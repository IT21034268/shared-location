4,A fresh look,With common core standards on their way in a veteran teacher said it sounds a lot like what they were doing...back in the day. She recommended this book.
3,"Analglyph stinks, Field-Sequential rocks!","This is a fun movie, I agree. However, I was disappointed with my VHS video, as only certain scenes are shown in 3D, NOT the entire film. (Robot Monster was entirely in 3Din this series.) My coverbox is exactly the same as the one pictured, but I'm wondering if Rhino put out more than one version. The analglyph 3D is unbearable, due in part to the fact that the up/down convergence is way off. I've seen segments of this film in Field-Sequential format on the Encounter in the Third Dimension DVD and it looks beautiful. If only someone would give it the treatment it deserves and put it out on DVD in both 2D and 3D field-sequential formats. If you don't know what field-sequential shutterglasses are, you haven't seen 3D video!!! See: The Ultimate 3D Collection. Now! Go look!"
3,The Moon As One Big Litterbox...,"Marie Windsor (Swamp Women) is part of a lunar exploration team that discovers giant spiders and cat-women on the dark side of the moon. Said cat-women (played by the Hollywood Cover Girls) are the final remnants of a once flourishing society. Now they seek to steal the team's rocket and conquer the earth! CWOTM isn't a total loss, but it can be rough on normal-brained viewers! You must keep in mind that it was made in the 50s, at a cost of about 42. This will help get you through the majority of the dullness and jaw-shattering dialogue. The middle-aged earth males are about as heroic and verile as Homer Simpson, yet neither Ms. Windsor nor the Cat-women can resist them! It must be the moon's thin atmosphere. The black leotard-wearing cat-babes look more like beat club waitresses than alien marauders! Still, this movie has it's own imbecilic charm. Watch it w/ MESA OF LOST WOMEN, PREHISTORIC WOMEN, and WILD WOMEN OF WONGO for a complete estrogen explosion..."
3,Where do you start here?,"OK; let's try. Take cheesy special effects, a totally illogical plot, bad scenery, Victor Jory and Sonny Tufts, for God's sake, then toss in Marie Windsor in all her bad girl/B movie glory, and finally all these women in leotards and black stockings that do strange dances. How could you not want to own it??"
2,Painful at points,"I'm a fan of bad scifi, and I came to this with low expectations, but it still managed to disappoint. It wasn't utterly terrible, and if forced to chose between this and Plan 9, it would have to be this. But I can't say I got my money's worth, and this was a 3 dollar rental. ""Weak acting"" sums it up very well. And some of the worst sets I have ever seen in any scifi.Words fail me on the dance scene. Unless you're a fan of pointless, ridiculous gesturing and posturing, fast forward is your best option. There are some things that tight body suits just don't make up for."
3,"Bad, but FUN!","This one is right up there with the worst of Doctor Who!There's some insipid sci-fi science (even for the '50s), like handguns on the lunar surface and a cigarette vaporizing when it crosses from the dark side of the moon into the light side (complete with hard-edged line between the two). And there's a rubber spider that's pretty Doctor Who-ish (William Hartnell ran into a giant foam bee along the same lines). The 3D effects do not work, either.But the movie is a must-see just for laughability! It's literaly so bad it's good! And the Catwomen are actually pretty sexy. Well, kinda.Anyway, the price is right, so buy the darn thing!"
1,"This isn't even fun to watch, not ""Queen of Outer Space"" worthy!","I purchased this movie thinking that it would be in the same league as ""Queen of Outer Space"" with Zsa Zsa Gabor. ""Queen"" was a hilarious, campy, over-the-top tongue-in-cheek female-dominated planet movie. It's hilarious from beginning to end and totally entertaining in a ridiculous way. It's funny as heck.""Cat women of the Moon"" just plain sucked! It takes itself so seriously, the plot is horrific, it's SUPER short, black and white (the cover leads one to believe it is colorized?), the characters are bland and just plain dumb! My wife and sat in disbelief at how BAD this flick was when it was over....There are some of those movies that are ""so bad they're good."" This is NOT one of those! Movies like ""Dracula vs. Frankenstein,"" ""Laserblast,"" ""Plan Nine from Outer Space,"" ""Frogs,"" ""Empire of the Ants,"" etc. are all so corney that they are just a blast to watch. ""Cat Women"" just plain is cruddy. Don't waste the nine bucks!!"
3,decide for youself,I think this is one of the better ones. It was good but I was annoyed with the quarrelling astronauts. The movie then turned into a drama of how the poor cat women were falling for the scientists and then the supirior cat women go ga ga over the quarrlesome earth man. Why couldnt the cat women come out on top? I liked the theme song. The kind of movie you could leave running before going to bed.
2,Female domination,This movie is not as good as the sequel but is a must for fan of female-run planets buffs.The big spiders are funny for their time. Wish I could find a place to meet girls like the ones in this movie.
5,Add this one to your world pop collecion,"I came across this band accidentally, thinking they were Sergio Mendez and Brasil 66, but it turned out to be Los Machucambos doing their amazing version of ""Brazil"". Although that one isn't on this cd, there are other great Latin American songs here. My favorite by far is ""El Octorrinolaringologo""-- it's filled with energy, has layered melodies, and a great latin beat. I think the band just does classic Latin American songs, but they do it well thanks in part to the female lead singer. Her voice is so strong that in ""Chocukue"" (song #8), they almost sounds like the Spanish version of Jefferson Airplane. Other familiar tunes on this album are ""Quizas"" and ""Cucurrucucu"" (Wong Kar-wai fans may remember this one from the ""Happy Together"" soundtrack). If you like bossa nova and 60's French pop and Italian cinema/lounge music, I highly suggest you give this one a try."
4,"Pretty good, easy to prepare","Well after seeing the review for the scrambeled eggs I thought I would give this a try. I have a camping trip coming up so just in case I busted a few out to see if they would work.The Bandidto scramble was good. It says two servings, although I ate the whole deal and was stuffed. It would work for 2 people if you had something else small to split like a granola bar. I used almost boiling water and was worried that the bag would melt. One cup as the direction states. The bag held up fine. Made sure to wait the 10 minutes it states for the rehydration. Pretty darn good. It will take a bit to prepare in the a.m. to boil water and wait. What hot breakfast does not?The granola dish was good too. Also easy to prepare. Have not tried the other yet and if it sucks I'll add a comment here in the future."
1,My mal,"They came in on time and undamaged. So I had to check these out to see how they taste so I started with the breakfast banditos. Ok, opened it up and they were mostly powered. Followed the directions and waited the 12 minutes. The mix looked liked the cosistentacy of wall paper paste. So I cooked them up like scrambled eggs and still stayed about the same. So far not looking so good. It tasted like Elmer's kid'glue with a horrible after taste I cannot describe.. I could not eat more than a few spoonfuls because I could not get over the after taste killed my taste buds and stomach. The potatoes never fully rehydronated themselves. I will save these for the last of my ratios if I ever come across the need to be that hungry, I think I rather eat insects first. Terrible taste not worth buying or giving away either. Total waste of money. I had eat a full meal with glass of milk to get rid of the bad taste."
5,An excellent introduction to multicultural management!,"This book gives real-world examples of how to successfully interact with other cultures. I recommend it to other business persons who, like myself, either travel abroad or work with people from various cultures, especially Asia and the Middle East."
1,Not the book you need,"This is not so much a book... more a collection of magazine cuttings. There are far too many short stories about other bands, mainly used in my opinion as a name-dropping exercise. There is very little actual information of any practical value, other than a few obvious references to writing better songs and presenting them to the right people. There was no indication of how to write a better song, or who the right people are, or even how to go about finding them. So much for marketing information.The writer goes on to explain that someone DID market their own album successfully. May as well have said that someone DID land on the moon, but no indication of HOW to go about preparing your music (or your spaceship) to do the same.Very disappointing all round, or maybe my expectations were a little high, which is also possible, isn't it."
5,They are great!,"I just finished reading your books (""The Interactive Music Handbook"" and ""Making and Marketing Music"") Congratulations. They are great!"
5,a treasury of lost teachings,"This book is essential for those students who wish to study art seriously, and to make themselves capable enough draftmen in order to paint. It is a complete reproduction of the ""fabled but rare"" drawing course used in Gerome's studio in nineteenth century Paris, comprising multiple levels of cast drawings, master-copies and linear life-drawings designed specifically to train the student's eye for painting.The plates are meant for study, to be copied by the student for several purposes; mainly serving as an introduction to the academic drawing process, but also as an artistic and anatomical reference for showing what is essential in form - Bargue, as a teacher, is unmatched in this respect.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the study and/or appreciation of fine drawing, and cannot thank the Dahesh museum enough for compiling it!"
5,Excellent Read,"This book is so good! Once you start you cant stop reading until the unbelieveable, unimaginable ending. It combines Love, Life and Religion all into one fascinating storyline. Any woman can relate to Catrina's situation and feel compassion for her because we all have made those not so smart decisions in the name of Love that we wish we could reverse. I highly recommend this book!"
5,MJ Review,"I loved this book! Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I thought it touched a lot of real life especially because God tests our faith in real life. Catrina had quite a burden to fall on her, and still she recaptured her faith in God.I've recommended this book to many people. It's a great book!"
2,"Wow Lau, I can't believe that was so bad","This is the film that Master Lau Kar Leung went to make after leaving the set of drunken master 2(with Jackie Chan). I think he was fired but doubt he would ever admit it and no way in hell I would question him. This movie here has to be one of the top 3 or 4 worst movies Lau has ever directed. There is no drunken style in this movie except a couple of mentions of it, seriously. There was one scene where I cracked a smile but that was all the enjoyment I got out of this movie. So we have Gordon Liu in this, along with superstars Andy Lau, Lau Kar Leung, Michelle Reis, Simon Yam , and Adam Cheng. Then we have some white guy who is supposed to be the main bad guy and he is like 5 foot 5 inches weighing in at maybe 140 pounds. Too many problems to go over but I will sum it up by saying that Andy Lau was the ONLY character that I enjoyed. When Andy Lau is the only good thing in a Lau Kar Leung film, we have serious problems."
5,Intimate and Energetic,"Ben gives a very energetic performance, and really seems to connect with the crowd."
4,Good purchase -- especially with DVD,"Great sample of Ben Fold's music. I do kind of miss the band, but his piano playing is fantastic, and his version of Tiny Dancer was great (completely inspired by Almost Famous).Small negative comment -- Army contained a bit too much crowd participation. I'm not a big fan of when the artist points his mic to the crowd during a chorus. Most of the time, you can't hear anything."
4,Great,"This is a great CD. I had always enjoyed Ben Folds Five, but I only had a promo copy of Whatever & Ever Amen. One night flipping channels I came across the video of his version of Elton John's Tiny Dancer. I had never been a huge fan of Elton John or that song, but I was struck by Ben's version. I went out and bought the CD for that song, also knowing I did enjoy Ben Folds and wanted some more of his music. I figured this live album would be a perfect choice. I was absolutely floored by how much I enjoyed this CD. His playing is fantastic and there are a number of great ballads which I hadn't been exposed to. I also enjoyed the crowd participation on the more upbeat numbers I was familiar with. In short this is a excellent CD of a piano player who crafts great songs. I would easily put him in the company of Billy Joel, Elton John, Tori Amos and other greats of the form."
5,The most underrated musician in the histoy of music,"Mozart. Beethoven. Folds. That's where I rank Ben Folds in the lexicon of music. The man is a genius, plain and simple. His music is funny, thought-provoking, and emotionally strong, sometimes in the same song. This disc really shows Ben Folds at his greatest, behind a piano. It doesn't matter if it's just him and a piano or if he's with Darren and Robert as ""the Five.""The man is brilliant. Period."
3,decent cd with a couple good songs on it,"this is a decent cd. I wish the songs were more upbeat and I miss the rest of the band, but the cover of Tiny Dancer definately helped."
1,Waste of Money,This was smaller than anticipated. It lasted for 1 use then lost both air and suction. This is a very poorly made product. Don't waste your money.
3,Average All the Way,"I ordered this product 7 months ago and have been relatively happy with it. Though when I first bought it the recommended shipping time was way out of proportion as to when it actually shipped, It took a week longer than I expected it to take.Be careful when ordering this product for you will probably only get a few months of use out of it. I am very unhappy about the fact that this bath pillow started to leak air after 5 months of occasional use. now at 7 months it will not hold any air. The leak seems to be around the top suction cups. This might be a manufacturing defect."
2,Bath pillow,Pillow was all right but my color was out of stock. The seller claimed to have sent an em ail but I never received it. Had to call when order did not arrive.
1,worthless,"I bought 2 bath pillows. They each lasted one bath, then they no longer kept air in them. Worthless."
4,Pretty good,"It's pretty comfortable and easy to store, also the material is nice. Being inflatable it can be sometimes be troublesome to use because the suction cups sometimes aren't strong enough so it floats back up and you have to adjust it again. (but maybe that wouldn't be a problem if you secured it -before- filling up the tub..)My only problem with it is that it doesn't work well with my bathtub, because the bath wall is close to the edge of the tub therefore it cannot be moved to comfortably lay down. So the pillow is more ideal for sitting up in the tub if you have a closed-in or small bathtub.But overall it's a good pillow. I didn't have trouble with inflating it but I can't tell you how well it lasts, considering I don't take baths often."
2,It was a bust!,Within two weeks this bath pillow had a hole and leaked air. I tried patching but it didn't work. Save your money and buy something better.
4,good pillow,The pillow works well and is comfortable. The suction cups do not always hold it in place.
1,"Used to be good, not anymore","I have been ordering these for the last 2 years. Previously, I had no complaints. They would last a few months, get a leak, and I would replace it. I always ordered 5 at a time. In the last batch, 4 out of 5 pillows leaked THE FIRST TIME I used it, I emailed the manufacturer, but have heard nothing back. Save your money."
1,Poor craftmanship,The first Spa Sister Cotton Terry Bath Pillow I purchased sprang a leak within two weeks. The retailer replaced it without charge. The replacement sprang another leak within one month. I've purchased two other brand bath pillows. Both lasted for years. I cannot recommend this item.
2,plug comes out!,"this would have been great,but a month of using it and the plug won't stay in to keep it inflated! I have tried a bunch of mickey mouse things to stop it from popping out when i lean on it at all, but no luck. Now will need to buy a new one."
5,The Diseased minds of the power elite,"I give this book 5 stars because it is a nicely rappped package of evidence that should be shown to anyone who doubts what is going on. It is essentially a blueprint for the enslavement of free thinking humanity and a perfect road map for global genocide. Russell is giving us a small look into the diseased mind of the people who have gotten control of the world power apparatus. So if you think this scum bag is smart because he won a nobel peace prize thats good just keep drinking your flouride, worship the government and act cool, or you can join them and help kill your fellow man in order to ""save the earth"" what u don't want to save the earth awww come on you only have to keep the population below 500 million come on just kill everyone that sounds like fun yea. Give me Liberty or give me Death"
1,Nasty,"This album by Coldspot 8 left me bored. Simplistic, basic, boring. Get an edge, boys. From someone not living in Florida."
4,Confessions of a star,"Joe Pepitone's autobiography does not always reflect kindly on him. In this look at the sexual side of baseball, Pepitone examines not so much his successes as his failures; as a husband, father, and a could-have-been superstar. Pepitone attributes a portion of his flaws to his troubled upbringing and near addiction to sex, but also accepts responsibility. Young Pepitone seemed to have it all; charm, charisma, superb baseball talent, and Italian-American heritage playing in his hometown (New York) with many thousands of Italian-American fans. Yet he was immature and insecure, eager to flee his problems, and probably clinically depressed - at a time when issues like depression were rarely discussed. One wonders how many other athletes and celebrities face similar ordeals and keep them hidden. This is a pretty good baseball book, one where the subject both celebrates his triumphs and confesses his failures."
2,Not An Effective Labor Movement,"Pretty mediocre big-labor cheerleading without any real insights or critique. I'm a big fan of working-class organizing, but Mort simply ignores all sorts of challenges facing the modern labor movement, particularly the ongoing role of race and citizenship. One contributor relates a story of flying to Bangladesh to meet with workers there and returning determined to start them a union -- reinforcing not only a historical pattern of white ""social uplift"" but also reflecting the AFL-CIO's narrow idea of establishing unions rather than organizing the working class -- not all of whom might be currently employed or in traditional jobs.A useful book on the modern labor movement requires a certain amount of distance, to say nothing of an awareness of the complexities of class, race and nationality. This simply isn't it."
1,Too much vibration,I am very disappointed with the vibration of the light reflector. The unit is mounted fine and exhibits no vibration. Attaching the light fixture introduces the vibration. Poor design and the noise is distracting. I would not purchase again and would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Fan light,For the money it is a very good deal. The light and the fan work and it is very quiet. For a small bathroom it is good choice.Could not get a 60 watt flouresent bulb into it. Needs some redsign to fit energy efficient bulbs into it.
2,Buy a better product,"Three of these models were installed in our house when it was built. One fan lasted less than 2 years, one lasted less than 7 years, and the third still works. They do move some air, but do you really want to replace your ceiling exhaust fan every few years?"
1,Stunningly poor design and quality,"Worst bathroom fan I've ever encountered, by far. I have four of these that were installed by the builder of my 6 year old house and have had to replace the motors multiple times in two of them. The noise coming from them after is about the same as you would hear standing behind an idling diesel city bus - just awful. I'm planning to rip them all out as they each fail (which they all will no doubt) and replace them with non-Broan units. Don't waste your time or money on these inferior products!"
5,QUIET!,"This looks great, works great and is super quiet....hardly know it is on at all. I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,Poor circulation / low light,The air circulation is very poor and the light isn't very bright - the two primary functions of the unit. Beyond that there's a air dam that rocks back-and-forth when it's windy outside; which is very frustrating due to the noise it makes when rocking back-ad-forth. I bought this to replace a non-lighted fan and will not use in the remaining bathrooms.
2,Did not last long and noisy,"Bought this about 3 years ago at Lowes and it stopped working. Found that the fan is not gripping any longer because it started to hit the holding plate. Now the motor seems to be shot, and getting very hot. Will have to replace it."
2,Noisy and flimsy,"didn't buy this from Amazon, but it's the same model. I guess ""economy line"" should have raised a flag, but only after one day of working I found out that the motor is noisy, it puts too much vibration in the wood beams, and the plastic faceplate is so flimsy it sometimes vibrates in a different pitch than the rest of the thing. Next time I'll give the replacement a dry run before spending my time installing it.."
5,Broan/Nautilus 678 fan7light combo,In my case this was basically a straight swap of one unit for it's newer twin. The instructions were perfect and the hardware and brackets were correct.The fan has been up and running for almost two months now and is quiet and efficient.
4,Good but vibrates,You have to insert some plastic buffers in between the light cover the plastic air intake to stop the vibrating sound. But it is easy to install and looks good.
3,"Not a bad fan for the size, still it's not as quiet as I'd like","Good fan for the price. The manufacturer made changes in it, you can no longer replace the motor or any of the insides as you could to previous models made by this company. It works nice, just a bit more noise than I'd like."
5,"Great fan, great price, quiet","My wife and I installed fan in about an hour. Expected noise problem after reading review. Very quiet, attractive, excellent value. Instructions in so many languages, be careful. Tip, the light assembly installs in the housing, the wiring cover is tricky.Tom, Little River, SC."
1,"A noisy, short life","We put this fan in as a new installation. It did the job but for its size it's noisy - could be the loose fit of the plastic grille. After about 6 months the fan quit, though the light continued to work. We finally got around to checking it out yesterday and the problem is the unit itself, not the wiring to the switch as we'd hoped. For much less than a year of use I feel this Broan fan was a terrible value."
1,Misleading description,"Amazon's description is deceptive and fraud-based. The description clearly indicates that this fan has a 100 watt light and a 7 watt nightlight. You find out, however, upon receipt, that that option is only available on one of the 3 options, so the main description is, in fact, untrue. This fan, as shown, has a 100 watt light. There is no nightlight. If you wanted the product that is described, you would have to purchase a round light, which, if you read the reviews, is so noisy, that you have to shim the cover to keep it from rattling. So, the fan that is described, is actually quite a bit more expensive than the fan depicted."
1,Noisey,I bought this product to replace the one that was installed in my bathroom but made too much noise. 6 month later and this one is making the same racket. The motor bearings develope too much slop which causes vibration. Trying to shim the duct and/or reflector is useless. Don't waste your money.
3,Loud Loud Loud.,Good functionality but very loud but mine has lasted three years so I guess that it is worth three stars.Now five years this unit is going the distance very impressed but still loud. if the engineers could make these quiet I would by stocks in this product.
1,Lost in translation,"The conversion to Kindle really stinks. The code portions are in really tiny type, the other portions are all out of whack. Somebody poured the print version into Kindle without even thinking. Very disappointed."
2,disappointed,It was not clear to me when I ordered this book that it was volume 2 (out of 2) and didn't contain the first three chapters.
1,Trash,"The photo of the pearls is totally misleading.Kind of round on one side and flat, knarly and dull on the other.Would be an embarassment to wear."
4,Funny and VERY Accurate,"Having worked in this industry for several years, I can tell you that this book is not only clever and funny, but it is also very accurate. I remember watching Director's work on ""Moonlighting"" and thinking that it was very special. Now I look forward to his next book"
5,Milwaukee tough,"The concept looks so simple that I wondered why no one had thought of this before. It wasn't until I received this set, that I realized how complex these bits are.There are several cutting surfaces on each bit that allows the bit to guide through the wood with ease. Even the angled holes that they advertise. These have become my number one boring bits.I should have ordered the 5 piece set to begin with, as I have already ordered the 2 that this set does not come with. I hope Milwaukee will make some larger sizes as well.Anyone who runs electrical or plumbing lines through framing will find these indispensable. Especially those odd hard to reach runs, in corners, around columns and supports, or anywhere you need to bore a hole."
5,Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet,"Luke's Proposal was based on Luke McCloud helping Rachel Kerrigan with her horse..Well, for a whole lot of years the McClouds and the Kerrigans have had a fued, so due to that they did not know if to trust eachother, but in the end they started to love eachother and now they are going to get married..Very good story, it made me think how ""Jessie's Child"" is going to be"
5,Why Can't People be More like Norman,"Although this is a book written for children, if you have ever owned a dog, you will love and appreciate ""Norman to the Rescue"". Author Loren Spiotta-DiMare and illustrator Kara Lee bring a touching, true story to life once again through sincere text and expressive pictures. Norman, a yellow Lab, once rescued himself, brings joy and happiness to his new family. As Norman faces his own tragedies, he manages to overcome them and prove once again that the unconditional love and loyalty of a dog is one of the most precious gifts a human can ever receive. This is a touching story that will warm the hearts and touch the souls of children of all ages. Stephanie Smith Editor TheTIMES...at the jersey shore Ocean Grove, New Jersey"
1,Waste of Time!,Only read this book if you want to learn what NOT to do as you float down the Mississippi!This idiot makes all kinds of mistakes and drinks like a fish the entire trip despite multiple promises to himself to keep his body pure on this trip.I learned a ton about planning my own trip down the river but that does NOT make this a five-star book!
1,Don't Bother,"If you're looking for information about traveling the Mississippi River, you would be better off reading anything by Mark Twain. If you're interested in an account of a solo paddler's spiritual journey, keep looking. If you want a story of a drunken frat boy who bar hops his way through a summer, and survives by sheer luck, add this to your reading list, but don't put it near the top of that list. It starts off with some promise. The author is fed up with the rat race, and claims he's been planning this escape down the river. Turns out that's more cliche than insite. As you read you learn he has been day dreaming rather than planning. It seems he has shoddy equipment, he is counting on his family to acquire maps as he goes, and he intends to 'not polute his body and mind with chemicals' on this journey, but ends up guzzling beer 'til he can't see straight every time he gets the chance."
4,"The adventure, from your own comfortable chair","Okay, so I am a distant cousin, but that doesn't cloud my review. I never even met the author until after I read the book. I enjoyed it because it was well written for a first book and the adventure takes place in such a fashion that I was able to be on the river with Matt, and yet be warm and dry in my own home. He does capture the flow and ebb of the river, I believe. Good use of terminology. It is a good read, since, after all, how many of us are going to take the actual ride?"
1,I have to agree with one star,"I actually disliked this book twice. The first time I read it I bought it in Grand Marais MN while camping. After reading it I agreed that it was one of the least enjoyable books I have ever read. I took it camping last week on accident, thinking it was a different book (holding up my futon). But no, I was forced to read it again. His constant typecasting of people while expressing his religious beliefs was ridiculous. I also liked the inner voice saying he was going to quit poisoning his body but instead did the exact opposite. I also think a lot of this tale was embellished a little. Anyway i'm tired, I don't normally write reviews but I just don't want anyone to make the same mistake I did. Next time maybe get some one to edit it before you publish it? later"
1,no good choices here,"This is not a book to choose. This book is mostly about the self centered poor choices make by the author. He never grows up in the course of his adventure on the Mississippi River. The book is about mooching, using people, looking for women, getting drunk, getting high, and being stupid on the River. I had hoped for a book about canoeing down the Mississippi River and was very disappointed."
5,Great Story !,"Obviously some people are a bit holier-than-thou in their opinions and are not really competant enough to review the book in an objective format (ditto for all the complaints about editing...like you could do better). If you are looking for a classic epic novel, or one with a history of the Mississippi, or a biography of the Mississippi, this is not the book. Go read War and Peace or Wikipedia. What this book is, is a chronicle of one mans journey down the river. It is written in a plainspoken manner that anyone who has listened to a good storyteller by a campfire can relate to and speaks to many people. The adventures that Matt runs into are fascinating, as are many of the people that he meets. He makes you want to grab a paddle, hop in the canoe with him and crack open a beer. The book is fairly fast paced and while it does have its luls, keeps the reader going. I recently got my hands on the newly updated version and was even more impressed."
3,More maudlin that I anticipated,My first disappointment was that there was no Slim and Howdy story! This CD was also a bit more maudlin that I had anticipated. I know it's what Ronnie does best but in a Christmas CD I would prefer a little less heartache. Winter Wonderland is done in a very upbeat Brooks and Dunn way and overall this is a fine CD.
2,Not so Merry Christmas,"Brooks & Dunn claim a lot of (eggnog affected?) thought went into the preparation of their holiday album. If so, it's not an accident that there's no hymns to be found on this dud. It Won't Be Christmas Without You leads off with a bombastic rendition of ""Winter Wonderland."" The Kix Brooks' led followup ""Rockin' Little Christmas"" is equally noisy, while the slower-paced ""Who Says There Ain't No Santa Claus"" and the closer ""White Christmas"" limp painfully by due to Brooks' extremely weak vocals. Ronnie Dunn's ballad ""It Won't Be Christmas Without You"" and his renditions of ""The Christmas Song"" and ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" are touching, however, and ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" does offer up some nice Brooks & Dunn harmonizing. Overall, though, it is a major disappointment."
5,works wonderfully,"It is actually a pack of 2 20-30 gallon filters. i would highly suggest getting 2 powerheads for this set up and only using one tube on each filter. it is set up to have 4tubes with noisy air bubblers. Power heads filter more water, create better circulation, and are much more quiet. My fish and i are quite happy with it."
4,Classic Mystery,I bought this book for my niece because I remember how much I enjoyed it when I was her age. It didn't dissapoint..in fact it has encouraged her to read more!
4,Great,"I really enjoyed reading this one, though it isn't my favorite. Still, all the Nancy Drew books are great, and no matter what you ALWAYS wind up getting pulled into them. I suggest this one greatly."
5,One of My Favorite Nancy Drew Books So Far!,"This is a kind-of suspensing book. My favorite part is all the seceret compartments and and when things get stolen at the b-day party! If you get this book, enjoy!"
3,"It was great, but ...",The book was great but personally I think the original was better (the one where no one was impersonating Nancy).
4,The intro by original author of series worth the price!,"I love the original versions of the books in this series that Applewood Publishing has been printing. If you are a Mother who read the series, these make excellent books for your daughters who love to read and like a good mystery!The illustrations are great.The dialogue is dated, but only leads to the charm of these books.The true author's name was Mildred Wirt Benson, a ghost writer from the MidWest.She was the first graduate of journalism from the University of Iowa.She writes an introduction to this book that is worth the price of the book alone!Not my favorite in the series, but it still evokes the spirit of the 30's and the fun I had curling up and devouring these books on a rainy weekend afternoon."
4,My personal Opinion,"I love this book. I have read in before and I have rated it a 4-star book. Only one star away from the tops. The only reason I didn't make this a 5 star is the criminal, whom I won't say, you don't know him/her untill the very end. And I like to figure out the mystery as I read the books which I couldn't do here, but the events that happen in here and the way the story line just clicks, makes up for that! From canoe crashes to stolen diamonds, this book has it all!"
2,the Mystery at Lilac Inn,"Replacement book for library. I returned the one I had checked out for my niece, but the library couldn't find it. Niece enjoyed book. The Mystery at Lilac Inn"
5,classic reading,given as Christmas gift to granddaughter and hope she would enjoy them as much as I did as a preteen
3,"Great book, but not the original.",This is by far my favorite Nancy Drew book. It is not the original though. The original Nancy Drew books were twice this size and were not even written by Carolyn Keene. That is a pen name. The real book was written by the Frank Dixon (Hardy Boys Author) Despite the flaws this is a good read.
4,A book full of mystery,Nancy Drew and the lilac inn is a book full of mystery.From reading the frist 3 chapters the book begins to get puzzling and confussing to themind.The strange avents that follow one after the other make it longer to finish. This book dose not contain the best or average wonder and thrill as the other Nancy Drew books.You will only very very enjoy this book if you are...* a person who can really really be paitent and can wait a long time without getting bored* a person who likes taking risks and likes books with risk takers in them*a person who likes dangerIf you are not a person with all theese guiltys then you will noy strongly like this book.I recomend that you read Nancy Drew and the Secret of the old attic
2,I found it a bit boring...,"I read the 1930 version. The book was well written, but never managed to hold my intrest for some reason. I just found it boring."
5,I DON'T SEE WHY I CAN ONLY RATE IT FIVE OR UNDER!,This book is LOADED with SUSPENSE and if I could Iwould rate it eighteen! If you're the type who likes mysteries where you're in SUCH suspense you're sitting on the edge of you're chair waiting for the next thing to happen-I know you'd rate it eighteen too!
4,"Once you begin, you won't forget the mystery at Lilac Inn.","This novel was very well written. This novel sends you through a journey to figure out the mystery. Nancy Drew and her friend, Helen, are on their way to visit their friend, Emily, at Lilac Inn. Strange things begin to happen; Nancy's cottage at Lilac Inn blows up, jewels and tools are stolen, and many strange noises are heard by the visitors at Lilac Inn. Nancy's charge plate is missing and she feels that someone is trying to impersonate her. There is somebody out there who is trying to put Nancy Drew in danger and its your job to figure out who is causing all the trouble at Lilac Inn!"
5,I have read 31 Nancy Drew books and this was one of the best,"My mom read Nancy Drew books when she was a girl and only remembers her favorite ones. When she saw the title, she said to me she remembered it very well. Obviously, she did! She made me fall asleep telling me about the whole thing!!"
4,As eloquent as ever,"This album, Blue Indians, is long overdue! Trudell is finally back with his 3rd CD, and he's as eloquent as ever. Still angry, still loving; sarcastic, sad, and still chuckling... Raw poetry, carried by great rock music; bluesy blues, swinging blues, and sometimes even a little jazzy (""Dizzy Duck""); with just the right dose of djembe beats; and the excellent backing vocals of Mark Shark, Billy Watts, and --of course-- Quiltman. Tradional sounds interweaved with the sharp electric sounds of this modern day & age. DNA. Next time, JT, don't wait so long in between releases... or make a double CD! :)Elsie Herten - KOLA International Campaign Office"
3,The oromo of ethiopia- HIdden truth,"The oromo of ethiopia is the third single largest nation in Africa yet strange to the world. Why? The history of oromo has been ignored. The language and the land has been abused. It was not by any direct international power but by royal family tribes of Amhara. Now It is time to tell the story which I call the hidden truth of one of Africas largest nationality-The oromo and their country Oromia.The Book the Oromo of Ethiopia by Mr. Mohammed Hassen, is a wonderful start to introduce the rich but neglected culture and identity of Oromos. I thank Amazon.com for bringing this book up to my search result and many will benefit from it. I've never thought I will find a book like this one from Amazon.com.Thanks a million."
5,The Only of its Kind,"This book is the only comprehensive study of Oromo history available. To negate what the fellow below said about Dr. Hassen not carrying on oral traditions, he is wrong. Dr. Hassen is an Oromo who grew up in the Ethiopian city of Harar, where Oromo tradition is extremely strong and has played a strong role in the traditional feudal system during the era the book discusses. I've had the great opportunity of having Dr. Hassen as a professor at Georgia State University, and believe me, this field is his level of expertise, and most historians choose to cite his material for their own research regarding the subject."
1,Yonatan,"As an Ethiopian (and as an oromo myself) I am aware of various grievances agains Ethiopia that are being raised by the Oromo people. I am trying to educate myself of these grievances and their validity. I have not yet read this book, and I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the Author's comments on his intentions of bridging the gap between the peoples of Ethiopia. Of late, I have been very discouraged by the level of negativity directed at Ethiopia from oromo's and organizations of such. I hope I will not be disappointed and that I will be able to write a good review of the book once I have read it."
1,Not the book I needed,Got this book for my biology class...was so old they wouldn't buy it back from a bookstore and we never needed the book. Hate professors like that.
4,A fun family movie!,"I have always been a fan of Kelsey Grammer and when this movie was first release on television I had no idea that it even existed. I just happened to come across it some years ago on one channel or another and started watching. Before I knew it I feel in love with this movie. It is whimsical and smart, and without giving away any points of the movie it does show what writers everywhere sometimes have to do to 'do' what they love. I think anyone with a fun spirit and is a child at heart will love this movie - as Kelsey Grammer (Howard Spitz) learned that he is also a child at heart even though he doesn't really like children. Enjoy!"
1,Please don't waste your money!,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son and helped him put it together. Unfortunately, it does not stand up to play. He can't play with it at all without it coming apart. The bridge continually falls off its supports, the steering column falls off the boat, the tree top and base fall off the tree, etc. etc. It's nothing but aggravation for him and me, because he's constantly getting frustrated and asking me to help him put it back together. Total junk!"
5,A Fun Time with a Great Keyboardist,"Been a Rick Wakeman fan since the mid-70s when he was with Yes. Saw him solo in Chicago back in 1976 at McCormack Theater. This is a great DVD showing both his expertise and his sense of humor. Some might prefer a different selection of music, but I truly enjoyed this. He is remarkable and this shows his virtuosity very well."
2,"Good playing, few funny stories","I was under the impression that this show was in the same format as that of the one-man shows that Rick has done throughout the Eastern US in the fall of 2003 (""The Other Side of Rick Wakeman""). Sadly, while in the introduction he says he will be telling many true and funny stories, there are either non-existent or have been cut out of the DVD. 95% of the video is just him playing his best-known pieces. He only tells one full-length story (of being drunk on stage in Seattle in 1976).If you are a fan of Rick's music, you won't be disappointed by the musicianship of this DVD. But if you're looking for a video full of hysterical anecdotes, go see him live instead."
5,Simply Beautiful,"Not often am I prompted to write a review, but this DVD is special. Simply stated, it's beautiful. The anecdotes are funny and insightful, the music is ""nothing short of spectacular"".If you are a fan of Rick Wakeman, this DVD is a must. If you would like an introduction to Rick Wakeman, this DVD is a must. If you would like a spend 120 minutes being thoroughly entertained, this DVD is a must.A wonderful fusion of music styles flawlessly combined to showcase his keyboard versitility. Simply beautiful."
3,Two CD's - Same Title,Ordered the wrong cd (my error)and did not notice until it was unwrapped and played. No problem at all with the ordering and shipping. Was able to purchase a used cd by the artist I had originally intended to get and that worked satisfactorily. Will use Amazon again.
5,Surrendering,Turly inspiring album. The song titled I Will Listen allows your soul to personally and privately surrender...to God. It is very reassuring after listening to the song to know God is going to be with you and it is a matter if we decide to Listen to him. It has helped me to get through a difficult time in my life....Very encouraging vocals.
5,One of Twila's best,"This is one of my favorite Twila albums. The lyrics are insightful and thought-provoking. ""What Did He Die for?"" is a perfect example of that. And most of the melodies are catchy. ""Faithful Friend"" is a beautiful tribute to Christian fellowship, which makes this album a good gift for your best friend."
3,not sure how well it works,"it was more of a preventative maintenance precaution but, I added 1 bottle to my oil and fuel and am getting ready to change it now at least a month later, I check it regularly and it isn't dirty yet which could be precision Swedish craftsmanship or, I wasted some money on a product I didn't really need. My car is running great and am hopeful about the other two bottles I have as one is going in my fathers truck he left me and the other I'm saving for when/if it's really needed. I have ran STP cleaner through it previously pretty regular which might be the reason it isn't really cleaning much else out."
2,DON'T PUT IN THE ENGINE WITH MOTOR OIL,"Had 170 thousand miles on my Sienna. After reading all the great reviews about this product and decided to try it. follow all directions, put in intake, fuel tank and engine. Car started to leaking oil after 1 week putting sea foam in engine. after 2 weeks,leak gets worst, so changed oil and put Lucas stop leak in. No luck, still leaks as of today. Sea foam kills seals people, don't put it in your old car engine."
3,good cleaner,"i am using this product very often. it is for oil, intake manifold and for gas also. but it is little bit hard to use. you need some tools and DIY works to clean intake manifold."
2,Solvents,"Google the MSDS on this, it's naptha and alcohol. I've been an automotive technician for 15+ years, have never and will never recommend this stuff."
3,Sea Foam-16 Motor Treatment,"Didn't work as we thought, but ok, we brought it to try it. Great product to try out and see if it works for you."
5,good stuff,"this is good stuff, it came highly recommended by posters on several motorcycle forums. after one use my old bike is running considerably better."
4,excellent solvent,This product is an excellent solvent. In the oil pan it helps to dissolve gum and varnish buildup. I usually use about a 1/3 can per use. I'm told it's useful as a fuel additive as well.
4,Fixed hard start and rough idle.,"I have a 2006 Toyota Matrix that would always seem like it was struggling to start. It was almost like it had a weak battery, but it tested fine. At idle the car would also vibrate just enough to rattle loose objects in the car. I used two cans in a 1 gal to 1 oz ratio and everything cleared right up! Just FYI a lot of brick and motor stores carry this product cheaper."
5,Amazing results on my 14 year old Honda,"Never heard of Sea Foam until my friend told me about it. Did my research and read many positive reviews, so I decided to buy and try.Very easy to use. I have a 98 Honda Prelude and I poured half the can in the gas tank and the remaining half into the vacuum house of the brake booster.Turn off the car and wait for 10-15 minutes and start the car. If your car's engine is dirty inside, you will see all the white smoke come out of the exhaust.After a week has past by and I can surely feel the car is running a lot smoother without the ""pinging"" and idles much better.Give it a try and see. Plus the price on amazon is the cheapest I have seen compare to other stores."
5,This is not snake oil,This is the best fuel additive out there. Used regularly will keep fuel system clean and prolong the usefullness of present day fuels.Have been using for about 10 years and swear by it.
4,It does what is promissed,It does a job if you will follow directions.Very strong product do not overdo.I've used to clean my tank and gas supply.
3,love the color!,Too small. It's a great product for a small dog. Our dog just grew too fast. We got it for our puppy but she out grew it in two weeks.
3,Camo dog harness,"I bought this item for my dog. I used her current harness to measure it. It was 27"" from end to end. When I got the new one it stated able to adjust from 20-28"". I adjusted it all the way out and it was too small. So I returned it for a refund. If you order this dog harness order the larger on like 28""-36"","
5,Luscious,"I have this recording on a CD on Sam Goody's Excelsior label. Who is Isidora Schwarzberg-Romanoff? Based on this CD, she is a very fine violinist, with a big tone and lots of technique. This is one of the most satisfying Beethoven violin albums I know of. Tempos are somewhat leisurely but mainstream. The soloist's playing is consistently invigorating in the Concerto, but with an equal sense of the work's solace. The Romances are lyrical and consoling, with the soloist playing with great control. Throughout, the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra under the veteran Saulius Sondeckis plays beautifully, especially the winds. There is no sense of the orchestal sound being undernourished because it is performed by a chamber orchestra. The sound engineering is excellent, on the resonant side but highly pleasant nevertheless. This CD really is quite a find."
3,The worst DOTM book so far.,"Well, we have a new daughter, Tianna. Sh wakes up with no memories, only note written by her saying someone is trying to kill her. She meets some strange girls(of of whose boyfriend she tries to steal) that watch her carefully.Honestly, Tianna doesn't have much of a personality. Its not very exciting to read about her. You have to read it if you're a DOTM fan(like me), but be prepared for a little disapointment."
5,The best series ever,My favorite thing to do is read. I love these books because it's interesting the way Greek mythology gets into the stories and the way the end always twists so what you think is going to happen doesn't happen. I like Vanessa the most but I like Catty's power to time travel the best. I like this book because you get to find out what really happened to Catty. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone but it's really good.
1,This was sad!,"The other books were so great but this was horrible, I cannot believe Lynne Ewing brought in a new character. Tianna is portrayed as so cool because she can ride a skateboard, has this series really become this (bad)? The author had such a great series going and this book made me mad, not only did it have NO PLOT, but she brought in some chick who isn't even a daughter! I could begin to comprehend the purpose of this book if she was a daughter, but she isnt. Its horrible. Im getting repetative so Ill just say I still think you should read it because it does play a role in the series, but I would recommend reading it sometime when life is boring because it can ruin any good day."
5,daughters of the moon:the lost one,"This is a great book. I think it was a good idea to add a daughter of the moon and Tianna is perfect for the job.First, Tianna finds hershelf lost. She doesn't know who she is our anything about hershelf. She goes to La Brea high and meets the daughters of the moon and then she stats to understand what their about.Next, she starts seeing Catty and tells the daughters of the moon. Then Staton is back in the picture(that's ok Staton rocks) and helps them find Catty.In the end Tianna finds a guy like the rest and becomes a daughter of the moon."
5,Yet another excellent book in the series,"I absolutly loved this book. My friends and I have read all the other books in the series. I was actually worried that Ewing was going to replace Catty in the 6th book, but I've very glad that she added Tianna to the mix instead. I think a fifth Daughter of the Moon will make a nice addition and give the author more to play off of for following storylines. I can't wait for the 7th book to come out, and I hope there are many more following that one. Thanks Ms. Ewing, for a wonderfully exciting teen series!"
5,Who is Tianna?,"The prologue on this book is spooky and got me to spend the money to buy it. It's creepy. The story goes on about Tianna when she is lost in Los Angeles and gets in a home with a very weathly woman who takes in problem kids that have no place to stay because no one wants them. The Daughters of the Moon find Tianna and want to help her but she doesn't think they are good. Maybe she thinks they are even witches, and not the good kind plus she wants Vanessa's boyfriend!!!! I thought Michael liked her, too. It's a good ending with a surprise for Tianna."
3,tianna annoys me and is a jerk at times........,"i think that lynne ewing should've stayed with the original daughters, i don't really think that she should be a daughter since she wasn't born one, it doesn't seem right right to me"
5,you have to raed them all!!,is about tianna who wakes up one day to find that she doasnt know who she is. and findes a note in her shoe. and so she tries to find out who she is she meets the daughters of the moon. and soon she figures out she can move objects with her mind. and that if she tries hard enougf she can go into a whole other dimention. and finds something there that the daugters need to know. i thought it was a really good book and the other are just as good.
4,My Thoughts on Tianna,When my friend said that there was a sixth book I had to read it. When i started reading it I thought Tianna was a complete jerk by trying to take away Michael from Vanessa. I thought she was going to replace Catty. I hated the thought that she was until i read it. Then I felt wierd about the fact that there might be a Fifth Daughter of The Moon. But It's cool how she helps them and they become close friends.
3,QC issues,"Great music, but the quality of sound is very poor compared to today's standards. Buy it from another manufacturer."
4,"Not a Knock-Off, it stands on its own!","Mention this title and most folks roll their eyes, ""Oh, just some lame knock-off of the Newman/Redford classic,"" but not so. This is a really fun and funny movie! It was made years after the Redford/Newman movie, so it wasn't just a rush to make a fast buck before the popularity wore off. The story is solid, the cinematography beautiful and it's filled with little touches that put it a cut above most westerns.Directed by Richard Lester, who brought us, among other things, A Hard Day's Night, Help and Superman II, but it also has an all-star cast BEFORE THEY WERE STARS! You can see Tom Berenger, William Katt, Jill Eikenberry, Brian Dennehy, Christopher Lloyd and Peter Weller, all before they became famous. Well worth a look, a pleasant surprise for all those tired of being disappointed by overly hyped crap at the video store."
5,"""Butch"" wins again!","""Butch & Sundance: an excellent film in all respects. Story & acting are outstanding: both clever and funny. It's the perfect prelude to ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"". Kudos to Tom Berenger for another amazing performance, especially walking in Paul Newman's boots."
2,ZZZZZZ,I am a major William Katt fan. I want all his movies. But this one? I have yet to make it thru without falling asleep. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
2,Not good at all...,Tom Barrenger and William katt star as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. Only watched the video once and it sat in my video cabinet collecting dust. Tom barrenger's role as Butch Cassidy was better then the Sundance Kid role played by William Katt. Butch was the one that was trying to show him the ropes of being a GOOD outlaw.. William Katt comes across as a stuffy know it all. At one point in the film he KICKS a guy in the knee! OVERGROWN BABY!!! If you want to see a true western please check out the original Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid... This one is not watchable over time. Once was quite enough for me.
3,"Not bad, complicated in places, but watchable!","This movie is just one of those B-movie wonders that spring out by the dozen over the course of the year. They aren't made to really affect you in any way, but moreover are created to hopefully illuminate the careers of either some budding young actors, or rekindle those of some Hollywood has-beens! Well, 'Feedback' is the tale of how a trip back in time via a phone line can either save lives or change destiny's - for the better or for the worse! Sure, it's all been done before and sure the phone used is just silly, but the premise is interesting, the acting solid and the ending worthwhile!"
2,THE PHONE MACHINE,"FEEDBACK is a time travel movie, but not your typical physical time travel. Rather we have a phone in which you can dial up the past (or at least six hours of the past), and the tragic results it has in three peoples' lives. Joe Tabbanella, Melissa Pursley and Jesse Harper are the ""stars""; their acting is credible, but whoever did their makeup should be shot. They always looked gray and their lipstick changed colors within the same shots? Anyway, while I commend the movie's originality, it's plot really is pretty incredulous and the ending is murky enough to be frustrating. Not horrible, but not good either."
4,Almost perfect,"Love the light, just right, the design is adorable but the design details need a little work. Still I recommend it."
1,Be Careful- Does not work with Humidifier shown,"This ad makes it look like it fits the humidifier pictured, but the filter is for a 1155 the humidifier pictured is a 1115. Of course I didn't notice that until it arrived and it did not fit. You can cut it to make it work, but it is hard to cut and there is a lot of waste. Amazon really flubbed this one, so be careful!"
1,Bait & Switch,"When you buy a humidifier, the ad says, people who bought this also bought, and a humidifier filter is shown. The problem is IT DOESN'T FIT THE UNIT YOU BOUGHT.The company denies responsiility because dimensions are listed (they aren't listed for the humidifier you just bought).You appeal to Amazon who denies your request and denies you the reason fir it's finding !"
4,Nice Filter,This filter worked well and was better than the original filter. It has some support pieces that keep it from sagging.
5,I couldn't put it down,"This is a beautifully told, extremely well-written story that brought old New Orleans to life with such clarity, it was as though I were walking down Bourbon Street every time I opened the book. I do agree the ending was a bit rushed but only because I didn't want the book to end. Kate and Julia, Mollie Q, Billy Shakespeare and all the characters were well-defined and believable. I have read Ms Battle before and will continue to read everything she writes. (And I don't understand the ""bodice-ripper"" review, either)!!"
5,VERY New Orleans,"I LOVED this book! I read it before I lived in New Orleans, and I still think of it now that I live here, whenever I pass the area that was once Storyville. A very fascinating period of time. I recommend E.J Bellocq's photos to take a look at these ladies lives at that time."
2,"I thought this book was an easy read, which kept my interest","My main problem with this novel was the ending. I felt the author ""rushed"" the ending and just wanted to finish writing the novel, opposed to taking the time to bring the characters in a full circle. If I had known how rushed the characters would be at the end of the book, I would have never started reading it. It was the conflict which each woman and the husband were facing in thier lives that kept me going. I was extremely disappointed in the last 50 pages"
1,Dud of a book,"How can you write a book about New Orleans in the Storyville years (early 20th Century) and make it boring? For an example, read Storyville by Lois Battle. There is almost no jazz or sex in the book (wow!) and the interesting parts are cribbed from Al Rose's excellent book on the subject. The author trots these across the page like cardboard cut-outs. I guess this passes for fiction these days, but in spite of my resolve to read the entire book, I felt it a waste of time."
5,Hookers & History,"This is a great book. Like many of the other reviewers, I could not put it down! An interesting story line about a young girl who inadvertently gets thrown into 'the life', is paralleled with the other story line about a society woman who campaigns for women's rights and works to shut down the Storyville district. This book is hardly a ""bodice ripper"". (Don't know where they got that!) The details of life in turn of the century (20th century) New Orleans are obviously well researched. The characters are well developed and this book really comes alive right from the start. A tale of poverty, prostitution, the ""haves and have nots"", tough Madams, jazz musicians, Creole families, long standing traditions, sufragettes, the Spanish-American War, and lots of sin and judgement. You get the idea... This is a good book for those interested in New Orleans, American history, or just great characters in an interesting environment. Highly recommended!"
1,A big disappointment,"This book has been on my 'list' for several years and I finally got around to reading it recently. I might have saved myself the time - both in anticipating it and reading it. I found none of the characters to be sympathetic. Instead they were all somehow - how is it possible to be both? - boring caricatures. It felt like reading a book that was being written while what the author really had in mind was a movie. The sex was gratuitous and the so-called action felt forced. Above all the author may or may not still live in the South, I'm not sure, but it seems odd that she found this bit of real history and place intriguing enough to write about and yet a true contempt for New Orleans and Southerners comes screaming through."
1,Carol Anthony's Guide to Carol Anthony,"Carol Anthony's Guide to the I Ching is the most misleading book I have read on this subject. Throughout her commentaries, she beats the same old drum: ""ego is bad"" and ""trust in the Cosmic Order."" It makes no difference which hexagram she is expounding upon. She begins with what she wants to talk about, and that's what she talks about. I am not saying that she is wrong in her observations, but I will say that there is not one single hexagram in the I Ching that concerns ego--not one! There is not one singe hexagram which states in its line structure that you should ""trust the Cosmic Order."" The hexagrams reflect prevailing circumstances, and the rest comes from us. Carol Anthony's book belongs with the self-help genre. It reflects, not the oracle, but her own ideals, biases, and agenda. It reflects her. This is a book of pure projection. I will not say it is without value, for some of her observations are helpful, but this book does not discuss the I Ching."
5,Indispensible companion to the I Ching,"This is a truly magnificent work written by a very wise lady. If you are at all interested in developing yourself using the Wilhelm\Baynes edition of the I Ching you will find this book indispensible. It is astoundingly insightful and must be regarded as a major achievement along with her other top book ""The Philosophy of the I Ching"". I read both of these daily. Many many thanks."
5,Looking for a great meditative Guide- Look no further!,Both my wife and my daughter have used this book for many years to sort out the confusion life often presents us with. I was curious about it and looked for another book that wouldn't be exactly the same as theirs. This one is the best!
3,Good for beginners,"I don't think this book is the right tool for someone who is taking on the study of the I Ching. The book ""interprets"" a bit too much for me. Every reading must take on it's own meaning for each situation, person, age, etc. Wilhelm's (book that opened this up to the world at large) while difficult to understand allows the querent the ability to ""see"" things for themselves. However, I will say that my dear friend would rate this book 5 stars. So, like many things with divination you must find the tools that work best for you."
5,This very positive attitude towards Divine life help is good.,"The most prominent idea I came away with from reading this version of the I Ching is 'not to give up on anyone'; remain open minded and accepting. One never knows when, but that the good will happen is reassuring."
3,good book on rope magic,"Abbott's Encyclopedia of Rope Tricks for Magicians is a good book serving a reference purpose. Its aspect and manner of coverage will not excite and inspire but there is a lot of useful material in the book. My feeling was the book could have been written more attractively and more efficiently from the viewpoint of the learner. However, a serious student of rope magic needs little more in a limited portion of rope magic. There does not seem to be clear coverage of modern knowhow that goes behind such contemporary routines as by Sands, Daryl, Sanders and Tabary. But this is perhaps for the obvious reason that the book was written long long ago. On the other hand there is much about knots, cut and restored techniques and body penetration."
1,Not a wipe clean surface: beware!,"I put this on my baby registry for my first born. After having her home from the hospital for a month, I became very unhappy with this changing pad. My baby had very loose stools (from a strictly breast milk diet) and she soiled this pad close to every changing. I kept having to wash the cover. My girl friend recommended to me another changing pad on the babiesrus website called the ""Contoured Changing Pad"" that has a permanent plastic cover on it (that allows for a wipe clean surface). I got one and found it to be worlds better than the E-Z pad. In fact I now have two of them, one for upstairs and one for down."
1,"Thanks, but NO Thanks!","I thought this would be okay for the changing table instead of buying a vinyl one and a cover too. WRONG! I felt like the cover to this thing was always in the wash! It was more of problem than a solution. And after washing several times a week it started to shrink, then I couldn't get the pads back in the darn cover. And speaking of the pads, I could never get the ODORS out of it. I ended up buying the other changing pad, and a nice pink terry cover. I still wash this new one once a week, but I only have to spray and wipe the pad!! Easy & clean!"
4,I loved this changing pad!,"I had this 7 years ago when my son was a baby, and now that I'm having another baby, I'm going to buy another one. We used this on top of a dresser instead of buying a changing table and it worked great! It was soft and comfortable for the baby. The cover was easy to take off and wash. It lasted for many years.Edited to add: I did buy this pad again and it's just as I remembered, except for one thing. The fabric on the back and sides is a thinner material than it was when I had it 7 years ago. Then, it was all terry cloth, and now it's a much thinner material. I would have preferred it if it was exactly the same as my first purchase, and it's still a really good pad, but because the material is thinner, I'm giving the pad 4 stars instead of 5."
3,I'm conflicted...,"I can't decide whether I've just sat through an historically significant film or a historically significant mistake. And the film I rented had NO commentary or extras, so I've had to read past reviews just to try to get a bit of the perspectives of others. Boy, is it ever LONG! And boy, was the event at the end surprising! In between, the hours dragged and opinions and questions about the non-existent plot became much more interesting than being caught up in the (non) action. Wish I could decide whether it deals with feminism or with nihilism of some sort. I hadn't known of the actress before, but she was RIGHT for the part, and so was the actor who did the son, and, indeed, the others too.Believe I'll never be able to eat meatloaf again!"
5,great source of information regarding ww 2 refugees,"excellently written, very informative. explains the isolationist attitude in America, and the angst suffered by the refugees and the brave people who supported their immigration."
5,Another Ruth Gruber page turner,"A fascinating tale of Holcaust refugees, begrudgingly admitted to the U.S., and their struggle to stay here. Another indictment of Britain and America's cold-hearted failure to allow as many Jews as possible to immigrant to their shores. The shame of this failure will forever stain our countries, not to mention the loss of all that Jewish productivity, brain-power, and artistic ability.srice922@hal-pc.org"
5,Heartwarming story,"Ruth gurner is a wonderfully dedicated human being to those refugees, she put her heart and soul into their safety! Impressive!"
5,An opportunity to live our lives with meaning,Ruth Grubers writing is enthralling. Our opportunity is to apply the life lessons to our lives. She provides us truths that hold today.
5,An incredible story,"Ms Gruber was a woman ahead of her time in many ways. Other reviewers say maybe an exception shouldn't have been made in letting the refugees stay. Me? I'm embarrassed that my country did so little to help those in need. We knew what was going on and did nothing. Would it have been different if they weren't Jews? Probably.But about the book itself, I found her a very good writer. The books was interesting and informative. Of course, it was from her point of view, but I found her storytelling compelling. And as of April 2011 she is still alive!"
4,Photo request Email Correction,"My apology,Please send requests for photos to NorthGuy13126@aol.com.Thanx.- Joe C."
5,Haven,"This is a little known and fascinating story about WWII refugees who were allowed into the US outside the ""quota"". Outside our history books, but something we should all be aware of it only adds to the many (19 ?) equally interesting and historical books written by Ruth Gerber.Anyone who does not know who she is or has not read any of her writings would do well to make a point of learning. This woman who will be 100yrs old in September 2011 has lead a life beyond what most of us could hope to aspire to. She is a readable author who has been fortunate enough to ""be there"" when things of ""import"" were happening and had/has the talent to write about it. This is just one of the many chapters in a life well lived."
2,Too small,Item was of good quality but much too small for my taste. I think more size description should be given.
4,Worth it...,"I heard a song by the Mary Janes on a non-commercial radio station and had to buy the CD. The first time I listened to this, I was a little disappointed but after listening to it a few more times, this CD has become an important part of my collection. ""Never Felt Better"" never fails to make me feel better and ""Wish I Could Fly"" is just as good. I would say tracks 1-7 are totally worth it. The Mary Janes songs on this album are really beautiful and peaceful."
4,Alfie Bucks the System,"I found the book,Beyond Discipline, to be very insightful. Yes Alfie Kohn criticizes all other methods but I think hearing the criticisms helps one to understand the constructive points that follow. I feel his criticisms are intended to make educators evaluate the accepted methods of discipline from a different viewpoint - that of the children."
2,Many Questions Left Unanswered,"Alfie Kohn's unique perspective on building community in the classroom sounds provocative, but really it's a plan that won't work in today's schools. Kohn seems to feel that much of the control in the classroom should be with the students, but how can this work when most children can't handle this power Kohn wants them to have? The book leaves many questions unanswered, and the ""ten most frequently asked qusetions"" near the end doesn't cut it. Kohn's repeated criticism of more assertive discipline methods gets old quickly, and perhaps he should've spent more time defining his own method instead of tearing apart other peoples' work. Sure, giving students more freedom and building community is a goal in education, but this book's ideas aren't the answer."
3,The behaviorist that dogs behavior,"This book is well written, but he dogs many of the reinforcements teachers used calling them ""punishments"". He doesn't explain intrinsic and extrinsic rewards can be helpful, not just punishments."
2,Book review,"I agree with other reviews here. The book spends alot of paper criticizing traditional education methods. Also, the book is wordy. Glance over the first five to six chapters and only read the second half of the book."
2,"Anecdotes galore, but no beef","Don't get me wrong. The book was relatively easy to read. BUT ALFIE HAS NO CREDENTIALS IN THIS FIELD! He has never been a teacher. He has no educational certification. He's an arm-chair general telling you what he thinks is wrong with education, and there's plenty wrong. Unfortunately, without that background in the field, his arguments and positions are extreme. It's an unreasoned ""throw the baby out"" approach similar to his anti-testing rhetoric that complains, but does not suggest viable, reasoned alternatives. I know where the holes are -- the dam in full of them. Give me reasoned solutions please! If that's what you're looking for, don't buy this book or any of Alfie's material."
4,book review,"I am reading this book for a graduate course. So far, I am enjoying it. It is well organized and follows a logical progression."
4,Beyond Discipline,"This book will challenge you to examine your pre-conceived ideas about students and classroom management. It is a ""must read"" for all involved with education."
3,Tedious to get through the first half,"Kohn may have valid points about the need for more student-centered and democratic practices in the classroom, but it takes him entirely too long to get there. The first half of the book just criticizes every ""traditional"" classroom management program, without offering any potential solutions. It's a frustrating book to read, not so much because of what Kohn has to say, but how he says it."
3,Code Doesn't Work,The author is obviously skilled at explaining the concepts involved with C++ database programming but I was upset to find that the example code did not work. I even copied it from the CD that came with the book and recompiled; it compiles without errors but still it doesn't work.
1,Don`t waste your money,"The book tries to teach you database programming by making a program with several features, but you know what? After day 3 the code is no good! . The book might be good to lear a little sql, but its no good for visual c++ database programming... Has no support for their no good code."
5,Great Introduction to Database Programming,"If you're reasonably experienced with C++ (in the Windows realm) but lacking in knowledge of the latest Microsoft database technologies, this is a terrific book to buy. I found the examples to be helpful, and the way the book is written makes it seem like you have a Guru right over your shoulder helping you along.I strongly disagree with the negative reviews presented on this book; I found the text to be accurate and informative and the text covered a variety of useful topics. Those who had trouble getting the demonstrations to work properly may want to brush up on their basics* a bit, although this book doesn't require overly extensive knowledge of MFC.* (Such as actually stepping through the code to see that the problem was your fault.)"
5,Nice book for C++ programmers,"This is a very nice book for C++ database programming. The contents in Day 1 is especially useful for us. As many C++ programmer tend to reinvent their own database (wheel), the day 1's subject is very important. The rest of the book is also well written and very practical.I recommend this book because if a C++ programmer mastered database technology, he may increase his income by 50 to 100 percent. Don't let VB programmers with database knowledge alone make 5 figures income, while you, an experienced C++ programmer, works much harder and make much less money. Buying this book is the new start of your career."
3,Different,"The style of writing and the stories themselves aredifferent from anything I have ever read. Imagery isstrong...to a fault for my taste...in The CatherineTrilogy. In the others, I sometimes felt burdened by it.Different is not all bad, however, and actually offersmuch needed contrast to what is available in lesbian fiction."
3,Probably not what you expect...,"I am a big fan of Clancy fiction, but this is the first nonfiction of his that I have read. While really only glancing at the cover before reading it, I incorrectly assumed a book about special forces training and combat. That turns out to be a small part of what this book really is. It is a mini-biography of Carl Stiner (a true American hero), a development history of special forces, and examples of American combat from WWII to the the Gulf War.This is a book that every soldier and sailor should read, because it really explains how winning is so much more than just fighting with weapons. Winners need to fight with psychology, civil affairs, training others, etc. But while every soldier and sailor may benefit, it is not quite exciting for the average reader. I read this on the heels of Blackhawk Down, which is infinitely more electrifying, but understandably a different type of book. Shadow Warriors is really almost a text book, and a good one, for some."
2,Not what I wanted,"I don't pretend to know much about U.S. Special Forces...precisely the reason I purchased this book. Having now read it, I continue to feel I know very little about this subject. While I've never been a Clancy fan and have the utmost respect for General Stiner and his work and sacrifices for our country and its foreign ""relations,"" I walked away from this book feeling like the title was very much a misnomer. While the stories in the book are interesting in and of themselves, they failed to paint any cognizable picture of Special Forces operations I might have hoped to gain.For any novice, like myself, interested in learning about the Special Forces (i.e. all the U.S.'s Special Forces) I would recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Clancy Clunker,"I have never offered a review before, but this book was such a waste of money that I felt compelled to. Unfortunately, without the tragic events of 9/11, this book would probably never have made a dime for Clancy. It is his clumsiest attempt ever at cobbling together an old story with a weak pretext for being fresh information. Aside from the fact that the narrative itself is about as boring as a high school history text; Clancy can't seem to decide whether he wants to actually tell the story of Special Ops Forces, or offer a platform for a dry and uninspiring autobiography of Carl Stiner. The reader is repeatedly assaulted with poorly camouflaged whining about the ""big"" Army mistreatment and misunderstanding of SF. The final insult is a meandering, condescending, and completely irrelevant lecture on leadership from Stiner that he has no doubt bored several ROTC classes with over the years. Save your money - this is Clancy at his commercial worst!"
1,"Blah, blah, blah","I've read most of Clancy's novels and a few of his non-fiction works. This was by far the most disappointing. If you are interested in military history -- not military history as in battles and great campaigns -- but in the constant infighting and bureaucratic scheming that inevitably occurs, then this book is for you. The accounts of combat are sparse and most of them I've seen before in other places. Actual facts about Special Forces techniques, training, equipment, roles, and missions are not real prominent in this book which makes you wonder why it's even worth the time. Clancy must have needed a new house or something and decided to clear out his files. While I'm sure the military men that were involved with this book are all great guys, you'd have to draft me and order me to read this book, if I were to read it again."
2,Three's a crowd,"First of all, anytime a book has three authors you're asking for trouble. This book lists (in descending font height) Tom Clancy, Gen. Carl Stiner, and barely visible on the cover, Tony Koltz. My guess is Tony did the heavy lifting on this book. In fact, I don't believe for a minute Tom Clancy did anything but dress up in his ridiculous pseudo-miltary uniform for the back picture.Stiner seems like a good guy in this book, and some of the stories are good. But it's also completely disjointed, disorganized, and in some spots, hopelessly confusing."
3,Not Tom's best,"Some of the events mentioned in the book were not detailed enough for the reader to reach to the same conclusions that the author did. Maybe because I know these events and I some what disagree with him. But I can't talk on behalf of the people that are not aware of these events.I would like to stress that I did not rate 3 stars because I disagree with the author, a lot of other topics I think that he was spot on and could not agree more with him. The reason I gave him 3 because The author lost my attention in the middle of the book and because it is not TOM's best work."
1,Shadow Warriors,"This is the most disappointing book I have ever read. Especially coming from an author whose name just happens to be on the cover, as that is the only Clancy I can find in this book."
2,History in the making,It seems more like a history lesson than a action book. If you are in the history of the Special Forces this is your book.
2,Shadow Warriors,Very slow. Not the normal exciting novel by Clancy. More of a history or philosophy book.
1,Boring!,"I labored through about half of this book, anticipating that it would begin to relate in some way to its title. The first part about the origin of SF was interesting. But it went downhill once it commenced with the biography of a former Green Beret without any special ops combat experience, and with only a very short time spent in that community. Stiner's command experience in the spec-ops world seems overstated in this book. None of the other numerous historical books I've read on spec-ops - many by the operators themselves - ever mention Stiner. Clancy seems to know what a good story is, but somehow completely missed it on this one."
2,A little something,"When I first opened this book I really didn't know what to expect. I've read many other Tom Clancy fiction and non-fiction books and have enjoyed them.This book felt like a clutter reading it. It didn't seem organized and just seemed a bit half-done. I was fairly disappointed on how it was written but still all the information was useful and left me a bit satisfied.This book isn't for someone who wants to be introduced to America's Special Forces unit and what they do and their nature, but this book is for people who already have and enjoy a knowing knowledge of America's military.The contents are very accurate historically of course as most non-fiction books, but this definitely shows a raw side of SF in which msot books don't show; that not all missions have the greatest outcome.This book can be read with some satisfaction to some, but it is not one that I would come and recommend much about."
3,Very in-depth and detailed,"I enjoyed this book, but I'm not so sure I would recommend it to the casual reader. Clancy gets very detailed in the book and, at times, too much emphasis is placed on hammering out every little detail at the sacrifice of easy and interesting reading.""Shadow Warriors"" gives a good in-depth look at US Special Forces and the career of retired General Carl Stiner.Recommended for those who really want to get deep inside the Special Forces (probably deeper than you really want to go). Not recommended if you're looking for light reading and edge-of-the-seat page-turning."
2,Shadow Warriors,"The book was a major disappointment. Shadow Warriors was promoted as an explantion and description of special forces. This is a subject that is especially relevant today. Sadly, the book was narrow, shallow, unfocused, and did not begin to explain special forces when it obviously could have. I guess Clancy's well earned reputation for excellent books allowed him to get a clunker past the editors.Los Altos, CA"
1,"Verbose, Boring and Inaccurate","Mr. Clancy has written a verbose book which is also boring and would have been better served as being a 3 page magazine article.He has also made a false bald-faced inaccurate statement where he say's on P.76, (there being no atheists in foxholes). This statement has no validity and Atheists should receive an apologyfrom Mr. Clancy."
2,"Interesting read, but misleading title","This book is an odd mix of fascinating stories, boring detail about some irrelevent off-subject matter, and lots of other stuff piled into one. I'm not sure whether to recommend it or not because there were some geniunely exciting stories related here, but also a lot of junk that casual readers would want to skim over. Probably the worst part is that it's title is misleading, this book is not dedicated to special forces. It's more about what Carl Stiner did during his military career."
1,Clancy clunker,This book is a total lack of time. Clancy has no military background and it shows. He should stick to his make believe fictions. I live in the same town as Stiner and the General in the book is not the one we all know. I suggest you buy anything but this boring account of someones imagination.
3,Not as interesting and exciting as I thought it would be...,"I am a great fan of Tom Clancy fiction, and this book was my first read of his nonfiction series. I agree with many of the less glowing reviews previously on this book - its really more a biography of General Stiner and his administrative and command decisions throughout the years. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting a more thrilling look into the evolution of the various Special Forces specifically."
1,This book is a joke!,The book is boring. Stiner is a joke. Clancy is a joke. Clancy has no military background so why is it that he writes so much about the military? Get a life Clancy. We don't want to read boring stories about pencil pushers like Stiner.
2,At least I can use the parts for something else,"As a traction device, this thing is worse than worthless. It's uncomfortable, difficult to use, and at least for me, had zero effect. I didn't have high hopes when I bought it, but I didn't think that I would only have a half-inch of velcro trying to hold the thing together on my head. I didn't think that moving the slightest amount would cause something on it to come unhooked almost every time. I didn't think that it would require such a ridiculous balancing act of trying to keep enough tension on the sling so it doesn't pop off the crossbar while trying to lower the weight. I didn't think the rope would be so slick as to have to double-knot it to keep it from slipping.The only reason I can give it any stars at all is because at least the pullies and door-hanger are mildly useful for other purposes."
4,Not a doctor...,"I had one of these for several years, the harness finally fell apart and the water bag tore at the opening so I had to replace it.The unit I received had short hook & loop strips that caused me to be choked by the harness. I had some dual sided hook & loop strips and cut lengths to extend the manufacturers straps. That problem was solved.My doctor told me, when prescribing the first unit, to use as much weight as I felt comfortable using. I fill the bag to the full 20 pound amount. I was also instructed to make sure I sat for at least 20 minutes when performing traction as it takes that long for the muscles to relax and the traction to really do any good. As with any medical device (regardless of how benign it might seem) be careful, you don't want to make things worse."
2,Utterly Useless,"I have used several Traction Devices over the past ten years, but thisMickey Mouse Kit isn't anywhere near ""as advertised"". I feel very ripped off."
5,We love these,We love these particular Altoids but obviously we are not among the majority because it is hard to find them over the counter in stores or supermarkets.
5,Wonderful find,I had been looking everywhere here in WV for Altoid Licorice. I couldnot be found. I love it. I am so happy I know where I can get it now.
1,Bad change in taste,"Altoids Mints, Liquorice, 1.76-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)The composition of the mint has changed the taste completely. The factory must have mixed the wrong ingrediants. The numbers on the tins are as follows: L210409 110M3. This is from the 4 packs of 12 I bought.They taste like a mixture of Ginger and Liquorice and leave a horrible after taste."
5,My wife LOVES them!!!,I buy these for my wife every year. She loves the Liquorice Altoids the best. The price is right and the free shipping with the minimum purchase works out perfectly.
5,"Good stuff, but does not taste like real liquorice.","Being from Denmark where we can get liquorice in all sorts, I guess I know how that tastes... And this is not the taste of real liquorice, it taste of something candy we had when I was a kid and exactly like the dutch salmiak 'Lakrisal' drop, if you can get hold of that thing BUY RIGHT AWAY... But bottom line, the altoids taste incredibly good, but it's definitely not liquorice... Besides that and my childhood good taste I give it 5***** thanks..."
4,STRONG Liquorice,"Wow - hard to find except on Amazon. Wonderful liquorice flavor, but awfully strong....stronger than I remember. Too bad they can't tone them down just a notch."
4,Great tasting breath freshener...,"But it didn't help me get the girl.Sent as gift. She loved them, but not the fact I would spend more on the shipping than on the candies. Oh, well.Otherwise, great. Delivered as promised"
4,Altoids,These are really strong licorice mints. You must be a fan of licorice to enjoy them--which I do.
4,I like liquorice Altoids,"I have been a long time fan of liquorice both red and black. But it's hard to keep traditional liquorice on hand and not go stale. Altoids, gives me the flavor I like and the long lasting mint in a great storage container."
5,liquorice,"If you like liquorice, you'll LOVE thses!!! I found them here in my town once and bought only a couple. Was I wrong doing that!!! I couldn't find anymore anywhere!!! Then I found this site and YURICKA I found them and ordered a case!!"
3,Liquorice ALtoids,"These are very spicy, a bit moreso than I expected. I recommend them to those who REALLY LIKE liquorice...strong flavor."
5,Altoids Licorice ROCKS,"I have loved the ""curiously strong"" taste of Altiods mints since I first discovered them. As a Licorice lover, they just plain GOT IT RIGHT"
5,Liquorice mmmm liquorice,"No mint, pure liquorice (or licorice in the US). I you love liquorice, this is the most powerful version you are likely to encounter. Like their ""curiously strong"" mints, these are ""curiously strong"" liquorice. (the only problem I have is what to do with all the empty tins that I've collected.)"
4,Secret Americana,"I picked this disc up while panning for something good in a 10 cd's for $10 deal at Big Star Records in Australia. And by Jove I found gold! As my good, good friend Owen Jamieson often reminds me, ""You've got to speculate to accumulate,"" and in this instance I have most certainly accumulated something of quality.If you like Americana: Felice Brothers, Bon Iver, Dylan, Barzin, Richmond Fontaine, Lancaster Orchestra, Langhorne Slim, Norfolk and Western et al this will be a valuable [secret] addition to your collection. It's going dead cheap on Amazon and, to be honest, if it cost me thrice the price, I'd snap it up - especially if I could find it on vinyl.The vocals are slightly endearingly unglossed. There are the usual instruments that you might expect from an album of quiet indie-American: guitar, bass and drums with inflections of banjo, harmonica, slide guitar and b-vox.This album is a real treat of understated, back-porch perfection."
1,The millionth Grand Theft Auto clone!,"In Grand Theft Auto clone number one million, you control some gangster guy named Nick Kong who has a love for gorillas (hence his last name, Kong!). Mr. Kong steals cars. He shoots people. Nick Kong also does missions, and steals many ideas from the Grand Theft Auto series. In fact, if GTA was never around, this wouldent be either! Thats how much of a creative game it is! I would reccomend Grand Theft Auto clone number one million to people who liked Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City, and San Andreas and wanted to play a watered down version of those games. Happy playing."
5,A go to starter for any Sociologist dealing with Korea,"This is a great book! Written by a Sociologist at a University right next to one of the largest Korean immigrant communities in the world, it provides very insightful writings on the Korean experience in America. Lots of things can also be applied to other East Asian families who migrate to NY. Provides a great explanations for how Korean groups form, and also the reasoning and purpose for certain activities for new immigrants (like forming church groups) and how this results. A quick read, but very informative. Also gets into gender role change, so definitely a great book to read if studying gender of East Asian families in general"
4,works great,This skirt will fit your 10' pelican. The elastic will need to be tightened and fitted to the kayak's lip. You may need a buddy to help you stretch the band to ensure a snug fit. It works great and keeps me dry!
2,Skip it.,"I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed ""Marxist-Art Historian"" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France."
4,Decent book for the price,"I recently purchased this book A) Because it was alot cheaper than my college bookstore's price, and B) Because it was mandatory for the class I'm taking. The book covers alot of the information for the 1800s in the art world. I like to actually see the work of art when it's being discussed, so the lack of images is a little annoying."
4,Used at Yale...,"This is the textbook used in Yale's introductory course to 19th century French art, and is considered to be the industry standard for surveying the period."
1,Shoot me please,"You know a book is going to be mind numbing when the author praises their book above all others for about 4 pages. I understand that this is a college level book but it didn't need to use so much jargon. The paragraphs are almost impossible to decipher on the first, second, or even third read. The author obviously had to use ambigious language to make himself seem more academic. When explaining the works of Goya they devote an entire chapter to him. Pages upon pages which in reality could have been truncated down to perhaps 3 or 4. The pictures are on one page and the explanation of the pictures can be PAGES away. Making studying extremely difficult. My classmates and I believe that the true answers are in some other book, or perhaps you need a black light to find them. This book is like punishment from God."
1,the HORROR 57 bucks can buy you!!,"If you want to read one of THE dullest, stuffiest, not to mention stylistically ghastly books in all of art history, please read this one. These writers confuse ambiguity and meanlingless hodgepodge for intelligence."
2,"A conclusion based on speculation, not fact.","The mystery at Rennes-le-Chateau has facinated me ever since I read The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. I was hoping that Tomb of God would expand on the mystery and perhaps answer some of the questions that I had. It is unfortunate my money was wasted. The geometry lesson left me baffled, especially the conclusion that was drawn from it. Speculation should never lead to conclusion. Unfortunatly the authors have ignored this basic tenet and left this question hanging; if you have the proof, why don't you go and get it? Without the physical evidence, the ""2000 year old mystery"" has no solution. This book will collect dust on my shelf as it is not worth re-reading."
3,"Something there, but...","While I do not deny that there is some secret meaning hidden in the paintings of Pousin and Teniers and the Templar map of Jerusalem the authors present, I believe that they have jumped over a premise or two to arrive at their conclusion that this secret relates to the body of Christ. However, it is also true that anyone with a straight edge and a map of the area in question can confirm for themselves the obvious relationship that Cardou has to many of the ancient structures around. On the whole, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject, so long as the reader closely examines the arguments the authors make."
3,Quasi-enjoyable Pseudo-History,"Firstly, THE TOMB OF GOD is not woth near $20. I got it for $5 through a newspaper-style catalog of surplus books. It was worth that much.THE TOMB OF GOD is pseudohistory. It distorts how things happened, pulls connections out of almost nothing, and is at times anti-Catholic (at least not as rabid as Lincoln's wider anti-Christian bigotry). Also unlike Lincoln's work (Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Messianic Legacy) it is not as enjoyable.The Tomb of God (or, as the authors claim it was once pronounced, CARDOU) is stuck in geometry. You have to skip pages at a time to avoid being bogged down reading passage after passage about the importance of 1 + 1/2 degress.Playing the game ""Gabriel Knight 3"" was what got me interested into this genre, and I don't regret it. If you read it as pretend, like the World Weekly News or In Search Of, it's a pretty fun book. If you're looking for the truth stear clear."
3,Lines of fact?,"The book draws arbitrary ""facts"" from lines drawn arbitrarily on paintings, but, dismisses myths and legends as baseless and foolish, all with an air of scholarly authority.In short I found that the authors own comments on how they brushed aside other views (like Lincoln's) equally applicable to their own fickle choices.The study of art, the research into France, language and cartography certainly make the book enjoyable and enlightening.The theories presented didnt surprise me any and they did not appear as original, only the location and the mechanism to ""define"" the location did.All in all, its a book that I read cover to cover and spent many hours pondering despite my complaints with it."
3,Good but Deep,"I,ve read many books on the subject and have found all of them interesting! however this book takes the subject from a slightly new perspective that once again forces one to ask more about what we are taught in our lives"
1,Pseudo-History at Best,"Andrews and Schellenberger have written a fascinating detective novel, but, unfortunately, they are attempting to pass it off as history and religion. Weaving historical facts with conjecture and intrigue, they argue a theory which suggests that the shadowy Knights Templar discovered the body of Jesus under the ruins of the Herodian temple in Jerusalem. They then spirited it away to a mountain in France where it is now buried. How convenient that the authors were unable to dig on the conjectured site! I am very sorry to see books like this because they blur the line between history and fantasy so powerfully as to confuse and deaden the mind. I am all for enlightenment and the liberation of knowledge from those academics who feel that intellectual prowess is their private kingdom. But silliness like this is not the answer."
4,the exact explanation about rennes le chateau,"i have to say that i red a lot of things about this magical place in France, and only this book gave me a close idea of all the history and true about jesus and the holy grial.awesome investigation about paints and placesa good point about sauniere's moneyexcelent sacred geometry/ geography ( i hope you understand what i'm talking about)"
2,"Heavily padded, but some good basics","Rather tedious reading because of so much obvious padding to get the page count up to 500... I would estimate that there are 200 pages of real content here. There is a long explanation of what actions the trigger on a gun initiate, in order to be sure we understand what an Oracle ""Trigger"" is through a long analogy. This is a typical example of where a text is padded out to a paragraph to explain a concept that could have been done in a sentence. Authors should respect the reader's time and attention. Some of the coverage is very thin and the seams show on the revision for the 9i. We I reviewed the book and noted the highlighted passages, I realized how thin in content this actually was.Still a good first read for a new DBA, but the Wessler or Dawes or even Ault are better, more detailed and ultimately more useful."
1,Not for beginners,"As a programmer with experience in MS SQL Serer, this book appealed as a first introduction to Oracle. Unfortunately, too much space has been dedicated to complicated and unnecessary detail. For example, early chapters go to great detail of setting up the SQL Plus utility, interesting, but frequently I found myself skipping page after page that I didn't need as a beginner and there's no way I would remember. As a beginners' book, it's disappointing to find installation of the database pushed all the way back to chapter 7, and with that the chapter starts by saying that a full coverage of installations is beyond the scope of this book! If installing the database is not important for beginners, what is? Final word, this book isn't for beginners."
4,Can't find them? I know where you can !!,"I looked for these things on the internet everywhere. Out Of Stock, Out Of Stock!! Well, luckily I found ToyMagnets.com. IT WAS GREAT! They have many to choose from AND ALL IN STOCK!!! Pretty decent prices too. I ordered mine at 7:00 and it went out in shipment at 9:00. Check It Out!!"
2,Not for beginners !,"The whole DVD consists of 6 chapters where they go over key points in IMPROVING your breaststroke technique.There are several basic drills they present to improve common breaststroke mistakes and/or bad habits.Namely the points are: eyes down under, eyes down above, reach full extension, finish your kick, use a mini pull, send it forward.I will probably be able to use some of it but as a beginner who is struggling to get the basics of the pull and catch I resented the lack of a short description of the basic movements. Also the price does not make any economic sense: 39 dollars for a DVD? It only reduces the number of consumers and provides incentives to piracy."
3,Better Than I Expected,"Pumpkinhead: Ashes To Ashes is the third in the Pumpkinhead series, and while it's not great, I don't understand why it got the bad reviews that it did. I think it's a pretty good tribute to the original, bringing Lance Henrickson back. Also, there is some good gore, with throat slashings and an impalement. The first half of the movie is better than the second half, though. The first half is pretty much non-stop action, but things slip a bit in the second half. It's too bad, too, because if the final half of the film would have kept the momentum going I would've given it a four star rating. But three stars isn't bad for the third in a b-movie series, I guess."
1,Embarrassing!,"Obviously Lance Henriksen did it for the money; he hardly appears at all in this second pathetic sequel to a genuinely frightening original. The special effects are so bad in this movie there is actually a scene in which a pumpkinhead doll is sitting in a church window, completely unmoving--this supposedly representing a satanically vicious monster capable of killing anything in its path. Frankly, my brother and I made home movies with 'special effects' like that when we were 12! The only saving grace is Doug Bradley's performance and Lance's cameos, and neither of those is sufficent to merit your time or consideration. Okay, if you have OCD and HAVE to watch or own all of the Pumkinhead movies, go right ahead. Otherwise, your life is better spent cleaning your belly button. Slowly."
3,Let's lay ole pumpkinhead to rest for good.,"The second Pumpkinhead was a shocker (and not in a good way), this one however wasn't too bad. As the second one had nothing to do with the first Pumpkinhead, this one was a follow on, although set some 10 years or so later. Because it was similar to the first I didn't mind it and will probably watch it again in the not too distant future."
5,very pleased,Thanks so much you made my dad very pleased to have this movie again. Timed perfect for halloween. Its been years since it was given away and i got to right this wrong. thank you.
5,Great remake!,"I bought this movie hoping it was going to be good one, but it was better than I thought. The characters were believable, and the story line was good.Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes"
4,A Gene Gem,"Gene Clark was a superb, terribly underrated American songster, and this is as good as any instance of his other, somewhat more well-known work. The only songs or performances to compare to these are on ""The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard and Clark."" On this still more personally styled collection of songs, Gene Clark explored the quests of his generation, (""The Virgin"") ... Or examined his own life's work as an artist and creator, as in a piece of particular beauty,""Spanish Guitar"" -the only song I've ever heard Bob Dylan say he wished he had written. Not even collaborators like Robbie Robertson ever received such praise from Bob. As always, Gene's romanticism (""With Tomorow"") and full-hearted writing are moving throughout. Gene was an American treasure, and it's a shame that he wasn't better recognized here during his life. This is one prime example of his work - sweet and understated."
1,Be warned...,"OK, so I didn't read the ""fine print"". I ordered this DVD for my English class. When it arrived, I was distressed to see in fine print across the case, ""Greek with English subtitles"". My tenth graders were good sports about it, but the subtitles were small on my classroom's 25 inch screen. Just an FYI..."
1,Not Beneficial!!!!!,"If I had known that the movie was not in English, I would not have purchased it. How could a movie not spoken in English be beneficial to English speaking students? Not! Waste of money and time."
5,A Must See for All Ages,"I usually don't like modern dress in such productions, but its excellence surmounted any complaint. Best of all was the Emperor - I still go to sleep laughing whenever I think of him."
1,Overseas Videos,"The video DVD sent to me was for area 1 only. I think for playing in England, USA and Canada.As I am in Australia (Area 4), it was of no use to me. Most DVDs purchased from AMAZON ars only for Area 1"
1,Can't see it,I tried to stop this coming when I realised it will not play in Australia. I could not stop it and have to return it when the next one arrives
3,Good Production but lousy video quality,"I really liked the production, fun and very entertaining.But, sad to say, the video quality was really bad.Plus you have to be aware that that it is a region 1 DVD, which could give you some problems if you haven't got a region-free DVD-player (I'm in Europe)"
3,Flappers in Titipu,"While this production was interestingly staged and seriously fun to watch, (it takes Eric Idle to remind us that ""Oh bother the flowers of spring"" is a euphemism for ""Oh buggar the flowers...""), I suspect I am just too much of a purist to be wholly comfortable with this ""Mikado"". When I visit Titipu Japan, I expect to see a chorus of samurai at the beginning, rather than a group of seedy-looking Englishmen Making creepy ""slant-eye"" gestures at the audience, and people who look more like they belong to P.G.Wodehouse's universe than Gilbert & Sullivan's. Did I like it? In itself, it was a typically fresh-faced Jonathan Miller opera production, of the same quality he bestowed on Mozart opera some years ago. But then, this is not Mozart, and Japan doesn't cut it looking like the Miami hotel in the Marx Brothers' classic, ""Coconuts"". Take me back to old Japan - please."
4,Great fun,"Eric Idle gets away with it as you'd expect in a very enjoyable performance, really perfectly cast. Great set, gorgeous costumes, hideous makeup, rather over lit in the beginning. Saucy, campy dancing. All singers in excellent form obviously enjoying themselves and it's infectious. Lots of fun. The Mikado sparkles with the cleverest lyrics, I've got a little list is smartly contemporized, and the most effervescent music."
1,Please....spare me,"Not good; somebody's idea of an ""improvement and updating"" of Gilbert & Sullivan. Guess what? They don't need improving!! Get orginal versions from D'Orly Carte Company or Opera Australia.Eric Idle WAS great in Monty Python's Flying Circus, and should have rested on his laurels for the rest of his career."
1,Warning! Not closed-captioned!,The DVD that I ordered was not closed-captioned as it says in the format description. I give it one star only for this reason having not watched it as a result.
2,poor audio,"I am sure it is a great performance, but the audio recording was really poor, turning up the volume did not help, the words were still unintelligible"
5,"Gilbert & Sullivan - The Mikado / Eric Idle, Lesley Garrett, Richard Van Allan, Felicity Palmer, Richard Angas, Bonaventura Bott","An absolutely brilliant ""modern"" version of the Mikardo - sung very well and an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours."
2,didn't work for me,"They would not fit in my tool box drawer. Drawer needs to be 39 cm deep and 5 cm high. There was no clear, easy way to attach them to the drawer - no mounting holes. I wound up making my own by cutting grooves in a plywood block with a table saw. This resulted in more compact storage. Return: Customer pays return shipping. 20% restocking fee."
3,Made In China,"These struts are ""Made in China"". Had trouble with lower mount being tight and not fitting the spindle. They also do not have the same contour as the original, so if you try to trace where the originals are positioned and put these in a close to same position it is not easy to do."
1,Do not buy this version,"These are great songs. Toots is great, but this particular CD mix sounds as if the staff at House of Reggae records (the label for this issue) just held a dictahpone recorder up to some speakers while the master tapes were playing and then transfered that to CD. A lot of reggae bands get this treatment from indie labels, and you feel bad for the bands because good quality mixes are out there. A band gets a bad deal from rough-sounding mixes. They tend to make the band sound cheap and inferior, and Toots and the Maytals especially suffers when their clean, slick vocals sound as if they were recorded in a metal cage. Stick to a reputable label. Don't buy this version."
2,Another Unreliable Pressing,"This album contains a few classic Toots and the Maytals songs, ""Monkey Man,"" ""Sweet and Dandy,"" ""Pressure Drop,"" etc. But the quality of this pressing is so bad, you'd be better off skipping it. It's the same situation with most the early Bob Marley/Wailers recordings: Those early recordings are licensed out to just about anyone, and for the most part, the quality is garbage. The only reliable recordings I have found of Toots and the Maytals (and early Bob Marley/Wailers) are those which appear on Island Records (e.g., IN MEMPHIS, JUST LIKE THAT) and Trojan (e.g., IN THE DARK), Island Records being the highest quality. It's unfortunate that the majority of the Maytals cds presently available are low-quality pressings---and this pressing of MONKEY MAN is one of them. Stay clear."
2,"MySpace ""Hacking""","This may be a good book for younger people who are EXTREMELY computer savvy. As a fairly computer savvy ""senior citizen"", I thought this item would be easy for me to follow. Sorry, I finally gave the book to a teen-ager who loved it! This manual is more technical than the average person can follow."
2,Outdated Rubbish,"If I was to sum this whole book up into three words, it would be -- Boring and Dull. This book was not at all what I expected. It showed how to create really dull myspace pages and example links that weren't even existing anymore. This is a bland book, nothing to be excited about like I was. I wanted something to show me how to create spectacular band myspace sites, this book only covers the very basics of myspace code, and doesn't even know where it is going. i don't recommend this book unless you don't mind disappointments."
2,Hacking My Space,"This one is for the geeks. The most helpful thing about it was about 15 pages into it, it states if you do not understand all this computer language go look at all the sites online that will help you ""Pimp your site"" or my pace editors that makes life a lot easier. The other thing in the book is that it teaches you how to get the advertisements from these other sites off yours. I am not sure if the price it was worth it for that..but it did help."
3,First Experiment Doesn't Work,Bought this for niece & she is so excited. Tried to do Sunset experiment but the citric acid didn't turn red as it was supposed to. Still have high hopes for other experiments.
1,MADE IN CHINA,"I only ordered this as my search criteria in Amazon showed that it was ""made in the USA"" and it is not. I will be returning it."
4,Science Experiment Kit,"Not too bad. Got it as a gift for my neice and she really enjoyed it. A parent should help the kid with the experiments, it can get messy. The color changing experiment did not work for some reason."
4,My 5 year old daughter really enjoyed this! It was magical for her!,"This kit is great for kids who are 5 years old. Even though it is the simplest things, it is magical to them."
4,Great Toy for a 6 Yr Old Boy,We've only done a few experiments so far but they've worked as expected and have been a lot of fun to do together.
4,Great fun for an 8 year old,"We gave this to our 8 year old for Christmas, she opened that day and spent 2 hour having a lot of fun. She then took it back out every day for the next 3 days, repeating experiments and just playng with the supplies and creatng her own experiments. She was able to do it all on her own and was surpsied by the experiments and was learning along the way."
2,Not educational,"My wife and I bought this for our inquisitive 5 year old son and his 3 year old brother. My older one has taken a once a week 'science class' so he was familiar with basic scientific principles, as much as a 5 year old could be, but after one or two experiments which in reality all seem the same he quickly lost interest.Not worth it and we were disappointed based on the nice reviews."
2,Not great.,"My 7 year daughter was so excited until she did about 5 of the experiments. Not exciting. The funnest part was using the dropper and measuring spoon to measure the ingredients but on the instructions it says things like after adding the ingredients, now you have 2 cups of purple water. Get ready to blow your mind. Add one medium scoop of baking soda to one of the cups and stir it in. It changed color! I just wasn't that impressed and neither was my daughter, I would go with a different kind next time."
2,Ok,Ok not the greatest purchase would ot buy again wish it did more would not buy again not worth it
3,Good for an afternoon!,"Bought this product for my nephew for Christmas last year, thought it might take up more than just one afternoon, but it did not. That was a bit dissappointing, but he loved it. It was fun to work with, there are about 5-6 different experiments that you can do together, nothing that will hold up where he will remember it long term. My nephew is 5 yrs of age."
3,My son only played with it once.,I am all about learning experiences in toys and so I thought this would be perfect. I think I had more fun than my 6 year old son did. It wasn't anything that spectacular and when I tried to explain why things worked the way they did I lost his attention. Overall not bad but don't expect too much.
3,Hope she keeps using it,"My daughter could not wait to open this and use it. That said, after we used it one day for an hour of two, she has not asked to use it again. We'll need to break it out again!"
4,Excellent Entertainment,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew and he shared it with his little sister so a 5 and a 4 year old had a ton of fun with it. They enjoyed the experience but were a little too young to completely get the science behind it all. Either way, they enjoyed it and I think I will get something similar for the next birthday! As far as durable, it isn't something that you really beat or use daily so I couldn't really comment on that but it was certainly fun!"
3,overpriced,"Most of the items contained in this kit can be found in your own home or be bought for pennies, if you were aware of which ones were needed for the particular experiments,could probably be found in a kid's book for experimenting."
3,Missing Instructions,"I can't vouch for every single activity just yet, but we started with Activity 5, and quickly found the instructions were missing a step to add red cabbage powder to the other cup in addition to the citric acid and jelly crystals. Feeling some trepidation about the rest of the kit."
2,Disappointing,Purchased this as a gift but was quickly discouraged when I opened the box. The science experiments are really limited and it's just not a quality product. I suggest pulling out your own ingredients and performing your own experiment. You'd probably have more fun.
3,Excellent beginner's set!,Bought this for my son's birthday. He very much enjoyed it. I highly recommend this for those who are developing their interest in science.
4,A future scientist,"My grandson is turning five and he regards life as an experiment waiting to happen. For instance, he received a butterfly habitat and watched the butterflies hatch out then called me to tell me about letting them go. Recently we were in the backyard trying to catch fireflies! I bought this science kit to encourage him to love science. There were more experiments and materials than I had thought. He has already done four different things and has many more to do and just loves it. I see this as a good educational toy to inspire a youngsters interest."
1,Save your money!,"This product is a waste of money. Most of the ""chemicals"" (baking powder, baking soda, cooking oil. vinegar) you have in your cabinets. The vials are plastic although I was surprised they had a flat bottom and could stand. Look the experiments up on the internet and walk over to your cabinet and save your money!"
5,My 6 yr. old loves it,"My 6 year-old received this last Christmas and loves it. The instructions are clear, but the experiments do require parental supervision. My son used one of the experiments for a school project. There are enough materials in the kit to perform the experiments several times."
1,TOTAL JUNK!,"This is the most ridiculous ""kids"" toy I have ever seen. First the directions are inconsistent with many mistakes and contradictions. Second many of the experiments require the scientist, a young child, to wait hours and sometimes a day to see the results. What were these people thinking??? Not to mention many of the ""experiments"" are basically the same thing with very similar results. Save yourself the time and money and grab baking soda and vinegar for your own volocano and you will get better results!"
3,Was expecting more,"The kit was fun but I was expecting the experiments to be different from one another. they seem to be repetitive and basically the same experiment over and over again. Had I known , I may not have bought the kit."
4,Christmas Gift,I bought this for my nephews and they loved it. They played with this for days and their parents thought it was great as well.
3,Was a little disappointing,"The experiments weren't ""mind-blowing"" enough for the 5 year old who received it. This might have been due to lack of patience on his part or maybe he wasn't quite ready for it."
4,Great product!,My child enjoyed this product. It's a great beginner science kit. It comes with safe experimental ingredients. You can buy some replacement products from your grocery store.
5,Decent Science Experiment Kit,"I bought this for my 8-year-old niece and her three little brothers. She has run through a couple of the experiments and projects and says she really enjoys it.The packaging is pretty flimsy, but it's worth checking out."
5,pre school sharpies will find this fun and amusing,"With adult coaching, a four year old can measure, mix, and process the ""chemicals"" in the kit to get results that amaze. With a step stool pulled up to the kitchen counter, most experiments can be done start to finish by little hands. The kit contains most all of what is needed plus a few common items. The child learns all the lingo of the lab and some simple scientific methods. Worth the price. An adult needs to be on hand."
2,Really? Cooking Items and photocopied Manual?,Previous reviewers said it best. You know your getting overpriced plastic pieces but expect a nice manual a child can follow. Instead you have a crappy photocopied wall of text.. THANKS.. for nothin.
1,Terrible,"This toy left a lot to be desired. The fact that when my ten year old son opened the box and said, ""Where is the rest of it?"" should say it all. I am a microbiologist, but I thought this would be a good way to introduce my children to science without boring them to tears. Instead, I spent most of the time explaining why you shouldn't do what this kit says and you definitely should not use those petri dishes, and how you of course are not carrying around that much fungus on your fingers! I suggest getting a book from the library if you would like to do some science experiments with your kids."
3,Ehhh.,"I purchased this set based on the positive reviews. When we received it I did a few experiments with my 6 year old daughter. She enjoyed the experiments, and the instructions were easy to follow. However, I couldn't help thinking, ""I paid $20 for this?"" It seems that I could have gotten most of the ingredients/materials that were used from around the house or with a quick visit to some local stores. Also, some of the experiments didn't work as stated, even though the directions were followed exactly."
5,Fantastic Science Kit,This is a great science kit for kids. It helps spark kid's scientific curiosity. All the experiments are relatively easy but fun. You still need adult supervision. It's perfect for rainy afternoons when the kids are stuck in the house and need some entertainment besides tv or video games.
4,My daughter thinks it is awesome!,Good little science kit! It is fairly easy to use and all things that we needed were in the kit! She liked it and the experiments were fun. Adult supervision is a must but not hard to do.
4,nice puzzle,pieces are really nice and big and seem to be durable. Easy to talk through putting the puzzle together with my son because there are so many animals on it (i.e. let's put the giraffes together now!). I wish the colors were more vibrant - seem very muted and somewhat dismal.
1,Very badly made puzzles...,"We have several puzzles in out home, but none are as cheaply made as the Melissa and Doug products. The paper is of poor quality and the pieces are fragile. If you look at most of their packaging you'll notice that there is no large clear photo of the completed puzzle. It makes putting it together a bit frustration for children. Spend a dollar or two more and get a Ravensburger puzzle that will last for many years versus a M$D one time use."
5,M&D floor puzzles are great,"Bought this for me and my three year old who loves all the other M&D puzzles we have bought him. The pieces seem impervious to both his and his 1 year old sisters misuse of them (walking on and chewing on). Sometimes my three year old gets distracted before the 100 piece is together as it takes just a little longer than his attention span sometimes lasts. Other than that, he loves puzzles and he loves animals, zebras and lions especially, so what is not to like."
5,Noah's Ark Puzzle,"We love these floor puzzles for our 2 and 4 year old. We have 6 other ones, and all of them are challenging enough, but fun, for them to put together."
5,Great Quality,Large floor puzzle with big heavy duty pieces. Sturdy enough to put together on carpet. Approximately 4' x 1.5' I think.
3,"Holy Bible, NRSV, Black, by Hendrickson","It was okay for the price, but I expected more maps and such. It has only one or two maps, and that was a selling point for me. These were for presentation to 6th graders, and I will probably look for a different Bible next time. I also prefer a less-rigid cover and binding. They arrived quickly, though, and I appreciated that."
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"From a band who brought us the ""Fighting for the Earth"" masterpiece , this release is utter crap. It is typical modern UN-melodic American garbage that only fools latch onto. Marc Storace sounds ok but the guitar solos are weak and the songs even weaker. This is just not acceptable in 2004 when there are thousands of European bands blowing this down the drain. Please pass the Primal Fear , Sonata Arctica , Stratovarius , Metalium and Nocturnal Rites (REAL METAL BANDS). Forget this huge disappointment."
3,Shoestring efffects,"I enjoy fantasy movies, and dragons, or gryphons in this movie, are always of interest, epsecially when their presence in the story is central to the action. I guess I've got used to the high quality Hollywood or British FX seen in so many movies recently, that this one came as a real disappointment. From the end credits I believe an east european company were responsible, although I could be wrong. Whoever they are, or wherever they are based, I'm sorry to write that their efforts marred what was otherwise a well thought out story. I am particularly sorry because this movie cast Amber Benson, an actress whose work I always admire, in an action hero role, and she was particularly good at the cut and thrust of the sword and sorcery story. I was pleased that she had this opportunity to shine, just sorry that the FX marred the end result."
2,stoney gryphon hardly takes flight,"In terms of concept and plot, this movie is basically Saturday morning kids fare, with a cartoonish portrayal of the gryphon, a villain who belongs in a drag burlesque review, and a simple story line that will intrigue the kiddies, but is altogether predictable. Admittedly the story improves a bit as it progresses. And there are a couple of pg-13 scenes (gore, heroes about to make love). Overall, this is light-weight entertainment, and when approached as such, is enjoyable."
1,dissappionted,"To Whom It May Concern, I just received today (11-29-2011) The Holiday Wreath Gift Basket and I have to tell you I was extremely disappointed at the very least. Whoever set the price for this product should be ashamed. ($24.95 plus shipping)I understand you're in the business to make a profit but this is a sin. Shame on me this time but I will never purchase a product from you in the future and I will pass the word along to"
2,A Comprehensive Disappointment,"I don't know what's going on with this book. The prime difference between version 6 and version 7 is the inclusion of Adobe Lifecycle Designer. This book says virtually nothing on such an important area. It does little to address database connections.Unfortunately, there is no real reference for this program.It covers commenting and stuff like that, but overall it is a big heavy great looking book that has left me still struggling."
3,"Comprehensive, but so-so...","This is a comprehensive book on Acrobat, but it suffers from a lack of cross-platform coverage. Most of the book was covered with Acrobat for Windows, with the Mac as an afterthought. Mr. Padova has plenty of experience with creative applications with the Macintosh; his coverage of Acrobat, which is such an integral part of Adobe's Creative Suite, is disappointingly Windows-oriented It is comprehensive, but best served as a reference book. Windows-features such as PDFMaker in Office are well-documented elsewhere - I would have liked to see him cover the specific differences between platforms.I would also have expected that an author with so much experience with Acrobat to offer tips on performance, shortcuts, etc. Given the lack of Acrobat 7 books available, however, it is probably the most comprehensive one available."
3,Missing bird,"Antique dealer Abby Washburn falls in love with a beautiful birdcage built to look like the Taj Mahal. She bids on it at an auction and wins the birdcage, and also a bird named Monet.Abby's customers are charmed by the bird, but soon the mynah disappears. Abby is not too concerned about the missing bird and she and her mother sneak into an exclusive ball in disguise. Her mother is the next person who disappears, soon to be followed by her best friend CJ and her husband. Abby is frantic. Not too frantic, however, to stop her adventures with fellow business owners Rob and Bob. Abby spins through one adventure after another before she discovers where all the missing people are. This is a book which is geared more towards humor than to the mystery at hand, but it is a pleasant read."
2,A crying shame...,"RahXephon has slugged along at a steady rate, giving viewers little to adhere to, or be enthralled by outside of the incredible artwork. This DVD does provide some backstory, but doesn't tie in how any of it works, or why we should care. After these episodes I felt enlightened...but I am not sure why because the motivations and reasons for any of the histories or characters involved is immaterial. A lack of connection between events and reactions takes its toll worse in this disc then almost any other. The affairs in love and politics around the Earth defense forces doesn't get properly established most times to warrant a great pay off, and the same is true for almost any situation in every episode of the series to this point. Where it is going is secondary, I am just watching the incredible art and allowing the room temperature writing to wash over me as I wait for a 'shocking' resolve to WHATEVER is going on."
4,The first and best guide to the Goons,"Roger Wilmut is a great chronicler of 20th Century British comedy. All his books are worth reading, and this one-- a concise, well-written guide to the BBC's peerless Goon Show-- is no exception. Meticulous research and intelligent evaluation all in one package."
2,Disipionting,I would have though NationalGeographic would have gone in to more detail on the subject. All there was were 4 short seche that came to no conclusion. All conclusions they came to where quite arartary.
2,Disappointed in Many Things,"First of all P90x changed my life. I have never reviewed a product, but would like to express that I'm disappointed in P90x Plux. Here are my reasons:1. TERRIBLE MUSIC!! My wife does ChaLean, she gets results and the music is great and really pumps you up. P90X music is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. Buy it and you'll see.2. FAST NO FORM!! There is a guy in the workout named Mark Briggs. Don't watch him if you purchase this. He goes extremely fast and loses form and balance many times. Tony even scolds him sometimes.3. PROMO BOWFLEX!! Every 5 minutes you will hear a Plug: BUY BOWFLEX SELECT TECH WEIGHTS!!! THEY ARE GREAT!!4. NOT THE SAME TONY!! His tone, jokes, and enthusiasm lacks. It makes P90x something you do not look forward to doingI hope BeachBody makes a better workout than this alternative. If you buy this , YOU WILL REGRET IT."
2,P90X plus,"This was a major let down after doing the original P90x version. The workouts are not challenging at all compared to the original workouts, and the format is not as good either. Instruction is not as good, and timing between exercises is to close. I plan on using them to add into my original P90X workout routine as add ons."
2,PX90+ set was incomplete,I was not happy. The set was not complete. It was missing the yoga DVD. I tried contacting the provider--they will not respond.
3,Disappointed.... Going back to P90X,"I'm on my second round of P90X and found it to be a Great set of workouts. Sometimes they were a little bit long but once you knew the routine you could fast foward through as needed. Also I Loved Tony as a motivator and instructor. So I decided to try P90x Plus. Although the workouts are more intense. I found myself bored with the same 2 exercisers.Nothing against them as participants. They are in great shape but I enjoyed the different personalities in the original...Also, Tony acts silly and spends to much time flirting with the girl... Listening to him push the bowflex weights gets old real quick too. I wish he spent more time motivating us and participating in the exercises and less time trying to entertain.The routines do give you a good workout but compared to P90X as a whole package they don't compare"
1,Glorified Infomercial,"HATED IT.The P90X series of workouts was great and extremely effective. The P90X Plus workouts aren't workouts at all. They're infomercials for Bowflex, Power Stands, and Pull up bars. The exercises are extremely contrived and often just plain painful. Don't waste your money here."
2,P90X Plus: You just paid to see Bowflex's Selectech infomercial,"I'm kicking myself right now because I was actually aware of the ""bad"" reviews on Plus and decided to purchase it anyway. Plus is a huge disappointment compared to their classic series. Just as most of the other reviewers stated, Beachbody's motive for Plus was to clearly profit off the success of their predecessor. I enjoyed P90X because of the little equipment needed (pull up bar and bands). With Plus it's as if they want you to by the Bowflex Selectech dumbbells. There are moves that you simply can't do without dumbells. At least with P90X you could choose to use the bands. I wonder how much money Bowflex paid Beachbody to advertise their product."
1,All DVDs needed are not in the package,There is an instruction booklet with the DVDs which gives the individual instructions on how to do the P90X program. It seems impossible to follow the program is all the DVDs are not present. It will not be possible to get the optimum workout as prescribed by the creator of the program. I do not think that workout programs should be broken up into pieces/sets when this is not what is the intention of the creator of the program.
3,worthwhile supplement to the original,"My shipment arrived on time and was packaged well. The cost of the product was just average; it certainly is no bargain, but apparently it is difficult if not impossible to find beachbody prices below their suggested retail price. P90X plus expands on the original... sort of. I am in week 3 of the program now and it's kicking my @$$ as expected. But while p90x will test your endurance, stamina, and strength, X plus is geared more towards endurance. I can't see how this is going to build muscle, but it probably will reveal muscle! I am definitely more out of breath doing plus; expect a cardio paced workout! To critique Tony Horton, well, I just have to wonder why he moves through the stretch/warm up phases so quickly compared to the original. All in all, I am glad I have something to change up my p90x workouts. I have done two back to back phases of X and it does get awfully repetitive, so the 70 dollar price tag was worthwhile to me for a change of pace."
2,Misleading,The product description and pictures misrepresented this product. Thirteen videos were described and photographed. Only seven arrived with the 'complete' package. Disappointing.
3,"Great historical concept, bad execution and quality.","Yeah, I'm just going to make this short and sweet. They photocopied some of the wrong pictures onto the wrong captions. The pictures themselves are of terrible quality, albeit perceptible. Perhaps the size of the book itself stretched them out to unsightly proportions. You can still understand them, but eh, its pretty bad. I urge you to type in the name of the book on google and find a working pdf. The pictures are much better. I believe quite a few pages are missing too."
5,Novel of the Klingons of Star Trek.,"This is one of the first Star Trek Universe Novels that was not focused on one of the original Federation characters.This novel is about a Klingon and his trials and tribulations in the Star Trek universe.Different, original, memorable."
2,Not really that good,"This story starts out immersing the reader in a Klingon battle game, the rules of which are never clear. This opening only really serves to introduce the main characters of the book and is otherwise confusing and completely unnecessary. I almost put the book down because this section was so uninteresting.But it does pick up somewhat from there, when we follow Vrenn's life and his rise from humble beginnings to command a ship of his own. There are some interesting dynamics between the characters but as usual when dealing with Klingons, you're never quite sure who can be trusted or who will ultimately betray whom.Nearly every bit of Klingon lore and culture introduced in this book has been contradicted by the ""official"" canon of later TV shows and movies, so it's not even really good as a peek in the Klingon way of life.Bottom line - unless you are passionately interested in all things Klingon, I would pass this book by."
5,The Best,"I've read some 70-80 ST novels, or just about every one up till '97, which probably isn't as much as some of you, but enough for a good sample. This is one of the two or three best ones.Note that this was written in 1984, before Next Generation debuted, and so the Klingons portrayed in it are different from the Klingons in TNG, I prefer Fords depictation."
2,Diappointing,"The description says that this is yoga to do with your baby. When I got the book it seemed like 90% of the time the baby was on the floor while mom was doing the yoga. I don't need a new book to give me that idea. I can already do yoga with my son on the floor next to me. I wanted, and thought this book would give, ideas on how to do my yoga practice with him."
3,Redundant,Author provides very basic info. Wish that she would have included more anatomy and physiology. Much of the information was redundant.
5,If you love Petula...,"If you love Petula, you'll love this collection. Only a few ""throw-away"" tunes, and the rest are great."
4,It was ok,"This is their third album, and I don't think it's their best...but it was OK. All four girls got plenty of solos, which I was happy with, as their last CD only Faye and Anais got solos. As a new member, Janet did great for being in the place she was. It's not the best CD to start off with, but there are a lot of younger fans out there that would LOVE this CD. It's just songs like that are a little too young for older fans. Either way, I'd say buy the CD. It's cheap, danceable, and would also make a great gift for anyone (ehm especially a guy, since Anais is hott :-p)"
3,I'm sure I heard that before...,"I really want to like these girls. I really do! I love some of their songs, but I can't help but feel disappointed at how Play are constantly being made to sing songs by other artists!OK, I'm actually not sure who sang it first, but from their last album, I heard better versions of Just a Little, Honey to the Bee and Whole Again (by British acts Liberty X, Billie Piper & Atomic Kitten).In fact Girls Too is just a rip-off of Aikawa Nanase's (a huge Japanese rock singer) 'Bye Bye Boy', which was one of my favourite songs ever! And I just felt Play didn't do it justice."
3,Gets old WAY too fast,"this is play's first cd with out faye and with new member janet. its all pop nothing but pop. on replay they had r&b; and if they had released the right singles they could have gotten really big. Oh wellthe best song is dont stop the music cuz it doesnt get oldon evergirl the vocals are SUPER WEAKanother love story gets boring after the first time you listen to itgirls can too doesnt have anything to do with the titleI reccommend Replay instead of dont stop the music, but if you are a big fan of play-like me- you might as well get this because in my view this could be their last"
2,It's ok...,"After Faye left Play, it kinda sucked...(no offense or anything) Faye is the lead singer, and without her, it's kinda weak. the album is kinda weak, Janet gets a solo...and makes me wonder...Anna and Rosie (especially Rosie) has been in Play for so long and they dont get a solo? This album is more well rounded on the parts of singing...but it's not as good as Replay. But I would recommend it if you're a fan...if you dont like play that much, I wouldnt recommand it because REplay is seriously better."
1,please stop the music,"PLAY SUCKS, really people you call this music, i thought ony song deserved .5 out of ten stars but the rest would be zero and i think that i am being generous with .5!!!!!!!!!! don't waste your money this cd is not worth it!!!!!!!!!"
1,u call this music????????????????????,"(...) I bought this album thinking it would b good. I was so wrong. I don't like any of the songs on this cd. I gave it to my six year old cousin, who has no taste in music, thinking she might like it, even SHE hated it. This is kids music and a six year old hated it. They were never good and they never will be. Some advice DONT BUY THIS CD ITS A WASTE OF YOUR [money] Play should be banned from making musis. THe world would be better without them. Evergirl is the gayest song ever. A Briiney Spears cd would be so much better. 2 all u Play fans out there, find a better thing 2 spend ur money on, this cd is not worth it."
4,wonderful,It was wonderful! They r doing great but WE MISS FAYE!!!!! We like the new girl but we miss her!!!!!
3,No where near as good as Replay,"To be honest I think it was a huuudge mistake to replace Faye. She was the person who actually made them sound good. I'm not saying Janet is bad, but Faye shines way over her. I think this album is alright,and if your a play fan you'll like it i guess. But, if your a new play fan I think you should buy Replay and not this album. FAYE PLEEEASE COME BACK! My favorite song was Every Little Step, the rest was pretty much junk to be honest, and it seemed to rushed,and too disney. Well, anyway I hope this review was helpful for you!"
3,Reviewed by Roise!,"I like this c.d cause it was a more happier style then the last c.d but i miss Faye's voice and i dont really care for JAnet at all cause she seems like shes trying to imitate FAyes voice. SO i didnt really like Play as a group anyomore cause of Janet.C.D Downfalls=Half of the songs there are pointless re-makes.C.D Pluses= Anna and Rosie actually get to sing(a miracle!)JAnet Downfalls= Wanna be Faye.( I mean whats with that cheap red haircoloring she's got on her big head.)Janet Pluses= Nothing, Nada.Play stinks(since janets in it!"
1,Don't stop the Music.WAIT YES STOP THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Use to love play,but after Faye went to school again.I stopedbeing a Play fan.Janet is so ulgly!So is Roise.Faye had a greatvoice.Janet sucks bad!REplay was great!"
2,Mediocre L&H With Few Laughs,"Hampered by material better suited to Abbott and Costello, the decline of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy began with this badly conceived 1941 comedy - a sad comedown from the Hal Roach days. The Boys try their best to redeem ""Great Guns,"" but it's a losing battle. Stan and Ollie's lack of creative input is woefully apparent. If you want to see the team in military surroundings, track down the far-superior ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" (1932)."
2,Laurel & Hardy in an utterly forgettable Army comedy,"""Great Guns"" allowed 20th Century Fox to announce the ""return"" of the boys to the silver screen, but unfortunately this 1941 film directed by Monty Banks came out six months after Abbott & Costello's first starring vehicles, ""Buck Privates."" The comparisons did not help Laurel & Hardy, who are the retainers of the pampered son (Dick Nelson) of a millionaire. When their charge is drafted and goes off to prove himself in the Army, the boys get drafted as well to be with him. Actually, the lad does well, not only with the army but with a girl (Shelia Ryan), and it is Laurel & Hardy who have a hard time with the tough drill sergeant. The romantic plot line actually ends up taking center stage and most of the comedy routines are things the boys would have left on the cutting room floor in their hay day. Another sad feature film from the tail end of their great careers."
2,"Unfortunaltly, typical of their 40's films...........","Fox tries to form another Abbott and Costello out of L&H in this usually dull film that has very few bright spots. The boys spend most of their time wise-cracking with jokes that would be very funny coming from Lou Costello, but from Stan they just don't work. My advice? If you want a good WWII comedy, stick with Buck Privates."
1,the worst software on the market / do not buy,i have bought this software 3 months ago and i have been using until now but today i am throwing it in the trash. extremely slow and incomplete and the worst.
5,Without A Trace,"I've loved this movie for years and years. I think it is one of the worst fears a parent can have. I know the ending is hokey, but I LOVE it. Even when I tell other people about it I end up crying. I find myself recommending it to people all of the time."
4,Excellent movie!,"Excellent movie with superb acting,and script.The one criticism that I have pertains not to the movie itself, but that the DVD does not have either closed captions for the hearing-impaired or English subtitles, but I have just contacted the DVD distributor about that."
5,Love it...re-release it on DVD!,"This took a while to get to DVD, everybody who sees it loves it and now it is out of print. Let us have it again on DVD. I recorded it from a broadcast a few years ago and burned it to be DVD, but I would prefer to and would gladly buy a copy."
2,I wouldn't recommend this book for illustrators,"What little information there was about illustrating books was too basic and there was no index. Also, it included many illustrations from old children's books without identifying the illustrator or the book they were from. More than likely the copyright had expired on these images yet this practice irked me for two reasons-first, this shows a lack of respect, for not only those neglected illustrators but for all illustrators, and second, an aspiring illustrator may have been moved to investigate and study an illustrator that they liked had the name been listed. Bad form for a book whose intent is to teach.If you really want to learn about illustrating picturebooks, check out Writing With Pictures by Uri Schulevitz."
3,"Good book, but a little outdated","This is a good book about writing childrens' books, but with outdated examples and with bad and very outdated illustration examples. I had to laugh when the author mentioned the popular childrens' books of the day for preteens being the ""Goosebumps"" series and the ""Sweet Valley High"" series. Ha ha! Funny!"
3,Sound Problems anyone??,Wow I was so excited when I heard this was coming out. I paid [money] for it and was expecting it to be great. Unfortunatley when I watched it the sound was so incredibly [bad] that it was hard to watch. Is anyone else having sound problems? The title menu is a joke. They didn't even try to add any extra's or even a menu they just went to scene selection. Dont get me wrong I love sailor moon and the japanese series is good I watched it but this dvd is so bad. the sound sounds so far away and you have to turn the sound way up to hear it. I def don't think it was worth [money]. I am not a happy moonie.
5,Everyone complains too much...,"C'mon guys. Stop complaining. The sound is bad because it *IS* Mono, and it's from 92, and on top of that Toei had faulty master tapes. I personally didn't mind the sound at all. Trust me, after 15 hours straight, you won't care anymore. Besides, it's really only the opening and endings that are muffled.Also, anyone hoping for extras is just silly. Yes, it would have been nice to see the openings and endings without the credits, but we really don't have a right to complain or expect that.Anyway. The show is WONDERFUL. I was a dubbie once - I got hooked in 95 on the chopped up DiC dub of it, and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm really happy being able to see this. It's so much better than what was shown here (the US), it's indescribable. I see Sailor Moon in a very different (though better) light now.It's a must have for any Sailor Moon fan with $50 to spare (I bought mine new for $49 at another website). :)"
2,good intentions...poor folowthrough,"If you intend to make a bare-bones DVD, at least try to make sure the video and audio are up-to-par. Not to mention preview and opening placements. It is as if all the money for this project was placed into the box art itself. This is a real shame for stateside fans who have waited so long. ADV could have gotten better quality just by ripping the R2 import DVD's, slapping a sub-title track on it, and selling that. Many people would have been willing to pay more if the quality was worth it. A real shame that Pioneer didn't wind up with the license. The worst part of this is that ADV has nowhere to go if they even wanted to make a better quality version."
4,As Early of 92,"in 92 Sailor Moon have no way to resale in America,but in japanno how DIC was not in japan but only in america, sometime DIC have to stay with sailor moon in america but, but DIC no some time DIC don't want to go in japan but Sailor Moon call Pretty Soilder , Pretty Soilder Sailor Moon is Anime in Japanese, But I Want the DIC better like in Japanese and America, some time as the think is just like DragonBall Z, but DragonBall Z is for Anime, it for Boy of DBZ, and SM it for girl, but is not anything about girl, it all about Boy and girl in America and Japan will it True DIC don't to Remove to Sailor Moon in America, but in Japan Yes or No."
1,Johnnies an American,"I must truly be a yankee, cause I loathed watching this series with a vengeance. Oh it's the original all right, and I can see now why it was chopped to pieces for the US viewing audiance. The music blows, the transformations blow, and Luna, oh Luna, I miss the British goodness of your voice. If you grew up with the special messages at the end of the show, and enjoyed those tid bits of 'do gooder input' like I did, then you won't like this series. But I did enjoy seeing the teachers panties, and the infamous, 'I'm a stick and I want to lose weight episode.' Maybe it's the fact that I didn't have the option of dubbed, but how can you when the scenes don't match up anyways. So if you feel that American television ruins the Japanese animes then this is for you. However, if you like good music, and you hate glancing at the bottom of the screen every two bloody seconds(By the way, jokes aren't too funny when there in subtitle form.)then this, myself included, is not for you."
2,Season one Sucks in Japanese Audio........,"I had been watching Sailor Moon whenever I get the chance, but when ADV realese season one and two as a box set in the Japanese dilouge, I was mad!!! Geneon can do better!!!DON""T BUY THESE BOX SETS....... IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!Update: Reported by ICv2 in April 2010, Toei is now offering all 200 episodes refurbished of the series for internatioal soliction( I don't know if they included the two specials and the three movies though(please have someone answer that part)).Sorry it came so late."
1,sailor moon where is it...english...,yea the japanese ones are probably great but where are the english ones...there are way too many japanese ones...im sorry but theres a lot of people here that want them to...its like there not any where to be found not in stores or anything...ones you could download on kazaa too that are english and full
4,I waited so long!,"I got this box set as a gift and the audio is a bit faulty and the picture could be better and there's no special material which is why I couldn't give it a 5. However, I am as pleased as punch to get this as a gift. This is great for a Sailor fan like me who's waited forever to be able to have these episodes on DVD the way they were MEANT to be seen. Not VHS ""fansubs"" that could get eaten any time, and not some hacked to shreds dub like DIC where they all sound like british ditzes. Big thanks to ADV. :D! See what a horrible injustice DiC has done to this series!"
2,"POOR QUALITY, even when I got the pictured item","I own the pictured item (Sailor Moon Season One in the dark blue/purplish case with the silver silhoutte) and I just want to say that the audio quality is pretty poor. Do not confuse this with the fact that it's because it's in Japanese. (Which I prefer.) The opening title has a clean, crisp sound to it. But the dialogue in the episodes varies and sounds muddy. (Stupidly, I thought that turning the volume up would increase its clarity. Nope.) I dare say, it'd almost be more enjoyable to listen to it in English!As for the video track... I have better video quality on my VHS tapes I recorded off the TV!"
4,Sailor Moon -Season One (Japanese Edition),"This movie is actually good. Yeah you have to listen to the Japanese language and yeah you will have to constaintly read the English closed captions. But hey its not so bad. Its worth doing if your a real Sailor Moon fan. Hey, at least you don't have to see those stupid ""Sailor Says"" and no commercial breaks.Oh, and P.S to all the GUY'S that love Sailor Moon but are afraid to come out and admit it because Sailor Moon seems like a girls cartoon. I just got to say don't be afraid. I'm not. I know alot of guys who watch Sailor Moon. It's the action that got all of us hooked on it."
3,crappy,i give this 3 stars over all....the audio is muffled a bit and the video quality is in mpeg so its crappy but thats because these are old episodes...the japanese voice is hideous...its all high pitched and child like like a 5 yr old...but shes supposed to be 15!!!!.its really annoying and i dont recommend this unless your very used to japanese voices like super milk chan only...more higher...half the time theending theme came before the beggining theme... and half the time the english subtitles will go off so u have to go to the menu button alot...also..the one i got is not the same as that picture entails.i have a fold over thing..that has 46 highly crammed episodes on four discs...there is not two boxes and disc number 2 has the coverart for disc number 3 ...
2,Less than meets the eye,"What a disappointment! This beautifully packaged full-box set of SAILOR MOON Season 1 has faded colors and some of the poorest audio I have ever experienced. If I am shelling out well over a hundred dollars for a DVD set I expect some quality for my investment, and this ADV presentation falls well short of that. I've emailed ADV repeatedly for an explanation of the lousy sound and image but have received no reply. Looks like all their budget went into the packaging at the expense of the contents."
5,"Finally and at long last, the REAL thing!","Well, I was introduced to Sailor Moon through the dub, like so many others. I already had season's three and four (S and SuperS) on DVD, and was exstatic to find out that they were releasing season one!I LOVE being able to watch the full episodes, uncut, and most importantly MAKING SENSE! I never really understood how bad the dub was until these arrived. Everything is clear now.... and the acting is suberb!Like others, I would like to point out that it has been 11 years since the show originally aired, so the animation is not top of the line anymore. However, I have not experienced any trouble with the sound. (My TV is also about 20 years old, so maybe I""m just used to [bad] sound)The only warning I would give would be to stock up on tissues! The emotions run high all season, and I bawled while watching many episodes!"
4,Sailor Moon -- Season One,"I have been a fan of the ""Sailor Moon"" series since the 8th grade, when it was on Cartoon Network. I was thrilled to find out that the first two seasons of SM would finally be released, uncut and subtitled, to the mainstream masses. I had purchased a few fansubs but didn't like the difficulty with which I had to find them.I suppose the quality of SM season 1 is a bit shabby, but keep in mind that this is relatively old footage: the first season of SM is almost 15 years old, and has probably been sitting in a vault at Toei for almost as long. I for one, find that a small price to pay to finally be able to see Sailor Moon as it was meant to be seen, and not DiC-ified. I'm getting waay too old to be watching the DiC-ified version of this thing. ^___^"
1,There's a better version.,"I haven't actually seen this release of the uncut DVDs but from what I understand these are the releases from several years ago and they're pretty bad. The series was rereleased in an exceptional version with no fuzziness, darkness, or clarity issues. You can choose to turn the subtitles on or off and on certain seasons (3 I think is one of them) English dub fans can even watch it in ""original"" hideous dub form. The packaging of the new release is much more beautiful as well. If you are able find the other version. It is often referred to as the Perfect Collection. There are also Perfect Collection versions of the movies too if you want them."
4,Since 1995...,"DIC unleashed what was to be known as one of the first few anime dubs in its time. Compare it to today, and you'll defenently be surprised. The dubbed version of Sailor Moon was mangled like a rabbit torn inside-out. After a hiatus since 1995, someone took the care (thanks ADV) to release the first season un-cut! This is fabulous and I hope it's fabulous for you too.People who would be interested in this anime: Small Children, Young Adults, Even Grown UpsI gave it 4 stars because it's too expensive! Otherwise I would've given it 5!"
4,At last,"Finally, Western fans will get to see Sailor Moon without any psuedo-80's jargon(Wicked cool! He's so hunky!), second rate voice acting, and that English theme song sung by twelve yr olds that has been vexing fans for years.The only problem I have is with the quality of the picture and audio. It's been eleven years and does it show! Couldn't have been more of an effort to restore the poor sound and visuals?"
4,Best-looking box set,"Nice quality. Those are two extra-wide DVD cases (not two paper sleeves with regular DVD cases inside). Each case has one half of the season on several DVDs.I do wish the disc menu were a little nicer though. It's just a list of the episodes, and you can't turn on the subtitles from there, that has to be done with the remote for your DVD player. Not a huge issue, but a little inconvenient."
1,Poor Video quality,Yep I made the mistake of buying both the first and second seasons of ADVs IIRC unauthorized box sets. The video quality of both are horrid.
3,Good but not Great,Having just recieved Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Box set 1; I have to say it's almost everything I thought it would be - From the scenes to whole episodes cut from the US edition to the look of the set.The only negative is the audio which sometimes ranges from Tinny to slightly muffled. It would be understandible if it weren't for the fact ADV's other Sailor Moon DVD's in Japanese sound so much better then this.No extra's bring the score lower but in the end all the people it was meant for won't have any objections.
2,Shipper was good... not the product,"This was the firsth Hayes manual I've ever bought... well it's junk. If you really want something that works find the ""service manual"" for you vehicle. The Service Manual has EVERYTHING and tells you EXACTLY how to fix whatever needs fixing. This manual was junk."
5,Precious in the Father's Sight,This pocket devotional is a wonderful way to start the day! Each page lists a topic with a Bible verse and a thought from Catherine Marshall. It has been so popular in my women's Bible study that almost every woman has a copy (or wants one). I like it because each devotion is short and always seems to fit whatever it is that I am facing that day.
2,Careful,"I had a difficult time reading this book. I'd characterize the writing style as ""choppy"": it doesn't flow. All in all reading it made me dizzy. I'd suggest reading the exceptionally clear Robert M. Price (e.g. Incredible Shrinking Son of Man: How Reliable Is the Gospel Tradition?) instead."
2,2 80's horror slasher films for a low pirce,"I always had a soft spot for HELL NIGHT because I loved it as a kid. Watching it almost 30 years later it did not have the same effect. It's a lot slower than I remember it being. Linda Blair is gorgeous so it was nice to see her again. A bunch of college fraternity/soroity kids have to spend the night in a house where a bunch of murders took place. Unknown to them the mutated killer still lives there. Way too slow, needs more gore. As a child in the 80's this was cool.FADE TO BLACK just plain sucked. Real snoozefest that trys to imitate Alfred Hitchcock but it's a weak storyline with bad acting, not enough blood or suspense. One of the worst slasher films of this genre."
5,Fade To Black/Hell Night,"I give 5 stars to Fade To Black. Very cool low budget horror film starring Dennis Christopher. He never did much after this film. A very young Mickey Rourke appeared in this film before he disfigured himself with botched up plastic surgery he had done. Dennis Christopher plays Eric Binford a kind of loner/outcast who just doesn't fit in and is often persecuted by co-workers and his aunt who he lives with. His only outlet is the movies/cinema and is really into old films of the 40's & 50's. All hell breaks loose when his life becomes a part of the movies and he takes on another life as his favorite actors and he then seeks revenge as these actors against his offenders. His life becomes a movie and loses all touch with reality. The second film called Hell Night with Linda Blair(Exorcist Fame)just simply SUCKED. In case of fire, throw this one in. Horrible acting. I could act that bad. One to avoid is all."
2,"So, So Double Bill","I don't see what's the big fuss about these two movies especially Hell Night. The movies were okay with Hell Night being slightly better overall. The one thing which blew me away was AnchorBay's transfers of these titles, which were surprisingly very crisp with vibrant colors and without any imperfections I could detect.Fade to Black was interesting in its plot but there's not much going on here. It looks like a direct to TV release. It had potential. Well, they both did.If you have to pay more than $10 for the two, don't waste your time. Seriously!"
2,Flapper,didn't work--leaked water---didn't have that plastic hole reducer on it---needs that to slow down flapper from closing to fast------Bad flapper
4,Work good so far,Arrived quickly and was as described. Packaging claim it is made out of chlorine resistant material but will have to see how it holds up. It is not as thick as the OEM but not sure that is a big deal as long as it holds up. OEM flapper lasted 3 years but looked like it was natural rubber. I used this to replace the THU 138S flapper and it works fine. I also bought the direct replacement but though I would try this one out and no issues so far.I give it 4 stars since I'm not sure if it will hold up 1+ years so only time will tell but for the price it is an excellent buy and I iwll order this model over the red one due to the design.
3,"A small, yet great maple ""dictionary""","Of the maple books I have seen and viewed, this has been the cheapest and the most informational for its size. The book contains information, not only on Acer palmatum, but on all trees of this genus. It provides lots of good and useful general information on the care, propagation, and classification. It provides many pages of color photos of the many maples that are described in detail in the book. For me, this book helped me decide exactly which maple tree was to my taste and perfect for my gardern. So interested in maples? Get this book!"
5,Militart Advisors in Korea--KMAG in Peace and War,"An excellent book, well written. I recommend it to all who had a relative or friend in KMAG during the Korean War."
3,NICE DVD,NICE DVD I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. HOPE TO FIND MORE DVDS LIKE THIS AGAIN. THANKS AGAIN. WILLIAM
2,kinda crapulent,"the felts are fine but the cymbals sleeves are a total disappointment, they are soft rubber, and slip up the stand, so that they won't protect the cymbal for more than a minute or two. even if they stayed in place they are soft rubber, and would get eaten up pretty quickly. why not hard ABS plastic? why not include the sleeve that has a hard plastic base, so they can't slide away? this is a fine kit if you just need the felts, but i expect more from zildjian, they need to up their game if they want to claim to be the best in the industry- this really doesn't live up to their reputation."
4,drummers survival kit,"Liked that it had snare string in it, not just stuff for cymbals. Was shipped on time and I haven't really had time to completely use it."
5,awesome,just what i orderd. came in time with no damage. look forward to more great products. dont have nothing bad to say.
5,Nice Pack!,"It's always handy to have spares. Zildjian has always provided quality cymbals, and who knows cymbal hardware better than cymbal makers? I don't know... and that's the best part! Besides, it's cheap and it's all you need to protect your cymbals from that solid hardware!"
5,Great Add-On Gift for Drummers,"Purchased this as an add-on gift for Christmas for my boyfriend. He said these are extremely handy to have, and was glad to add it to his arsenal of tools. I thought maybe it would come in a box or hard packaging, but it arrived in just a plastic bag. I suppose I was thinking of it from the standpoint of gift-giving - it didn't look as ""pretty"" wrapped up. I'm sure that most people purchasing this could care less about how it is packaged. :) Overall a great gift and good value!"
5,It has what you might need,This is a perfect solution to missing small parts for your cymbals stands. It is good to have around. If you are a drummer this is a most
4,Cyclone Mack,"The band hails from Charlotte, NC, where I once lived. Sadly, I left before the group formed, although some of the current members were in groups I was familiar with during my tenure in the Queen City. At any rate, it's a refreshing,all-over-the-map sound that Cyclone Mack has, with cool elements of psychedelia colliding with way-too-fonky upbeat/danceable postpunk stylings. Having read some of the area media publications and their reviews of the band live also makes me regret never having had a chance to see them. But one day, I shall. Thumbs up all around."
4,Great Debut Album,"This music is refreshing and catchy - no two songs sound alike, and the use of some unusual instruments (accordion, mandolin) really distinguishes this band. I think the vocals are not really the strong point, but the melodies are good and the back up singing is interesting. I was sent this CD by a relative from Charlotte, NC, and most of my friends at the college here have liked the new sound of the band. I'd recommend it - and I hear they are good to see live."
4,Killer live act,"I saw these guys March 24th with the new singer and it was smokin'. I have seen them 2-3 times and this was the best ever! I thought the CD was great, but the other night was so far above anything recorded. Thes guys are light years ahead of anyone and I cannot wait for another CD. At least I have the first one and it is killer. Cyclone Mack sounds like no other group out there and no two songs sound alike . I think a couple of the reviews are sour grapes by friends of the old singer. It is funny how they love the disk but trash everyone except Kim. She was good, but the new singer Janelle is incredible and so hot! They were burning up the club and the whole place was groovin' to her----men and women! Good going guys--keep up the good work!"
3,Falling Short,"Having seen this band live I was struck by the amazing collection of geeks, dweebs, and spaz dorks. However, they do have an undeniably original sound. It's like speed pop, if that holds any meaning.The lyrics are not so hot, but the delivery of the vocals by singer Kim Corpening was quite impressive. In fact, the singing was fantastic.The rest of the band, most notably the bass player, hop and pop around like they are about to boil. That's all very entertaining, but, the only real stand out talent in the group for my money, is the singer."
2,Rather routine documentary,"This movie is a straightforward documentary-like film about the implantation of an all-artificial heart. My understanding is that this movie was produced before such an operation had been performed, so strictly speaking it's science fiction rather than a documentary. The acting is good and everything is straightforward. The problem is that the movie is very , very slow-paced and predictable. NOTE: I am penalizing the movie one star for showing HEART surgeons smoking like chimneys and boozing. Is it ""product placement""?"
1,Warning: Don't attempt to learn from book; buy my workshop!,"More ""great communications"" form the obfuscators of N L P. If you've shelled out for the workshops, the book may be useful. If all the other NLP workshop-transcription books were helpful to you, may be this one will be. If not... not.Good luck!"
5,Chenille rugs,"This is a soft heavy fabric, with robust color. Great to step out of tub or show on. Cozy on the feet and great cushon on the legs. I'm buying another even if it does put me on the back order list."
3,Not Soft,"This rug isn't as soft as I thought it would be. It feels rough on the bottom of my feet, which I don't like, but my daughter doesn't feel the same, so maybe it's just me. I would not say it was mint in color though. It's definitely a sage."
3,it is only mediocore quality,"not impressed with the quality of this product, it is not as thick and absorbant as some other reviews has made it out to be. The quality is only so so for $17. I would not recommend this to a friend."
4,A bargain!,"I ordered two of these rugs in Chili - a deep rusty red. I use them in the garage to absorb any wetness from my dog's feet before she heads into the house. They work perfectly. The color was exactly as shown. They wash well and the color has not faded at all. They did shrink very slightly; I only noticed it because I washed one before the other and there was about 1/2"" shrinkage. One word of warning, these rugs are not slip resistant. Depending where you use them, you may want to put something underneath them for safety. I found them to be exactly as advertised, and they were delivered very quickly."
1,not the color shown,This rug is shown as bright pink. It is actually very pale pink and I returned the 2 that I ordered.
1,Don't waste your money,"The box reads: - Enjoy Your Movies Anywhere - Select any movie, DVD or video file and DVD2Pod does the rest.Yes ANY DVD.. EXCEPT COPY PROTECTED DVDs. Yes, you can use other programs to copy the DVD to your hard drive, but I don't believe that counts as a 1 Click process, and you still have seperate video and audio files to deal with.The box also reads: Getting your video files onto your iPod has never been easier.That is probably the only true claim on the box. NOPE it has never been easier.. and this product does NOT make it easier either."
1,Save Your Money - This product deserves NO stars,"The packaging says ""Select any movie, DVD or video file, and DVD2Pod does the rest"". Unfortunately it only works with non-copy protected discs. All the DVDs in my library are commercial, and therefore copy protected. There are no disclaimers on the OUTSIDE of the box. This is just dishonest. My first hint of a problem was with the terms and conditions that must be accepted as the software is loading. It didn't work with any of my movies. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!"
1,Marketing Ethics 101 - How Not to Do It,"This product does not copy copy-protected DVDs. In other words, ALL of them. Although this is the right-and-proper thing to do from a legal perspective, the folks that make this have violated every possible ethical principle from a marketing perspective. The claims ""watch your movies,"" ""never be bored again,"" which appear everywhere on the box, on the promotional materials, and even on this product page, are clearly misleading and false. AND THE MANUFACTURERS KNOW THIS, and people have been complaining for ages, and yet they are unashamed of this behavior.I could see selling this product for $1.99 on the internet, to help you convert home movies....but since your home movies are already in mpg form you can just get iTunes to do that for you. So I take it back. There is no reason for this product to exist, and every $25 you spend on it is $25 you could have set a match to and received the same value."
1,does not copy any dvd that you will buy in stores to your ipod,"i tried to convert movies that i own to my ipod so i can watch on the road and it would not do it because of copy write protection. this program sucks it does not work, trust me save your money try using slysoft software instead."
1,Useless,"Along with blocking copyrighted material this software will not convert programs saved in your TIVO desktop. It searches only for programs with IFO,AVI."
5,"DVD2Pod works FINE, I use it all the time.","I downloaded this app months ago and have been using it without problem to convert DVD movies to my iPod 30GB. I guess they must have just recently changed the software to block DVD movies and taken all their beta versions offline. I use a Mac, but if anyone wants the file, I'll gladly email it to you. Out of all the DVDs I have ripped, I've had maybe 3 that I can remember not work.The other 90% always have. The Pixar movie ""Cars"" ripped without any audio, but I have all my favorite movies from my DVD collection on my Video iPod. If you are running MacOSX, feel free top email me, and I'll send it as a file attachment. stuckinraleighnc@hotmail.comseeya!!!"
1,Blatantly misleading waste of time and money,"I bought this with a gift card, figuring it was worth a try. Sadly, opened software is not returnable.As mentioned in other reviews, this software clearly states, ""Select any movie, DVD or video file, and DVD2Pod does the rest.""The only disclaimer on the outside of the box states the software is for lawful use only, and warns of the possible civil and criminal repercussions of illegal use. It says nothing of the inability of the software to convert legally owned DVDs for viewing on your own iPod.Biggest waste of $30 I've had in a while."
1,NO STARS - Misleading packaging,This product doesn't do what it claims on the box. I read another article and the company defends the claims on the box because they sell this product in countries that allow ripping of protected dvds.
1,Misleading!,Takes 50% of CPU as long as I let it (hours) with absolutely no results. Do not buy this -
4,garden hose reel,Liberty Garden Products 3-in-1 Garden Hose Reel With 200-Foot Hose Capacity 703-1-BronzeThis product is well constructed but when first tried it leaked from the hose bib and the connections.The instructions said that it may leak initially until the o-rings moisten and it did improve.I eventually bought some new washers and used a new one at the connection to the hose bib.That solved the problem.
5,expensive but nice,very strong and durable. it will last a long time. good quality. quite expensive though. Hold more hose than is listed on the website
1,"Very Disappointing--cheaply made, over-priced","Total junk, and what an inflated price! I expected something much stronger. This thing is so wobbly, even after bolting into the ground with the skinny little tent stakes (yeah, THEY'RE gonna hold it down in garden soil), you have to stabilize it manually while you reel up the hose. It only weighs about 10 pounds. Don't waste your money. Buy a plastic one with a heavy bottom (some you can fill with sand to keep them down). This is eye candy, but not practical and very cheaply made."
4,works fine,"I use this everyday with my roof cleaning business. It hold up great, I did have the replace the swivel. But other than that it works"
1,Money better spent elsewhere,"Well made but without the finishing touches. Sharp edges, rough turning mechanism. Lighter that you would expect- allowing it to scoot around as you pull out the hose as well as necessitating a foot on the base to hold it while you wind.Bolting it to a wall or floor would obviate the moving problem but not the sincerely rough cut edges of Entire unit.Pros: not owning it.Cons : everything about it."
4,Good Stretch,This video intensifies the matwork by simulating some of the reformer exercises using the flexband.I'd like more exercises for the lower body if this workout is to be revised.
3,Plot was flat and unrealistic,"This book had two storylines - and both storylines left you wanting more. Two old lovers reunite after being apart for several years - and even though both were still in love with each other - the factors that were keeping them apart did not ring true for me. It seemed like situations were contrived to add more pages to the book - and the plot that was used is one that a lot of authors have used too often. Especially in the case of Clay Calloway and Pamela McCall.The 2nd story line - with Kate Calloway was slightly better, but the characters had no depth for me. That storyline was a little better - but the overall book itself left me feeling flat and dissatisfied. The main characters - especially Pamela - were not that likable and I found myself wanting Clay to just dump her to find someone more worthy. I was disappointed with this book."
4,FINALLY!,"It isn't the best transfer in the world, but it is still such a treat that this funny, wonderful little fable has finally arrived on DVD. The story is simple and perhaps even slight, but this Neil Simon comedy, one he wrote directly for the screen, boasts one of his most enjoyable scripts, terrific performances, witty dialogue and a heartfelt message without in anyway being sentimental. The sparks and chemistry between Jason Robards and Marsha Mason erupt in every scene and the supporting cast, which includes Donald Sutherland and Matthew Broderick in his first film role, is stellar.The original publicity used the line, 'Everybody needs a little Max Dugan. Indeed! Get it and enjoy."
5,Top Drawer Comedy,"My VHS is on its last legs - and STILL no sign of the DVD release of ""Max Dugan Returns"". Where's the petition for me to sign demanding the DVD release?"
5,max Dugan Returns DVD,"Max Dugan ReturnsOne of my family favorites of all times. If you like heart-warming comedy, you will LOVE this one of the simple variety. Quality of the DVD was excellent!"
5,A GOOD TIME!!!!,I LIKED THIS MOVIE THIS WHOLE MOVIE IS GOOD. IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES JASON ROBARDS . THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT A MAN WHO HAS A LOT OF MONEY AND COMES INTO TOWN TO VISIT HIS DAUGHTER AND SHOWERS HER AND HER SON WITH EXPENSIVE PRESENTS THIS IS VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE. I ENJOYED IT A WHOLE LOT!!!
3,Enjoyable and Funny,"We enjoyed this movie. It's easy to watch and laugh with. Not a great story, but one we enjoyed years ago with our kids when they were growing up. Seeing the '80's cars and styles was enjoyable. Probably wouldn't appeal to young people today."
2,As a gift.,"Despite the title, there was no movie called Max Dugan, good thing too, because this movie was not that impressive. My gramps likes it, so I bought it for him, myself, I wasn't impressed. This movie has a place on everyone's movie shelf, even if only to prop a shelf up on one side so that is even with the other. All movies are worth watching once, this one rates slightly better then that, but more then a handful in your entire lifetime may be too many."
1,misled,"Thought this product was coming to me via ground mail. I was obviously wrong, it is downloaded somewhere...but I don't know where"
4,Great movie,This movie has been considered as a classic in my family. Great movie to have an part of your collection. 1 downside to this was I purchased this through instant download from Amazon.com. DONOT buy the instant downloadable copy if you intend to watch on your Apple devices. It's only viewable on PC devices.
5,XYZ is the best,"I absolutely love City Hunter, since I first saw it on an Italian TV station a very long, long time ago.Ryo Saeba is the perfect male character, and Kaori his best counterpart. They quarrel constantly, but when the time calls for it, they trust eachother blindly.Watch the hammer and enjoy the ride. (The second half of the season is even better)"
2,read the fine print,I bought this thing it was dubbed in english. Instead it only has subbed in english.
4,"Severin brings the weirdest exploitation to market, and this one's a keeper","Judge Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict -- ""The Baby really takes the cake. I read the description and thought there was no way the reality could approach the insanity of the copy, but it goes even farther. After the few minutes, we've already witnessed a grown man gooing like an infant, a babysitter who feels compelled to nurse him, who then gets beat to death for her trouble, and a pair of sisters who use him for their own purposes. By then, it's clear there's no social commentary here, only crazy. While The Baby is classified as horror, anything resembling that only occurs in the final moments, a truly bizarre non-resolution that fits into the nature of the film, and makes for a weirdly satisfying conclusion."""
2,Poo Poo,"I bought this movie because I saw all the positive reviews for it, I have a high tolerance for all sorts of cinema and love b-movies, exploitation, grindhouse ect, but this movie made me sick to my stomach, and not for the gore as there wasn't much of that, but watching a grown man crawl around in diapers for an hour and a half pretending to be retarded is not my idea of entertainment. I'm astounded so many people enjoyed this movie, I'll agree it is definitely one of the most bizarre things ever put to celluloid, but for me this flick has zero replay value and isn't worth any more than whats in Baby's diaper."
3,A perfect gift for film collector,"I didn't see the film because it was a gift for a film collector. I've been looking for this item for months and when I found it, I didn't doubt about it. I recommend it because it's a hard-to-find item."
3,The Baby,"I remember seeing this movie,(having seen it twice) in the 70's at our local drive-in. Back then it was some movie, and as I STILL remember it, it still is. To this day,I haven't seen anything like this! To quote ""The Video Movie Guide"", ""Extremely odd film about a teenager who has remained an infant all of his life (yes, he still lives in his crib) and with his insane, overprotective mother. Eerily effective chiller is entertaining, though many will find it undoubtedly repulsive, and rediculous"". I couldn't beleive it was re-issued again. This is truly, one hell-of-a remarkable story! I highly recommend it! Creepy! (In spite of the Mad TV skit.) Get it!"
2,Goo goo,"A very strange film about a seemingly (physcially) normal adult male who has the mentality of a baby - he's looked after by his mother and two sisters who treat him as a baby.Then a social worker takes an interest in the case. She has certain 'designs' on him, but not like one of his sisters who casually gets in his cot one evening for a bit of a quickie - obviously he's all adult physically - but this scene is not very explicit and rather quick."
2,maybe baby,"as a strange curio this film works rather well. it plays like a tv movie even though it was supposedly a feature film release. a good cast of actresses come togather for this tale. anjanette comer,ruth roman,marianne hill. the movie has an eerie feel to it, leaving you a little uncomfortable at times. dont want to give any of the plot away except to say the baby.....isn't. some good suspense. not a horror movie. so for good old b movie fun the baby will get you rattled."
2,Very Annoying....,This movie claims to be a horror but it is not. It is annoying. For the first 3/4 of the movie a grown man crawls around in a diaper or some velvet child's outfit and whines. Oh I forgot he attempts to nurse from the babysitter even though she isn't lactating and she enjoys it. And one quick hint at inscest. Aside from that the social worker tries to rescue the baby from the mother and two sisters. The ending is suppose to be a twist as to why the social worker is going to such great lengths but if the viewer thinks about it...it isn't that difficult. I made the comment flippantly towards the end and turned out to be correct. It was the most idiotic reasoning so it stands to reason.
2,Big Disappointment_Wah-Wah,"As a fan of weird/obscure/b-movies and after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, I was excited to watch this movie. Boy, what a disappointment. First off, the movie isn't really a horror movie. Yes this movie is weird and the plot is somewhat bizarre but it wasn't ""weird"" or ""interesting"" enough to pay around $20.00; trust me on this.Some of the bad points of the movie were: The grown man (who actually looks a little like Keith Moon in his later years) acting like a baby was pretty lame. On top of that, there were no cool sets or visuals. The acting was horrible (and not in a good, campy way). The dialogue and conversations were drawn out, boring, and annoyingly hard to hear.The ending was kind of cool but there were lots of plot holes that led to it. In other words, this movie is not worth your time or money."
3,A Cable Classic,"This was a movie that I used to love to watch on HBO. It has been a long time since its air time, but it was a good trip down memory lane."
2,This volume is only partial,"This book is a facsimile of volume 14 of the Whole Works, edited by Reginald Heber. It concerns primarily issues of church polity, discussions which were likely more interesting in the seventeenth century than they are useful today.I returned this and bought another collection of Taylor's works instead."
1,feels like another one,"needless compilation, that is. why do record companies feel the need to throw together one or two different songs and release a ""new"" compilation cd every couple of years. this same comp has been released about four times already by sony, mca, and warner brothers. PLEASE.. how about a remaster of the three Labelle cd's on Epic, as well as Patti's, Nona's, and Sarah's solo lp's. As for ""lady marmalade"" as a love song.....well....ok."
1,This stinks !!!!,"When are record companies going to stop throwing together these stupid compilations? This is just another blatant attempt to fleece the record buying public out of their money. If you're a Patti fan you should be insulted by this uninspired ""collection"" of ""love"" songs. Booooo!!!!!!!!"
4,a music lover,"This CD was very good, even though I thought I was ordering the CD of songs that were on the original album version from the 70's. This was not the case, however, I'm enjoying these songs just as much as I enjoyed those. They all have a great pop ballad sound & the duets are very easy to listen to. I'm glad I bought this CD because I was pleasantly surprised instead of disappointed, like I had feared."
1,Not What It Seems,"There seems to be a miscommunication here somewhere. The CD says ""Morris Albert"" and ""Feelings"" and ""Original Version"" on it, but it is none of those. The list of tracks Amazon has does not correspond at all with what is on the actual CD. It says Morris arranged, directed, and mixed these tracks, but he certainly did not sing any of them. If you're looking for the original recordings on the original ""Feelings"", you'll have to keep looking. Don't waste your money on this sham CD."
1,Not pleased,"I downloaded feelings from this cd from itunes and had the same dissapointment, this is an instrumental version and not the original, the cd recording company is falsely marketing this cd, do not buy it unless you want instumental versions of your favorites songs."
2,How to find 'original' song,Go to Barnes and Noble web site. The original song Feelings by Morris Albert is on a CD called Super Hits of the 70's - Have a Nice Day (Vol. 17)!!!
2,Deception in advertising,"The tracks listed on Amazon's website are the tracks on the album that went top 40 in 1975. This is the reason I ordered it. The cd that arrived is indeed the one pictured - but the tracks do not correspond to this listing at all - the only song in common is ""Feelings"" and this is DEFINITELY NOT the version released on either the hit single or album. You may like this cd - you may not. But at least let us know this is not the RCA album of 1975. Not sure who is to blame - the record label which says ""Original version"" or AMAZON for the wrong track listing. Either way - I feel burnt."
1,it didn't sound like the original recording!!!!!,i use to listen to the original version of feelings!!!! this recording was not the original and didn't come close!!!!i use to cry when i heard feelings in the 70's!!!!!
3,Promising Debut,"The first thing you will notice about Alisa Wolfe is her incredible vocal style that takes blues/pop/rock to new heights...in the style of other newcomers like Beth Hart. Alisa's debut shows incredible promise for her, songs like ""Far Reach Up"" and ""Killing Time"" standout as the strongest tracks while only a few (like her cover of Kate Bush's ""Feel It"") fall short. This is definatly a cd that you should pick up and look out for more from her in the future...I am!"
1,Poor Quality,"I read the reviews that were previously posted and I decided to ignore them because they were quite negative and I truly wanted this crib set. I learned an expensive lessons, don't ignore the reviews. The quality is very poor. The bumper lost it's shape 2 weeks after my baby played with it. The quilt tore at the seams of each patch. The materials are very frail! I know it's hard to take advise from a stranger, but believe me this is definitely not worth your money!"
1,Did not know,"This C.D. could not be played on a regular C.D. player, we did not know this when it was ordered. When we inquired we were told to return for a replacement, but this of course would also not work and now I can not get a refund at all for this product. It never worked in our C.D. player and was never used but NO refund. That is a rip off. When it was returned the first time don't you think someone should have mentioned it won't play in a regular C.D. player when that was the complaint on the first one we received."
2,Primitive - not my taste,"Probably I'm just not in the target audience. I hoped to find something like Alakazam, and was sorely disappointed. If this is an example of Anime - then I guess I'm just not an Anime fan at all."
4,"Interesting, offbeat repertoire","Dutch classical and concert hall music tends not to travel much outside of the Netherlands, so albums like the old NM Classics series are of interest for those open to different by-ways. This album of Dutch organ music is a very good survey that features well-crafted works which are not ""avant-garde"", from a nice variety of organists and on different instruments. The Willem Breuker work might be considered the most ""out there"", but doesn't come off as all that ""radical"" or ""dissonant"", at least IMHO. If you like to travel off the beaten path for classical music and are interested in organ music, this is worth listening to."
1,Not Happy,"Unfortunately, I never actually received this book. This may not be at the fault of the seller's, and it may have just gotten lost in the mail. However, when I contacted the seller to advise them that I had not received the book, they advised me to wait the full 30 days (after which my class would end and my use for the book would essentially be unnecessary) before I could get a refund. This was a bit disappointing."
4,A radio dram? a documentary drama? or a drama-of-all?,"If you are familiar with ""traditional"" plays like Shakespeare's or even O'Neill's (O'Neill's, in comparison with Monique's, may be conventional), you'd be surprised or even shocked at the reading. Monique's plays which in someway are connected with the postmodern milieu--everything is indetermined, and definition is not for certain. It is composed as an academic article--even with bibliography (and in the bibliography, the playwright would also tell you which book is preferred and which is not). It is composed as a ritual with songs and music surrounded. Most conspicuously, it is also composed as a documentary drama-- a dramatic story told in a documentary manner (since more than half of the characters are not fictional in history).So, my conclusion is, if you are one full of creativity and imagination and you intend to explore something unconventional (on stage), then, perhaps, this is a good start. --Yi Jou, Lo (Taiwan)"
2,Not Typical Niven,"Larry Niven (and his co-authors) usually write something either memorable or entertaining. ACHILLES CHOICE is neither. The authors (three of them!) reach hard to impress the reader by mixing references to the current ""exciting"" mass appeal physics of Chaos Theory. They then proceed to make flat characters behave in ways that no one with any experience would believe they would act. Not very typical Niven - not very good. Two stars because you CAN read the whole thing."
3,Achilles Choice - Personal Choice,"This novel is about love, life and sport. Based on a future Olympics where not only physical perfection is required but also extreme intelligence. It is a story where the nobel prize is inspired by elite athletes, and practical meets theoretical. It is a story of choices. Choose wrong and you may die. Either way you need to be fully committed to your descisions. If you are going to aim high in life then this is where you would be.Achilles Choice was a light but enjoyable read. I am looking forward to a sequel.I would recommend this novel for the age group 8-22 years of age. If you are an older reader the predictability of the storyline may be discouraging."
1,Don't bother with Achilles' Choice.,"This story follows a young athlete as she trains for the new Olympics, which include intellectual competition and a de facto death sentence for the those who fail to take the gold. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Ah, well. I have read of number of Larry Niven novels, and I understand the premise that maybe a book can be just a ripping good adventure, and not a contribution to world lit. But, ack, this was horrible. You will find the characters cliched, the plot ""twists"" too easy to figure out, and the ending is either a cop out because the author had filled the requisit number of pages, or a cheap way to prep for a sequel."
1,Boris Vallejo made this book readable,"Honestly, the cover is so fantastically campy that I had to read it. I found it while shelving books at the library where I work.The story was not too painful, especially if you skim through it, and the Boris Vallejo illustrations sprinkled throughout the book were my reward for sludging through the text. They're kind of like the marshmallows in my Lucky Charms. Awesome."
2,"Good idea, weak follow through","Reading Larry Niven's thoughts on the publishing world in ""Playgrounds of the Mind"" and ""N Space"" gives a good insight into why this book was published: simply to fulfill a contract. As usual, the concept is very strong. The story develops nicely and then ends in mid-thought. As an avowed Larry Niven fan, I was extremely disappointed."
4,"oh, that's right. i forgot all you niven fans are right","wingers. heh. i'm sure this book pissed you off. how dare niven and barnes deviate from the official narrative!this was a fun book. not ""great"" but definitely fun. it raises some interesting questions, and if you've ever been a competitive athlete at the highest levels, it speaks to you. try to read it thru that lens. it also supposes some concepts that are bound to challenge your political ideals, whatever they may be. but if you like to think about why people strive for power, and what they will do to get it, this is an interesting book. i'm a long time sci fi reader and i won't call this book original or groundbreaking, but i enjoyed it and it made me recall the other times when sci fi and sports have come together in an entertaining way."

3,Not Free SF Reader,"A short, entertaining, illustrated novel. Nothing too flash about it other than that. A woman decides to compete in an all-encompassing super-olympic style competition to enter society's elite.The only way to win is to take a drug to boost your performance. This drug will kill you in a few years, unless you do manage to win and get into the elite and get treatment.Behind all this is a conspiracy, and the woman involved discovers there is something not nice going on. Well, not nice compared to the get rid of competitors and other repression that is already going on, anyway."
4,A Wonderful Find @ Amazon,The St.Petersburg Times (FL)ran an article on an 82 year old military veteran who claims that he has healed from PTSD only because of this book.I tracked this book down.It is having a very positive effect on my life as I follow the author's specific recommendations.Self-Hypnosis by Wm.W.Hewitt is the book.
5,Life Transforming,"I have made several of these scripts onto CD's. From deeper sleep to work success you name it, the end results are 100%. There is no better person to hypnotize you than yourself."
1,Altoids Sour Gum,"I felt that for the purchase price, the gum wasn't worth it. The gum lasts no more then a minute in taste, but for that minute it is the most sour gum you will ever taste. I would not make the same purchase twice."
1,Adventure Yes-PNG No,"Having travelled in remote areas of PNG three times in the last ten years, I looked forward to this book touted as adventure in the real PNG. There should be more fiction and nonfiction written about this incredible country. To my disappointment, it turned out to be a sort of Indiana Jones meets Tobias Schneebaum. Yes, read it as a good adventure, but then go elsewhere to learn about PNG, its people, and its natural history. The picture presented here reminds me of the ramblings of disruntled expats ."
4,good quality,Don't waste your money with cheaper filters. This is a better choice and still not expensive. I found the openings to be the right size and shape (slits - not holes) to prevent the gravel from falling through to any great extent. The plastic it is made of is strong enough to last. My only complaint is the riser tubes were not quite long enough to reach the powerhead I chose when hung from the aquarium lip. Fixed that with a new tube that I cut to size.
3,Cute but not Great,"I bought this because i think it's cuter then the iDog. Ive been using it with my ipod shuffle and the volume is so low i just had to unplug it and use my earbuds instead. the noise of his movement accually was louder then the speaker, and i had it turned all the way up. Also I couldnt turn off his movements while I was trying to listen which was annoying. If I could have then maybe i could hear it better. Over all its cute and fun to watch dancing to the tv But if you want this for a speaker please get something else."
3,Son loves it!,"Although my son is just 8, he loves the I-CY. Mainly because he loves music, it's electronic, dances and has lots of flashy lights. So far so good. It hasn't broken, fairly durable, but runs out of batteries easily. You have to read about how to turn the thing off, it's not obvious, or you'll go through batteries like crazy."
2,I-CY,"If you want to see it dance- it is okay, but if you want to use it as a speaker, forget it. The speaker starts crackling at about a 3 level volume on an MP3. I contrast, it makes some pretty annoying sounds so you will pay attention to it, which are loud. These noises that sound like the thing is dying will also play during your songs. Annoying Annoying Annoying."
3,Okay,"it is fun the first couple of days you get it. But it gets anoying, and it just chugs the battery down. it is fun how it dances to the TV. But it does get anoying."
3,mediocre at best.,"these speakers aren't very good quality, and to add/change battery, you have to use a screwdriver. the penguin doesn't actually move that much, and it gets annoying after a while.better to go with legit ihome speakers.you get what you payed for."
2,my kid liked it for a day or two,"My kid had to have this for his birthday to go along with his ipod.He played with it for a day or two and then lost interest.It's pretty basic.When he dropped it on the tile it cracked,so I guess you'd say it's not too durable.It's a little expensive for what it is,but it made him happy on his birthday."
3,Fun iPod accessory,"The toy's response to music was fun to watch, although slow songs didn't prompt much response. This toy was smaller than I expected, but the child who received it was very pleased."
4,I-CY is adorable,"I have a lot of fun with I-CY, I call mine flipper. He dances and does a lot of things, mine also does what it says it will do. Dances and blinks to music. I keep him on my desk as well, he's a very good pet. If the batteries are low or not very good quality, he will slow down."
2,Cute but was played with very little,Purchased this for my preteen daughter for Christmas and it ended up in the bottom of her toybox. It was one of those things that was cute when she opened it but did not hold her interest for very long. I can not speak on the long term quality of the toy since she didn't use it for very long.
5,Dancing Penquin,"Got this for my 7 year old grandson for his 7th bday and he loved it. He got a new Nano and this just went with it perfectly. It is really cute and the sound is great, especially for a child. Glad I bought it!"
5,"Beautifully artistic, poetry in language!","I loved the whole album! The words are quite beautiful and all the songs were unique and special to themselves. ""madness"" is a very punky song, and ""Smash"" is beautiful with it's message it gives. And lastly, ""Last Waltz"" is unique and gives off a very ""bjork""ish feeling. It's definately an album to buy if you love The Rasmus and ""Dead Letters""!!"
4,UN BUEN RESUMEN DE CANDOMBE,"UNA DE LAS DEMOSTRACIONES MUSICALES MAS TIPICAS DEL URUGUAY, ES EL CANDOMBE. ESTE CD, INCLUYE VARIOS DE LOS ARTISTAS MAS SIGNIFICATIVOS DE ESTE PAIS. SI BIEN FALTAN ALGUNOS ENTRE LOS 3 VOLUMENES SE PUEDE TENER UN RESUMEN BASTANTE COMPLETO DE MUSICA TIPICA URUGUAYA"
4,Entertaining and informative,This book describes the lost science and peril of primitive and obsolete artillery. I wish it was a bit more informative on the manufacturing difficulties but perhaps that would be a different story in itself.
4,Vintage Jonatha,"Hearing Jonatha Brooke live makes me realize what a talented musician she is. The arrangements and harmonies are complex and really interesting. I'm not crazy about all the songs, but I very much appreciate her as an artist with something to say. I also like the DVD of her live performance."
1,Did not reiceive what I bought DO NOT ACCEPT HID COOL,"I bought this kit thinking I was going to get the JLM hid kit but instead I got a hid cool, so i decided i was going to give it a try and 2 months after I bought the lights one of the engines stoped working I contacted the seller and never heard from him again i lost 125$ in that transaction so beware"
5,A Christmas tradition,"My family has watched this movie on VHS for years. For those of us who grew up in the 1940s this movie takes us back to our childhood. It's a simple story and a simple plot with outstanding characters and acting. The Blu-ray brings it further into your living room. Simply put, I love it!"
5,Fun to watch,"I enjoy watching this classic Christmas movie every year during the holidays. It always makes me laugh. I read about the history of it, which makes the movie more enjoyable."
5,A Blast From The Past.,We never get tired of watching this movie. It brings back many of our favorite childhood memories. Not just the visual cars and clothing but the old family interactions. The lead character could easily have been my brother John. Thanks for the memories!!! Dottie from Staten Island.
5,a christmas story,"any one who can't overlook the mild profanity....which, in reality is never verbalized (it's all implied! ! ! !)probably doesn't know how to laugh anymore...too much holiday stress maybe? a christmas story is an INNOCENT tale of hope...one i gladly, happily share with my children and look forward to sharing with their children."
2,"""Full Screen"" dilutes this great film.","I have always loved this film; was a fan of Gene Shepard (the author) when he was on WOR radio in New York for years and thought he was first-rate. Read his book on which this film is based (""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash""). Enjoyed the movie in the theatre. But, they've taken this classic and chopped off its sides -- and thus emptied out both a great deal of its fun and visual power. Producers: DVD is a film-lover's format. If you must use ""full screen"" for some reason, please include the original format, too. Otherwise there is no compelling reason to purchase."
1,Sad excuse for a Christmas movie,"My son and friend had me watch this movie with them. What a sad excuse for a Christmas movie. There's no warmth. It's a story of a dysfunctional family with a sad excuse for a father whose fascination with the leg lamp is just too bizarre. The kid gets bullied and beats up the bully. Santa is supposed to be a kid's dream at Christmas. What does this movie show but a mean spirited fake who scares kids and ruins their dreams. This movie is awful. Christmas is a time for good feelings and faith, and this movie destroys the meaning of the holiday."
2,Either you love or you hate it.,"I've seen this movie every Christmas at my relative's house. I can honestly say I hate it. I've been searching for reasons why people actually think of this is as a classic up there with It's A Wonderful Life and A Charlie Brown Christmas. Pretty much the same excuse of every person who has seen this is that it reminds them of their childhood. I cannot contend that. However, I think the movie is actually pretty mean-spirited and after awhile pretty bland. In one sequence we have Ralphie uttering the F word and then beating up this one kid to a bloody pulp (with his mittens!) Then you have the scene where that one kid gets stuck to the pole with his tounge. They seriously should have gotten Roald Dahl to direct this movie! Not much of an ending either. He does get the BB gun however. Stick with It's a Wonderful Life for your Christmas viewing pleasures."
1,"If I could, I'd give it no stars","What is this junk? How can so many people think it's so cute and funny and consider it a classic?It's just about a whiny child who wants a gun for Christmas, and just about every adult tells him he'll ""shoot his eye out""! That's the 1940s' equivalent of a child asking for a violent video game such as the Grand Theft Auto series and parents saying, ""you'll end up shooting your next door neighbor"" in today's world! How can you call ""A Christmas Story"" a classic if it's a hypocrisy of today's standards?Yes, entertainment's entertainment. Movies are supposed to be fantasy road trips that takes us away from real-world problems for 90-or-so minutes. But I think movies tend to have a deeper meaning that is often hidden behind the superficial eye candy and storyline."
1,World's worst movie,"The tongue stuck the pole, the leg lamp, the bully getting beat up, the things that happen to people every Christmas. Yeah, we identify with all the stuff in this movie, but so what? The truth is that none of this movie is remotely funny. It's not one of those ""so stupid it's funny"" movies. It's just a movie that's so stupid you'll wonder what you're torturing yourself with it. I cannot say anything good about this movie. It's...just...bad! Over acted. Over played. Overly stupid. I just think that every time this movie is shown that people lose brain cells. Every joke made me groan in agony."
3,"Holiday cheer from the director of ""Porky's""","This is the story of a particular Christmas in the 1940s when little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wanted a genuine Red Ryder BB gun and was terrified that no one would get one for him. This film has become a beloved holiday classic, but somehow I seem to be immune to its charms. It's not a bad movie, but it seems more like a better-than-average TV movie than a Christmas perennial that actually won two Genies (Canadians Oscars) for direction and screenplay. However, I'll grant that the scene with the department store Santa is a classic.I guess I have to put this on the same list as ""Vertigo,"" ""E.T.,"" and ""Blow Up""--movies beloved by so many that just don't do it for me./"
1,No captions or subtitles,"Where the f**k are subtitles or captions on this? Download movies are a rip-off, and I suggest we level the playing field by having all the download movies released without sounds. :-)"
1,WHY is this movie so popular?,"I have no idea what is behind the popularity of this movie. It takes place at Christmas-time, but otherwise is one of the least Christmasy movies I've ever seen. Crass. Cynical. Depressing. I couldn't wait to put on Charlie Brown Christmas or something else afterwards to put it behind me. A complete waste of time."
1,awful,"I was astonished at how bad this was after so many friends recommended it. It's yet another example of a completely secular, materialist Christmas ""story"", and I found the enthusiastic greed of the main character, a little boy, repulsive. Yecchh."
3,It's okay,"Not one of my favorite Christmas movies, my husband loves it. I bought it for him. I think this is one of those movies either you love it or hate it."
4,Fun holiday story,Funny story thats somehow very real although overblown melodramatic. 13 yo liked it too. Don't know how I missed it all these years
3,Seen it many times,It's cute. I like it. I had credit to see an amazon instant movie. Don't know If I would ever pay to see it.
5,A fantastic classic,"Loved it when i was a kid and my kids are now watching it.A modern American Classic, must see around the holidays."
3,A Holiday Classic????,"Perhaps it was the build-up... I never saw this movie before today. People thought that I must be kidding but I was not. My daughter was anxious to show it to her young son, who wants to go shooting, to send home the danger/safety message. I always thought Ralphie lost his eye, but he didn't. Maybe it just didn't hold up over time. I did enjoy the lamp though. All these years of seeing such lamps in catalogs and I never knew it was from this movie. The movie was OK, but not likely to become an annual event for me."
5,"Classic must watch for all ""kids""","too many references here to be made amongst friends and relations for this not to be watched, repeatedly. Get it already, so you can watch it other than on Christmas eve/day on TNT with commercial interruptions"
4,One of my favorite movies,"One of the great Christmas classics. Watching it now with my young kids, I wish there was a bit less profanity (and thus four stars instead of five). Other than that, what a great movie. It captures exactly how I thought as a kid, and not just about Christmas and Christmas gifts...."
5,IT'S ME AGAIN!!,I have always fhought about my own childhood while viewing this movie. Somehow they really did invent video recording back in the early 1950's and somehow hid the cameras while taping me. I did what what I thought best to those masked muraders and Black Bart. Good thing I had Old Blue to help with that chore.........
4,Cute movie,"I've heard of this movie for years, but never had opportunity to watch it. We enjoyed it as a family, and it played without any glitches."
3,Will the true widescreen please stand up?,"Like many others, I was disappointed by the 20th anniversary edition's lack of a true widescreen version of the movie. What we got was a matted version of the pan-and-scan. This means it takes out even more of the movie than the pan-and-scan. Ridiculous.If you care about getting the true theatrical version, wait until someone on here buys this edition and confirms whether or not the widescreen is what is promised. If it isn't, save your money and get a used copy.I'll give it three stars. Five for the movie, minus two for the potential rip-off of consumers."
3,Special Edition soon to come...,"There. I've finally ensured that this title will be available in a widescreen special edition. Any time I break down and finally buy a DVD of a favorite film which seems to refuse to break into special edition form, within 12 months, it happens. I did this with Holy Grail, Evil Dead 2, and Wallace and Gromit.As I view it now, I find this edition to be very viewable. It looks better than it does on TV every year. It is clear and I see no compression artifacts. Sound is fine, although monaural. I would like to see it widescreen, fully restored, with commentary or retrospective interviews. It surprises me to know that the original laserdisc presentation was, in widescreen (1.66:1). Why they didn't carry this over to the DVD is beyond me.As others have written, I give this movie 5 stars and the presentation drags it, kicking and screaming, to 3. I'll write a new reivew review in a year's time once it goes SE."
3,"Not up to potential, but still great","I bought this DVD version hoping that the transfer would be of a somewhat higher quality than the former MGM DVD release. Unfortunately, it looks like they may have simply taken the pan and scan version that Turner owns (the Turner logo is prominently featured) and runs each year on TBS, and simply cleaned the video and sound up a bit.The video quality is fairly clean (no obvious scratches, dirt, hair lines, etc) and the sound is clear, but at times sounds like a slightly warped record (wavy notes).In the area of supplements, the DVD comes only with alternate languages, subtitles, and the theatrical trailer.This transfer is obviously not taken from the original print, and it's a shame, because it deserves it. The title, however, is worth the money regardless. The price is fair, and if a souped-up version is released in the future, it won't be for a year or two. In the meantime, given its price point, it's a good buy for those who love the movie."
5,A Christmas classic?,I have always enjoyed this movie mad this year is no different. A definate cult classic. If you haven't seen this I highly recommend.
5,best Christmas story ever!!,"This movie is the best Christmas comedy ever. From the beginning to the end, this movie encapsulates the Christmas culture of American youngsters ( well the way it used to be anyway). Every time I watch it I am taken back to the sights, sounds and feelings of what Christmas was like for me as a kid!! Excellent cast too, a classic!!"
5,A Christmas Story,Growing up as a child this movie was a family tradition. It is a great family movie which is totally hysterical without being crude or offensive. From Flick sticking his tongue to the flagpole to the leg lamp this movie is a classic in my mind and you will laugh from start to finish.
3,Beware the letterbox version.......,"Great movie, but beware of the ""widescreen"" promise on the DVD jacket. I've compared it to my fullscreen DVD and this one is actually just the fullscreen version ""matted"" to chop the tops and bottoms off the image(!) The image IS sharper than the fullscreen version, but someone's pulling a fast one here...*Sigh*, if a real letterbox version doesn't exist, why can't the studio say so instead of resorting to trickery?"
2,"Great movie, poor DVD.",Little to no extras. This great film deserves better treatment than this. We can always hope.
1,Bad experience,Movie only played halfway through then would not load...quit completely. Next time will just rent it locally from Red Box
1,DVD was scratched,I was very excited to receive this DVD because I heard great reviews about it. When I opened the DVD it was scratched and would freeze up when I tried watching it. Very dissapointment :(
5,One of our old time favorites.,It wouldn't be Christmas without watching this movie at our house. An old time favorite that our grandchildren are now enjoying too.
4,Classic Christmas Movie,Entertaining and fun to watch. Easy to purchase on Amazon. I like that you can watch it on-line after purchasing.
3,"Movie is Great, Quality of Picture is Not","Not the best quality of picture on HDTV, but story is great. Hopefully they will remake in new format."
5,"Yeah, yeah, I know...","...I know that WTBS runs this movie for a full 24-hours over Christmas Day. Of course, you can record it off the air -- you can even Tivo it.But guess what: the full *uninterrupted* movie is 100% worth having, if for no other reason than to encourage similar movies to be made.Who says that Christmas Classics have not been made since the 1940s?My favorite scene: Two little bullies have been terrifying the boys of the neighborhood, and suddenly (with appropriate provocation) Ralphie absolutely *BEATS THE SNOT* out of *both* of them, and especially the bigger bully. And then he cries when his mother stops the beatings. Then there's the aftermath of the ""fight"": but watch it for yourself.Also, some catalog offers a ""lamp"" exactly like the *Grand Prize* lamp. Oughta get one myself..."
4,A Christmas Story [Blu-ray],"Since I doubt anyone on the planet needs a review of the movie, I'll just give a quick review of the Blu-ray disk. Basically, it looks almost the same as the DVD, which is pretty good for an older movie. If you already own any of the DVD versions, there is little need to upgrade to the Blu-ray version. If don't have own a copy, them the Blu-ray version should be in your collection if you're a fan of the movie. There's also an ""Ultimate Collectors Edition"" just released, but it doesn't include any new scenes or extras on the disk. It includes a metal tin, some other goodies, and costs about $15 more. The movie gets 5 stars for being a Christmas classic. The Blu-ray disk get 4 stars for being nothing special."
4,A classic,"This is a great movie for the whole family. It wouldn't be Christmas withoutthis movie. It's funny, nostalgic, a trip down memory lane for some of us, and a view of the ""olden days"" for the rest."
5,Favorite film made better in HD-DVD,"One of our favorite Christmas movies is better than ever in HD! We enjoyed watching this every year, but this year it was as if we were watching a new and better version! The quality of the HD re-do is fabulous (unlike the HD re-do of ""Christmas Vacation""). We could see objects never before fully visible on the non HD versions. Thanks MGM/WB!!"
5,Really great,I begged my parents for a BB Gun when I was a kid. Didnt get it....it was too dangerous....Id shoot my eye out.Anyway....great movie....Ralphie got his Red Ryder. Good for him hehe.
5,A Christmas Story,"For some reason, every year I watch this movie. It think it's very cute. I enjoy watching it all the time. I think the kids did great in the movie."
3,Whatever happened to...,"While the ""extras"" on the new DVD are fun there is much lacking. Insights from several leads were missing - Mom, The Old Man, Randy. Where is the Buck Rogers footage that ended up on the cutting room floor? I'd also have liked a ""Whatever happened to..."" information. I knew Peter Billingsley spent much of his time behind the camera these days working with Jon Favreau on Dinner for Five, but knew/know little to nothing of the others. All in all this special edition is just ok. It could have been much more ""special."""
5,One of the best Christmas movies ever,"No really! If you haven't seen this movie, you have missed one of the best Christmas movies of all time. Watch it now!!"
4,Christmas day,My family and I ordered A Christmas Story because it's a tradition to watch it Christmas Eve and Day each year. We have not had cable for about a year now and ordering it on Amazon.com through our Playstation 3 was fast and easy the streaming quality was great and we were able to keep our tradition.
5,Fun Christmas movie!,"Since I was a boy about the time this movie takes place, I can really relate to this kid. It is a fun Christmas movie!"
5,Best Christmas Movie Ever!,"If you've never watched this movie, watch it now. TBS does 24 hours of A Christmas Story from 8pm on the 24th until 8pm on the 25th every year, and despite driving my wife crazy, I watch almost every minute of it. It's A Wonderful Life was a horrible choice and pales in comparison. So give the movie a shot and you'll love it. I triple dog dare you!"
2,Caveat emptor.,"Contrary to what is listed about the new Warner DVD of ""A Christmas Story"", it is only a fullscreen version and does not include a widescreen one. I think Warner made a mistake in re-releasing it in the same limited format as the earlier MGM release."
2,Great movie but no widescreen version...?,"I love this movie, it's a classic like no other. Truly capturing the essence of childhood.However, no widescreen version. I too bought this DVD with the hopes of viewing it widescreen and much to my chagrin, it wasn't. Very dissapointing."
2,Bad transfer ruined this one for me,"Classic movie, but non-widescreen transfer that suffers from ""wavy-ness"" and other odd defects really ruined it for me. Also mono sound! Argh"
5,HILARIOUS!!!! This is the funniest movie I have ever seen!!!,"This movie is absolutely hysterical!! Be prepared to revisit many of your own childhood holiday memories as you watch the adventures of this Midwest family during their Christmas season. I was in stitiches throughout the entire movie, but in so many ways I recalled several similar events that took place in my Queens, New York neighborhood as I was growing up there in the 60's. DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE...It is a definite must-have for your Christmas collection. A fun family movie that is loaded (and I mean loaded!) with hysterics.Will definitely leave you in a very jolly mood!Cris Cunningham"
1,My movie has still not arrived and because it is taking so long their is not tracking information.,"I ordered this DVD November 22,2012, and February 1, 2013 it has still not arived. I do not know who to call ect.This is the only way I have been able to communicate my discouragement. hopefully the movie will come before next Christmas."
5,best christmas movie,bought because my husband loves this movie. every year he watches it during the 24 hour of a christmas story & watches as many times as he can.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could....,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one in the bunch who thought this movie was not funny, not a kid's movie, and just plain depressing. I did snicker at two lines in the movie, and it was interesting to go back to the times when kids sat around the radio with decoder pins as their form of entertainment. But those three times I just mentioned, well that took up about 1 minute of the whole movie. The rest was depressing and torturous. I agree with the person who said they should have made it that he wanted the BB gun for his birthday, this way you could leave out the whole Christmas aspect, since the whole tone clashed with the spirit of Christmas anyway. If you want to see a movie that is a bit twisted/cynical, yet has the redeeming powers of Christmas, get Chevy Chase Christmas Vacation. Now THAT was a funny movie!!"
1,I GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE ZERO IS AN OPTION,"Why would anyone waste their time with this horrible piece of trash. Its bad enough the movie is for some reason on way to many channels, but come on 48 straight hours. Save your money and buy a real movie. Even UHF is better than this piece of crap!"
2,Not a good movie to let the kids watch...,"Despite the controversy over Jamie's provocative negative review, I happen to agree with him/her. While some parts of the movie were humorous I must admit, the movie as a whole was dark and mean. Swearing is glorified, as well as the violence. I watched through this movie before allowing my kids to see it, and I decided this was not a movie to let them see at their age. This movie does have it's followers, but you must see that this film is not one that young children should be seeing. Santa Claus is also portrayed as sinister, which kids will not understand and could be potentially traumatizing. I'm afraid to say that I did not like this movie. I do not believe that it should be considered a classic like Miracle on 34th Street. If anything, it should be a time waster for older, more mature teens. I'm sorry if I offended loyal fans of this movie, but that's what I think."
1,"Annoying, loud, obnoxious worthless bilge","All of the characters in this worthless piece of garbage yell all the time, both adults and children. They are all apparently whacked out on some substance. I'd love to know what it is so I stay very clear of it. Then there is the cloying, annoying narration/voice-over that makes the whole thing even worse, if that's possible. I can hear the characters yelling at each other in the family room, two rooms away from where I'm writing this, where my dear spouse is enjoying the movie. More power to her. My childhood was nothing like this movie, and could not be parodied or satirized as this movie tries to do. There is NOTHING appealing about this movie and I strongly recommend you watch a blank screen instead."
4,Great classic!!,"As always, this is a great movie! I use a playstation 3 to watch my Blu Ray's! The picture quality is just slightly better than what it was shot in, and the audio is still in a mono format, but it is still a great movie! I think the picture keeps it true to it's roots and give it that oldies feel, so they were good in not doing much to it! However, I do feel the audio could have been cleaned up and enhanced more. I will enjoy my blu ray Christmas Story!"
1,Not a children's movie,"I saw part of this movie while I was at my chiropractor's, and I couldn't believe my ears. In shock, I asked the receptionist what swearing was doing in a children's movie. She shrugged and said, ""It's pretty mild swearing, isn't it?"" I've heard some oxymorons in my life (ex. military intelligence), but that one took the cake!If you can get past the variety of black and blue words, then there's the ""lamp"" which the boy refers to as ""electric sex."" Again - in a children's movie?I'm just glad I never intentionally set aside time to waste on this movie. It's a cute enough idea; I even enjoyed the ""narration"" feel of having an adult male do voice-overs of thoughts and memories as if the story is told in retrospect. But it's not a movie I would ever want in my home, let alone have my children watch elsewhere!"
1,Movie,"My favorite Christmas movie of all time.....last movie I saw with my father before he died! This Version however was HORRIBLE! Almost as if it was in some foreign language,,,,,,the dubbing if you will was the WORST!"
1,Worst Christmas Movie Ever Made #2,"I agree with the other guy who gave it a one star review... this movie is terrible! I can not believe all of the good reviews! It's a bizarre movie, totally random, has a dark side to it and is just plain stupid. I love Christmas and Christmas movie classics like It's a Wonderful Life etc but this one is just plain bad."
2,Not a feel-good family movie!,"I can't figure out why this movie is considered a Christmas classic. The dad is a blowhard; the mom is passive and depressed; and there's a ton of profanity, some of it from the children! The solution to bullying is presented as beating the daylights out of the bully. Santa and his elves at the department store are positively horrid. The only bright light is Peter Billingsley, starring as the older son. He is charming in his single-minded quest for a Red Ryder beebee gun for Christmas. But my kids, 8 and 10, hate the movie and I wish I hadn't chosen it for our Christmas Eve flick."
4,Purchased as a gift,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for a friend several years ago. As far as I know, he liked it."
2,Linda,Cute kid but inappropriate language mostly from father. I was showing it to 8 year olds and felt embarrassed for their parents to hear their reviews.
5,A Christmas Story: 2 disc special edition,what a classic movie this is and all the extras on this special dvd set is priceless. a must have if you love the movie. product arrived when promised. A+++++ seller!!!!
5,Christmas Story review,"This is one of our all-time favorite videos, and we watch it at least once each Christmas season. It's a great, funny, nostalgic movie. Every year we laugh at the precious leg lamp in the window. We purchased several of them for some of our friends about our age (60's) who had never seen this movie, and all of them liked it as well. Even though we older ones can relate better to the movie, I think people of all ages, including children, can enjoy the humor in it."
5,I wait all year!,"Holiday classic in our home! Great time to re-live and share so many childhood memories. Wool snowsuits, getting tongues stuck on cold metal and of course ""you'll shoot your eye out""!"
4,I Can't Put My Arms Down!!,"You almost don't really need to buy this movie since every Christmas they show a 24-hour marathon of it on TNT--but I digress. This is a cute movie. It pretty much defines every kid's Christmas wishes and how disappointing it can be when you don't get what you want. My favorite scenes are Ralphie and ""the old man"" changing a tire--""Oh, fuuuddgge""--but we all know what he REALLY said, and the Christmas dinner at the Chinese restaurant--""Fa ra ra ra..."" Good nostalgic fun. A trip down Memory Lane for older generations, but the story is one kids, young and old, can relate too. Now hurry up kid, the store is closing!"
5,Great movie!,"I waited 31 years for this one, and I'm so mad I didn't watch it sooner! I loved the cute story and the dysfunctional but lovig family. I'm adding A Christmas Story to my list of favorites for the holidays!"
4,"A Christmas Story is a little off beat, but....","A Christmas Story is a little off beat, but....It good clean humor, which maybe a bad thing to say today, but it is strange enough for an older crowd to enjoy just how off beat it is."
5,Funny,"Christmas Story was hilarious back when I saw it in the theatre years ago, and also each of the many Christmas' since. My father loved it, I love it and my students on high school love it. Good clean humor that everyone can relate to."
2,awful,The movie is a classic. I recently bought this because it was blue ray. I wish I would have saved my money. The picture was just as bad as my original copy. Just save your money and watch it on TV. The picture is awful!!
5,A Christmas Tradition,"The Christmas holidays would not be the same without viewing, A Christmas Story. Nostalgic, funny, and heartwarming, it offers something for everyone."
1,Hideous Quality of Transfer,"Absolutely adore the movie. The transfer is shabby, foggy, poor audio. Worse than a VHS of it, which I am currently looking for. Why the heck can't they get a good transfer???? Crappiest DVD quality I've ever seen from a major house."
3,BD review,"Still a great movie, but the Bluray wasn't anything special. I'm no tech expert, but I didn't feel like it looked any better than what you'll see on DVD."
2,"Hurrah for movie, Shame on DVD","This is a must-see, completely charming, wonderfully acted (and I usually don't like child actors), heart-warming without being too mushy, Holiday Season story.But they made the DVD in Pan&Scan (except the opening credits, which are in widescreen). SHAME ON THE DVD PRODUCER!The whole idea of DVDs was that there's ample space for both widescreen and pan&scan versions. P&S (now called ""Full Screen Format"" -- to make you think it's a good thing) makes movies look like made-for-tv shows, with no vistas and too many closeups.How about an un-modified version of this terrific movie?"
2,Not worth the price for Blu-Ray,"The video on this Blu-Ray is no different than the original regular dvd.I expected an enhanced picture from Blu-Ray.I bought this Christmas package at Best Buy (last minute Christmas purchase), in hopes of surprising the family with a crystal clear enhanced version of this film.However, everyone in the family thought it looked no different than our old normal dvd.This set is a complete rip-off package. Stick with the original DVD for under $12.00"
5,Great movie to show your students,One of my favorite movies ever. I show it to my high school students every year and they too enjoy watching it.
4,A Christmas Story review,I had never seen the movie before. My grandsons and enjoyed watching it.We'll watch it each year at Christmas time.
3,Good product - not so suitable for young kids,"Sometimes you forget why a PG is rated PG - this would be one of them - we will be putting this disc away for 2-3 more years before letting our kids watch it in full - the ""oh fudge, only I didn't say fudge"" line is the perfect example !!"
1,"Love this movie, hate this DVD","You can't play it without the director commentary. I have tried everything, including the suggestion of the helpful person in the blog who suggested going to the language category and selecting ""English"" while it is playing. Nothing will turn it off, so I can't even watch the movie. How hard would it have been to put in an ""on/off"" switch?"
1,Where is the widescreen release?,I am surprised that they re-released this film on DVD and did not offer a widescreen presentation. I'll wait if and when that ever happens.
1,Fun movie,"Love the story/makes me think. of when I was a child. Also, Darrin McGavin and I have the same great-grandparents...making us cousins of some degree. .His Dad and mine were first cousins....my family watches thus movie several times every Christmas season. I highly reccomend it to any age of children as well as griwn-ups.."
4,Great Christmas family movie!,This is a yearly must watch. Having 48 hours in which to view the movie is also a great feature.
5,Hilarious Holiday flick!,"This is one of the best Holiday movies of all time! Contains great lessons for any rambunctious youngsters contemplating sticking their tongues to flagpoles in the dead of winter or playing around with BB guns . This one has become an annual classic in our household, with the film's hill-billy next door neighbors 'The Bumpuses' becoming a household name."
5,Top 3 Christmas movies of all time,"This is easily, hands down, one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. IF you havn't seen it, just buy it and watch it. Watch it every year for Christmas. Maybe its because I have seen it every year since I can remember. Maybe because it seems so close to home. Maybe I wish my family was like that, and it kinda makes you feel what it was like when Christmas actually WAS Christmas. It is not about gifts, ipods, iPads, computers, technology, or any of that garbage that means nothing. Its a story about a family from a kids perspective when all he really wanted was 1 simple gift, and his quest to get there. The writing is great, and its just a fun movie to watch. It has it all. Just watch it. You'll love it!"
5,Good Price,I specifically purchased this movie from Amazon because of the great price and availability. Everything was in great shape. I am very pleased with this purchase
5,The greatest Christmas epic of the modern era,"Move over Jimmy, we don't care about those angels, Ralphie and his Red Rider BB gun are in town to shoot them out of the sky. This is without a doubt the best Christmas movie in the last twenty five years. The cast and writing are so dead on, you wish you could crawl into your tv and actually be Ralph. If you don't get this movie, you don't get Christmas."
5,THE Christmas movie!,"Until you've seen this, you ain't had Christmas. You'll shoot your eye out! Enought said"
5,One of the Best Christmas Movies Out There!,"A Christmas Story is a MUST see for every family during Christmas time. Whether you are a young child or an adult, I guarantee you will love this movie!The main character, Ralphie dreams of getting a Red Rider 200-shot Carbine Action Air Rifle for Christmas. His mom thinks it's an absolutley horrible idea always claiming ""he shoot his eye out."" But his dad thinks a boy his age should own a BB gun. The main focus of the movie is what I just explained to you above, but their is much more to this charming movie. Ralphie fighting with the 2 bullies, Dad and his ""leg"" lamp, Ralphie and his hilarious pink bunny outfit he gets for Christmas made my his aunt, and many more.A Christmas Story is a MUST see for every family household there is. It is a great family movie! Highly Recommended!"
5,A Christmas Story,"I like this movie, watching it is part of our family's Christmas tradition. Brings back memories of the Fifties and winter in Canada."
1,Worst Christmas movie ever made,"Title says it all. I saw this movie as appalling from an actor's pov to a script. This had crap written all over it. And I like Christmas movies, well most, except for this one."
2,The Christmas Story,"This is a timeless Christmas movie that is comical and heartwarming. It leaves you in a warm, merry holiday spirit. No home would be complete without the lamp."
2,Average Holiday Movie,"I think people are just associating with their 80's era childhood while watching this movie. I think the movie was just average.I just watched this for the 1st time because there was so many comments that this was a holiday classic. I grew up in the 80's and missed it entirely. The movie was just ok for me. A few comical moments, but I don't think I would watch it again.For genuine Christmas Video Movie Classics, I recommend the Alastair Sim version of Scrooge done in the 1950's & A Wonderful Life"
2,1 dimensional,This movie is over-rated. It is one dimensional. The kid wants a Red Ryder Rifle - we get it. Nice - but not a classic.
1,"Horrible Movie, Very Unappropiate","I was very offended when I first saw this movie. First, Ralphie wanted a gun! Kids should not be exposed to the fact that there is such thing as a gun in this world, they'll shoot their precious little eye out when they hear that guns exist. Second, kids will never in their life hear F---, unless they see this movie. Third of all, kids think of Santa Claus as very nice, not as the really mean person in this movie. Also, they should not know that sometimes you have to wait in long lines! Also, they implied that the cute little bunny outfit is ugly and should not be worn by 10-year old boys. I want one of those for my thirteen year old boy! No, seriously I LOVED IT! Any of you who were complaining about the movie have no sense of humor and are not geared for the 21st century. You can see it from 8pm to 8pm EST Christmas Eve/Day on TNT.Buy it on video too, but I heard the DVD version was bad, stick with VHS. FIVE STARS!"
1,Buy the 2008 Blu-ray release,I have the 2006 version of this blu-ray disc. Tried to watch it this Christmas. It failed to load normally on two of my players and stalled/pixilated on all three of my players once I did get it loaded. Buy the newer version.
1,NOT WIDESCREEN!!,"Warner Brothers has a bad habit of releasing films in full screen format. DVD was founded on widescreen viewing. At the very least they should have included both on this disk. I have a 16:9 TV and so will nearly everyone else fairly soon. To bad WB, it would have been a great movie to add to the collection."
1,scary for Christmas,"I feel this DVD should not be a part of Christmas, maybe it should be shown at Halloween. I appreciate that this is how one man remembers his childhood but I wish my in-laws had never shown this movie to my children. They are not permanently damaged by this movie but it should be labeled as twisted."
3,"please, Ted",A holiday classic that deserves better treatment on DVD. TCM will run the widescreen version at least once a season. Watch and compare. When will the studios get it?
5,Great Holiday Movie,"Even 24-hours every year on tbs, it's a MUST OWN movie on blu ray. Wonderfully shot and depicts a great time era, post World War II Christmas. Other movies i'd recommend on blu ray: Love Actually, The Family Stone, Serendipity, The Holday. Christmas is coming, get in the spirit."
4,It Grew On Me,"First time I watched this film, years ago, I didn't like it. I thought it appeared trite and too simple. Over the years I have seen it a number of times and the film has clearly grown on me. It shows the personal reflections of a young boy dealing with the mundane things young boys face. Some of the scenes show just how ridiculous events and people (both young and old) can be. The film has sparked a cult following that has grown to proportions that the famous leg lamp is now manufactured and available for anyone who has the desire (?) for such a thing. This film is now rightly one of the Christmas classics."
2,Mistake,I bought this thinking it was a DVD. Never watched it. I need to be more careful when ordering DVD's on Amazon.
3,A Christmas Story,The concept of the movie and story line was a good idea. and it was nice to watch. I am glad I did not pay the money to see it in the theatre. Because of the media hype on the movie I had higher expectations of it. The movie could have done with out the naration like in the sitcom Wonder Years. In the end I did laugh and I will keep it for time's when I want to watch something slow moving with humor in it.
3,I did not receive Littlest Pet Shop nor did I order it. I only ordered one Christmas Story (not two as on this page).,"I enjoyed these movies because there was so much feeling, giving and love to others. A Christmas Story is ordered because I am sending it to a very dear sister who dearly loves the movie."
4,Classic,How could this be wrong for anyone. I like the ease in purchasing it. Good old Christmas classic. Eveyone should have it.
1,A Christmas Story - Don't Waste Your Time,"Saw this movie once, which was a waste of my time. Something I won't repeat; nor will my family. There are enough good Christmas movies around that this need never waste your time."
2,dreadfully clicheed and unoriginal,"I can't imagine why this film deserves the cult following it apparently enjoys--not that I am in any way certain that such a following exists, but I refuse to believe that any cable TV station would otherwise stage continuous airings for 24-hour periods. The characters are unappealing; the situations are unoriginal; the ""jokes"" that are tortured out of Darren McGavin are as funny as a crystal bowl shattered on one's bare foot; and the plot makes hardly any sense. Where the film endeavors to elicit humor--such as in the final Chinese restaurant scene--I find myself shaking my head, considering and reconsidering precisely whence I'm supposed to derive the giggles. And please tell me why it is the least bit funny to have a young boy solidly stuck by the tongue to an ice-cold metal flagpole! Steer clear of this trashy tripe, fellow Amazonians!"
3,"Good story, annoying presentation","A very good Christmas story through the eyes of a child living in 1940's Indiana. The problem is the way-too-cutesy adult voice narrating most of the movie. Unlike, ""Stand By Me"", where the narrator feels intergral to the movie, in this case, it seems tacked on, like a TV laugh track. Considering, what the narrator tells us is essential to following the plot, it's a shame they didn't pick an actor with a better voice. If you're like me, you'll long for those minutes long segments without the narrator!"
2,Fortunately My Memory Fails Me..,"I saw this movie as a kid and it stuck in my mind as a funny and witty show, so I decided to buy it for my kids and family to watch. Fortunately I screened it with my wife first and we were sorely disappointed by the about of crudity and vulgarity in a supposed family/children's film.Definitely not one for the kids, and not for the family."
1,The Most Irritating Movie Ever!,"I don't get why people like this movie. It's irritating and depressing. I feel sad that there are so many people that identify with this being what Christmas is like. The store Santa is a drunken criminal, and I can't imagine why he would keep his job. Kid's just don't drool and have as much snot as this movie depicts. If this is what the 50's was like, no wonder we're all on anti-depressants."
1,What were they thinking??????,What were the writers thinking? what were the actors thinking? and what are people thinking who watch this horrible film each year? i think the world has gone mad i tell you... there is nothing funny about this.... every joke is so over-done already; i see better disney channel movies each year!!! what happened to classics like White Christmas or It's a Wonderful Life? come on! what is better: seeing a leg lamp or learning the true meaning of christmas!!!! if i have to watch this poorly done movie again i will poke my eye out...seriously
4,Finally saw it!,"This movie is a classic, but we just watched it. The boy who plays the main character is delightful, as is the rest of the cast."
5,Remembering Christmas from a simpler time,WE Love this movie. Our Family watches it every year at least once. Every boy can remember wanting a BB gun.
1,Terrible!,"Gross! So much swearing and vile behavior! I can't believe this is rated PG. It was so highly recommended by MN Public Radio, et al. My wife and I shut it off when it was half through and threw it into the garbage."
1,bad DVD,Tape was poor quality would not play in DVD. was going to send it back but I could not find the return slip.
1,Yuck,"Everyone in my family loves this movie except me. I hate it. It is annoying from beginning to end and I refuse to watch it,"
3,Not Worth The HD Upgrade,"The movie is great as always, but the image quality was subpar for the other HDDVDs I have watched. Pick it up if you don't have it but, don't expect 1080P in all its glory."
4,Digital Mono???,"This is a great movie, I enjoy watching it every year around Christmas. However, if you own an old copy, don't waste your money on the upgrade....I was excited to see that is was a ""Special Edition"" and that the sticker says ""Newly Remastered Picture & Sound"" ONLY to find out the remastered sound is Digital MONO. Digital or analog, if it's mono, it's not very special to me. Still a great movie though, I just expected more sound enhancements."
2,Love this movie - hate the digital remaster,"Christmas tradition ruined this year. The remastering looked more like a live broadcast on steroids. Then the could going down - oh, Merry Christmas Amazon."
3,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to more insight as to the production citing humorous retake scenes, etc. Instead the entire second disc was a boring interview session with the actors, now adults and strange, so I was disappointed that I fell for the 2 discs-for-the-price-of-one sell!"
3,Not My Style,"Personally, I find this movie a little dull. It has some really good one liners, but other than that it's kind of slow and pointless. This was a gift for a friend, they loved it."
3,Good family movie,It was not what I expected but it it is a great family movie.It came to me in great condition and I would buy from this person/place again.
5,Christmas Story,"Excellent - this is our all time favorite movie and so much fun to share with kids and grandkids as to ""life"" in older times."
4,Best Christmas Movie!,My family's and I have been obsessed with this movie for years... A classic! Some dry/sarcastic humor... But excellent. Appropriate for the whole family.
5,Christmas Staple,Favorite!!!!! One of our family's great traditions on a cold December night. Fills the house with laughter and warmth. Great movie!
5,A classic,"For me this is right up there with Its a Wonderful Life for Christmas viewing. I watched it for years before I learned about the writer/narrator Jean Shepherd, who was a remarkable talk radio host in the 50's-70's and spun stories about his youth and daily observations on life and distilled a lot of that into this masterpiece. This movie is just as rich and charming, great family viewing and like a great cartoon, plenty of subtlety for the grown ups to laugh over."
4,You’ll shoot your eye out.,"Oh, come on, who doesn’t like this movie? Yes, it’s on various cable channels a zillion times in December, but there’s something very satisfying about watching it in its entirety and without the annoying commercial interruptions."
5,Classic,This movie is a Christmas classic. This movie brings to mind all the childhood wonder and excitement of the holidays
5,What more can be said?,"I first watched this movie on television in the early 80's. At the time I was wondering how there could have been a Christmas film that I had never seen before, not realising that it had been out for a short while at that time.I laughed throughout the movie as nostalgia shook my memory. I remember being told that if I had a bb gun I would shoot my eye out. I remember my mother washing my mouth out with soap, and when Ralphie's mother asked where he had heard ""that"" word his answer is Schwartz but he knew that it was his dad which has actually taught him the word. It reminded me of my youth as these things actually happened to me and others that I knew so to me the movie portrays a normal family for that generation. Oh to be able to go back to that time for just a few minutes.If you're looking to buy A Christmas Story then by all means go ahead. It's a timeless classic that will be entertaining both young and old a like for years to come."
5,Wonderful family movie!!,Great movie for the whole family!! I wish things could go back to the time of A Christmas Story!! Loved it!
5,A MUST SEE CHRISTMAS MOVIE,How can one enjoy the Christmas season without viewing this outstanding movie. Growing up in this era and getting a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas makes this movie even better.
5,A Must-Have Christmas Collection,"Few other Christmas movies have so little to do with Christmas, but so much to do with the joys and pains of childhood. Most people will find instant connections, and hours of laughter with the bizarrely unique characters of ""A Christmas Story."""
5,"Red Rider, Annie, and bunny pj's","This little film is a gem. From the snowy scenes to Ralphy's antics, A Christmas Story takes us back to a simple time when Santa andChristmas wishes made a child's dreams come true. Loved it!"
5,A Feel Good Movie for Christmas!!,"This movie is sure to make anyone, even a scrooge, feel good about family, childhood and Christmas. It is full of ""the way childhood use to be""."
5,You haved not TRULY lived until you see this movie!!!,"This has to be one of the best movies that I have EVER seen. I am in my late twenties and have a sister in her late teens, and we look forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas to recite every line, word-for-word in this hilarious movie. We were in heaven during the 24-hour marathon this past Christmas. The movie was pure genius. Every time we see the movie, we see something we didn't see before. Word to the wise: Never stick your tongue to a cold flagpole..."
4,Easy Purchase,"When I was asked by a freind to get her this video for Christmas, the first place I thought about getting it was Amazon.. Went on line and there it was. Service was quick and I received the video faster than I expected.."
5,"ah, fudge!","i've never stopped laughing at this film. the picture quality is a little rough on the titles, but it cleans up shortly after."
4,Composite of Book,"This movie was based on the book and although it doesn't have all the same events, it does have modified excerpts nicely pieced together for good entertainment. It does have swear words so it would not be suitable for little kids."
1,Christmas Story,"Did not receive the ordered wide screen version, very disapponited. We were watching the movie when I realized that it was the standard screen version. Feel like it was a bait and swithch ad."
1,Amazon Video streaming on the PS3 is unwatchable,"We have seen the movie before, but decided to watch it in HD via a purchase from Amazon. I should have remembered that using the PS3 with Amazon Instant video is unbearable. Netflix and all the others work fine with the PS3 but Amazon is not usable. You have to have a very patient group to sit and wait through the countless pauses due to bandwidth issues and buffering.We have 12 Mbs DSL and have no trouble streaming except with Amazon via PS3. All other streaming works fine with the PS3.Also, the optimize option Amazon presents with the first sign of bandwidth issues does not make a difference.And yes, we have deleted and re-installed the app, etc.Sorry Amazon, you really need to fix this problem, as I am starting to look at other options."
1,"Great movie, CRAPPY BLU-RAY TRANSFER!!","I don't understand why movie studios even bother re-releasing older movies on the blu-ray format if they don't even bother cleaning up the original film negatives for the transfer. That's the whole point. Don't bother spending the extra money on this format over DVD, its that bad of a transfer."
1,How is this not eligible for Prime,Good old movie but there is no way that a Prime member should have to pay for this ancient movie.
2,Didn't get what the description said.,"I ordered this item thinking it was a 2-disc special edition. When it arrived it was in the special edition box, but only had the first disc. I was down a Christmas gift and just very upset I didn't get what I ordered. I will be sending this back."
5,Ralphies Story,"Every year me and my daughter watch this movie around the Holidays and it is just as funny as the year before...The things Ralphie goes through to get the Rifle of his dreams for Christmas is hilarious..He goes to see Santa, writes the Great Essay and the sticking the pictures in between his parents favorite magazine..Im sure we all have done some of these things..Ralphie and his freinds and family give up a lot of laughs in this movie..."
3,Blackheart,"Blackheart had its moments, but was mostly predictable. Maria Conchita Alonso did an excellent job. A much more interesting character than she has usually played. Richard Grieco also did well, but nothing spectacular. The other performances were adequate, but to be fair, the story didn't have enough going for it to allow the actors to do much but just go through the motions. Christopher Plummer's character added some levity that would have seemed awkward, but as the movie started to drag this performance became more appreciated. The movie grabbed me early with Maria's performance, but later the story became more routine and even Maria's character couldn't add enough interest to keep it exciting."
5,Funny speculative fiction that isn't speculative,"Really great author. I laughed out loud many times. Such a funny way to write a satire about the world we live in. It was written in '85 but it's still relevant, maybe more so. Just don't try to wrap your mind around it while you're reading it. That's for after! While you read just sit back and imagine the world as described by Tichy. I have never really felt sad while laughing before, not while reading a book anyway, but Lem found a way to make that happen. Anyone that reads science fiction and doesn't take things seriously will like this book, even at face value it's a good, albeit trippy, little story."
5,Brilliant,"The sort of reality vs. fantasy world theme expressed in the movie The Matrix was far more thoughtfully developed in this very funny short novella. Substitute ""commercial electronic pop culture"" for its references to drugs and chemicals, and this book becomes thoroughly up to date. Everyone should read this book, particularly kids in late high school or early college. A mind opener."
5,Short and silly but very entertaining,"Is it science fiction? Fantasy? No, it's Stanislaw Lem's preposterous farce about the future. And it was written over 30 years ago, so we can see if we are getting any closer to it.In this story, very few real things remain in the world. Almost everything is an illusion, brought about by very specific illusion-causing chemicals.Maybe the best thing about this farce is the multitude of hilarious words that Lem invents. I've no idea how Michael Kandel managed to translate them so wonderfully from Polish. I liked the mimicretins (computers that play stupid in order, once and for all, to be left in peace). And when Ijon and Aileen get into an argument which she intensifies by taking recriminol. Or when Ijon has some of his illusions removed when he takes up'n'at'm, a powerful vigilanimide.Anyway, it's unusual and very funny."
4,"Absurd, hilarious, and strange...",Anyone with a quirky sense of humor or enjoyment of the absurd will enjoy this novel. Some political and philosophical symbolism within as well. Fans of Philip K. Dick will certainly like this. It's no suprise that Lem and P.K.D. were friends.
2,This sci-fi book did not appeal to me,"I was slightly bored by this book. I have read that the book is supposed to be funny, but I certainly was not tempted to laugh any one single time. In it Stanislaw Lem describes a future world where everybody is drugged. At a first look it seems like this future world, 2039, has achived Jeremy Bentham's dream: ""The greatest happiness for the greatest number of people"". But then Stanislaw Lem comes with another definition of happiness, which I actually think is more precise: ""My own happiness is not enough, the others have to be unhappy as well"". Forgive me, because I read this book in translation, so the quotes are bound to be incorrect. Allegedly the last quotation should origin from some French philosopher, it could be interesting to know who that guy was?"
3,Very Interesting Idea With Poor Execution,"I didn't enjoy this book so much as admire its premise. Luckily, it wasn't too long."
5,"Warm, compassionate guidance","This book is like feeling the steady hand of a warm, compassionate friend who will walk with you through every step-all the way from surviving the agony of your loss, helping you cope, recover, be resilient, and eventually find positive new meaning and purpose in your life. Is especially valuable for families and close friends of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack, and those who have lost loved ones in the military."
4,as described,the product arrives timely and appears as described. The capsules are average size and fairly easy to swallow without any funny tastes.
2,It's better than nothing,"This video is minimally helpful. Yes, I'd recommend it to others simply because it's the only radial arm saw instructional tape out there. Curtis speaks very slowly with a monotone voice. You don't see his radial arm saw started until 35 minutes into the video. There are only two types of joinery shown - and one of them is an advanced technique which requires very special jigs. Nope, he doesn't show you how to make the jigs."
5,Great Armband,"Works perfectly with Nike+ iPod (the transmiter sticks out the bottom, no big deal) washable, durable (logos are coming off, again no big deal). Very comfortable on long runs (I have been on many 10+ milers with no problem)."
4,Great 1st CD,"Music is great, lyrics need some work with the beat but still sounds good. RJay you have a great 1st CD, keep up the good work. You will go far."
4,Very good and unique,"I got RJay's CD when he came and performed at my school in Marion, Ohio. This CD is awesome and I think tracks number 2 and 5 are the best. This guy has an awesome voice and his style is unique and unlike anything I've heard before. He is definitely going somewhere, and I urge people to buy this CD because it's very enjoyable and believe me, this guy can sing and he has a very charming, polite personality."
2,Ok...,"I think the music is okay. Although, it would be a LOT better if there were more upbeat, danceable songs. Other than that, I think it's good"
2,Disappointing,"I found this book much too polemical. Thomas also fails to fully address the situation his book is supposed to describe- the Kiwi Camara incident. For example, Thomas makes it sound as if Camara was completely ruined when he actually went on to become a Stanford Law professor. The wikipedia entry on Camara does a better job at explaining what happened."
5,What Every American Should Know About Law Schools,"From personal experience and as a professional, I know that this book is not only an accurate indictment of Harvard Law but also most of America's other law schools. This book should be read by anyone considering a career as a lawyer or any interaction with the legal system.What leftist social activists have failed to achieve through the legislative and executive branches, they have been very successful at achieving through the selection and indoctrination of future attorneys and judges. Reading Thomas' work gives one full appreciation of the 'why' behindcurrent debates over abortion, the death penalty, gay marriage, illegal immigration, and other issues dominating the news and clogging our judicial system. The way these issues are handled in law school shape the legal arguments and judicial decisions interpreting our constitutional and statutory rights."
5,IntellectualConservative.com strongly recommends this book,"Andrew Peyton Thomas, the district attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona, and a graduate of Harvard Law School, has put together a well-written, intriguing expose on the state of free speech at his alma mater, providing an insider's perspective of the top law professors in the country. Oddly enough, the friction over free speech is not between the political ""left"" and the ""right,"" because there are practically no conservatives in the administration or on the law faculty, and the majority of students offered admission are also of the leftist persuasion. The battle over free speech is between the ""left"" and the ""far left."" (p. 170) Conservatives are rarely mentioned in the book; the major players consist of traditional leftists like Alan Dershowitz versus the new leftists, known as ""Crits.""To read the rest of this review, go to http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article4340.html"
3,Condition,"The condition I received this dress in was a little suspicious. It came wrapped in a single, white tissue paper and crammed in a small box (almost the size of a shoe box). It also didn't have a size label, which made me furious because I wanted to know how to take care of the dress. I wasn't even sure if it would fit me. I tried it on and it proved to me that it was a size small like I had ordered. I like the the dress, but too much about it makes me question it's credibility and legitimacy."
3,It's ok but not good if you're an hourglass figure,"The dress is nice but very formfitting around the waist which didn't look so good on me because I have a small waist and wide hips. It accentuated those features a little too much. If you have a small waist and wide hips, I'd stay away from this product, but other that that, it's a pretty dress."
4,Nova Developments Print Explosion,"Simply the best software for creating personal projects. Contains hundreds of ready made templates for just about anything you would need or want from cards to banners, signs to crafts, labels to envelopes . It is easy to navigate with the graphic interface. Thousands of clipart images and photos are include for just aboput any occaision and all are 100% scalable"
4,Easy to Use,"I've used Print Explosion for several years. Makes nice cards, fancies up envelopes for holidays, etc. It's fun to use."
1,White Stripes At All the Seams,"I was shocked when this dog came bursting at the seams which makes it look like it has white stripes wherever it is stitched together, including the ears and a white dot on the nose and on the mouth. I can't be bothered returning it so I am taking a black marker to it. Hopefully that will do the trick; if not, it goes in the garbage. If not for the white on a dog that is supposed to be black and tan, it would have been a really nice stuffed dog. It would have been very realistic looking, but it just looks cheaply made as it is now."
1,Bad craftmanship,I am using this for a display and again like another viewer wrote I also have a lot of white showing thru...but it is not going to be played with so I am not going to endure the expense and time to return it.......and to me it is not lifelike but will do...........
3,Eh,"Got it for my child's birthday. He loved it, I did not. Some of the fur on the dog is missing,has a few bald spots,just looks cheap."
5,"""BUDDY""","This was a gift for a my daughter whose Dachshund ""Buddy"" passed about last month. This was her life long friend and companion and even though this stuffed animal will never replace her pet it is a really good resemblence to it him.Thank you very much!"
3,Cornell Campbell release somewhat lackluster,"As a fan of the Blood and Fire label and roots reggae in general, I was disappointed with the selection of tracks out of Cornell Campbell's repertoire. The ""Gorgon"" is perhaps the strongest track on the album. And although some of the dub trailings are really creative, the preachiness of most of the tracks of this album makes you wonder whether Blood and Fire really selected Cornell's best tracks. I'll conclude that a wider variety of Cornell's rare cuts over a longer period of time would have made a more effective compilation."
3,Classic Manuscript of Brick Patterns,"At first glance, the book resembles an ancient work by Palladio or other. The drawings are beautifully simple yet a bit coarse for today's standards. The book is made up mostly of patterns and elevations; text is limited to a 13-page index and a some explanations on tools and methods. Overall, the book is quite useful, but missing are the following: pictures, better diagrams, some data about the architect, etc.Although the format is absolutely stunning (meant to resemble an old manuscript), this book is not for everyone. It should appeal to the designer, architect or contractor."
4,PIE WITH A DIFFERENT FLAVOUR,"OK,SO THIS CD ONLY FEATURES ORIGINALS RIDLEY AND SHIRLEY....""BUT"" THIS IS A GOOD CD.BOBBY TENCH WHO SANG IN THE COMPANY OF JEFF BECK DOES A NICE JOB ON VOCALS AND THE BAND IS TIGHT.I WAS CURIOUS WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD BUT WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS NOT YOUR TYPICAL...""LETS COVER PREVOIUS MARRIOTT STUFF"" AND EXPLOIT THE HUMBLE PIE NAME,WELL I TOOK A LISTEN AND LIKED IT.STEVE WOULD BE SMILING THAT RIDLEY GOT TO ROCK ON ONE MORE TIME BEFORE HIS PASSING.""EARS TO YOU""!!!!"
5,"Thanks for the memories, Greg",Greg Ridley's death in late 2003 makes this quite good and vital effort an even more poignant tribute to Steve Marriott and the Humble Pie that came before
2,without the cockney sparrow no way,"humble pie reforming without the late great genius stevie marriott is unthinkable i do not believe what i'm hearing thse guys are as bad as queen and inxs who've reformed just to bleed abit more cash out there die hard fansand what do i hear when i put on this cd i hear somethingforeigner or europe cheesy eighties rock, where's the soul of humble pie i'll tell you were it is with Stevie marriott the force and backbone behind this great bandi've already taken my cd back,,,if you want something good listen to the recently released stevie marriott solo album ""all stars"" a cracking album of two halves with soul and hard rock a classicnothing like this cd shame on you humble pie"
1,Humble Pie 30 years past prime minus Marriott,"I'm writing and rating this to balance the bewildering dominance of 5 star reviews with lots of helpful, supportive votes. Such reviews and helpful votes may lead some consumers to believe that this album rates a masterpiece that is an essential addition to any respectable record collection. Please keep in mind that this is Humble Pie, 30 years past their prime and without Steve Mariott, the foundational (not just a founding) figure of the band. Gotta love the mindless fanatics that can, at times, dominate customer reviews at Amazon. How can such an album rate a masterpiece or essential is beyond me. How others can validate such nonsense with their votes of approval is beyond me as well. Please balance the ignorance with your helpful votes for this review. Trust me. This album, which I bought as a $1.99 cut-out out of curiousity, is nothing more than a shadow of past accomplishments."
4,We liked this book.,"I disagree in some part with the Library Journal review. First, the book is not salaciously edited for instant gratification. Rather, what I liked was that it introduced the reader to a number of Latino and Latina authors whose work I will want to explore much more. I recommend this book as both an interesting and fun read, but also as a way of learning more about a lot of authors."
3,It's ok...,"Having read some of the stories in Spanish,I will say that some of them have lost the magic and the beauty.The charm of some of the stories is just missed..."
1,NOT dishwasher safe,"I purchased this can opener because it was well rated and looked like something my husband would enjoy. On the Amazon website it clearly states that it is dishwasher safe. However, the packaging specifically states that it should be hand washed and to not put it in the dishwasher. If I had known that it was hand wash I would not have purchased three of these."
1,Will go in the trash,"I picked these out as a substitute for the sugarless gum I've been chewing for years after reading one too many horrible things about aspartame. I looked at the label to see if they contained artificial sugar, but none such ingredient was listed. (I noticed the minis touted themselves as ""sugar free"", so I thought I'd be in the clear with these.) Then, I tried one. I kept it in my mouth about 3 seconds before spitting it out. It is the most chemically-tasting ""natural"" mint I've ever tried. The tin will go in the trash, unless my husband wants them. They're terrible."
5,"Hard To Find ""Wintergreen Mints""!!","I am very pleased with this product, the expiration dates are really good-I got a fresh product and in a very reasonable time. I will order from your company all the time now. Thank You for your very good service! Sincerely, Dianne L. D'Andrea"
4,cheap treats,This is a great way to get your Altoids without hopeing you'll find the flavor you want in the check-out lane. Plus the price is very comprable. Plus the wait was short..
1,ugh - why did they change the taste to this?,"I loved wintergreen Altoids! In fact I loved them so much I stocked up last year at Easter when they were on sale for half price. I had enough to last until this week. So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery. Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible! What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these? I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste - nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side-by-side). If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet, don't buy them. You will be very very disappointed. I'm going to return the unopened tin and see if the grocery will take the opened one back too."
1,Another Victim Of Product Improvement,"I hate when this happens. When I have a product that I love, but someone comes along and just cannot leave it alone. They are somehow compelled to improve it. I loved the original wintergreen Altoids. They were, for me, a near perfect confection. But the new, improved wintergreen Altoids are an abomination. They do not have the smooth, cooking wintergreen taste the original ones had. The new ones have a nasty after taste. I'm going to throw this tin away, I hate them that bad. And I will not be buying anymore Altoids, wintergreen or any other flavor. When is corporate America going to learn the truth and wisdom in the old saying: ""If it aint broke, don't fix it!"""
1,no more wintergreen,I always enjoyed the wintergreens. My local store only got them sometimes so it was a treat to get them. Now what wrigely did to them make them suck. Now its more like blessing to get spearmints since now they are overstocked with wintergreens because nobody likes them. All i can say is wrigley you made wintergreens a cheap mint.
5,when survivors unite,"This book sets the record straight with inspiring stories about normal people overcoming great odds. The stories are not so much of loss and hardship, as I had expected, but of overwhelming strength and courage. It is unbelievable to see not just how people have beaten the odds, but then how they have gone on to make a difference. A wonderful book!"
4,A nice slice of horror,"It is a treat to finally cut to the kill in your favorite horror film without having to touch the remote. Just pop this DVD in your player and sit back with the lights off. It's almost like Cliff notes for horror. I enjoyed seeing my favorite killers fed to me a slice at a time. It brought back memories of all the old films, and some of the new, that I loved so much. In the next installment, I look forward to seeing a few more scenes from a few less movies, so you can truly get the best of your favorite killer."
2,Serious false advertising,"From the commercials, you would think this movie was composed of all of the best scares in horror movies, however, all it does is fall flat on your expectations. The movie has all the popular ""boogymen"" but only has one or two scenes from each of their series. There is no way you can go into the history of these scary characters by extracting only one movie. Before you know it, the movie is over and you're left wondering, ""what just happened."" If you pay more than 10 bucks for this, you are paying too much."
4,can't wait till vol. 2!!,"Boogeymen is so going to be a classic. This movie has all the big screen horror maniacs all in 1. At first, when i noticed that it wasn't all of the movies, i was a bit taken aback. but i knew what i was buying so i bought it on dvd newayz. It was so good! my sister, and bro were so excited about seeing it we didn't even wait till dark like usual. So, not to spoil it by watching it in day light, we played the ""name that frame game"". It was cool, it was dark when we decided to finally watch it. This is a good movie but some of the movies shouldn't of been in it. such as: Phantasm, I Know What You Did...., and the Guardian. Some of the movies didn't even have sequels so, I can't wait till they come out with some creeps like: Mary Lou from Prom Night, the chainsaw killer from Slumber Party Massacre and etc."
4,Good Start,I think this DVD was a good start to what i hope are more features in store. My cousin gave it to me as a b'day present and I did enjoy it although i thought that there were more scenes that should have been included. (Then maybe they are saving for Boogeymen II.)The commentary was great and i had fun playing the trivia. Waiting to see whats next :-)
1,"Oh, Man! Just Rent it...","I love horror movies, particularly ones that put you in the place of a victim who is being chased by a [insert weapon of choice here]wielding madman. It claims to a sort of ""Best Of"" horror compilation, but nothing could be further from the truth. While it does have some pretty impressive villains -- Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc. -- it also has some characters I'd never heard of before -- Simon from ""The Ugly,"" for example. Unfortunately, all the ""special scenes"" they've picked for the Giants of Horror lack any real terror to them at all. I was particularly disappointed by the scene taken from ""Nightmare On Elm Street."" They could've done much better! It also includes original horror movie trailers (nice), a biography of each Boogeyman (nice), and an special game you can play on the DVD (lame). Overall, it might be worth renting if you're bored, but it lacks any real gore, blood, and horror, so you're bound to be disappointed."
4,alright,"this movie was alright, i wacted it twice. the quiz on the dvd is pretty good. they might make a squel with some thats on here and ones such as pumkinhead, the headless hourseman etc. if you like horror rent it, buy it. but if you don't then don't wast your time."
2,no no no,"are u kidding me? this compilation wasn't that great.i'm 16 years old and i've seen just about every single horror movie there is...i'l admit it there were some good scenes on this compilation but what in the world was camilla(the gaurdian)all about???i have never scene that movie before and i don't want to.she was possed by a tree...now how dumb is that?? plus i thought this was calle ""boogymen"" not ""boogywomen""...she was awful...and another thing who does the tall man think he is???making an army of dead folks...thats rediculous...i watched that movie a thousand times just to see if it was just me or if the movie was terrible...and i was right it was terrible...my little brother was cracking up...so anyways that was the only thing i had to say about the compilation.everything else was fine...don't any of you be mad at my views...its my opinoin...but i hope i get some responses...thanks...bye"
2,Not worth it,I don't know what thes eother people are talking about. This dvd is just commercials strung together and some of the pop up videos aren't right. I got a free copy from my brother and it's not all that great. Just rent the real movies. I am surprised to see it for sale on amazon. I'm glad this was for free.
3,Not Bad,"Boogeymen the killer compilation, was great when it came down to Freddy, Jason, Chucky, Pinhead, and Michael. A little weak in the department of leaving out some forgotten killers Angela Baker (Sleepaway Camp) or Ricky (Silent Night, Deadly Night), maybe even throw in Pumpkinhead. Putting Ghostface in this film was not that great of an idea, hint: ghostface was played by numerous different characters, not just one killer, not like Leprechaun or Leatherface. Why throw in the Dentist and not Dr. Giggles. This movie missed out some other popular characters (Carrie, Cujo, Rev. Kane (Poltergeist)), but I suppose that if they threw everyone into one film there would be no sequel. All in all, it was well put together for what they did. Buy it? Rent it first."
1,The Worst of Horror...What is this [stuff]?,"As a fan of horror movies -- particularly the 80s slasher films -- I bought this DVD with high expectations. Let me get straight to the point: I was VERY disappointed. While the DVD features such legends as Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees, the scenes picked for them were awful, weak, and BORING. I couldn't believe how little attention was given to these guys. Overall, I was disgusted -- the real stomach turners are the Hellraiser/Puppetmaster scenes which prompted me to trash the Taco Bell I brought home for lunch. Some unknowns and ""unimportants"" (as I'll refer to them) are also featured, but as their scenes [stink] and I haven't seen the films they star in, they matter little to this [poor] compilation. Save your money. Go rent a comedy instead. That way, you can eat later."
3,Satisfactory,"For the genre fans, this DVD does do the movie goer justice; lots of information on all the boogeymen presented. Englund does a good job on the narration. The interactive game was clever too. The only flaw I found was the actual presentation of the feature. I was under the impression that the all of the ""starts"" would be presented in a documentary format, rather than a individual scene for both. Not as long as I would have expected it to be too, which is why I only gave it an average rating. It is good to have and own, since I am a fan, but I would recommend any fan who wished to have this to buy it used; it isn't worth the price for the material included."
5,great quality,"This is a great DVD you can't afford to miss out on! The quality of the entire DVD is great, and all the clips I expected to be on it were there! The best part is the interactive things, it makes it much more than just a bunch of scenes slapped together."
5,HORROR 101,"For less than a buck a clip, more than 3 hours of viewing, you can get a sampler of the best Horror films of the past 20 years. I suppose you could call it Horror 101. This is an excellent collection of some of my favorites as well as a couple I've never hear beforelike the Dentist, and after seeing this segment makes me not want to go to the Dentist for a long long time. Some other cool features on the DVD include facts and trivia, audio commentary by the one and only Robert Englund. Highly Recommend!"
5,play some catch up,"Ok, so if your idea of a horror film is JAWS, you're gonna need some schooling. Help is here, Boogeymen is a quick study on some of the most popular horror films to date. This session not only includes the best scariest parts of the films feature but excellent commentary from one of the horror genre icons, Robert Englund AKA Freddy Krueger."
4,Nice but too many spoilers,"Overall a good collection of some of the best Boogeymen in horror films, yet one beef I had is that some of the clips give the ending away and may ruin the film for those who have yet to see the film. The DVD also includes a good commentary, slide game and a number of trailers to some of the films it showcases. All your favorites are in there as well as a few you might have overlooked. Makes a great addition to any horror library"
5,"For people who are scared to watch horror movies, this is for you.","I was 10 years old when I originally bought this DVD 9 years ago at Suncoast for 20 bucks. I was always interested in horror films but was much too scared to ever sit down and watch one. This collection of 20 short scenes was exactly what I needed. I could take small doses of the horror at my own speed, which eventually built myself a tolerance up to where I can now watch any horror film and not even flinch. The Boogeymen DVD got me into the horror game. Will it get you in as well?"
1,Caveat Emptor,"Mediocre at best!! In addition to having clips from films no one in the Western Hemisphere has heard of, the choice of chosen clips and editing of same is arguably questionable as far as the 'slasher' genre rules apply. Barely worth the money..."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"You'd do far, far better renting/buying the movies that are mentioned in this sad excuse for a collection. I will give it ONE star for just for the mere appearance of Pinhead on the disk. There have been better scenes, but that is the best from the first Hellraiser movie. I'll give it one other star for the very small trivia ""game"". Just having Robert Englund speaking to you, either in mock or with pride at wrong/right answers, is worth one star - if I must. I like Robert... so for him, in support of him... there is one final star. I could make a better dvd than this if I had the equipment and the time to do so. Believe me, I would if I could. Look how many suckers bought this thing (sadly counting myself amongst them)."
4,Weak yet entertaining,"Although Boogeymen features clips from 17 great horror films, I found the particular clips to be rather weak. I've seen about 2/3 of the films featured and while watching, I could think of scarier scenes, especially from Nightmare On Elm Street. However, I also found the compilation to be entertaining and after viewing it, I wanted to go out and rent the films that were featured, but I never saw. I've only seen the VHS, but hope to soon see the DVD--I'm sure the added commentary will make up for the weak clips. If you haven't seen it, I do recommend it, only if you're ready to see weak clips from great movies. In the meantime, however, flixmix.com, the movie's site, has some neat stuff on there to look at, including horror trivia."
3,It put me to sleep!!,"I should have bought this [junk] used and you should too, that's if you can find it for a cheaper price.It was okay, but not worth the price it's selling for..."
4,Excellent,This movie was given to me for Christmas. Some of the scenes they picked were a little weak but I loved the trailers at the end & seeing all the different characters. Recommended for any horror fan.
5,IN THE PINK,Used these for the first time with my walking DVD this morning and will continue. Easy to hold and just the right addition to my exercise!
5,No Complaints!,"These are great quality and are getting a lot of use. I definately have no complaints, I love these little weights!"
4,Too light,"Its too light and is good for kids or teens I guess, definitely not for a grown up. Its feather light."
4,Does the job,I use these dumbbells for Jillian Michael's workouts and don't have any problem with them. I took off one star because I think the Valeo brand logo printed on one side of the dumbbell is kind of ugly. It's not a deal breaker though I wish the dumbbell weight is printed on both sides of the dumbbell.
4,2 pound Neoprene Hand Weights,"Purchased these due to shoulder injury , just the right weight, happy with my purchase, just need to use them more!"
4,Very good quality,"Very good value, it worths the money. I rate 4 stars because it doesn't have the option to pick the different color . Other than that perfect."
5,Exactly what I needed,The weights are perfect for what I need. The coating makes them easier to grip and more comfortable to hold. I have fairly small hands and have no problems. I also use them as pushup stands to take pressure off my wrists.
5,Perfect grip,Exactly as I expected. Great for upper body work and comes with a poster to help you with specific exercises.
4,How much can you say about these?,"What can I say...they're weights. They're blue. They weigh about 5 lbs each.Bought these to supplement physical therapy for rotator cuff tendonitis. Likes - comfortable grip, neoprene avoids having to pickup cold steel. Dislikes - price more expensive than they should have been (reason for 4 vs 5 stars) Other uses - great doorstop, paperweight, many more..."
4,Accurate and durable weight,"This is an accurate and durable weight. I have read numerous articles about free weights being off. I weighed mine and they were accurate. The only thing that kept them from getting five stars is that they are on the bulky side likely due to the neoprene coating. I am female 5'7"" with long thin fingers. If my fingers were not on the longer side it may be hard to grip these well. They work for me, but I would be careful if you have tiny hands."
4,Ok,these work great and were made for small hands which I have but for some of the things I was doing with the weights it would have been nice if they where a bit longer
5,great set of weights,"I looked at similar weights at Dick's Sporting Goods and after sifting through about 12 pairs, went home empty-handed because each and every weight had a lot of dings and dents in the neoprene. I think it was from being hung on metal racks in the store. I got home and decided to try looking on Amazon. I ordered these 8 lb weights which turned out to be about $5 cheaper than the ones at Dick's, and they are awesome. I still can't get over the mint condition they are in. No scratches or tears. I wanted to start out with brand new weights (no dings) because I know that with neoprene weights a small tear can quickly become large and big chunks can rip off over time. Another very good feature about these weights is that there are small straight edges on each side of each circle which prevent them from rolling away. Also, the color red is lovely. Satisfactory purchase all around!"
5,Great Little Weights!,"I ordered these hand-weights, and they are just perfect. I had hoped that they weren't too light. Since some 2lb hand-weights actually seem to weigh more or less then other hand-weights(Odd, I know). They were packaged well and covered in thick plastic to protect it's texture. These are nice and have a nice texture that makes them easy to hold during longer periods of time. I use them during my exercises or even just sitting at my desk for little extra toning. Very happy with my purchase."
4,weighty weights,"The items were as advertised. However, either I didn't read carefully or it wasn't clearly stated, but I ordered (2), thinking I would get 2 handweights. Instead I got two pairs of handweights, and had to return one pair."
3,no frills hand weights,"I like the texture of these weights--they don't feel like they'll ever slip out of your hands. Other than that, they're just your regular 10-pound hand weights!"
4,Jane's hand weights for Video,These weight's are just right for these video's they are not to heavey and they don't hurt to hold them. As you get stronger you can get a higher hand weights but these are good to start off with.
4,fast shipping and good quality,"these were shipped to me very quickly and are decent quality for the price. i use them everyday and they have not worn, or gotten dirty and gross like my other weights"
4,Great value,These weights are a great value for the money. My only complaint is that they get slippery toward the end of my workout. I'm constantly wiping my hands in the middle between sets. Gloves might be the answer to my problem but wanted to share it anyway.
4,Good product with reasonable price,"The first thing that I like most about this dumbbells is the price that is reasonable compared to the other dumbbells sets sold on Amazon. I was not sure when I ordered whether it would be a good quality dumbbells because the price is relatively cheaper that the other brands. However, once I got them, I think they looked really fine. I cannot see any difference of this set of dumbbells from the other brands which I bought before and more expensive. The only one comment that I have for this dumbbell set is that there is a small bump at the end of each dumbbell which I am sure that it was not the design, but some defect from manufacturing process. Although I don't like this small defect much, it does not bother my workout at all. So, so far I rated this dumbbell four stars."
3,it works,"Been using it to work out everyday. The handle is slightly more thick than I would like. The surface is not perfectly polished. But hey, it is just weight, as long as I can hold it and move it around, i am happy."
5,Excellent weights,These weights are pretty to look at and comfortable to hold. They can be left out in a rec room and add to the decor too.
4,Just the right size,"I ordered two sets of these for my mom and my wife. Both have loved them. They are the right size for what they want to do with them. In addition, they arrived in a timely manner and undamaged."
5,Great for getting started.,"These are easy to grip and use, and just the right weight for me to get started. With my small hands, the seam is not really a problem, I just make sure my palms are on the opposite side. The weights have notched outer edges that keep them from rolling when put down. The color is really nice too. Would highly recommend for any woman looking to start with weight training."
5,Great weights,Weights are easy to handle. Slip resistant when your hands get sweaty. Worth every penny.
4,3-Pound Neoprene hand weights,Good quality and excellent price. They are comfortable and exactly what I was looking for my upper body exercises.
5,Great hand weights.,"These hand weights are made well and balanced well. I have the 5 pound and 8 pound and as soonas I can do it, I'll be purchasing the 10 pound Valeo Neoprene hand weights. I highly recommendthem!"
4,satisfied,"Great product, feels secure in hand,shipped and arrived quickly.The only drawback Ive found was on the heads of the dumbells is a small bump where a screw or something is under the coating,and it appears this would be the 1st place to wear thru.being careful how you put these down should take care of that"
1,Bad Quality,"I ordered these weights in December 2011, both the 10 lb and the 8 lb. The 8 lb weights immediately started shedding the neoprene coating. Every time I see them, more and more looks like it's coming off, and I hate to use them because they are a mess to look at, not to mention the coating it leaves all over the floor. This started happening a few months later w/the 10 lbs weights. I do not do anything weird to them. They just sit there when not in use. I would return them but can't imagine what it would cost to return 36 lbs of weights....Just recommend buyhing something else. I'll probably have to replace these soon."
5,Great product 8 pounds each,"These are the greatest weights to add to your collection. They won't roll and the rubber material coating is great. I lift them over my head about one hundred times a night, that's like lifting eight hundred pounds. I feel marvelous."
5,"A compelling, informative, and gripping autobiography","The newest addition to ""The Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime and Law"", Listening To Olivia: Violence, Poverty, And Prostitution by Jody Raphael (Senior Research Fellow, DePaul University College of Law's Schiller, DuCanto and Fleck Family Law Center) is the personal story of Olivia, a woman who spent nineteen years of her life as a stripper, a prostitute, and a heroine addict. She left a troubled home at 16 and became involved in Chicago's subculture of prostitution, drug addiction, and abusive men. A resourceful woman of color, Olivia was able to eventually break with ""the life"" and now works to support drug-dependent women. Especially commended to the attention of students of Urban Sociology and Women's Studies, Listening To Olivia is a compelling, informative, and gripping autobiography that uniquely illuminates the life led by low-income, non-white, young women in commercial prostitution today."
4,Great ideas!,"some of these things I've already done with my kids, however, there are lots of things I never thought of doing with them."
5,Hamster palace,"My hamsters truly enjoy this habitat, they love sleeping in the penthouse and they seem to really enjoy running in this big wheel. great product."
1,The wheel will drive you nuts!!,"The wheel design (round tube outside of cage) is TERRIBLE. I don't think they ever tested this on a live hamster. Our hamster decided that would be the ideal place to nest AND run. The sound of hamster food, hamster droppings and shavings being slung around is worse than a handful of gravel in your clothes dryer! We had to put a stick through the opening of the wheel to lock it in place and give her a smaller wheel inside the cage to run. We will sometimes 'unlock' that wheel so that she can run in it while we aren't home to hear it... it slings hammy 'filth' in about a 3 foot radius. We are very disappointed. No matter how many times we dump and clean the wheel (no easy task as it doesn't fully disassemble...) she isn't discouraged from nesting there."
1,Messy and easy to escape from,We thought this cage looked fun for our newest pet. It is horrible! He poops in the wheel and then when he runs poop flies everywhere. The wheel is also very noisy. We had hoped to move the hamster into our daughters room but the noise would keep her up all night. The hamster has figured out how to open the door to the look-out room and escape. We now have it taped shut with mailing tape. After 3 escapes it is time for us to find a new cage.
1,Worst Cage EVER!!!,"Do not buy this cage! It is a piece of garbage. Upon assembly, the entire top cracked. Every time I clean it, a new piece breaks. The wheel is impossible to clean, as it does not come apart so waste collects and you will spend a great deal of time swirling water through it trying to get it clean to no avail. The sky tower does not fasten properly and your hamster will escape. Petco and all other sellers should be embarrassed to actually be taking money for such a piece of junk! Shame on all of them for continuing to sell such a poor quality product."
3,It's okay.,"My hamster tends to sleep and store her food up in the Ferris wheel area. She also urinates in it, which makes a mess in the wheel and the area underneath it with slit is on the roof area. The wheel cannot be cleaned easily. I tried to disassemble, but after hearing a cracking noise, I decided to stop for fear of breaking the connections. All I can do is rinse with soap and water and use a blow dryer on low setting to help dry it out. I wouldn't recommend it due to the Ferris wheel being hard to clean."
1,Hamsters get stuck in wheel!,"We have several plastic hamster habitats and this by far is the worst. We have 2 hamsters and neither can get out of the wheel once they get in. They will try and try, but just can't pull themselves up the tube. We have a robo, and a dwarf hamster, so maybe if you had a larger one it could get out, Also, as has been stated in other reviews, the wheel is impossible to clean. You have to soak it in the tub to actually get it clean. Right now we are looking to buy another cage for ours."
2,Not the best cage to be found,"This cage is very cute and appealing to the eye, but cleaning it is strenuous. Assembly is simple because everything snaps tightly together, but for this same reason, disassembling it to clean it is difficult. I haven't broken the pieces just yet, but I have broken several fingernails instead.Also, the wheel attachment does not seem very well thought out. As the hamster runs in it and goes to the bathroom in it (because all hamsters do), it gets very dirty but does not come apart enough for thorough cleaning. That, and the sound of hamster droppings clinking in it is enough to drive a person insane.Perhaps other Crittertrail cages would be a better choice, because I do understand the allure of the expansion kits and universal connectors for future renovation."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR HAMSTER TO GET OUT,"This cage is horrible, I should've listened to the other reviews - the lazy lookout is too easy for a hamster to get out of - even after duct taping the lid shut, my daughters teddy bear hamster still managed to pop the entire top half off and escape. She is heartbroken. Do not get this please!"
4,Great for pets who need exercise!!!,"I purchased this cage a few days ago because my gerbil had been living in a really small cage with almost no accessories, I work full time so the little guy was getting fat and lazy. For the first two days he wouldn't leave the wheel, but since he's figured it out he's all over. I've never seen him so active. I would rather clean his wheel everyday to get his droppings out than have a fat/lazy gerbil that could have obesity problems and die. I would recommend to anyone who wants their pet to get exercise."
1,Worst cage ever,"I now own this cage and I have experienced the most horrible memories with this cage. This cage looks appealing but my hammy has gotten out of this cage not once but twice. My hamster got out because it could open the cage from the inside, not a secure door! Also I have broke the wheel just trying to open the wheel to clean it which is also very flimsy. It is very very hard to clean"
3,Could be better,"This cage is nice because we can actually see our pet hamster, and he loves the house. Unfortunately it is very flimsy. The ladders are constantly falling, and when you reach in to put them back then the ""floors"" on the other levels fall."
2,Cute but....yeah.....,"I received a hamster last Friday and got this cage along with it. The wheel is impossible to clean and when she goes to the bathroom in it, it clanks around there with her. You can't take the wheel apart for a thorough cleaning. She is also able to get out of the ""lookout"" area. She discovered this last night by pushing her head up and unclasping the top of it. I found her happy as can be on the floor! Going to Petsmart tonight to look for another cage. Also the tubes are very hard to connect together. Overall it's spacious and cute, just not thought out very well."
1,UGH!,"This cage is horrible. Our daughters hamster has gotten out of the top look out tower twice. We had to rubber band the clip so she couldnt bite and push it open, THEN she pushed the entire top off! We had to purchase a different piece to use there....expensive and NOT easy to find.Secondly to clean this stupid wheel is IMPOSSIBLE. The little critter runs and pees and poops, so you have urine all through the wheel PLUS the joy of listening to the clinking of hamster poop bouncing all through the wheel. To clean it you have to use a screw driver to pry the plastic pieces apart, completely take it apart and wash....then allow to dry. Meanwhile there is no way to close off the hole so the hamster cant get out. AND because the wheel is on top of the cage there is pee dripping down onto the cage as well as whatever the cage is on......gross.I would keep looking."
3,Impossible mission.,Short novel of the struggle of a pair heroes battling the power of the galactic empire.
4,Amazing story and writing,"I could not put this book down. The story is so grisly and yet told without any sentimentality or self-pity. The writing is excellent. I ended the book full of admiration for the writer who came off as brave and very, very smart. A real artist. A beautiful and sometimes shocking book."
5,ideal desk lamp and good value,"I bought this lamp after searching at WalMart, Staples, and a couple of other stores. I was looking for a desk lamp with plenty of light to replace an incandescent desk lamp that created too much heat in my office where I have two computers running all day. While I was somewhat put off by the high shipping costs, when purchased through Amazon it was still more economical than the lamps I had looked at locally. It has been perfect. It is large enough to provide all the light I need for my large corner desk and it has useful holders for pens, tape, post-its, paperclips, etc. I received my order quickly and it was packed so as to insure there was no damage. In summary, it has exceeded my expectations. The lamp is more useful and was less expensive (even with $11 shipping costs) than any product I was able to find locally."
3,Intressting.. but old news today!,This book is quite old and the facts that is presented is today old news.. but still i find this book a interesting read!
1,Do not buy this book!!,"Very shallow, basically covers how to walk through a few wizards and I'm disgusted trees were wasted in this effort."
2,Misrepresented by the title,I found this book to be very lacking and costing me more time than its worth. 'From the Ground UP' should mean just that. This is not from the ground up. I find that I am constantly having to do my own research in the Microsoft help in order to get the examples to work...way too many gaps in the text and bugs in the examples. I'm an experienced C++ programmer (but not Visual) and struggled with this book's lack of detail.
3,Practice From the Gound Up,"If you are looking for something practical with Visual C++ 6, it is the one of candidates. The structure of this book is well defined. You will experience a lot of new features of Visual C++ 6 though the straightforward sample applications. This book covers some topics, like ADO data binding, which you properly just see a brief instruction on many C++ books, in detail. It also explores Internet development hands-on experience and tools. In the last chapter it talks about how to package your application in most developers' interest. The main drawback for this book is that the code is not well-tested. For instance, the code on P210 will encounter runtime error. Another problem is that it has little explanation for window programming architecture and you don't expect you can ask ""whys"" in therory."
3,Good in some aspects but need cover more,"This book is good for reader to learn Database, Html, Software Package with hands-on instruction plus information guidance. But you hardly get instruction for other purposes, e.g. graphics etc. The source code privided need improvement."
4,Nostalgia Lane,"Terrific DVD purchase. I bought this DVD set for: ""What a Nightmare Charlie Brown,"" a rare show that I recall from my elementary school days. In this episode (which I only recall seeing twice on TV), Snoopy has a ""Call of the Wild"" experience as an Alaskan sled dog. My 5 and 6 year old boys absolutely loved it. They also giggled and squealed their way through ""Charlie Brown's First Kiss"" and are big fans of the other episodes. Well worth the money. Good family fun for all."
5,Revies,I am a big fan of Peanuts. This is the second volume of the 1970's set. It is well worth buying and keeping.
3,Beautiful box/ not safe for the dvds,"This Dvd set is amazing. Beautifully built, but the package is not usable and even though they were new when I got it, the dvds (1st and 2nd seansons) were damaged and full of scratches, which was a turn down. I had to clean it with a cleaning solution before use it and buy a dvd case to put them all in, 'cause the original box could scratch them even more. Sad."
1,Loved the box set,"Woww the package looks nice, but after the Complete 3rd Season on DVD I became dissapointed about the DVD realeses, just didn't like the new music, could TPTB notice that all the Creek fans ( Creekers, which I'm proudly part of) loved not only the whole story but also the music , the only way to buy this set will be that the episodes were just like the ones airing on the reruns."
4,"Love the series, hate the packaging","Dawson's Creek has always been one of my favorite series. It's melodramatic, but quite moving at the same time.I appreciated it being so cheap. That's the reason I bought it. I am disappointed that, yet again, Columbia has cheaped out on their packaging of a series. Two cheap plastic spindles with the discs just stacked. But if that's what it takes for the series to be so cheap, then I can deal with it."
5,Just as I remember...,"I read other reviews and was somewhat hesitant to order, but glad that I did. The shows are exactly as I remember with all the original songs. Definitely worth the price."
5,Awesome!,So happy to have the series together as one set. I love this show!! It is such a classic for me. I love watching this show...it just makes me happy.
5,Great show ... nice that the complete series is all together but what about Blu Ray or Digital copies?,"I rated this 5 stars because the show is so great that I think it is worth buying, either as a complete set or individual seasons. I have all the seasons in the original release boxes but as I have watched these dvds over and over they are starting to show wear and I would like to replace my entire collection. I have held off because I am hoping these will either come out on Blu Ray or with a digital copy option for my ipod, as I would love to have my Dawson's creek with me wherever I go. If you loved the show like I did, you will not be disappointed with buying them on dvd to enjoy over and over."
5,Love it!,Love it! Just wish it was packaged a little different but that doesn't make that big of a difference! Worth the price for sure!!
3,Dawsons creek series,I am enjoying the show. Never watched it when it was on tv. Some of the DVDs have bad voice over but all in all a good show
4,Nice boxset,"I love dawsons creek and have watched the series countless times. My individual season boxsets over many years of use were missing their booklets and some of the dvds were scratched. I bought his item to replace my current boxsets and I am very pleased with the product. Many customers reviews mentions the dvd packaging, which I agree could be improved. I did not experience glue or scratches on the dvds but they are very snug in their sleeve and take a little more work to get out. But otherwise I like the layout of the boxset. Includes episode descriptions, pictures, and cast info. Takes up much less room on the shelf that 6 individual boxsets. I am happy to have the entire series all together."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was so excited to see the entire series for such a great price but you truly do get what you pay for. The packaging is minimal, which I did sort of expect. My main complant is that some of the episodes wont play. It just gets stuck on the copyright warnings, shows warning one then two then back to one then two again, continually. Its done this on at least one episode of most of the disks and I haven't quite found a way around the season 2 disk I'm currently on. I noticed in a couple season 1 episodes the lighting and coloring changed so much from camera to camera within the same scene. Most is minor considering the price but episodes not playing is a deal breaker. Anyone else experience this crazy loop phenomenon?"
2,Packaging looks nice.......,It's a great show that I've enjoyed watching with my daughter and niece. The packaging totally sucks. Most of the disc are stuck in by the glue holding the pages together. Almost every disc has a scratch from removing it! I had to buy a cd holder to store them in. The price is better then buying the seasons individually but I hope I can get them all out so we can finish!
3,Spindle,"The packaging was really second-rate; just a spindle with the DVDs stacked, and no episode guide was included. The price was comparatively low, but I still feel a little gypped."
4,Bought it as a Gift -- Friend is Happy,"I bought this as a gift (it was the only thing my friend wanted for Christmas!) a little leary since some reviews said there were some packaging and music quality issues, but, when the discs arrived and my friend started watching the discs she didn't care-- she said the dvds were great and she was happy to again watch one of her favorite tv shows from start to finish. Thanks! Packaging and music/disc quality was great, no problems here."
5,Dawson's Creek was a great series full of teen angst,"Dawson's Creek was one of my favorite series. I loved watching these kids grow up and become young adults. When Katie Holmes was a teen before she met Tom Cruise, she was your girl next door with a good head on her shoulders. The characters don't talk like teens but they are witty and well thought out. I own 2 full TV series and this is one of them. Joshua Jackson is adorable! James Van DerBeek is well... Dawson and the other characters like Michelle Williams are wonderful and I love them."
3,Dawson's Creek,"I was overall satisfied with the purchase. I wish the cd's would have been individually protected, they are all together and could get easily scratched. I am most disappointed with the fact that the main song (Sarah McLachlan) isn't on this. The music has been taken off."
5,don't listen to the bad reviews...,Yes i know the original songs were removed.but that's the only thing wrong.other than that its a amazing set.great boxset.discs come on top of eachother but no scratches.i got this as a first time fan.buy this.
3,Perfect for Chris Atkins Fans,"Rather lame plot.... but who cares? Chris gives fans 'everything' they want, by providing a frontal shot, and lots of buns. Wow!"
4,A night on earth,"What I liked about this ""B"" movie is that the characters were so ""ordinary.""He: Shallow, not so smart poor boy with not much to offer the world but good looks and lack of sexual inhibitions.She: Neglected wife, school teacher, female puts down macho student in class.Student sees opportunity to take her down sexually and does.Not a nice guy, but how many people are nice? Vulnerable wife, and how many people are vulnerable?A lot of nice people get hurt by others who are not evil, necessarily but only shallow, and often shallow and bitter.Husband: A sympathetic character.Much better than most low-budget and yet non-""art"" films."
3,A Night of Lust,"Woo. This ultra steamy film was just the motivation we needed to go see a male revue of our own. Lesley does a wonderful job of playing the demure Faye while Atkins rocks as the baby face stud she decides to ""take on."" In any effect, with all the fantasy being lived out, we are given a true taste of what also happens due to extramarital affairs. While out on a boat, Faye's husband gives ""Rickie the Rocket"" a good reason to keep his pants zipped up."
4,Wow-Wee,"I personally liked the movie.Chris Atkins is incredibly sexy even without the Blue Lagoon hair. If you're into the Lifetime-type movies about extramarital or student-teacher affairs, this is one for you."
3,This movie to watch only because of Lesley Ann Warren,"Most of the movies that Lesley Ann Warren is in are terrible. Terrible script, terrible acting and so on. But you have to hand it to Lesley Ann she puts her entire self into the rolls she plays. She makes them come alive she makes the viewer to want to fisnsh watching the movie to find out what happens to her chacater.""A Night in Heaven"" is no expection.THREE CHEERS FOR LESLEY ANN WARREN. She will be rememered."
4,YUMMY!,"One of the hottest movies I've seen, without being crass. Sensual, sexy, and something that alot, (can't say every, of women would want. Highly recommended!! Have fun ladies *wink"
2,A Forgotten Camp Classic,"The premise of this movie is too hoaky to be believed, isn't it? Christopher Atkins, known best as Richard from The Blue Lagoon, makes some smart remark in class and has his teacher fail him. His teacher, Lesley Ann Warren, goes out with some friends to see some male strippers and - surprise! - HE is one of them. Then they have an affair.I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry. Half of me is convinced that this is all just some weird dream and no one actually put this on paper, let alone made a whole movie out of this. The other half of me is disgusted with whoever gave this the go ahead. It's just too hilarious to believe, but it's real. Recommend it? Well, I guess I could. If you're looking for something campy and silly, it's certainly that. Sure, have fun with it."
4,The Psychology of Pederasty,"In one word, this movie is about the effect, especially the psychosexual effects, of pederasty. In this case, it is incestuous pederasty. [Check one of the on-line dictionaries if you are unfamiliar with this word.] When the father tried to cover up his past, all sorts of things backfire on him and, even worse, for his son.This is a very psychological movie, if you understand it. It must have been written by a victim, now grown, to have such a strong impact."
4,Just fine,They took a while longer to ship than expected but other than that they were what I needed.This sucks that you have to have a certain amount of word to write a review
3,"Great art, interesting creatures, horrible editting","Yes, the artwork is really great in this book, but while the book does have an editor listed, I am not sure anything more than a spell check was performed.There are TONS of instances where typos got by the spell check because they resulted in real words that were inappropriate to the current context. Maybe it's just me, but typos like this detract from the professionalism of a book.Unfortunately this seems to be par-for-the-course for TSR lately."
3,Old adversaries,This is good jor the experieced D.M. to find those creatures that have yet to be reincarnated int the newest versions of the D&D system.
5,Top Rate Universal TV Western With Memorable Cast.,"Don't compare this to the James Stewart version. Take it for what it is, an entertaining Universal TV Western from 1967. I had been after this film for over twenty years and finally, thanks to Timeless Media Group, we have another exceptional print. The enthusiastic cast is headed by Tom Tryon, Dan Duryea and the always reliable JOHN SAXON. Mr Saxon chews the secenery and his character exudes menace from his first appearance to his last. Also in the cast John Drew Barrymore, Joan Blondell, John Dehner, Barbara Luna, Paul Fix, John Doucette, Jack Lambert, Jan Arvan, Ned Romero, George Keymas, Robert Bice, David Pritchard and John Hoyt!Another thing I neglected to mention in previous reviews...Timeless Media Group always have excellent cover art and a nice collection of stills from the films and the price is very reasonable. Keep up the goood work Timeless Media Group!"
3,Pretty good movie,"This movie is a good T.V. remake of 1950 motion picture that starred Jimmy Stewart, it is not a great film , but it is a good entertaining movie with a simple plot like a lot of good westerns. One thing I like is how they made the changes to the story for this remake. it expaneded the Mcadams family from two brothers in the original film to a complicated somewhat disfunctional family of 5 members here. Which works into this plot very well. This movie is well worth the low price."
1,Winchester 73 1967 Edition..,"I will three things about this movie... SAVE YOUR MONEY... this movie is nothing like the 1950 edition, Jimmy Stewart is great in the 1950 movie of winchester 73. Buy them both, and I think you will see what I did, I wanted the 1967 edition to see how close it was to the 1950 edition, not even close. I would not rate the 1967 edition at even one star..."
5,Wunderbar!!,"I bought this CD just days after seeing the show in New York (with the incomparable Ms. Mazzie and Mr. Mitchell) and the CD is sooo close to impeccably recreating the theater experience.While the recording of ""I Hate Men"" is fabulous, it can't quite match the comedic timing and sheer vocal power of Marin Mazzie on stage.If you can't get to the Martin Beck, this is the next best thing."
5,Raoul du Valle,"Having several versions of Kiss me Kate this one is by far the best recording. It is fresh and alive bubling with vitality. I just wish that I could see the show, but having the C.D. is the next best thing. If you like Cole Porter buy this version, the best!"
5,It's WUNERBAR!,"I have never seen this musical, not yet, but I love the music! I love Cole Porter's music. If you like Broadway show tunes, by this CD! And for thoes of you who don't know about Kiss Me, Kate, it's based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" and the song ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"" is worth buying this CD! The music is just fun and nice to listen to."
5,A huge sigh of pleasure...,"I saw the show on Broadway a mere five times, so I simply had to get the CD which I awaited most impatiently. The four leads were absolutely fabulous, especially Amy Spangler as Lois Lane -- Always True to You and Tom, Harry, or Dick are sheer delight to listen to. The orchestra was also marvelous! The older versions sound so dated and wooden, but this one was divine!"
5,"Run, don't walk to buy this CD!","This is a fantastic recording of a wonderful, delightful show! However there are certain songs on the CD that just can't compare to seeing them on stage, such as Mazzie's show-stopping rendition of ""I Hate Men"" or Berresse's dazzling rendition of ""Bianca"", Porter's weakest song but a true gem in this production.Marin Mazzie is the best soprano on Broadway and her version of ""So In Love"" should be played right now on the adult contemporary radio stations. BSM is just as powerful and spectacular in this show as he was in Ragtime. He has so many wonderful solos that are captured beautfully on this recording.The orchestrations in the show and on this CD are top notch and makes one wish that we could go back in time to live through the golden age of Broadway.Buy it!"
4,"Great Music, Cole!","I have long been a fan of this musical. The plot is truly unique, the humorous characters never cease to make me laugh and the music is fabulous. I think the listeners will be pleased to hear the diversity of singing style that Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie demonstrated in this show. Every other singer is great for their role as well. Two thumbs up from me!!!"
2,"""Kate"" doesn't Sing.","I read several lukewarm reviews of this CD, thinking that I would feel differently -- how wrong I was.I saw this production on B'Way -- and while it isn't exactly fresh, it made up for its staleness with pure old fashioned B'Way showbiz schmaltz -- lively performances, and enthusiastic orchestrations provided for a fun and snappy experience.Sadly, none of it translates onto the CD. Even with the immensely talented cast, the cd sounds at worst limp and choppy, and at best, merely adequate -- Even the showstopers come across as perfunctory (and with this show, that's saying something!)I'm sure there is an amazing recording of this show. The 1999 cast album isn't it."
3,"Excellent, but...","I thought this was great, I love this musical, however, the only flaw I noticed was in ""Another openin'"" seemed to be a little high in range for atleast one of female cast members in parts. But it doesn't detract from the performance too badly."
5,Southern Gospel Treasures,This CD will make you feel joy and weep before it is all over it really touches the heart. I may have to send to my Mom for I know she will love it too.
1,sentimiento andino 2,This is the great CD of the popular south american music; Kjarcas is the group more representative of the incas music
3,A little cheesy,"Without even comparing this book to one of Jane Austen's it still came up wanting. I wanted to like the characters but had a hard time identifying with them. I am single in my 20's and kept thinking that the characters were just a little too cheesy to be real.It was nice, however, to read a book that was ""clean"" through and through."
3,"Several mistakes, and disappointing heroine","I love the idea of modern-day Austen novels, and this was okay, but could've been better. I like the hero much better than the heroine. She was immature and sort of annoying. I also found a couple grammatical errors (spelling, missing words/letters, added words/letters, etc) that distracted me."
5,The Mood Setter...,This is definitely a CD for couples or someone you want to have a special night with-lol! The Isley's DEFINITELY will add to your night to remember!!
5,Great R&B Oldies Love Songs...,"This takes me waaaay back; a must have for holidays, cook-outs; anytime we want to listen to music from ""back in the day"". Even the young people enjoy these songs!"
3,Love Songs are back,This is not one of the greatest Love songs CDs I think there are many more beautiful love songs that could have been included on this CD. Of causes these are top class musicians and they can really make an ordinary song sound good.But the collection for me is not out of this world but ok for the fans.
4,Quiet Storm,"The Isley Brothers are one of the hottest R&B groups out there. I've known about this group since the early 80s, when my uncle had a cassette tape of an Isley Bros. album that I also have on CD. Again, I love old school, and I love the Isley Brothers."
2,Doesn't really work,These filters did not control the litter box smell very well. There was no difference after I added the filter...
5,Great for cutting down on odors,"We have two cats and the booda clean step is great for keeping the floors clean and the kitty smell inside the litter box. You can tell when the filter needs to be changed(after about two months) but the day after you change it the smell goes away.My estimated delivery date was the 1st of June, but I got it 27th of May, just two days after purchase. Great seller!"
2,booda filters,they are not worth the cost. The filters do not stay inside the booda and the cat scratches holes into the filter and litter is every where.
4,A great show,"All great episodes. Another great Andromeda collection.""Ouroboros"" is probably the best episode on these DVD's. The main reason is the new Trance. I liked the old Trance, but the future Trance is so much better. I was kind of getting tired of the purple look."
3,Great words on Genesis 3,"In general, Bonhoeffer's comments on chapters 1-2 are extremely philosophical, abstract, and largely unhelpful. But his work on Genesis 3 is worth the price of the book. Good resource for preachers preparing sermons on Genesis."

3,Not for Children,"An astonishing and disquieting little fairy tale, Une tetede chien was first published in Paris in 1951. It is the story of ahuman boy born with the head of a spaniel dog. One would think the story would have to be either satirically funny or sadly pathetic. I found it to be more a fable of acceptance. How young Edmond, the dog-headed boy, grows to manhood and encounters (and endures) various prejudices and cruel jokes is a moral unto itself. Although a fantasy, this is not a book for children. It is a rather disturbing and thought-provoking story about being different in a world where conformity prevails."
2,Narration,"Reading is better, unless you want to be normal. Ninety percent may find this voice fine. No good for this-"
4,Gracefulness!!!,"An inspiring colorful story of majesty and beauty. This miracolous story filmed at the unique desolate Lake Natron, in Northern Tanzania, showcases an upclose look at these elegant, noble birds in their natural environment, unfolding; the birth, life, and survival of a million crimson winged flamingos.I appreciate nature docummentaries for showing me exactly what animals go through to survive in their natural habitat. While this film is appropiate for family of all ages, you may want to prepare your young children that nature's life cycle isn't always fair.The music in combination with the film is breathtaking. No comment on the narration. This story is amazing as it is beautiful!!!!!!"
1,Not so good,"While I understand that death needs to be addressed, I feel like I learned more about how flamingos die than how they live. We bought it for our children (ages 5 and 7) and had them sit and watch it with us. They cheered when it was over."
1,Big letdown,"I had just read ""The Threat"", and picked up ""Alien Agenda"" to get a different perspective.Unfortunately, this book quickly fell into the worst of conspiracy fluff. Starting with the notion that the moon is a hollow spaceship that was sent through space billions of years ago, this book threw every outrageous claim together in one book. Some claims even conflicted. For example, the ""Greys"" are either from Pleiades or Zeta Reticuli or Mars. All three are claimed in the book.The book was also riddled with typos, including one in the very first paragraph, and ended with a re-hash of the authors ""Rule By Secrecy"" book, in which the Federal Reserve is really just a conspiracy platform created by the richest of European banking interests.A real dud."
4,A real Ufo investigation,"This book is one of the more complete journalistic reportage I ever read about Ufo. In my opinion Marrs has made a very interesting overview about what all we know about the supposed alien phenomenon in earth. I am only rather puzzled about the territoriality faced by this book. I mean that Ufo issue is quite spreads all over the planet, so to write meanly about what is going on only in the States, to me is a reductive point of view. But, of course, that's could be an author's choice."
2,Unforgivably Sloppy,"Shame on me for buying this book new. I'm only a third of the way into it and already the mounting errors and weak citations are causing me to consider tossing it. See Marrs' introductory section to find the Aurora, TX airship incident occurring on April 17. Or is it April 19? I don't know because both dates are given within three pages -- whatever happened to proofreading?! And constant referencing of UFO Magazine or anything by von Daniken is the surest ways to gut your credibility. Jim Marrs is a journalist? Really?Reservedly, I do admit to enjoying the tales I'd never heard before, such as the thing in the icy New Hampshire pond and the hollow Moon evidence. Intriguing nuggets in an otherwise laughable book."
3,"Yes, the moon does rotate!!","It was a great read, but the science is faulty. According to my high school physics teacher and a geophysicist I know at the Univ. of Alaska, the moon does rotate around its axis, just like the earth. I wish all of these ufo experts would get that right, it makes them all look like fools."
3,Investigation is evenly reported/written,"Most of the subjects covered in Jim Mars book have been covered more thoroughly elsewhere, therefore, do not come to this book expecting to be enlightened or, if you are a researcher, to gain new information. Mr. Mars never really provides the ""alien agenda"" in any specific way. It is simply alluded to, as in so many other books. Apparently, he finally gives up trying to provide the ""agenda"" and instead gives us words from the ""galactic command"" as the ending for the book - new age type rhetoric on just ""getting along with each other"" and ""saving the environment."" If you are looking for a good book as background research, don't waste your time with this one."
5,"Comprehensive, open-minded and mind-opening. . .","I read this book during a cross-country drive that took me through Roswell and up past Area 51 in Nevada. So perhaps my mind was fertile to receive the incredibly comprehensive treatment of UFOs and related materials that Marrs gives in Alien Agenda. Suffice it to say, though, that the book produced an exciting sense of the POSSIBLE plausibility of a (to me) new vision of the world as a far stranger place than I had ever imagined. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be lifted out of the groove of normal, everyday experience."
5,AN EYE OPENER----!!!!!,"Once again, Mr. Marrs is on the money. Step by step, he takes you through the history of this subject to our present day. It's another piece of our planets' puzzle that people need to understand. Read carefully with an open mind. There were things that I knew about all ready with other research I've done. This work only made it better. Mr. Marrs is right, the Aliens would never hurt us. Disclosure would mean massive change, perhaps helping humanity take it's place amongst the intergalactic federation as it were."
4,Excellent Primer on UFOs,"A good starting point for people getting into the UFO phenomenon. Jim Marrs offers an almost encyclopediac look at UFOs through the ages, from ancient texts like the Bible all the way up to Roswell and Cydonia. He also gives us a peek into how the US military has dealt with UFOs since the 1940s. This is no sensational book full of crazy stories but a book full of well written research. Jim Marrs leaves it up to the reader whether to believe any of this or not. Read this and Whitley Streiber's Communion and see if you'll still be able to sleep at night."
5,Alien Agenda is a must read - and a great read!,"Whether you believe in UFOs, ancient astronauts and government coverups or not, ""Alien Agenda"" should be on your reading agenda.Marrs is a consummate storyteller, and has gone to great lengths to research the lore of Ufology. Unlike some of the more spaced-out UFO authors, Marrs does not shy away from pointing out inconsistencies and hoaxes. That only made him more believable when he addressed some of the more troubling ET encounters.All in all, a balanced and well-written account which I do not hesitate to recommend to believers and unbelievers alike."
2,Rehash,"This book is a rehash of UFO folklore. The title of the book is misleading because it does not focus on the ""Agenda"". I'm sorry I purchased it."
1,ANOTHER BOOK BY JIM MARRS THAT FLYS,"Alien Agenda and it's importance to the world of UFO's begins immediately with the first chapter. I am not going to tell you about the MOON, but you will find that with the reading, the first chapter is as important as the whole book with extraordinary and almost unbelievable facts to support the revelations Jim presents. As usual in all of Jim Marrs books, his research is mind-boggling with information from many sources, FOIA data, books, other UFO Researchers, and INSIDE sources; but with Alien Agenda, he out-does himself. If you buy this book for just the first chapter, your money will be well spent and you will have a book of historic significance to keep in your library for your children and grandchildren to read many years from now.Just because I have centered on the first chapter only goes to show the reader what to expect from the entire book. After Alien Agenda, I will continue to purchase Jim's books as soon as they hit the bookstores."
1,Marrs Agenda,"This book is a waste of the paper it is printed on. Although Mr. Marrs brings to light a number of inconsistancies in the official reports versus what really happened(according to the participants), Mr. Marrs agenda is to expound on his conspiracy theories about how the Government and the rich are controlling the world. He believes that there are plans to save the top 2% of the country and the world at the time of Armaegeddon and let the remainder of the world die. For a book as well written as this, it is disappointing that the conclusions support the author's bias' instead of suggesting how to further determine the veracity of the reports cited."
1,A disaster,"Someone should write a book about why Marrs continues to write books about things he can't prove. Not only is this badly written, but Marrs does a fabulous job of presenting only 1 side of the argument--his own. ""Witness testimony"" is all fine and dandy, but why is that Marrs can't ever come up with proof for his claims? Oh wait, the U.S. Government covers it all up. Good Lord, do people really buy into that garbage, or do they just want to believe it? The latter is my opinion. Until Marrs can show pictures of these ""aliens"", his arguments will continue to be shot down. Maybe the Majestic 12 has all those aliens over for Sunday dinner, but I suspect the truth lies in the hyperactive imaginations of ""eyewitnesses"" and ""experts""."
3,Mostly a Rehash,"This book, though an interesting overview of UFOs, is mainly a rehash of cases most UFO buffs are very familiar with intermixed with a few interesting tidbits I hadn't heard before. I would be much more likely to recommend this book to someone who is just getting interested in the subject as a jumping off point to research some of the more interesting cases and topics Marrs skims the surface of."
4,Good reading and informative,"Only half way through, although an older book, it's still informative, a bit tedious at times going from one agency to the next and ""trail"" following, but nevertheless, find it captivating."
1,pyrolysis and gasification,"I would love to review this book, if only I had a copy or even access to a copy of same. OK, it's your move!"
3,your web site,"this is the stupidest web site I have ever used, I don't care about wish list I just want to buy an item. I would like to rate your products, but I doubt I will have the patiences to go through all steps just to purchase it."
3,zoli's review,i think this is a good program 2 start on iwht spreed sheets and data bases word prosecing i have used an earlyer version and it works good for me so i hope you like it take my word for it its a good wor prosecing program weather its version 1 234 5 its just plain good
3,No PowerPoint or Publisher :-(,"No point getting this software. Yes word, spreadsheet, database are cool but there is no presentation application. Just would cost me another arm and leg to obtain PowerPoint. If this is ok for you now, fine but what about when you want to advance your skills to learn the basic Office programs other than spreadsheets, database, calendar ...??"
3,Works 6.0 OK but not quite what I expected,"Works 6.0 is a decent value for the money. However, I was disappointed that documents that I previously prepared using a password with Word will not open. I had expected Works 6.0 to have a full Word program but apparently it does not. The word ""password"" does not even appear in the Help index."
3,Good Book but not to be read through,This book is loaded with good philosophy but don't expect to pick it up and read through it. It is comprised of various notes left behind by Nietzsche and that is how they are put in the book. There is very little structure and the entries may seem drawn out and repetitive.
1,This is not a Nietzsche book!,"Think about this, if you want to read ""The Will To Power"": This book is simply a compilation of unused Nietzsche writings done by the philosopher's sister Elisabeth Nietzsche and former intimus Peter Gast. They wanted to transform him into a nationalist, militarist and racist to get more publicity for him. So they falsificated many of his aphorisms he did during 1886 to 1888. This book and ONLY this book made it possible for Nazis to abuse him, the anti-nationalist, the philosemetic and anti-biologist.- Be careful with this book. I agree, it is sad that Nietzsche didn't leave a real ""master work"", so there is only one solution: Read ALL his books, starting with ""The Birth Of Tragedy"", finishing with ""Ecce Homo"". So you can get all the changes and the whole development in his philosophy. So all together, all his books summa sumaris are his ""master work""!"
1,This book is garbage. A horrid waste of time!,"Neitzche disgraced himself. his country, and the human race with his disgusting collection of boring encounters. This disgusting sack of filth that Nietzhe tries to pass off as a book is a comic relief. Shame on him!!!"
4,A Most Unusual Puzzle,"To understand Nietzsche's philosophy one has to have a very alert mind. One has to keep the pieces of the puzzle in the mind's eye at all times. However, with The Will To Power, one may not ever solve the puzzle. From raw Power to Eternal Recurrence, Nietzsche's aphorisms take one throughout his inner universe. A universe that does not have Ariadne's thread to lead us back to some hoped for beginning. Nevertheless, the sheer potence of his emotional impetus, provides one with the building blocks towards his cherished Superman. It is the reader's job, therefore, to use these blocks, and build the bridge himself--an awesome task--which will liberate him from the bonds of anachronisms that are rampant in our ""civilized"" and ""modern"" society"
5,continuation of my recent review,"another thing, this book is just a compilation of his notes for all of his books. The Will to Power is never his magnum opus. If you want to know what it is and what book really comprises most of his philosophy is Thus Spoke Zarathustra.And I quote from him, ""To understand me, one must have read my Zarathustra."""
1,"Inaccurate and misleading, Nietzsche's words twisted","The Will to Power was published by Nietzsche's sister for her own purposes. Nietzsche did not get along with his sister - and for good reason. She was involved with a leading anti-semitic group of that day. Nietzsche painstakingly went over his notes and arranged each aphorism, each word, to be perfect. He was, after all, a professor of Philology. To accept his estranged sister's attempt at arranging and editing his notes into a book is insanity. She had her own agenda which was far from any of Nietzsche's intentions. This book is one of the reasons that Nietzsche got a bad reputation for being anti-semitic and connecting his idea of the ubermensch with Hitler's Master Race.If you do read this book, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the words were his, but not in a form that he would have published."
3,Obsession with Biology and Power,"""The Will to Power"" is a compilation of N.'s notebooks from the last six or seven years of his sane life. This is one of the two books (the other is ""The Anti-Christ"") that the Nazis could put to their own philosophical use. N. continues his interepretation of life a process driven by evolutionary biology, and sees theories about compassion and selflessness as signs of degenration and decay. I found N.'s ideas on the demise of socialism interesting and insightful. But overall he is obsessed with biological factors, what he calls ""life"" and overestimated the detrimental effects of preaching selflessness."
4,You won't sleep through it!,This is a very effective alarm clock and is easy to see from across the room.It has loud and soft settings and bright and dim for the display.This is the second one we bought. My wife wore the alarm on the first one out by letting it go off without shutting it off for hours with nobody home. I assume that's why it quit working.
4,QUALITY HOLDS,"cool holds. they have killer texture so far, and seems like it will last even when they get chalked out. the large set is good for angled walls, tho not too steep. the Patina patterns are similar enough to bishop patina I have seen. sweet holds... climb-it did'm right."
2,Boring tale that even Sarandon and Dreyfuss can't save.,"Susan Sarandon plays a single mom who dates boorish men, Richard Dreyfuss is a school security guard who can't convince his girlfriend to marry him. In an oh-so-predictable plot, Sarandon's son (Wil Wheaton) tries every trick in the book to get them together. Wheaton is obnoxiously whiny, not cute, as the slow moving tale winds its way towards a sappy ending. A few laughs, but not worth the trouble."
4,This Book is Great!!!,"This book is awesome. Complete with strange but true facts. The exclusive DVD is the best, with highlights of Wrestlemanias past it is a must have for any WWF Fan."
4,Langley,This book was purchased for my school library and the children love the series. The book arrived promply and in excellent condition. It went into circulation immediately.
2,Mediocre at best,"This book...was better than the second in that it did a good job of incorperating a well known myth into the plot (Orpheus and Eurydice) However, Jimena (not sure I spelled her name right) is a very flat character. You can tell that this is a woman trying to write a character that is very very far from her own life experience. Jimena's use of slang is forced and unnatural sounding. I don't really sympathize with her. It might have helped if we had had a flashback to the night of Veto's murder.Ewing is not good at making use of her supporting characters in these novels, focusing soley on the character whose point of view we are getting. So then, it seems that those who aren't in focuse act out of character (ie Vanessa getting another boyfriend besides Michael...sure)Maggie is still an annoyingly alusive/all-knowing character."
4,Jimena the love lorn,"Jimena used to be in a gang. That was before she knew she was a daughter of the moon. While in the gang Jimena had a boyfriend called Veto but he died. now back to the present, Veto has come back from the grave. Jimena is so happy until she has a premonition that Veto is in grave danger. Can Jimena Save Veto or does she have to let him go and move on."
5,daughers of the moon: a spellingbinding book!,"Lynne Ewing has a great talent for writing books, I love them! I can only say that you will enjoy it too, a book about magic and a touch of romance, it really gets to you, and you want to keep reading the next book. I have really enjoyed it and I can't wait till i get the next book! To me, it's really about girls having girl power, and surviving the unexpected. They enjoy what they do too, and girls like them just want to have fun."
3,"Sousuke Sagara, super-agent or awkward school boy?","When I first heard about Full Metal Panic I was confused. Was it a giant robot fighting show or a high school love comedy? After watching the first DVD, with the first four episodes, I have to say it is neither - yet. One battle between a 'Arm Slave' - think battle mech - vs a Hind attack helicopter does not a mecha series make. And there seems to be very little going on in the way of a relationship between Sousuke and Kaname Chidori, the special girl, he has to protect.Yet, it did hook me, barely, so I plan to get the second DVD. Because it has some humor, good artwork, interesting weapons and lots of questions it needs to answer. This DVD is for 15 and up, and I suggest getting it used or renting it.I warn you, if the second DVD is not better, I won't be bothering with a review."
5,"Excellent, thought-provoking book!","This is one of the best books I've read so far on this topic. It is short but very insightful, profound and informative. It provides not only the how, but also the why of vegetarianism, including several tasty recipes as an introduction to delicious Indian cuisine. Your life should be changed for the better after reading this book -- and implementing the recommended changes in your diet and lifestyle."
3,Indian food,"I read so many great reviews of this little book, but I have not yet been too impressed with it. Good recipes, but I had hoped for far more Indian recipes than World ones. Nice to have and glad I didn't have to pay a whole lot for"
5,Excellent Book!,An excellent book for anyone considering being a Vegan or wanting to understand why people are Vegan's. Amazing recipes. Just love this book and have been recommending to everyone I know.
4,What a fresh masculine scent,"I ready joy the long lasting lite vanilla, spice citrus and woodsy aroma of this cologne. This cologne works well for day or evening. You will not have to worry about a too powerful fragrance with Pi. One will receive many compliments during the day."
5,what service!,Pi By Givenchy For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 OuncesI placed the order on Tues. 4/7 and it arrived perfect on Wed. 4/8 via UPS. Their service is remarkable. The product is in original wrapping and in mint condition. Excellent timing.
1,Not good,"It is not good product. Original one is amazing but this one smells bad, like fake one. Do not buy it here. Go to the store"
4,Givenchy Pi Review,"It is a cologne that has received much acclaim, and I must say, deservedly. The smell itself is rather easy on the nose, and it does last a while on the body with just three or four sprays. All in all, a great cologne to wear, and definitely one for your personal collection if you are a connoiseur of colognes!"
2,"MOST DEF IT""S FAKE","i have to spray like 3 to four times a day of this to feel it, the smell goes away after an 30 mins.. im so mad and you cann't return it so it sucks i should of went to the mall but guess im to lazy should of read the comments also 02/19/2012."
2,"""Powdery""","I was pretty strongly disappointed with this purchase. I bought it based on the marketing and I suppose that's what I get.My first thought when trying it out the first time was that I smelled like I belonged in a movie about French Nobility in the 1800s.I asked a few of the women I know what they thought of it and it didn't get very good reviews from them. ""Powdery"", ""You smell like twice your age"", ""Smells like grandpa cologne"".It's relatively subtle, and not entirely unpleasant, but it's not the sort of cologne I would wear out on a date or out on the town. I'd really recommend finding a sample first to see if it's the sort of thing you'd like to wear."
1,review,"im not satisfy with this cologne,,wish i could send it back....not satisfy with this product not not satisfy for real"
4,Love the product,This is awesome but bought this as a gift. Somehow in shipping the top plastic gold top got broke but the spray was fine. Think it was a one time fluke and would get again...
5,Pi,i buy his fragrance for myself. i think this scent can be used by both men and women as it is soft and quite nice.
4,Great winter smell,"I love collecting colognes and this is one of my new favorites. Saw it at Macy's for about $75 and came here to buy it for about half the price. It is musky and has a woody, leather, baby powder incense smell to it, if that makes any sense."
5,Pi,Pi is a wonderful fragrance for a man - especially one who loves mathematics. The deal I received through Amazon was especially sweet. It was a perfect Christmas gift for myself.
5,You can almost smell the burning flesh.,"The WarriorAll about a trooper who is the best in his field at killing, but he has one small flaw, he can't follow orders. If you like Drake you can find this novel in an omnibus edition calledCaught In The Crossfire. You , also, get a couple of short stories.Highly recommended for fans of Hammer's Slammers, David Drake, and realistic combat. You can almost smell the burning flesh.Gunner May, 2008"
1,Not what I expected at all,"I always hope with things like this that they are teaching you how to draw scenery. I'm a comic artist, and it's remarkably hard for me to draw the room around me, so I'm always looking for something that will teach me how to just draw that, instead of all these landscape books.This, however, is not it. Don't think that you're getting any sort of lesson here expect for how to place tone sheets.These are pre-drawn scenes that they suggest you CUT OUT and stick in your own comics. My suggestion for those would-be comic artists like myself and so many others? Go get a real drawing book. Like something that doesn't have the word ""Manga"" in the title.The Natural Way to Draw: A Working Plan for Art Studyis a good start that teaches you to draw from life, which is what you're trying to do for scenery anyway! It's also available relatively cheaply, and while it may take some work, all good things do!"
3,"Hey, Caruso can't play guitar...","This incredibly talented guitar slinger came out of the same Tulsa roadhouse RnB scene that spawned Leon Russell. Leon cain't sing very good neither. But boy can Jesse play! Jesse was a mainstay in Taj Mahal's early bands and a much sought after session player. That's part of the problem here. A brilliant studio player cannot neccessarily use his skills in the service of a credible solo effort.So what you've got here is half of England's finest (Clapton, Harrison etc.) jamming with Delaney and the Mad Dog Dominoes.When they stick to trading guitar licks(as on""Every Night.."") the groove is solid. When Jesse forgets he's not Boz Scaggs (as on ""Golden Sun Godess"") it isn't. Still 3 stars ain't bad and fans of Leon Russell, J.J. Cale, and the Tulsa sound in general will be pleasantly surprised. Jesse was a great guitarist and his talents are sorely missed. Here's a good way to get aquainted."
4,Exelente!,"Al escucharlo me senti transportado a mi querida tierra de Chile por un instante. La musica chilena es linda, pero en arpa suena aun mil veces mejor. El unico pelo en la cola seria que la caratula que le pusieron no es la que corresponde a la del CD. Ojala puedan corregir eso pronto."
5,A Must Have,"I attempted to locate this software at CompUSA & Best Buy. Unfortunately both failed to have this displayed for sell on their shelves. (Possibly discontinued?) However, I purchased it ... and use it daily in furthering my research on Black History. The Researcher function of the program helps to tie in resources found on the Internet as well. My daughter also has found it helpful in retrieving additional information for school projects."
4,"Reliable, quality detector.","I've purchased this model for myself, my mother, and a close friend, and they've all performed admirably. Only thing I don't really care for is the 7-year limit on the life of the detector."
1,Expired after 3 months,"I had the same experience as the previous 1 star user. This was a replacement for the identical product which lasted 7 years. This unit lasted 3 months (it beeped once occasionally even though the test was fine). We replaced the battery, blew compressed air into the unit as is recommended in troubleshooting guides, to no avail. Unfortunately we no longer have the box to return it since it has a 5 year warranty."
5,Pretty good!!,"Solid product. Brought two of these to replace my aging Carbon Monoxide detectors, they look neat. Tested and work perfectly fine. Highly recommend if you are looking for a quality product."
3,No size information from vendor.,"The skirt was ok, but it didn't fit me. The size (large) was really small, not even medium."
5,A Source of Many Great Adventures,"I purchased this book the year after it came out and, a couple of years later when I got my first car (a 1987 Dodge Omni), used it as the start of many a pleasant adventure. Missouri is a beautiful state and the places featured in this book highlight many beautiful places there, as well as a few in Illinois. One of my favorites is the Sandy Creek covered bridge outside of Hillsboro, Mo., which was in the midst of a weed-covered field at the back of someone's farm the first time I discovered it. Since then, the area around it has been carefully cleared and turned into an hospitable park. My husband and I also came upon one of our favorite campgrounds through this book (Memory Lake). It is indeed the source of wonderful memories for us and for our friends!"
5,"Clear, concise and detailed...","Another great learning aide from Krutz and Vines. The authors have failed to disappoint me on any of the three titles that I have read by them. Although they do pull some of their previous work form the CISSP Prep Guide and the CEH Prep Guide, all of the material is presented in a manner and format that is meant to give the knowledge required for the Security+ certification. If anything, the use of higher lever material has only improved the wealth of information. Even the most complex concepts are explained in depth and in a manner that even someone relatively new to the field can grasp.Two thumbs up for this one! Just remember, as with any 'prep' book, don't let it be your only point of reference in studying for the exam."
3,Warning: Book Two of a Series,"I purchased this book not knowing it was a sequel to Krinard's Shield of the Sky. This book constantly refers to characters introduced, and events that occurred, in Shield of the Sky. I put this book down after Chapter Two and orderd Shield of the Sky. I recommend that anyone wishing to read this book should read Shield of the Sky first."
4,A great addition to our collection,"My younger son just loves Imaginext stuff and has most of the pirate and castle sets. He just recieved the Ghost Raider for his 6th birthday and it has been a big hit with both him and his older brother (9). It is a cool looking skeleton boat and goes so well with all the other pirate stuff- my son loves that it is spooky like his Phantom Island set. While some of the bigger sets (Phantom Island is a good example) have been a bit to detailed for my son to put together on his own, he was able to look at the directions and put all the pieces of the raider together by himself. This is a wonderful additon to the Imaginext pirate collection and a fun toy to fuel a child's imagination!"
1,Better off doing this yourself!,"I purchased this item and personally do not feel that it is worth the money. It is nothing more than a heavy paper card on a cheap backing. I was told by the company that sells it that they have thousands of happy cutomers, I guess I am their first unhappy one, or no one else bothered to complain."
2,Hardly Worth It,"Though a surprise hit, ""Hardly Working"" (1981) remains among Jerry Lewis' lesser efforts. There are a few laughs, but Jerry's inventive cinematic style is nowhere to be seen. It's a low-budget, poorly made film. The best thing about ""Hardly Working"" is that it enabled Lewis to make the far-superior ""Cracking Up"" (1983)."
4,Lots of Jerry Slap Stick Lewis,This is Jery Lewis's last movie. Lewis puts on a great show for all. After his job as a circus clown is gone Bo Hooper (Lewis) goes from job to job searching for his calling in mid-life. After many jobs and many halarious encounters he finally realizes what he has to do. Just be himself.
1,The worst -- don't miss it!,"This is the movie in which Lewis repays all his most generous MDA contributors with some of the most hilariously obvious product placement in the history of movies. If you're at all sensitive to product placement, and if you've seen enough telethons to know who Lewis's favorite corporations are, sit back and prepare to have your jaw drop to the floor. (It's also the comeback movie Lewis made once he saw how popular Steve Martin was in ""The Jerk"" -- how else to explain this movie's release shortly afterwards with the tag line, ""Jerry Lewis -- The Original Jerk!"")"
5,"Looking for ""My Indian Red"" from Tremé? This is it!","I purchased Jazz á la Creole in an attempt to 'collect' one of the songs I loved from the HBO series Tremé, ""My Indian Red"" by Danny Barker. The song on this album is in fact the same song and version that DJ Davis Mc Alary plays on WWOZ during the montage in Tremé's Season 1 finale episode, ""I'll Fly Away"". It is also the same album that trombonist Antoine Batiste searches for during the Katrina flashback, choosing to leave the record on a tabletop.I love the album, particularly Danny Barker's call and response contributions like ""Chocko Me Feendo Hey"", ""Corinne Dies on the Battlefield"", ""My Indian Red"", and ""Tootie Ma is a Big Fine Thing"", which are some of the first-recorded Mardi Gras Indian songs.A note on the sound quality: the CD was compiled and recorded from 78s or LPs, and probably not master recordings. I can hear a fair amount of exogenous noise on some tracks, less so on others."
3,It's okay though the themes keep changing,"When I got this book for my literature book, I thought that the story would be interesting as it had a very interesting title. However, I finally found out that the title of the story was not suitable and the themes kept changing. On the other hand, the book had a very interesting story line though I don't really like Anna as the main character."
4,Everyone should read it at least once.,"This is a very touching book. It shows the true experiences of a teen with a retarded younger brother. There's a lot to learned from this book. Valuable advices are given and a lot on how to cope with everyday chiddings. The book once known as Red Sky In the MOrning has a very significant meaning from my point of view as a red sky denotes on coming rain, and rain in the morning is not a very nice thing.it's just like Anna facing every 'rainy' morning and overcoming all her problems just like how we must continue our work though it's raining. Anyway, the book can still be gotten from Heinemann Educational Publishers under the title Red Sky In The Morning."
3,Great bands but not what I was looking for...,Dynaband makes a great product but these bands are short - three feet long. I mistakenly bought them looking for a replacement for my Cathe Friederich green band. I thought they'd be at least 5 feet long.Oops.
2,Not very mega,"I was most disaponited in this book, It reads like what it is. A qwicky attempt to cash in on the latest ( disaponting ) War-of-the -worlds movie."
1,I want my money back,"The back cover blurb is misleading - the giant robots are there for the first encounter alone, then they're gone for the rest of the story. The book was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors as well; I have no idea what the editor was thinking, or even if there was one.And the writing! I've seen fan fiction on the 'net that reads better than this. Save your money for something else."
1,false advertising,this company inflates the prices artificially and the same boots are available elsewhere for a much cheaper prize
4,Good Tutorial Style,"As with many of the other Teach Yourself books, this one walks you through the steps it takes to create applets and applications with Visual J++. I tinkered with Java, but this book made sense of it all by tying everything together."
1,Sams Teach Yourself Visual J++ 6 in 21 Days,I had used other 'Teach yourself' something 'in XX days' before and liked them. I sure got fooled with this one! Avoid this book unless you are already comfortable working with J++. The examples are confusing. It rambles. It presents bits and pieces but never gives you a solid foundation. I really regret buying this book.
3,"Good book for C++ programmers, but not for beginners","If you already have experience in programming with C++, this book is good to learn J++ in relatively short period of time, but if you don't, avoid this book. In my opinion, it's nearly impossible to understand without some knowledge on C++ or J++."
2,Not for Beginning Programmers!,"This book is being used as a textbook in my J++ class. I'm a programming student with experience in Visual Basic 6 and HTML, so I'm not entirely new to programming, yet I found this book very frustrating and difficult to understand and follow. It assumes the reader has a grasp of C++ and a good background in programming. No ""step by step"" code, no clear ""hands on"" procedures in the early chapters and way too much technical jargon for the true beginner to follow. If you are a novice and really want to learn J++ save yourself time and aggravation and follow the advice of a friend of mine and try ""Using Visual J++ 6"" by Scott Mulloy instead of this book."
3,Take No Prisoners,"This book would have been better if Dr. Burns would have made it shorter. This book attacks anyone and everyone; if it moves shoot it! She goes to great lengths to unmask cursory associates and then shows how through a long series of associations they make their way back to Graham. Yes, Graham is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It would have been more effective if this book had talked about Graham's actual activities and the Billy Graham Evangelical Association. That would have been more than compelling rather than 700+ pages that few have the time to read."
3,fun to see Mickey and Roger in a movie together,"As a big Yankee fan I enjoyed seeing this movie, but it was not beautifully scripted and the acting and dialog were not very good. It was clearly done for publicity after great success they had in 1961.Don't watch it if you can't stand bad acting and poor scripts."
4,Nostalgic Fun,"This film really plays like an episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"" because of the situation little Bryan Russell gets himself into. He tells his friends that Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were his pals when he used to live in New York. Now living in Florida Russell has to figure a way to get over to see Mantle and Maris in spring training to save the day. William Frawley plays their New York Yankee's coach. Do they come to Russell's rescue or not? This is a good family film."
4,Kill the Umpire,"Although ""Kill the Umpire"" is a great Bendix classic, ""Safe at Home"" is more like a documentary or short that would be included with a good movie instead of billed as a double feature. This DVD is well worth owning just for ""Kill the Umpire"". Now if they will just put ""It Happens Every Spring"" with Ray Milland on DVD I will be basball movie satisfied for awhile."
3,Mildly entertaining family movie,"I watched this with my four boys who are all big baseball fans. It reminded me of an episode of Flipper and I found it about as interesting. I did like the talk Mantle and Maris gave the boy about responsibility. My 10 and 12 year old boys thought ""it was ok"" ""little bit interested in some part, but not the best movie"" ""It was neat they had Mantle and Maris. I did not know they did any movies."" My 7 and 9 year old boys both liked it an said, ""It was a really cool movie."" For the price it might be worth picking up for an evenings entertainment. Just don't expect to much."
3,The M & M Boys Go To Hollywood,"Maris and Mantle were the greatest ""one-two punch"" in sports history since Ruth and Gehrig (and they didn't have the alliteration!) when this picture was made. Around that time they made a cameo in the Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedy ""That Touch of Mink"" so this was a natural progression.As you might expect, it's an incredibly sentimental, predictable movie about a little leaguer who sez he knows Maris & Mantle - you tell me the plot.The nostalgia factor is high and never embarrassing; in fact, Roger and Mickey do a decent job in the acting department. Manager Ralph Houk is on hand but not in uniform - William Frawley plays ""The Coach"" and does okay, despite being a little too old for the role."
3,Sometimes it's hard to go home again...,"I have the fondest memories of this movie from my youth. Whenever I found I was repeating myself for whatever reason, it was hard not to have a fleeting thought of William Bendix as Bill ""Two Call"" Johnson. So, finally, I had to see it again on DVD.I enjoyed seeing the movie again, but not while I watched it. One problem is that the memories planted when we are younger don't get reassessed from an adult perspective as we age. The histrionics and sight gags that seemed so appropriate to a 12 year old now seem way over-the-top and interfere.While I was watching the movie, my thought was, ""What did I ever see in this?"" But, a few days later, the memories of that happy 12 year old are blended with renewed memories of the details of the script and, once again, I get that warm glow thinking about it."
1,Kill the Umpire / Safe at Home,I never received the movie. It was mailed in late December and the expected delivery was 2 weeks. It is now January 29th and still no movie. I have filled out a complaint form several times without result. Don't buy from this site.
4,Awesome product,There is a lot of ginsing out there but the ginsana from pharmaton is the best you can get. I would recommend this product.
4,"Good, but formula may have changed.",this was always a good product. but i think the amount of gensing has been reduced. this product used 2 give me so much energy after & b4 a workout. but 4 the price i guess u can't go wrong.
4,High performance filter,Seems like a high quality product. Although I have no practical way of measuring the flow rate or filtering ability. I was a little disappointed that there was a tiny bit of rust on the metal parts. Although this is more a matter of storage conditions that the quality of the filter.
2,"Same as AC Delco, twice the price","I ordered two of these for my 2007 Saab 9-3 Aero (2.8 V6). I expected better from K&N.; These are the exact same filter as AC Delco. If you have an Advance Auto Parts (or other auto parts store) near you that carries both brands, check them out and see for yourself. The quality of the media is poor compared to the OEM Mann/Hengst filters for my car. The media was discolored with what appears to be black spray paint. There was also an excessive amount of sloppily applied glue down the seam.On the plus side, I like that they're made in the USA."
5,Best swing/ jazz fiddle I've ever heard,"Williams is to the violin what Django Reinheart was to the guitar. His playing is easy-going but passionate, complex and interesting but still catchy enough to make the melody stick in your head. I only hope I get to see him live before he goes off to the great concert hall in the sky - the guy is in his 90's and still amazing."
4,Falling for Grace,"Traumatized by a horrible car accident that killed her fiancé and ended her dancing career, Gracie Hart lives an unobtrusive life running Romantically Yours, a unique shop specializing in books, antiques, gifts, lingerie, and chocolate, anything for the romance connoisseur. Carson Price and his daughter Isabella are a godsend or an intrusion, depending on viewpoint. Gracie takes to them and rents an apartment to Carson. He plans on opening a cafe next door. What she doesn't realize is his real intent... to open a restaurant that serves alcohol with an atmosphere like a tavern in the evening hours. This man is capable of giving her everything she's been denied for so many years... and her biological clock is ticking. Heartwarming and tender, this novel will brighten many dreary afternoons in small town America. James shows special talent for traditional romance. Expect more from this author."
3,Not bad for 99c,"I enjoyed this story, although it came off a little more 'sweet romance' than the cover looks. And I liked Izzie's role, but there was a too much kid stuff in this romance for me. That said, I did like the scene at the end, involving her. There was (as I recall) one love scene, but it was not overly explicit. Except for too much telling and repetition of information and back story--and once saying the heroine was blonde while describing her as brunette the rest of the time ('...the entire group was quiet, all eyes on the tall blonde')-- the writing was fairly good. Not spectacular, but all in all, an enjoyable read. Three stars."
5,Falling for Grace,"The book was a book you find you did not want to lay down. It was a fast moving story. Also , a family story with a happy ending."
3,Academic but interesting,"This is a short history with more emphasis on commentary than the story (istoria). Without a background of the politics and historical processes of ancient greece, the reader will be confused by the myriad of allusions to events, trnds and characters. But if one has somewhat of a background with the material, it ties together these themes in the hisotrical development of sparta"
2,Dull and Too General,"On the positive side, Forrest presents a decent survey on Spartan history.On the negative side, his prose style is a bit awkward. He doesn't delve deeply enough into Spartan politics in the context of the Greco-Persian Wars. He briefly mentions the Spartan military tradition but doesn't spend enough time explaining it and talking about how it relates to Spartan life. He spends too much time talking about and commenting on the Lycurgan reforms. Lastly, the historical times, figures, and places just don't come alive when you read this book. Granted, this is a history book so we can't expect to be entertained, but we shouldn't be bored either.I was looking for a general history book with some forrays into specific aspects of Sparta, but Forrest stays at the general level, and offers a fair amount of commentary. I would have preferred less commentary, less analysis and more information about Sparta."
4,"Chocolat, The Soundtrack","An absolutely fabulous collection of music, we play it continuously, there is something organic about. Certain Tracks stir a very deep feeling and reminds me of picnics by the riverside. Whilst playing and reading to which section of the film each piece belongs, it brings back very clear images of the Actors and the part they played. A Great film and superb music."
4,Pleasant music from a great little film,"The musical score for ""Chocolat"" was so integral to the film that you will smile at remembered scenes every time you play the CD. But the music also stands on its own.I got the CD because I love the Django Reinhardt ""Minor Swing"" but I ended up being hugely impressed with the music written by Rachel Portman. She creates a wonderful, magical mood with her wistful melodies. This is a terrific ""put something soothing on"" CD that I play quite often. And it doesn't hurt to close your eyes sometimes, and see snow whirling around the enchanted town square of Lansquenet, and see Vianne's red cloak billowing in the wind."
4,Johnny's Track Swings,"Did you know the best track on the CD features the virtuoso guitar-playing of none other than Johnny Depp, who plays the romantic character, Roux, in Chocolat? ""Minor Swing,"" which is by far the most popular song on the soundtrack, as well as ""Caravan"" both show off Depp's little-known talent as a guitar hero. He started out as a musician and ""accidentally"" became an actor. What a treat to hear him play the guitar so beautifully and to experience a new appreciation for his talents."
5,Leave You Wanting More,"A wonderful addition to the series! When I purchased this book (after polishing off the 1st and 2nd volumes of the series in 10 days) I had assumed it was the end of the saga. I'm pleased to know that a 4th volume has just been issued.How good is the series? As an historical fiction buff, the author writes about a part of history which is not well known to casual students. He obviously has done his background investigations, because one gets a feel for what life might in fact have been like for folks of the 10th century.Okay, some of the coincidences he uses are a bit incredible, but suspension of belief is something one needs to do with this kind of saga. I found it particularly interesting to read the author's afterwards, in which he made clear what had been fact, what was supposition, and what was plain made up.Definitely a page turner. My adult son wrote in his Facebook page ""I should have been a Dane in the 10th century!"" I almost agree with him."
5,love this series,"this edition help me almost complete my collection , the author did a great job on this series , gets the interest of the reader using the fictional character , and yet depicts a real good history story"
5,I Can't Stop Reading This Series.,"Lords of the North continues the story of Uhtred as he ventures back to Northumbria. There are many twists and turns in this novel. Just when Uhtred thinks he has it figured out, Cornwell throws a wrench in Uhtred's plans. This book was even better than the last book and I cannot stop reading this series. Without a doubt, one of the best historical fiction series I have ever read."
3,Lords OF the North,"I liked the storyline,but honestly there was way more informationthan story.I would prefer to have a lot more story instead of the history of the Lords."
5,Simply good,"3rd installemt in Saxon series is as good as the 1st two. Cornwell paints the picture of 9th century England in a brisk and refreshing fashion using his protagonist as the 1st person narrator. The story is already well established, and although we know what happened to Saxon England based on historicals, I am still yearning to find out the conclusion to king's and fictional characters fortunes. Make suer to read all 3 novels before the next chapter of Saxon adventures apparantly coming Fall of this year."
4,"Good book, but predictable","This is a good book, not Cornwell's best, but good. If you like the previous two, you'll like this one.What kept it from getting 5 stars was the predictable nature. I'm not going to give details so I don't spoil things."
3,Cornwell spins a rousing yarn,"When reading 'historical fiction' I prefer more emphasis on history. I like the author to set a believable backdrop. I've recently finished Iggluden's `Emporer series' and Follet's Pillars of the Earth. Cornwell's work is in a similar vein to Iggluden, with much blood and gore, whereas Pillars is an epic novel. Nevertheless, Lords of the North is a great action adventure story with satisfying character development and an intriguing plot. Uhtred is like an old-school James Bond. It helps to have some knowledge of geography/history of Britain, but not necessary to enjoy this fast-paced romp."
3,"Good, but not maintaining the level","Crornwell is my favorite author of historical fiction. I've read several of his novels from the ""Sharpe"" and ""Grail Quest"" series, as well as the earlier two novels in his ""Saxon"" series, so I was eager to snatch up ""Lords of the North.""It's not a bad read, and I will certainly read the next installment, but in my opinion ""Lords of the North"" is not of the same caliber as either ""The Last Kingdom"" or ""The Pale Horseman"". In particular, the novel suffers from some heavy-handed deus ex machina. Also, the reader is treated to POV of the protagonist as an elderly, apparently wealthy man, reminiscing about the ""current"" events in the novel. It's not that I expect Cornwell to kill off the character, but these passages are a bit deflating to the narrative.I'd strongly recommend reading the first two novels in the series before reading ""Lords of the North""."
4,Cornwell at his second best,"As one would expect, yet again, Cornwell has produced an exciting read with varied pace, thorough research, and above all, excellent action scenes. The strength of the plot hides a few weaknesses in the narrative (bumping into most key historical figures of the period; returning quickly to proficiency with a sword after countless months as a slave-rower at sea etc). But story is satisfying, and the character, Uhtred, is slowly finding some depth. Whilst this may not be Cornwell at his best (I would reserve that claim for his Agincourt) it is still a gripping read."
3,Please be objective ....,"This is not the UNKLE we've grown to love. With that out of the way, we can take a look at this Shadow-less UNKLE release.The album has a good length to it with some additional remixes at the end. You do get your money's worth though but at the expense of quality. With the exception of Eye for and Eye, In a State, and Reign, there really isn't much there. The remaining tracks are pretty good but nothing definative or memorable. This might be a good album to have as background music to a posh restaurant or lounge.I can see how this might've turned off people expecting Psyence Fiction 2, but for a lounge album, this isn't bad at all. A solid 3 stars."
2,what a let-down,"i just bought this album today, and i must say i am disappointed. i love dj shadow, and unkle's first album, but this new album totally blows. aside from a few tracks (which i could have downloaded for FREE) it's really a boring cd. i do love the opening intro track though. after the intro i was expecting something totally amazing, something beautiful and abstract. but all i got was a boring song with crappy vocals. the third song was even worse. what is up with that cheesy, unimaginative, boring beat?!? i am going to be very cautious next time i think about buying anything from unkle, and even dj shadow, again. i know some people are gonna attack my review, but i am a music lover, especially electronic music. i know electronic music inside and out, but just compare the two unkle albums, and i'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion."
1,"Blech,","I liked the first UNKLE album OK, but I did not get anything out of this. Not one track on this entire album appeals to me at all. Very, very dissappointing. Now I understand why Shadow won't work with this guy anymore..."
5,A must have if you are applying for jobs iin USA,I got this book on recomendation from one of my friend...it covers all the basic topics most of the interviews ask you...infact all the interviews I gave have atleast 2 direct questions from this book...It gives you the overview of how to prepare for interview and what question to expect...covers wide rage of topics from Programming - HR - genaral computers knowledge.
3,Mediocre Title,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this book, and it is nice to have a single reference before an interview. This book, while including a satisfactory number of interview topics, does not go into enough depth on any topic. The algorithms described are not shown in enough detail or with enough emphasis on time complexity, for example. If you are looking for a quick refresher to calm you down the day before or day of a big technical interview, this book might be sufficient, but find other references for the heavy-duty studying in the week(s) before your interview."
3,very useful,"if you want to refresh your memory on C++ programming and basic data structure, this book does the job perfectly. An easy to read book with useful programming and interviewing hints"
3,Too simple,"While the book is fairly well written, I found it too simple for me. If you have little experience with C, linked lists, recursion and binary trees, then the book explains their usage pretty well. If you buy this book to find challenging problems, then there are only a few of them. The rest is your ordinary ""how to invert a linked list"" stuff."
1,Utterly useless,"Quick facts: In the past year and a half, I graduated college, underwent five interviews, four of which resulted in offers. In none of those interviews did any questions from this book come up.This book is not a practical guide to interviews. It's a red-eye catch-up course in first-year computer science. If you don't need that refresher, you don't need this book."
5,Fun book,"A great book if you a programmer, or if you in a position to interview people. I had a set of questions I would ask people, and this book definetly gives me a whole new set questions to interview people!It's also a fun read if you are a programmer, and want to brush up on your skills. I went through technical interviews at 10 companies 3 years ago, including Trilogy, and this book has a lot of great questions.The only bad part is it's pretty weak on soft interview questions, but there are other good books out there for that."
5,Ordered used got the new,I have ordered an used book with a low price and got a brand new book. not a single mark in the book. It was a surprise
3,Not that great for preparing,"This book may have been helpful for interviewing ten years ago, but I think the game has changed since then. The programming exercises and sample questions are way too easy, and are too basic to be examples of real programming interviews from today's top software companies. The interview questions are also very language-dependent, focusing mainly on C and Java, and the style of questions they present make it difficult to generalize across languages. There also need to be more abstract-thinking questions, that are not programming but are also not qualitative questions."
3,good for starters else shallow at best,"This book is an OK book; has losts of bugs on the examples and some proposed solutions are misleading (ie. UnflattenList can be easily implemented by traversing the double linked list from the tail, but the book says is not efficient, not true, need to worry about who is the father not the child.)Good to revisit basic concepts; good for fresh out of school trying to land the first job; shallow at best for professionals of the industry trying to shift roles (ie. PM trying to get a DEV job)"
4,helpful for experienced programmer long out of school,This book was helpful in preparation for programming interview for professional whose school days are far behind. Recent graduates could probably do well without it. But if it had been quite a few years since you were in a class the book serves as a good practical reminder of generic programming exercises that are rarely encountered in everyday work. One problem from the book was actually presented at the interview. Good investment if you want to refresh your skills and look for new opportunity.
2,You can't really use Cliff's Notes for being competent,"this is basically cramming. it's obvious when you know the answer to some common 'brain teaser' in an interview, and yeah, you get bonus points for doing your homework, but i'm just going to ask you harder questions until it's obvious that you're having to think about solving problems you haven't solved before.probably worthwhile if you're totally green and have never interviewed before, but if you've been through a few interviews you know what it's like, or if you've been on the other side and interviewed a lot of candidates, this book has very little to offer."
4,Confidence booster for freshers,"This book is not a solution for getting a software job. If you are a senior software engineer, you do not need this book and you may just browse wikipedia or google before new job interviews. Yet if you have fresh graduate friends or cousins, one great help you can do is giving this book as a gift.It gives guidance, prepares the clueless candidates, injects thought process, gathers basic programming techniques at one place, and more importantly it increases the confidence of a fresh graduate substantially."
3,Not sure anyone other than recent grads will see questions,"This is a good book if you are a recent graduate without any on-the-job experience, but I'm not sure if experienced programmers will many of these questions. My main profession isn't programming (although that's what I interviewed for), but I would think experienced programmers will see more real-life specific questions before they encounter questions about linked lists and hashes."
5,Very helpful,"This book does three important things:- familiarize you with topics you're likely to be asked about in an interview- builds confidence for programmers who are rusty in C/C++ (like me) by letting you work difficult problems out with only as much help as is needed- gives some good interviewing tipsI found everything in this book helpful with exception to the more specialized sections, which didn't really apply to the positions I was interviewing for. Even if it hadn't contributed to my interviewing skills (it did), I thought it made me a little bit better of a programmer.By the way, if you just read thru the book it will be useful but to really learn stuff you really should work the problems. Also, I found nearly every question I'd been asked in a big company interview was either in this book or a similar question in the same domain was."
3,A comic book not a novel.,"Let me say this again. This is a comic book. Not a novel in the paperback text type. It's a dark horse brand comic. Not the traditional comic paper book but a short novel book. Colorful.I'm playing the Dungeon Siege II game. I haven't played the first game and thought it might be interesting to pick up what was described as a ""paperback"". You've been warned."
5,Excellent,The book was one of the better conditioned books I've received lately. Entirely happy with my purchase...
3,Ok...,"The material is very nice, however they ride up really easily on the leg...also what is with the white patch underneath the pouch? It looked like I was wearing a pad."
3,Lame instructions,"Putting this together is probably supposed to be simple enough that you don't need any more than the little paper with unlabeled sketches on it, but it took me quite a while to figure it out and I'm still not sure I have it right. The parts I have don't exactly look like the parts drawn on the paper..."
2,Wonderful idea! not well built =(,"I love this tree house workshop! my 14 month daughter like it to the only thing that I'm not to exited about is the stability of the table the base is to small for the big tree that sit on top of it and the legs are not as strong as I expected, I was a expecting a better built product.This product is highly unstable and a small child can hurt is self, always supervise your child wild playing with this toy."
4,Very Real,"I love this film. The characters feel so real. No Hollywood glitz, just good storytelling."
4,Anti Vibration Gloves,"These are great, Husband is mechanic and uses these daily. The only complaint he has is that the velcrow closure gets in the way sometimes, but all in all, work great!"
5,My cats love the taste...,"Not only do my 3 cats love this kibble, but they are very very healthy after 5 years on this diet. Our vet always comments on how sleek and muscular they are, how shiny their fur is, and how great their teeth look.Anyone who says my cats can't live without meat is an idiot."
4,Interesting,"This album is pretty good. I really wish that there were more vocals, the guy has a good voice, but some of the instrumental songs are just as cool. Overall this album is enjoyable. Great guitar riffs, bass, drums. Steve Albini produced this album so that shows that people had their eye on them. I believe one of the members of this band is now in The Life & Times with Sir Allen Epley. Not a huge breakthrough in music but worth checking out just the same."
4,A great machine to sew with,"I have not sewn for many, many years and this machine is a nice welcoming return to sewing or for learning. The speed control is nice when you are building confidence with kids. One of the safety features is, was that it would not sew with the presser foot up, well, it does, so I might get a little hesitant to leave a inexperienced youngster on it. As for the case, it is nice with the little bit of storage. Being able to attach it to the arm is great to have a wide flat surface off of the arm, but if you don't have an ironing board or lot of table space it can get in the way. As for the motor, I haven't sewed any super heavy items but has been handling the medium with ease."
5,Best teakettle I've had,"I don't really close the whistling part much, so can't speak to other reviewer's complaint. Otherwise:* The handle is very easy to hold, and great placement for pouring* Easy to open for filling or cleaning* Looks greatIt was a steal at $15 from Amazon, not sure about $40 from this other seller."
4,A PART THAT FITS LIKE A GLOVE,"I am not terribly fond of revenge pictures,however this film is really worth seeing for MITCHUM's character...who can't forget the lawyer who send him to jail eight years before.Composer BERNARD HERRMANN adds to the suspense with another good score.Having seen the remake with DENIRO ,which goes over the top,i recommend the original in black and white.Such a story is fun in a film,but in real life it is certainly hell.While watching it,say to yourself:i am so glad that this is only a movie.Just imagine being stuck with MITCHUM in your basement..."
4,"Mitchum,s Revenge","Robert Mitchum doesnt even seem to move fast at all. He is delibrate. He seems to appear and then not be there..in a fashion as Mrs Danvers in "" Rebbecca""Few actors can essay Max Cady as well as Mitchum. J. Lee Thompson,s sure hand as director makes the images all the more provactive. If that wasnt enough its another thrilling film score from the master Bernard Herrmann.The film is shot almost in a documentary type style..untill Mr. Cady shows up. What you thought you saw on the screen is perhaps not as explicit as films of today..but exactly what does happen on that houseboat with Polly Bergen..? Pure Cinema!!"
5,Ultimate Thriller,"i am very inclined to agree with the other reviewers who rated this 4 stars or better. it is the ultimate thriller of the 60s. i have only one reservation about this one. the censor's code was too strict and forced great restrictions on the producers and director. to think of how much greater, as great as it already is, it could have been.for those of you who haven't seen the remake of this awesome thriller, don't waste your time, in my opinion. this is definitely the superior version. the only version.as for the DVD it has a theatrical trailer, cast bios, production photos, production notes, and best of all, a making of documentary.i highly recommend it."
5,Stick With This One: The Original,"Boy, this shows that you can still make a scary movie without a lot of blood, profanity and whatever. Hollywood didn't learn that, however, featuring all of it less than a decade after this was made. The Martin Scorcese 1991 re-make of this movie is exactly what I'm talking about.This original Cape Fear was legitimately scary, thanks to the performance of Robert Mitchum, who doesn't need to resort to the f-word to be a tough, sick and really an evil character as he stalks Gregory Peck and his wife (Polly Bergen) and daughter (Lori Martin).Bergan and Martin are two women I don't see too much in films which is too bad. They did a lot more TV work than movies. Another thing you don't see much anymore - a nice, sympathetic policeman - was also portrayed in here nicely by Martin Balsam.The ending has some holes in it, to be sure, but overall it offers a good 106-minute suspense story."
5,Cape Fear,"Never had seen this movie til I purchased it for my husband for Christmas. Wow it is something else. There really are sick, revengeful people these days more so then back then but their were some and that hits home with me as with all the killings here lately on the news. Like Newton Connecticut and every where else. We definitely need to help people with accessibility to Mental health care. This movie was awesome and in excellent condition. I have no complaints on quality, shipping or slowness of shipping. The transaction went smooth, delivery was fast and dvd was in excellent condition."
4,Good,"Robert Mitchum gives a great performance in this classic, Gregory Peck was equally good. They made a remake a few years ago but this one is a lot better. Watch this one before the remake."
4,Good movie.,"I think it is a tie between this version, and the newer version with Nick Nolte and Robert DeNiro. Each one has some parts that I like better than the other.No doubt about it though, Robert Mitchum is much more menacing and scary than DeNiro."
3,THIS is a CLASSIC?,"I expected this movie to be a hard-hitting classic thriller like ""Night of the Hunter"" or ""Spellbound"". I was astounded by the choppy storyline, bad editing, and terrible makeup and hairstyles (helmet heads everywhere -- not even in style when this film was made!).The casting was bizarre. Where did they get that weird kid? And the mother? What was with the mother's grunting-style-acting when her husband was looking for her on the houseboat? And back to the weird kid, who was too small for her age to play the part (she looked like a Raggedy Ann doll on steroids) -- why did she run back into the school? Script doctor, anyone?The only good part of the movie was Robert, who could stand there in his skivvies and read his laundry list and I'd be entertained. The three stars are for my boy Robert.You may not believe me, but I have to say this is not a good movie. I was surprised at the lack of quality.Buy ""Night of the Hunter"" instead, or any Hitchcock film. Why waste your money?"
5,excellent!,"this cd is awsom. they came to my daughter's school, and she said that she loved their performance. I give them a 5 star raiting. they are better than bsb and nsync"
1,"desevers less than one,but the 1 star is out of pity","Due to the poor production and lack of talent,i rate this newest ball in the house release unacceptable.their coming to my high school,i think i'll tell them what i think of their cd.what do you think? I dout anyone will read this since noone knows who ball in the house are.the other reviewers are their sisters."
1,Poor information,I recently purchased a quick books Pro 4.0. Nowhere in the decription did it say it only worked on an old mac and not with the new operating system.shame on you for this bad transparency of information . I feel like I was ripped off.
2,WEIRD MOVIE,I came from this area of Wisconsin. Gein dug up graves from a graveyard 3 miles from my childhood home. I don't know why a person would make a movie about Gein. He was a sick person and did alot of terrible things to people. He's not somebody to be glorified!
2,"Alright but could have been better,","This is one of those movies that doesn't completely reck of boredom but is right up there. I would call this movie ""much (Freddy) ado aboot nothing"" The playa that played Gein lookes like the crazy man but its just pretty stupid. I mean Ed what do you need that bloody anti-freeze for anyways. Better than Dahmer but worse than Gacy. Try to avoid this jobber of a movie unless your AD CL or JMaOrigially posted on Oct. 14, 2003FU/ HF"
3,Grisly but accurate!,This grisly but fairly accurate accounting of the heinous crimes of Ed Gein should be of interest to those who remember this weirdly bizarre incident of the mostly serene 1950s. It is quite gory and graphic but in checking out the accuracy of the events depicted I found it reflected newspaper accounts and biographical facts concerning Gein and his crimes. Ed Gein was a despicable and psychotically insane criminal. According to Wikipedia there are movies (Psycho and others) and songs written about him. I should add that this movie is not for those who hate gory subject matter.
3,A competent retelling of a serial killer life!,"Accurate and gritting retelling of the life of famous serial killer, Ed Gein, an apparently quiet and simple minded guy of Wisconsin. The movie goes deeper in his perturbated mind, his tormented relationship with his mother and father and brings out a crude but real portrait of the madness and profound infelicity of this mad criminal.Steve Railsback gives a impressive performance and when someone see this one maybe the question comes up: why Mr. Railsback is not a Hollywood favourite? I'm waiting for a reasonable answer."
1,Save Your Money.,"This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my opinion. The movie is slow and barely entertaining. The acting isn't good even for a low budget movie and it's boring as hell. You can rent it yourself and see what you think but your're better off just saving your money and going on the internet, check out some sites about Gein and read about him. The story is much more interesting when you're reading about him and it explains a lot more. Just stating my opinion, later."
1,BOORING,"Who'd have thought that a movie about the guy who inspired the Texas Chainsaw Massacre could be boring? Let's be honest, when I tune in to a movie about Ed Gein, I want to see some killings. I don't want 2 hours of a pathetic loser being verbally abused by his weird fundamentalist mother. The nasty little flashback scence of the pig gutting was the only scene that I felt was really necessary and illustrative of the sickness of his family.I kept watching in the hopes that this movie would get better, or at least keep me awake, but to no avail. Re-rent Psycho. It's a 1000X better.OK, having learned more about Ed Gein, I can say that this is a credible attempt to make a quasi-documentary about his life. Perhaps if the pacing had been more even, or the acting decent, this would have been a good movie. It just doesn't make the grade."
2,"Hard to watch, as you might expect...","Well, I do have to give credit to the actor portraying Gein, as it did take some courage to take on this role. As far as the movie goes, you definately will not come away with anything approaching a smile on your face. This is one of those movies that will probably bother you the rest of the day after viewing it. Now, of course this was a horror movie, but there really wasn't anything in this film that made it interesting enough to watch twice. I'd pass on this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
3,WORTH A LOOK.,"MADE ON A LOW BUDGET AND UNEVEN, YET SOMEWHAT SATISFYING MOVIE BASED ON THE LIFE OF SERIAL KILLER EDWARD GEIN. WITH A PRESENT EERIENESS AND A DECENT PERFORMANCE FROM STEVE RAILSBACK (ED GEIN) THIS FILM ISN'T TO BE IGNORED. CARRIE SNODGRESS WHO ONE MIGHT THINK IS MISCAST BECAUSE AUGUSTA GEIN WAS VERY OVER WEIGHT IN REAL LIFE, PULLS OFF THE ROLE. EVEN STEALING A FEW SCENES. STILL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE (OR EVEN FUN) TO SEE THE MOTHER IN ""WHAT' S EATING GILBERT GRAPE"" IN THE ROLE. WHILE I'M RELUCTANT TO COMPARE THIS TO HITCHCOCK'S CLASSIC ""PSYCHO"", IT IS VERY COMPARABLE TO GUS VAN SANT'S REMAKE (MADE N 1999). SO IF YOU ARE AMONGST THE MANY THAT WERE TURNED OFF BY THAT MOVIE, SKIP THIS ONE."
2,Pretty Good,"It reminds me of a really twisted TV movie but that is probably because of the pan and scan version I rented from ... Blockbuster. The chain that loves not pleasing its customers. This film feels very personal in a way and is a great evening alone. If you really REALLY love Ed Gein give it an extra star. I liked it a lot, I did not love it."
3,"ED GEIN 2001 - This is NO ""Deranged""!","I'll keep it short & simple - a decent account of Ed Gein's ""hobbies""......... a little short in my opinion & it leaves out WAYYYYYYYY too much. Very little gore is included. I can't understand WHY this movie was having problems getting released.... it's not gory at all & not very scary or disturbing either. I hope Rob Zombie's ""House Of A 1000 Corpses"" fares better. If you are looking for the DEFINITIVE film on Ed Gein..... try ""DERANGED""....... it blows this movie away."
3,Gore-y story of Ultimate Serial Killer Gein,"Stev Railsback and Carrie Snodgrass turn in Oscar-caliber performances as notorious serial killer Ed Gein and his mother, Augusta. It's tough to imagine pulling off a movie version of the most heinous of all stories...so frighteningly depraved as to ever effectively translate on celluloid. Well intended, interestingly directed and filmed (sold supporting cast, too) but ultimately only a fantastical version of the real story--which may just be too horrific to ever be dramatized.The story of Gein and his crimes is best told in documentary, which should have been represented through special features on this DVD which, unfortunately, offers none."
3,Better than expected,"This just looked like it was going to be a bad, cheapie flick, as it had no MPAA rating (indicating that it probably was straight-to-video), no flattering critics reviews to be found, etc. However, I found it to be a very tasteful production of a very tasteless subject. There is not a lot of gore here, but the storyline makes up for that, especially when you consider this is a true story. I have never studied up on Ed Gein, so I can't really say how accurate this portrayal is, but I get the feeling that it is fairly close because the performances and staging are so muted and never over-the-top. Railsback does a pretty good, creepy job of playing the title psycho."
3,Disturbing and unpleasant,"The Bottom Line:Ed Gein deserves points for making a concerted effort not to sensationalize or exploit the vile deeds of its titular character, but between the gross-out material and the ham-handed Freudian psychology (though admittedly in real life Eddy Gein had some mother issues) the movie just isn't very good and certainly isn't entertaining; there are few movies I regret watching, but this one came close.2/4"
4,Pretty good movie.,"Hey, I love Ed Gein as much as the next freak.....and I find this a pretty accurate depiction of ""Cousin Ed's"" career, if we can call it that.Worth the price of admission. Does not blatantly contradict the facts."
1,the absolute dullest film ive seen based on ed gein's life.,"-to begin with, this is not a horror film.... certainly its not a gore film either (there is very little here they couldnt show on tv)... the movie is too inacurate to pretend its a documentary of sorts... at the same time, its not even entertainingly bad, merely boring... a real yawner... if you desire to watch a film based on gein, and want something a little more real than texas chainsaw, and not so old as psycho, rent DERANGED... while being a helluva lot more entertaining, and more convincingly acted, DERANGED is also the most accurate depiction of geins life on celluloid."
5,Simply Beautiful,I had never heard of this artist before but he came up on my Pandora radio. I purchased this CD and have not been disappointed. Every song ministers to my heart.
4,If you are a blade fan...,You will enjoy the continuation of the seriesthere were some twist that i did not see comingand that was a good surprise.
4,Sweet!,"Sweet, laughable entertainment! Amanda Priebe is a young, powerful executive--too busy for love herself, but plenty of time to meddle in the lives of her closest friends.Her friends, however, have issues of their own. Haley, her secretary and best friend, is totally subject to Amanda's suggestions. Mason Eldridge, respectable on the surface, has an evil agenda of his own. Family friend and sensible ally, Nate Knighton keeps secrets that need to be told.Hidden jealousies, obvious attractions, and the confusion that results from ineffective communication make this book funny yet very, very sweet.Amanda is the contemporary telling of Jane Austen's story Emma.Armchair Interviews says: Sweet romantic entertainment!"
3,The Jane Austen Series,"I've never actually read ""Amanda"" yet, but I'm hoping to soon. I've read like 2 of the series. The series seems pretty good thus far. By the way, Debra White Smith was my 8th grade creative writing teacher so I've gotten a lot of good writing tips from her. I thought she's was a hard, strict teacher at the time, but looking back I'm glad she was as hard as she was 'cause I've learned a lot about writing from her. I definitely would recommend her books. Check out her book, ""Best Friends"", too. I really liked that one."
2,Make sure you REALLY want this...,"When my rug arrived, the fabric looked pretty different from the picture on the website...instead of looking like shag, I thought it more closely resembled beige Astroturf. Trying to return it has been a nightmare, though, since the post office informed me it was too large for them to ship. UPS refused to pick it up for the same reason--odd, since they delivered it. I had to have Target send a truck by to pick it up and I still haven't received my refund. Oh, and Target stores won't take it back either, which I found the strangest of all. So, make sure if you want to keep this rug, you are going to order it."
3,Stinky and Incorrect Color,"I received this 2 weeks ago and finally can stand to sit in the room or not smell the rug the minute I walk into my house. Whew! The quality is nice, however beware of the color shown on the site, the one I received is definitely NOT tan but rather a creamy/off white. Would reorder but not sure I want to go through the *adjustment period* again."
1,"Lonely Planet, do you screen your authors?","Despite a new batch of authors, the listed places were almost a direct lift of Jens Peters' work (including the ommission of Bulacan). What is different is the condescending way it is written. After reading the guidebook, you would think the Philippines is there with Afghanistan, Liberia, Rwanda and other wartorn countries. Although there are dangers, the risk level in Manila is about the same as any other major city in the world."
3,book review lonely planet guide to phillipines,I read this book cover to cover anticipating my trip so far it has given me a good geographical and planning ideas I can not say how it would turn out once Iam there.It appears though the authors are mostly europeans and canadians intent on giving their point of view rather than an american point of view.
4,the 2009 10th edition,"The 10th edition was well researched and updated .... at last...it is a vast improvement over the 8th and 9th edition which were rehashed versions of the old Jens Peter written versions from 2003 and before - with information from 2003 and before... The info I have first hand knowledge about is accurate for the first time since 2003 (I spend 2 months a year in the Philippines) The 8th and 9th editions that most of the reviews refer to here would get 1 or 2 stars from me.The Jens Peters book Philippine Guide has also been updated , raising it from 3 to 4 stars IMO"
2,Distressing injection of political prejudices,"Just as the cover photography of the 6th edition is far superior to the cover of this 7th edition, the bulk of the material in the 6th edition is far more informative and much more intelligently written than the 7th edition, with the added bonus that the 6th edition was not written primarily to promote the author's political viewpoints.If you can still find the 6th edition, buy it, and bypass this political diatribe disguised as a travel book."
2,Very disappointing,I downloaded the Kindle version of this book to take to the Philippines.The content may have been ok but navigation through this book was difficult - the index at the rear of the book didn't allow you jump to the subject - some of the available links highlighted took you to a different section to where you thought you were going. The maps were useless as you couldn't read them properly even if you zoomed in on them. Someone in our party had the paper version which we referred to after too many disappointing attempts at using the Kindle version.Perhaps reference books like this shouldn't be sold as electronic versions.Definite waste of money.
2,Just OK..,"Bought this edition on Amazon to plan trip to the PI, borrowed the Jens Peters' book and the Rough Guide from the library. Jens Peters' is great if you're visiting the country for months or plan on living there because it is quite comprehensive and detailed. I'll probably buy it if I retire there or for relatives who are already living there. Overall, I wished I bought the Rough Guide instead. It reads better and more informative on places I want to visit. There were more options on lodgings and sights to see, etc. I second the criticisms on the LP posted by other readers. I was able to peruse an old version of the Moon Guide at the library and it is so much better than LP or RG and looking forward to a newer edition."
4,Good value but sometimes inaccurate,"Unlike some other reviewers, I don't think the travel warnings should be suppressed. Yes these things happen rarely, but better safe than sorry! The Philippines are a very friendly country but let's not forget there are rebels in Mindanao and guerillas (even though almost inactive) on Luzon, not to mention the high crime rates in the big cities, especially Manila - and Lonely Planet as usually does excellent job warning about all of these. The locals I was talking to confirmed all the information.It looks though like except for the travel warnings this guide is not updated frequently. A small example: it claims that the voltage in Baguio City is 110V while it looks like they switched to the countrywide standard when the US military has left, 15 years ago."
2,The Links Don't Work On Kindle!,"Here's the problem with this book(And I don't know if it's the book or my Kindle): They've replaced all the prices in the book with links that say ""Click Here"". When you click on the links they all take you to something totally irrelevant. For example, if I click on a link about the price of the zipline in Davao it takes me to a map of Bacolod.. Other than that the book is fine and helps me a lot.The links that are actually typed out in URL form actually do work.."
5,John Coughlin,"I found the book very easy to follow & it gave a very good discription of what a new traveller to the Philippines would encounter. Very helpful from arriving to departing. I got this book on a recommendation from a friend, like him I would recommend to any prospective traveller to the Philippines."
3,Informative especially for the young,"Excellent information, good pictures, terrible maps (the tones are too similar in color - can't tell water from land). Great book for the young, party-oriented traveller."
4,Gonna be a mini series this fall,Just found out that this game will be a live action mini-series either fall 08 or winter 09. Stephen Dorff and Val Kilmer star.
3,DON'T LET YOUR KID BUY THIS GAME,this game is M(ESRB) for HUGE blood fest!but...if your ok with that its an ok game but not as goodas a 007 game.
4,Style over Substance!,"XIII has cool graphics! It doesb't get much better after that! All you do is shoot. Yeah, it is kinda fun, but not that much. The levels are boring and uninspired. I rented it. I'm not buying it cause it is not worth the money. It gets boring quick, and isn't worth playing. I'm sorry, but nobody else here played it! They are seriously lacking in the brain area.Go read a real magazine or site review! It got tons of 6/10's,5/10's, and 7/10's. It's cool, but not that cool. If you're an idiot you might like this."
5,Small Group 20's Sounding Jazz,"If you like small group vintage-sounding jazz, you will probably appreciate this CD. The 7-member band (plus soloist Carol Leigh who does a great job at singing ""hot"" jazz) includes Lew Green, an excellent cornet player (my favorite instrument), but all the musicians are super.Songs include selections about Indiana or songs somehow associated with Indiana (i.e., written by Hoosier native Hoagy Carmichael). Songs include, ""Indiana, Hoosier Hop, Blue Hoosier Blues, Hoosier Sweetheart, Star Dust, Can't Get Indiana Off My Mind, and Banks of the Wabash (plus 6 others). When the men who make the group sing, well, they're nothing to brag about vocally. But all in all, a fine CD."
2,Sarah Connor,I don't recomend this CD if you don't like rap. It was a waste of money buying this CD. There is about 2 or 3 songs that are good out of 11.
3,"""Bounce""","Let me start off by saying that I really like the song ""Bounce"". I think it has a nice beat, and Sarah Connor's voice suits the song.But I think ""Bounce"" is the only good song on this CD. The rest of the songs are kind of boring, and more on the jazzy side. This might be a good CD if you like slower songs. I thought it was a dud, though.Also, some of the songs were trashy, and talked about innappropriate subjects. Even ""Bounce"" kind of cusses. (...)"
4,Love that Terminator review,"Great review... I, however, like this CD. Don't paint the picture of about her sexy voice or sexy this or sexy that. It's about selling sex. What sells? SEX. One side is pretending this is a good music. Other is trashing it for selling sex? What gives? Take it whatever it's... Music industry's formula to sell music using SEX (soft core+ style baby, I like). Sarah's voice is not that bad either. So? Sex is better that Violents, right? Maybe you want some Gospel?"
4,OH!! my gosh..I love it!!,"The U.S version is awesome, she is a fabulous singer. i wish i would have known about her sooner. It looks like they took songs from her first and second albums and combined them for the american version. ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT!!!! very worth while to go out and BUY it right now!! The album has great beats and the lyrics are totally relatable.....i definitly ordering the IMPORTS of her first 2 albums Green Eyed Soul and Unbelievable.I LOVE IT, you will too"
4,excellent but missing something,"(...) Lots of tracks worthy of airplay and great tracks that will surely nod your head in your car or make you dance at a club.This is BY NO MEANS a ""Britney Spears"" clone. She actually HAS talent and her voice is great too!MY Only beef is that there are only 11 tracks, leaving the listener wanting more. They could have easily squeezed a couple more onto the disc.I recommend to EVERYONE into hiphop, RnB, pop, and dance to cop this baby!"
4,Poweful voice.,"I bought this cd only because of an advertisement on the radio where they played Sarah Connors infectious funky first single Bounce. I was hesitant, but I am extremely happy I did because I have not stopped listening to it. Sarah is one of the freshest and best new voices to come to music in years. Her powerful voicer dominates the album with it's uptempo hip pop tunes, to the dramatic power ballads. Never oversinging, never screeching, simply just singing. Highlights include Bounce, French Kissing which samples No Diggity, One Nite Stand, all destined to be radio smashes. Her ballads are not like the sugar coated ballads usually out there, they are gorgeous and sexy, and showcase her powerful pipes. The only downfall is the guests stars. There are way to many, and she's too talented to rely on rappers to spice up her tracks. She can do it all on her own."
1,bounce of the stage a review from kevin f,sarah has no talent what so ever i hate her so much and how she sings
5,awesome!,"It's one of the best albums I've ever bought. it's something new! Not like usher or eminem, who have always the same kind of music! I guess some people here don't like it because she's a german and its a new style of music. In accepting new things we americans were never good!the CD is awesome but i'm missing the song ""from sarah with love""!"
4,Good CD...But it's missing something...,"I'm a fan of Sarah Connor...and her US debut is good, although it is pretty weak for most of the songs after ""He's Unbelievable"". The song, ""Love Is Color-Blind"" with TQ is great and her cover of the Mary Jane Girls' ""In My House"" is fab. I also like ""Bounce"" and ""French Kissing"". Sarah has a great voice and it's a shame that the people at Epic left off one of her best songs, ""From Sarah With Love"". Where did they get the idea that it was okay to leave off one of her best hits from her US debut? I'd also like to know who's idea it was to use pictures from her first album, ""Green Eyed Soul"" that came out a few years ago... Not the best idea.... Nonetheless, I like Sarah's US debut....I hope that she's a success here...and maybe her record company here will think in the future when deciding what to release here from her."
4,Good for the novice . . .,"This is a compendium of Trungpa's writings, a Reader's Digest of sorts, and so for that, it is an excellent item. If you know Trungpa, skip this and go for the actual books that he wrote, as they are worth every cent and ever word written. If you are a commited student of buddhism, whether Zen or Tibetan, know he is truly one of the great teachers. His book on Mind Training is one fo my favorites, though I would start with Pema Chodron instead of him. His Shambhala training is excellent -- and frankly, he has spawned the best set of teachers than any other lama in our time -- Chodron, Ray, and his own son. Enjoy!"
5,Kids love it (we do too),"We've yet to be disappointed by Hermie and Wormie. Our girls, and all of their friends are quite entertained by the group of insects. The animation is incredible. We'll be adding more of Hermie and Wormie to our collection!"
4,Good,"We bought this for one of our daughter a couple years ago, the message of this movie is good, and my daughters like it, it gives them an understanding what Christmas is really about, and it teaches them to share also."
4,CUTE STORY OF COMMUNITY AT CHRISTMAS,I'M NOT MUCH FOR BUGS BUT THESE WERE CUTE ONES. THE STRY IS LIKE THE GRINCH BUT WITH MORE OF A CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW. CUTE FOR SMALL CHILDREN AND ADULTS WON'T BE BORED. LOVED THE VOICES.
2,Keep trying,"Cora, I understand your sentiment exactly- when is anyone going to write any lesbian fiction I can really relate to? This was better than most, but that isn't really saying anything - hence only two stars. Besides a highly implausible story, the two main characters were just not appealing in any way. None of the supporting characters were interesting and most were generally annoying. The death of one supporting character is completely unnecessary and depressing. A whole book about peoples' sad lives followed by a ridiculous ending out of a bad Hollywood movie - take a pass on this one.Completely frivolous note -> despite the late 90s publishing date, the author obviously had been writing for some time considering the descriptions of hideously 80s clothes. :)"
1,Another Disappointment from Lesbian Land,"Please, is anyone ever going to write a decent lesbian novel? I'd given up on them long ago, but picked up a/k/a for its misleading reviews. I THOUGHT that I would be getting a story about normal lesbian women (yes, I know it's hard to believe but they actually exist!). I THOUGHT I would be getting a story with wit and humor, perhaps one pointing out how funny it really is to have to be closeted in this day and age. I THOUGHT that Ms. Robson's acknowledgements thanking ""several women who wish to remain anonymous"" meant that these were friends who preferred not to be outed in print. Now I see that they were probably ashamed to have had anything to do with this book which was NOT (surprise, surprise) about normal women at all; nor was it witty, or warm or even well written. Ruthann Robson has just added another terrible novel about two ...... women to the lesbian card catalogue at the library. Do NOT buy this book-don't even steal it! END"
4,Buy this only if you really need it,"I was perfectly happy with the quick view built into Windows 98. But Windows 2000 doesn't have quick view built in, so I got this. This is expensive for something that does so little, but it does the job well. So if you are running Windows 2000 (XP?) and you miss quick view enough to pay the price, buy this; if not, don't."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have a law office and receive e-mails with attachments of pleadings, memos and other documents. I purchased this product because I often could not open the attachments. Either I purchased the wrong product or it does not do what I expected. I still am unable to open most attachments (particularly ones that have been zipped by the sender)."
2,disappointed,It said it would open visio documents. It did but I could not read the labels. This rendereed the product useless.
4,Cool Pool Tool,"Quick and easy to set up, although required re-piping. Have a small intermittent leak on Bypass setting but has not been a problem as it usually stops after running for a few minutes. Super quick delivery, arrived much earlier than expected and save me from having a cloudy pool."
4,Direct Replacement,I purchased this filter to replace the exact same model that was almost 20 years old and the valve was damaged by a freeze. Amazon had a great price and the free shipping was the final reason I purchased. The unit arrived very quickly but I could see that the box had been opened and resealed. When I opened the box it looked like a lot of the support packing had been removed. The only problem was with the base stand and had a large chip out of the edge. I did not want to send it back so I used the old stand and I works just fine. The new filter matched up to all the plumbing just fine with a few minor adjustments so I am overall happy with the product just not the shipping.
4,Sand Filter,I was very happy with my purchase. Everything came as described in a timely manner. It was easy to assemble and startup. Don't forget to purchase the sand though.
3,Hayward Pro_Series Sand Filter,I received as expected. Installed without problemsand it is working fine.The problem I have with reviews is that the review is done when you first get an item when the review should be on the item you are replacing. I haven't had this item long enough to give a correct review. Just the process of getting it.Amazon was fast and the product arrive without damage.Barry
1,Hunk of junk,After installing this product we found that the valve was assembled incorrectly. So while you are trying to vacuum the pool the waste goes right back into the water which creates a very big mess. So I thought I was saving money by purchasing this product at a discount when in the long run it will cost me more to get the water correct.
2,close but no cigar,"i purchased this item because it was the only hit for a replacement battery in amazon. i am overseas so i do not have a place to easily purchase a replacement battery for my dewalt. the battery does not fit well into the charger or the drill and it is an effort to make the battery ""drop in"" the charger and snap onto the drill. the first charge so far is not looking promising with clearly less current than the old battery i was replacing. save your money and spend a little extra time to find the original battery."
5,My favorite ornament book.,"Originally published in 1888, this book is the real deal. Honestly, this book renders so many others I have on the shelf useless. It goes through EVERYTHING ornamental from furniture, to alphabets, to architecture, to tracery, plain design, cutlery, and everything else you can think of. At first, I scoffed when I got this book because it covered such a wide range of ornamentation. I mean, what book have you ever seen that does a GOOD job covering a range? Then, when I got into it, I realized that it DOES go into detail in each section. Having 3000 images makes this possible, but what I like too, is there is a substantial amount of text explainig where the design comes from.I think its nearly impossible to find a book this rich in resources for less than $20 USD."
4,rebel strike is worth playing and buying,"Ok, this game has some style. First of all, I love the way you can ride different vehicles then the first game. Also, there are many levels and they are from the movie. The controls are great and are very user friendly. Also, the graphics are unimaginable, but have not changed from Rogue Leader.Overall, this game receives:Graphics: 4 starsGameplay: 5 starsSound: 5 starsStory: 5 stars"
2,It helps if you actually get the title,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION as GameStop will simply not send it or respond to emails asking for a status update."
4,Raymond George Watts is MUSIC,"I can't say enough good things about PIG, but this disc has a couple of boring flops on it like Crybaby and Inside. Wait to buy the re-release with some mixed tracks at thesickcity.com (pig's official website) for like half the price. The cd will probably be better, too."
5,piggy,"best industrial album in this worlda little different for pig some songs have an almost dark teckno thing to them it is not like kmfdm and it is not like pigs early stuff ie the swinning, sin ses salvationstill hard evil dark and creepy but in a different waybest songswhoreflesh festFOm is the hardest son on the album"
3,R U 4 Real,"I know that for a lot of Star Wars fans this great Sith can have a great collection value, but $124.99 you have to be crazy, specially trying to sell it at that price here were people come looking for low prices. I have seen really expensive numbers on this particular item on other web sites but this by far beats them all."
1,"Horrible, do not buy","I purchased one of these at a local hardware store after my previous fill valve (a different brand) stopped working. The first few days it worked great, but then I noticed that after flushing it would not start filling the tank. To get it to start I have to hit the outside of the tank or take the lid off and hit the unit itself. Now it's gotten to where when it starts filling, it won't stop!I have never thought something so simple as a fill valve for a toilet could be so stubborn or problematic. This is the first and last Korky product I will ever buy in my life, and I would return it but I can't find the receipt.And as for the ""quite fill"" bit, yeah it's quite, but aren't all new fill valves quiet these days?"
1,Deceptive packaging - it doesn't fit all toilets,"The Korky 528 toilet fill valve box states that the valve fits all toilets. This valve DOES NOT work properly in TOTO brand toilets. Three weeks ago I purchased and installed a 528 valve and it initially appeared to work correctly but then I realized the bowl was not filling completely. This lack of water during the initial flush subsequently caused our pipes to clog and created a plumbing problem. I have subsequently found that Korky manufactures a special valve (528T)for TOTO toilets at a substantially higher price ($26). I no longer have the packaging or receipt for the original valve so there is no possibility of returning it. I purchased a 528T today. Hopefully, it will work."
1,Leaks,"Despite several attempts, I could not get a seal where the new valve/washer meets the tank (Kohler, not Low type). Tried cleaning the tank, loosening and re-tightening the lock nuts (hand tight), etc. No luck. Never had this problem with Fluidmaster."
1,Korky QuietFill is a worthless product. Not worth the time to constantly replace.,"Don't bother with this product. I've had to replace it for the 2nd time, this time after less than 8 months. The valve fails, and water just keeps running. If your time to replace a fill valve is worth more than $5 to you, avoid this worthless product."
1,Returned it immediately because water kept flowing,"I bought the Korky water valve based on the premise that it would be quieter than my existing one. Installation was easy, but the first trials proved that it was not significantly different than the valve I was replacing in terms of noise. More disturbing was the fact that even after the water stopped filling I could hear the distinct noise of water flowing ever so slightly. It never stopped. I removed and re-installed it thinking that something was off. Same result, it never stopped flowing at the end of the fill cycle. After reading similar reviews here, I returned it to Home Depo and replaced it with a Fluidmaster one. Fluidmaster worked as expected on first try!"
1,don't buy a Korky!,"I have used 3 of these Korky Quite Fill toilet fill valve & flapper kits. 1st one I bought was because I wanted to see if it would actually be quieter than the original simple type of valve I had that lasted 7 years without any issues. It lasted about 6 months and it started making funky stop go noises until it filled the tank all the way. I called Lavelle industries because it comes with a 5 year warranty. They had me take the top section apart, put it together and worked for about 4 days. Called back again and was told to do the same and I said, ""hack no!"" I ain't doing this every single week, so Lavelle sent me another. Put that on, 2 weeks later, same thing! Called to tell them that these valves are garbage and I needed to get my money back. They sent me a whole kit that is going back to Lowes for my money back...I DON'T RECOMMEND KORKY TO ANYONE!"
4,Korky toilet fill valve,"The Korlky toilet fill valve was easy to install, just follow the clear instructions. The only issue I had was with the hose size - too large a diameter to fit the over-flow tube, so I used the existing tube. It would have earned a five star rating otherwise."
2,You can not believe everything that you read.,"I bought this book upon the two customer reviews. The book is not very user friendly for new users. Each chapter has an overall introduction, but does not address how, why or even when you should use commands and design principles. The step-by-step instructions are very confusion. English is not the author's first language, and it shows. The book is very difficult to follow. The projects in the book do not make sense for real world applications. I would not recommend this book."
5,You trim your dogs nails? Why don't you own this?,"This is a great product and must have if you clip your dogs nails. We've only had to use it once or twice when we first started trimming our dogs nails, but it stops the bleeding immediately."
3,Protect those toes.,"Actually, I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter who intended to start trimming her dogs' nails herself...... so far I have had no feedback from her as to its quality and effectiveness."
5,Superb quiet film,"I saw this movie quite a few years ago and was deeply moved. It is a film that is quiet and slow, but that provides the patient viewer with innumerable rewards. The plot concerns the accidental death of the oldest son in the family and the blame placed on the youngest son for this death. Although the family does not directly blame the youngest son, he feels tremendous guilt and the family memebers slowly pull away from him and each other. The movie has a great feel for rural families and small-town life and doesn't provide any easy answers or excess sentiment. Look for Linda Hamilton in a small early role as a bus passenger."
3,The Stone Boy,This movie is about a family mourning the loss of their 17 year old son/brother etc.. The younger boy accidently shot him and he stuggles to come to grip with all of what happened. His grandfather helps him out alot. It is a sad story. A nice addition to any movie collection. It is worth watching.
3,Good Film but not Great.,"I chose this film for the cast. However, the film doesn't hold water in a few places - where it is trying to ""bring you in,"" it just kind of leaves you hanging. You can't quite penetrate the outer layer. It's a good story - and the grandfather is a great character and has a meaningful relationship with the boy. However, the realism of the story falls apart when the boy runs away from home, etc. It just doesn't hold the interest and the credibility as it should, despite the realism of the setting, plot, and characters."
