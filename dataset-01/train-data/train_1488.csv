4,"Discouraged, but enlightened","Although I tried ordering this product several times I was disheartened when told first it was unavailable, then could not be shipped, then notified it could not be shipped to California. I was totally confused about why I could not use this product after using it for at least nine years. Then read the notice described on the product by Swanson's and became enlightened about it. This should have been told to me after the first time I ordered it rather than the 4th time I tried to order it. What a waste of time on everyone's part. I understand now why it could not be shipped into California because of some proposition stating it contains cancer producing chemicals. That sounds strange since you can buy the product at the local health food store."
3,Mfg Will Not Disclose Amount of Progesterone,"I bought FemGest Progesterone Cream and have been using it for the past month. I'm not sure yet if it works. I tried to find out how much progesterone was in the cream. It's not listed on the product. The manufacturer, Home Health, said that the amount was proprietary information and would not disclose the amount. FemGest by Home Health is not on Dr. John R. Lee's list of recommended progesterone creams. [...]caveat emptor"
2,Misleading Picture of Bag on website.,The Bag is okay. It isn't the same picture they displayed. The bag I wanted was suppose to be a dark brown almost like a mink bag not a fox. Really disappointed. They didn't even make the suggestion to return or switch bags.
4,Pleased with product.,Found this product to be what I was looking for and easy to install.Only wish Toyota and Weather Tech had some type of anchor for the passenger side front mat also. The coverage is great and so is the fit. The rear mat fits right in place no movement.
5,Perfect fit.,I bought this for my wife's RAV4 Sport. Very tight fit. Now I don't cringe when the girls have drinks in the RAV.
1,WARNING: A book which presents a view not supported by Scripture...,"When one takes the time to actually read not just the Book of Revelation, but the prophecies given to Daniel, Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, and other prophets, the preterist view makes absolutely no sense. You have to jump through far too many hoops to get to their conclusions. A plain, literal, proper (HONEST) reading of God's Word guided by the Holy Spirit will never lead someone down those silly rabbit trails.I was shocked to learn that this book was so embraced by the Southern Baptist Convention -- a group I truly thought was reasonably well grounded in bible studies.No, this book is definitely to be avoided except possibly as a reference to heresy.This book by A.C. Gaebelein gives a much more grounded and bible based analysis of the Revelation. A must have for anyone serious about end-times study.The Revelation, an analysis and exposition of the last book of the Bible"
3,Information book,"It's a nice book as a extra guidance if you already practice Xing Yi. If you are seeking a manual, this book is not for you. The book only goes to describe everything, but it never shows many pictures. And the 12 animals are barely touched upon. Once again nice introduction or extra guidance, but not a manual."
3,wonderful,It was an enlighten view of the art and how it can aid one in boxing and health. I will also be purchasing more on this topic.
3,Far from bad but not the greatest I'm afraid (for me),"As the title says... for me, it's far from bad but not the greatest. not that the author attempts to make this definitive in any way...in true xing yi style it makes no apologies for what it is, and for that i respect it...not like the 'i'm so awesome and mystical and stuff' books so common for the internal MA scene, it does not claim to be the be all and end all and i think that's a good thing.i picked this book up at the local MA shop years ago and i bought it for one part alone - the advice section at the end of the book. the rest of the book, in my humble opinion (and feel free to correct me) is crap. I'm really not a fan of it. But the advice section is pure gold i think.Buy it? It's up to you...."
4,Focusing on Him,"This is a book to be read and reread, along with Scripture, to draw us focus on Christ and help us become totally sold-out for Him.Read entire review at AUTHOR'S CHOICE REVIEWS http://come.to/bookreviews"
4,The first case of big business and the US war machine,"Under the guise of ""doing his bit"" [for the war effort], Tom develops a tank to fight the bad guys in Europe during the First World War. Not to mention there's profits to be made...Once again, Tom and his friends overcome spies and saboteurs to sccomplish their goals..."
3,"Could Be Better, Good Idea But Bad Design.","It's quite a good idea, but the design could be a lot better. The sides straps need to be push from upside down, it would be better if you coul pull them towards you instead."
1,Neo Nazi Swill,"I bought this book on the supposition that the author might have been a misunderstood anti-Modernist, like Nietzsche. I reasoned to myself: ""The Nazis abused Nietzsche, so perhaps the Neo Nazis abuse Yockey"". I was WRONG. This is pure, undiluted racist drivel. Yockey seeks to blame everything that's wrong witht the West on the mixture of ""inferior"" races with Europeans. What nonsense. There are no inferior races, simply because there are no ""races"" at all. There aren't any subspecies of homo sapiens, period. That fact of biology, alone, is enough to render this book worthless.JC"
5,Great philosophical truths,This book should be read by anyone interested in the eventual triumph of Western Civilization. A thorough understanding of what it means to be a part of a High Culture is necessary to understand the forces extant today which are trying to destroy this Culture.
5,How is one forced to commit suicide?,"I read this book in 1968. I have not been able to get another copy until recently. It was not available in the California library system.One only has to look at the current political environment to understand that Yokey was right! Sometimes, we find things out only when we see........ - Don't listen, Look! You may not hear the whistle, but you will always SEE the locomotive"
5,A Prophetic Study,"(Ulick Varange) This prophetic masterwork is at once a sweeping historical-philosophical treatise in the Spenglerian mold and a clarion call to arms in defense of Europe and the West. Matchless prose, historical insight on every page. The brilliant young American author, a magna cum laude graduate of Notre Dame law school, sees through Allied wartime propaganda, and philosophizes with a hammer in favor of a coming Western empire of ""absolute politics."" Scholar Revilo P. Oliver praised Imperium as ""a work that we must study and ponder, if we would act intelligently in our time ... The great value of Imperium is that it forces us to reconsider our position realistically. We cannot afford the least sentimentality or illusion ... Our situation is too desperate"
1,Not as Pictured,Just received this item and it has 2 issues.1. Color is not the same as pictured. (Mine showed up as a black not tan.)2. Item does not hold a box cutter as pictured in the right rear slot.If they supply a picture then it darn well ought to look like the picture and be able to do what the picture shows (hold the box cutter.)Really unhappy with this.
4,the reader will delight in the simplicity,"Seami Sivananda was a western woman who took sanyas at the age of 44 in the ancient tradition of Kundalini Yoga, and was encouraged to return to the West to share her teachings. Over the next 40 years, she and her followers established an ashram in British Columbia and many ""Radha Houses"" in several countries. Forsee became especially close to the master. This is the story of his spiritual development, and the story of his relationship with his beloved teacher. It is well written (journalism was Forsee's first career) and candid. From the unexpectedly sultry picture of a young Radha on the cover, to the stories of love between her and Krishna woven into a spiritually intimate relationship, the reader will delight in the simplicity of a very human tale full of both questioning and light revealed."
4,Not quite as crisp service this time.,"For fans of the ""Are You Being Served?"" tv series, this dvd is a must to add to their collection. The cast is a little older now and the jokes are fairly predictable. The new cast members make up for the loss of some regulars from the series, even though Billy Burden does laugh at his own jokes a bit too much. This dvd is much fresher than the ""Are You Being Served?"" movie and is well worth purchasing."
2,Are you being served-----Again,"This sequel is not really bad, but it's not good either. Of course, it's meant to be farce, but it's very broad comedy in some episodes. The aging characters are showing their age also and sometimes seem too focused on one topic to the unfunny moment. Certainly, I would not recommend buying this set. Watch it,yes, when you can for free."
5,Are You Being Served? Again!,"Here is my favorite British comedy ensemble. I simply loved the original ""Are you Being Served"" over the years - and rerun after rerun. I would purchase the complete box set if it wasn't for the price. Should have purchased the set when it was $44 lower recently. But I bought the second series (which isn't quite as good as the first - but very entertaining anyhow) and which is quite reasonably priced. I also have a copy of their full-length movie. I thoroughly enjoy this cast with their wonferfully humorous interplay. If the original series ever comes down in price again - I am jumping on it with glee."
1,terrible,This has to be the worse series I have ever watched. Line after line is lame childish sexual innuendos.I have ordered several of the BBC series and enjoyed them. This makes me very leery of ever ordering again. I would never recommend this to anyone.
1,Dismal,"Utterly dismal, totally unfunny, not subtle at all. You need canned laughter on this one so you know where the ""jokes"" are. Not so much of a sit-com, as a sit."
5,"Yep, I'm being Served!","Yep, I'm being served a truck-load of entertainment! Great picture, sound and enjoyment when I need a ""pick me up."" No matter how many times I watch it, I can't help laughing out loud!"
4,are you being served? again,"The characters are for the most part from the ""are you being served"" series. There are 3 new characters introduced, a farmer, his daughter and Mr Graces mistress. Mr Grace invested their pension fund in a hotel and now they have to operate it to survive. Anybody who enjoyed the orignal series will enjoy this."
3,"Are You Being Served, Again? or Grace In Favor?","Are you being served? Again! is not for everyone. As a fanatic about the 70's original series Are You Being Served? I thought I might try this follow up series.Though funny in it's own right. The formula that had worked so well in the previous series was no longer there. For example, all of the former staff of Grace Brothers Department Store are no longer in any position of authority. Which doesn't allow for the jokes when it comes to going over another's head. Additionally, the cast has aged so that some of the sexual innuendo (references to Mrs. Slocomb's cat, for instance) no longer seem to make as much sense.While the show is cute in its own right. I think that only the most devoted of Are You Being Served?'s following ought to purchase this dvd set."
5,The Old Gang's Back,"If you liked the original series, this series continues the themes and comedy that made the original so funny. The same members: Mrs. Slocombe and her ""pussy"" (cat), Ms. Brahms, Captain Peacock, Mr. Rumbold, and Mr. Humprhies join this cast. They find out that their retirement fund that they paid into for years and years has been invested in a manor house. Joining the crew are Mr. Multurd, his daughter Mavis, and Mr. Grace's companion in his declining years, Ms. Lovelock. Expect the usual use of double entendre and slap stick. I wish the series had lasted more than 12 episodes (some of the cast died). A great addition for any afficiando of the Are You Being Served? series."
5,"""I've Got My Snout In This Trough!""","In some ways I found this series even more hilarious then the original AYBS. What a shame it didn't last longer.I love seeing the Grace Bros. Gang in a different more real outdoorsy setting. It really gave the show some air after being shut up in the store for years. The new characters just added to the fun...especially everyone's favorite Mr. Molturd. I imagined him to be just like that in real life..it hardly seemed like he was acting at all. As an avid fan of this entire series, it's just like eating potato chips...you can't (eat)watch just one! It's addictive."
1,Very Disappointing,"The Friends of Ed books on Flash are excellent, but this one is a total dud. These people are not even remotely ""masters"". The tutorials are impossible to follow, and the artwork is second rate.There is endless blah-blah-blah by each arist talking about him/herself that has nothing whatsoever to do with Photoshop.The two exceptions are Derek Lea and Gavin Cromhout who do a creditable job of offering useful instruction and interesting art.Several of the others in this book are not only not masters, they seem to barely know how to use the application. Save your money for a book with real content."
5,Get It,"There is really not much to add to the positive comments already posted. This book really is extremely useful. Whatever level you are you can find some inspiration here. There is an assumption you have an intermediate-level knowledge of the app, but that's ok, cos even if you dont you can just pick up your manual/power PS up and work it out. The key to this book is its insight into the processes of seasoned, acclaimed, professionals. If you aint any of those right now, or even if you are, you will benefit from this book.NB - I'd drop it a half-point as the CD is pretty useless. But that would be unfair - think of the CD as a candy accompanyment. The book is worth its weight alone."
2,How not to make a book.,"Firstly, there are possibly 4 of these artists whom I would call ""masters"" of Photoshop. Judging by the tutorials, most don't know Photoshop nearly as well as they claim.Secondly, the book itself is a terrible representation of graphic and book design. Practically every page has pixellation, and some pages are just laughable. If this is a book about the ""masters"" of Photoshop, all of the images in it should at least be in the correct resolution. Any Photoshopper, or Adobe CS enthusiast would know that. Not to mention the bad page layouts.If you are a beginner, good for you. Buy this book. It will give you a few good tips and ideas. But if you are already heavily into the Photoshop world, avoid this book. It will make you cringe."
2,Maybe I missed something...,"but for some reason I expected this to be a book with Marine Corps combat photography in it. There are very few pictures- it's mostly text. Maybe I didn't read the review well enough, but it wasn't what I expected. It might be a good read, but I'll be returning it to get something with combat photos in it."
4,Minnesota Charlie,"We do a lot of baking and we needed a few more cups for measuring. Very nice set and we are using them all the time. The kids use then to microwave water for tea and cocoa. One thing I noticed about the Pyrex brand of cups is when I pour a liquid (hot water) it dribbles out along the edge getting the counter top wet. The first set sent to us was broken. Again, Amazon sent out another set right away, Amazon makes the returns so easy, thanks Amazon. I think the Post Office needs to settle down a bit. No more box tossing in the back room guys."
5,Pyrex passes the test of time,"I've had my measuring cups for almost three years. In that time, I have used them in the microwave to cook small servings of vegetables, I've chilled them in the fridge with dairy products to make ice cream, I've measured everything from milk to peanut butter. They look *exactly* as they did when I bought them. No cracks. No scratches. No nicks. The printing is as clear as the day I bought them. These products perform time and time again with no hassles, no worries. And, they are very easy to clean! I love my measuring cups."
3,Just exploded,"My 1-cup measuring cup (that I loved dearly) exploded in my hands while I was measuring brown sugar. Other than getting glass in and over my recipe, and nearly putting my eye out, it was really a great product."
3,Satisfied,"I purchased these for my son and his girl. They are living out of state, going to school, and this was the best deal $ for getting some of the kitchen bascis that they needed."
3,$9.99 = Save $3 by foregoing the lids,"I mix ingredients in these as well as measure liquid and because the lid is not airtight, I rarely need the lid."
2,Cognitive Therapy of An Avoidant Personality,"This is not worth the money...It's basically a tape of Beck working with a woman with Personality Disorder NOS, not a classic Avoidant P.D. She has already obtained a foundation in CBT through her regular therapist, and Beck does some basic work with her over 2 sessions. I didn't learning anything new. Disappointing."
1,A black night,"Rosemary Sutcliff is a deep and evocative writer. She uses words as a master smith, weaving pictures and emotions together to create a riveting experience that touches ones soul.In this story, she turns her power to a fascinating time of history, and explores the depth of human depravity.Song for a Dark Queenis aptly titled. With her words, Sutcliff does create a song. It is a poem, but not one of beauty. A song, but not for pleasure. The golden rays of sunshine that peer through the forest leaves in the early chapters fade away. Black night seeps through until no more light can be seen. Innocent childhood is destroyed by horrific depravity. Good motives and familial love is swallowed up in ruthless hatred. The world is evil without redemption.A song with no hope: its end is darkness, death, and despair."
4,Very good resource,"I've used this book a TON at work with breastfeeding moms. (I work in a Neonatal Intensive Care environment). I also bought it to use for review for the IBCLC exam. It's not the only book I own but I'm glad I have it. It contains more information than the ""average"" mom may want, but it sure gets borrowed a lot! It's easy to read for ""lay people"" or professionals and has a lot of practical information. Love the spiral bound copy so it will lie flat. When it says ""LLL"" you know it has to be good. I do wish it contained more pictures.....if so, I'd give it five stars."
3,oldie but pretty goodie,"Written in 1963, the illustrations in this book are not up to today's standards. Nevertheless, this book was a great favorite of mine when I was learning to read. It's an ""Easy Reader"", with short sentences and large font for the beginning reader, and the plot involves an irresistable kangaroo. Everyone loves kangaroos! If you're prepared for the rather blah illustrations (although facial expressions are done quite well) you might really enjoy this book. It's very amusing!"
3,Good,The only bad thing is you cant take it off. But why would you? It looks good--it hasn't ripped or anything! You can't complain!!
4,Pill bottles for storage,"We are using these as pocket change collectors for a Sunday School missions project.They are perfect when labeled as little reminders throughout the week and placed on dresser and counter tops, and kitchen tables.One out of the thirty-six had a broken cap, but, still usable.Shipping cost is the worst part."
4,Just what I wanted,"These vials work great for my daily vitamin/minerals. They are just a little shorter than the other 13 Dram bottles I have, but the are still large enough. Shipping is a little pricy. I did not want a child guard cap, so these are exactly what I needed."
4,"Good for oral hygeine, but still an ""acquired taste""","I previously ordered the cinnamon sticks, and although I did like them, the flavor was way too bold and actually burned. This flavoring actually leaves the stick tasting a bit more like wood (there is still a strong spearmint/menthol flavor which leaves a light burning sensation, though). I'm still on the fence as to whether that's better or worse. They do quite clearly remove most all plaque on your teeth, if any, and are enjoyable to chew on."
2,trying to be the real thing but not quite,I liked some parts of the movie however im a rollerderby fan and several of the things were innacurate in the film like the blocks and the overindulgence of fights which current rollerderby doesnt have ( cause there are alot of rules against it and you get ejected from teh game if you even hint at fighting now). I understand its partially supposed to portray the teams that restarted derby in the early 2000s at the thunderdome. What i was peeved most about though is that the main character ditches her bestfriend and leaves here there with a beer to get arrested by the cops while she goes and gets laid and is underage wtf ( by a guy who treats her as a groupy no less and sleeps with other chicks). I meen you couldve had the violence in the movie while still teaching the youth of america values and such but noooo.
5,Babe Ruthless.....,"""Whip It"" is the most fun I've had all month!An outstanding cast starring Ellen PageJunoas Bliss Cavendar a.k.a. Babe Ruthless, produced by Drew Barrymore50 First Datesstarring as Smashley Simpson . Also starring -Jimmy Fallon ... 'Hot Tub' Johnny RocketFever Pitch& Late Night w/ Jimmy FallonKristen Wiig ... Maggie MayhemAdventureland& SNLZoe Bell ... Bloody HollyDeath ProofEve ... Rosa SparksBarbershop & Barbershop 2: Back in BusinessJuliette Lewis ... Iron MavenThe Other Sister&From Dusk Till DawnA very smart comedy that will keep you smiling & laughing throughout.Great cast, smart writing, alot of fun and a outstanding soundtrack, what more could you ask for?Ellen Page is a major star, she shines bright in every movie she is in & I look forward to her next one!""Whip It"" is based off the novel by Shauna Cross -Whip It, which was originally released as ""Derby Girl""!Enjoy~"
2,Skip it,"It had its moments, but not many. This is an oft told ""coming of age"" tale, filled with cliches, stereotypes and little in the way of nuance. The plot had potential but lost its way in a swamp of tacky, adolescent behavior. Good directors are made, not born ~ will look for a better sophomore effort out of Drew Barrymore."
4,One of the few cases where the movie is better than the book.,"The book this is based off of (Derby Girl) features all the same characters and scenarios as the movie, but the Ellen Page version of Bliss/Babe is much more sympathetic and warmer. The book version of Bliss is a perpetually sarcastic, compulsively-lying klepto. The movie also expands on the coach and the fellow players, making them a little more fleshed out and fun to watch. Drew Barrymore's maiden voyage into directing is a nice one. Roller derby forever!"
4,Kool Movie,"We were looking for a Drew Barrymore movie, because my lady friend really loves her. We were surprises that she's only in it in a minor role but the plot of the movie is great. Would definitely recommend."
5,Love it!!!!!!!,This is a GREAT movie with GREAT all-star cast!!!!!!!Love it!!!!!!! A must see for anyone who was around in the 70's.
4,A very cool movie which doesn't make all the obvious choices,"A very cool movie which doesn't make all the obvious choices but still hews close enough to cliche to stay in or near most people's comfort zones. I'd expect the most common reaction to be ""I liked it. It was a little odd."" Drew Barrymore is most definitely a skillful director."
3,"Whip it ""good""",I had read a few reviews of Whip it so I knew it was a decent film. The acting was superior. The plot wasa bit flimsy but was adequate. It was an enjoyable film. I liked her dad very much. Ellen Pages' in the filmthat is. The boyfriend part ws weak. Juliette Lewis was at her best. Zoe Bell was good.
4,Whip It,Enjoyed it while traveling on a plane ride.Was not what I was expecting so was pleasantly surprised. I did rent it on my Kindle so that was nice
4,Whip it and like it!,"Great story, characters and fun.....buy it and enjoy. The characters and subject are unique..women's roller derby. The story, although focused on the younger crowd, is still universally enjoyed and the cast is wonderful, talented and VERY funny."
4,fun,Good film. Great cast. Very entertaining; and now I want to go out and find our local roller Derby team and watch.
3,Not the most important movie I've ever seen...,"But I enjoyed it. Good lead. Fun story, but a little juvenile at times. Still glad I watched it. :)"
5,A Gift,I love this movie. I gave it as a gift to a friend whose birthday celebration included a trip to see the local Roller Derby Girls. I think all the women in this movie do a splendid job. Kudos to Drew Berrymore for her directing and especially to Ellen Paige for her acting though there was not a weak part in the entire movie.Want a fun evening? See it!
2,So slow,"This movie has all the elements to be great but fails miserably. It's a cute enough story but the acting is incredibly flat and one dimensional. I'm sorry, I love Kristen Wiig on SNL but in movies she's just not that dynamic enough of an actress to hold my attention to be convincing at all. That pretty much goes for all the actors in this film. Decent story but a very slow and boring watch. Pretty disappointing for a movie about roller derby."
4,Unexpected Drama,"I've got to agree with a lot of stuff this Roger Long guy wrote who reviewed the movie right before me. The romance really is tossed in for no reason, seeing as how it's quite unresolved at the end. Maybe the resolution was edited out for time reasons.On the other hand, I think the struggle between ambitions of children and the plans of their parents is depicted surprisingly well. Not something I expected in a movie that's based on a sport that reminds me of pro-wrestling. I keep waiting for the day when a roller derby girl will get disqualified for hitting a fellow competitor with a chair.The coach in this movie is hilarious. Even though Jimmy Fallon's forced laughs aren't bad, I have to say he's upstaged by the coach here. Of course, Whip It is really more of a drama than a comedy. Watch it if you want to see something about parental conflict."
4,"""Ruthless"" fun!","Whip It starring Ellen Page is a cute coming-of-age flick about a small-town girl who wants to be a roller derby babe. Page is such a real and technical actress, without her - this movie would seem rather fluffy and shallow. Drew Barrymore directed and co-stars in this film, I was quite impressed with Barrymore's style of direction - I just didn't care for the character she portrays in this film. Kristen Wiig and Juliette Lewis are fantastic in their roles. This is definitely a quirky and well-written film with a few awkward moments, check it out and I love the music soundtrack as well."
3,Whip It,Pretty good story. All of the roller derby scenes are my favorite. Juliette Lewis makes the movie.
4,Good Family Movie,"I found this movie to be a bit more complex than I initially gave it credit for. There are some real issues being addressed here, mostly between the mother and daughter with the pretty quiet dad being heard as well. I think Barrymore's attacks were completely unnecessary as well as several other fights that I think just marred and took away from the movie.Those things are the only things that keep me from giving it 5 stars. Otherwise I think it is a movie that can be used to open up dialogue between parents and children with issues that definitely are a part of life."
3,Where's the Commentary?,Just to let people know that there is no commentary as stated in the description. Kind of a let down but if it would have been Drew that's ok. If you listen to the commentary on (Riding in cars with boys) you will see what I mean. SHE IS VERY ABOVE US ALL.
2,"Boring,... except for the cute girls on skates.","I found this movie to be kind of boring. It does have a lot of stars in it(Jimmy Fallon, Juliette Lewis, Drew Barrimore, Ellen Page, ect...)And is geared more towards a younger, female audience(I'm 33 male).But I now understand the rules to roller derby. 2/5 starz."
1,"Dont buy it- the trailer has the best footage, go get that instead","Disappointed.I had high hopes for this film having watched and totally enjoyed Juno, I thought Ellen Page would be the new Thora Birch/Christina Ricci/Janeane Garfolo.Page certainly tries to do her best with this film, has a few good scenes and makes me laugh but unfortunately the script, direction and her co-stars let her down so badly not even her quick quips can save it.Im not adverse to a good sport film- dont get me wrong; roller derbys are certainly interesting and I enjoyed learning more about them (hey i even wanted to dig out my old skates after I watched this) but Im overwhelmingly disappointed with what good have been a great film that failed to deliver.Im giving it one star simply out of respect for Juno and the hundreds of hours I spent rollerskating into the side of the skating rink wall in High school.Ellen- Hope your next one gives you the missing elements that this one should have had :)"
2,I must have seen another movie!,"I really wanted to like this, but I just never warmed up to it. Three big problems: script, casting & directing. The script falls so flat - how can a movie about women's roller derby be so lethargic? And yet, it is. Most of the action scenes are destroyed by the horrible casting of Jimmy Fallon who's play-by-play banter is just plain annoying and grating and ... bad. Page is good, but her brittle, smarty-pants schtick is showing it's limitations in a role that calls for more warmth. Wiig and MGH fare best. Then the directing: She tries, but the energy never gets to where it should be. Especially when the off-track scenes go nowhere you haven't been 30 million times before. Take a pass. Too bad, really."
4,Not Sure The Bad Review Are Deserved,"I'm not sure why this movie got such bad reviews in the media. It's like everyone wants some profound look into the human condition or some amazing twist every time they watch a film. Whip It is just a solid film. It's fun, paced well, and the cast is top notch. It's not a perfect movie, but pretty close. (it follows script structure pretty closely)"
4,Great Movie!!,"I loved Ellen Page in Juno, and she's really good in Whip It. I loved the music in this movie, the story line, the supporting characters, and the end. It also gave you some fun facts about roller derby, which I hadn't heard about before seeing this movie. Overall I would definitely recommend Whip It to anyone who likes movies about people following the desires of their hearts, and being willing to take chances."
4,"Sweet, fun and good natured","""Likable"" could be seen as a lukewarm compliment for a film. ""Cute"" couldeven be a backhanded pit-down. But this film is likable and cute in a very good way.The story of an off-beat 17 year old, well played by Ellen Page, finding herselfby secretly joining the roller derby in Austin, Texas may be cliched on the surface,but the lovely character detail and successfully offbeat casting make the film a quirky,likable winner.Not a great film, nor an ""important"" one, but one I enjoyed and was never bored by. Andat a time where most Hollywood ""entertainment"" centers around blowing stuff up, its niceto see a mainstream film with rich characters and a big heart."
3,Good,"This was a fun film. It was a tried and true 'Footloose' concept, of youth rebelling against family/community mores, who after the trauma and punishment of being found out opens minds and becomes supported by the family/community. Seeing that play out in a more feminine atmosphere was interesting. I felt like there was a little too much Page (particularly since she always plays the same geek teen character) though not enough Barrymore in front of the camera. Likewise, Lewis was a notch over the top. She seemed like she was acting for her life, and came off melodramatic. The story was a bit all over the place with humor, drama, action, sports, but in the end it was fun and worth watching."
3,Helen through the Looking Glass,"An anatomical artist, Helen Martin, goes to Europe to find her missing husband and meets an assortment of strange and, perhaps, supernatural characters. This is fantastic, whimsical light fiction; if whimsy is not your thing, you may feel like you've been sucked into a bad episode of ""Twin Peaks""; however I enjoyed Helen's quest quite a bit. The ending of this story is more conclusive than the ending of Hodgson's last fiction, The Tattooed Map. The Sensualist is comparable to Nick Bantock's The Venetian's Wife, although I think the Bantock book is a little better. Warning: If you're a fan of toy and movable books you should know that although The Sensualist has several beautifully rendered drawings and fold-outs (I loved the fold-out brain drawing on page 122), there aren't as many pictures in this as in The Tattooed Map. The Sensualist is more of a full-sized novel (295 pages) than the slim The Tattooed Map."
1,Not worth the money,"I found this book to be schizophrenic at best. Not well written and an absolutely non-sensical storyline. The plot was rather dumb and dull, and I found myself not caring one whit about the main character in the book. I'm wondering if Ms Hodgson was perhaps a bit delusional herself when putting this book together.I DO like well-done fantasies and mysteries...unfortunately, this was neither."
1,Suckered,"I cant tell you how bitter I am about getting suckered into reading this book. The title and description are intriguing. However, soon after starting you learn that this is merely a pathetic attempt at passing off christian propaganda as literature. It was the single worst book i've ever read.EVER. The characters are ridiculously obnoxious and worthless- the only thing keeping you turning the pages is the hope that one of them will meet a painful and prolonged end. I despised everything and everyone in this book. The cover of this book should contain a warning advertising the fact that this is propaganda and listening to the dialogue between characters will make you nauseaus"""
5,an absolutly amazing series,"this is really a great miniseries. the gun fighting and action is great but there also is a great story to it too. you get to see what it was like for the men that fought in that war. you also learn a lot too. before i saw this series i thought war was just tons of men killing each other untill everyone on one side where dead. after i saw it i realized it was more than that. before i saw this i also thought ""what war movie could possibly be interesting"". this series is so great that i spent over $$$ to buy it and watched it over and over again."
5,Full BoB collection for fans,this is the ultimate collection for anyone looking for something more than the three hours or so war movies are restrained by. it follows the story of the airborne division from training in georgia to the final capture of hitlers eagles nest. also the extras r really good and informative. a must have for any war movies lover
4,Excellent series with one blemish,"I have no idea why but David Schwimmer the actor always makes my skin crawl when he is onscreen. I think his ability to play a leader is absolutely terrible. Maybe that's why he was cast. He is probably a nice guy but I just want to punch him when I see him.Other than that, this series is amazing."
5,Watchable with Clear Play,The Clear Play DVD player has Filters for this and The Pacific. So you you can block out the pornography and F words.
2,Where is it?,"The first time I watched this series I borrowed copies from a friend who recorded it off of the tv. This version has been re-edited to shorten the length of each episode. I am GREATLY disappointed. Some of these parts were things that I was looking foreword to watching again. The pacing was changed in other parts that left a different impression on what happened. If I was watching it for the first time I may have enjoyed it, but knowing what I'm missing and just how much richer the story was before, I have to give it only one or two stars."
2,Wrong Item details,"Not sure if it was Amazon com's wrong item details or seller's, but received PAL system DVD despite NTSC advertisement."
5,Set worth buying,I love this set.Totally worth the money.Honestly some of the best films I have seen.One of the greatest series ever.Anyone interested in history or World War 2 will love this.
5,Sooo good,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, at his request. I'm the one who's pestering him every night, asking if we can watch another Band of Brothers episode. Fantastic show!"
5,Spellbinding,My father and and his brothers all served in WWII never talked about it I now have an real idea what they went thru as well as all the others . Watch this and have a real fell for what they sacrificed for all of us.
5,Band of Brother is incredible,"This is a great mini-series that really brings an honest look to the true stories of our troops in the 101st Airborne. Everything about this series is done with integrity and shows much of the great commeraderie and strength, the personalities and personal thoughts of the troops, as well as some of the more difficult sides of war and ultimately our part in the victory of WWII from the soldiers' persective. Each episode begins with a documentary style shot of one of the real veterans who are the ""characters"" in the film and it adds that necessary reminder that ""this is real, this really happened"" element that we sometimes forget when watching these kinds of documentaries/movies. It is also very compelling, entertaining, comical, heart-touching and realistic. I've seen it on DVD and Blu-ray disc and the Blu-ray is just as good as it always is. If you have a Blu-ray player, invest in Band of Brothers."
5,Band of Brothers set,I bought this for my husband's birthday and was absolutely thrilled with it. Still sealed in plastic wrap and in absolute mint condition. We will enjoy many hrs. of entertainment this winter viewing this.
4,Band of Brothers,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased Band of Brothers. It's great story about the horors of war, starting with training, on to Normandy, Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, the freeing of the concentration camps, and all the way to the Allies Occupation of Germany. I am not sure it is necessary to purchase Band of Brothers in Blu-ray, but I will enjoy watching it many times."
4,Viewing Closed Captioning,"This DVD does have Closed Captioning, but if you view it through an HDMI cable the Closed Captioning is not available. The HDMI cable connects the DVD player to the TV. To view the Closed Captioning you must send the signal though a standard cable. The standard cable has the Red, Yellow and White RCA plugs on the ends. Make sure you have a standard cable connection between the DVD player and your TV. On the Input options on the TV, select ""Video"" and not HDMI. The picture will be a little less sharp, but the Closed Captioning will be visible. On my SONY Blu-Ray DVD player you must only use the Pause button to stop and start the video. If you press ""Play"" the Input selector reverts back to the HDMI connection and you lose the Closed Captioning. If this happens just change the Input selection on the TV remote back to Video. Good luck! The Closed Captioning really does add to the viewing experience."
5,Band of Brothers,"Perfect TV series, I've had it about a month now and I've already watched it about 3 times. probably wouldn't bother with the blue ray though if I had it to do again since the series was made before HD. I watched it on HD and it virtually made no difference. But this is definitely a smart purchase."
5,Great,"This series is one of the best portrayals of WW2 ever put on film. They stayed true to the original story and the veterans personal stories, and the series was very good as authenticity goes as well. It really draws you in and attaches you to the men of Easy company, so that by the final episode, it is really sad to hear what happened to some of them after the war."
5,Historical honesty,"As a history teacher who, by the way, does NOT enjoy violent war movies as a rule, I can only say that this series is mesmorizing. It is the best movie I have ever seen, and I have been waiting and hoping that the powers that be would choose to release it on video. I used segments of the film in my AP US History class last year and my students were equally enthralled by it. It's not only compelling in it's own right, but it tells a very important story about what civilized society asks of its soldiers. If you don't purchase it, please make a concerted effort to view it at some point. It's EXCELLENT."
5,Band of Brothers DVD Set,"Very good series, could not watch all of it on HBO. Now I can watch at my leisure."
5,A Special Movie with Personal Reasons,"This movie was superbly done. It touched upon all the major historical events. The documentary section was extremely well done. To see the soldiers and hear their stories, it really gives you a sense of going through the war with them. On a personal note, it was quite special to find footage of my husband's grandfather, who was in the 101st Airborne Division."
5,Great buy!,This is the best price I have seen for this item. I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he can't stop watching it. Great for war movie lovers!
5,We are so fortunate to be able to see this masterpiece,"I will keep this short...We are so fortunate to have film makers like Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and historian and writer, Stephen Ambrose, who with their vision, was able to put together this masterpiece so that the world could see just a slice of what World War II in the eyes of Easy Company was all about. This is the finest piece of filmmaking, based on historical events and real lives. Rent it or buy it, start from the beginning, I guarantee you that you will want to have the whole series for your library. Once a year, we watch from beginning to end and we are reminded of the sacrifices that so many made, so that we could be here today."
5,Great Value,"This video collection is just amazing..comes in a metal box, good insert, and the price I paid is unbelievable..you wont be sorry, great collection"
2,Another american war- story,"This DVD is another typical american war- story were american soldiers defeat their enemy. Other features in this series are Panther tanks (Best tank of WWII) that doesn't fire when confronted with Shermans, and therefore are blown sky high. A few evil germans who flee as soon as they see a US- soldier are also added, as usual. The americans never loose a scirmish, in the end they are always saved by someone or something. So to sum this up: This DVD- box is a must for those of you who love seeing americans killing germans and looting their pockets afterwards. It also features american soldiers executing lots of german POW's and of course no one is punished afterwards. If you like that, then this is the thing for you, for all of you who have seen american war- movies in the past, stay away, you have seen it all before."
3,Was it really this way??,"Hi everyone!I just saw mostly all of the episodes by now. I am impressed about the high quality of almost everything: the actors are very good, the equipment looks very close to the original (as far as I can say), and the mood of war is transportated to the observer very well (or terribly, from the point of the observer). And even one typical ""US-war-film""-stereotype is missing: the Germans are not ugly and bad... But unfortunatly, others remain: the Germans are stupid in every way of the word and love to run into enemy fire. I came to the question: what was the problem at all about Germany in 1939 to 1945? And what did US-troops learn from the Germans, that they still teach it at military-accademies?? They were just hordes of gun-food... Wow, I don't want to see how absolutly over-stupid the rest of Europes soldiers must have been, that it came this far with Europe..."
1,Could have been better,"I've never been a big fan of war series, but my multimedia instructor made me watch this gruesome tale. This has a great depiction of the first half of WWII and I have to admit from time to time the scenes will hold me suspended, but for some reason I never enjoyed the series. I expected there'd be a lot more blood, but all I saw was shooting, nighttime, profanity, name mix-ups, and quite some confusion pertaining to what was happening and why did it happen."
1,WWII meets Beverly Hills 90210,"This is a show that combines WWII melodrama with modern teen-TV dramas to create a horrid mixture of bad acting and war-glorification. It makes war look like a paid vacation with your buddies. Also: it waaay overglorifies American soldiers, who were far from being the best soldiers in the war. None of these characters/soldiers would have held up for 24 hrs. on the eastern front.I was never given any reason to care about any of the characters. Some were so cuddly ""terry bear"" ish that it was sickning. This is a perfect example of America's isolation for the realities of the rest of the world and of war in general.There is no real pathos or drama here, only blood and gut scenes and melodrama(much much more melodrama than B&Gs;). The story is very poorly written and tries to deal ""sensitively"" with too many different characters.Makes you feel like war is something the Beverly Hills 90210 teens did on their spring break."
5,No-brainer if you have BluRay,"Get it now! Picture and sound quality are fantastic on my my Sony A3000 60"" HDTV.Love the picture in picture info and also all the info with the timeline. I dont think these were available with the standard DVD set."
4,Great history lesson.,"We were given this set on video many years ago for Christmas. My husband wanted it on DVD so he could watch it on our portable DVD player whenever he wanted without disturbing anyone else. It is a great story, especially for those that like history as my husband does. He is a big fan of WWII and when we were stationed in Japan, we acquired the Victory at Sea series and have watched it many times over the years. For those that would like to learn more about the reality of WWII, I highly recommend either one of the these series."
5,Band of Borthers is Excellent,"This is an amazing series from HBO and is extremely well done. Either for the average person or the knowledgable historian this World War II series that follows from stateside training to the end of combat in WWII or a unit of the 101 Airborne is fascinating, accurate, gut-wretching and attention grabbing all at the same time. Highly recommended!!!"
5,best tv mini series ever,top notch acting and absolutely full on special effects make this a first rate hollywood movie adapted to mini series format. If you liked saving private ryan you will like this one
5,This is a must buy DVD set!!!,"I have been waiting for the release of this DVD set ever since I saw the first episode on HBO. This is by far the best WWII series or movie I have ever seen produced. If you have not seen it BUY THE DVDs. If you have BUY THE DVDs. You'll enjoy the experience and sympathize with the characters. Also, read the book by Steven Ambrose. It will make watching the series that much better."
5,I Never Forgot!,"I'd like to thank Ambrose, Hanks and Spielberg for bringing Easy Company's story to us--it's a story that needed to be told.I was ten years old when Easy Co. and other airborne units landed in France on D-Day. I remember my grandfather reading to me, the newspaper account of the heavy fighting our airborne troops were involved in. I'm 70 now and have never forgotten what these men did for our country. They were herosEasy Company, I salute you!"
5,Excellent!,"The Band of Brothers mini-series is absolutely wonderful. I think it should be required viewing for all high school or college students. If you don't like Band of Brothers, you're a communist."
5,A great book successfully ported to the screen,"Hanks and Spielberg have produced an amazing adaptation of Ambrose's book. The mini series' depiction of Easy Company's ride through the war is about as honest and realistic as it can get. The 10 episodes are tough going, especially the depiction of a concentration camp in episode nine. The usage of interviews with veterans is a reminder that the events really happened, and that war is a horrible thing."
5,Veteran Review,This series reminds you how freedom was bought with the blood and sweat of our veterans. The enhancement of having people who were there to tell how it was greatly enhanced the points the writers and directors were trying to make.It is so important for people to see what courage people take to provide this nation with the freedom we cherish.
5,We loved it!,"My husband and I just loved this set of DVD's. It makes you really appreciate the men who serve and have served our country to defend our freedoms. Hanks and Spielberg have done justice to the men of ""Easy Company"". What a great movie!"
4,Disc 2 Will Not Play,"Aside from this being an amazing series, which I watched on HBO, as well as purchased the same DVD box set when it was released; I cannot get this new Blu Ray disc #2 to play. It keeps coming up as an ""unrecognized"" disc in my Sony BDP-BX1 (Costco's S350 equivalent). I'm an avid firmware updater for just about everything in the house and I am definitely up to date on the Blu Ray player. All other discs tested fine, but I'm a bit irritated at having paid for a full box set and only being able to utilize 5 of the 6 discs. I'm willing to bet that if I can even find a customer service contact number for HBO, they're going to want some money for a replacement disc.Don't get me wrong, this is a 5 star series (by far) but I could only give this product purchase one less star than 5, since I can use 1 less disc than what I paid for."
5,Band of Brothers,"This is a great movie, well documented, with excellent acting. I highly recommend purchasing this mini series and watching it many times over."
5,Band of Brothers is for everybody,Band of Brothers is one of the most profound looks at World War II I have ever seen. The progression of the characters as they develop shows how different war effects each one. There are some great laughs and some of the most stirring situations I have ever experienced in film. I consider it to be an absolute classic. I loved it and I am so glad I have it to see again and again.
5,Band of Brothers DVD set,"I originally bought this product through Target but found it being offered through Amazon a day later for a cheaper price so I placed my order through Amazon and decided I'd return the one I bought through Target. I have to say my son whom the dvd set was purchased watched the series within the first weekend he'd received it and again and again.So you can say he's a satisfied customer and I am happy I was able to save $20 and receive it in 2 days. Thanks, Amazon"
5,"The only project that could have bested ""Saving Private Ryan"".","I have the DVD version and now have the Blu-Ray version. Yes it's THAT good.Tom Hanks didn't feel he was done with the story after ""Saving Private Ryan"". The amount of reasearch, devotion and energy that went into this project will not soon be eclipsed."
5,bought as a gift,I bought this as a christmas gift for my dad and i was happy to find this in VHS format as he still has his VCR.I really like the way it is packaged.
5,Riveting!,We've watched this over the years and decided we needed to have our own copy. We got it faster than the anticipated date and immediately began viewing it; one or two episodes a day.I'm sure most of us have seen this miniseries. I enjoy it more than any other I've ever seen. I hate to see each episode end.The actual set (10 disks) I ordered is beautiful. An elegant metal box holds it all. It contains a lot of extras like insightful commentary by several of the actual men of Easy Company.I recommend this unreservedly.
5,One of the best WWII films made (period),"The content, players and script was of the best this old man (77) have seen. It protrays human emotions, stress, frustrations of men who live and die for what they truly believe in. The USA!!!!!"
1,Sub-Par,"After receiving this Christmas present, one of the disk was scratched in the box. I attempted to contact Amazon for a replacement disk but was unable to get a hold of anyone. So now I have a scratched disk and can't see part of the campaign. This is my first time being disappointed with a product i've purchased from Amazon, and it will make me reconsider purchasing in the future."
2,Band of Brothers: Brings WW2 Into Your Living Room,"First off Tom Hanks has just got WW2 in his bones. It`s about time we started to see the real war and not some watered down version.This DVD set is just incredible, all the interactive menus, the maps and the documentaries just put this whole set in a class by itself.I have watched and studied much about WW2 and this is highley accurate and very moving to watch.You feel like your there, with surround sound you ARE there! I cannot say enough about this set.If your a WW2 fan, then this set is a must!!"
1,poor video sound synchronization,"Had original Band of Brothers--great--5 stars, best war movie ever made. My blu ray edition had poor video sound synchronization---voices did not synchronize with speech on screen--terrible effect--like a poorly dubbed movie. Suspect a manufacturing defect. Not an issue with my Blu-ray player--it works great with all my other movies. I returned Blu-ray version."
2,Not another Rambo Movie!,Although the sound and special effects are very good the screenplay is almost near to a fairytale. The American soldiers apear more like perfect killing machines and the German troops like Sissies. Where is the documentary in that? For example: (An American soldier throws a grenade over 100 meters in a small window even being sitting behind sacks under fire!...)Wow! I didn't think Jordan could do it! I rest my case.
1,No English subtitles,"My son and daughter-in-law spent alot of money on this set for me for Father's Day. I was excited & couldn't wait to start watching the series! However, I'm hard of hearing so need subtitles & spent an hour trying to access them. The only subtitles available are Spanish. Bottomline: THEir MONEY WAS WASTED!!!!!! They no longer have the sales slip & the store they bought it in won't exchange without a sales slip. Color me disappointed and angry."
5,best WWII movie I've ever seen,"I happened to see the movie on the History Channel quite by accident, but from the beginning I was engrossed. I watched every night absolutely in tears. When the last episode was over, I wanted to go back and watch from the beginning again. I feel that I know each of the men who were portrayed in the movie and the book. The more I watch, the more familiar they are to me. They are truly a company of heroes."
5,Good BlueRay Video,I had seen the serie before. But in BlueRay it was amazing!!The item arrived fast and fine to Peru. I strongly recommend it
5,"Real Men, Real review","I've watched this series about 5 times. Having been a paratrooper and been in the stress of combat (albeit, not the duration they had) I can attest that this portrays things accurately.The men depicted in this movie were inspirational to me, and show what we are truely capable of. My hat's off to all of them, and those like them."
5,Band of Brothers,What a sense of awe and respect one has for these men after seeing this mini series!
5,One of the best series!,This is fantastic. I have watched this over and over. You truly get to know the characters. The interviews with the true soldiers are inspiring. This is one of the best things HBO has put out.
5,Currahee,Very well done. Having visited Normandy and Bastogne three times one totally realizes the supreme sacrifice made by so many to restore freedom in Europe. It is a shame that this history is not taught in schools. At least here in the U.S.
5,Band of brothers,I find that this video is so emotional and heart warming. These soldiers gave so much. Their story was presented accurately in this movie.
3,Band of Brothers DVD Collection,Love the series but one of the DVDs came with subtle marks/scratches and it does not play well. Difficult to return only 1 bad one out of the set.
1,two stars for this dvd version,"I bught this for my dad only to find this version has NO english language subtitles or captions.This is incredible since while Band of Brothers has a wide audience, there is a definate older veterans audience, many of whom use closed captions/english subtitles to help with their hearing loss.The original HBO series had captions, so the work was already done. putting the captions on the dvd takes a miniscule amount of space and checking various DVDs I own 99% have English language captions. What the heck!?I love the series but if the the US version of Scooby Doo has closed captions/English subtitles, why, for goodness sakes, would this High Priced DVD set have left it out!!"
4,Band of Brothers: BluRay,"It came no problem and is a beautiful picture but two days after I ordered it, the price dropped to 60% off which irritated me."
4,BAND OF BROTHERS ALL THE WAY,"i loved the relistic war seens in this movie alot but what i dident like it was relistic and all but i thought the germans were better trained then that i mean really carentain and market garden but battle of the bulge the guy just ran right through there and the ss dident do anything about it not a single shot, nice affects on the hollacast though realistic"
5,FANTASTIC!,A terrific set for anyone who loves great military action and wants to see the sometimes softer side to our military members.Band of Brothers is a great story.I recommend it highly and I'm a woman.
4,Why film grain?,"Okay, I like this series, but the film grain is too much. When people looked through their own eyes during WW2, did they see film grain? Our eyes do not have film grain. It would have been one thing if there was a flash back during the movie that had film grain, but the entire dang series? Artistic style? Whatever. Human beings do not see with film grain. I'm positive that even 60 years ago, Humans eyes did not add film grain to what they saw. When I watch a movie, I want to see the movie, not imperfections in the film, or artificial grain added by the director."
2,Wrong disc,"I received this item today and when we opened it, there were two disc 2 and not a disc 3. We have contacted amazon.com and we are returning this item for a refund. I'm not sure what happened, but apparently a duplicate disc was put in place of Disc 3. It was considered new and it was wrapped. Disappointed that we have to send it back, but mistakes happen."
4,Band Of Brothers,I received what I purchased. DVD's which functioned correctly and the hardened case was is very good shape.
5,Make It A Ten Plus,"Being on the road all the time I never caught much of the series when it was on the History Channel. After seing the last two chapters though I had to buy the set and see what the entire story was about. I can honestly say I more than got my money's worth on this set.I could go on and rave about all the fine merits of the series, but apparently there's been so many great reviews that any more would most likely get lost in the shuffle. So I'll just say this to anyone who might be sitting on the fence about buying the set....It's so real and so rich in acting and script that you get many more times the bang for your bucks...."
5,The best!!!!,The best long term movie - series that deals with war I have ever seen. A masterpiece...
3,case missing but cd's perfect,"CD's in great condition and played no problem, case missing and the picture showed the case I did expect the case to come with the CD"
4,BOB is still good on DVD too!,"Even though its not in Blu ray format, it is still a good picture and sound quality. From the 1st disc to the last, this series will keep you wathching with great interest till the very end. Worth every penny."
5,Best Piece of Film Ever,"I bought this dvd series because I heard it was really good and had the money to spare. I'll always cherish this collection. Simply put, these ten episodes documenting the sacrifice that these men gave for our country and for peace are quite possibly the best pieces of film to ever grace anyone's eyes. I do not cry easily at all when watching movies or anything, last time I cried was when I was ten years old and I watched Swing Kids. This movie had me choked up and teary-eyed at the very end of the last episode. It's not based on a true story, it is a true story to the letter. The veterans who were interviewed make it that much more real to the viewer. No one has ever made a movie or show or any form of media that is so moving and powerful. To not buy this or see it would be a disservice to yourself."
5,Excellent and powerful,"This has to be one of the best series of all time. I first saw this series on HBO and recently saw it again on the History Channel... I have decided I must have the series for myself. There were times when I actually felt the emotion of the scene. The war action, scenary, and accuracy are breathtaking. Simply exquisite!"
5,the finest world war II film ever made,"this story of one rifle company during d-day and beyond is the finest world war II film and maybe the best war film ever made. this hbo miniseries pulls no punches as it tells the story of real heros of the war, the guys who had to spend everyday in the hell of combat and what it did to them. no glamor here just men or really boys saving the world and wanting to get home in one piece. you will never find a better story of war and the boys who have to fight. it belongs in everyones collection, and in a place of honor in the american list of great films. please check this fine film out, you won't be sorry."
5,Band of Brothers,"This has to be the best DVD mini-series on WWII. It was very well put together and enjoyable to watch. I like to watch programs on WWII on the History Channel and this is one of my favorites. If you like this box set, you will also enjoy ""The War"" by Ken Burns. It is a WWII documentary you should not miss."
5,More than expected,"My husband had watched the series on TV repeatedly, so I bought the set for Fathers Day. Besides the TV series, there were deleted scenes, an interactive map showing everywhere Easy Company was deployed, and a dictionary explaining every term used. My husband has already gotten many hours of enjoyment out of the ""extras"" that he never expected, or usually looks at on a DVD."
5,An amazing production of remarkable experiences,"My wife summarized my feelings about this DVD series the best about a week after we finished the last DVD. She said, ""I wish I could keep watching more about them. I feel like I know those guys, and now I miss them.""I thought, what a testament to(a) the power and impact that the ""characters"" had on us(b) the performances of the actors(c) the production team that put it all together.Everyone undoubtedly knows the remarkable story of how these men bonded in during such a pivotal part of recent history. Their story makes for a very dramatic tale. However, HBO, Hanks and Spielberg expertly weave Ambrose's book into a riveting account that grips the viewer, even a week after they finished watching."
4,Fantastically clear but starting and sound an issue,I absolutely fell in love with the DVD. Very clear and never missed a part of one of my favourite tv war series. I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that every time I start the thing it has to start right from the beginning of the episode and not from the place I stopped. And there is a sound jump from regular dialogues to war sounds....maybe thats how its designed but puts me in a spot as the other building dwellers dont take too kindly to loud noises.
5,What i asked for!!!,"I bought this for a father's day gift and he loved it - perfect price and value..... all the dvds are packed with content, thanks again!!!"
5,With sincere appreciation,I ordered the incorrect item for my husband. after contacting this person they were very kind to tell e to refuse it. Instead of returning it I have decided to give it to another family member. Thank you for your assistance in this item. Will definitely order from this person again.
5,Well written mini-series,Band of Brothers is a great miniseries that I highly recommend to those who like dramatic war films.
5,Band Of Brothers - A true story of heroes,"This series, originally aired on HBO, represents the best in film making and is a true tribute to a group of guys, soldiers, (heroes, really) training to be Airborne, becoming Airborne and as apart of Easy Company, basically helping to save the free world. A true story.If you enjoyed ""Saving Private Ryan"" as I did, you will truly be awed by these ten episodes about a group of men from the ""Greatest Generation.""Excellence in film making."
5,"Great series, great history, great DVD","This mini rocks--it's what Private Ryan could have been (so close!). The DVD is wonderful, with some very nice features. Only complaint: the Field Guide intro calls WWII ""The War to End all Wars"". History buffs will say ""Oops!"" and move on. You must buy this."
1,Not handicap accessable,"I give this movie a 1 for its accessibility. I love the movie and give it a 5 star rating, however, it is not accessible to those of us with hearing loss. I have purchased two versions (over $100) just trying to get to watch this movie. If I spoke Spanish I would be fine. the captions do not work on any TV and show up as being blank. When I watch it, my family gets tired of having to interpret it for me and explain what is being said. I know that there is English captions out there, I have seen them on TV. So why can we not get them with the movie? I am feeling a little left out on this wonderful movie."
1,price,this item is more here than it is at walmart.i would think buying online it would have been at least a few dollars cheaper.
4,Band of Brothers,"My husband loved his movie set, Band of Brothers. I couldn't believe the price that I got it for. It was amazing.CLT"
5,So glad I bought this set...,"A must buy on Bluray for any fan of action and war movies. Im not a fan of David Schwimmer, spelling?, anyway, very interesting and the special effects are on par with Saving Private Ryan. Great writing also."
2,Get Saving Private Ryan instead of this,"Band of Brothers was very disappointing. The attention to detail was excellent but I found the episodes did not gel well together. I do think that this series really missed a great opportunity to continue the ""real"" experience that Saving Private Ryan left us with. I felt completely unmoved by the characters and felt no connection to them, and as a result I really did not care what happened to them."
1,great,THE BAND OF BROTHERS IS A GREAT MOVIE I DONT GET AND DO NOT WANT HBO SO THIS IS SUCH A TREAT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH IT WHEN I WANT TO SEE THESE MEN COME TOGETHER -(BAND OF BROTHERS)AND FIGHT A WAR WHAT A GREAT JOB BY DAMIEN LEWISRON LIVINGSTONEDONNIE WAHLBERGAND THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE IS IN GREAT SHAPE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE NOT SEE THIS MOVIE BUY IT AND SIT BACK AND ENJOY AT YOUR LEASURE
1,Lousy Series,"How you seen how clean the uniforms of the soldiers were in the entire series. I think that this miniseries poorly portray the image Stephen Ambrose book ""Band of Brothers"" wants us to have.If you want to watch how real soldiers fight in the war you should watch ""The War at World"" series."
1,terrible job of packing,"The ""keepsake"" tin the DVDs arrived in was all bent up due to poor packaging for shipping. Hopefully packing and shipping will be better for others since I have let them know.... but will they make any shipping changes--who knows."
1,very pathetic,"Only one star for quite nice special effects. Spielberg and Hanks have done some patriotic, most unrealistic and pathetic ""thing"", far more pathetic than Saving Private Ryan. I hope you know that neither the US- nor the german soldiers were like shown in this sorry effort. Save your money, go buy some books about the topic instead. That way you can learn better about the liberation of old-europe and Germany at the end of WWII."
5,Band of Brothers (DVD),"This series of World War II was so powerful, so accurate, but also so intense that I was blown away. I truly did not want to get to the 10th epiosode because I did not want the series to end. Damian Lewis was excellent as were all the actors and I thank Tom Hanks and Steven Spielburg for having the foresight to make such a dramtic portrayal of a heroic time in our history. My thanks to all the soldiers who so bravely fought & died for our freedom. It was positively excellent and I recommend everyone see it."
3,"Okay, but doesn't give overall war history","Band of Brothers like the Pacific is a good series. But, it's a good thing I knew a fair amount of ww2 history before watching BOB, as BOB teaches almost nothing about the overall war outside of easy company duties. If you want a movie that teaches about ww2 history in depth, watch Winds of war and War & Remembrance. 10 times more informative and better than BOB."
5,band of brother,I bought this for my husband who's in the military. He absolutely loves them....as do I. The case came well packaged and the cd's were in great condition. I recommend these dvd's to everyone!! They are so good I have to make myself stop watching them.
5,Amazing,"Superbly done; incredible location scenes; ever detail captured. Did I mention riveting? Just when you thought WWII movies had all been done,this brings another side to the greatest war ever fought."
5,Loved It!!!!,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it. I had it shipped to his sister's house in North Carolina and she got it in a great timing and it was in great condition. He loves it and the DVD's play great! He watched it within a week that he got it! Asbolutely love it!!!
2,if I had only known,I wish I would have known that when purchasing dvd's there are different regions throughout the world. The set that I purchased at such a great price will not work on my dvd player. The company has told me to mail them back along with the duty etc. . . and this makes it unreasonable for me to do so. So I am just stuck with a product that will not play in Ohio mailed to me from GB. I learned a lot in this transaction.
5,Subtitle problem,The DVD set is great but came with Spanish subtitles. Now the set has to be returned and exchanged for English subtitles.
4,Band of Brothers two thumbs up,This is a great colletion if you liked the movie Saving Private Ryan. It certainly makes you appreciate what our veterans did for our country
2,Be wary of buying used DVDs,"Obviously these DVD's had been used at a rental store so several are scratched and don't work. They will either freeze or jus stop. I tried cleaning them and used another DVD player, I own a Bose Lifestyle system so it plays almost any DVD Netlfix has, but they still didn't work. Best to buy them new. This mini series is excellent and every DVD in the progression of the story is better than the last."
4,Looking Forward to Watching!,"Package arrived in time. However, when it arrived, I was very nervous. The box from Amazon was covered in black dust/dirt. Looked like it was thrown into a fire pit before it was shipped. Once I was able to open the box, the product looked great. Unfortunately, when I went to watch the first segment, my blu-ray player wouldn't eject the DVD I already had in it! So, I haven't been able to watch Band of Bros yet since I have to ship my player in to get repaired. Looking forward to watching though!"
3,Not a new product,"This review is not concerned with Band of Brothers, which is one of the best World War II mini-series I have ever seen. This review is for the product.From the image, and price, I was lead to believe I was purchasing a new copy of Band of Brothers on blu-ray. My excitement from its delivery was deflated as soon as I opened the box. Not only was this product previously opened but the outside case was dented. I think all of the blu-rays are intact but buyer beware, you may get a previously opened product.The only reason I don't rate this product with one star is because Band of Brothers is so amazing. I have owned this on DVD and wanted to enjoy the series in high def once I got my blu-ray player.If you are thinking about buying Band of Brothers, do it! You wont be disappointed. Just be aware that your copy may not be new."
2,"Movies fine, Amazon sucked","Ordered this set twice. Both times arrived damaged and could not give as a gift.I sent both back and ordered from Walamart site to store it was even less money. Came in without a mark.Will not purchase from Amazon again, I think they have gotten cheap on thier packaging."
2,DVD's in tin,"I ordered this ""new"" set for a Christmas gift. Shipping was extremely slow and when it arrived the container ""tin"" was dented in 3 different places. Since shipping was so slow, I am giving it ""as is"" I will not order from this seller again."
4,"Excellent Product, but......","When I bought it, I did with the purpose of using this in the classroom with my students ( teaching english as a second language) and one of the reason that I purchased the product was because I read the details of it and it said that closed captioned was included on the film and it wasn't. There are Spanish and french subtitles, but not english ones. I use the film to teach english to my students and when it's really difficult for them to understand, closed captioned helps me to guide them in their understanding. So please make sure that next time you put the descriptions of a product, be more specific. I really think that information given is misleading and even thought the product is more than I expected, the closed captioned is essential to my purpose of having it. Another thing Could you guide where to find the transcript of the series, so I can use in the classroom? I would appreciate that information very much.....Thanks"
5,Better than any TV show I've ever seen.,"This is probably HBO film's magnum opus. You really get attached to these guys, although they tend to drop like flies. And even if you're not a war buff you'll love the story telling. As far as the fighting goes they don't pull punches, its more than graphic ....... its dalton trumbo graphic ....... different war, but you get the point. It really brings to light the sacrifices these guys made for the rest of us. I was so happy to see the ones who made it in Austria. One of my favorite episodes, even thought there's very little action at that point. When they took the 'Eagle's Nest' I admit I was grinning. This is really a film. Its so much better than any tv show i've ever seen. I give it my highest recomendation."
5,WW II veteran,"I purchased this set for my father, a WWII veteran. He feels that it is very well done. The range of actors involved is superb and really brings the experience to life. It's so realistic that my father has to fast forward through a few scenes because he re-lives his own memories. He and I would recommend Band of Brothers to anyone interested, not only in WW II, but in a good action/drama movie."
5,Great DVD,"Extremely entertaining. Was expecting some like Saving Private Ryan, but it was a real treat to experience a realistic portrayal of WW2. Worth every penny and second."
5,great price on these dvd's,"i bought these as a gift for my husband, he loved them on hbo. now he is able to watch them whenever he wants, and doesn't have to worry about missing an episode. they had a great price and provided him with some entertainment."
5,Hanks & Spielberg Do It Again,"Band of Brothers is simply awesome! From the opening credits to the final scene on the ball field, you'll be held spell bound as the story of these heroes unfolds. Mr. Hanks and Mr. Spielberg have created a truly spectacular work. The relatively new cast is incredible, the soundtrack simply beautiful, and the story awe inspiring. The scenery in a few of the episodes is stunning. The DVD transfer is very well done and the DTS soundtrack is great! This is a must see movie for all Americans! Do yourself a favor and add it to your collection. You won't regret it!"
5,A Magic Gift!,"After viewing this collection, my husband and I were awestruck. We came home each night from work and were determined to watch another dvd.I purchased this set as a gift for a man who was a Marine during this time period. He was awarded the purple heart. He was so touched by this gift.Rarely do we find a series that is so filled with emotion and integrity."
5,Better then You Think,"This DVD collection is great, not only due you get every episode(2 per Disc) you also get an extra DVD with extras. There's not many extras, but there's a neat video diary that HBO gave Ron Livingston during his time a Actor Boot Camp. I would Highly HIGHLY recommend this."
5,Excellent,Love this program - the extra dvd about the making of the movie was very good. Have watched this program many times over & over.
5,Makes you admire and respect those who fought in WWII.,"WIth this series, Hanks and Speilberg make ""Saving Private Ryan"" just a scratch on the surface of what the whole world should know about WWII. What makes Band of Brothers most interesting is that these are real accounts based on actions and stories by real people. The included documentary, featuring interviews with real Easy Company veterans, provides the supporting sense of realism captured in all ten episodes. Band of Brothers will make you truly admire and respect the men of Easy Company, and all other soldiers who fought the great wars.This is top-notch stuff, particularly the action scenes that stop at nothing to make you feel like you're living the experience. By the end of the ten episodes, you feel like you've developed a bond with each of the characters. It's that good!Band of Brothers serves as an excellent reminder of a part of our history that should never be forgotten."
5,Has to be my most favorite WWII movie/documentary thing ever,"TIIIGHT! If you are interested/a scholar of WWII, this is a great movie for you. Although it doesn't give a whole lot of history, it's really not needed. Didn't comply with your typical WWII (or war) movie--not overly dramatic nor repetitive battle scenes. Sweet movie! Get it!"
5,Comments from a historian,"I watched this series several months ago and was entranced. Could not believe in these times of TV schlock what a quality production this was.A few weeks ago I was listening to a local talk radio show. The guest that day was a local college professor who has written several books on World War II, lectured on the subject, has one of his works optioned for a movie, etc. People were calling in to ask questions about different WWII movies and what were his opinion on the movies mentioned. Some he liked, some he panned. I called in and asked what he thought about Band of Brothers. Basically he was full of praise for this miniseries. In fact, he said he had ordered it for his class as a teaching tool. At that point the host of the show said if this professor was using it in his classroom then it had to be special."
5,Phenomenal,A moving and inspirational account of the heroes that fought valiantly and against formidable odds in the European Theater of Operations. If you enjoy WWII history you cannot go wrong. My only complaint is that I waited so long to see this amazing series.
5,Love it!,Greatest World War 2 movie EVER! I have watched this movie at least million times since it was released in 2001.
5,great series,This series is a great one. A stark reminder about how brave that generation was and how we should remember all of the evils that built up to those times.
5,Band of Brothers (Blu-ray),I bought this movie as a gift for my boyfriend and he was very happy with it.
3,band of brothers box set,i wanted to see this very bad when i got it in the mail there was no disk one the seller told me they had put this on the buying info but i did not see this i buy alot of stuff from amazon i dont want this to happen again
5,A Great Series,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my father, who is a WWII buff. He'd seen it on HBO when it originally aired, but he's excited to see it again."
4,Best TV show DVD with only one flaw.,"Enough good things have been already said about this TV series so I am not going to dig into that part.The flaw of this DVD set I am talking about is there is NO English subtitle available. Yes, you got that right, NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE. Only Spanish subtitle! I have been lucky enough to get a Southeast Asia edition of this DVD box set and guess what, THE ASIAN VERSION HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLE (along with 9 other different languages subtitle)!!!Figure this out!Since when do we become a Spanish speaking only country?I have no problem with the Spanish subtitle being there, but why left out the English subtitle? How are people with hearing problem who don't speak Spanish in this country going to watch this DVD box-set?"
3,Going to war and lovin' it (Band of Brothers),"Sometimes it feels like a recruitment commercial. The series shows the hellish side of combat, only to end with happy faces all around. In fact, it seems to be centered more about the military career (going up the ladder) than about the actual war happening. Being an American production, that is understandable. Of course the characters depicted are all good workers, ups, sorry, soldiers. For a better, non-jingoistic, and relevant look at war, see ""Generation Kill""."
2,Band of Brothers,"I was disapointted that the cd's did not come in the original metal container, they were just slapped together in little plastic containers. The additional cd telling how they made the movie and personal interviews was also not included."
3,Dear Amazon:,"I know times are tough, and I did opt for the free shipping....but stuffing the Tin in a mailer envelope and turning it over to Post office?As a serious collector I now have a Tin that is truly reflective of the era of the film. The usual small box would have been greatly appreciated."
2,Disc missing from set,"Band of BrothersOrdered a new set, not used and when the package was opened disc #6 was missing. This was a Christmas gift and I was able to get a return authorization but the person to whom the gift was given does not want to go through the headache of a return. He will keep as is, said the disc #6 does not have to do with the story but about the bonus features and he will do without. So very sad to give a gift and have it appear as it they were given something that had been used. :-("
1,No closed captioning,Very disappointed simply because I can't pick up half the dialogue (especially over the gunfire in most of the scenes).
1,NO English Subtitles!!,"I have never looked more forward to owning a DVD and I am giving this a horrible rating because of one thing. - It's lack of English subtitles.I watched every edition of this when on HBO and the encore as well, all the while having close-captioning on to aid me in the dialog when battle scenes got intense.I was utterly dismayed after I bought the DVD that no built in english subtitles are available.I really wonder who's snafu this was and what they say to the veterans seniors of this country that might want to watch it, but can't follow things well because of there hearing. My grandpa for one fits this bill.Great Series... Scrap that... Phenomenal Series! -Yet no CC! ...nuff said"
4,"6 stars for story, 3 stars for video.","I have HDTV version recorded. I can tell the film used to shoot this movie is same style the director used for his other movies, namely Saving Private Ryan. It is very noisy. Of course, 1080i/p version gives much more details on a good TV/projector."
4,Excellent,"I truly enjoyed this series. I've watched it several times on the DVD and on HBO and now on the History Channel. If you want to know what happened, this is the series to watch."
4,"Very detailed look at war, will be one for your collection","I watched this one a while back and was very impressed with the level of detail and just about everything else in this production. Band of Brothers follows the lives of a group of young men from just before D Day through the end of the war and really doesn't hold anything back. Everything is shown in detail, must've cost a medium sized fortune to achieve that. Often we are taken along as though we are actually there on the battlefield, or at least a newscameraman was, no details left out including bloody wounds and exploding buildings from artillery fire. I'd reccommend this program to just about anyone with an interest in history or warfare."
5,Delighted,"Placed order and received item very, very quickly. Thank you. Adult son is delighted with his Christams gift. Price was fair."
5,Band of Brothers DVD set,"Thanks to Spielberg, Frankel and Hanks for bringing to life an enduring story of bravery, heroism and brotherhood! The series is a first rate production from casting, acting, directing, sets, even packaging. It also has the power to teach by way of the 'extras', interviews, maps. A wonderful tribute to the greatest generation!"
5,"wow, speilberg and hanks got it right this time.","this is probably the best screen presentation of g.i.s in world war two ever made. the authenticity of the equipment, the uniforms and the fact that the actors actually sounded and acted like my father and uncles ( all veterans of ww II ) truly made this the best. the book itself is wonderful and perfectly represented in this series. we all owe steven ambrose a great deal of thanks for insisting they "" get it right"", and of course we owe the men who sacrificed so much to save us. the debt we owe them can never be repaid, ever!"
5,Best War Picture I've ever seen,"Every American needs to see this entire movie to be able to appreciate not only the soldiers who served but also the freedom in which we live. If it weren't for people like this, we wouldn't be living the way we do today. Anyone who doesn't understand or like the military needs to see this, and gain a new understanding."
5,AMAZING SERIES!!,"This is probably one of the best movie/series that I have watched about WWII. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone with a desire about WWII. The actors breathe life into the personas they play. While I was watching this series, I felt like I was actually a part of what was going on. I loved watching every minute."
5,One of my favorite TV programs,"Band of Brothers is an incredibly realistic portrayal of WWII. It is one of my favorite TV programs ever, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre. This is a 10 hour series in the style of Saving Private Ryan, and it is worth every minute. The show is definitely violent, and there is a substantial amount of blood, but it is always tasteful and never overdone. Hanks and Spielberg give you a picture of the war that is exciting and interesting, while at the same time avoiding the tendency that many directors have to glorify it. Easiest five stars I have ever given in a review."
5,Perfect Present,"Personally I had never seen the series, but my sweetie was dieing to own it so it was the absolute best thing to get for a Christmas gift. He's happy with it so I'm happy with it."
5,Band of Brothers DVD reviewed,"Well, if there was anyone in the world that has been waiting for this as long as me I would be surprised. As soon as I watched the first episode, the DVD collection went on my list of ""Must Haves"".And I wasn't disappointed with the specs, the picture is amazing, the sound pumps, and the features tell a story behind a story. Everything about this collection is what you expect when buying DVD's. I myself limit my choices to those DVD's loaded with features and this would have to be one of my favorites.All in all if you haven't seen Band of Brothers yet, see it for the first time with this collection, you won't be disappointed."
5,The Best Docu-drama,"With Shogun a distant 2nd (and that was phenomenal), this is by far the best docu-drama/miniseries filmed to date! In context alone, watching this not only informs the viewer of the hardships of WWII, but of the sacrifice of Easy Company and the soldiers just like them! Thanks for your service gentlemen!!"
5,Even better than what i expected,The product was delivered very fast and I was impressed by its quality and look. thank you very much. great seller. will defenitly make business again
5,Excellent Tribute,I watched the widescreen version of Band of Brothers on HBO and thought it was an excellent tribute to those brave men who sacrificed so much for us today. If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan then executive producer Steven Spielberg has given you another WWII epic to thoroughly enjoy. If you bought Saving Private Ryan and haven't seen Band of Brothers then BUY IT. It is an excellent DVD to add to your collection.
5,The best mini series ever made!,"This was the best series that I have seen in my meer 20 years on earth. Full of action, and 10 times better than Saving Private Ryan. Full of honor, duty, respect, courage, patriotism, and comrodery. I highly recommend this to everyone."
1,NOT for the hearing impaired,"I can't rate this product because I could not use it. It states on the product review page that it is""Closed Captioned"". It IS NOT closed-captioned. I am almost totally deaf and without closed captions it isuseless to me. It IS closed captioned in Spanish, but, unfortunately, I'm not fluent in Spanish.I bought it as a used product from Drake Books and now, even though it is not AS ADVERTISED, they want a25% re-stocking fee. Outrageous! Maybe I'll just ship it to Arizona and let them turn it over to I.C.E."
5,awesome collection,Band of brothers is the best HBO ever made WWII movies and it is in blu Ray. I got this for only 35 bucks can't beat the price. fast shipping!! A++++
4,Band of Brothers,Purchased Band of Brothers as a gift for my husband. I did not think I would care for it but was wrong. It after all was very good
3,No English Subtitles,"I bought this for my husband and he rated it 5 star plus. I'm very hard of hearing and need subtitles, even with my hearing aids, on most DVD's. Band of Brothers only has Spanish subtitles, which are useless to me. My lower rating of this DVD is because I have been unable to make out the dialog, which is so frustrating to those of us with hearing difficulties. I'm so surprised that an HBO production of such superior subject matter and quality of production would have no ""English for the hearing impaired"" subtitles. Sadly, I will never have the opportunity of enjoying this DVD."
5,Thank you Vets!,"I read Bob Lefleur's take on this set. He was there, in the real battle and we mere mortals can only imagine the Hell they went through during WWII. My dad and uncle were there. They had some very amusing stories about the great group of GI's they fought with, but some very grim details about the actual war. So, I want to thank Bob Lefleur and all the vet's that were there. Without them, things might be much different, in this world today. As for the Band of Brother's set? It is THE most realistic series about WWII ever produced. If you want to see how it really was, get this set, as it is awesome to watch."
3,Marriage Art,"This is not just a sex manual; it is a love manual. It's not clinical, per se. It's for someone whose interest is in expressing love to one's mate."
3,My son loved this...,the masks didn't last very long but the costumes are easy to put on (slip over the head) and he has played with them long after the masks were gone! It's nice to have an easy dress up trunk for little boys. I would recommend these to play in for any little super hero!
2,mask were cracked,"I ordered 3 boxes each box had at least one mask cracked, the costumes were Ok the boys were able to use their imagination"
4,Fun but cheap,"My 4 year old loved getting these costumes for Christmas. They are very easy to get on and he has been having a great time playing with them. However they are cheaply made and the grappling hook is a bad idea, and was broken within the first hour of use. Not sure if it is because the toy is cheaply made or because my son thought it was real and tried to climb the walls with it and it for sure isn't strong enough to hold any weight. But I am sure any child will try to climb with it."
5,I DIDN'T KNOW AN ALBUM COULD BE SO GOOD!,"In case you have already read my review of Cheb Mami's later album ""Meli, Meli"", you would know that I was completely impressed with the music on that CD. However, his cd ""Saida"" is even better! For anyone new to the musical genre of Rai, either one of these albums makes a wonderful introduction, but the beauty of the melodies on ""Saida"" is priceless. Cheb Mami's musical range, both vocally and in his diverse styles, is amazing to observe and he deserves to be better recognized in the musical world. I believe that we will eventually see/hear more from him.I recommend this album with the highest praise. For years I have been a hardcore fan of Spanish, Greek and Turkish music, so adding a new style to my collection was a treat. Cheb Mami is a musical wonder to my ears."
4,Cry of the Desert,"Cheb Mami's ""Desert Rose"" brought the Algerian superstar to worldwide fame. On his own, Cheb Mami is an electrifying singer. ""Saida"",from 1995, shows him in fine form. ""Saida"" shows Mami's range of emotions--from the passionate opening ""H'babi"" to his lament ""Trab.""""Saida"" is the cry of the desert. Cheb Mami's fluid,powerful voice reflects the merciless desert sun shining upon the endlessly shifting dunes. ""H'babi"" is an amazing cry of unrequited love. The follow-up,""Ma ma"" is a less successful rap. Mami's singing is wonderful,but his duet partner does a lame rap in English. ""Hay wadi hay galbi"" shows off Mami's vocal skills. His voice leaps,ululates,as athletic as a gymnast. ""Baida"" sounds like it is from the Renaissance,another lovelorn song. A simple lute accompanies Mami. ""Ghi N'ti"" has a synthesized '80s sound. The closing song,""Trab"",is a powerful,earthy lament.""Saida"" shows Mami at the beginning of his career,beginning to blossom. It's a desert rose."
1,Crappy crossover rai,"If you like your rai over-produced and overtly western-sounding, this is for you. Otherwise avoid at all costs. Stick with the classic pop-rai from before Khaled's self-titled album on Cohiba/PolyGram, and anything produced by the late rai production genius, Rachid Baba"
4,Excellent for beginning counselors,"David Martin's book is an excellent beginners guide to understanding how to talk with patients. The book is a easy read, written for the common everday person. He goes through various types of communication with the client in order to develop the therapeutic relationship. If your uncomfortable sitting in the therapists seat try this book."
5,great for beginners!,This book is great for beginners and makes you feel safe about starting to see clients. When I am reading I feel as though my professor is talking to me and does not put me to sleep. It gives great advice.
3,More for Psychology Majors,This book is a hard read unless you know what the author is talking about. Not for beginners; more for intermediate.
3,a mix ?,"Checking the list on ""Shake sugaree"" and ""Shakin' a Tailfeather"" - i got both and with great pleasure -, it seems that this one got ten titles from these two. Question : are they the same recordings, leaving only five new ones ? Or is it a brand new one ?I bet on the first, so i'm hesitating. Could you help ?"
5,Masterful Technique,"Wally Jay truly does make it all look easy! I learned new things from the very start that add power in techniques. I am an intermediate student (5th Kyu) in the Budoshin style of Ju-jitsu. My only complaint is that the techniques are demonstrated rather quickly and completely without much hesitation most times. One of the great advantages of the 8 DVD series, from white belt to shodan, put out by George Kirby, 10th dan is the slow motion photographic that allows careful examination of the techniques presented. From a purely aesthetic view, the conclusion sequence where Wally puts all the techniques together shows Ju-jitsu as an awesome ballet of control where with minimal effort you can take an attacker wherever you want to go. Truly inspiring!"
2,Fishman Bluegrass Series Rare Earth Banjo Pickup,"I'm really sorry to say that it was very disappointing. Believe it or not, very difficult to install. I imagine if you have a $5,000.00 Gibson Mastertone, you might have better results. I, on the other hand, didn't and had to relocate the banjo's top rimrod and modify the pickup mounting bracket just to get it to clear the banjo's head. The sound was adequate."
5,Been Back to this One Many Times,"I have owned this as an LP, a casette, and now as a CD. Problem is, every time I play it for someone who has never heard of Townes, they are so blown away by the very first hearing that I become absorbed into their enthusiasm and I end up giving them the LP, or casette, or CD. What I want them to do is spread the word. Like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Leonard Cohen, Townes was probably warned early on not to persue a singing career. In fact, his voice is beautiful, with a quality of melancholy. It is warm (""brooding,"" as someone has said). The acoustic guitar is perfectly played, with outstanding finger picking. And of course, Townes was an extraordinary lyricist. Every song on this album is great. It is so sad that he never had a wider audience, but then, how often does something this good acheive such an audience? You can't go wrong with this work."
5,B-movies can be fun,"Skippy's revenge is a good stand alone game, but better when combined with Grave Robbers from Outer Space. With some interesting locations and weapons, you can get some hilarious combinations. Can your bad movie hold out until somebody rolls the credits? or will you be decimated by the redneck pump jockey in the final reel? If the special effects don't get you the undead pets might. Even losing this game is funny. And remember, zombie attacks always succeed at the mall so good luck with that."
3,CIELO ROJO-RED SKY OVERLY DRAMATIC & ENTERTAINING,"Cielo RojoRED SKY A RAW DRAMA FROM THE '60s about two lovers Rodolfo & Maria (Mr. RODOLFO DE ANDA R.I.P 2010 & Ms. PATRICIA CONDE HUSBAND & WIFE IN REAL LIFE) FILMED IN MEXICO'S BEAUTIFUL ACAPULCO. Rodolfo is a CLIFF DIVER AT THE FAMOUS TOURISTIC LA QUEBRADA, a dangerous occupation that barely pays him to survive so he becomes an opportunistic young man who stops at nothing for money. To add to his troubled life his girlfriend Maria, also a poor girl from the port area, gives Rodolfo the unespected news that she is pregnant with his child. What evolves from this point is a story about moral responsibility & choices for these two young people whose lives are forced to the brink of murder. Again, excellent acting by Mr. DE ANDA & THE VERY TALENTED Ms. CONDE. She retired early from her acting career while still a young woman. CIELO ROJO - RED SKY - THE COLOR OF BLOOD!!"
5,Impressive visual effect & easy to perform,"This is one of the perfect magic effects for magicians at any level, particularly young beginning magicians.Producing the main effect is simple with little preparation needed. It is very visual effect and can be shown from virtually all angles except below. Alone, it's a fast trick, but it can also be incorporated into a routine with some slight of hand. It takes less than a minute to reset the trick. It's built to last for years, but it can be easy for kids to lose the small dice.I bought it for less than $7, which was a great deal for one of the best effects in the Fantasma collection."
5,Monique combines class and soul beyond her age.,Resolution is one of the best R&B CD's I've heard in a long time. How refreshing to hear someone who has an ethereal quality while maintaining classic soul and emotion in their voice without all of the vocal acrobats so popular in R&B music. It should also be noted that the production work is flawless along with having lyrics that have depth.
5,Still Wonderful,I had the pleasure of seeing the Bird Sisters several times when I lived in Guelph 1990-96. I have listend to their CD's hundreds of times over the years and they are still one of my favoutite groups. If you can find a CD - get it. You won't be disappointed.
5,The Odalisque,"I enjoy reading books about harem life and found Richard Manton's afterward of fact versus fiction most intiquiging. What an added bonus/encore! The wildest fiction 'is' tame compared with the history of real-life harem spectaculars, and his fictional 'Odalisque' encapsualtes it with dynamite plot twists and characterizations that are far from dry. As allways, the erotica is five alarm jalapinio sprinkled with just enough authentic salt. How I would love to have him write one for us."
2,what is all the rage about this book???,"I ordered this book because of the stellar reviews here on amazon. I was totally disappointed. The [adult scenes] was done with no feeling whatsoever, it was told very clinically, with no description. What about the tastes, feels, smells, sounds? There is more to [adult scenes] than he put this there and she submitted. Blah!The entire first half of the book is boring history/war type stuff. The maid that is described as her having a thing with is mentioned in one sentence and then never again and not once does she have a ""thing"" with her! Perhaps it is a good account of harem life. But that is all it is. An account. It is not descriptive, enticing, or even entertaining. It is written like something from a textbook. Yawn! If you want to know how it feels, do not bother with this book...im not even sure why I gave this two stars."
2,Another phoned in book,"It was rather predictable and there was no coherant plot line, just a way to move from sex scene to sex scene."
2,Dry,"Ho hum. Someone else mentioned the several chapters that found the story - good to have, but in this case not written in a manner to catch and keep your interest. When I first read the reviews, I heard it was authentic in its discussion of harem life - after reading it, I imagine that may be factually true, but the spirit was certainly lacking.For something that pretends to be authentic, there were at least three scenes off the top of my head (such as the Egyptian man being raped for impudence in staring at Jenny's lush hind-quarters) that wrote any authenticity to the wind.Frankly, I bought it for story because the reviews promised one, gave up on the story to evaluate it on ""good"" sex scenes since the story was flat, and finally put the book down disappointed on all accounts."
2,Incredibly Boring,"i had such high hopes for this book. my disappointment set in after reading the first 2 pages. this is supposed to be erotica? there's more pages/chapters devoted to describing boring, dry historical/war scenes than anything else. i found myself flipping through all the historical backdrops and just reading the ""supposed"" erotic scenes. and jenny got on my last nerve...were we supposed to feel sorry for her? and personally, i dont think there's anything erotic about female circumcision and bloody whippings."
1,Awful,To call this book erotic should lead the reviewer to be charged with fraud. The story line has more history than sex. The first 132 pages has nothing erotic and the remaing 70 pages actually provide a partial reason as to why Blue Moon is publishing it.
1,Very very very bad,"This book doesn't even really count as a novel. The protagonist is an afterthought, and the plot is erotic only if you get off on female circumcision and rape. There's an annotated bibliography of white slavery for an appendix, so maybe the author is really more interested in the literature than in getting the reader excited. Anyhow, the blurb is a complete lie. There's no maid, there's no lush introduction to the sensual ways of love, and there's no sympathy with the supposed heroine. Pretty brutal stuff, and not worth your time."
2,NOT FOR EVERYONE,"I think that it is easy to get kids interested in anything that sounds like it comes from the radio. That is the key with this. There isn't any trick to the learning, just singing the facts adapted to rap songs by artists such as 50 Cent, Tupac, and Ludacris.I found the video a little troubling. The pieces with the girls wearing half shirts and exposing the strings to their panties I think is a little over the top for an educational video. Kind of a shame."
2,Inappropriate images,Initially I enjoyed the 1 times tables rap but after seeing gangster images and young girls showing their g-strings I have to send this back. The DVD is poor quality and kept skipping. My six year old could not understand the words although he liked the beats. Great idea but wrong format.
1,Hip Hop Cd,"This is obviously a Cd which was previously burned. The Cd is not clear and after only having played it twice for my class, the Cd now skips without showing any signs of physical damage. Would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Terrible DVD,"This was not a good DVD for learning at all. My son and I could not understand what was being said at all. I enjoy rap as much as the next person, but a learning DVD should be easy to understand."
3,Disapointment,A complicated and I think very insecure individual. I was hoping for more psychological insight into his personality but for me this book didn't quite satisfy.
1,NO FLEECE BLANKET,"This was described as a nice sleep system to put over your airbed, with sheet material inside, a fleece blanket inside, and then a comforter on top that all zips together. Just what I needed for my truck camper RV, I thought!Well, it is a very (VERY) lightweight queensize sleeping bag, no fleece blanket in sight. My husband and I tried it in our 54 degree bedroom and were cold. I would say it's for a nice spring night indoors, and would be great as extra bedding used like that. But you would have to wash the whole sleeping bag after guests leave.It does fit well on the top of a queen size bed, and my husband, who is 6'4"" did fit in the sleeping bag easily, which is great.I just want my fleece blanket, then it would work great for us. I could throw a big down comforter over the whole works when it is cold.This is made by the same company that makes swiss army knives. The zippers appear well made."
3,Why didn't I read these first?,"Then I wouldn't have been so confused that there was no fleece blanket!! Anyway, is okay for the price, would have liked the removable fleece and for it to be a bit softer but I haven't washed it yet, so maybe that will make the difference."
4,"Great Overall, But where's the fleece blanket?",My husband purchased this item for me last year for Christmas. Have used it 4 times for camping and used it a few times for the kids to sleep in when we stay at a hotel. They loved it and the fact that we can still unzip it and use it as two seperate bag's is great....But like everyone else says...>WHERES MY FLEECE BLANKET?
3,Restful nights,"This is a great light weight sleeping bag for two. It is not bulky and stuffs fairly easily into a carry bag provided. This bag is not for cooler/colder months. It has dual zippers for easy access to each side and they are of good quality. The only thing I don't like about it is one side is nylon and slides all over the place on the bed. They do provide these large elastics to secure it to the bed, but it's a pain. They should change the nylon to cloth so it will stay in place better. A good purchase for the money."
2,Buyer Be Aware,"If you are considering purchasing this CD, please be aware that this is a live recording; if you do not appreciate audience participation (i.e., clapping and bravo-ing at the end of a performance)when listening to recorded classical music, then this is not the album for you. Also, Maestro Previn's conducting of Ravel's ""La Valse"" is lethargic, heavy-handed, and greatly disappointing."
1,Obsessive Compulsive,"(1.) Talk about an obsessive compulsive whatever you would think that dysfunctional romances with the same stereotypic city apartment triangle/quadrangle relationships would just wear the threads thin eventually unless, of course, there's money to be made in retreading to the same emotionally unstable chick flick demographic audience.(2.) Forgettable movie and acting that after only a week I've forgotten what it's purpose was or who was in it."
3,I'VE COLLECTED EVERY WOODY FILM. THIS ONE'S TOO GREEN TO BURN,"It's just not the muddled concept, the unanswered plot points, the drab dialogue, butthat prior films were so much more alive. Three stars reflect what was delivered in Allen's prior brilliant films. ( sigh )"
3,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"There are two themes that permeate Woody Allen's latest film, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger: the age-old idea that the grass is always greener on the other side and Shakespeare's quote about a tale of ""sound and fury signifying nothing."" While neither is new to the realm of Woody Allen and his body of work, the fleeting moments of quality in Stranger are overshadowed by the failure to venture into any new territory for the aged director.Read the rest of my review here:[...]"
1,POOF! -- A FLAT SOUFFLE,"What was Woody thinking? Here's a great looking movie with an excellent cast that has been miraculously constructed around nothing. That's right, it's like cotton candy that dissolves in the warm carnival air or a soufflé that deflates when you try and taste it. Not much else to say other than the real subject of interest here is just how Woody Allen manages to get his endless stream of mostly disappointing movies produced and released. See it if you must, but don't blame me."
1,Disappointing Woody Allen,"I usually enjoy Woody Allen's films, but this one is not only very depressing, but out of the 4 interwoven stories, only one is resolved. The other three are left hanging so there is no ending to this film. A major disappointment."
2,Sad and Open Ended,"If you're looking for another Midnight in Paris, don't look here. Although billed as a comedy I would say this is more of a drama somewhat akin to the very serious movies Allan produced in the 1980s. It features a elderly housewife whose husband leaves her for a younger woman (a prostitute in fact) unable to cope with her divorce and her dysfunctional family. Allan does not bother to try to tie up loose ends as the film concludes leaving you scratching your head and asking what the point really was. To go into too much detail would provide too many spoilers, and even a stellar cast can't rescue this melancholy offering. If you like Allan's more dramatic and sad titles, you would probably like this--I was looking for a light movie to watch with my friends on New Years Eve and this doesn't suit the bill."
3,DVD from Amazon Vendor,"The DVD arrived in a short time and I was able to send it on to my friend for her birthday. My only complaint was that the cover looked a little ""beaten up,"" scuffed and with a dent that made me wonder if the disc was o.k. Apparently it was."
2,Just One of Thousands,As just one of thousands who met Mr.Buckley (five times) and got to talk with him it is a pleasure to have the DVD memorial to him. It is an overview of parts of his amazingly varied life that one hour was fine to see and due to the time of one hour was about two hours short of the three hours needed for even a slight in-depth listing of the man's accomplishments in a uniquely American life. One sniveling hour would not cover Firing Line excerpts alone! John C (Jerry) Lemon MD
4,Very Pleasant B.J. Thomas,"From the CD label I gather that these are not the historic hits of B.J. Thomas, but newly recorded songs. He certainly sounds to me as good as he has ever been in these recordings. Maybe he has mellowed a bit with age, but that just makes for more pleasant listening. This would be great to put in a CD shuffle along with Percy Faith, Billy Vaughn and Bert Kaemphert. I graded it down one star for those 'purists' who only want the original recordings; otherwise, it is a five star CD to me."
3,Chuck for small Ryobi drill press,The chuck is constructed decent. The key is cheap and has a spring loaded detent on the end that pushes it out of the chuck that I do not care for. It's the same as the factory chuck and the only replacement I could find.
1,BUYER BEWARE,This album does not include actual performances by the Grass Roots. It is covers by some random band. Really bad covers.
1,NOT the original hits,"Once again Madacy has ripped you off by not giving a disclaimer that these are NOT the original artist's recordings, but some re-recordings by possibly one original member. Get the *original* hit versions for a few bucks more. These suck"
1,Not Original Music,Do not buy this.The songs are not original.I should have looked at the review before I ordered it.Now I know why it was so cheap.
2,Not original version,"I wish I had took the time to listen to the samples of the album. Because I saw the picture of them when they were younger, I assumed it would be the older original versions of the songs, the version you would hear on the radio. Well, they are not. That was extremely disappointing. I will now delete these and buy a version that has the originals."
2,Golden Legends; The Grass Roots,"[Amazon Verified Purchase] First off this complaint has nothen to do with Amazon.com.This product is nowhere close to the original recording.I will not purchase anymore Golden Legends products.It says [New stereo recordings by the original artist]. I have The Golden Grass Greatest hits album, It is in stereo too.It is a much better product, this is one album that was not available on cd,they are far and few.Amazon.com delivers.This recording sounds like half of the band did not show-up."
2,Squirrel's not interested,The bait didn't really attract the squirrels. I find my pellet gun is the only answer at this time. I intend on adding some peanut butter to the bait to see if that will do a better job.
3,Not what I thought,"I thought this video would be alittle more instructional. It seemed mostly comprised of one guy repeatedly subduing a couple other younger guys with no direction how to reenact this in normal sparring. If given the option, I would try another DVD."
4,Warning No Sound.,"I would advise people to stay away from this DVD Unless they really know their subject well, The quality of this DVD is okay just good enough for viewing only. Small Circle Jujitsu Intermediate has no instructional sound value what so ever. There is no sound to explain what Professor Wally Jay is demonstrating to us. Some things I could figure out, but the majority of what he showing is left up to the person viewing his DVD to figure out on there own. I still really love this DVD. Professor Wally Jays is awesome. I just like to watch it from time to time. Just be ware this DVD has no sound, or at least the one I purchased didn't. I'm disappointed about the sound, but glad to be watching a cool person show us his craft one of the greats do his thang."
4,Epic but,"Wally Jay was held up by Bruce Lee as one of the best in his craft, JuJitsu. The film is very simple and cheap even in its presentation, no fancy camera work or props here. All is done in a gym with some willing victims. The technique is clear though too often too fast to really catch clearly. Some slo-mo work would have been nice."
1,HORRIBLE Product,"I bought this military watch w/ a 3 strap gift set for my husband. And he LOVED it!! The delivery was very fast(considering it was shipped all the way from NY)& the condition of the package was good. Customer service was great, they responded right away. i'll be buying from them again & will recommend others.---------2 weeks later---------My husband was very upset! Not only did this watch cost us over $30 but he only wore it maybe 12 times before the watch just STOPPED working, and when we contacted customer service they were very rude and unhelpful!!Very disappointed about the product itself so buyers BEWARE, cheaply made, look for a different watch!! (if I could rate this product lower then 1 star I would.)"
1,Terrible Watch,"I recommend that nobody purchases this watch. Mine broke after a month, I sent it back to Smith & Wesson and they sent me a completely different watch about 12 weeks later. I sent that back and they eventually sent me the correct replacement after another 8 weeks. That watch broke within a week. Very cheap materials. Please don't buy this- it is junk."
1,Headache! It's a great piece of Garbage! don't buy!!,"Thinking you will receive a great watch for a good price!!!? NONONONO! it is just a piece of garbage!!!!!!!; has stooped in few hours; on reality it is a chinese branded watch. Smith & Wesson don't fabricate watches. I am a international buyer and now, i am suffering because i've lost my money! in the end, the cheap becamed very expensive!!!"
1,Way too Clunky,"I ordered this watch thinking it would be the appropriate size, but it is quite large (2"" from one end of the face to the other) and it engulfed my wrist - I do have small wrists, but still it was BIG."
1,Horrible,All 3 straps broke with in hours of wearing them would not buy this...very cheap! Complete waste of money..was not happy
1,"nice, but not quite","this product is nice, it's exactly what you get in the picture. I bought this watch for my boyfriend, and he was very happy with it. He loved the changeable straps, and the way it felt and looked. After 2 weeks of use, the plastic dial that changes the time broke off, but that did not bug him. he still enjoyed it and would switch time (daylight saving) with my tweezers. after a week he showered with it, and it announces that is water resistant, but the next day there was moisture and sweat inside the watch and it did not work. 2 days after it started working. But today, he was wearing the watch and the needle that reads the seconds broke off and its stuck on the glass, still due to the water damage. It's a very nice watch but too good to be true, smith&wesson makes guns, and not watches. Please continue to make good guns and not cheap watches, im very unsatisfied."
2,Very Good Watch!,"I originally had a very good review on this watch. Recent events have changed my opinion. At first glance this watch appears to be very well made. The sad truth is that if you're living in a warm weather state, after a rainy day, the humidity will cause water to buildup inside and behind the crystal. That being said, the watch can't possibly be water resistant up to 99 feet. I have no doubt that if I jump into a pool of 5 feet, this watch will be filled up with water. Now, if the watch runs by H20, that's a different story. Smith & Wesson should stick to making boots. I love their leather tacitcal boots, but I hate their watches."
3,Doesn't fit my wrist,"I am 6'5"" 240lbs. This doesn't fit around my wrist. I got it for backpacking, so I will probably just wear it around my pack's shoulder straps. The reason I purchased it was because I thought it would be high quality coming from S&W. It seems a tad cheap, but only time will tell."
2,Pass This One Up,"I really did like this watch at first. The strap took some time to wear in but it looked great and performed just as you'd expect it to. I even got a few compliments on it. After a few weeks this ""water resistant"" watch was getting water inside the face from showering, and worst of all the band started to stink from getting wet. It was a very stale, pungent odor that made my wrist stink as well. I wanted to like this watch, and I was hoping it would keep up for the long haul, but unfortunately it lasted but a few months and is nothing more than a piece of junk. I suggest looking for something else."
4,smith n wesson watch,Good watch for basic useNicely madeHad one in army never let me down onceI recommend this watch to law enforcement and related industries
5,Great watch Straps..........,"I love the size-thin, and not to big aroung in Diameter. THe Straps however, were a little to short -I wet them and was able to stretch them about 1 & 1/2 "" for non reflection good! but of course the crystal is very reflective, I may get a new band w/ cover over watch face-ALl in all Its great watch and for 20 bucks what can I say? .OH-My .44 Mag did not stop this watch . .....From.....Shootrr45"
1,Broke within hOurs,The time dusk snapped off minutes after receipt. I was so disgusted I just threw the piece of crap out.
1,Very Disappointed,"Smith and Wesson?? I expected more from them. I got this from my son which was on his wish list but imagine his disappoint when he put it on and it litterly fell apart, from the stem to the strap. Buyer beware"
2,Poor quality,"I opened the box, took off the plastic guard around the winding pin, and the whole thing fell out, making it impossible to set the time....ok, so I opened up the back and the second hand fell off! But, w/o the second hand, I was able to manually advance the hands to the correct date and time, put the case and cover back on and wear it. It's very quiet. Of course, unless you actually see the minute hand advance, it's hard to tell if it's working. The canvas straps are nice and thick, need a little breaking in, but assuming none of the other parts fall off tonight, it seems to work ok for $20"
2,Disappointed with watchband,Had to replace watch band. Too smallJust an inexpensive watch and I don't have high expectations. We'll see how long it lasts.
4,good,"The Smith & Wesson Men's SWW-1464-BLK is a very good watch for the working outdoors-man ,the extra straps makes sur eu are always in style ,very sturdy built.The straps could be a tad longer but otherwise its great"
5,time will tell,"just got it here in South Korea. It looks solid, feels solid and as far as I can see, it displays the correct time. I'm going to wrap it and give it to my son to give to me for Christmas. Japanese Movement sounds good to me too."
5,QUALITY BARGAIN,"Needed an inexpensive and basic watch that provided quality. The Smith & Wesson has this great reputation for fine hand guns, so I felt that they wouldn't put their name on junk; they didn't. I found it to be reliable and accurate. It has a date, and second hand....what else do you need. The bonus is the crystal is made of glass. At this price, you can't go wrong."
2,Doesn't hold up,"After having had this watch for over a year, it does not seem to be holding up well. The black plating has been coming off, which gives it a worn look which may be good or bad. What it mostly bothering me though is that the inside of the glass has developed this foggy film which gives it a pretty cheap look. I will be replacing this watch soon."
2,You get what you pay for.,"After having this watch in less than 1.5 feet of water for no more than 15 minutes, the inside of the watch is filled with condensation.The bands are super cheap. I should have sprung the extra 15 or 20 bucks and got a Timex.This thing is garbage!"
1,I never got my item,"Do not order at this site...I order that grill 2 monts ago, they send my one metal stick not the grill after 3 weeks.... after i spend some time on the phone, i send it back,after 3 days .... i receive the same thing....I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS GUY...I TAKE SOME TIME TO RIGHT THIS FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE"
4,was gonna give five stars,"But the 5th star says ""i love it"" and i try not to waste my love on nonliving things. So 5 stars The simpsons is the best cartoon ever and I love all the people who have helped make it so great."
4,The Simpsons: The Fourteenth Season (Blu-ray),I purchased this Simpsons 14th season for my son. He loves the Simpsons and has all the dvds. I would recommend this to everyone. Amazon made this purchase very convenient and price was good.
5,Christmas present,The person I bought this for enjoys this series even though I never watch it.Need five more words. lol
3,Collectors Edition????,"While the this is not the ""Glory Days"" of the Simpsons era it still has plenty of solid epiodes and memorable sceens. If you are a Simpsons fan you'll be adding it to your collection.Have they gone away from the Special Collectors Edition Boxes though. I have got the whole set of them so far and it was one of the main insentives to pre-ordering the box set. Plenty of great classic characters left to choose from for them too."
3,Meh down to the disks,"This season is incredibly bland right down to the disk art which is probably the reason they decided to put kang on the cover. There are tons of memorable characters to choose from that are regulars but putting kang on there pretty much is a marketing tactic. I don't really study the art on the disks but i seems familiar to the last couple of seasons; just the number of the disk and a simpson. If you put these in a dvd binder you'll have no clue what season they're from unless you add an identifier.I still like the simpsons but this season just is too marge centric, too many guest stars, and incredibly un-funny. How do you make weird al unfunny? Poor writing. You might actually fall asleep watching a lot of these episodes (I have). I guess this was where the show completely jumped the shark. Frank Grimes Jr? Come on."
4,the beginning of the fall,I love every season of the simpsons its my favorite show of all time but seasons 14-19 are easily the worse in the series but I still love them seasons 14-19 are stil better than anything else on tv but they are not as good as seasons 1-13 and 20-present but this is still a excellent buy just make sure you get on blu ray if you dont you get the worst packaging EVER! as comic book guy would say it this has the same cardboard packaging that season 11 had but if you get it on blu ray you get much better packaging the packaging is like a playstation 3 games packaging overall it still makes me laugh so hard I poop my pants but the old seasons made me laugh much harder and this has amazing extras and has commentary on every episode
5,love the simpsons,i love the simpsons and the fourteen season dosent let me down i would highly recommend to all the simpsons fan out there
3,Its great but it could have been betrer...,i grew up on the simpsons and i got to say i still watch them today but sometimes i wish they would get a bit more continuity in the show or some funnier jokes so they could keep up with the times.
4,Not too shabby...,"Considering that I'm a die hard fan of ""The Simpsons"" and that I've seen nearly every episode of this season recently, I felt like I was fit to review this season. While there aren't any episodes that could be considered classics like ""Itchy and Scratchy Land"", I still feel like this is a very watchable and funny season. Truth be told, I hadn't seen many of these episodes since they originally aired almost 10 years ago, and while I too was a little skeptical at first, I was pleasantly surprised that this season gave us some pretty funny episodes. Some episodes may be a little bland, but if you're a true Simpsons fan, I don't know why you wouldn't like this set.Favorite Season 14 Quote: ""If I can stroke out just one freak on stilts, I know I've done my job."" - Chief Wiggum"
3,Skips,I haven't made it through all of the disc's but the second one is skipping and I am unable to watch every episode. Was hoping that it would have been in better condition.
3,Good But Dated Incomplete Book,"After reading the book I felt it was very dated and left out elements I wanted to know more about. It's a comprehensive book for it's time and you learn a lot but being dated it left out a lot. For example, it did not go into reviews or cover more recent coffee roasters or techniques. They reviewed roasters that are no longer available and not roasters that are now available like the Behmor. Also, I'm mostly interested in drum roasting using my barbeque and Ronco Rotisserie. He never mentioned these techniques. There are places that sell drums to fit into your rotisserie and barbeques that he never mentioned. IE Coffeeroastersclub.com I think you can learn more on the net than what this book has to offer."
4,Great book for home coffee roasters.,"This book is very good and will get you started on the road to home coffee roasting, be sure to check out sweet maria's website for the best advice and latest info on coffee information."
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping for a helpful, technical explanation of coffee roasting. I don't feel as if this is it.... ""romance & revival"" is a good description. just not the book for me."
4,A lot of info at a small price,"Over 240 pages of coffee roasting related information.Home, and comercial roasting as well as beans, approached as the roast object.A good roasting guide and reference source."
3,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"After reading the reviews, I purchased this book. I found no useful information. I was looking for a detailed analysis about how to go about tinkering with the roasting profile. What I got was a superficial overview and survey of coffee. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a really good book written about roasting, or at least I have not found it."
2,Recycled!,"Her first book was full of information and basics for weight loss and this is just a longer, recycled version of that book. Her first was much more to the point about how to become healthy, and this one goes on for ever about why all the other diets don't work. If you have her first, don't bother getting this one."
2,The Diet Trap is a Diet Trap,"While this book readily critizes many other diets as ""diet traps"", this book is itself a diet trap.This book does give many pieces of good, although mostly common-sensical, advice on how to live a healthy life. But, it ironically concludes with a seven-week DIET program despite spending several chapters criticizing diets in general.I lost a good 5 pounds with this diet in its first few weeks, but readily gained it back in the last few weeks of the program.I recommend this book as giving good pieces of advice on how to live healthily, but do not purchase this book with the hopes of losing a significant amount of weight."
2,Diet bashing at its best,"This book boils down to Pam's same recommendations as in Food for Life and Eat Well, Live Well, both excellent books. But in this new book she resorts to bashing all other diets out there, with a definite edge to her ""voice"", only to sum up the recommended way of eating to be yet another ""diet"" which she calls ""The Smart Weigh"". She never called her plan that in the other books, yet she acts as if it was called that all along. It is frustrating when an author keeps repackaging the same material to make more money. It's even sadder when a Christian author puts down others in the repackaging in order to do it. I was disappointed by this book."
5,Survivor of sexual abuse comments on Fish in a Barrel,"Grace Tower tells her remarkable story in startling detail appropriate to the crimes against her and her family. She writes with exceptional clarity and courage. As I read every single page, I was again reminded of the extent to which victims of sexual abuse are harmed, the obstacles one must confront even after breaking the silence, and the fortitude I admire in those who do what Grace has done. I highly recommend Fish in a Barrel and have loaned my personal copy to several victims.Belinda Martinez"
3,Okay book,"This was a run of the mill Norah Roberts. I mostly enjoy her books, this was not at the top of my list. I pretty much knew from the beginning what would happen and who the bad guy was. Good if you are looking to just pass some time."
2,Read closely,"Always a good read from Nora Roberts. However, look closely because this is a republication and just renamed from Montana Sky. I wish I had read the reviews first because I didn't recognize it at first.Still having said that, I couldn't stop reading it."
3,Boundary Lines,"I enjoyed this book, however is wasn't the great novel, but a good easy read. It wasmore at the adult level than some of Ms. Roberts books."
3,Pretty inoffensive but lacking any real inspiration,Pretty much a run of the mill romance anyone could have penned it. Not a Nora great read like I have come to expect.
2,BLAH,"Predictable from the very first chapter. Young beautiful people, welll educated and ""vistims"" of a family feud have mind blowing sex and feud is over."
5,The Witness,Absolutely classic as only Nora can write! I have honestly read all of her books and eagerly wait for the coming releases
2,boundary lines,Could not get into story it was missing something seemed like she was copying one of her other books. Not even close to her best work.
2,Boundary Lines,"This is the least favorite of my Nora Roberts. If you like sexual scenes, this is good, but I also loved her character development, which this did not have. I was going to into the series but I think that I would better off skipping this series. Thanks but no thanks"
2,Nora Roberts Boundary Lines,"I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan and usually read everything she's written. When ordering an e-book, details like the year the novel was written aren't available. I believe this is one of her earlier works. As a result, it's a little lack lustre.A few more details in the description would have been helpful prior to making the decision to purchase."
1,Not one of her best,This is not one of Nora's bes. The characters are more superficial and the plot seems a bit weak compared to her ususal ficition.
2,Predictable,Not near as good as other books done by her . Felt like she threw it together to get it done quickly and out in marketplace.
5,Theatre wardrobe storage,"These racks are perfect for all of the heavy coats and tons of pants, dresses and shirts our community theatre has accumulated! We purchased racks at WalMart and Target, but they were not nearly as sturdy as these hanging racks! Don't waste your money on mediocre racks that fall apart after you hang way more stuff than the cheap racks can hold! These racks got rid of our frustration and keep the stuff hanging up instead of on the floor!"
1,Cheap Zippers,"I zipped it up and the zipper pull came right off. Some zippers are metal and you can get the pull back on. Even plastic zippers are sometimes fixable. These zippers are a spiraling nylon that just unravels if it gets loose or undone at any point. I'm disappointed because otherwise it's a sturdy bag. There is another zipper on the other side which I had never used and the zipper pull is missing, so the bag is unusable; garbage."
2,be warned,"Two things: 1) this bag can only be used if the rod in your closet has a diameter less than 1.5 inches, preferably much less than that (this is not indicated anywhere in the product info, so I could not use it until I made my own rod); 2) the bag has no internal frame (as the product description correctly indicates), so be aware that the picture is somehow misleading: when you hung the bag it does not hold well, and it is difficult to put clothes inside, particularly because the material is hard and heavy. It is of course honest to indicate ""frameless"" in the product info, but I don't think this should be heralded as a good thing, quite the opposite."
4,does job,"This product is perfect for dresses you don't use often. For me this means it's in the extra bedroom closet. The frameless part is a bit odd but I know it won't break, and the plastic is extra heavy duty."
5,Jumbo Dress garment bag,"I was very surprised at what a really great product this was for the price, it fit my needs perfectly. it has heavy duty zipper and plenty of room for several large garments.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good deal on a sturdy garment bag for storage"
3,Inexpensive but quality reflects that,"Heeding the warnings of other reviewers, I handled this carefully, but it still pulled apart a bit at one of the seams. Fortunately, my careful handling meant only a small separation, which I taped up with partial success. Otherwise, it's a good product, heavy material, fits the rod with no problem. It's not quite deep enough (front to back) for the clothes, but it's not serious and this seems to be a standard width."
4,"Great product, despite a minor flaw","I decided to purchase this product after reading reviews that said to watch out about the diameter of your closet rod. I thought mine was narrow enough. Although the white, flexible circular doodads fit fine but snug, the clear plastic ones that were built into the bag were brittle and cracked and broke at the first sign of stress from trying to get them around the rod. Nevertheless, I LOVE this bag, and it didn't seem to matter that the side circular doodads were cracked/broken. You don't really need them. It is a GREAT bag. I would would give it a 5 star except for this minor design flaw. I love the way it fits totally around your clothes already hanging on your closet rod, thereby saving inches in height so your clothes aren't dragging on the floor (even if they ARE in a bag). And the velcro seam is brilliant."
2,"flimsy - only one in package despite ""set of 2"" in ad","Bag is pretty cheap plastic. Plastic was already ripped around the edge of the circular pieces that hang on the rod. Ad said ""set of 2"" and I only got one bag. Someone else mentioned this, but I figured it was just an isolated mistake. Not a good value for one bag."
2,Arrived torn,"The company was wonderful in processing a refund, but the bag was definitely not of good quality. If you really want to protect your clothing, look at another product."
4,basement storage,"I needed a way to keep clothes hanging in the basement covered/protected, and this works great. easy to install on the pole, easy to get into when I need to pull something out."
2,corvette 66-82,basic manual not that in depth compared to gm shop manual but look at the pric diffrence
1,Disapointed,"You will note that a lot of 4 & 5 star reviews are correct but prove my point for example. They compare this product against other inferior products and say it is better and it is of all the general manuals this is one of the better. Comparing this to the manuals in a parts stores or other general information book does give you the feeling that you have a better book. If you compare this to the Manufactures Manual for the year you own and you are kind in your review you would give it 2 or 3 stars.I'm was not kind it got 1 star but being the best of the inferior books it could have gotten a 2 star review.If you own a C3 Corvette (shark body style (Stingray)) recommend get the correct tools connect with others on an online forum and have fun. I love my 82 Corvette Collector Edition. It is a money pit but as the kids at Jack in the Box asking me ""How do you like your Bat Mobile"" and saying ""That is so cool of a car""."
2,Don't judge a book by it's title,I needed a Shop Manual specifically for an '81 Vette...this manual though claiming to represent 66-82 has a tiny supplement at the end for 80-82 Vettes and doesn't have a wiring diagram for an '81 or info on the Electronic carburetor from that year...and no body or interior info after '79.Misleading...I will need to track down an original Shop manual.
5,What I Expected,"I prefer large print books, so I ordered the large print edition of my favorite version. It came in volumes in an attractive slipcase and is just what I expected it to be."
3,Does not respond to e-mail.,"I ordered these 2 books for my grandmother who is 90 years old because her large print Bible is too heavy. The New Testament version is great but the Old Testament version is just as BIG as her old Bible. I do not reccommend the Old Testament version, and I have e-mailed the seller asking if I can return it and have had no response in 2 weeks."
1,DO NOT BUY ARBORIA PRODUCTS!,"I made the mistake of buying the side table, along with the coffee table, the Contentment Sofa and Contentment Armchair. I was pretty happy with my purchase until after the first time it rained. The rain washed most of the wood stain right off the furniture onto my patio, and left numerous brown stains all over my patio tile. The stains are permanent and have ruined my tile and patio. And now the furniture is much lighter and looks washed out. I will never consider another piece of Abhor-ia furniture and would recommend to everyone to look elsewhere."
1,Another ruined patio,I bought this table along with 5 other Arboria products and all of them released their stain onto my concrete patio after the first rainfall. I can share pics if anyone is interested.I highly recommend against purchasing any Arboria products.
2,Not that fabulous,"I looked at all these reveiws and I thought that it would be so much better than it was. I thought it was wierd, stranmge and confusing. I know everybody thinks this book is fabulous,but I think it sucks bigtime. Sorry to the author but this is really not that great, with like the witch girl, and the slutty friends? No way. THere are way better books out there, If u liked it I'm sorry but it was a sucky book."
3,Entertaining.,I liked it even tho it was kinda young. It was written young but had adult topics so I was torn. Entertaining tho.
4,good book,"Re read, one of my favorite series growing up. The other books are great too, recommend for those who like mystery"
1,I don't know what happened,"I have tried so hard to get into this book. Since I have read other books by this author, I just knew it was going to be great, so I bought the whole series..big mistake. It was boring and I just couldn't finish it."
3,"Didn't quite live up to my expectations, but I'm going to continue the series","I just finished reading Blue is for Nightmares and was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad book. But I didn't see any of the promise I saw while reading her Touch Series.I felt that it read more like a spell book than a drama. She spent too much time on step-by-stepping through the spells and not enough time on setting up the book. Didn't give you much of a feeling for the characters, what they were thinking, who they really were. And the descriptions kept coming piece-meal through the book so your thinks kept changing in my mind. She jumped into the story without enough set up, then kinda rushed the ending (making the ""romance"" part seem like a joke).With that being said, I really did like the Touch Series so I will continue on to the next book with the hopes that she was just ""honing her craft"" with this one. I have faith the series will get better."
4,nightmares make for a wonderful story,"My friend read this book before me and when she described it I was a bit sceptical. I mean, she said it was about a girl who practiced Wicca, had nightmares and wet the bed. Who could like a book about a teenager who wets the bed? It wasn't until a year or so later that I read the book myself. I found that it was well written. Plus it had what I always search for in a book, romance with something attached to it. This book is a supernatural base set in the modern world, about a girl with modern problems. The only weird thing is that she has premonitions. These premonitions while she sleeps add the eerie and mystery to this book, which I absolutely love. It had me ready to read more the minute I was done with it and I was only too glad that the sequeal was there for me to read."
1,*Yawn*,"How on earth is this at 5 stars?The characters are basic, the plot is basic, there's nothing memorable. Magic doesn't save this book from being lackluster. Even when the predictable mystery starts getting solved and there are threatening knives and a girl found dead, it doesn't seem the list bit scary or gripping. Stolarz tried so hard to make the first-person teenage voice, Stacey, sound believable that it really seems like some random, dull girl is giving you a half-hearted, generic attempt at a murder story. I kept reading in the hope that the tide would change and it would start getting good, but it never did."
3,Has potential,"The cover of this one kept catching my eye. I believe its a first novel from this author. She has potential, but she needs to stop channelling Lois Duncan. Her characters, especially the peripheral ones of PJ and Amber, are well-drawn and believable. Unfortunately, the real villian of the tale is rather dull, and pales next to one of his victims, a Snark-Master if there ever was one. I have not continued with the series, but it's on my ""to read"" list."
4,"Loved the cover, loved the book","I saw this book at Borders and was captivated by the mysterious awesome cover(I love the texture of it!), but that wasn't enough. I came to Amazon to check the reviews and decided to buy it; and wasn't dissapointed. This is a thriller that's hard to put down. I have to confess, at times I did put it down, but just because I was too scared and my reading lamp wasn't enough, I HAD to get up from bed and turn on the lights. I don't know, maybe I'm too easy to scare. The point is: if you love magic, spells, witches, being scared and a love triangle, then you have to read this book."
5,Blue is for Nightmares,"This was a very great book. I found it while walking around a book store. I had no clue of this books existence, when i picked it up and scanned the book i thought ""ohh what the heck, I'll give it a try"" well that turned right around with the first chapter of the book. I was transfixed in the pages, being unable to put it down and reading it all night. Blue is for Nightmares was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I showed this book to a friend of mine who is Wiccan and she loved the story and the fact that I and other people (Laurie Faria Stolarz) could find a more spiritual meaning to this religion and less of a broomstick, love spell impression. It was just a great book because it has a mix of everything in it, from teen drama and love stroies, to a mystery, and in someways horror. Its just in all a GREAT book and Stolarz is a great author and I cant wait to see what she comes up with next!"
5,This book sucks you in.,"The writer's vivid descriptions and details and step by step actions of Stacy, the main heroine of this story saga, is quite good. Though not recommended for younger kids/teens, it's a great read for older teens and young adults alike who love suspence. A modern twist on some kind of Nancy Drew."
3,Wicca fun,"I guess I'm not one for mystery. To me this book is more of a mystery & tiny suspense than scary. This book took me awhile to read, The story has alot of potential yet it didnt really do it for me. btw not really much romance either. I'm a sucker for a good love story. I'm really thinking it's really a prefrence thing."
5,I loved it!,"Im 21 I just read this book and let me tell you i didnt want to put it down. It took me 3 nights to finish it. I love the authors writing style getting into detail with certain things making you feel like your right there witnessing everything down to the way someone holds their pencil like a ciggarete! So many suspects, so many questions and all going back to Grandmothers lessons in the craft! As a wiccan it is a great book I will own the others!"
2,First I thought it was ok.....,"I was very excited to receive this plant and it was packed in near perfect condition however once I got it out and replanted it into a bigger pot I noticed the leaves were shriveling. Then I noticed a small snail on one of the leaves. There were two large stems on the plant, it looked like one of them had gotten bigger then had been cut so this second stem was growing from the original one. I didn't think anything of it until a few days later the leaves started to shrivel up, die, and fall. There was severe yellowing and spots all over. She's still hanging in there as I received this sometime early September but it still hasn't bloomed or even hinted towards wanting to bloom. I'm going to be contacting the seller soon and see if there's anything I can do, though I'm skeptical. For the ten or fifteen dollars that it was I could've just gone to Home Depot and buy a plant that I had picked out without the yellowing leaves."
4,Beautiful Plant,"I was surprised how big it was when I opened the package, I thought I was only getting a 6"" plant. When it arrived it was nearly 12"" tall. A beautiful plant, great fresh scent. Can't wait to try brewing my own tea!"
2,Did not survive shipment,"I originally left great feedback for this merchant because of fast service. However after following all directions, the plant just shriveled up and died. I had read previously on the net that some plants just don't survive after being shipped in a cardboard box surrounded by packing peanuts, but I ordered this anyway. The other plant I ordered (Olive Tree, olea europaea) is doing just fine. I tossed the plant away and then contacted the merchant asking for a replacement. They told me to send a picture of the shriveled up plant, and I told them I don't own a camera nor the software or whatever it takes to send a camera picture. That's the last I heard from them. Live and learn."
1,Jasmine plant,"I received the plant. Plant died and called Amazone custmer service. They gave ""round and round""....I will never buy anything from Amazone..."
4,Has grown a few inches with proper care!,"I purchased this plant for my home just a few weeks ago. It came in a secure box-like package that seemed very sturdy. When I first got the plant it was about 8 inches. So it is truly a compact, bright, healthy plant, very shiny indeed. After taking care of it like my own little baby it has grown a few more inches and has even begun sprouting flowers. I will update this review once the flowers get really big and the smell intoxicates the room."
5,Blooming already,"I ordered 4 plants and they arrived today. The plants are carefully packaged and to my surprise, 3 of them are already blooming. Thanks!!!"
1,jasmine maid of orleans,the plant never blossomed. in fact the leaves remained stiff and the plant has no aesthetic quality. it was a waste of money and disappointment that when it finally arrived it was no good. all my other plants are blossoming just fine.
4,Good Product,"The plant arrived safely, promptly and was about 6 inches tall. I'm not sure how they kept it so green, but it was incredibly dry and needed to be handled with care so the leaves wouldn't crack. Once in the soil, it grew very quickly. It's new leaves were soft and healthy. Considering you're getting a plant in the mail, I'd say that this company did it's job excellently. I was not disappointed with the product, nor it's state upon arrival."
1,Dishonest seller,I ordered several plants. They arrived and didn't look like anything in the pictures. One was sick and dying. It was small and only had a couple of branches. I contacted the seller several times but they didn't respond. I finally had to file an A-to-z Guarantee Claim with Amazon. This is a very dishonest seller.
5,Great Plant!,"This was the first plant that I personally ordered online, and I will be honest, I did not get my hopes up on it. Surprisingly, the plant came very well packaged and healthy. I have now had the plant for about 2 weeks under a T12 Growlux grow light, and the plant is just growing like crazy! I would definitely suggest to my friends to buy their plants from this company!"
4,Beautiful Jasmine Maid of Orleans Plant,This was the second time I ordered a plant from online. I was a bit nervous but when the plant arrive I was more than pleased. The plant was in good condition and the packaging was good. I will definitely order more plants from this seller again.
2,map,"They arrived green,but in know time at all,with in two weeks, have dried up and died out. I've tried even cutting them back,but feel they are just not suitable for the indoors. Wish there was notation that warned of this!!"
3,Jasmine Naid of Orleans Plant,"Plant continue growing, couple of flowers bloomed but always fell off the ground, not fragrant but nice flower. My friend had one like this kind of jasmine but her jasmine flower was so fragrant which is should be.This is one of my favorite flower."
3,indoor plant,"The plant came in excellent condition, still very tiny after one month but it is growing well. I hope it will get bigger and bear flowers soon. When it does I will be adding to my review."
4,Perfect indoor flowers,"I bought several plants from Hirt's. They were surprisingly small and weak, particularly when compared to Logee's, the greenhouse that I usually ordered from, although their prices were lower. The Jasmines actually were the healthiest of the lot and flowered within a month, before some of the other plants even grew a new leaf. Judging from the other reviews, I might have been lucky.Jasmines grow easily indoors and are resistant to pests and fungi. The flowers are simply heavenly. They are perfect plants for windowsills."
1,Is this all there is?,Received a twig with two leaves and considering the price it was no bargain. Not even sure it has roots but hope it grows.
4,"Came small, but grew, bloomed after a month or so","I ordered 2 different jasmine plants from Hirts. One of them Maid of Orleans, the other Duke. I wanted them for fragrace and to use in my tea. The plants came in small, but looked healthy. They bloomed very soon after I bought them. I used the first few flowers in my tea and wasn't disappointed. Fragrance was amazing! Just what I was looking for. I have 3 other jasmine plants: 2 plants that are used in perfumes and 1 confederate. None equal to the aroma of Maid of orleans and duke (duke has full dense flowers). This is one year after I bought them all. Confederate is growing the best (doubled in size since I got it 3 months ago and bloomed 3x). This maid of orleans is #2 with growth rate. It bloomed 2 or 3 times this year. It's just about to bloom again. It grew 2 feet this summer. Duke is small and doesn't grow much (my worst plant) from the same nursery."
1,"Very small plant, has been 6+months no flowers","You will recieve it in a small envelope, leaves completely flattened, most will diePlant will grow but may take a year 1+ to flower"
1,Not Worth It!,"My Plant arrived the very next day! and was neatly and protectively wrapped and boxed from 9boxgreen...That's the only positive I have to say! The Jasmine plant is about 4"" in TOTAL height,which includes the 2"" of roots exposed and had 8 very small leaves on 2 stems and of course no flower! Since I have a very 'green thumb' I will nurse this baby to a healthy plant!"
1,Waste of money,"The plant itself is just small and weak, and might be sick. Enough said, the plant simply died after a couple weeks. I am not a florist and I believe any average Joe will have a hard time to keep it alive"
4,Durrell's third novel showed promise of what was to come,"Lawrence Durrell had two novels to his credit ('Pied Piper of Lovers' and 'Panic Spring') when T.S. Eliot, Durrell's editor at Faber & Faber, said that 'The Black Book' was 'the first piece of work by a new English writer to give me any hope for the future of prose fiction'. In a complex tale set in a seedy London hotel, Durrell spun a narrative which was to foreshadow his best-known work of two decades later, the Alexandria Quartet in its dealings with time, characterisation, and narrative. Memorable characters and rich prose swirl around the central figure of Lawrence Lucifer. Considered unpublishable in 1937, it did not find its way into print in Britain until 1961. Well worth the time if you find a copy."
2,Amateur attempt,You could tell this was a beginner. She does have potential and I will try her again.
5,"Lauren for my daughter, Safari for me.","Safari was a bit hard to get used to, as I wear Oriental/florals and this was not. But after using it a few times it's meaning came through. It's for the adventurous in all of us and so hard to find, you're left with either buying the minis or spending $100 dollars for 1.7 oz. It's a treasure and a keeper, for those times you want to take yourself and others on a great journey."
2,Leaky bottle,"I love this fragrance, and have had a hard time finding it anymore as Ralph Lauren stopped distributing it in stores. I was happy with the price point, and excited that after a few years I was able to get my signature scent back; I am disappointed that every time I spray the perfume leaks out the sides of the top and gets all over my hand, making it difficult to apply."
1,will never order from this company again,"After ordering this item and paying in full, it was promptly delivered to the wrong person, in another city-Scentopia was NO HELP AT ALL-they NEVER returned any of my calls -while UPS finally was able to retrieve the pkg and deliver it to me correctly-the perfume does smell a little different than the what it should-this company was so impossible to deal with and the customer service is nonexistant-I will NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN"
2,"Too Strong, Not Unique","Frankly I just don't like this perfume. It has that typical, cloying smell of perfume and smells rather strong, I think. Powerful floral fragrance should be the description on the perfume. If applied lightly it's okay, but in my opinion very typical of a perfume smell. There doesn't seem to be anything particularly unique or enticing in the fragrance.Sorry, but I would not recommend this perfume."
4,Good physics treatment of active noise control,This text offers a good description of the important physical principles underlying active noise control applied to acoustics. Excellent discussion on the theoretical limits to controlling sound radiation using smart skins.
5,Fitted and worked fine,"My fuel pump finally died after 10yrs of working. I was shopping around and found Amazon had the best price of all ($125.00). Even though the picture doesn't the gasket, but it came with it. DIY is very easy, check out some youtube videos. This pump will fit E46 sedan. It's quieter than my old pump. If the price is right, I would recommend this one."
1,not the orig's,"this is janie, and its some of her hits, but it is not the original renditions, just a way to get the customers money for something advertised as something it is not...........and no they don't sound close to the real renditions"
2,American Red Cross Babysitting manual,There was quite a bit of wrting in the book. It may have been advertised this way but I didn't realize it. Everything else was good about the book.
2,Red Cross Babysitting Handbook,"I placed this order on Nov. 26 and after two initutives on my part, am now receiving a refund. J. Rizzo was always very curtious and polite in reply and I would possibly try to order from him again if a need arrose."
4,Funny & HELPFUL,"Simple, straight forward, very useful, but lacking in the elegance that some may require. Enjoyed it throughly and recommend it.This book will help understand some of the ways that you can collect rainwater without over powering your brain. It will also help you to think out side the box, or perhaps in it if you don't mind getting wet.One of the clearest, funniest and most useful books on rainwater."
3,good reference,"As stated, the book contains all 256 plates. But there is almost no informational material. If you just want to know what was included in this series, this is your reference manual."
2,Camping Mat,I was so looking forward to using this product as i thought that Wenger would have produced a much better quality Item. i ended up sleeping on the ground without the mat
3,Not as fluffy as it looks,"The product did self-inflate, but not very much. Left on it's own, it's only as comfortable as the non-inflatable mats (like thick yoga mat). I ended up giving 4 full breaths of air to make it comfortable. With so much air, you barely feel the foam in the mat, which made me upset because I've been on nicer self-inflating mats that rose the full 1.5"" and didn't need additional breaths. The pillow's convenient too. Weight is medium to heavy but still portable. Best left to car-camping. I've used it many times for sleepovers and it's very durable. Wish it came with a sack, but the compression straps are ok."
4,"Not as expected, but still good","The Mat is very well made, but the expectation was for it to be a bit thicker than it really is and also to inflate faster. In general, though, it is pretty good."
2,Swiss gear self inflating mat,This isn't a very good mat I didn't even like slepping on it one night.
1,"Great Price, Does not last long!","I have purchased over 4 of these... all under $25 each.One came out of the package with a split seam and the others lasted one, maybe two trips. I now have an REI self inflating pad."
4,NOTE: Not Identical to the Blue Swiss Army Mat,"I don't usually write reviews but this product is slightly different than the Blue Swiss Army Mat. They appear to be the same, have seemingly identical pictures and are even the same price. We ordered one of each to keep the kids from fighting for their mats and it turns out the grey one is 2 inches wider than the blue one. I guess these swiss mats must have been built by a confederate (gray) craftsman who wanted to make the union (blue) mats inferior."
3,"Ok value, but some things don't work like they should","When I bought this computer 4 1/2 years ago I was motivated in large part by the price. It was seemingly a good deal, big hard drive, etc. But within 2 years the sound card blew out on me, and two days ago the monitor died. Granted, the computer is getting kind of old, by computer standards, but still I feel like it should have lasted longer, as my last computer (a sony) lasted 7 years."
2,A potentially interesting story poorly told,"Setouchi recreates a moment in Japan's Taisho period when radical C20 ideas were being first explored - feminism, socialism, anarchism, free love and all the ususal suspects. Taking the feminist magazine ""Seito"" as her canvas, Setouchi sketches the incidents, affairs and ideas of its leading members, particularly country girl/coquette Ito Noe. Bizarrely, however, Setouchi writes an introductory chapter which summarises the events of the period she is going to cover, depriving her subsequent story of any suspense or tension. Even more strangely, her story stops before the most interesting incidents she has telegraphed start. Overall, one for dedicated Japanophiles or social historians only."
2,Simply impossible to translate,The appeal of Harumi Setouchi is her beautiful prose. It is simply impossible to translate.
4,My daughter has driven this all over the neighborhood,"Pretty easy to assemble - the baby is sturdy and cute - the stroller is very solid and easy to push. The only drawback is how easily the wheels can come off, but this has not been a significant problem. I think this is an excellent value for the money!"
1,I bought this book used for $1.50 and regret it,"First, the content is not well-organized. TV programs and TV memories are generational, so it doesn't make sense to mix images from the 50s-90s together.Second, the photographs have little impact. The book itself is rather small, and some pages contain clusters of small photos that compete for your attention.Third, there is little interesting commentary. A good nostalgia book should describe how pop culture and society influenced each other.This little book doesn't begin to do justice to the most powerful medium of our age."
2,Disappointing Deutermann,"Having enjoyed several of the author's novels, I picked this one up (fortunately at a used book store). SPOILERS: The plot is quite confusing, but the worst thing, in my opinion, is how we are set up for a final confrontation between the villain and our hero, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS. The male protagonist, Train von Rensel seems to be a worthy opponent for the almost super-powered rogue ex-Navy seal. The only reason I kept reading was to witness the clash of these two, only to be let down when the bad guy disappears. Did the other operatives get him? Is he dead? In prison? On the loose? No idea. Almost like the author was planning subsequent novels featuring the same players and left us hanging on purpose (like the ending of the first Star Wars where Vader escapes). Skip this one."
2,"""Be all you can be"", oops, darn, wrong military branch","Perhaps to someone better versed in navy language referring to a character as ""the Admiral"", when there are at least six Admirals in a story, would not be confusing. However, I could not tell who was who, much less why they were behaving in the way they were. What can I say except that the motives were muddy, the plot was moldy, the characters were transparent or opaque, the writing simplistic and the book overall just....boring."
1,Worst Kindle conversion I've seen,"The transfer of this novel from print to electronic form was done with complete incompetence. It appears to have been performed by a CPU challenged OCR program that confused things like the letter ""m"" for ""ii"". The Kindle version contains misspellings and concatenated words on virtually every page. I was constantly being pulled out of the story by jarring copy errors that obviously had never never passed a copy editor's desk after at the OCR program spit out this dreck.If Deutermann's publishers can't spend the time to produce a readable eBook version of his fiction, I don't see any reason to buyany more of his books."
5,Vertical and Vital,"Darrell Evans is a gifted songwriter and worship leader. He writes honest, exciting lyrics and the music is great. It doesn't get much better. If you like contemporary and cutting edge praise, this is for you. Check out his Freedom release, too."
5,BRITISH HUMOUR AT IT'S BEST,MY TITLE SAYS IT ALL. AN ABSOLUTELY SUPERB CAST THAT WORKED WELL TOGETHER. CAN WATCH THIS SHOW OVER AND OVER AND STILL LAUGH JUST AS HARD.
5,Rating for this product,I loved this show on tv years ago. I have missed the humor it has and I have watched this when I really needed a laugh. Great series.
5,Boxed set of DVDs,Merchandise was packaged with care and arrived fast. Quality was excellent! Would recommend you to anyone in the future for movies. I will continue to use you to find quality movies
5,Are You Being Served? The Complete Collection,Are You Being Served? is a delightful British comedy which my husband and I enjoyed each Saturday night at 8:00. We changed TV service and the only PBS station we could get did not include it in the line-up. It had become a tradition for us and we missed it dreadfully. With the DVD's it is once again a part of the viewing tradition in our household.
5,Stephen's Review,"I think that the product I purchased was a great value,easy to find and purchase from this company. I enjoyed the whole experience."
4,"This set starts out wonderful, but the ending, not so much.","This is probably the funniest television show to come out of Great Britain. If the only thing you know of British comedy is Monty Python, do yourself a favor and get this set.The premise of a sit com set in a department store is, I admit, not the most exciting thing, but the comedy, writing and acting are superb and truly makes this television show so memorable and hilarious. The first seven discs are magnificent and, though there are a few camera errors here and there, it does not detract from the overall package.However, as you start to get into disc 8 the original cast starts to become replaced. Though most of the people stay on, beloved characters such as Mr. Granger, Mr. Lucas and the Young Mr. Grace leave the show, and it is never quite the same. The latter episodes are still funny, but they really can't compare to the first few."
5,Great Collection for AYBS fans,"I loved watching this on my local channel, and when I saw the whole collection, at a great price, I didn't hesitate. I just got them a few days ago, and I am laughing my way through each disc.This is one of the best brit-coms in my opinion,The packaging is great, takes up almost no space on my shelf.I love all the characters, (Mr. Humphries, and Mrs Slocombe are my favs)I will never miss another episode again.I laugh everytime, and the dance sequence ones are truly hysterical.""I'm Free""(Mr. Humphries):)""Dead common"" and ""Weak as water,weak as water""(Mrs. Slocombe) lol :)What a gem."
5,Hidden Gem,"This is one of the funniest of the British comedies. Well worth getting the complete collection. I have been laughing since I received it. I have been watching it every chance I get, It is as funny now as when I first saw it. It is subtle yet blatant humor. You do have to pay attention to what is said and how it is said. But I love British humor. Very enjoyable."
5,The Complete collection of Are You Free!,"I have seen most of this series, but I have enjoyed this collection so much I don't care. Great collection - a must have for anyone who loves BritComs!"
3,Funny as heck but missing color,"I gave this complete set to my husband for Valentine's Day. Besides the fact that we received two Season 1-2 and no Season 3-4 (returning it), the first DVD was in black and white. Is anyone else's in black and white?"
2,Quality Control?,"I've only watched three discs in this 14-disc series, but I'm sorry to report that the third disc is defective. The third program on this disc in unplayable; it stops, breaksup and just goes haywire. I'm going to grit my teeth and try further episodes. I really don't want the bother of sending the box of discs back!Jim Taylor"
5,I love it!,"I love my Britcoms, and Are You Being Served is my favorite. I love having the complete series in one box. I just wish it included the movie as well. It's a shame Grace and Favour didn't take off like AYBS."
5,Are you ready to laugh?,"This show speaks for itself, so i'll just mention the quality of the dvd: its just fine. I would recommend this to my friends and family."
5,British comedy at its best!,Being a fan of British comedy I have for many years watched Are YouBeing Served on my local public television station. When it was removed from programming I was so dissapointed and missed watching the shows over and over. This is a fantastic set for anyone who loves the show or British comedy in general......you wont be dissapointed.
5,Classic Britcom doesn't disappoint,"I have followed this series for years on TV broadcasts, but always wanted the full series on DVD.The characters never get old, and the comedy is classic. It is great to have them any time I needa diversion from the serious side of life. Simply put - a great bit of Brit!A great product, nicely packaged, and arrived in perfect condition. Very satisfied."
4,BBC DVD SETS,I have are you being served and Keeping up appearances on dvd.These are great dvds.It would be nice to have THE LIVER BIRDS on dvd as well.
5,Served well is a befitting observation.,"I have always liked the way the Brits entertained, and Are You Being Served is another testimony to their art. I love the inuendos and the descriptive facial and eye movements that add to the enjoyment and humor of the scenes. It is always refreshing to have movie makers who believe that viewers have enough intelligence to get the point! A DVD well worth viewing."
4,A fan of AYBS,"Having been a fan since 1990 something (I first saw this series when I lived in my townhouse then), I have enjoyed it. I taped almost, if not all, of the series including Are You Being Served Again, the Best of Are You Being Served and the movie.The best thing is I got my parents, brother and his son hooked. My nephew, then, took the tapes to his friends homes and had AYBS nights. Even now, when I want to escape from reality, this is the best way to go."
4,For my son,"This item was purchased by my son and his wife. They love that series. I have enjoyed it as well, so I'm sure they are happy with the video."
3,bad disc,I am a big fan of the group but the first disc has a defect. It stops in the first min. of playing the 2nd episode. Then the rest of the episodes won't play when you select it to play. It took a while for me to go through the entire collection. The disc shows no marks or scratches so It must be encoded with a defect. Also tried it on other dvd player and same problem.Wish you could also have the option to continuously play remaining episodes no matter which episode you start.
2,disappointed,"This item states it is a complete collection. It has 54 episodes. On the BBC site the complete collection has well over 100. If it's a complete collection, where are the other episodes? If anyone can clarify this I would appreciate it. There are other items I would like to buy but I can't trust the ""complete"" that's used in the title.Other than that the cds are great."
5,FABULOUS!,"i love this show and would watch it every Saturday when it came on PBS. when i found out that they had released the entire show on DVD, i just had to have it! it has total rewatchability, when i'm bored i'll grab a random DVD and watch whatever episodes it contains! all the characters are dear to my heart, and every episode guarantees laughter!!! :)"
5,A great English Comedy,This is one terrific 70's-80's English comedy. The video was great and the sound excellent. Enjoyed every episode. I was sorry when we got to the last one. I recommend this for anyone who likes the british sitcoms. And those who have never seen these before.
5,Love it!,We loved this series on PBS and are thrilled to own it for ourselves to view whenever we want. Love it!
5,Are you being served? the complete series,"I truly enjoy the 69 episodes. However, I would note that the shrink wrap had a sticker stating ""Alo Alo"" first episode was included but it was not."
3,Just okay,"This particular CD is, from what I can tell by listening to it, material recorded sometime in the early to mid 1970's. The style of the arrangements as well as Ella's vocals here reflect that. The performances are less than spectacular, and if you are not a big fan of Ms. Fitzgerald's, then I would skip this one. But, the CD is far from worthless and I wouldn't hold it against anyone for having this CD."
2,"Great idea, disappointing execution","What's the oldest, hoariest, most boring vampire story imaginable? I'll tell you: a vampire drinks someone's blood and they turn into a vampire too. Eric Savoisin starts out with an intriguing idea--his vampire, instead of drinking blood, drinks the words right out of books. Mix this with a boy who doesn't like to read, and I was ready for him to turn this into one of those books that celebrates the joys of reading. I was disappointed. The plot is the typical plot of other vampire stories, rather than the clever one demanded by the concept. In spite of many nice touches along the way, the ending was a big letdown."
2,Not the greatest book.,"I would question the stated reading level for this book. I find that it is most suitable for children in Grades 2 and 3. I found the plot to be disappointing. Many of the lines end in hyphenated words which is dificult for sight readers. The use of language is fairly colloquial. The book is not very respectful to children. At one point the vampire calls the child in the book a ""foolish kid."" To quote my six year old daughter, she said, ""Look, another sentence that starts with the word 'and'. I found the vocabulary level to be quite mixed making it hard for a beginning reader to comprehend and to read, yet a more advanced reader wouldn't find the plot to be interesting enough."
2,"great idea, big let down","I was excited to read this book because the idea of an ink drinking vampire was intriguing. As I read I became disappointed by the story and the style of writing. The author created an original premise and then fell back on the same tired vampire themes. Why couldn't the vampire live in the library or disappear into the internet? (I don't want to give too much away!) When I saw this book on the Harry Potter ""people who bought this book...."" list, I thought I would give it a try. I wonder if the other people that loved Harry Potter were as disappointed as me."
2,ick!,"Very, very odd story. I didn't like it. I didn't not like it. Just strange. The son of a bookshop owner doesn't like to read and spies on customers - one day he sees a man come in and drink the words from a book through a straw. Yes. Odd. I give it 2 stars for good writing and interesting illustrations but the story was well ... odd!"
4,Extraordinary,This book is about a twelve and a half year old girl who going to get a gazing ball very soon. She finds power in the gazing ball after six months. This book is great!
4,Can't Wait To Read the Rest,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a very easy going, good, clean book. I read it in one sitting. I can't wait for my 9 yr old to read this so we can discuss it and read the rest of the books. I also thought this had a good message of patience and obedience."
1,Zero Stars!,"A horrible movie! The special-effect are laughable, the acting pitiful, and the characters are annoying. When I first saw the previews it Gargantua looked awesome but then I saw it and was extremely disappointing. In video stores they classify this movie in the horror section. . . it should be in the comedy section, you'll laugh so much at this dumb movie. Don't watch."
1,Ugh,"A family of mutated salamanders wreaks havoc on a tiny island paradise. Of course, we're not talking mutation in the real-world sense, which would have meant a sickly little thing with perhaps an extra set of legs, but in the bad-movie sense of the word, which means bigger, stronger, and more ferocious. (Hmmm, perhaps we should be feeding radioactive pesticides to our soldiers to increase their fighting ability...)As some of the other reviewers on this page have pointed out, you might get a kick out of this if you're in the mood to laugh at a bad movie. I found it too dull to be even inadvertantly funny. I like star Adam Baldwin, but I was sorry to see him involved with this mess. The rest of the cast is terrible, the creature design is the pits (think Barney with sharp teeth), the plot twists are ludicrous, and I'm running out of synonyms for 'bad' so I think I'll stop right here."
1,"If possible, use US Postal Service, NOT UPS","There was a problem with the shipping, seller used UPS. Unfortunately, UPS was the incompetent one, insisting that they did not have a complete address. Several attempts working with UPS did not work out. UPS returned item to seller. By the time I contacted seller, the item was resold to someone else."
2,really didnt like,Not a very good movie in my opinion. I am glad I did not purchase this movie. I found it boring
4,Great Book!!,Love this book series. The authors give great ideas and all the info you need in one book.
4,(4 1/2): NotJust a Party Album,"So Jarvis of Pulp, after making one of the great pop albums of the '90s (Different Class), and other world class collections, got fed up with the music industry, the predatory English tabloids and the ""hit singles industry."" So, with a fellow Pulpster, he decided to turn up the volume and have fun. The result is loud and funny - some said the joke wasn't funny enough to sustain a whole album. But keep listening and these songs reveal Jarvis' peerless lyrical wit and ear for hooks. Okay - may as well admit that this won't be for every Britpop fun because the sound is closer to Marilyn Manson than Blur - but, overall: funny, cool, brilliant."
2,"Depressing, in that certain ""Monkey's Paw"" fashion.","After nearly ten years of musical dormancy, Al Barile of SSD fame formed Gage in 1994. He plays bass now. Francois Levesque joined him for the recording of this and the previous album, He Will Come. As a long time SSD fan, these records make me kinda sad. I didn't expect them to be in-your-face raging hardcore of course... but what they are is a 3rd rate Pearl Jam rip off, as if they were worth ripping off. Truly awful. Sometimes the dead should remain dead."
4,A practical approach to leaderhship.,"Tichy and Devanna have produced an easy to read, practical text on leadership. The book demonstrates knowledge of leaderhship studies and research, but is written in a practical, applicable form. A great job of applying the sometimes nebulous subject of leadership into a very readable and useful text!"
1,Misinformation and revisionist history,"The author twists stories and traditions to meet her perspective with no regard for their original meaning, yet claiming that her misinterpretations are the original meanings. One example (of many) is her feminization of the maypole, a rather obviously phallic symbol. This book seems to be a feminist revisionism with little regard to fact. It IS possible to cite facts accurately and still be empowering to women, which this author does not do. She cites no sources for her far-fetched inventions, not surprisingly. I would recommend Lara Owen's book _Honoring Menstruation_ for a more accurate, empowering book."
4,Red Moon -,A friend recommended this book and I have found it very interesting for all women of all ages to read. I believe that men will also benefit as they might gain a better understanding of the cicles of a woman and how these can affect her moods.
2,Bought this for a friend...,A friend of mine wanted to buy it for someone else so I bought it for him on my account.
2,Almost a great player,"This is my second RCA Lyra MP3 player. Unfortunately, I liked my previous player better than this one (I forgot the model # of my previous player). I had no problems with the sound, setup or downloading of music. My biggest complaint is the layout of the MP3 player. It is almost impossible to use the navigation buttons while excercising or moving. It gets much worse when you fit the MP3 player in the plastic holder for your belt loop. I returned the unit b/c it was too painful to use!!"
3,"For $60, it's a good buy","I just purchased it on This black Friday at Fry's electronics. Brand new for $60 without any mail-in Rebate,plus a $10 SD memory card. Overall, for the price this low, that's a good buy for me.If you have a SD momery card, the software is not needed. Just connect it with your computer, it will automatically recognize the momery and you can drag your mp3 to it. It's a snap. FM tuner is the the one i like particularly. If it does not have this function, i would not buy it though. after all, there are tens of mp3 player out in the market that can beat this price and is better-looking. sound quality is decent.the things i don't like:1: when i use the external memory card, i can not see the internal card. i guess you can not use them simultaneously.2: the button is pretty awkward. you have to push hard to activate it.3: transfer speed it slow."
1,Volume Control Problem,"I received the RCA Lyra rd1080 as a bday present from my wife and it worked fine for over a year. Last week, the volume control, which many other reviewers are complaining about, broke for no apparent reason. The volume now only works going up and as a result is stuck on 50. It seems like there is something broken as there is no ""click"" when pressing down. Up until now, I have been reasonably happy with the mp3 player and have even recommended it to others. I use it moderately, usually only hooked up to my car stereo through a cassette deck adapter. However, 1 year is not the lifespan I expect from a very expensive gift - my Sony Walkman (10 years old) is still kicking. I haven't tried calling the service desk, but since the unit is over a year old, I'm not expecting much. Landfills are full of electronic items that have become useless due to one poorly made part. It's disgusting. I'll update this if I get satisfactory results when contacting RCA."
5,Love this Little Gizmo!,"OK, so I'm not the most sophisticated electronics user and am easily impressed, but I have to say that this mp3 player has everything I was wanting and more! At 128 mb it holds more than enough music to keep you entertained for hours, and with the option of random play it should be quite awhile before you grow tired of your songs. Once you do grow tired of them, however, or if you are just looking for much more variety, the expansion slot allows you to easily expand your library without limit. Sure, this little guy may not be as sophisticated as some of the mini jukeboxes, but for the price it offers an incredible capacity with super sound. I would recommend this little guy to anyone, especially someone new to the technology!"
1,"fair product, extremely POOR service","I purchased the RD1080 mp3 player as a Christmas present for my wife. After about a month of service, she began having problems with the player. I followed the instructions in the info booklet, and sent it back to the manufacturer for a replacement. That was about 3 months ago and still no player. What I did get was a $25 phone bill, accumulated while holding to talk to a representative. This is without a doubt, the worst service that I have ever received. Take my advice and skip it."
1,One star rating is too good for this ...,"This product says that it will play mp3's and wma's, but you have to use their software and file format (mpy) to download anything. The manual gave NO help for downloading; it provided on small paragraph for downloand info in ""Advanced Features"" that simply said read the software manual. Furthermore, we could never get wma's to load.Also, we found that it skipped while we were standing still, holding the device.Don't waste your money! We've already returned ours!"
2,"It's a fair player, not recommended","I have had my Rca Lyra player for about a year and a half. It's a great compact little player at first, but the problem is it can barely hold 30 songs. It's durablility is also horrible. Since it is 2 AAA powered, it's battery life is only maybe 4 hours. Maybe the fourth time I was changing batteries, the back to the battery compartment broke! It was held on by a tiny flimsy plastic tip like most shotty electronics are. I droped it form 4 feet one day, and the sound broke so now i can only hear out of one earphone, no matter what quality of hearphone I use.So:Pros: It's compact and its Flash-Drive basedCons: Duribility is horrible, only space for 30 songs, and low battery life.So, now, 1 and a half years later, I'm going to stick with the Creative Labs Zen Touch."
3,good when it works,"sound quality is good, and if you don't mind using musicmatch as the ONLY option to load files, you're fine.However, I have had to delete and reload songs up to 3 times because my player skips through some parts of the songs in fast forward. Tech support is of no help whatsoever - claimed they never heard of the problem."
3,Does not support SD memory cards if running Windows XP,"The packaging says you can upgrade with either SD or MultiMedia memory cards. 128MB and 256MB SD cards do not work with Windows XP. See the RCA site for details, i.e. ""We're working on it.""Otherwise a good player."
5,This MP3 player rocks!,"I bought this mp3 player to use during the witching hours at the 24 Hours of Moab Solo Mountain Bike Race. It worked flawlessly. Downloading music was easy, the earphones stayed on my head solidly, and the music sounded great. While I don't have much experience with other mp3 players, I'm extremely glad that I invested in the RCA Lyra."
4,Two In One,Great product. Lightweight and easy to use while you're working out. Price was worth the cost. FM is a nice addition. I'm going to buy one for my daughter after having this one for 2 weeks. Cheers
2,Would have been great . .. . BUT .. . .,"Alright guys. . . you will see the problems this product has faced. I had it for three weeks . .and Unfortunately had to return the. . I was really bummed. I contact every person involved with the product: RCA, musicmatch, Thompson -- this in itself was an issue. Everyone blamed somebody else, and nobody knew how to help me solve my problem. I was having problems getting the mp3 files to transfer. My 'download' button was inactive. Finally I received a response from musicmatch: ""We are aware of the problem, but have no solution as of yet"" Okay. . what does that mean??? According the to musicmatch Rep. . it had noting to do with my operating system which is Windows ME. I've read countless reviews of this product. . .quite a few had the same problem as me -- I wish it did work out for me. I loved the concept: small, fm radio, memory exspansion, value. If anyone has a solution to the problem, it would be great to hear it!"
1,It's A ... Pet Rock,"I really wanted to love this product (and Consumer Reports and PC Magazine said I would). I returned the first one the day after I bought it. I had clipped it to my waistband as I shot some baskets and went for a jog. I was very pleased with it, until I got home and unclipped it from my waistband. It was still playing but the display had burned out.So I returned it and got another one. I had it out twice, under similar conditions, but this time I wore it around my neck with the supplied lanyard. Then the thing just quit completely. No power, no nothing. (Yes, I tried replacing the batteries.)Given their apparently serious quality control problems, plus the chintzy plastic cover/beltclip and the [weak] headphones (I used another pair), not to mention all the aforementioned software issues, I'd say curb your desire (or at least know the return policy) before you plunk down your hard-earned [money]. Man was I disappointed!"
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could!,"If you're unlucky enough to buy this, then I feel sorry for you.I bought one of these in Oct. 2002. Quirky, but acceptable. The unit's problems are well-documented elsewhere.The screen went completely blank in Jan. 2003. Sent it in for repair. Waited for 6 weeks; it came back with a note saying I needed a return-authorization before I could send it in.Then I called customer service. These people are worthless, and woe unto you if you ever must deal with them. ""We'll send you a new one"". ""We'll send you a refund"". ""We'll offer you a partial refund"". ""We'll send you a different model"".None of these events ever happened, even though my phone calls to ""customer service"" stretched into the summer 2003.Henceforth, I will never again purchase any product with the RCA logo on it. Thomson is their parent company, and I believe they also own the GE consumer-electronics trademark (not sure) - if so, I'll avoid that brand too."
2,Watch out!,"I bought this MP3 player about 2 months ago and I thought it was alright until my volume went out. The volume button on the side will not allow me to decrease in volume. It still works, but only if you want to listen to it at a volume level of 50! I emailed RCA about the problem because I am currently out of the U.S., but they replied that they only deal with warranty issues over the phone. Their customer service online isn't very helpful. So now I just wasted $130 on something that I was only able to use for 2 months!! Be careful if you are planning on buying this product!!"
1,MUSICMATCH made in Hell,"MusicMatch is the worst software ever. DO NOT SUPPORT RCA MP3 players until they support drag and drop. If you can't drag and drop your music files to your MP3 player, you're getting ripped off.iRiver products all support drag and drop. And you don't need MusicMatch's permission to put MP3 files on YOUR mp3 player."
1,Better off buying your own trumpet and drum set,"This does not play MP3 natively!!! You have to install and use MusicMatch .... Audio is ""re-encoded"" into an MPY format which is substantially different than MP3 (although apparently the same exact size), skipping songs takes FOREVER (I have lost relatives faster than I can skip songs with this thing), and if an MP3 wasn't encoded direct from CD there seems to be a substantial (nearly 100%) chance this thing will freak out with it. If it freaks you have to remove the batteries, wait for a new president to be elected, wipe all songs from it and install new songs - which, by the way takes forever (70MB is over 25 minutes on a brand new 2.8GHz machine). Additionally, the ""random"" is just a scrambled order that plays over and over and over (until you add another song with MusicMatch)...."
3,"It's not bad, FOR THE PRICE","On the whole, this is a fine product for the price. It's an inexpensive option for the first time mpg/portable music user. Just be willing to take the time to explore the software (terrible help files) and not have your hopes set on it coming with a great interface. If you're willing to take the time to get familiar with the software and what it can (and can't) do, it's pretty good. Updates are easy and can make it compatible with WMA files as well as mpg. The sound is pretty decent and is even better if you replace the headphones that it comes with. You can drag and drop exisiting files on to the device with Windows Explorer or use the included software.Picky problems - poor carry case, slot for memory card is open (no cover or protection), usb port on device could be better placed, software interface is poor."
1,Software Complaints,"Although I do not know much about such items, I was pretty dissapointed with this item.The expandable memory and ergonomic design of the item is great but the software is garbage. There is an update to make this device compatable with Windows Media Player so that the customer would be allowed to use mediaplayer to download songs. Either the directions are incorrect or the udate does not work. Not very user friendly.The real thing that gets me though is that, when I go to the official music software site, MusicMatch, I cannot download songs that they sell on the website! After downloading songs purchased at MusicMatch, it won't send them to the player because of licensing problems.I should have bought an ipod."
3,Bad software?,"SO far I haven't been able to get the software to work. I try to load the driver, and it goes into terminal pause. I'm running WindowsME. Anyone else have this problem? Anyone know how to fix it, before I return it to the store on September 30, 2002? If you do, leave the recommendation on your review of the product."
2,Pain,"This little guy isn't a bad sounding machine and was not bad for a while. I even recommended it to my roommate. I looked past the long download times, the poor navigation, and the socialist need to use MusicMatch, but the thing broke on me. All the sudden, I started getting ERR IN MEMORY. Nothing I tried seemed to help. Very light and good sound, but not worth it since it only lasted me a few months. Not bad if it we're $$, but for this price, get somthing else."
4,Really good!,"Unlike the corny tv show, this comic is not only awesome, but more realistic.(In some ways.) I reccomend it to all who enjoy the pokemon franchise."
4,Just as great as the first one,"This is the second book in the Pokemon Adventures comic series. Actually, let me correct myself, the second 208 page book (they released the books smaller at first). This book has great sections, including the Safari Zone. In this book Red also meets up with a tricky girl named Green. The Pokemon Adventures series is based on the gameboy games."
2,Not impressed!,"This cd is lackluster at best. The best song on it is Um Good, and it's not that great either. Perhaps I would think better of this cd if it had been Smokie's freshman project. But this is the 3rd cd from him and I expected it to at least meet, if not exceed, the bar set by the first 2 projects. I keep hoping that it will grow on me, but that hasn't happened."
3,interesting theory,"Stark's writing of the book is problematic because it is cluttered and very hard to comprehend. Although Stark's struggle to combine sociological and historical disciplines can be problematic, this scholarly work is NECESSARY in understanding the controversies of Christianity's historical origins.Stark's information is concise, thorough, and very informative."
2,Big Problems,"Dangerous. A little learning is a dangerous thing. Rodney Stark has plenty of sociological learning, but little historical. His overall treatment of Judaism is deeply problemmatic, even if he does a decent job in the single chapter that focusses on it.As with any book done ""outside"" an author's field, there are hits and misses; in this case the misses are horribly off the mark"
5,Great! It addresses all the questions we ALL want to ask.,"Great!! This book takes all the hard questions, and gives us clear answers that don't leave us wondering 'how does this translate to real life.' The chapter on 'What Can I do with My Moods?' really helped me. Buy 2 copies one for yourself and one to share with a friend!"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book for a small Bible study group that I was in. While I enjoyed some of the questions, the way they were answered and presented did not engage me. I felt that Dr. Oglivie just wrote what he thought the answer was, but did not offer complete Biblical references to his answers. Or he would say that he interprets a verse one way resulting in answer A, but when I read the same verse, I would interpret it another way, resulting in another answer. It just seemed to me that he ""interpretted"" scripture to make his answers work, but that does not necessarily mean that it is the correct answer. I was ready to be done with the book by week 2."
5,Not received,"I have not received the book yet. Nearly a month has past since I ordered it, and I have not received it."
3,Great sereis. Poor quality Region 1 DVD.,"The content: this was a great series. I watched it with my younger siblings after school back in the '80s. Much nostalgia here. That is preserved.The box says ""fully restored picture &sound.;"" Don't believe it. I have both the NTSC Region 1 and the PAL Region 2 sets. While the NTSC version has much reduced noise and grain, it has much lower detail as well. Additionally the telecine process they used is way off so any modern playback device will get a bit confused. Every mistake you could make mastering these DVDs was made. Crushed blacks, bad cadence, ham-fisted noise reduction. It's a poster child for how not to master animation on DVD.If you care about video fidelity as well as nostalgia then get the Region 2 discs, assuming you have a way and know how to play them of course.Five Stars for the contentOne Star for the mastering qualitySo: three star rating."
5,At Last MCoG gets the official U.S. DVD release it deserves!,"At last this gets a U.S. DVD release. Originally screened on Television by Nickelodeon in the 80's.

1,"Amazing series, ruined by single layer disc use!","This series is an absolute classic make no mistake, but what VCI has done with this is so crazy it borders on lunacy. They have taken a series which was previously released on dual layer discs(the runtime on each disc goes way beyond the 3 hour mark in total) and looks fairly good, and crammed it onto 6 single layer dvd5's. The result? Awful 1-3mbps video bitrate, and HEAPS of compression/artefacting issues to add to the already old look of the show.A total poster child for how not to treat animation on dvd, and a god awful effort from this firm VCI.I am an international buyer from the UK, and i only bought this NTSC R1 version to avoid NTSC-PAL conversion issues, but honestly i wish i hadnt bothered as at least the UK set come on dual layer discs with proper video bitrates, and from what i can tell better video detail aside from that too.Hugely dissapointing."
2,"This is ""deluxe?""","No languages other than English? How about the original Japanese and/or French? No subtitles? Fail. I'll save my money until such time as there's a REAL ""deluxe"" release."
4,"works great, volume can be bigger",our stir fry vege dishes taste much better after this helps spin out most of the water. the center spin column is a bit bulky reducing the usable bowl space. others already commented about the difficulty of cleaning the column.
4,Salad spinner,Best salad spinner I have used. Others have been much flimsier plastic. None that I have found so far will stand up to a dishwasher for long.
4,Salad Spinner works well,"The spinach and vegetables I buy still have a bit of dirt on it when I get home, and its usually a hassle to wash all of it but the salad spinner makes things pretty easy, and Im not left with soggy greens afterwards. Definitely a worthy buy."
1,More of a toy than actual need,"I thought that this would actually be something that I would need when I registered for this for my wedding. But this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use. Sure kids might like to use it when they cook, but in all the time that I have owned one, I have only used it once. Its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards. You are better off without it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"My husband bought the OXO salad spinner (the only one available in most of the local stores) when my previous salad spinner, a Zyliss, was lost in a move.I was disappointed from the beginning. The OXO spinner's action is inferior to the Zyliss, which spins in two directions and gets the greens much drier in less time. Also, the construction of the lid allows water to collect between two ""layers"" where it is impossible to wash properly or to dry, allowing mildew to grow.After two years of almost daily use, the push-down mechanism in the lid became completely inoperable and I had to discard the lid as useless. (I'm keeping the inner basket to plant summer bulbs in to make them easier to lift and store in the fall.)I have just purchased anotherZyliss Salad Spinner from Amazon and was astounded to see that it is only half the price of the OXO. It arrived this week and I couldn't be happier with it. Don't spend twice the money for an inferior product!Sora Colvin"
2,Not well thought out,This book has good info but the way it was organized was not effective.Someone who will use this kind of book will have specific areas to address andyou must trudge through random order and highlight areas and organize yourself.Many better books than this on the subject.
1,Poor Quality,"The chisel stays sharp but the head on the bit breaks within a few days use. We have a mortiser that we use in a production type atmosphere and it gets used. We have purchased several bits looking for something that maintains a good edge and stays sharp for a long time. These bits were not it. The chisel works and lasts but the head on the bit has broken several times, sometimes within hours sometimes 3 or 4 days. Unfortunately because the bit breaks the chisel is useless. We are still in search for the perfect bit."
1,Exactly as awful as expected,"A while back my friends and I bought a bunch of cheap and likely terrible games to play on a Saturday. The requirements were that the games had to be something we didn't have and it had to have multiplayer. This game was slow, hard to understand and mostly just really boring, it was by far the worst of the bunch."
2,Cumbersome,"This is one game I'm glad I rented instead of bought. I just couldn't get into this game.It's tough to get the proper balance if you're making a strategy game that includes actual first person fighting. Strategy games involve a lot of micromanaging of your units and it's hard to do that if you're sitting in a cockpit. The game basically tries to do too much. The interface and controls always felt awkward to me even after I'd been playing for hours.The graphics aren't terrible, but are a little weak for a xbox 360 game."
2,You should know this before you buy,"This is an innovative game in many ways, and most missions are a lot of fun. Especially cool is the ability to go from armchair admiral to the thick of the fighting with the press of a button, and back again.However this game has a serious flaw. There are NO save points or check points. You die and you start the entire mission over from the very beginning, and some of the missions and ship/submarine challenge missions are very LONG and very hard.Therefore the game can get frustrating especially on the hardest ""veteran"" level. After your ship/sub/plane goes down a few seconds before victory, you end up asking yourself ""do I really want to spend another 20 minutes setting up my approach? or go to a GAME THAT HAS SAVE POINTS."""
5,This game is AWESOME!,"I bought this game for cheap on eBay...and wasn't expecting much. It looked like a 90's computer game, but I decided to give it a chance since was for the XBOX 360. I got so much more than I bargained for! This game is extremely realistic - all the way down to controlling how the crew attends to damage control. I'm very impressed with the realism and how fun it is to control the navy ships."
2,pass on this,"I had a very hard time getting into this game. It sounds cool, got good reviews, but just didnt work for me. I think they tried to do too much with this and it ends up being a mosh of controls and a strange mix between tactical execution and strategic planning."
3,"Good idea, not well implemented","I'm into turn-based strategy games like Civilization, Axis & Allies, and Chess. Real time strategy games like Warcraft tend to overwhelm me with micromanagement. Battlestations Midway is real time strategy, but most of the game involves the management of fairly slow naval units, so I thought I could handle it.Everything was going fine for the first few hours. Compelling story, nice graphics, I felt like I was learning quite a bit about the Japanese and US Pacific Fleets in 1942, until I hit a mission in which I took control of the USS Lexington, an aircraft carrier. Turns out that if you give multiple aircraft squadrons orders to land at the same time, none of them land, they just circle the carrier. By the time I figured out how to remedy the situation, the Lexington was on her way to the murky depths. Not fun."
5,Laugh Machine,"Les Luthiers is probably the funniest musical group I've ever seen (and listened to)!I had a couple CDs but had never seen them playing...Oh they're SO funny!!!!! It's not something I can describe, you have to buy this DVD and see for yourself!This DVD has subtitles in spanish, portuguese and english so anyone can understand!Great buy!"
5,Very moving,"I received an awesome dileverence in my own home for the first time without the aid of a pastor or church gathering. Just me and the Holy Ghost! And while I'm still riding my storm,the song ""This Test is Your Storm"", keeps me going. I'm grateful and blessed for this experience and Thank you TD Jakes and the Potter's House for your obedience to minister in song. I would also like to know if this song is available in just instrumental. Please reply. Thank You."
4,"A fresh, fun voice","Megan Frampton's debut book is smart and fun. The story of an impoverished blue stocking and a faux-impoverished earl is told with wit and charm. The heroine's anonymous newspaper column, ""Reports from the Battlefront,"" about her search for a husband, begins each chapter, and provides a hint of our heroine's wry humor.A Singular Lady is not perfect, but it is well worth picking up. Ms. Frampton is an original. Her unique voice and intelligent writing make her someone to look for in the future."
1,"Quite inappropriate, Very disappointing","I am a true hopeless romantic, absolutely obsessed with Regency Romances. I have stumbled upon the series of Signet Regency Romances, hoping they would be sweet and tame. Unfortunately, ""A Singular Lady"" was nothing of the sort. I was highly disappointed. The characters have zero time to develop before they are immersed in 'scandalous' behavior. The premise itself of a poor and desperate woman seeking a rich husband to save her family only to fall in love with a man whom she assumes to be poor like herself could have been rich and entertaining, but the overall embarrassment of such blushing scenes ruined the entire book. Intense and yet subdued romantic moments between well-explained characters can be a true treat!... But this was not what I found in ""A Singular Lady."""
1,Not Really a Regancy,"I gave this book a 1-star rating because it is not really a ""Regency"" romance. It is a ""Romance"" set in the Regancy period, but it is not really a ""Regancy"" romance. There are certain characteristics that make a romance a ""Regancy"" romance as all die-hard Regancy fans know and this book does not even begin to fit the bill. So, if you are a die-hard Regancy fan you will probably not like this book. However, if you're a romance fan you probably will like it."
5,EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED,I recommend this product highly. Good quality. It hangs right on the hangar bar which keeps it from tearing and maximizes the useful storage area.
5,Personalizing the Chaos in the Middle East,"As a suspense author with my debut novel in its initial release, I admire John Le Carre's LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL because it achieves what all authors of such types of fiction hope to achieve. Le Carre takes the complex issues involved in the Middle East and personalizes these issues with an intricate plot and vividly drawn characters. He makes the underlying and conflicting truths beneath this permanent international hotspot comprehensible to all who read his novel. Charlie, a beautiful actress, is lured into participating in a mission to entrap a Palestinian terrorist. Le Carre avoids simple answers and presents the views of all sides fairly. LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL is a terrific book, one I always recall when there is additional senseless violence in that most unfortunate world region."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Little Drummer Girl involves a conflict between Israeli and Palestinian spymasters, basically. The Israeli man choose an actress to use as an agent to further his ends, and the book follows her adventures and problems throughout.The major problem with it is you are not quite sure why the woman is doing what she is doing, so doesn't hold up as well when that doesn't make sense."
4,The Little Drummer Girl,"Love this book. LeCarre is the master of intrigue and espionage fiction. He's head and shoulders above the rest. His character developement is so life-like and their humanity shines through. Their weaknesses, their vanity, their conflicted heroism, their pain. Closer to reality and absent of the trite, overused and clich'ed spy novel storylines. Not for those looking for an easy, gratuitous,(and typical)thrill-read. But very good."
5,Best fiction on the middle east since the bible,"Like most le Carre novels, the spy story is the canvas to paint a majestic portrait of the people, the region, the art of deception.I have known Jewish people who criticize this book as being pro-Arab, as well as Arabs who criticize this book as being pro-Zionist. Which of course means how fairly he treats the two.All in all, an excellent read. The movie, however, was an absolute flop. Why do Hollywood fools insist on American characters?"
2,An anti-terrorist book written by a dreamer!,"How could you pick a woman and made her to become the girl friend of a terrorist who you guys wanted to catch? A totally ridiculous creation by Le Carre. I've suffered a serious leCarre syndrome after I've translated this book since there were so may flaws in this book that even the writer himself might not be able to justify. A tedious, boring, dream-like progress of the typical endless English blabblings, totally unplausible, ridiculous and quite unreadable. The movie was also a bore-to-death product. Only ""THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD"" is highly recommended. If you want to find the earliest gay complex in the English military-transformed-into-civilian intelligence communinity, you may read his ""Looking Glass War"", but unfortunately, it's still a very childish writing and a quite ridiculous story; if all the English intelligence people were all the jerks like what leCarre described, the Soviet already won the cold war"
5,Very effective,"I have been doing the exercises in the book for two weeks and I have already seen a big difference in my golf swing. As advertised, I have seen improvement in flexibility, strength, mechanics, and the mental approach to the swing. Rather than thinking during the swing, I am just swinging. Excellent help for my golf game."
3,Better Get the Video Too,"I love the concept... that the swing was broken down into all of it's phases and the the exercises are designed to reinforce the muscle tone and muscle memory required for a better golf swing. However, the written directions are complex and the visual aids are of poor quality so it is possible to do the exercise wrong with out knowing it. I'm sure the video would be a great supplement to the book."
5,An Outstanding Resource,"I have spent time working with Neil applying this fitness program. This book is a cutting edge resource, especially in the area of fitness and nutrition for golfers."
5,"Excellent book for Golfers, Trainers, PT's and Golf Pro's","The golf swing is a pure chain reaction. Neil has an intimate understanding and knowledge of the chain reaction of the entire body for the golf swing. His knowledge makes this book an invaluable tool for the every golfer, trainer, therapist and golf professional. I give this book my unqualified recommendation."
3,Just too much,"It's good information, but more than I'll ever need by a factor of 5. There is a very useful technique for scoring your game, so you have a record of exactly what happened on the course, and you know what to work on. But, there is just too much for me, a beginning golfer, and for my brother (I tried to pawn it off on him), who's a mid-level player. I wish I'd returned it."
1,"A few good ideas, poor presentation/layout","Not easy to follow, but a few interesting exercises I have added to my routine. Some of the sections are just not adequate compared to other books/plans, for example, the aerobic/endurance section. Looks like it was thrown together over the weekend at Kinko's."
1,"Borrow Some, Discard the Rest","I did this program instead of my regular program with some interesting results. My golf was about the same, but my feel in my short game was better, which I attribute to moving in different directions in the program. I might have gotten the same thing from basketball, I don't know. However, after 2 weeks of this, I felt my overall strength and endurance was down from previous. So what I did was borrow some of the movements, added them back to my regular routine of basic weight training and cardio work. Borrow the book from a friend or library, copy the best exercises and don't bother with it after that."
1,Mucho Hype/Minimal Delivery,"Poorly produced with a few radical concepts about sport-specific conditioning as it relates to golf. I doubt anybody on tour uses this stuff, just too funky."
4,Bedtime reading for philosophers,"If you like philosophy and get turned by Yoga, this is a book for you. The chapters are pretty technical and full of yogic terminology, but the presentation is sound and endlessly fascinating. The book has my vote."
5,Very good service,Bought the book for a gift and the recipient loved it. Got the book in a timely manner right before Christmas. Good service.
4,"A great, old fashioned western","A great book, typical of Compton! My only complaint is that he wasn't up on his clothing details to fit the historic old west, but that doesn't take away from the story. If you want the same type of story as Compton, but more accurate in details, read Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'Amour. He is neck and neck with L'Amour and Compton in every way!"
3,it's okay.,"i think it makes things more complicated than they really need to be but it takes great pictures. also....after purchasing the product, i learned that the camera has to have a proprietary zoom lens that is way more expensive than say, canon. but other than that i am very happy."
4,Movies with audio?,">shoot short videos (without audio)The odd thing is that the review says ""without audio"" (as above) but the Olympus website says it works with audio as the 5050 etc do. Any idea why it would say that?"
3,this is a GOOD cd more like a 3.5 almost a four star,"this cd isn't great because of some amazing musical breakthrough or killer sounds (although the sound is good). its more about being a clever, funny, spoken word analysis/satire of the state of our society and culture. for that reason it is very valuable. there are some just killer trackers on here that i listen to again and again. if you like a little more thinking or intelligence in your music, this might be it. also, if you like a little wacky silliness, this might be it. this cd is a quirckily similar yet strangely different approach to the sort of stuff Utah Phillips and Ani Difranco do."
1,INCOMPLETE TOOL,"I DO NOT LIKE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE be incomplete, missing two CHISEL Game.ensure a complete product. to not create any deception, Worked very well. Strength and Impact GOOD IN THE HAND BE"
3,A Bridge Too Far,"The setting and most of the characters are the same as the 5-star first three years, but the character development and dramatic tension are missing from these adaptations (no drama of being a new vet; no improbable, amazing romance; no Tristan out at all hours--will he ever pass his exams?; no Siegfried visiting ""mother""; no war looming). The actors and directors seem to be going through the motions without much zest, most lamentably the previously full-of-life Robert Hardy."
4,More Bloopers and extras,I still enjoy All Creatures Great and Small after all these years. Can someone tell me why the Overseas Dvds have different extras. I bought my series 4 in Australia we didn't get that joke with Robert Hardy. Bit disappointing. Also they should have more commentaries as they are quite good.
3,All Creatures Great & Small - The Complete Series 4 Collection,"Series 4 is the least favorite of the esteemed installment. However, it picks up midway through. In all, still an enjoyment to visit the Dales nonetheless."
3,Crabby James.....,"m'I the only one who has noticed that one of the unhappy aspects of season Four is that James seems crabby with his family and his customers? He snaps at everyone and does not seem to be the old James Herriot. He states that he loves the people of the Yorkshire Dales, but he seems to have lost his patience with them. Season Four starts off on the dry side but comes around toward the end. The shows do get better but it takes awhile. The music has barely improved, the series will never win any awards for that! But, I do not watch it for the music.....Poor Lynda Bellingham, she could not possibly come up to anyones standards. I think she does the best she can with a script that does not really give her much to work with. That said, I'm half way thru season five and it is getting better all the time and James seems a little less crabby!"
5,All Creatures Great and Small,This is the 4th in the series that I have ordered from Amazon. All have been purchased as gifts for a family member. They are all wonderful. I intend to continue ordering the collections until I have the complete set.
2,product service,"very pleased with the dvd content, but disappointed that i had to pay 9.70 customs fee upon delivery and the dvd will not play on my multi-region player, although supposed to be a region 1 item."
1,The 4 series,"Since I ordered all The Creatures Great & Small it was a while before I veiwed the 4th series. This series of DVD's are unwatchable. I think the first DVD is OK but from there on they are bad, very bad. I am not sure what can be done about the problem, but would like to have it resloved. JanetteJanChildress@comcast.net"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I AM A FAN OF THE FIRST THREE SERIES. I BOUGHT THEM ALL AND LOVE THEM ALL. THAT SAID, AFTER THE FIRST ABYSSMAL EPISODE OF THIS SERIES I'VE SWORN THEM OFF.THE NEW HELEN MUST BE A RELATIVE OF THE NEW DIRECTOR IS MY ONLY GUESS. THEY'D HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE MOVED A MANNEQUIN ABOUT. HER ACTING IS THAT BAD, WHAT THERE IS OF IT. AND WATCH JAMES AND YOU'LL SEE HE'S AS DISAPPOINTED AS WAS I.WANT MORE? THE SETS HAVE LOST THEIR FEELING OF REALITY. THE DIRECTION IS FORCED. AND WHATEVER FEELING THE CAST HAD IS GONE, LOST, HISTORY. CAROL DRINKWATER, THE ORIGINAL HELEN HAD IT RIGHT WHEN SHE JUMPED SHIP ON THIS ONE. IT'S A SAD THING TO WATCH A CAST RAVEL BEFORE YOUR EYES TAKING A BELOVED STORY WITH IT, BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS EVISCERATED CORPSE OF A SERIES.OKAY, READY FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE? THE MUSIC IS BETTER. SEE, I'M NOT SUCH A NEGATIVE BLOKE. BUT, PLEASE, FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, SPARE YOURSELF THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THIS SPUTTERING FAILURE."
3,"Creatures fans should own it, but....","Lynda Bellingham compromised this series. She was wooden and lacked the softness and warmth of Carol Drinkwater. Made me miss the ""real"" Helen... Other than that, another fine job by Robert Hardy, Chris Timothy, and Peter Davison. Undoubtedly, Creatures is the finest program ever produced, in my opinion."
3,"Very mixed, unfortunately....","I absolutely adored the first three, and the specials... but this seems to have lost its way. There's the replacement Helen, and the trouble is that she's been replaced by someone who lacks the heart and the charm of Carol Drinkwater. Linda Bellingham seems more like someone's slightly stern nanny, and everyone in the cast reacts that way to her. And that's what's really wrong... the lightness of touch is gone, the actors seem awkward and uncomfortable with each other (especially when Helen is present), and it's not so much that they're older but that they're, I don't know, going through the motions, I suppose... with the possible exception of the ever-stellar Robert Hardy. You'll want to see these once, if you're a fan, but I don't think that I'll ever want to watch them again. I prefer to think of James off somewhere in the Dales, living happily ever after with the real Helen."
5,Excellent acting in these movies,Always watched this on television and enjoy the good acting in this seriesa most for all who like police serieschfancier
4,jewel of hari,how do you know what is being chanted? how do you know what the words mean? is there a translation included?
4,Worked OK so far...,"I ordered this just before there were any other reviews made, so I didn't see anything negative (or positive) about it here. I can say that the wheels are not the best, although mine seem to have held up so far. It gets my dishes nice and clean, and I haven't had any problems with leaking. I rather like it, but if it breaks soon, I will post again here. If nothing is heard, assume that it is OK! I have heard bad things about customer service at Haier, though, although I have not experienced it myself. Overall, not bad for the price."
2,Do not buy poor quality,"I bought this applicance for a disabled young adult who has trouble washing disher. This dishwasher is very low quality, the back panel is cardboard. Wheels fell off, 10 inch dinner plates do not fit. Hose connection and electric cord does not store after use. The poor guy had water all over his kitchen floor day on 2. I wouldn't suggest this appliance to anyone."
1,Awful Product,"The top of the dishwasher keeps popping off, the bottom rack does not load anything like the picture and it does not clean the dishes at all well. The inside back of the dishwasher is curved so it is hard to get plates in and it just does not clean dishes (especially silverware) at all well. This product is a lemon!"
1,Do not buy!!!,I found the same issues as Emily. The top of the dishwasher was cracked upon receipt. The dishwasher would alarm 30 seconds after starting a cycle. I contacted tech support at Haier and they told me it was alarming because there was water in the bottom of the dishwasher. They had me lean it forward to drain out the water and the front 2 wheels broke off. I tried to start another cycle and it had the same alarm. Very poor construction. I also returned the dishwasher for a refund.
2,Not recommended,"1- Doesn't fit full-sized dinner plates. 2-Hose assembly complicated and poorly designed, compared to other portables. 3-One wheel was broken upon delivery, and even the ones that ""work"" don't rotate properly."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I was so excited about getting this dishwasher, and what a disappointment it turned out to be. The wheels broke off immediatly after unpacking it, and water leaked all over my kitchen floor. Very poor quality, I'll be returning it for a refund."
1,Horrible Product,I received this dishwasher as a wedding gift. I have used it two or three times and am going to return it. The machine doesn't dispense the soap properly and leaves chunks of detergent on the dishes. They are left streaked with soap and come out looking worse than when I put them in. The machine also doesn't drain properly. The water stays at the bottom of the machine and I have to manually drain it by fiddling with the drainage hose. The wheels are also very shoddy. Dinner size plates do not fit at all and you can't fit very many dishes overall. This wouldn't be too big of a deal if there weren't a myriad of problems to begin with.I would recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! You will be severely disapointed and will return it.
1,"overview of OLDER macintosh models, it lacks information","This book is userfriendly with BIG illustrations and little in-depth information. It covers the basic of hw and sw on the mac, but doesn't really tell you anything about mac specific hw if you have knowledge of pc hw already. I was looking for extensive information on the layout of the powermac but that is not to be found here, only includes a light sketch of the ppc 601 and ppc 604. This book would be ideal, I think, for the computerillustrator who knows nothing about his machine. Or children maybe. I'd say it's kind of weird because it mixes more complicated details with some very basic stuff, all kept in an appearently easy to understand graphic design. The rating is given on this background, if I didn't know nothing about computer hw I'd probably give this bok a higher rating."
4,"Very good, completely comprehendable...but needs update!","As an instructor of computer graphics for designers I give very high marks to this publication. Great images, captions and text. For introductory students all is approachable and the gamut of material is broad enough to go on helping outside of the classroom when it comes time to configure their own work stations. Understanding how it all works helps and helps again when trouble shooting. This publication is too old now (1996) so I hope Ziff Davis is listening in!"
1,More than 5 years old,"As a technology educator, I can not give a book about computers a good review when it is more than five years old. This book is about Macs, but predates the iMac.If you want to learn how computers work, get something newer."
5,Its very goood!! I love it!,I used for my Spanish class and was excellent resource. Help me a lots!! It's very useful for elementary bilingual teachers especially. Thanks.
5,He did it again!,"Another great story from a gifted author. A personal favorite. Peace & Memory is a richly detailed, compelling tale of human motivations and frailties. Once started, it is very hard to put down. Highly recommended. I can't wait to read his next novel."
4,No subtitles!,A brilliant series and I was overjoyed to receive the discs all of which were in excellent condition. Despite the description though there are no subtitles a huge disappointment to me and my hoh husband.
5,Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet,"If you loved watching this series on PBS as much as I did, you will love this boxed set of all the episodes. Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth Bucket-pronounced bouquet as she loves to remind people) does physical comedy so well. This show comes with such a wonderful cast of characters. So clever you will want to watch the episodes over and over again."
5,Fantastic TV Series,I thought the I Love Lucy show was good comedy until I came across this BBC series. Hyacinth views on proper etiquette and the way she worries about how society is watching every move she makes. It is important to her that everything is very proper and Hyacinth is a snob which is obvious when her sister and Onslow are around.I think that Patricia Routledge is excellent at comedy and is good competition for Lucille Ball. If you enjoy Lucy you will enjoy Hyacinth even better. The British have a great sense of humor. I can watch Keeping Up Appearances over and over it is one the funniest programs I have come across.
5,Great,This series was just what I expected. i love to watch Hyacinth and her family and friends. it is a great pick me up when you need a laugh.
4,Happy with purchase,"I am glad to have the entire collection, I thought there had been more episodes than I had viewed on my local PBS affiliate and was pleasently surprised to see that I had seen them all.We all have a friend (or two) who resemble the characters !"
4,keeping up appearances,Again and again and again....Hyacynth never disappoints. She & her boquet of relatives/neighbors never let me down. It's silly & fun and rather repititious; but she always looks and smells pretty. Put her in a pretty vase with water and watch.
3,Keeping up appearances The full Bouquet,"the video set was a gift for my Mother,as she loves the episodes as I do.for the price i paid i thought i was receiving more than just 7 or 8 shows.had I known so few were included i never would have paid so much money.whomever writes the advertising for the videos should be more specific!Keeping Up Appearances: The Full Bouquet"
5,Great entertainment,The actress (Patricia) in Keeping up appearances is very good. It is wonderful to hear the different English accents of the UK. Some scenes take place in the beautiful English countryside.
5,Hilarious,I bought this set for my husband and he absolutely loves this series. I've even watched some of them with him and they are histerical. The product also arrived in a timely manner even during the Christmas season.
5,My thoughts on Keeping Up Appearances,I have seen Keeping Up Appearances on PBS over the years. British Comedy is nicely done. The comedy is very different than from the US. I watch these videos over and over again for a good laugh.
5,Keeping Up Appearances,"LOVE, LOVE IT!!! Many Thanks to Hyacinth, Richard, Daisy, Onslo, Rose, Daddy, Liz & Emmet, & Bruce. :)"
4,Excellent,"Patricia Routledge is wonderful as the bossy, domineering Hyathinth Bucket (pronounced ""bouquet,"" if you please), set on making a good impression in society--with adverse results. She terrorizes her neighbor Elizabeth and her brother Emmett, the postman, the vicar and his wife, her sisters and brother in law, and even her own husband!All 40-some-odd episodes are presented in this set, with a special ""holiday"" disc with four episodes on them. This was the thing I didn't like about the set--these episodes are not in order with the reast of the series. But Keeping Up Appeances is one of the best TV shows out there!The 8-DVD set also includes deleted scenes from the various episodes and a commericial, with scenes from Patricia Routledge's Kitty Monologues. These monologues are just as worthy of watching as Keeping Up Appeances is."
5,Very Funny,"If you like British Comedy - This is a great set. Hyacinth Bucket thinks she's high society and does everything she can to ""Keep up Appearances"". The things she gets herself and her husband into are great... not to mention her ""poor subjects"" her next door neighboors... along with her sister and brother-in-law that are living well below her standards. I like that most of the characters can see through Hyacinth and her facade as they roll their eyes or try to change their schedule to avoid being seen by her... totally funny."
5,KEEPING UP APPEARANCES-THE FULL BOUQUET SET,"If you are a fan on this wonderful british comedy, then this is a must have for your collection. The series runs on PBS and BBC america but that just is not enough. This box set contains every episode. Its not cheap but its worth every penny. My wife and I love everyone in the Bucket oops Bouquet residence but especially Onslow and Daisy!"
5,Keeping Up Appearances DVD set,"I have enjoyed this series for several years on public television. There are so many shows, and they are all so great, that I doubt I will ever tire of them. On the DVDs, the color saturation and detail is much better than the aired shows (from my source), and the audio is the usual BBC superb.Watching eccentric snooty Hyacinth trying to deal with her equally eccentric sisters is always good for a loud laugh. I know a few people just like her! Unfortunately, we lost actor Geoffrey Hughes who plays Onslow, last July 27th 2012 to cancer.This is a great price for the entire series. An addtioinal treat: A few of the shows have never been aired here in the states."
4,This will keep you laughing,"A moderate value for the price, this is a great collection of the whole series. Get it before it's discontinued. Even if you haven't seen it before, consider renting it or buying Season 1. You'll probably be hooked. It is somewhat overlooked in the history of British comedy shows, but is not to be dismissed. Granted, it is not as subtle as series such as 'Monty Python' or 'The Vicar of Dibley' but has its own quirky charm. Many characters will probably remind you of people you know. Don't miss this."
4,Great British Humor,"This series is well worth watching.While the subject matter does get repetitive, and they do have several running gags, it is hilariously entertaining.The main character is a middle-class snob from a lowly upbringing whose exaggerations and bragging get her into embarrassing situations.It's an excellent premise, which allows the writers to nearly effortlessly entertain you episode after episode."
5,A great show!,I love this show! Hyasinth is hilarious and you'll LOVE to hate her! All the charachters in this show go great together! A must watch if you love British humour!!
5,A Treasure!,"British comedy at its finest! A nine disc set with lots of extras that you would expect in a special edition. A excellent transfer, picture and sound quality are top notch. Best of all is the case, which keeps the discs snug, yet easy to get to with no hassle and with beautiful art work through out. Its so funny that I never tire of watching it, worth every penny."
5,Keeping Up Appearances - The Full Bouquet,"Even though I've seen most of these episodes I never seem to tire of our Hyacinth, her hilarious family, and her endless social climbing fiascos."
5,Great Entertainment!,"This 9 disc set can't be beat - every episode with out-takes, info about the cast, its all here! This is one set you'll never get tired of having."
5,"Hours of Hyacinth Bucket, are you ready","My wife and I have always enjoyed the British comedy ""Keeping up Appearances"". Our love of this show has gotten several other friends to also share our love. Hence, we had to buy more because of the ones we had given to our friends to enjoy."
1,Bias,"Bernard Goldberg adds a lot of false claims and a ton of sophistry to reinforce the myth which the Republicans have been busy for years promoting. ie: The right wing corporate media, the very media that is drooling no matter what stupidity is committed by the Bush administration, the media that has persecuted Al Gore, that has been deaf and blind in the face of the Supreme Court biggest crime in History against the Constitution, the madia that spent millions to drool ove Monica and Bill and hides the ENRON-Bush criminal entende...THIS ACCORDING TO THAT HONEST AUTHOR - is a media with a liberal bias. The B..S in his title is the only truth in the Book"
1,THERE IS NO LIBERAL MEDIA REPEAT AFTER ME,"WOW, I AM AN INSECURE WHITE PERSON(OR A ""MODEL MINORITY) WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT ALL THESE LIBERALS CONTROL THE MEDIA WHEN MOST OF THESE CORPARTIONS ARE RUN BY WHITE CONSERVATIVES THEMSELVES. GIVE ME A BREAK NOW GO WATCH ""FAUX NEWS"" AND SOME MORE OF THE LACK OF BRAINS YOU ALREADY HAVE."
1,This book is not worth it at all.,"This is another one of those books written by the right that claims there's a liberal media bias, which is just not true. Bernie distorts alot of facts, including one where he got after the late John Chancellor.Not to mention the fact that on 72 of the book's 232 pages, he cracks his old boss, Dan Rather. It's pathetic, and I would not waste my time on this rubbish like I did."
1,affirming the paranoia of neo-conservative aparatchiks,"Since 1992, American neo-conservatives have been fervently pushing an agenda (some might call it wish-fulfillment) of being persecuted by the godless American Left, capital ""L."" Well, if you fall into the camp of the rabid far-right and seek affirmation of your morally bankrupt fascist world view, by all means pick up a copy. It comes with a free copy Hooked On Phonics, which you'll probably need first."
1,One of the biggest lies told in America today...,"The major media outlets are owned and administered by massive corporations, which are inherently conservative. For these corporations to allow any sort of left-wingery into their media organs would be tantamount to suicide. Of course, they don't stop at simply locking out progressive voices. By loudly perpetuating the myth of a liberal bias, they further strengthen their control over the public. It's a simple string of logic."
2,Boring stuff by a Rush wannabe,"I agreed with some of his points but man this guy can't write. And most of the book is his crying about how CBS mistreated him. Like nothing was ever his fault. Yeah, it was liberal bias against him! Whine, whine, whine. There wasn't enough facts about what's wrong with the media and too much poor me. If you want a good book about media bias just read anything by Rush. This guy isn't the real thing."
1,The Media says there's liberal bias--must be so,"We must believe that liberals control the news media...after all, Rush, Hannity, Coulter, the WSJ, Fox (#1 Rated ""news channel"", Ollie North, Mark Levine, Gordon Liddy, Glenn Beck, the Chicago Tribune, Jonah Goldberg, Charles Krauthammer, and all of Rupert Murdoch's vast right wing media empire tell us it's so."
2,BIAS is biased!,"How the hell can someone try to convince your reader that there is ""male oppression"" in America and turn around in the same chapter and say ""Meredith Vieira of 'The View,' THE ABC GABFEST FOR WOMEN""!?!?!"" Basically, the whole book is to justify his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, which destroyed his career. If you're a democrat/liberal you probably won't like it."
1,Thinly Veiled Personal Rant,"It's clear that Mr. Goldberg is hurt by his personal and professional troubles with CBS and Dan Rather. It is made even clearer by the fact that he constantly brings it up over and over again throughout most of this book.This ""book"", for being written by someone who is outraged over the media bias, is incredibly unprofessional, full of hyperbole, personal rants, and very little decorum. If Goldberg wants to convince us that the media has a liberal slant, he would be much better off keeping his own opinions to himself and write a centered book based on facts. BIAS feels like a personal vendetta against Rather, against CBS, and I suspect that Goldberg had some aspirations for greatness in his return to CBS, was denied, and, in turn, wrote this scathing book as revenge."
1,"No substance whatsoever, don't waste your time!","Mr. Goldberg has some personal issues with CBS, including losing his job. Hardly an objective look at the topic of this book. Don't waste your time reading this one, obviously written because Mr. Goldberg has bills to pay."
2,"Enough with the ""liberal media"" scam",The right-wing establishment has milked this cow dry. [yawn] You want bias? Fox News and its minions should keep you busy for days.
1,"Bias, Indeed","The only people who'll agree that the media still has a liberal bias are the ones who think that TV stations and newspapers owned by Fortune 500 companies are somehow staffed by radical Marxists. Please.The only true thing about this book is its title. Goldberg displays a tremendous bias of his own, and does an excellent job of distorting the news. If you truly think that Fox News is ""fair and balanced"" or that Rush Limbaugh gives reasoned accounts of today's news, then this book is for you. If you have a brain, however, steer clear."
1,Cobblers,"""The code of silence that pervades the news business"" yea right, everyone in the media thinks they have a bestseller as long as they can find a decent hook. That's why juornalistic ethics gets thrown out of the window in potboilers like this."
2,A Real Sleeper,"I heard a lot about this book, so I checked it out of the library to find out what people were talking about. It takes pages and pages of flabby prose for Goldberg to get to the heart of his argument, which is largely anecdotal and mostly unverifiable. Goldberg tells us breathlessly that an unnamed person agrees with him in a two-person meeting that there is ""liberal"" bias in the news. Maybe it happened, but why should anyone believe it? Let's see some proof. Right-leaning reviewers love this book because it bashes ""liberals,"" while left-leaning reviewers dismiss it as exhibiting right-wing bias. A book so devoid of verifiable facts is probably open to this wide range of interpretation. Most readers will find their own prejudices strengthened by Goldberg's vague indictment. This insider's look at CBS News will intrigue readers of People magazine. However, if you are looking for a good read, this isn't it. Goldberg's book is self-indulgent and poorly written."
3,"An easy, somewhat insightful read.","I enjoyed this book, and read it easily in 3 or 4 nights. It offered some new insights into the inner workings of the media and their self-denial of any internal biases. For instance, I felt like I gained some insight into why it is considered acceptable in the media to ""bash"" white males in a way that would be absolutely unacceptable toward a minority. Of course, Bernard Goldberg's media credentials make this book all the more notable and credible. On the downside, despite Mr. Goldberg's protestations to the contrary, I thought he spent too much time beating on Dan Rather. Not that his Dan Rather examples weren't appropriate, but they just got repetitious."
4,Take a pill...,"While an honest expose into the world of broadcast media, _Bias_ is at times vitriolic and inflammatory. It is ironic that Bernard Goldberg expouses objective representation of events, yet his own judgment should be questioned by his own biases. He should take some of the medicine he prescribes.Nonetheless, it is a fine book that media skeptics would enjoy and the naive media-ne'er-do-wrong should be compelled to read."
4,I'm not a reporter like some of the other reviewers,"It's quite apparrent that the media distorts, slants, and adds to their own reporting as being their own ""anonymous source"".We didn't need a book to tell us that, but we now have someone from the ""inside"" to say it's happening. It's about time that someone finally broke ranks and tells the real story about media dishonesty. The media hides behind the first amendment to try to run the country on their terms by using media bias to sway public opinion on subjects from who gets elected president to which laws get passed. The only problem, there is no way to end such bias."
3,All Hype,"Bernie Goldberg's premise is that liberalism is so ingrained into the mass media, that they don't even realize how biased they are -- and I'm inclined to aggree.But most of Goldberg's evidence supports a different theory, that media is biased on purpose.The other problem is that Goldberg is clearly a television writer, not an essayist in print. His prose reads like an over-hyped tabloid TV broadcast, complete with all-too-liberal (pun intended) use of italics and boldface.And some charitable editor really ought to rip the exclamation mark off Bernie's keyboard before he uses it again.What saves this book from a mere two-star rating are some fun (and sometimes blistering) anecdotes, behind the scenes at CBS News.If you want some dish about how TV newsrooms work, then this book has some Drudge-worthy material for you. But it doesn't live up to its title."
2,Hot Air,"The silliest thing about this book, which panders to Rush Limbaugh fans everywhere, is the fact that the so-called issue at stake- ""liberal"" vs. ""conservative"" - doesn't exist. Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush jr. are are all ""neoliberals"", meaning that they favor a laissez faire approach towards corporate capitalism. Goldberg's conspiricy theory that corporations such as CBS, Disney/ABC or General Electric/NBC are somehow fighting against their own hegemony by supporting the left is asinine. Still, if you enjoy oversimplification, or are a libertarian who needs something to read while hiding in your cave until the ""bust cycle"" ends, you may find Golberg's whining entertaining. If you want to read something intelligent about television news, try On Television by Pierre Bordieu instead."
1,"Started at five stars, went downhill from there","Five stars -- because writing -- any writing -- is difficult, and one should always give the writer the benefit of the doubt, and not be judgemental at the start.Four stars -- A incredible amount of bitterness that detracts from what I thought would be an objective analysis of American News Media.Three stars -- the incessent use of italics. It's like being at a cocktail party and having a drunk guy talking to you. You listen, somewhat bemused, but after awhile it becomes incredibly irritating and you just want to smack the guy.Two stars -- Instant realization that I could've bought some music instead of paying twenty odd dollars for this tirade that says nothing new.One star -- my guilt -- at being sucked into the wording of the title, like reading a good National Enquirer headline at the grocery store checkout line -- then feeling like you've been robbed because you actually bought the damn thing."
3,A Hit Piece on Dan Rather,"I just finished this book. Goldberg's indictment of the network news starts out great, with a hard hitting indictment of the network news, and Goldberg's op-ed piece about the bias of a CBS news report.After that it breaks down into generic attacks on the media coverage of issues such as AIDS and homelessness, in which Goldberg makes his point of media bias.The rest is what I consider just filler or hit pieces of Dan Rather. The guy has an obvious axe to grind with Dan, maybe deserved, maybe not, but it's riddled throughout the book."
2,"Potentially good, if it wasn't so biased.","Bernard Goldberg had a great opportunity to write an objective book about media bias toward the left. Instead he chose to use this book as a platform for his personal attacks against Dan Rather and other media elites. In the begining of his book, he compares the media to the mafia and complains that he ""got whacked."" It was difficult to continue the book, but as I plodded through his whine fest, I found that Mr. Goldberg brings up many valid points. Too bad he used a right-wing slant to do so. I for one, like so many people, do not belong to either side of the politics, but prefer information to persuasion."
3,He misses the point...,"Goldberg does well to point out the liberal bias of the news media. Indeed, members of the media are more likely to be of a liberal persuasion than the general population. But the fact of the matter is that educated urban people, who pay attention to the world around them, ie the type of people who make up the news media, are by their very nature likely to be liberal. There is no vast liberal conspiracy behind the scenes. The essence of liberal values is a belief in the freedom of the expression of different ideas. Of course the media, who are engaged in the dissemenination of information as their career, would lean to the left. The real scandal is how conservative our definition of ""liberal"" has become in this country. If Goldberg looked outside this country, he would surely see just how much further the media in Europe goes toward the left."
4,What a breath of fresh air!,"I commend Goldberg for writing this book. It confirms my own observations and worst suspicions, while showing up the big media ""stars"" for the cartoons of journalists they are. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the writing style and lack of documentation: too much repetition and emotion; overuse of italics and exclamation points; no references, footnotes or bibiography to show the dates, times, publications, airings, etc., for his quotes, though no doubt he can back them up. I acknowledge being a staunch conservative but believe Goldberg because he is a journalist first and a liberal second. He's kept his own political persuasions out of his professional work, which is the whole point. Our country is better off for this exposure; The self-serving Dan, Tom and Peter have done us a disservice, damaged news credibility and misled the public. Kudos to Mr. Goldberg's courage!!"
4,Good.,"Good book. Worth reading, if you're interested in insights (and insides) on how the press edits your thought."
5,Terrific book!,Bernard Goldberg's mother and the entire country will proud of him for blowing the whistle on behind-the-scenes bias and peer pressure in the news media. Mr.Goldberg very convincingly makes the point that network PC'ness rules to a depth not known to the American public and for the most part denying the citizens of this country a fair look at the issues. This book should be required reading for anyone who watches network news and talk shows!Nice work Bernie!
5,It is about time,"This book tells it like it is and its about time. Everyone who watches news and news shows (60 minutes, 20/20, etc) should read this book."
5,Couldn't put this one down.,"Kudos to Bernard Goldberg for coming out with this book and exposing those venal, superficial media elitists for what they really are. They are agenda driven fascists masquerading as objective journalists. Their true agenda for America is truly repulsive to contemplate."
4,The messenger's everything here.,"The book, good as it is, could have been written by a number of people, coming as it does from an insider it's all the more difficult for the liberal media elite to dismiss. It's one thing if Ann Coulter, the Wall Street Journal or...is on your case, it's another thing if it's from someone who knows the inside operation."
5,"We Need Solutions, Not Arguments","Whether you like what Bernard Goldberg says in ""Bias"" or not, the book is certainly well written. I'm against all the unconstructive comments by the readers. We need solutions, not arguments. As a journalist, I think the suggestion made by a reader that we look into a kind of self-policing honor system, as described in Norman Thomas Remick's ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson"", is certainly well worth looking into."
1,Liberal Bias? Complete Nonsense...,"Wow..What lies. I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER. The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt. The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others. Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe. Give me a break.This book is 100% lies. I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!"
1,"""Bias"" is biased at all !",It is always interesting that authors who write about bias are the most biased of all.
1,Another Republican Book Telling them HOW and WHAT to believe,"We all know the republican/conservative tactic of telling fellow believers how to think, what to believe,etc. Goldberg does a fine job of this in case you were needing some reassurance. A friend mentioned they saw this book under the arm of our president Bush. Perhaps he too was in need of being convinced that the media is ""liberal."" For those conservatives/republicans that see the truth and realize the media is what it is (unbiased) but do not want to be ousted from their fellow conservatives, this is the book for you. For those republicans that realize that the media is far from liberal and you have independent thought and don't care what fellow conserves think of you, don't waste your time."
2,Now back to reality,The media are only as liberal as the conservative businesses that own them.Any questions?
1,Dan Rather's suits,"How many times does he have to tell us how much Dan Rather spends on his suits? He's just a hacked-off former employee of CBS, grinding away on his axe."
1,How about some cheese with this whine?,"This book is awful. Glad I didn't buy it. Do yourself a favor and get it from the library if you really want to read it. But really, don't waste your time.All this guy does is cater to the Conservative Right and writes about his ""mistreatment"" at CBS.Sounds like a disgruntled employee to me."
1,"Bias, yes. Liberal bias? Well....","There are all kinds of biases in the media, but most bias is in the eye of the beholder. Bias lies not only in how stories are covered, but in the selection process in terms of which stories get covered. Is there liberal bias in the media? Probably, just as there is conservative bias in the media. Does the liberal bias dominate mainstream coverage? Absolutely not, and Mr. Goldberg presents no evidence to support such a claim.What Mr. Goldberg does do is engage in a lot of name-calling, and telling half-truths and unsourced anecdotes. ... But the best evidence of the lack of liberal bias is the widespread publicity and promotion this book has received in the media. Compare that with the virtual absence of publicity for such books as David Brock's ""Blinded by the Right,"" or Greg Palast's ""The Best Democracy Money can Buy."""
1,Like a torque wrench to the brain...,"Bernard Goldberg's Bias is simply a publicized version of his hatred for Dan Rathers and other ""media elites"". I went into this book with an open mind. The first chapter almost induced vomiting. What is Goldberg trying to prove? His thoughts are scatters and unoriginal. It is unclear what his real thoughts are on the ""issue"" at hand. And not once does he mention Fox News. why? Because they have such a heavy conservative bias that they would shatter his blanket statement about liberal bias, which is sickeningly unsupported..."
3,"A compelling premise, but...","Where was the editor when this book was being prepared? Don't publishing houses have professionals around to read these things and make sure that authors don't embarrass themselves by having things like this go into print ""as is""? While I found the author's concept and anecdotal support fairly compelling, I was appalled that someone billed as am Emmy-award winning journalist would have written so sloppy a book. Endless redundancies, ""what-if"" comparisons meant to be cuttingly funny and coming across as low-grade adolescent. I am finishing the book because I do believe it has something important to say, but my advice to the author would be to hire a good editor next time to clean up his prose."
1,Not the Six O'clock News,"What's right with it?The central conceit - that the news is biased.What's wrong with it?It's biased.Unfortunately, Mr Goldberg only presents cases where the bias is to the left, and disregards right-leaning biases. As a result, we are left not with an informative discussion about media bias in America - with examples from both sides - but an ill-researched, immature tome that offers nothing of value to what should be an important, on-going debate."
4,Bias,"In process of reading now,am wellpleased with what has been read,Appears to be very informative.From what has been read appears to be a 4 Star rating."
1,Good title,"Bias is an appropriate title for a book that might also have been appropriately titled ""Axe to Grind."" Poorly written, disjointed, self-important and superficial. Don't wast your money on this hot air."
1,Biased Drivel,"Hmmmm. A book on biased reporting by someone with an overwhelming and obvious bias. With ""Alice in Wonderland"" logic and little factual support, the reader gets the point of this dreary book very quickly. Wouldn't convince a child of the author's point, but might stoke people predisposed to the author's conspiracy views."
2,Too Whiny,"I found this book a little boring. It could have been better, but it seemed like most of it was just Goldberg complaining about his old job. To some degree I think he discredits his own argument because of this. When he finally gets around to making his argument about a liberal bias in the mainstream media he has some convincing points. Some of them are true, others are not. While Goldberg makes a few good points, I don't think his book does a good job of proving his case. The one true bias that any media company will have is a bias for profit, and that means selling the story that people want to hear. Maybe Goldberg's next book will be better."
5,Vindication,"Can you say ""Dan Rather"" or ""Eason Jordan.""The one-star ""reviews"" notwithstanding, Goldberg's book has been proven correct. Rather and Jordan are only the beginning. The worst, most biased, newspaper in the country, The Wasington Post, has 11 ""liberal"" columnists, 4 conservatives. It is, consequently, the worst propaganda disseminator in the country.We need more Bernard Goldberg's to tell the truth."
4,Bias? What Bias.,"I have to admit just seeing this book felt good, and that was before I even picked it up once! Liberal bias in the media is so patently obvious that it's almost unimaginable to me that there is any kind of debate about the topic at all. It's actually amusing to see the number of Media apologists logging on here to ridicule Goldberg's book...Folks! Can you in all sincerity(and with a straight face)actually claim that there is no leftward bias in the mainstream media? If you believe that then you probably also believe that the Israeli's were responsible for September 11(or the Bush administration),that the holocaust didn't happen,that Elvis is alive and well and living happily in Las Vegas and that Aliens ate my Buick! All of the carping about Goldberg's style doesn't change that simple fact and, fortunately the vast majority of Americans DO understand that. Who cares if Goldberg has an axe to grind, the simple exposure of this topic makes this book worth buying and reading!"
5,It only tells the facts that all of have known forever!,"Mr. Goldberg has told it like it is, to the chagrin of most of the left leaning media. From the universities to the major media empires, they have been like an airplane with no left wings and flopping around in their efforts to deny it. I find everything written here to be most probably absoutly true and even forgiving for the transgressors."
4,"Excellent content, so-so style","Regenery publishes a lot of good, hard-hitting books. Unfortunately they are largely long on content but short on style and this book is cast in that mold. No need to rush to judgement; some careful rewriting and thoughtful editing would have made this a 5-star book easily. Fascinating, truthful and devastatingly accurate."
3,Everyone Gets to Write Their Book,"Goldberg goes on and on about the events that led to his dismissal. Yes, it's an interesting story, but c'mon already... The book drags on with the same message: ""There's a liberal bias to the media, and well meaning conservatives will be uncovered unless they toe the company line.""This would have been a better magazine article. Save your money on this one - read it from the library and save your own bookshelf space for something a little more worthwhile.On the plus side, it was an easy read and there were some anecdotes about well-known news personalities - still not enough to justify BUYING it."
2,"""CBS News and I hate each other"" would be a better title","I found this book to be interesting, but Goldberg did not really expose anything to me. The book spent more time about how he had a falling out with Dan Rather, which really doesn't surprise me one bit in the slightest. I'm sure that Rather did everything that Goldberg alledged, but frankly, anybody in a position of power, be it a news organization or any large corporation is not going to take well to someone under them writing such a scathingly critical op-ed. But this book spends more time on that feud then it does trying to prove its point.So in the end, I came out knowing that Peter Jennings is a liberal and the conservatives started watching Fox News instead; which isn't really that different than what I've always known."
5,Biased infotainment product,"The author systematically debunks the media's claims of unbiased reporting. You get an insiders view of how stories and sources are selected in order to send the ""correct"" message, while giving the impression of an impartiality. The author even tackles big media as a business.Some call it spin or even propaganda, the author calls it bias. Whatever it is, it exists.It's a fairly short book that gets right to the points.The only weakness is that Goldberg spends considerable time on his own persecution at the hands of his former colleagues and bosses. On the other hand, these anecdotes provide a chilling reminder to anyone contemplating whistleblowing... You will become the target!"
5,"We already knew the truth,but now we have details","Anyone who has suffered through the patently obvious slanting of the nightly news will only be made more upset by the sordid details chronicled by Goldberg.He goes through the whole liberal elite system and explains the inherent biases that finds its way into our mass media.He exposes the reporting slants on issues like gun control,AIDS,homelessness and a myriad of other causes and propaganda that the media never tires of misrepresenting and championing.Goldberg even digs into the psyche of those who become journalists and finds a pattern:that they don't care so much about reporting the news as it actually is,but about reporting news in a way that they hope will convince the world to see the world as they do.Yes,journalism as religion and holy cause.That is what it amounts to.Very frightening stuff."
4,Raving lunatics,"I enjoyed this book. It was a fast read. Was it shocking? No. Revelational? No. If you've already read ""Slander"" by Anne Coulter or listened to Rush for more than two weeks, there's really nothing here that will change your life.In fact, it's almost better to sit and read the reviews here on Amazon. Holy cow! There are now more than 700 reviews on this books alone. And the tone of the reviews gives you a quick insight into how people (not just the media) view, or perhaps more appropriately filter, bias. These reviews alone would make a fascinating study in American culture."
2,Good content - terrible book,"This book is about how the media distorts the news in order to sell a particular point of view. But the writing is terrible. It is hard to keep the track of the book. The author tries to use metaphors in excess, and instead of a good factual book, you have a book that is a mix of very good content (25% of the book) with narrative in excess that adds zero value to the story.Open the book on any page and read a couple of pages and you will see what I mean. The author uses 3 pages to describe a situation or a fact that can be described with 3 sentences.I am a passionate reader, but I had a hard time finishing this book"
4,"Informative, entertaining read","This book gave me a fresh insight on what I see on News Television every night. It outlines several liberal biases that would otherwise go unnoticed to the untrained eye of the average viewer. Although Goldberg cites that revenge didn't motivate this book, it is rather evident that it was a factor. I recommend this book highly, an eye opener"
5,Goldberg is right on!,"This book was informative reading and the author's criticism of the mainstream media was presented logically, factually, and with a minimal amount of unwarranted emotion. Regardless of your political persuasion, after reading BIAS (if you are honest with yourself) you will agree with the author that our major networks need to take a closer look at fairness in reporting the news - for the sake of every U.S. citizen's best interests."
4,Interesting Read,Very interesting perspective on the prevalent liberal bias in the media from a TRUE insider. More telling is the fact that he admits to agree with the more liberal viewpoint BUT finds it disturbing that it is presented as OBJECTIVE journalism. This conflict is what gave rise to the book.
3,AFFIRMATION AT LAST!,"Bernard Goldberg's new book, Bias, is an affirmation of the ""left slanted"" nature of the media. The realization that there are not only accepted, but actually endorsed policies of favorable bias in the mainstream media toward liberalism, special interests, and the Democratic Party will likely not surprise most readers. The importance of Mr. Goldberg's book may be that a news man, with such a long career, and with the amount of acclaim and respect that the author is afforded, has at last confirmed this bias! In this book, Mr. Goldberg tells all and drops more than a few big names. He insists that his motivation for writing this book is his frustration after years of battling for balanced reporting. One would believe this to be true considering the many bridges that he has surely burned with this publication. This book is worth the read."
1,Don't waste your time,I was very disappointed with this book. I'm an avid Rush Limbaugh listener and I have heard him often describe the liberal bias in the media. I looked forward to this book as an insider account of that bias. It turns out that about 1/2 to 2/3's of this book is a rehashing of an op-ed piece that Goldberg submitted to the WSJ. He spends more space in this book telling the reader why he should be considered a hero for all of the perceived damage he received for writing that piece than he does proving his case.
3,Accurate but bitter..............,"Mr. Goldberg is right, of course. Network news does have a very obvious liberal bias, however, this book was full of bitterness over the shunning he received after his WSJ column. It was almost as though Mr. Goldberg thought that after reading his column Dan the Man would have a personal epiphany, repent of his slanted reporting, change his ways and then thank Bernie for helping him see the light. Since humility is not a character trait that most people care to cultivate, is it reasonable to expect humility and self-examination from a ""media star""? When Mr. Goldberg published his column in WSJ, he should have forseen the response from his colleagues and resigned himself to his fate. Had he done that he could have spent more time in his book documenting liberal bias and less time fuming about the past."
1,Bias and accurate title,"Poorly written and barely researched, this book is designed to reinforce the conventional wisdom of the right wing. The examples are mostly anecdotal and subjective, and often disprove the very argument the author is trying to make.You can find much more evidence that the opposite is, in fact, true. The media is controlled by the right! Look to ... for a broad overview of the theory of right-wing bias or to ... for daily examples of right-wing Bias and decide for yourself. Either of these websites has more hard data than Goldberg's book.As to the spin of this book, It was written to appeal to a right-wing audience. Just look at Amazon's own list of ""Customers who bought titles by Bernard Goldberg also bought titles by these authors"" below. The ""BIAS"" in this case is obvious. If you are one of the sheep Goldberg aims to shear, then by all means buy, Buy, BUY!If you are serious about this topic, look elsewhere."
3,An eye opener,"I feel that Goldberg did well in writing about his concerns and gave some examples of bias in the evening news. Being a ""lefty"" myself I now better understand some of the complaints that I hear from ""righty"" friends. Now I am more aware of what others see as bias.He also went far in describing the behind the scenes Dan Rather. It was more like his contempt for ""The Dan."" I just hoped he would have concentrated on his subject and provided more examples of bias rather than attack an individual.The major drawback to this book was that there were no footnotes. It would be more convincing if a book was meticulously researched rather than gross generalizations and opinions given as facts."
3,Disappointing,"I had hopes that this would be a very interesting book, as insider exposes often are. However, the first half of this book was actually just a rant against the evil CBS that shunned Mr. Goldberg for his editorial on the subject of liberal bias.Once the book starts getting to particulars of the bias, you begin to realize that he's not telling you anything you didn't know. Some of the points are interesting and the scope of the bias is definitely laid bare. However, several of his examples are poorly supported and leave you feeling that he is stretching things to support his case. That he is just trying to fill pages because his argument was already made in the first few chapters of the post-rant portion of the book.I gave this book an extra star, because even though most of us are already aware of the problem, it does a lot when an insider writes it down. The exposure might bring about some change. Here's hoping, but I'm not holding my breath."
3,good for a media insider or media professional,"The first fifty pages were all about office dymanics at CBS, which really did not interest me. The second half of the book is good as the author tackles media bias in homelessness, AIDS, and a variety of other social issues.This book was REALLY hyped by the media, and I think it would be a really cool read for someone in the profession, so I can understand their excitment. But for a soldier, engineer, teacher or someone else the first part just wasn't that interesting."
5,Proven True.,"When I was in college back in the mid-seventies, my English teacher said something that stuck me with, something that has been proven true time and time again, something this book has verified:THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNBIASED MEDIA!!!!"
4,"Excellent At Proving A Problem Exists, But No Real Solution Offered","""Bias"" is an excellent book when it comes to proving there is a bias when it comes to news reporting. Goldberg starts with practical experience, which is shared in the first three chapters. The rest of the book gives proof.Goldberg writes in a friendly, attention getting way. Also, he seems to give credit where it is due, instead of blasting his foes without qualifiers. For example, in a chapter dealing with hate speech (by those in the media), he points out all his examples were in ""editorial"" situations, and not given by someone who is at the time reporting the news.Some books are written to prove there is a problem, while others are written to solve that problem (I won't mention those who try to deny that there is a problem). This book is in the first category. Goldberg effectively proves his point with actual occurances that we still see today. Unfortunately, he offers no suggestions as to solutions."
4,Credibility hurt by Dan Rather bashing.,"Bias is truly a first rate classical muckraking literary example. The case for liberal bias in the various news media is compelling. However, what is more blatant is the omnipotent presence of Dan Rather bashing.Mr. Goldberg's credibility is greatly impeded by references to Dan Rather's personal character flaws; true though they may be. Just as one is getting into the credibility of a well organized and deliberative case being made by the author about liberal bias in the media, a ""Dan Rather is a less than nice person"" example is not so discretely woven into a paragraph. It tended to be so vindictive. In the very early chapters the reader is made well aware of the author's disdain for Mr. Rather. Any further references to Mr. Rather are whipping it to death. This reader found it to be distracting.As a past history/political science teacher, this reviewer still found this book to be provocative. I would look forward to more iconoclast works by Mr. Goldberg."
3,Editorial Opinion or News,"This is a decent short course for anyone who is interested in learning how the ""news business"" operates these days. This book has taken a slam for its ""conservative bias"", so if you are still in doubt about the author's objectivity, I would highly recommend David Halberstam's The Powers That Be. David Halberstam could never be accused of having a politically conservative viewpoint, but he certainly echoes some of the same concerns about ""media slant"" of the news. They agree on one vital fact, there should be a clear cut delineation between news and editorial opinion that business mangement and advertising revenues shouldn't cross.Here's my editorial opinion - it's become increasingly difficult to separate fact from opinion in the so called ""main stream"" media. Goldberg and Halberstam give anyone who isn't interested in being spoon fed a reasonable standard to question what's being presented as news."
3,Take with a grain of salt,"A friend who received an advance copy of this book sent it over to me and asked me to read it and then asked for my opinion afterwards.I try to read things with an open mind but this made me wonder a bit too much. Is Mr. Goldberg upset at CBS? What was his REAL motive for writing this book? How skewed is this book to favor the right-leaning readers? How accurate is this book? The book, albeit very well written, left me with more questions about the writer than it did with the subject he was covering."
1,Crying All The Way To The Bank,"Poor put-upon Mr Goldberg. While arguing that the ""left"" has highjacked the news, he gets on every talk show and forum there is. 1984 anyone?"
1,A Total Hatchet Job,"Published by an organization whose web site boasts being a major publisher of conservative literature, this bitter polemic is the vengeful retribution by a long time CBS ""journalist"" who was essentially forced out by his employer. The fundamental premise (that opinion is too often mingled with reporting) is no surprise and is repeated ad nauseum. The real cause for astonishment is how one, who writes so poorly, could have remained, for so long, as a network correspondent. If you reside on Mars, there may be something to be learned. An insomniac may also benefit."
1,He must be kidding?,"It was impossible to finish this book. All I could see is the grinning face of the author selling snake oil. Corporations own the media. Why would they put a LIBERAL slant on anything? Corporations are notoriously CONSERVATIVE! Anything that the media is selling to the public can only foster CONSERVATIVE interests. If a certain piece appears to be liberal look between the lines at the long-term agenda. Like this book, it is to make the public boo freedom and civil liberties while entrusting our rights to the ""experts."" Nice try Bernard.If you want to know what the media is really doing, read HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD by Joseph Francione"
1,(...),(...) Trying to keep the truth from coming out Bias is a good idea but the truth is all US media is controlled by the right-wing corporate masters. There hasn't been any liberal press for nearly 20 years. Everything that Bernard says is a lie. Although I was forced to giver this piece of trash a single star it really rates a zero star (...)!
1,Poor Widdle Bernie,"This is a book penned by a bitter man. He did not have the career at CBS he thought he should, so he comes up with this. If he was sitting in Dan Rather's seat, do you think this book would have been written? I think the book is a pretty good indicator of exactly WHY Bernie had a mediocre career."
1,Left? Right? UpsideDown?,"Fascinating. Personally, in my observation & opinion I see most of the news media as conservatively biased. So I'm not sure where all the 5 stars for this kind of book are coming from (conservative bleeding hearts maybe?). I prefer independence to specific issues rather than whether or not it fits ""right or left"" bias. Just give me the info & I'll decide for myself. Apparently the motivation for this book is that the average person is not capable of that. If you want to waste your time reading ""biased material"", thats your prerogative. ZERO STARS"
1,I hate fat stupid liberals,"Oh, wait. I thought this was the Michael Moore review section. What I meant was, I love bitter, balding ""journalists"" who use anecdotes rather than facts to make their points.Go, go, Goldberg!!"
1,sell out!,"One needs only to watch FOX news, CBS news, NBC news, or ABC news to see the blatant anti-liberalism in the media. It's plain and simple: the media funds the Republicans and so supports their agenda. Did you see ANYTHING about the half a million anti-Bush demonstrators in London? Not even the NYTimes covered it. Sadly, the only liberalism in the media is by independent progressive papers like the ""progressive populist""."
3,Reviewers are biased,"As a business editor and political centrist, I may be the only reviewer here who knows about the other side of the arguments. If you haven't read Mark Hertsgaard's On Bended Knee, Jody Powell's The Other Side of the Story, or any of the annual lists of ""censored"" stories in the mainstream media, you don't have perspective about distortions by conservatives and an pack mentality that favors credentials over truth-speaking."
1,silly,"A book that demonstrates how easy it really is to lie for money and fame.I mean, if these sort of books were television shows, Anne Coulter's ""Slander"" would be Survivor, and ""Bias"" would be the Sci-Fi channel's house with eight spooky-cooky people.Poorly researched. Poorly written. But above all, actually managing to prove his point simply by existing as a lying journalist."
1,THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE,"The title of this book should've been titled ""WHY I HATE DAN RATHER AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE PRESS"". I couldn't wait to read this book but DO NOT waste your money. This is a book about a man who has personal problems with specific news correspondents and he's just venting in a book. He boohoos about how Dan Rather gets great treatment and such. All the personal attacks made it hard for me to believe that he is credible and intelligent. Instead, he sounded utterly hateful and childish. I got the feeling that he doesn't truly care about the biased media but the purpose of his book is to vent."
1,Typical right wing rhetoric...,"They say that the pendulum always swings as far to the right as it does to the left. After 8 years of peace and a booming economy, alas, we are now again under ""right wing rule"". How quickly the American public forgets the prosperity enjoyed over the last few years and this short-sightedness is reflected in this pro right book. It is nothing but finger pointing, blame placing nonsense that should be saved for the school playground. Save your money on this book and deposit it into your savings account. You will need the money much more than Mr. Goldberg when the next Republican inflicted recession hits."
2,Goldberg forgets his own bias,"This book is about bias. In this case it's about Goldberg's bias after leaving CBS. This is a 'preaching to the choir' book. If you are conservative, you'll love this screed, if you are middle of the road to liberal you will be offended as the author intends. When liberal politics makes a comeback, expect Goldberg to flip flop once again and return to expousing liberal politics as he has for the majority of his career."
1,"Poor Bernie fell off the gravy train, and it hurts!","What nonsense! Bernie Goldberg rode the gravy train and enjoyed his limelight for decades. It didn't occur to him to complain then.Now that he's lost his job and has an axe to grind, he's moaning and groaning. That's double standards, Bernie!This writer still believes the news media is a lot more credible than most politicians, liberals or, especially, conservative, because the latter are usually in the pockets of the rich and powerful.Goldberg fell out with his colleagues as well as his employers and, regardless of who was at fault (and, reading his book, one would have to think that everyone else was), he should accept his consequences."
4,Not Just Sour Grapes,"Goldberg brings to light the fact that the talking heads at the major networks do not even realize what they're doing. They have been conditioned themselves to believe that the country feels the same way they do about social and political policies. That's how out of touch they are, with their six figure salaries and their fancy brunches on the upper East side of Manhattan. ""Forgive them - for they know not what they do."""
4,A Must-Read Book,"Everyone should read this book...Conservatives because it will bear out all you have been thinking and believing about the media...Liberals because you will learn something about the newsreaders you may admire and media sources you may believe. It's well-written, and easy to read and understand. I find it interesting that Mr. Goldberg, who says he has never voted Republican, can still look at the issues so objectively. he is right on the mark about the homeless and aids and how they have been used as propaganda by the mainstream media. My one complaint, which is why I give it only 4 stars instead of 5, is that there is no index...I consider that to be needed in any non-fiction book, particularly one that names names, networks and print media as this one does....Bernie gets 5 stars, but the book gets only 4."
4,Bias Exposed,"Lays out the facts about bias in the media with specific names and examples. Good read for open minded individuals. If you want facts to form your own conclusion, they are in this book. Don't be influenced by reviewers who want to debate the issue while ignoring the specific examples Goldberg presents."
5,Slanted Journalism----The Battle for your Mind & Pocketbook,"Over 30 years ago, an uncle of mine told me of the inherent bias in network news. But I never knew what to look for until I read Bernard Goldberg's BIAS. At great personal sacrifice to his family and his career, he courageously explains why he went public, starting with a Feb. 13, 1996 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, about the inherent liberal bias in network news shows. He cites detailed examples; he names names; and he gives reasons why it is being done. More importantly, he will put into your hands and your mindset the tools with which you can analyze the news and the news media so that you can arrive at some semblance of undistorted news. He will also reveal why you see certain types of television shows but not others."
3,Bias is unaviodable,"Conservatives will praise this book for validating their opinion they are under attack by the ""media"". Liberals will condemn it for its view that they control the news. Does anyone actually believe that news can really be objective in 10 second sound bites? Perhaps there is a greater problem with Americans lack of commitment to learning about issues in depth and expecting the media to explain it all for them. News is a business and in a market system you get what you pay for, isn't that the American way? To paraphrase just a little, you get the news you deserve, so stop whining."
3,"Although Good Points, Pretty Self-indulgent","Goldberg does point out interesting issues in the media that are bias, but he uses such immature name calling and analogies that it makes this book hard to take seriously. Most of the evidence are completely anecdotal, which lack credibility, although there are some parts in the book that uses some good statistical evidence.I would suggest ""Media Monopoly"" by Ben Bandikian. Although it is rather dry, I feel like this shows the source of biasness in the media better."
1,"Should be called, why Bernard thinks he is so great.","I went into this book with an open mink, looking forward to hearing an argument for a point of view opposite of my own. But all I got was a whiny old man, who is mad that he got fired. The entire book is written on about 3 ... examples. Bernard Shaw is either really stupid, or really sheltered. He takes on a constant me againstthem stance, and all you read about is how wrong and evil everyone else is, and how saintly and noble Bernard is. I am so upset that I spent time and money on this book. Please don't make the same mistake. Bernard, if you read this, get over it, dude. Just let it go. And open your eyes, my friend. You have no idea what you're talking about."
4,bias,"I consider myself a moderate with more agreement with liberal philosophy. I think the book is right on target, but who cares ,because liberals are usually the more correct.I do believe the news might be less obviously liberal leaning but as long as I agree it's OK! Chuck Hird"
2,"Goldberg is ""Bias""ed","As a moderate Democrat I feel it is important to hear and consider other points of view. It was somewhat of a revelation to me to learn that the major networks may lean to the left in their reporting of the news. It was, however, very painful to endure Mr. Goldberg's relentless right-wing rhetoric. He uses all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in displaying his own bias. I think this seriously detracts from what could have been a groundbreaking book."
4,Book Confirms Media Criticism,"In Bias, Bernard Goldberg, ex-CBS News reporter confirms the feelings held by millions of news watchers: that news stories slant to the Left and give conservative ideas short shrift. The bias comes from reporters' cultural isolasion and elitism. It also comes from a strange perception of the world. Dan Rather thinks the NY Times editorial page is ""middle of the road."" After reading Goldberg's story, I see little hope of the media reforming itself. The institituion cannot handle criticism. The biggest weakness with the book is Goldberg's angry tone. He was unjustly pushed aside at CBS News over a Wall Street Journal op-ed, but the bitterness gets tiring."
1,Goldberg is full of anger and bias,"I am listening to the book on tape, so I hear the anger in his voice. As other reviewers commented, he seems to be trying to get even with Dan Rather and others. His evidence is weak and he goes off on personal tangents.His idea of the ""big story"" that doesn't get printed is ""working Moms are causing problems for their children."" He refered to ""unattended children"" as ones that were left with step parents and molested by the non-biological parent and somehow this is the fault of the ""working Mom."""
1,Please!,"Having taught US history for forty years, I submit that any liberal bias that may have been reflected in the media, has been so diluted due to increased corporate ownership and control of the media that it can barely raise its intellectual head. Even National Public Radio has moved to the political right due to its increased dependence on corporate supporters; a trend that began as the Federal Government began to reduce public funding during the Reagan years.If, as Mr. Goldberg asserts, the media is liberal now, I shutter to think what we will see and hear when he has become satisfied that it has become appropriately conservative. I can only visualize a fascist state. Sinclaire Lewis wrote a novel entitled It Can't Happen Here? When I read it as a boy, I believed it. Fifty years later, I fear that it can and, alas, is."
1,Not a true Republican!,"Bernard Goldberg makes about as much sense as Sean Hannity. If you want to read a book by a disgruntled ex-employee, a book that will satisfy your heavy right-wing conservative convictions; this is the book for you. Two of the three largest networks on cable are owned and run by Republican conservatives -Fox News Channel, MSnbc.The type face in the book is large. He has no structure with his argument. The criticism of John McCain, JFK, Howard Zinn, Ralph Nader, the film ""The Big One"", Bill Moyers come up often in the book.In one part he tells people to go to there local book store and rip the covers off Ralph Nader's book ""Crashing the Party"".Not worth your time."
2,"""Bias"" or ""Dan Rather, what a jerk""","An easy read about why Goldberg hates Dan Rather. Really, using only one example, Mr. Goldberg tells us about apparent liberal bias in the (pre 9/11) media. Unknowingly, he paints an excellent picture of CORPORATE bias in the media. The books 'purpose seems to be getting back at Rather for a couple of years of tension between the two men. Seems kind of stupid now"
2,Could have been a New Yorker article . . .,"had brevity been his strength. Except the New Yorker editors might have required a little more of Mr. Goldberg than his editors here required. Tempest in a teapot. ""How to turn an anecdote from your life into a cash stream"" should be the subtitle."
1,This book is a joke,"I can summarize my opinion in few words...""Best defense is a good offense "".The author is criticizing how biased the media is while himself is writing biased and distorted facts in his book !"
2,"what does ""liberal"" mean anyway?","It's incredible that right-wingers can still whine aboutthe ""liberal"" media, absolutely breath-takinglyincredible. The media are ferociously andaggressively middle-of-the-road status quo,which is by its very definition a conservativeposition. Think about it: how long wouldcorporate America continue to foot the bill ifthe media were critical of them in any seriousway? Get real. A truly liberal media wouldhave already made our president-by-coupthe laughingstock that he is in the rest ofthe world, like shooting fish in a barrel.Or, by the word ""liberal"", did you mean""smug, venal, and xenophobic"" ?Well, in that case..."
1,Is he credible?,"Before you purchase this book consider this. On the Sean Hannity radio talk show, Goldberg said FOXNEWS is NOT biased, unlike the other major networks that are. If you think that is a credible statement, I'm sure you'll think his book is credible."
1,what a waste!,"I can't believe that after 20 years as a ""journalist"" all Goldberg managed to come up with is this shallow little volume. This book doesn't illuminate anything that we can't see with our own eyes. Further, its simply a self-aggrandizing tome by some self-righteous guy who uses the exact inflamatory, non-journalistic weasels he accuses everyone else of using. This isn't journalism, it's a very lame biography about some guy without much skills as a journalist, writer or whistle-blower. But he does have an agenda."
2,Hot Air,"The silliest thing about this book, which panders to Rush Limbaugh fans everywhere, is the fact that the so-called issue at stake- ""liberal"" vs. ""conservative"" - doesn't exist. Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush jr. are are all ""neoliberals"", meaning that they favor a laissez faire approach towards corporate capitalism. Goldberg's conspiricy theory that corporations such as CBS, Disney/ABC or General Electric/NBC are somehow fighting against their own hegemony by supporting the left is asinine. Still, if you enjoy oversimplification, or are a libertarian who needs something to read while hiding in your cave until the ""bust cycle"" ends, you may find Golberg's whining entertaining."
4,Buy it and pass it around,"Nothing in this book was a revelation to me. I stopped watching network news years ago for no other reason that it made my blood pressure to high. This book however does a great job of detailing not only just how pervasive the problem of liberal bias in the news is, but also tries to explain how it got that way.The first 50 or so pages could use a good housecleaning. I was starting to wonder if it would turn around when about page 55 it went straight into the meat and potatoes. Lots of examples of the liberal slant on:HomelessnessAidsMan BashingTerrorismAlas there is nothing on gun control, can't have it all I guess.Bottom line:Buy this book even if you already believe the media is biased. Read it to prove to yourself that you are not crazy, then start passing it around your less elightened friends."
5,Fantastic Book - Highly recommended,"It's about time that somebody dispels the erroneus concept that everything told on the news is gospel truth and carved in stone.Dan Rathers slip of the tongue that ""we are losing the election"", referring to the fact that Bush had beaten Gore is one example.The number of Americans that erroneoously believe that Gore should have won indicates how powerful this biased reporting is.Cheers to Bernard Goldberg for having the fortitude to tell it like it really is. Great book. This is a must read."
2,Missed Opportunity,"He'd right. He's wrong. He'd hopelessly muddled. Bernard Goldberg undermines his credentials as a journalist by writing a poorly researched and documented litany of complaints. (My bias: I am member of the media who agrees with his basic premise). He blasts ""The Media"" for not covering certain stories, and then uses the New York Times and Washtington Post as references for the stories being ignored. He argues blacks have too much influence with the networks and devotes an entire chapter to how blacks have little real representation on network television. It all comes across as rantings from a bitter man who got fired. That is unfortunate. The book is a missed opportunity."
4,Only one observation missing:,"In the chapter entitled ""The Most Important Story You Never Saw on TV"" concerning mothers who stay at home and raise their children, the only thing Mr. Goldberg missed is the fact that conservatives believe this is a job to be praised. Should the liberal media take that same stand, they would be for family values and that has become a ""right-wing"" cause."
4,The truth is finally told...,It all makes sense - Goldberg tells some fascinating stories of the behind the scenes goings-on in network news. Thank God for the Fox News Channel...
5,Blather Exposed!!!!,This book reinforces what many people have known for years! The Big 3 have had almost 50 years to brainwash the public with their liberal bias. Now with radio talk shows and other cable outlets we can get the other side. Just think what politicians et.al. have been allowed to get away with in the past because of media protectionism. Damm Blather is the worst of the Big 3 and he's not ashamed of it - He even thinks Clinton is an honest man!! Give me a break! Bernie Goldberg should get the Pulitzer Prize just for his courage in exposing the TRUTH!
2,Doesn't Regnery Employ Editors?,"Bernard Goldberg has written a bad book about an interesting and important topic. It reads like something that was rushed to print and completely unedited. I agree with his premise that the newsroom has become so insular there's no reason to assume that journalists understand how biased they've become. Unfortunately his hyperbolic style, obvious personal grudges, sloppy writing, and lack of coherent structure weaken his case. The messenger almost killed the message."
2,"Adios, Dan!","I finished this book and fired off an email to Dan Rather, entitled ""Adios, Dan."" It read to me like Goldberg was angry; but who wouldn't be? He is known to be a liberal, had to have been a team player, and still was let go from the ""good ol' boys' club."" My disappointment was that it read a little like the check-out stand tabloids. Content was titilating in the table of contents and failed to deliver much substance in the actual chapter.I experienced this same disappointment with Leslie Stahl's autobiography in that it seemed to neutralize content that could have been gossip-column juicy and expository.I imagine with fingers to point and names to name, books like this have to walk a fine line between commentary and libel.It made me intensely dislike a grudge-holding Dan Rather, who has lost the courage and passion of intensely personal reporting, qualities that made him an urban legend during his coverage of the Nixon White House."
3,a review from a non-partisan reader,"I had to read this and Al Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them for a class. As far as using anecdotes to get his message across, Goldberg does a good job. The problem that I had with this book is that in his attempt to be critical of the ""liberal bias"" that he claims exists in the media, Goldberg comes across as self-righteous, and just as arrogant as the journalists he is criticizing. I had a difficult time reading this because I 1) do not identify as either liberal or conservative, and 2) read Franken's book first (in which Goldberg's information-gathering process is ripped nearly to shreds). My very Republican friend read through Bias in a day. I urge everyone to read this book for themselves, watch and read the news on their own, and come to their own conclusions."
5,COURAGEOUS AND RIGHT-ON!,"Finally, someone from within that ""News-a-tainment"" monolith has the courage to tell it like it is... Gunga-Dan and company are a bunch of rich lefties, blinded by their own limited brain cells.Check out another great, light-hearted read... Keshner's ""COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT,"" my vote for book of the year.My complements to both Messrs. Goldberg and Keshner,Oliver North"
5,What we already knew,"Even my liberal friends knew that the news was biased and sort of smirked about it. The smirks are now gone since Fox news came on the scene and even MSNBC has attempted to give both sides with some of their new shows.I think that the balance is getting there but not yet arrived completely. Now we need an expose of NPR, etc."
4,Solid Read,"A good read. Perhaps a little unobjective at parts, but informative nevertheless. As with everything else, it should be taken with a great of salt...but Goldberg does present a fair amount of evidence to substantiate his argument (you simply have to read the entire thing). For many he's simply stating the obvious, but he does add some fairly insightful critique.As a sidenote, don't listen to the apparently numerous Chomsky-ites...they most likely didn't *read* the book. Anyone who tells you the media and corporations are in the same bed has a severe disconnect with reality (1 word...Firestone), so you can pretty much disregard their opinions."
1,Garbage,"This book is ridiculous. Yes, there are some liberals in the media, and once in a while they might make a questionable decision because they are biased. But there are plenty of conservatives in the media as well; in fact, the media is largely owned by large corporations and rich right-wing individuals (e.g., Rupert Murdoch). Goldberg spends about a third of the book complaining about how he was unfairly canned from CBS and explaining his hatred for Dan Rather. Who cares?By the way, an independent check on several of the news stories that Goldberg cites in this book indicate that he is not entirely on the level. But maybe I just read that in the biased, liberal media."
4,Fun and enlightening read.,"Well, now that you can get a used copy of this book for the price of a latte, why not get it? An insider blows the whistle on CBS news! I can't really write anything that hasn't already been written, but I can say that I sure enjoyed this book.This book's one downfall to me is that it comes across as one long rant, but maybe Mr. Goldberg deserves to rant a bit after what he's been through."
3,early 20th century voice,"Johnston was very popular early in the 20th century. I read her ""To Have and To Hold"" as a teenager... and it was old then. However ""Prisoners of Hope"" was a new read for me. I enjoyed it very much. If you enjoy flowery but beautifully written descriptions that easily evoke an early Virginia geographical setting and if you enjoy historical persons taking a role in fiction, then you will enjoy this story. The protagonist is believeable as an injured dissenter sent from England to toil on a Virginia plantation as punishment for his religious and anti-government activities. The difficulties, espionage, and adventures that he gets embroils in are worthy of his fine character and heroism. Encounters with rebelling Indians, various indentured servants, and slaves fit the time period and the story. The style is definitely dated but the story, history, and even the descriptions of Virginia are worth your time. But you must be patient."
1,akai and service net,I bought this tv in april 07. The sound started to go garbled in 4 months. Contacted manufacturer to find only 3 month warranty. I did buy a service contract from SERVICE NET when I bought tv. They had someone pick up the tv and diagnose the problem. $500 to repair. When I tried to get my purchase price refunded from SERVICE NET they told me I had to pay $130 for pick up and diagnostic. My advice to you is stay away from this tv and the thieves at SERVICE NET.
2,disappointed,"I was looking for music that will help my students learn the sounds of the alphabet but to my disappointment there was none included in the album. Anyway, I said it was ok cause because it teaches about other things too like shapes, letters etc. But I was just not inspired by the music. It was not as lively as I expected and it sounded like country music to me. I know the type of songs that will really get my kids excited and this is just not it."
4,Excellent Product,"Appears to be an excellent product. Recently took golf trip with my son. He used this case and I used a new Datrek ""Blue Whale"" hard case. No comparsion, to our destination the ""Blue Whales"" locks came open, the SKB was secure. On the way home, the SKB was terrific, the ""Blue Whale"" sunk, with a lock totally breaking. I think I'll harpoon the ""Blue Whale"" and definitely buy another SKB!"
3,expected better for the price,Love the hard case and the latches with TSA lock. Was dissapointed with the size and the quality of construction. It doesn't seem like it is going to last very long. The logo plate on the front is aready peeling off and I've only used once. It should get the job done for a few years but just expected better quality for the price.
4,Golf Travel Case,"This travel case is well made, has rollers to help you through the airport, and has an approved lock to help you through baggage security. if you have a large golf bag, it may not fit. The only negative for me is the weight. Nonetheless, it's well worth the investment."
5,ATA Deluxe Golf Travel Case,I received my ATA Deluxe Golf Travel Case on time and exactly as advertised. I'm very satisfied with how this particular purchase worked using Amazon.
1,broke after one use,"I bought this bag because I started taking several golf vacations a year and wanted to start shipping my clubs rather than lug them to the airport. The first time I shipped this bag, my clubs were temporarily lost because the handle used when rolling the cart was ripped off. The packing info had been attached to the handle and was lost in shipping. What a nightmare. Based on the reviews, I decided to purchase this particular travel bag. It may have been a fluke, but beware....the handle is obviously not durable enough to handle long distance shipping."
4,"Great, but ...","The case locks are, indeed, TSA approved, the case seems pretty indestructible, as do the locks but . . . My son has a Nike Xtreme element bag, which has a rigid, handle at the top. This makes the bag not only 14 inches at the base but 14 inches at the bottom. While this product is sold as a 4814--i.e., 48 inches long and 14 inches wide, it is definitely NOT 14 inches its entire length. I cannot close the case entirely without forcing it closed, which means putting enough pressure on the bag's semi-flexible aluminum tube (which runs up its side and gives it rigidity) that I was able to close the case. Now, I have to hope that forcing the bag like this won't damage the bag in the long run during flights, because I didn't have sufficient time to send it back before we needed the case. Ugh. Please, more accurate description in model specifications!"
2,Way too small for standard CART bag,"I read all the review before ordering. All I can say is most of these folks must have some really, really small cart bags. I tried my wife's bag, my bag, an old and very small cart bag I had. I could not even get them in with every pocket empty. Only our lightweight stand bag would fit. I have two SKB bags that are a hard top with soft bottom that I have been using for years that hold our bags easily. SKB quality is tops though."
3,Falling apart and terrible customer service,When I first received the case it looked like it has great build quality. Now after only two trips it's coming apart at the seams. Have tried to call customer service a number of times and keep getting voicemail and no call backs. So much for the lifetime warrenty. Would not recommend this product.UPDATE: finally got a customer service response via their website. I will provide another update when I see how the return process goes.UPDATE #2: received replacment case. Will report back after next tripUPDATE #3: two trips in the books and so far so good. Really like the design of the locks. Upgrading rating from 1 star to 3. Will go to 4 star if it continues to hold up over the next year - we have at least 2 more trips planned for this summer.
4,Great protection but a little small,Great protection but little room for anything else. The bag will take care of your clubs but a little more room would be helpful.
1,Pretty Bad Tasting Chips,After seeing the reviews I thought these were good Chips. The Chips are Flavored too much. Stick to Good chips like Terra.
2,Not as represented by the picture!,"I ordered this axle shaft rather than buying locally because it is shown with wheel studs and ABS ring installed. This is not what I received. Instead, I got a bare axle shaft and will have to try to remove these from the old axle and install them on the new shaft.If I can't get them off I'll wind up paying a machine shop to do it. Not much of a bargain after all."
3,unusual collector's item,"Very stylishly packaged reprint, but the magazine's primary purpose was the sale of physique photo sets, and as such there isn't much in the way of editorial. Chiefly of historical and nostalgic interest, although leafing through it I was amused to chart the progress of one Richard du Bois, former Mr America and later minister of the cloth; a cute capsule history."
3,Reasonable Good,"These chisels are reasonably good and fairly sharp as received. I was slightly disappointed with the overall finish as the chisel needed substantial honing to remove the grinding marks from the business end. Once the chisel was honed, slight touchup with a diamond cone on the inside of the chisel and some slight sharpening of the auger, it was ready for use. Once 'tuned up' the chisel works very well, I cut over 100 mortises in hard maple and it is still going strong."
2,not so great,"Eh, another you get what you pay for. Morticing bits can easily go $150, this was what, $20. So yeah I cheaped out on it. The steel is really soft . Dulls easily, but sharpens easily as well so that's a plus. I have a Powermatic Morticer and it does not fit the bushings as snggly as the Jet and Poermatic bits, go figure they are the same manufacturer..... I did not feel the CMT cleared chips as well either. I hear Lee Valley has some nice bit inexpensively I will try prior to sinking the big buck."
5,Power Pop Peak,"The Shoes were one of the great Power Pop acts in the late 70s/early 80s. They had every right to be as popular as Cheap Trick, the Cars, et al, but somehow they never scored any hits. These 30 tracks are demos of the songs that would appear on the Shoes two masterpiece albums, Present Tense and Tongue Twister. The melodies are sweet but with just enough of an edge to them - same with the music. It's like Cheap Trick but more introspective, the Cars but not as slick - four shy and nondescript guys from the Midwest who had a love of melodic music and a knack for creating great pop songs. The songs make me feel like I'm at the roller rink on a Friday night, slow dancing with me new girl, both of us with feathered hair and me with a comb in my back pocket. But this is not novelty music; it is some of the best power pop you'll ever hear, and these demos are a little rawer (and thus maybe more interesting) than the officially-released versions of the songs."
4,Fascinating concept,I totally enjoyed reading about a time period when I was raising my own family. I have read other books by Barbara Wood and always look forward to them. However the ending left me wanting just a bit more!
3,Picture is larger then it may appear.,"After our dog ate my mothers day bracelet, my husband offered to replace it. I decided to go simpler and choose this braclet.Now keep in mind that most of the jewelry pictures is no where near as large as it is pictures. This bracelet is delicate and rather light. The toggle clasp is not the best, as it fell off of my wrist several times. I had to take it to the jeweler to have a lobster claw clasp put on in it's place.I can't complain- it is a pretty, simple bracelet. But the clasp is just terrible."
3,Only for babies up to 14 weeks,"Bought this product when my baby was 13 weeks old, as the product information said ""one size fits all"" with no further info. When it arrived and after paying more for expedited shipping, I was extremely disappointed to see that the packaging said only to use it on babies up to 14 weeks! This should be clearly stated in the product description."
4,they are a miracle,"A friend recommended this blanket to me before my baby was born. I didn't use them right away. One day I remembered I had them and started to use them. They are awesome. I don't swaddle my baby the exact way as the instruction suggest, I modified it a little and it works great. If she is not swaddled, she doesn't sleep for a long time, she wakes up with her own movements. She is now two months.I enjoy this product."
3,A good starting spot but there are better ones out there,This book gives a good introduction to clep and college credit exams. I just finished my degree and have earned over 80 credits using exams. Another recommended resource is at [...]as it outlines everything you will need with several complete study guides.
3,Clep Review,It provided some information concerning an exam I wanted to take. More examples would have been useful
5,Slappin,"This album slaps. This is part II, and if you can find it, get part I. Part I is one of my fav albums of all time."
4,Buyer Beware: Compilation Album!!,"Two of the tracks are from ""Animal Crackers in My Soup,"" the rest are from ""On the Sunny Side"" and ""Swingin' in the Rain.""It pays to have a sharp eye since some of the song titles are shortened on this compilation disc.If you have none of the above three discs, this is a wonderful compilation disc.There is absolutely nothing wrong with compilation discs.But completists should know up front this album has no previously unreleased tracks, something the item description *could* have mentioned?"
4,Not as good as it should be,"I've used Visual Quickstart books for years, and until this one they've been extremely accurate. This one contains what seem to be screen caps of menus and options from some previous version of InDesign, so you have to look around for the options someplace else if they've moved.That said, it's a good book overall and the ""Tips"" are a valuable part of understanding how InDesign functionality works."
4,Fine for the novice,"Having newly come from Microsoft Publisher, In Design was a challenge. I used the Adobe manual in parallel with this one, got more out of the combination than the sum of each one by itself. Managed to produce a design in three weeks from start to finish. Friends who know the business find that a remarkably short time."
1,Absolutely dreadful.,"Once again, the author drags us on a predictable, trite, poorly-written ""adventure"". I cannot urge potential readers enough, do not waste your time or money on these books! It's pretty obvious that the author writes all of the five star reviews, heh."
1,Disappointing,"Based on the reviews, I was really surprised by the lack of quality in this book. It's extremely difficult to read as there as so many problems with the writing and the story is full of holes. I've read cereal boxes that were more interesting. Definitely not recommended."
3,"Mildly entertaining, badly written...","The book was entertaining overall, but the grammar was atrocious and many a time the characters would say phrases that don't make sense in that world, for example they would say ""Damn,"" which doesn't make sense because Damn originated because of the Christian religion which doesn't make sense in a world were it doesn't exist. But, overall I would say it's worth reading, though not worth it's price."
3,A story that has my interest,"This second book is written at a much slower pace than the first one, yet, I still found it interesting enough to read and hard to put down. I liked that Brian Pratt introduced more characters to the story but I don't like that he was pulled onto a rabbit trail, leading him away from his main quest to rescue a friend. I am hooked on this story and will be finishing the series because I like the main character James and have been pulled into his story. I can't wait to see more magic from him in the future books. Brian Pratt is a talented writer and story teller and I'm a fan for sure. Can't wait to read more of his stories after finishing this series."
2,Written for younger audience,"The storyline is decent enough, but I couldn't get into this book. It is written to tell a story rather than to make the reader see or feel the story. The grammar and sentence structures were ungainly where they weren't downright wrong.While I didn't care for it, I could see younger readers (about ages 11-14) enjoying this book. The story is something that I think would appeal to kids in middle school- it certainly would have caught my interest, and my nephew seems to enjoy it well enough."
2,Not that impressed...,"IDK bought b/c I was Hoping that some how the character development and storyline would get better with the second. Not that impressed. Plus it's really short, paid money for a quarter of a story.Wont be finishing the series"
3,Entire series,"After reading the entire series, I would say that it was both enjoyable and lacking in substance. The series felt like it was written for a younger reader. (Maybe it was.) The first book left a lot to be desired and I almost didn't buy the next one. The rest of the series flowed fairly well. The biggest complaint I have is the dialog between the characters. It didn't feel or sound like two people talking in a real life context. The last book, ""Mists of Sorrows"" ended much too quickly, almost like Pratt was missing a deadline. Overall, I would rate it middle of the road, not poor nor great."
3,An easily forgettable book,"I thought this was going to be a good book about Vietnam, but, now that I've read it, I can see that my hopes were too high. Did you ever read the beginning of a book and think to yourself, ""it'll get going here shortly...""? Usually, when I feel that way, I read a respectable portion of the book and then decide whether to finish it or drop it. With this book, since it was so short, I finished it, but never stopped wondering when it would get going.I think the author needed to either write a longer book and better develop the characters and story or pare his effort down to a smaller focus on maybe one character. As it is, he produced a not very well developed story populated by not very well developed characters. A formula for a forgettable book, in my opinion. I've read a number of excellent books about Vietnam, but I can't say I'd rate this as one of them. I really can't recommend it."
3,Snap On,Nice Book but was looking for more snap on die cast items to use a a reference. Didn't contain much.
1,Don't Bother,"I don't understand all the great reviews for this movie. About the only thing I can praise is the cinematography, which is so outstanding it even shines through on an old VHS tape. Few movies have ever brought bayou scenery to life like this.If I ever watch it again, however, I'll do so with the volume off! The movie is inane, insulting, and cliched. As a LA native myself, I don't see how anyone can call this film ""realistic"". Come on! The inbred, mentally-challenged brother? The sexy teen itching to stir up trouble? The nutty bayou widow with the bad fake teeth? The brother who stays permanently locked in the shed? The poor whiny wife whose husband rules with an iron fist? The fish-out-of-water visitors who shine a light on this whole swampy dysfunctional clan??? About the only cliche this movie lacked was a deadly alligator scene.Too bad an alligator didn't eat the script."
1,Boring to the extreme,"It gives a dark feeling of a typical Soviet movie. Two hours of no chemistry, no actions, no romance and no nothing. They probably wanted to show us several deep physiological characters under the microscope in a very substandard manner. But who want to see them? This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen."
3,uneven,"The first half of this book is interesting. It reveals the history of ESPN and is well written. The second half of the book is an amalgam of gossippy information about the internal organization that is ESPN. It may be interesting for some to read about personality tension, the plight of low level employees, and sexual harassment at ESPN. Yet, unfortunately, personality tensions, bad conditions for workers, abuse of power and sexual harassment are characteristic of many organizations. Abuse of power and sexual harassment needs to be discussed no matter where it prevails. However, I thought much of the second half of the book was a thatched collection of episodes that may have been ""uncensored"" but did not contribute to a unique history of ESPN. Therefore, I think the title of the book is misleading and thematically, after the first section, the book loses its ostensible focus."
4,Author should be less opinonated,"While the book does a great job of showing the behind the scenes action at ESPN, the writer should heed the lessons of the personalities he writes about. He suggests that many of the anchors and producers are too egotistical, yet at the same time he STATES without any objectivity that Andrea Kremer is the best reporter and that Keith Olbermann is ""the best talent in the two-decade history of 'SportsCenter'."" While I have no problem with voicing one's opinion, to claim that Olbermann, who was disliked by so many for his smug attitude and sophomoric antics and who later got a dose or reality after he thought he could succeed at MSNBC, was the absolute, no-contest best talent is obsurd to say the least. Tell us the stories, leave the opinions to the readers."
3,It's a History of a Dysfunctional Work Place,"When Keith Olbermann is the most well-behaved employee, you might have a problem. And did ESPN ever have problems in the 1980s and 1990s. This book goes into the sordid details of lurid parties, awful sexual harassment and a power structure at the network that didn't care...and apparently still doesn't care because Mike Terico is still on the air.If you're looking for a case study on awful organizational culture, poor management techniques, improper HR procedures, and how much that will cost a company in the long run, this is your book.If you're looking for a fun, light read, this isn't your book because so many of the incidents are disgusting and revolting.That said, it is well written and well reported. And if you're an MBA student, it's worth the read. Hint: don't follow the ESPN model."
3,Not What I expected,"If you want a complete guide to ESPN's history, this book will satisfy for the most part, but it wasn't exactly what you would expect. If you are looking for a book that is more self serving for the likes of Keith Olbermann, than this is definitely that. It takes more of Olbermann's view than any other at the network, and almost seems like a public forum for the former Big Show Co-host. Not bad, but not 5 stars..."
5,Strongly recommended reading for all sports buffs,"ESPN: The Uncensored History by sports journalist Michael Freeman is an eye-opening, bare-all look at the global telecommunications network that since its inception in 1979 as the ""Entertainment and Sports Programming Network"", has gone on to become virtually synonymous with televised sports. From its relatively humble origins, ESPN has gone on to expand into additional offerings for the dedicated sports enthusiast including ESPN2, ESPN Classic Sports, ESPNews, and ESPN Magazine. Extensively researched, ESPN: The Uncensored History presents a fascinating, candid, revealing story in clear, unambiguous, and highly evocative language. A singularly memorable and compelling ""tell-all"" book, ESPN: The Uncensored History is strongly recommended reading for all sports buffs."
3,"Good information, poorly written","I found the first portion of this book to be very boring. The remainder of the book proved to be very informative for this fan who began watching upon his first day living in the USA back in 1982. Eventhough I enjoyed the final two-thirds of the book, I found it to be extremely scattered. It jumped from one topic to another. How about seperate chapters for each topic? Overall, this is a worthwhile read for any ESPN fan."
2,Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover,"Just because it says ""ESPN"" on the cover does not mean it is worthy of the same adoration as SportsCenter! Very choppy, not written well, boring at times and confusing by jumping time frames. Worth 2 stars to find out few interesting facts about current staff."
2,"not bad, but too much sexual harassment angle","I think Freeman's book is a good history of how ESPN became the media giant that it is (I was born in 1982-- i cant imagine life without ESPN), but the book focused WAY too much on the sexual harassment angle, and it bogs down the story."
2,Too much emphasis on the sexual harassment angle,"I am a fan of ESPN and enjoyed learning about the history of the company (channel, network, whatever you want to call it). I particularly enjoyed the first quarter of the book that focused on the original entrepeneur that started the network. However, after that I thought the author focused too much on the bad parts of the history, particularly the sexual harassment incidents. While these seem very serious and should have been mentioned, I don't think they should have overshadowed everything else in the company's history in the last decade."
5,"A Don""t Miss","I feel like i just found a treasure! a really great read from a really talented writer> if you want your spirituality delivered to you in a refreshingly candid way< then this is the book you""ve been searching for"
5,Inspiring !,This work is inspiring and I can relate many of the stories to my own life situations. It is easy to read and is a great bedside book as the chapters are short and serve as reminders of ways to strive to live life. Many good wishes to David on the book and in life.
4,Houses of God,"This is a good, well-researched volume on the built religious environment of the United States. Mr. Williams carefully establishes the history of this architecture in seven specific regions. The index of names is a disappointing alternative to a more extensive and general index. I also wished that the publisher (University of Illinois) had been able to provide additional photographic documentation."
2,Boring,"I found the narrative boring, where half the erotica is memories she's been through. The descriptions are short and lack imagination. I haven't even finished this book and not sure if I will."
3,not that bad,"for the most part i agree with the other reviewer. some more thoughts: i hated the ""ultimate"" design for gambit. he really looked like a slob, and not at all like the charmer we know and love. also, rogue was an extremely underdeveloped character here and definitely not a prime choice for the focus of a story arc so soon. i found myself not really caring much about her b/c this is pretty much the first ultimate story where she's the center of attention and we don't really know her at all. w/ that said, i found most of the other characterization to be decent. i like how dazzler (much much diff. from the other marvel character) is developing and hope to see more of her. also, there are some small emotional details like storm's lash-out at rogue and the last page that were handled well and proved to be highlights. all in all not the best in the series and not vaughan's best work, but if you're reading this review you're prob. going to get it anyway."
4,Ultimate X-Men hits double digits,"Well, this graphic novel is one of the better Ultimate X-Men I have read. This volume of Ultimate X-Men can only make one laugh and cry. A definite buy for any X-Men fan (long with the previous 9!). It's quite amazing how only 4 issues (Ultimate X-Men #50-53) can make one feel like days have passed after reading it."
2,One moment,"It has one really cool part where Gambit fights Wolveriene to a standstill. First because gambit kicks wolveriene's knee backwards, because tendons arn't bone, and second Gambit's abilities alows him to charge wolveriene's skeleton and cause him to explode. This part is far too brief.I did not even know of these twin villians in regular 616 marvel, and they failed to impress me here."
1,The big general grand story...,"... is going nowhere to my opinion: the only thing to see is the artwork, which is great. Maybe it's because i'm not used to the changes(especially that Dazzler look, when i expected something of a ""Lavigne"" look). Still the general story is 'too many things happening in too little time, and everybody running around, each to his/her work'Dazzler said: ""Yeah, team""... But where's the team?"
4,WHERE'S THE COLOR?,"I LOVED THE FILM AND THE CONCEPT. HOWEVER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY IN BLACK AND WHITE. THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN PORTRAYED IN FULL COLOR.SHARON CRAWFORD"
1,How to Introduce Stress,"Beautiful pictures and then downhill from there. Bland, boring, insipid, droning and meaningless narration. And if the accompanying music was played at a funeral I think the deceased would even get stressed out. I could take Earth Songs for only ten minutes before turing it to mute.What really aggravates me is that my local PBS station played this as a Fund Raiser. But at least I didn't buy it.I think the title should be changed to ""Earth Song - How to introduce stress"""
5,Reading Specialist rates Amazon.com DVD five stars,"After watching the National Geographic and BBC documentary ""Earth Songs"", I purchased this DVD ""Earth Songs"" on Amazon.com. Beautiful photos of famous mountains such as Matterhorn, Canadian Rockies, Grand Tetons, showing pristine views, rare animals and the beauty of nature. Music by Emmy Award-winning composer Brian Keane and Grammy nominated composer Michael Hoppe. Ageless wisdom, inspiring poetry and narrative in background as pictures are viewed. Greenland, Hawaii, Iceland, Peru, Alaska, The Caribbean,and New Zealand are on this DVD. Very relaxing. DVD arrived on time and was packaged well.Sheralee Hill Iglehart, B.S., M.A."
3,Dissapointing,"Not as good as I had hoped it would be, basically a ""one time only"" DVD. Would not recommend it."
5,I adored this book!,"Cooking Like A Goddess allows us to see the sacredness in the everyday. By bringing spirituality into the kitchen, Johnson deepens our connection of home, hearth, and heart! Her book is full of suggestions for decorating, meditating, living and cooking in the kitchen (until now my least favorite room in the house!). Her recipes are delicious; they nurture the soul as well as the body! Reading and using this book is like a gift from a dear friend--deeply satisfying!"
4,Cooking Like a Goddess: Bringing Seasonal Magic into the Kitchen,This is a fun cookbook to read and it has really yummy and interesting recipes in it. It helps to bring seasonal cooking to a new awareness of food and self. I really recommend this book for a good time in the kitchen. NW
4,A Lovely Book,"I found ""Cooking Like A Goddess"" to be a lovely book with a lot of good information, ideas, and recipes. My only disappointment was that I found it to be a little elementary for women who have been involved in the Goddess movement for many years and who are great cooks."
5,Excellent look at how science studies women,"An analysis of the way science views women, this book has three main points: Women are not inferior to men, women are not superior to men, and women are not the same as men.I read this book in college and almost immediately used a small portion of it in my final project for Human Sexuality. From my own research, I learned that the author's analysis of my topic (the G-Spot) agreed with the primary sources. I do not doubt that the rest of the book is just as accurate.The reviewer who said that the author does not address the issue of abuse properly doesn't understand what the book is really about. It certainly is not about abuse, incest, or the like, nor what to do when you are recovering from it. It is about SCIENCE, and examples of biased interpretations of the same."
1,total crap,i agree with the other review that this is a hunk of crap. dont buy it. i made the same mistake n bought it ... wow it sucks
2,Incorrectly labeled a 'comedy',"I am a big fan of Caroline Quentin, and also enjoy Martin Clunes in Doc Martin so I thought - a BBC comedy - I'll try it. Well the first of the trilogy is more a sad drama (Caroline is VERY good in it)and I did not find any humor. The daughter who wanted to be a son was in no way a comedic plot. The second story with Clunes was, again, a drama and quite interesting. Not much was funny. The final part of the trilogy was indeed funny - although I was a bit put off by the picture on the cover. It worked, it fit the storyline and the acting was good and quite humorous."
3,Promise not kept,"In spite of the well known talents of Wilson and Clunes, and in spite of a huge hope of enjoyment, I have to say I was disappointed with this DVD. The stories were acceptable and the acting extremely good, but the overall pleasure I derived from the DVD was minimal - sadly. Martin Clunes' was particularly excellent, but even he couldn't raise this DVD above 'average' status."
4,Support Independent African-American Films!,"Honestly, it's at least 4.5 stars - this movie is definitely worthwhile. I saw it originally at the theatre and am awaiting the arrival of my DVD set (Trois 1 & 2) to add to my collection.Please understand that this film is not intended for a young audience - mature audiences will enjoy this thrilling ride from the beginning to end. Enjoy watching it was some friends because you will HAVE to discuss it with someone once the film is over!"
4,Shocking,A great movie. Tyson Beckford and Michael Jai White are hot in this movie. Plot kind of put me in the mind of Wild Things but erotic.
4,It's a movie classic indeed,"No need to take the kids... this movie is staright up for the adults. The commercial captured my attention as it played on BET weeks leading up to the opening night. The commercial did not say whether it would be at theatres, tv or video so I looked up the website and was excited beyond belief. I appreciate seeing movies that include great acting and a good plot. I enjoy a movie that makes you think. Unlike the comedies, hoodies and bigraphies, this Thriller will surely make wave for a new breed of directors to create movies that appeal to a group of us that want to see ""ourselves"" in different scenarios. I plan to see it again. It was hot!"
5,Some things are better left closed...or are they???,"HOT, HOT, STEAMY!!!!Psychologist Mia DuBois is in a boring marriage to an otherwise distracted husband. Enter new client Tammy (whose husband was brutally murdered and she is now the prime suspect). Doing something she knows is against Dr/patient ethics, she's drawn into Tammy's private life in order to gain her trust. Tammy introduces Mia to ""Pandora's Box.""Should she open it??? Yes, she does and what transpires is a tale of steamy sex, betrayal, deceit and in the end the ""BIG PAY BACK."""
2,"Weak Plot, marginal directing","This movie was not thrilling and the plot was weak and predictable. As a single man I enjoyed seeing the naked women, but there are videos that specialize in that. I had the weak plot figured out ten minutes into the movie. An abundance of sexuality in a movie usually covers a weak plot, and this was no different. Thrilling? Oh please. The only thing thrilling about this movie was the sex. If you like cheap thrills this is for you. If you want a real thriller, and mind challenging plot, pass this one up and watch the first one again. Like most sequels this one misses the mark horribly"
2,Did not give it to my child,"I bought this book to give to my Latina foster child who is 12 years old, hoping to encourage her to read. I had heard an interview with the author on NPR and thought this would be a good way for her to connect to literature. Luckily, I picked it up and read (most of) it. It is well written and pretty engaging. A turning point in the book is when the main character, a 14 year old, goes to a party with the ""popular"" kids and takes shots of tequila. That's not something I want to condone. There were no consequences for the drinking (except for a brief mention of getting sick on the sidewalk), the conflict was just with the popular kids and their ""mean"" attitude and who real friends were. Important, to be sure, but I just don't want to romanticize the alcohol aspect any more than it already is. If you aren't concerned about your child drinking or avoiding drink, it's a good story about family relationships and friendship."
3,A Tweens Review,I read this and it was not the best book!I don't think it could be more about the culture... I think this is for a 13 year old girl and up .... If you want a book about girls life then this is the book for you! But if you want a book all about culture and nothing more then
3,Average,"yes was quite disappointed in this book, did not live up to review in dynamic graphics magazine. has some good ideas but not always useful unless you have a large budget or a fantastic client who wants to go the extra mile!"
2,So so,This book was not as good as I hoped and expected. It was a little dated and delivery of this book was VERY slow. I would suggest other books.
1,I hated this book,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It is just a rambling collection of uninteresting, pretentious, and unrelated stories. There is no character development at all.The English also flows very awkwardly, although since he did win the nobel prize, I'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt that it is just a poor translation!"
1,Insufferable,"I found this book to be one of the most painful reads I have ever attempted. I was reading it for a book club. I would have gladly traded reading a chapter for a trip to the dentist. The author puts it best at one chapter near the end. He says that reading the chapter was optional.The changes in perspective, the journey - it was all pointless.I hated this book with a passion!"
4,"vivid, engrossing and soothing","This novel is very vivid, engrossing, tells about the nature of human beings, every chapter has some hidden meaning, full of practical truth, a bit of philosophy, sometimes very touching.Initially you will feel it is wastage of time reading this novel, but as , you move slowly , chapter by chapter you will realise the essence of the novel. In nutshell it seems that the book itself has a soul, and you are face to face with her.If you have not been to villages, moving among high rise scrappers, concrete jungle, wants to know about the basic human nature, wish to roam in the scenic beauties, wish to be in nature's lap , I highly recommend this book."
3,Travel journal,"This book gives you a first-person narrative of this author's travels in China during the 80's and offers some insights into what it'd have been like to travel as a backpacker in places like Yunnan. He mentions a few times about how he didn't have the funds to travel comfortably and describes the simple pleasures of just washing himself clean with a basin and hot water from a village farmhouse. One highlight I remember is of how he uses his cover as a journalist from Beijing? as a way to get his way through local officals in Yunnan, and vividly describes a water festival.It doesn't follow a straight narrative structure but jumps around as he describes his fictional? escapades with people he meets."
1,"Very, very badly translated","I'm an Overseas Chinese and reading this book in English just seemed so weird because the ideas and style in which he writes is very very Chinese. The translator doesn't even stop (or footnote) in order to truely differenciate say between the use of 'Lao Gong' as opposed to 'Zhang Fu'. They mean the same thing (husband) but the subtle differences make a hell lot in such a poetic book. My conclusion is that it's a really badly translated book where all the magic is lost. I can't imagine a non-Chinese person reading it and truely getting the full impact of it. I just hope the Nobel organization did not award him the prize based on this book or translations of such poor quality. Otherwise I can't help but question if it was all just a matter of ""First Chinese to win the Nobel literature prize"" card that was behind the decision. Skip this book, you're better off with Nien Cheng"
2,Interesting Style Yet Disappointing Content,"Although this is considered one of the author's best volumes, I was rather disappointed at the lack of literary quality that the book offers. The style used becomes better and better as one advances through the book, yet there are few passages which can be deemed to contain truly remarkable prose. The reader can find it useful, however, to read ""Soul Mountain"" because an interesting overview of everyday-life people dealing with the problems of Communism is given. Considering that I was born in and lived in a communist country for a while, I found it relevant to compare some of the social phenomena related to Chinese Communism to those encountered in Europe in the 1980s."
2,This one needs Cliff Notes,"I thought it was a joke when I found there were Cliff Notes for ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" a wonderful book. Now, I truly believe for us lesser minds that we could dearly use a Cliff Notes to accompany Soul Mountain--tedious, obstruse, awfully hard to plow through."
2,Quite Difficult to Comprehend What's Real and Imagined...,"A third-grader would know enough vocabulary to read this book from beginning to end. It is what the philosophical implication of the work that baffles me, and probably, many. Instead of being a novel, Soul Mountain reads as if it is made up of 80 short stories (the book is divided into 80 chapters). Call it diary or freelance essays, the chapters don't seem to have apparent connection with one another. I do not quite understand the implications of ""I"" and ""you"" used throughout the work. It seems to me that ""you"" is actually the reflection of ""I"". ""You"" and ""I"" are used in alternating fashion throughout the book. The authorial self is thus (I guess) divided into first-person and second-person perspectives. It seems that the author reflects on his actual trip when he uses ""You"". Again I might have to re-read and find the answer."
2,"Nice concepts, weak on details","This book asks lots of great questions and makes a lot of great statements. However, it lacks any depth as far as providing practical information about implementing a mentoring program. (eg. no examples, case studies, etc...)The content is a good introduction to mentoring - but probably comprable to what you'd find in a chapter in most any ""Managing 101"" type of book.I would not recommend this book."
5,Great musicians present great jazz based on Bach Chorales,"I had the privilege to be present at Yoshi's the night this album was recorded. Everyone there was held spellbound by this music--which is classic and yet modern. Each piece begins with the Bach chorale statement and then these excellent musicians take the melodies present in every level of Bach and make concert jazz. My favorite is number four on the album ""Hilf, Herr Jesu, lass gelingen,"" but the listener cannot go wrong with any of the nine numbers. The instrument combination of piano, cello and soprano saxophone is unusual to me, and I think it would surprise Bach also; but I also believe this is an exceptional way to get an appreciation of the beauty of the classical line while enjoying the modern presentation. The music is decorous and sensual at the same time--a most intriguing mix."
3,Just Doesn't Quite Work,"I had high hopes for this CD, which features a jazz trio (Ira Stein on piano, David Zinn on soprano saxophone, and Joseph Hébert on cello) improvising on nine Bach chorales in a live session that was recorded in Oakland, California, on September 29, 1998. Unfortunately, things just don't quite work. There seems to be nothing drastically wrong, but a number of little things just don't seem right, such as the sound of the soprano sax, the little pauses in the phrasing, the little swoons in the rhythm. The majesty and timelessness of Bach's inspiration begins to sound like so much New Age mindlessness. The Jacques Loussier Trio does jazz-inflected Bach much, much more convincingly than these three gentlemen."
5,One of the most enjoyable and challenging CD's I've heard.,Bach Improvisations is wonderfully relaxing and at the same time quite stimulating. I find myself listening to this incredible CD at all hours of the day and night.
5,Knight Rider K.A.R.R.,"The K.A.R.R. is supposed to be a collectors item ... but my 11 year old son plays with his and he loves it! It's not an educational toy obviously, and would last for ever if I could convince him to leave it on the shelf. I'm sure he will break it eventually but it is metal, so is tough. If you are looking for a model of K.A.R.R. go for this one. I may even buy another one."
3,Quirky but Enjoyable,A back-door insight into British pop culture and humor. I doubt Winston Churchill would approve -- British pop culture has not improved over the past century -- but we laughed anyway.
3,Book didn't need to be written.,"The ultimate source on Abraham Lincoln's death already exists. ""Blood on the Moon"" by Edward Steers Jr. Go there.Also, anything with a quote of praise from Gerald Posneron the back, need be called into question."
4,I agree,"I can only echo the other reviews in that this is careful, meticulous history going back to first principles and overlooked sources and not just another layer added to the existing layer cake. This is a book that is not obsessed with methodolgy or mystery but examines the character at the heart of the event. Kauffman's Booth is a more human, more interesting, and more nefarious character than suggested by his usual reduction to 'deranged actor' or 'unbalanced actor.' Kauffman's analysis of the conspiracy trial is more balanced and interesting than the contemporary assumption that it was entirely a railroad job by the government."
5,interesting and informative,"this was an interesting, well written account of john wilkes booth and the lincoln assasination. it provided the reader with a very accurate image of the era and political climate at the time without being a boring political analysis. the characters were very well laid out, as was the terrain covered in the escape. you could almost feel that you were there. it differed in opinion here and there with ""manhunt"", but not in any significant way. it was so inspiring to me that i booked the ""john wilkes booth tour"" through the surratt museum out of clinton, md. the tour was expensive ($60 per person, plus food and lodging and a 4 hour drive)and a great disappointment and i would not recommend it, but i would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in this topic."
5,"This is the ""Bible"" of all Lincoln Assassination literature","This is the most thoroughly documented history of the subject, and is portrayed in a most interesting manner, a great read. You will not want to put it down. If you are interested in the subject of the Lincoln Conspiracies, this is the FIRST book you buy."
5,Enthralling,"A thorough, enthralling, and riveting account of one of the darkest moments in American history. Grabs you and pulls you into a moment in history... and does not let you go."
5,great book(as well as e-book),"I purchased this book as a gift for a brother-in-law after I had already purchased the e-book for myself. I read it 3 times in the last 4 months, and it was great everytime. Well written. Any history buff will love it."
5,An exceptional work,"AMERICAN BRUTUS is an exceptional work. I've read it twice and will probably read it again. I especially appreciate the source material provided by the author.Anyone who enjoys history and/or the story of the Lincoln assassination, will find this book to be a valuable source of information and an engaging read."
4,"Great read, Questionable suppositions","Kauffman is an excellent writer and the book is a great read, no doubt. As one who has read a great deal about Lincoln, his assassination, and the Booths I found lots of fresh ideas, some new information, and some rollicking passages of prose.I'd caution anyone looking for an objective take on the facts to keep the proverbial grains of salt on hand. Not that Kauffman isn't factually accurate (I trust that he is) but he clearly interprets those facts in a way that most others wouldn't. He gives Booth much more credit for Machiavellian machinations and cunning than I. The title of the book alone is telling. And his contention that Booth's leg wasn't broken in his leap to the stage but later in his escape when his horse fell is complete conjecture painted as fact.Overall, I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the assassination and John Wilkes Booth's motives and workings."
1,Almost any other review book would be better.,"Although it ""covers"" all the topics on the PE exam, this text does so in a rather dis-jointed and confusing manner. The 300 tables are randomly spaced throughout the book and not terribly useful. A much better text is the ""ME Ref. Manual"" by Michael Lindeburg."
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR...,"I purchased this PE Exam Preparation package to supplement my study, using the MERM as the primary study guide. I must agree with the other reviews. After reviewing the first chapter, I found the following issues:1) Simple proof reading errors that should have been caught, both in the examples and chapter problems.2) Inconsistent answer solution detail - some are very detailed (great), while others choose to skip some steps.For example: Chapter 8 - Fuels and Combustion, has virtually no structure in the solutions to the examples. It is almost as if the author is verbally explaining the solution, and a person is writing it down as they go.I hope the 8th Edition has addressed these issues, but I personally do not want to evaluate. In any event, one should NOT use this package as the sole resource. The MERM by M. Lindeburg, and MGI PE Readiness program should be used first."
1,Terrible! Do not buy!,"Just what the other reviews said. I had problems finding the ME reference book, so I bought this one instead because it was endorsed by ASME. It has tons of errors and I found it extremely difficult to follow the example problems. This book is not at all useful for studying for the PE exam unless you have all of the references listed in the back of the book. I was hoping to find a book that I could use during the actual PE exam as a reference, and this is not it. Do yourself a favor and go buy the ME reference book instead."
1,Fine film ruined by dreadful print,What a disappointment this pressing of Ken Russell's wonderful movie this is. It is supplied without the necessary red/green glasses and all the pairs that I have with other films refused to give me anything but the most minimal 3D effect. The film remains out of focus throughout and is unwatchable - so back to the standard print. This 3D version is an absolute disaster and should be avoided at all cost.
3,"Rider too big, but still a nice horse.","As with most Breyer classics, the rider here is about 7 feet tall and doesn't look appropriate for the horse. (The English set similar to this one comes with even nicer tack, and that rider is too big to fit in the stirrups at all!) This handsome pinto comes with a really nice headstall, but the saddle is dull and monochromatic and plastic-looking. Your average Grand Champion saddle would be better suited for him.Probably worth the buy just to get the horse and bridle, but Breyer really needs to make a smaller, jointed doll that is sized right for these classic sized horses and ponies. Some of these riders look like *they* should be the ones wearing the tack."
5,"Fascinating mix of adventure, introspection & enlightenment.","I am a long time admirer of Tim Cahill's work and picked up ""Out of the Noosphere"" on that basis. I was delighted to find so many other authors equally as adventurous and thoughtful. Anyone who loves travelling for the pure joy of meeting different people, seeing new vistas, and having his/her world view challenged will love this book. The writing is superb, each story/article is a good length for commuter readers. I particularly like the way each author brings you personally into the action...you have to think about what you would do in a similar situation. And the situations are mind expanding -- from killer bee research, to losing friends in mountain climbing accidents. I couldn't recommend it more highly!"
4,Very nice Selection,Bought this for my older brother for Christmas. My Dad always listened to The Nutcracker so am familier with it since childhood. It is a bit shorter than some versions but still a good choice
2,Not happy about this product.,"The music on this CD is lovely, however, some of the ballet dances are missing and makes the CD disappointing and short."
1,"CD not the one I ordered, arrived in a cracked case","I purchased this cd for my wife as a gift just before Christmas. I didn't expect it to arrive before Christmas and it didn't, but when it finally did come, the cd case was cracked and it did not match the cd description. The cd that arrived was only SELECTIONS from the Nutcracker, not the whole thing.To make matters worse, I have contacted the seller regarding their return policy, but they refuse to respond. I am very dissatisfied."
2,a long wait to receive this item,the product was great but it took me OVER a month to get it ..It kind of defeated the purpose of me buying it ..Because I bought it to share with my grand daughter before we went to the Nutcracker and got it 1 day before we went ;(
1,Bait and Switch,I ordered this selection thinking I was getting what was listed unfortunately I opened the package before looking at the track listing. The cover matched so I thought all was well but apparently there are differences in the year this CD was produced. BUYER BEWARE!
3,Reads a lot like a string of individual essays tied together,"Definitely not a book to take to the beach. Pretty dense, though not theoretical. Mostly, Ferguson wades through mountains of empirical data about spending to GDP ratios and democracy indices in search for answers to big questions: economic determinism, the rise of the state, the spread of democracy, etc. I mostly read it for the thesis about how tax rates are related to the ratios between taxpayers and voters, i.e., the lower the ratio, the higher the rate of direct taxes, and the higher the ratio, the higher indirect, or regressive taxes. An interesting book, though not destined to be a classic."
4,War as Investment,"This book is a fascinating read for everyone who is interested in the application of economic theory to world history. Reviewing and rejecting economic determinist theories like marxism, the political business cycle and imperial overstretch, Ferguson advances his own argument. It is war that brought us modern finance, bureaucracy and democracy. The outcome of war cannot be predicted with accuracy, but the nation that can finance it at least costs has a comparative advantage. Ferguson skillfully applies modern expectations theory to his historical account. He argues that military hegemony can spread good institutions around the globe as happened under British rule. You can disagree with his plea for benevolent imperialism in an age in which nations want to determine their own future. Moreover, it is questionable whether war `pays', since the costs of war exceeded revenues in most cases as Ferguson points out. But, this did not stop nations and groups from waging war."
1,WRONG WRONG WRONG,COMPLETELY FALSE DESCRIPTION!!! The item I received was illustrated by Adam McCauley...NOT THE ORIGINAL JULIE BRINCKLOE. I did not order this just for the stories...I ordered this for nostalgia....and now that's completely useless because this is NOT the same book and NOT the same illustrations that I grew up with. The photo shown is NOT the item that you will receive. Returning this asap. Fail Amazon.
3,From what I remember,"I've owned this book since I was a little girl. I think I got it through a school sale. I loved it. Sometimes I read it before bed to calm my brain down at night. I found it again recently and re-read it. Funny stuff. As a child, I wanted to go to school there. The parents are all but absent. Your kids will love it."
5,Best book by far,"Sideways Stories from Wayside School, by Louis Sachar, is one of my all-time favorite books. He is also one of my favorite authors, he also wrote Holes and There's a Boy in the Girl in the Bathroom.Side Ways Stories from Wayside School is about this very mean teacher named Mrs. Gorf. She's so mean that she eats students! How does she do it, you'll have to read to find out!All of the characters are paranoid to go to school. John, Fibi, Terrence and others are all freaked out about being is Mrs. Gorf's classroom. Read the book to find out if they get rid of Mrs. Gorf.This is my favorite book because it has humor, tootsie pops and more. Louis Sachar writes great cliffhangers and always makes me want to read on.The book teaches you that in the end, good will overcome evil and that you better watch out for teachers that can wiggle their ears!"
5,still fabulous.,"I had to re-read this book for a project for an education graduate class and it's still as good as I remember, over 10 years later. The book is funny, both for kids and the teachers that will assign them this book. It is the story of the teachers and students on the 30th floor of Wayside School. Wayside School isn't your ordinary school because the school was built 30 stories tall, with a classroom on each floor instead of one floor with 30 classrooms. The 30+ characters are very distinctive and have a witty and hilarious story that goes along with each of them. The book is appropriate for 4-6th grade students and there are so many projects, both literate and artistic that can be done with this book. I definitely recommend it for your child or for your classroom."
5,Still love this book more than twelve years later!,"I loved these stories as a kid twelve or so years ago, and I still love them today. I really believe that the Wayside School series were one of the books that sparked my lifelong love of reading. They have the power to enthrall any kid with a sense of humor. That humor can be pretty crude at times, but never inappropriate. They have short chapters to hold kids' attention. Definitely recommended for kids age 7-12."
4,Wayside school,"I like the story because it was funny. I`m going to tell you about some of the characters ,Mrs.Gorf turned bad kids in to apples. Mrs.Jewls thought they were monkeys and my favorite part is the end when I found out Louis was telling the story.By/Megan"
5,Sideways Stories from Wayside School,I think this book is very funny and I like a lot of short stories more than a long story.i love this book so much.
5,All The Way Sideways,This is a great book by Louis Schar. It is about Mrs Jewils Class it tells about every person in the classroom. Like for example The three triplets and the teacher also. When Mrs. Jewils comes to teach the class after the first teacher turns her self into an apple. She calls all the students monkeys and thinks that they are angels. Because she has never teached students that are so well behaived and so talented. Except one person who doesn't know how to count.
5,Great Buy,The book was priced very cheap and it was in new condition when I received it. THe power cord works great but the chord is shorter than the original. I am satisfied with both of my purchases.
5,This book makes kids laugh a lot!,"I teach first, second and third graders in a Montessori School, and they thought these stories were hilarious and interesting. I, or my assistant, reads the book aloud during our lunch hour, and when we ask the children ""should I stop reading now?"" they all shout ""NO!""They liked the book so well, that we are now reading another book in the ""Wayside School"" series. As a teacher I'm always looking for books the children will love. My terrific assistant found these, and they are great!"
4,How would You Like To Be The New Kid At Wayside School?,"I think this book is really good! I like this book because it is very funny! It's about aCrazy School called wayside and there is no 19th story, but there is a 20th to the 30th And a 1st to the 18th, but there is no 19th story. The story is manly about the 30th story.The teacher on the 30th story is named Mrs. Jewls. The teacher before Mrs. Jewls was Mrs.Gorf. Mrs. Gorf turned the kids in her class into apples."
4,Wayside School,"In the book Wayside School, Louis Sachar writes about a very unusual school. For instance one of the characters, John, only can read upside down, and yet he always gets straight A's. In one chapter Louis Sachar is the yard teacher.I was surprised when I read Wayside School Gets Stranger, it knocked my socks off. If I was in this book I would run away and screaming my head off.This book will make you gag and laugh. I believe that people will like it. If you like humour, you will like this."
5,My Childhood Favorite,I LOVED this book as a child. My teacher would read us one chapter after lunch every day and it was the highlight of my day! (maybe 2nd or 3rd grade?) After she was done I asked my mom to get me my own copy and I read it again. I forgot about this book for years and then all of a sudden today it popped back up in my head. I got very excited because now my oldest son is almost old enough for me to read it to him! I've lost my copy so I'll order another one soon. I can't wait! I KNOW he's going to love it!
2,"Interesting, but system doesn't work well","Well, I enjoyed the book immensely, and liked the author's concept of the Directional Day Filter. Anyway, he bases his entire system on breakouts against the trend. Using my live market feed, I automated his rules to a letter via a homegrown app, and my losses mounted by the day. I implemented his definition of Support and Resistance, and whenever I broke through these levels, and the appropriate stochastic indicators indicated that I buy or sell, I would buy or sell short appropriately, and the stock would invariably reverse shortly thereafter. His mechanism was not reliable at all. To the contrary, you can get some good info from his book, and trade of support and resistance levels by themselves, reversing position when these respective levels are hit. This makes entirely more sense, and will allow you to profit consistently, contrary to what the author stipulates."
3,"Interesting strategies, but don't try it with real money.","There are some entry strategies, stop placements, and indictor setups (clayburg method) in this book. It's a good read in a sense that it provided some good groundwork and concept of a trading plan/strategies/tactics... etc. Oscillating indictors don't quite work in a trending market, so if people wants to trade that method (and EXACTLY that method) in the current market, then all they would see are a bunch of indicators in the oversold area. If you want to daytrade using only information from this book... bad idea too, it is far from a complete strategy. Overall, a good book to read, hey, Clayburg knows how to write a book, reader friendly, and alot of hype. So read between the lines and pickup something useful from the book. I give it 4.5 stars for the info, but minus 1.5 stars for the hype."
3,Fact or Fiction?,I have purchased this book prior to reading up about this author. It seems that his trading record is not great so I wonder how effective what he presents in his book is what the title suggests.
4,A very good TA book that reaches beyond TA,"Unlike most other TA books that only go into details of certain TA tools, the author tried to post the big picture of TA tools as means of creating effective trading strategies that lead to his so called high probability trades. Adopting a step by step approach, he first outlined and explained a number of TA methods, and then reduced these methods to the four steps of trading success he promoted, which are:-1. Determine the major trend of the day2. Determine the minor trend of the day3. Define an exact entry point4. Determine an exit strategyIn my opinion, this book is really helpful and easy to understand. There is plenty of 1-min graphs elaborating the author’s ideas, primarily for stock day trading. Though the prinicples are quite applicable also for longer term trading, I hope that the author will write another book for those position traders like myself."
1,signals don't work,"I agree with the writer who programmed Clayburg's signals into his software; the idea of entering a long position in the countertrend simply doesn't work most of the time. Other than that, the book is gramatically well written."
3,TCP/IP For Dummies By Dummies,"I was mislead by the title. This book doesn't teach us the innards of TCP/IP or its programming or adminstration. Instead, it is a shallow survey of internet applications. All the good info is pointed at (rather than included) in the form of urls. I spent $20 for a bookmarks folder. It should have been called Internet for Chefs. The food analogies were the worst the authors could have chosen to illustrate the concepts. They were distracting, annoying and downright harmful to the text flow. The humor was tasteless, and the constant ridiculing of the ""nerdy jargon"" gives the feeling of authors who hate the subject matter rather than love it."
4,"Good introduction for beginners, not easy to digest","Let me start with the good news: This book is packed with information regarding TCP/IP. All of the issues are in here: all the various protocols/support programs related to TCP/IP for both Windows and Unix/Linux. And a lot of it is written in the famous light-hearted dummies-style that keeps the book relatively easy going.What irks me is the organization of the book. Some of it is VERY basic (explaining client/server for example). In contrast, other parts go into fine detail, containing exhaustive lists for example. Overall the book left a somewhat unorganized impression, a bit of a gathering of loosely connected issues in no particular order. For me, this made it diffcult to ""digest"" the book and remember the info in it.In summary, if you are looking for a book that will allow a beginner to look up some of the jargon, this book is not a bad choice. For an introductory or advanced textbook, look elsewhere."
3,Enough with the bad comparisons,After only a few pages I found that the book was going to be more of an attempt to make you laugh than to explain TCP/IP. I found the bad comparisons to be annoying and distracting. I would only recommend this book to someone who only wants a vague understanding of TCP/IP or to someone who's sole purpose in life is to fill up their bookcase with the cute little yellow 'for dummies books.
3,"dissapointing, but interesting","To say the least I was dissapointed with this book. I thought that I was going to be provided with a clear insight into TCP/IP using normal everyday terms. Good, but definitely not worth your $20. The chapter on ""security"" was laughable. The only interesting chapters in the entire book was the one on IP addressing, and on routing. I must admit, though, that the book does give excellent resources for learning more (no books, just free internet resources!)."
4,Fun and Interesting Read,"Just For Fun accomplished exactly what Linus Torvalds set out to do: make a book and have fun doing it. The reader senses that this has been accomplished throughout the book. The book contains technical elements, but the reader does not necessarily have to be a technical person. Linus himself remarks early in the book that a non-technical reader should skip to page 119 to avoid some technical jargon. Furthermore, the reader does not have to be a die-hard Linux enthusiast to enjoy the book. The book is inspiring and fascinating -- detailing the growth of an operating system, a revolution, an era, and a person. As a computer enthusiast, someone who works in the industry, and someone who has dabbled in Linux over the years, the book opened my eyes to the benefits of the open-source movement. A truly interesting read."
2,interesting and annoying at the same time,"Frankly speaking, I'm usually too lazy for writing reviews.Because I was so disappointed by the book, I write one now.The good aspect of the book is that one gets a glimpse of what kind of guy Linus Torvalds is. That's quite interesting - since his regarded as being a kind of superstar.The bad aspect (for me) is that this guy's arrogance and overestimation of his merits is so annoying.The book delivers what you might expect in a biography about a 34 year old operating-system-programming-know-it-all ... but not more."
3,"Interesting story, but poor structure","The Linus Torvalds story is definitely an impressive one, and it is quite interesting to see the story of Linux from his point of view. It's also inspirational for people getting started in the computer field, particularly programmers.However, the book is bogged down by David Diamonds' ""journalist hanging with Linus"" interjections. Yes, he observes things about Linus that Linus himself doesn't reveal, but the way that these short chapters are randomly scattered about the book are distracting and at some points amateurish -- it seems like a mid-level reporter trying to adopt the edgy, first-person style of a ego-driven British journalist or some kind of journalist superstar, which he is not.Still, the parts narrated by Linus are a good read, and I would say they are a must-see for anyone interested in the open source or Linux communities."
4,"The next Bill Gates, but not as greedy.","This is a very interesting book from someone who lived with compliers for years. I never really understood the thinkings behind open source untill I read this book. This is a great book for those interested in the other side of technology business that is not driven by pure greed. I give it 4 stars because I don't think it might appeal to non technical people. Other than that, it's worth the money. The best lesson I learned from this book is never go for predictable success and lose the chance to achieve really really big sucess. Linux definitely has the potential to be bigger than Windows"
4,Enjoyed reading it,"Nice reading, several good ideas.Mr. Torvalds deserves what he got.I just hope to use some day Fredix or Diannix OS.Jag gör det!"
1,can i get my money back ?,"If you are a Linux user then you probably know everything in this book. very shallow and Linus spends the first part of the book talking how poor he is and the second part about how rich he is. he meets his wife and he goes from meeting to moving in w/ her in a paragraph, meetings w/ computer greats take one or two sentances. no insights and behind the scenes talk from the Linux world. does he like Alan Cox ? Caldera ? what about the new kernal ? why did he release it when he did ? was the work too much for him ? all in all very dissapointed in Linus for putting out such a poor book."
2,Surely there's more,"I have to agree with the less flattering reviews. A well thought out search of some newsgroup and mailing list archives would yield pretty much the same or comparable results. Not that this book is wihtout value - it just would make more sense as an inexpensive paperback to read as a collection of anecdotes while on smoke breaks or something. Sadder still, I've seen enough Linus interviews, public speaking engagements, etc to believe he is a charming and genuinely interesting character, easily capable of populating 6 or 700 pages of a ""Memoirs so far..."" sort of thing with worthwhile reading."
1,Expecting much better,"First problem Mr. Torvalds co-wrote the book - should've left it to the professionals. Though one gets the impression from the book that he's such a control freak that wasn't an option. Considering his ego I'm suprised the book wasn't longer. A lot of drivel, negative comments about industry people he's met, ego stroking, self-important blather. He's cashed out, made his millions and good for him - think he'd acknowledge the Free Software Foundation/GNU etc. instead of critizing them. Nothing wrong with being a sell-out, just don't deny it and minimize the contributions others made to your success."
2,"It's OK, but nothing new","I read the excellent ""Rebel Code"" and thought that reading ""Just for Fun"" would be a nice idea, to know more about Linux and its author through his own words. The problem is that Linus and the journalist who helped him failed to make the book interesting, so it becomes a sequence of chapters like ""yeah I needed a new driver for my modem, so...well I did it""In one page he's doing Linux version 0.01 alone in his bedroom in Helsinki, 15 pages later he's talking about having 10 million users, and leaves no clue HOW it happened, or who was involved (guys like Dave Miller and Alan Cox, so important to the Linux community, didn't get one single mention)So if you want to really understand not only WHAT happened but HOW it happened, I recommend ""Rebel Code"" instead. And it covers not only Linux, but the whole open-source movement."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading a ""here's why and how I did it"" type of book, but this was more along the lines of a disjointed memoir, jumping from place to place with little clarity or organization. Aside from some interesting back story on Linus and Tanenbaum (of MINIX fame), most of the content is already public knowledge. I would have liked to have gotten a little more inside of Linus's head on some of the topics, but it was a good overview, nonetheless."
3,Inappropriate but good book besides,"This book tells you about Linus's childhood from his birth, to when he took all the credit of Richard Stallman's hard work. It really gets you mad at him. He also critisized everyone who had the slightest disaggreement with him, from Richard Stallman, who actually did all the hard work while Linus sat around and drank beer, to Steve Jobs, who didn't aggree with everything that Linus thought. Since we are rating the book and not the person, I would give it 3 stars."
2,"Good Start, Poor finish ... not put together very well","One reason I rated this audio CD so low was the packaging- The 5 CD's aren't labeled. This made change CD's inthe car difficult.- As far as I could tell, the CD's were all just one track.Most recorded books put a chapter on each track.In my car CD player, they way you forward is to skip to thenext track. Not possible with this one.This book started as a great telling of history. The author really got to know Linus well and I feel he presented Linus as he really is ... the good, the not so good, the learning experiences. It was really nice to hear the history of Linux. The end was a disappointment. The book finishes by pontificating on Intellectual Property rights. Interesting, but not what I was in the market to purchase."
3,Too big,"The boots are ok, but they tend to be too big, even after measuring, so they slip off easily."
4,the next generation of star wars...,"I bought Jar Jar along with several other Star Wars figurines from Amazon after doing many different online searches for them. These figurines are great, and they are for my 2 and 1/2 year old who has found out early how great the Star Wars movies and characters are. Great for his imagination. Although the age limit is higher, he still has a great time holding them and playing with them. I just took away the 'sticks' and such."
3,Book Compliments other Astrology Books,"This book is a good compliment to any Astrology library, but don't waste your time or money on this author's personalized ""readings"". He provided very little, if any, insight and then this author blamed the caller for the author's vague personalized consultation."
3,I Was Disappointed,"Maybe my response to this book is biased and unfair, since I'm still aggravated about being described as a doormat who should seek the company of people gracious enough to refrain from walking on me... and that is essentially all he said. Oh, yes... I forgot, he also said I'm a ""proficient escapist"" and when ""the crap hits the fan"" I'm ""nowhere to be found"" leaving other people to deal with everything. The only thing this book has to offer are extremely simple descriptions of sign combinations and none are longer than a few paragraphs. The phrasing on some sign combinations is so grandiose that it seems to suggest the author thinks that a person born with this combination is the coolest critter ever to grace the Earth. Other descriptions are so condescending they sound mocking... and then it's over, like getting to the end of the message in a fortune cookie. This is a book of very limited substance."
5,Better than I expected in some ways,"When I received this rack it took my husband awhile (in my opinion)to put it together. He said it was quite easy to assemble. So once it was put together it was more sturdy than I expected, which is a plus. However, my 5 1/2 shoes with heels are not big enough to stay on the rack. I simply put them under the rack on the floor and flats on the rack. SO, overall the product is good."
1,Misleading,"This is JUST Volume 2 of 10, not the whole shebang as the title as you might be lead to believe. It is poorly formatted. Get the free version instead."
4,good if you like ashtanga yoga,but why did they film the class with that stupid post in the way?!?the DVD really makes you feel like you are in an ashtanga class. I wouldn't suggest it for someone who has never taken ashtanga before because the positions are not explained.
5,"This is the one- Beryl Binder Birch's ""Power Yoga""",I have done other yoga tapes in the past and none were as challenging as this one. If you truly want to grow and improve your ashtanga practice this is the one to try. I also like the fact that there were people of varying ages in the class. It's nice to see how yoga can improve your quality of life as you getr older.
1,Label your product,"I am very frustrated with this purchase. NOWHERE on the cover does it even state that this video is not for beginners, and after reading the reviews by others on this website, it obviously is only for the very advanced. The back of the dvd box reads ""The students on-screen, ranging widely in age and ability, demonstrate modifications"" ...... LIES!!! To repeat... At least MENTION IT IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Now I am stuck with the purchase. Oh yea, the claim ""with detailed explanations"" is a JOKE. Just read the other reviews. Summary- purposely concealed the intended audience to increase sales to unsuspecting consumers. An HONEST description would have been the ETHICAL way to go about promotion of her product!"
3,"for the advanced, for sure","I really wanted to like this DVD, but I was pretty disallusioned after making it through the practice. I've been doing power yoga several times a week for over a year, and I'm in very good shape, but I found this to be too difficult and was not satisfied by doing the modified poses. I felt like if I couldn't do the full poses, I was not getting as good of a workout. There were so many poses that I couldn't even come close to doing that I ended up wondering, ""Who can do this? And how long do you have to practice before you can do these kinds of poses?"" I guess I'll hold onto it and pull it back out in a few years - maybe then it won't make me feel like such a newbie! I do think the real problem with a lot of these yoga videos and DVDs is that there is no univeral rating system - it's almost impossible to tell before you buy one whether or not you're going to find it too easy or too difficult."
3,Tina from NY,"This is a very advance yoga workout. I found it helpful because I was looking for some additionally challenging yoga postures, well I found it. In reality, it's a little over the top unless your a very dedicated and practice yoga on a daily basis. I do asanas daily (power style) so it is appropriate for me, but most people I know do not practice daily and if they do this video they are likely to hurt themselves. So if you are not doing regular ashtanga style or power style yoga on a regular basis, don't get this, it will be to difficult for you. If however, you practice power/or ashtanga yoga regularly, here is the next step to challenge yourself. (Dont' expect to perform all the postures at first)"
2,"Interesting, but impractical","I found most of the positions impossible. It was interesting to see a woman of BBB's age able to do the positions, and also the people in her class; but I don't think the tape is practical for any but those very advance in yoga - or double-jointed spiders. She also says in the tape, it's meant to be used in conjunction with her book. This must be so, because she isn't clear at all in what you are to do, except for spurting out the Indian lingo for positions, and she assumes you already know what they are. If you can do her tape, you'd be making your own."
4,Great DVD,This is a wonderful DVD... Beryl has been around forever.. Gotta love her Ashtanga background. Also check out TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION
2,For the EXTREMELY flexible only,"I have been taking yoga classes for almost two years now, and this is the only tape I have ever purchased that is too difficult for me. If you are not able to pull your feet up behind your head, this tape is not for you."
1,"Too fast, No backbends","I do not recommend this DVD. I consider myself pretty experienced and I enjoy more challenging workouts (Brian Kest, Eion Finn). This workout goes too far though. She moves so quickly between poses that I find myself becoming stressed out trying to keep up! That is certainly not what I want from my yoga practice. I found it really ironic that several times during the workout she actually preaches &quot;Don't rush&quot;. Ha, that is exactly what she is doing, and unless you rush, you can't keep up with her. There are no backbends such as camel or bow so at the end of the workout you feel unbalanced because your hamstrings are really streched but your front side is still tight. I've tried doing this workout many times just thinking that I needed to improve my attitude or try harder but I've finally given up. I don't think I will ever enjoy this and I doubt many others will either."
5,Beryl's the Best!!!,Beryl Bender Birch Power Yoga: The Practice is the best dvd!!! Beryl is amazing!! The dvd motivates me to keep practicing. Thank you Beryl!
4,not for beginners,"I have been practicing yoga for only a few months. I am definitely a beginner. I enjoy doing this DVD, because for me it is extremely challenging. However, if you don't have much experience, you may feel a bit inadequate. The students seem to know which poses to do before the instructor even says them. I, on the other hand, had to look at the tv often to see what exactly they were doing, and that made it difficult to keep up. Plus, at 75 minutes, it may be a bit long for someone who is not already well conditioned.If you definitely want to be challenged, and won't mind watching a room full of people doing things to a much higher level than you can do, then purchase this DVD.Beryl is a wonderful teacher, and I'm sure that if you have the patience to keep doing the practice, you will do things you never thought were possible with your body."
5,I've been jumping for joy!!!,"""Jump Start Your Book Sales"" leaped off the library shelf at me last weekend and I've been jumping for joy ever since. Marilyn and Tom, thanks for a generous, empowering, straight-talk book for new authors just like me. My agent has been waiting for my finished manuscript since 1995. I'm glad I didn't send it in its original format, now that I've devoured your book. As a speaker, seminar leader, and national networker, I found the ideas and resources invaluable.

This book is a re-hash of information from the Guide to Self-Publishing, and much of it is contradictory ... What was most frustrating, though, were the constant ads for the authors' services.

1,works great until it just stops working,"It's mid-January and I've already 'burned through' two of these heaters since late October. They seem to work great...and they do, for a little while...but then one day they just suddenly stop working. It's true that I've left the heater on for 24+ hours non-stop at times (it's the only source of heat in my apartment), but that shouldn't matter, should it...? They should last more than four to six weeks, shouldn't they...? Well, so far, it has been my experience that they don't. WTF?"
1,A bad joke,The factory reconditioning is a mockery. I do not think it has anything to do with Amazon. The heater had a dent on one of the elements (altough there were no signs of mishandling on the box). The control board was comming off...Terrible. I returned it immediately.
4,Wonderful Heater,"The heater arrived in good condition but has a minor dent ... no complaint since this is a recondition unit. We bought this heater after 2 of our fan heaters broke. We have difficulty heating our baby's room with the fan heaters, but with this radiator heater, we have no problem. Also, since we have the radiator heater, our baby skin driness is healing and the room air is not as dry as when we used the fan heaters. Oh, this heater is very silent! Our baby is happy!"
1,A Public Relations Propoganda Piece,"I purchased Severed Trust with great expectations. Upon completion I can only say that the author is part of the problem. The book's advice and tone is pompous and arrogant at best. Misleading and misguided are also applicable adjectives.The twin pillars Lundenberg advocates for MDs to regain the trust and confidence of the American public are limiting access to the health-care system and limiting organ transplants to one per patient.Lundenberg fails to address the important health-care choices facing the public, including nutrition, diet, alternative treatments, and ever-increasing costs.The book is written by an MD so close to the problems he cannot or will not honestly critique his profession.Lundenberg's work is an insider's view of his own navel. It reads like a public relations piece rather than insightful examination of the issues and potential solutions in the public and private health-care arenas."
5,Red Doors offers the hottest Valentine's Day you could want!,"Red Doors is by far the best Valentine's anthology I've read. Funny, fast paced, steamy, these three stories have it all. Yet each stands fully on its own. My personal favorite was Sheer Delights but they were all entertaining. Very sexy heroes!! I can't wait to read these authors again."
1,A total waste of money,"Of the two dozen or so books about trading and technical analysis I have purchased over the last 15 years this book offers by far the least bang for the buck. This book is brief and does not offer anything particularly impressive. In fact, most of the material in it is readily available elsewhere. It is 42 pages and approximately half of those are charts. The charts are not very useful. This book is definitely not worth $1 per page. You will be very disappointed if you purchase this book expecting anything of substance."
3,cute but too heavy,"Belkin 3-Pack TuneTie for iPod/MP3 Player Earbuds (Green, Blue, Orange)I was looking for something to help manage my earphone wires during my morning walk. I had been using a little clip that I have from an old set, but kept losing the tiny clip. This device from Belkin is handy to wind the extra length of wire around but pulls downward and loosen the earpieces from my ears. Very annoying. Maybe it is not meant for that. I am going to look for extra little clips."
3,Average product,"The TuneTies function as described, however I found that the relatively small size of the product resulted in right wrapping which makes the cord of each of my earbud sets become overly coiled when untied. So they do keep your earbuds in a small, tidy space, but they also tangle the heck out of the cord when untied. I used them on 3 different sets (all 3 are a different brand) of earbuds and had the same problem with each. But that being said, they are relatively inexpensive, which helps make up for their problem."
1,Does NOT Do Its Job -- Doesn't Hang Onto the Cord,"I loved these except they were always letting go of the cord. They were designed so that the insertion slot was not tight enough to hold the cord. All three of the Belkin Tune-Ties fell off and were lost. So I tried the Smartwraps brand instead. They are much better! Where you insert the cord is much tighter. They have never unravelled. This is an inexpensive gift to yourself or someone else. Makes it much easier to keep the cord to MP3 players, etc. from getting in the way, tangled, snagged or cut. Yes, I did cut a headphone cord when I was pruning a tree and didn't notice that the Belkin Tune-Tie had unravelled once again, letting the cord dangle in the path of the shears. The Smartwraps would never do that. Save yourself money and frustration. Buy the Smartwraps instead.Sumajin Smartwrap Earphone Cord Manager (Set of 3 - Pink, Purple, Clear)"
2,Not a well engineered product,I don't really like these as they are only good to organize your cord when not wearing the earbuds and I needed something to use while wearing them.
4,"Old book, but really worthy","I bought this book 2 years ago, but still love it. If you have the first Absolut Book, then you definately should buy this."
2,Pointless movie,"This is a totally disappointing movie. With all this talent, much might be expected. But everyone is just going through the motions. The two principals are incredibly listless (as though they kept thinking ""Why on earth am I in this movie?""); only Renee Zellweger has any energy, in a dramatically unrewarding part. This movie lacks heart. That the two principals are not going to live happily ever after is completely predictable. And frankly who cares?"
3,COLD ENDING,"Civil War yarn longs to be epic in scope but remains an elaborate love story with Nicole Kidman waiting on new-found beau Jude Law to return from the war. The early battle scenes exhibit an authentic air and a scene with deserters being stung in a house of prostitution gives the film an unexpected horrific edge. The film's resolution, although intense, seems off-hand and pointless. The movie seems intent on avoiding a happy ending."
4,Good...but something isn't right,"Let me start off by saying Renee Zellwegger is wonderful in this film. After watching Jerry Maguire I never expected something like this from her. The cinematography is also great, as are the other actors. I especially liked Natalie Portman's small role. There are some things that could have been done better. It seems so strange the two main characters would miss each other so much after such a short time together. It didn't seem believeable. I also hated the ending, but I suppose that couldn't be changed from the book. Overall, this is still a good movie."
2,"well made, but tedious","This is one of those movies that I enjoyed as long as I had the fast forward button under my thumb. This is a nicely filmed, well acted movie, but it is also very long and quite boring at times. Kidman is always nice to look at, Zellwegger had an interesting performance, and Law was credible as a soldier. The ending was also not the usual Hollywood happy ending, which I found refreshing if not a little depressing. If you feel like a quiet, slow paced movie then by all means rent this. It is certainly not worth purchasing since I could not imagine sitting through it again-Kidman nudity notwithstanding."
3,Ending Doesn't Fit with Book!,"What can I say? This movie was excellent up until the ending, which ruined for me and a lot of friends and aquaintances I talked with concerning it... Right from the get go, it had me! I felt the acting, cinematography and everything was outstanding, even the story. I will keep this short, because the movie doesn't deserve much after it's horrid ending, which totally destroys the entire story. The ending is kind of like ripping the frame (foundation) out of a house, while thinking it won't crumble! Definitely worth seeing, but just once; if you like sad and boring (over done and cliche) endings you'll love it..."
3,Not Great; Not Bad,"THE PLUSES: gorgeous film; stunning period depictions; several interesting scenes.THE MINUSES: stomach turning violence (beginning to end); a little light on plot and character development for a movie over 2 hours long.THE VERDICT: If there's a particualar reason why this movie interest you -- then by all means go see it (particular reasons might include: you like one of the stars in the movie; you like the civil war; you find the story appealing; it was starting when you showed up at the theatre). Otherwise, don't sweat it and go see something else."
5,beautiful movie,"Cold Mountain is lovely movie. It starts with a man who is in love with a young lady, but not man enough to say it. The young lady try's to reach out to him, but he pushes her away. Before he leaves to war they have their first kiss, which was also a good bye kiss. She writes him many times while he is gone. After being shot he is in the hospital getting better. He ask a stranger to read the last letter his love at Cold Mountain sent him. Her last words asking him to go home to her made him leave the hospital, with no word of his leaving, and head home to Cold Mountain. The journey home is a long trip. A lot happens around him and to him on the way. His love at the same time is still writing him and going threw some up and downs in her life. Wishing he would go home to her. The end is sad but beautiful because he made it home to her. This is a great movie to watch with your loved one. Like I did. Or on a nice winter day/night."
1,I really didn't like this movie,"I expected ""Cold Mountain"" to live up to all the reviews and the fact that it was nominated for an Academy Award. I was very disappointed. Nicole Kidman couldn't act her way out of a paper bag although her hair was beautiful at all times. Jude Law had about a dozen lines to say and the rest of the time he spent looking anguished. Oh, but he DID walk a long way I guess. I would probably look anguished, too. The only saving grace in this film was Renee Z. But even she could not oversome the self-importance and just plain boringness of this production. I wish I could get my money back."
2,SO SLOW,"I watched this movie to the last minute, thinking it would get really good soon. The show left me waiting until the very end when its' ending took place. The ending was very unsatisfactory especially for those of us who like ""happily ever after"" endings.I am sorry, but I have learned if it is nominated for an Oscar, generally I will not like it, especially in today's movies. Thank God this was not always true!"
2,A Sure Cure For Insomnia,"I WATCHED this movie for three reasons: 1) I'm from North Carolina, 2) I love movies based on or around the great wars involving our country, 3) Giovanni Ribisi had a small role in the movie.I HATED this movie for 3 reasons: 1) Long, 2) Boring, 3) Giovanni's role was TOO small and I was totally unimpressed with the character he played.There is good news. As disappointed as I was in the movie in general, Renee Zellweger (whom I've never been overly fond of) saves the picture. Had it not been for her character, I would have fallen asleep much sooner and would have probably not even bothered wasting my time to write this review at all.If you're interested in a real war movie, buy Saving Private Ryan instead. This one just doesn't cut it. Highly over-rated."
1,boring,"i really thought this show would be good but it is so slow and the only part i like was when renee zellweger came in she was the only one made the show worth watching maybe if they would have gotten another leading actress it would have been better but nicole kidman can not act.then that made the leading man look bad but not that jude law is bad by any any means but she ruined the whole show don""t waste your time or money"
2,COULD HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT BUT--------------,"Not much to say - excellent acting - story great except for him dying after finally getting home.So much skin on view was not needed [should just have been implied] ruined the whole movie [and she didn't even end up pregnant?] -- will definitely NOT keep.definitely disappointed - did definitely portray the brutalitly of war - but that is the nature of the beast -- pride, greed, corruption always leads to death [especially so many innocent lives are ruined]"
1,Very depressing,"Horribly sad, and in the end, just downright depressing. I have not seen a movie that made me feel this emotionally drained in a long time. I liked Renee Zellwegger, she deserved that Oscar, but otherwise I just sobbed like a baby through most of it."
4,Very Moving,This movie is very graphic in its violence and depiction of the Civil War battle in the crater. My only complaint is that American Civil War Units were not used to film this part of the film. It is portrayal of the women left behind to survive that is so moving. Their struggle to survive while waiting word from their loved ones is truly something to remember. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman show us what wonderful actors they have become. But I must say that Renee Zellweger steals every scene she appears in.
2,Depressed,"This movie was very long and very depressing. I think I cried for half of the movie. It seemed to be billed as a Civil War movie but, it was less like a Civil War movie than Gone with the Wind. This movie was a love story and a very tortured one at that. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it!"
3,how the hell did they choose Ada?,"I just saw this less than an hour ago, and am disgusted by the poor casting job the director did when searching for a suitable female lead. Why did they have to settle for Nicole Kidman? Her Southern accent is so pitiful, it sounds as if she spent two days working on it, then decided it was good enough. There is actually one line (""I'll go and look for food."") where her actual British/Australian accent comes out! There are a few more phrases where this happens, but that was the most noticeable. I tried to put this lack of a soft Southern drawl down to the manner of speech in her supposed place of birth, Charleston, an urban setting, but still, this is disgraceful. Why the three stars, then? Those are for Jude Law, Rene Zelweger, and the supporting cast. They were all excelent."
3,The English Patient Joins the Civil War !!,"If you liked The English Patient (also directed by Anthony Minghella) you may also like Cold Mountain, similarities in directing styles are apparent between the two movies (the use of flashbacks etc.). But just I was not impressed with the English Patient, I was also not impressed with Cold Mountain. While Cold Mountain's filming and production qualities are very professional and quite good, the acting performances (except for Jude Law) are average and the story line is uneven and often quite slow. By the end of the movie I was wishing Inman would hurry up and get home so I could go home. Cold Mountain has already received considerable attention by earning several Golden Globe nominations (and no doubt it will get several Oscar nominations too). But buyer beware, Cold Mountain is similar to other movies like Chariots of Fire, The Piano, and Shakespeare in Love (only not as good). It will win awards and leave us scratching our heads wondering how and why ??"
2,TORTURE,I can't believe I wasted 154 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie! Unbelievably predicatable story-line and boring charaters. Mocking Renee's impersonation of the son from King of the Hill was the only entertainmet!
2,TOO LONG,"It was good up to a point...but then it just went on and on and on and got to be pretentious and all-suffering, in the same way that ""The English Patient Was."" DIE ALREADY, Elaine called out from the audience in that ""Seinfeld"" episode. And by the way, for a southern Civil War epic...where were all the black people? One more note to filmmakers: you do not need to keep Nicole Kidman in full makeup and perfectly styled hair when she is supposedly starving."
2,A reflection on our rich past,"I like Nichole Kidman and Renee Zellweger so I thought it would be entertaining. The violence was tolerable but when ""hollywood"" threw in a disgusting orgy scene, that was too much. It left me feeling very disappointed on what could have been a good movie on the tenacity of human nature for survival during the American Civil War. The scenery was good. Jude Law was also miscast for the love of Nichole."
4,A Blue Christmas...,"Saw COLD MOUNTAIN last weekend. And - dang if it didn't stick as close as a movie can to the book itself. I was mighty impressed.Everyone did a lovely job - although the chemistry between Kidman and Law was ... watery. Renee Zellweger was astonishing as Ruby. And my favorite surprise was recognizing Kathy Baker as a woman who loses everything. The same Kathy Baker who plays the seductress neighbor in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. She was painfully beautiful in her role in COLD MOUNTAIN. Oh - and until I read the credits, I didn't even realize Natalie Portman was in the mix.Anyway ... definitely not the feel-good hit o' the winter, but still watch-worthy."
2,"Read the book, skip the movie!","Charles Frazier's book is a masterpiece and his love of the time and area of the country (Civil War & Blue Ridge/Appalachian Mtns)show on every page. For some inexplicable reason Anthony Minghella chose to change the most basic parts of the novel to fit Hollywood's expectations and pocketbooks. Nicole Kidman shows no emotion, heck she goes thru the entire movie with barely a hair out of place! Renee Zellwenger is better, but I did not see the need to put her in that part when there are so many talented black actresses that could have done as well or better (if you've read the book you will understand). Jude Law is the only main part that comes close to understanding and relating to the novel. Excellent acting. Only a fair movie, very disappointing."
2,Realism? Huh?,"I watched the film and didn't believe a bit of it. Three wildly-beautiful people in a film about the Old South in the Civil War? Nonsense.The actors are too winning to be real- we need ugly ones or at least no-so-good loking ones to be character actors. People like Robert Duvall; not so good looking, but he can act.Mingella loves glamor, loves scope- but this was the wrong subject, wrong time, and definitly the wrong place in history. Stick to the 1950's Jazz scene, Tony."
4,A MAN'S JOURNEY HOME.....,"""Cold Mountain"" was a fine, albeit slow, drama of a man returning home from the blooded widowing fields of the Civil War. The film version promises to offer a good story, and loads of action. I cannot wait to see the battle of the Crater, which I am told is going to make the opening Omaha Beach sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" look tame! I don't expect it to be as good as Ron Maxwell's critically maligned but superb historical epic ""Gods and Generals,"" but I know it will at least be a movie worth going to see. Let's see who wins the box-office showdown between ""Cold Mountain"" and ""the Alamo."""
1,Not Worth Seeing!,It was very hard to sit through....not interesting at all....my family and I all hated it!!! I expected more from it.
3,"Epic, Romantic, Historic... but too violent for my taste.","Gals, it will be easier than you think to drag your boyfriend to this movie.Although you may be sorry you did if you are expecting more romance than blood.It is not the chick flick I expected based on the trailer (obviously, I haven't read the novel).To get the guys to go, point out that:* Nicole Kidman shows a bit of flesh* There is, flat out, a lot of blood.* Torture, rape, executions, explosions... blood from every angle.I suspect the Civil War atrocities are accurate (perhaps someone else knows) -- and, if so, there is probably historical value in many of these scenes.However, to me this story felt like 60% bloodshed, 20% mournfull sadness, and 10% romantic epic.Not my cup of tea... but I think others will probably enjoy it."
3,Ok not brilliant,"This film started off on the right track but quickly became rather melodramatic and boring. I didn't feel any sympathy for nicole kidman's character because frankly, and I know this will upset some people, I just don't think she is that good of an actress. She was flat and had no emotion whatsoever. Jude Law was a little better but not by much. I think the main stars were overshadowed by the minor actors in the movie. I thought Natalie Portman was excellent in this movie as the single mother alone in the woods. Philip Hoffman was extremely funny as the randy minister jude law picked up on the way. I think there were good scenes in the movie but it was too long and lacked emotion."
5,not just a love story,"I read these reviews before I saw the movie, and one reviewer mentioned that the movie was haunting. That is true, I find myself still thinking about it after several days. Several reviewers mentioned the difficulty in believing the love story because Ada and Inman ""barely knew each other."" That might be because the characters themselves both mention how few words have passed between them. We have no trouble believing in the ""love"" of other movie couples who have one scene and jump into bed, why shouldn't we believe Ada and Inman? People have clung to less to get them through trials. Anyway, this movie had so much more to say-about the friendship between women, the relationships of fathers and daughters, the kindness of strangers. And perhaps most important, the pain and destruction caused by war, no matter how necessary that war may be. And the music was incredible, I bought the soundtrack and keep listening to it. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie."
2,Not worth the time.,"I saw this movie for the first time today and I didn't really care for it. I was bored through most of it and depressed at the end. It was really long, too long..they could have made it shorter with all the parts that mattered. There is beautiful scenery and wonderful actors/actresses, but that's just not enough to save this movie. I wouldn't recommend buying this or renting it. That is, unless you have insomnia."
3,A Bit Cliched,"Typical Civil War romance built around the conceit that a rebel soldier would desert and then traipse through hell to get back to a woman he kissed once and barely knew before he headed off to war. The film would have you believe that's all the motive Jude Law needed. Times sure must have been a lot more innocent back in 1864. Of course, the soldier finally makes it back more than two hours later, only to die in his lover's arms when shot by some Confederate vigilantes. Nicole Kidman's accent is pretty funny: Aussie tries to sound Southern. Didn't work. Renee Zellweger's part is well done as is Philip Seymour Hoffman's. The battle sequences are pretty realistic, I guess. I didn't fight in the Civil War, though. All in all, quite overrated Hollywood hokum, as usual. Too long, too. But worth a rent or a library borrow."
2,Left me Cold,"I have an appreciation for great films - but although I loved the scenery and story line I felt it was completely ruined by the graphic sexual scenes. When I bought this, my copy said PG by mistake. It is a strong R rating. I don't feel it has much to watch except the superb performance by Renee Zelwegger. I don't recommend it and I love most period pieces."
4,Love & War,"I am really hesitant in going to watch war movies. I have seem too many. So, I was hesitant to go and see this one. However, I heard the movie was good and that there was the ""love"" element in it which my wife would like. We went to see it and we weren't disappointed. This movie has some very explicit sexual scenes which we don't think were necessary (a minister with a lady) but that's hollywood. I loved the music, it was different and creative. We found it soo ironic that the main character survives soo much (the war, the journey home) and dies very tragically right after being reunited with her lover."
3,Watch the second half,"The first half of this movie was uneventful in terms of moving the storyline. While I think Nicole Kidman is a good actress and Jude Law is handsome to look at, not much was going on in the movie. The second half of it got considerably better, right around the time that Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwegger's character) showed up. I think Ruby really stole the show, the movie became a great deal more interesting and relatable with her in it. Renee Zellwegger won the best supporting actress academy award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes and I think it was well-deserved.Other than that, there were so many ways they could have made a Civil War movie more entertaining."
3,Love story this ain't,"Loved the book. I got the unabridged audio tapes and listened to it before seeing the movie on DVD.Gruesome and violent, it definately makes you hate some of the characters but does very little to endear you to the main characters of the story.Unfortunately in the movie the love story was just about non-existant. A glimpse, a stolen moment and a glass of water does not equal the epic love story of all ages.The scenery of the movie was excellent and really is what saved this movie from being 1 or 2 stars. If they could have given an oscar for best actor to the background, this should have been nominated.This is the kind of movie you go see if you liked the horse whisperer or brave heart and you thought to yourself ""I'd love to go see where they shot that film!"""
5,What a great movie!,"This movie is full of action, love, great views, actors, and everything else a movie needs to be great. Having said that, the only word to describe a movie such as this one is SPECTACULAR!"
3,One scene especially memorable,"The early battle scene is the most gut-wrenching image of war that I have seen on film. Its darkness, claustrophobia, savagery, hopelessness, desperation is only heightened by the background music: the shape-note singing of Idumea, an American religious chant at once ecstatic, popular and primitive. And the knowledge that these are Americans killing one another gives chilling irony to the words ""civil war"". My stomach still hurts. A moment when art makes horror almost beautiful."
3,Pretty Good Film,"I was not very impressed with this film and it is certainly not one of my favorites for the year. The acting was fine,although it was a bit strange to see Kidman in make-up that rivaled what she ordinarily wears for an award ceremony. The music was great and the period pieces were a highlight of the movie. One very unpleasant part of the film was that the majority of the characters seemed to be sociopathic, bloodthirsty, and crude. The film also tries a little too hard to be ""EPIC"" and barely achieves satisfying. The cimematography is excellent and the scenery breathtaking. Overall, good but not great. Just too heavy-handed, overblown, and signifying little."
2,Cold Mountain too cold for me!,I gave Cold Mountain two stars because of the acting and cinematography. I have not read the book- nor will I! This movie had bad thing after bad thing which left me wishing I had gone to see a romantic comedy or such to make me feel better not worse. Realizing that the movie depicted life as it was during Civil War time - it just isn't something I need to see now. Way too violent and COLD. I almost left a number of times but kept thinking it would get better. The ending didn't wipe the bad away either! Love story not worth the agony to me.
1,"Can you say ""Ho Hum"".","This is one of the most boring films I've seen in a while! It's very stupid too. I can't believe it was nominated for an academy award. I mean really, COME ON!"
3,Cold Mountain,Gratuitous gore.Excessively melodramatic.An attempt as a 'Gone With The Wind' contemporary production.This is so done.Rene is excellent.Kidman and Law are average.
1,The 1 Star is for the 1 Good Battle Scene at the Begining,"Other than that this film should have been called ""Long Mountain"". It's boring. It's anti-climactic. It's even campy at times (Rene Zellweger). Speaking of Rene her boyfriend, overrated musician Jack White or something like that is terrible in it. I didn't recognize him when I watched the film because he looks fat in it but I did immediately think that he was some rocker of the moment. He looks as out of place in a film as Russell Crowe looks and sounds in a band. Don't see this film and you won't be missing anything. Unless you want to fall asleep and you are tired of counting sheep."
1,Renee Sucks,Renee Zellweger is the least talented actress I have ever seen. This movie is horrible because she is in it. She ruins every movie she is in. This silly movie should win a hundred Razzies. Many people call it an 'epic'. No way is a movie like an epic. Renee zellweger is horrible in this.
3,No Gone With The Wind,"I found this movie interesting but notoutstanding for all of the hipe and previews of it. Perhaps I expect all expensive Civil War movies to be the caliber of Gone With The Wind. I found Nicole Kiddman too demire and sweet for the role of Ada. I thought the plot was shallow and failed to recognize a great passionate romance here that was overshadowed by violence. Basically, as a Civil War buff, Ruby (Renee Zellweger) kept me awake on this one. I was expecting strong acting and this movie fell short. I was disappointed that it was not actually filmed in the beautiful Mts. of North Carolina. It was an okay movie, but I would not buy the video for my collection."
3,Could Have Been Better,"Both Renée Zellweger and Jude Law give outstanding performances in this movie. However, I felt Nicole Kidman was just awful. The movie takes place during the civil war, and Nicole looks like she just walked out of a spa in Beverly Hills. I also felt Natalie Portman was mis-cast in her role.I agree with the other reviews I read that people say the nudity was excessive and unnecessary. The director could have shown the love scene with a much lighter hand, and the point would have come across alot better. It wasn't as romantic as it should have been, the nudity was to obvious.Regardless, Renee is wonderful, and is definately worthy of her Oscar nomnation. Even being in a film that was not that well done, she gives a performance 100% better than anyone else in the cast. Jude Law is also outstanding, as a man who is running away from the Civil War.Also, this is a movie about the American Civil War. The studio shot in in a foreign country just to save money .... very tacky."
2,Highly over rated and boring,"After all the hype about this movie, I was expecting so much more than was delivered. I found it to be boring, too long and lacking in any cohesive plot."
1,How Could they Release this Travesty?,Just a few words. Hollywood scorched a perfectly good piece of fiction.I left at the end utterly dismayed at the way Frazier's efforts wwre handled.
2,Wet Week,"This was visually OK but overlong and not remarkable. As an australian I should be prejudiced but have to say Nicole Kidman overrated. I own this movie but would not sit through it again. One to ten, ten being best, give this one four."
3,Let on the Mountain,"This 'Civil War' tale can boast star attraction.With Nicole Kidman delivering an outstanding perfomance, and great performances by Renee Zellweger and Jude Law.The storyline should be appealing, though I personally did not get drawn into the movie."
2,A dud!,"I love the movie Gettysburg, but couldn't stand this movie. The trailer sold it as a romance between Nicole Kidman's patrician character and Jude Law's humble character, but the movie features violent scene after violent scene. The violence is not on the battlefield, but between those who remain in town and prey on women left on isolated homesteads, and those hunting down deserters from the army to kill them. I wouldn't have minded violent battle scenes, but the rape and torture of townspeople seemed gratuitous. There are better movies out there to see."
3,COLD AND DEPRESSING,"I am a huge fan of Anthony Mingella's movies, I loved The Talented Mr. Riply and I liked The English Patient, though it was hella long, but this film was harder to like. The story is a good one and the book by Frazier is very good, but in its movie form it seems really depressing. I thought Kidman was very good and Zellweger was great, but I really did not like Law as Inman, he just did not register, it was hard to understand why Kidman longed for him so. The movie is extremely violent, in a Deliverance sort of way, the violence is real and disturbing, one scene in particular is just retching to watch, if you see this film you will know exactly what I am refering to, overall the quality of the film is very good and the cinematography is outstanding, it amazing how much Romania looks like North Carolina, I do recommend this film, but be forewarned it is depressing and hard to watch at times....enjoy."
4,Cold Mountain - 002-5800950-9292055,"Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand."
5,Perfect!,"This movie is just perfect, it has everythng a good movie needs and it fully delivers a powerfull lesson about life. It shoul not be missed."
2,Hollywoodized American History,"Disney could have done a better job. Unbelievable that a movie about the pivotal events in American history wasn't made in America or had an American cast. Civil War reenactors work for free and the real Cold Mountain is in North Carolina. The accents, especially Nicole Kidman's, are atrocious. The script itself was sanitized to make it politically correct (the whole war is about slavery) and Inman is quoted as saying he doesn't believe in the war. (Not in the book) Very poor job. Read the book, skip the movie"
5,Beautiful!,"This movie is just a great movie! I've read other reviews about this movie and can't believe how horrible some of the reviews are because this movie never fails to move me. The imagery is wonderful and the soundtrack is amazing! Yes the instant love between the two main characters does seem to lack quality but it is even admitted between the two that they don't even know each other. I just love the imagery, drama, and music in this movie and watch it at least once every 6 months."
1,"Cold Mountain about us, but not","Horrible. That is the only word I can think of for this movie. If you have read the book, you will be greatly disappointed in this movie. The book was a dynamic tale of the human history/viewpoint of OUR civil war, yet the movie was filmed in Poland, with an Australian actress and an English actor. Jude Law was very good in his part as was Renee Zellwigger (sp.). Unfortunately, these two could not carry the movie. Although I have loved Nicole Kidman in other films, she was pretty lousy in this...no magnetism between her and Jude Law."
1,zellweger nauseates,"I had high expectations for this movie and was thoroughly disappointed especially with zellweger's performance (who i usually love)as she was over the top and nauseating with an accent which grated on my nerves. The message throughout the movie of 'war is bad' was repeated about a million times and there was no subtlety. Characters seemed to appear out of nowhere with no explanation and many seemed to have no purpose, I don't know if the book is any better but I have been put off even approaching it."
1,"Right story, wrong movie","Boring. Boring. Boring. Read the book. Better yet listen to the book on tape, read by the author. Therein lies the real story...I think Nicole Kidman is one of the best actors today, but not in this film."
3,Civil War Replicants,"I don't think I've ever met any real human beings with as many eccentric mannerisms, facial expressions, tics and affectations as those exhibited by the three leads in this film. Perhaps that's just how people acted back during the Civil War. And maybe lovers in those days all spoke in that odd, hesitant style, with plenty of sidelong glances and.....dramatic pauses! Then again, maybe not. In spite of all that, I was still drawn into the story itself and the beautiful cinematography. But this is no 'English Patient'..."
5,"Ulysses, circa 1864","There is probably a more closely related story in anceint Greek liturature to compare this to but I'll stick with Ulysses as being close enough (the well business in the DVD really ties it in to the old stories).The producers did a nice job of depicting the starved, sick (tuberculosis), poorly clothed people of the war torn south except for their bright Hollywood dental work. The period music is a lot of fun too (and I'm uncomfortable with the realization that most of it is somewhere in my CD collection in more modern versions).Having read ""Rebel Private: Front and Rear : Memoirs of a Confederate Soldier"" by William A. Fletcher, Richard Wheeler also did a lot to help this movie come alive. In fact I was surprised not to see a reference to the book in the closing credits of the DVD, but I didn't get to the second disc yet."
1,"If you like BLOOD, you will like this movie!","I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and I probably would have liked it if I could see beyond the blood and guts. Throughout the entire film, the producers had to show every bit of blood. I was expecting a romance about a man trying to get home to his sweetheart in the civil war, but instead got: men coughing and gagging up blood, men swimming through lakes of blood, men frozen to death with blood hardened on their face, and nasty cuts, injuries, shots, and sicknesses.This movie is definetly not suitable for children."
5,cold mountain,Ice seen thus movie probly six or more times. All characters were well portrayed... Excellent movie with a shocking ending...one of my favorites
2,Close your eyes on two scenes...,"I was excited about watching this film seeing how it got high reviews but there were two scenes in it that were totally uncalled for. The ""sex scenes"" or in my opinion ""soft core porn"" should have been omitted. It took away from the movie completely. I had NO idea these scenes were in this movie. There is also a lot of killing but then again it is based during the Civil War, which made the movie very dark. The acting was, in my opinion, superb that's why I continued to watch the movie. I agree with another review Nicole's face looked so tight. Almost as if she just left her plastic surgeon."
2,Much hype for .....???,"This movie got great reviews initially, and you'd expect a good movie from a great cast, but what the heck happened here? The pace of this movie was VERY slow and you end up waiting for it to be over for two hours. Save your money and wait until it's on DVD."
1,A Mountain of Crap,"In which Nicole Kidman defends her home against cartoon villains and Renee ""Look at me, I'm ACTING"" Zelwegger's performance, while Jude Law wanders the wilderness and meets eccentric people (including an old woman who bears a suspicious resemblance to Clint Eastwood in drag).During the way, the movie pauses to explicitly note that one of the reasons Nicole is struggling so to keep the old homestead running is that she SET HER SLAVES FREE as soon as her Daddy the preacherman died (and of course the script never refers to them as ""slaves"", but as ""negroes"" or ""coloreds""), because of course she is a GOOD Confederate, you can't have your major motion picture stars whipping the darkies behind the barn, now can you?"
2,Very disappointed,"Anthony Minghella's The English Patient is still one of my favourite movies of all time, and I was eager to see his new film on the same subject.I was VERY disappointed. During the entire film I couldn't help thinking, is it a fake or what? It can't be Mingella's movie! To me, all it does is tries to pretend it's the same kind of movie as The English Patient, with similar storytelling and moments that I can clearly see as 'emotional climax triggers'.But whereas I almost cried each time I saw the latest Swimmers' Cave episode for the first 15 times watching the English Patient, I had not a single moment of emotional agitation during Cold Mountain.Very disappointed..."
1,"Poor excuse for a move, too cold to watch.","Thisi s a poor excuse for a movie. While this flick has some good historic civial war imagery, they're all a bunch of sad moments that make this movie too cold to watch. There is a very shallow story in here despite all of this, its a love story between Jude Law's character and Nicole Kidman's characters who fall inlove but ever truly get to know each other, what makes this worse is tht Law's character dies at the end. This movie drags on and on with sad moments and tells no real story. Despite all of this, the action scenes are good, but they don't make this movie any better. This movie is too cold for its own good, skip it.3.5/10"
2,Dull until the end.,"The movie itself was really dull until the final shoot out between the good guys and gals, and the bad guys. Zellweger is the only lively character on Cold Mountain. Everyone else is stale and some are down right nasty.If you really liked this film then you'll probably like the DVD package. It has all the bells and whistles a DVD has to offer."
1,"Whiny, godawful disjointed waste of celluloid","Cold Mountain never got off the ground. Its largest problem is the failure of any of its actors to emote, however, given the fact that all of their characters are nothing but ciphers, that's to be expected.We never find out anything about their characters and as a result it's almost impossible to identify with any of them. The Renee character is so much of a country stereotype that we almost expect a banjo riff whenever she appears onscreen. The script also lacks three acts, as the movie is just a collection of short events.None of these events are particularly exciting, and when coupled with the other writing problems, you end up with a film that has you checking your watch over and over again.Now on to some good things: it's shot well. The photography is ok, but that's unfortunately all the positive things this film has going for it. There are far better romantic movies out there for you to see."
1,Disappointing,"This is what ruined it for me: Nicole Kidman looks like she stepped out of Vogue magazine in every single scene. Everyone else looks appropriate for the period, but there's Nicole: supposedly broke, hungry, and attempting to manage on a farm when she has no skills, looking utterly ravishing while everyone else has leaves & twigs stuck in their hair. Poor Rene Zellweger looks like a mac-truck ran over her, having to play opposite Nicole with her ruby-red lips and perfectly coiffed hair. Unbelievable.I think we've become so immune to bad film-making that we'll settle for anything, especially if its packaged as a costume drama. This film contained scene after scene of purely gratuitous violence that served no purpose other than to titillate the audience. The predicaments in which Jude Law's character find himself reminded me of The Canturbury Tales - it was almost comical, it was so ridiculous. Crappy movie."
4,Homage or plagarism,I was amazed to see the death scene from Dangerous Liasions redone in Cold Mountain. It was a wonderful shot once...the first time!
1,"i thought anthony minghella was incapable of making a worse movie than ""the english patient"" ...","oops, mine bad!"
1,History it is not,"Home Gaurd units were typically made up of the old men and young teenagers of a community. Research finds the descendants of the Home Gaurd units (depicted as brutes and savages in the film) still living there and able to provide evidence of yet another anti-South Hollywood twist. Yes, yes there is the usual dribble about the South fighting for slaves, though fully 85% owned none. Throw in gratuitous violence and a plotless story with the predictable historical flaws and you have wasted $8. Want an overwraught love-story and this will do. Want history? Gods and Generals is still your best bet."
1,ANOTHER POLITICAL PIECE,"Cold Mountain seemed to have a good start with some great footage of what Civil War trench warfare might have been like. After about five minutes, though, you could predict the outcome which really dragged on. What was personally offensive to me was the depiction of a pastor as a drunk, womanizing hypocrite. While I'm certain that there have been a few of these in history, I have to wonder why Hollywood always depicts them this way?. My question is why we don't ever see a Rabbi being ridiculed?Other problems with the movie include the accents of Nicole and Rene which are almost impossible to understand. Also, the Southern men of this era were raised to be gentlemen. The bloodthirsty killers of Southern Army deserters are difficult to believe. This movie should not be rented or bought. It is poorly written and directed."
3,Great except...,I thought the movie was a great portayal of what the family goes through during a war and their loved ones are off fighting not knowing what is happening to them. This gives a inclination of what the family went through and the horrors they had to endure.This movie could have gone without the x-rated scenes. The inclination of what was about to happen would have had a lot more meaning to the story than the actual showing of the explicts during the love scene as well as the prostitute scene.Renee was amazing and very much deserved her awards.
2,An Exercise In Brutality To What End?,"I gave this film two stars, one for Kidman the other for Zellwigger, as for the story itself the brutality of Inman's odysseian journey back to Ada overwhelms their unbelievable romantic attachment to each other. Director Minghella fails utterly in making their love come convincingly to life in the way David Lean did with Yuri and Lara in ""Dr Zhivago"", so the viewer is subjected to one horrific episode of brutality after another without the reward of genuine fulfillment at the end, and ironically it is Ada who lures Inman into his journey of ultimate self-destruction with her letter pleading with him to desert and come back to her. At the conclusion I felt only revulsion at the detailed portrayal of the brutalities and emptiness for Ada and Inman."
2,Don't listen to the Grammies!!!!!!!,"It would be unfair to say that the Grammies award winners never don't or never deserved their awards. But seriously, pretty much EVERY time I hear the winners I get disappointed. From all the years of noticing the Grammies, I notice that they like to stick to ""old"" stuff and style of music. I mean, U2???? haven't they won like EVERY single time???? Same goes to Mariah Carey.Rest they go for popularity. period.Kelly Clarkson DOES NOT DESERVE her award, at least not for Since you've been gone- that one sound just like ANY other rock-pop artists who are very likely to use technology to make their voice pitch-perfect. Kelly Clarkson has a very very nice voice that I admit, and she probably deserve a Grammy, just not that song.Beware of the Grammies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Can't Get Worse,This CD shows how music is bad. No good artists at ALL. What about Cyndi Lauper THE BODY ACOUSTIC? And some other good ones. This CD is terrible. Don't buy it...
1,Must be a JOKE!,"One of the work records of the year. Bad singers, bad voices and the songs are not that great. The GRAMMYS should rethink its legacy. Good records, good singers and great songs are out. Disapointed..."
2,This CD could have been way better!,This CD Sucks. I mean Bruce Springstein is such a has been. Dude retire please! U2 also another has been group. I think someone needs to revamp the Grammy nominations and choose some really great music. Ya know songs that will last forever and never grow old!!!
1,The wallpaper of our lives,"A lot of the same old suspects, all these ""various artists"" but no Deep Purple once again. Purple's 2005 album, ""Rapture of the Deep"" has sold close to a million. Why? Because it's a great disc. But no Grammy nomination?!Of course there are some worthy choices here, Green Day, Paul McCartney, Kelly Clarkson and The Rolling Stones for example. But even the new Stones album can't hold a candle to ""Rapture of the Deep.""And what about U2? What a pitiful album for such talented artists and why a grammy nomination? Let's all face it, they're simply part of the wallpaper of our lives. That's right, just keep jamming it down our throat. No wonder the ""music biz"" is going down the tubes.Buyer beware."
1,this was a worst grammy compilation n u should not buy this cd's!!!!!,I'm so suprised that this year song n album of the year awards goes to U2!!!! It's so unfair!!!! U2 are not deserves to won this 2 key awards!!!! They songz are so terrible n i always switch off my radio when i heard their songz!!!! This is a bad awards ever!!!! this year grammy was so horrible n u will regret if u buy this cd's!!!! It's a bad compilation cd's ever in music industry!!!! I hate U2 U2 U2 U2 U2!!!!
1,worst compilation cd's ever!!!,this is a worst compilation cd's !!!! n this year grammy was unfair too!!! How come U2 can win the album of the year!!! their album was so terrible!!!! U2 sucks!!!!
1,this was a worst grammy cd's,i'm so suprised that this year record of the year n album of the year awards goes to U2!!!! They're not deserves 2 won the key awards!!!! U2 songz ar so horrible n i always close my radio when i heard their song!!!! It's juz like a nightmare for everyone who likes music!!! This year grammy was so terrible even the cd's!!!!
2,there's no good reason key songs should be missing. what where they thinking when they put this compilation together!!!!!,"the first and most notable song missing is kanye west's ""gold digger"". just don't understand that one. mariah's ""we belong together"" should be here instead of it's like that. WBT spent weeks of being #1 and again theres no reason for this to be happening. 50 cent's ""candy shop"" or ""just a lil bit""(better off just a lil bit)is missing also. that suprised me. black eyed peas ""don't phunk with my heart"" or ""my humps"". gwen stefani's ""hollaback girl"". kelly clarkson ""because of you"" should be here instead of since you been gone. there are just a few other's missing that i can't think of at the moment. this was'nt really smart who ever put this thing together, to just forget all the above. make your own grammy 2006 cd because strategic marketing could'nt get the job done."
2,I'm sorry... I thought this would reflect the Grammy nominated selections...,"... but it doesn't. They're putting up ""It's Like That"" instead of the one song that stayed a record-breaking, unheard of fourteen week stay at number one on the singles chart by the same artist titled ""We Belong Together""? They're exiling the group that enlisted ""humps"" into daily vocabulary? They're substituting ""Because of You"" for ""Since U Been Gone""? This is really a laughable effort to bank on the actual event that takes place in February. Let me guess... they're going to call Kanye a martyr next? Please..."
1,no gold digger? no thanks,to include mccartney and not kanye is too big a flaw to overcome.the jay z/lincoln park mash is not present either. why?rob thomas? rascal flatts? where is alison krauss & union station?not worth it.
2,Not a very thrilling thriller,"In 1968 Charles Sommerville, son of the impoverished landowner Philip Sommerville, is on the run from drug dealers in the Welsh Borders. At the same time in nearby Llantrisillio, James and Suzie, newcomers to that part of England, find their sylvan idyll brutally and shockingly shattered by the voyeurism of a farming neighbour... Also in Border country, in Birmingham, policeman John Munroe is liaising with his Welsh colleagues on a routine enquiry. But a mysterious death in the area draws him inexorably into an investigation which is to uncover a tangle of dangerous passions running beneath the outwardly calm rural scene. This book unfortunately features a poorly designed plot - to the point of becoming almost unbelievable - as well as an unskilful characterisation."
2,"Great recipes, needed double-checking","Mr. Flay has some great recipes in here. The combination of ingredients sure makes some delicious food. I've done a handful of these, however, and it seems to me the translation from his mind to the page resulted in some odd results.We made Steak Frites with Blue Cheese sauce. There was enough resulting Blue Cheese sauce to accompany a dozen steaks, let alone four. I made his candied mango butter (serving size in the book: 4) and halved the recipe for two and have over half of it left. One recipe calls for Shrimp stock - six cups. The recipe for Shrimp stock shows it makes FIVE cups. COME ON! By the bye, who has 3 POUNDS of shrimp shells around for this?Perhaps I'm too amateur but do keep a close eye on these recipes. I followed many unquestionably and had some gripes."
2,Not as advertised,"This is the first review I have ever written about anything. I puchased the Mesa Grill Cookbook being no stranger to southwest cooking. It's my specialaty. I have tried a total of 5 recipes in this book and NONE of them came out according to the directions. I've never seen anything like it. Cooking times are incorrect, some of the methods are questionable. Even as I sit here and write this, I am RE-roasting my cauliflower becuase the recipe for the roasted green chili and cauliflower soup called for an odd roasting method that left me with warm/raw cauliflower after the 30 minute cooking time. The Lamb Shanks were outstanding but the sauce needed some extra help and dont even try to make his dulce de leche recipe. I am really disappointed."
5,Delightfully quaint,"It helps to be from Cincy or acquainted with the Queen City.This book was written about 50 years ago. Brings out the bestof a conservative, rightwing, often backward urban metropolis.It is disconcerting to realize Cincy peaked in mid 19th century!"
4,Like this one too!!!!,"I bought this CD along with ""Hands All Over Me"" and ""Overexposed"" also by Maroon 5. It's pretty much a toss up over which one I like the best, but this one ranks right up there. Pretty much I just shuffle between the three of them. In my opinion you really ought to have all three!!!"
3,Sarah's book review of Dar and the Spear Thrower,"Have you ever been through a ceremony ? Have you ever felt doubtful that you couldn't do something like overcome your fears ? In this historical fiction book, Dar and the Spear Thrower by Marjorie Cowley you will find yourself learning to overcome your fears and start to take chances without knowing what the outcome will be.The setting in Dar and the Spear Thrower takes place in Stone Age time in southern France. As the Initiation ceremony draws nearer Dar becomes uneasy about whether or not he will pass the initiation ceremony and become a man because he does not feel that he is skilled at hunting,or making tools. So will Dar ever become a man or will he remain a child forever?I have read many books and this book is definitely worth reading. Not only did it teach me about the Stone Age I felt like I was there and experiencing everything that was happening to Dar."
5,Great Book,What can I say about the authors of this book except great job lol. Holman does a wonderful job putting it together including a back section specifically for law enforcement.
5,Chef Specialties Prentiss Stainless Steel Pepper Mill,"The Chef Specialties Prentiss Stainless Steel Pepper Mill was given as a gift and it certainly makes a statement in the kitchen. At 12 inches high, it clearly stands out on the counter. Plus, it holds a large amount of peppercorns. The mechanism seems to work well although parts of the mill seem a little plastic-like. There is a lifetime warranty on the grinder mechanism, so that shouldn't be too much of a worry. Overall, it works very well and looks great!"
4,art textbook,I am pretty happy with the book I realize that it is used. Glad I was able to get the hard cover book instead of the soft cover I think it will last longer.
2,No Photography!,"By this book, 1940 marked the time that photography died and was replaced by vast amounts of performance art. Can you seriously present a ""survey"" of contemporary art without even acknowledging photography in any form?"
1,Ewwww.......,"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan of contemporary art. That being said, this book is incredibly difficult to read. For me, each sentence took several re-reads before I could get some type of clue as to what he was trying to say. I consider myself a good reader and this book was way out there with the uppity language. My husband would get a kick out of me reading sentences to him, just because they were impossible to understand. If you like this sort of thing, then you might like the book. I, however, did not like the book. I also did not like how they would describe a work of art in great detail, yet show you a totally different piece from that artist. It made if difficult to visually see what they were talking about. My professor did a much better job explaining the material covered in this book."
3,"Interesting, but more philosophy than practice","I agree with the earlier reviewers. This is a very personal account of one man's transition from the traditional darkroom to digital. It concentrates on the effect of that change on the process of making black and white photographs. It is not a ""how-to"" manual, and, after some initial exploration of this transition myself, I don't agree with some of the author's statements about Photoshop and what he did and didn't find useful. A really good ""how-to"" is Amphoto's Guide to Digital Black and White Printing by Schaub."
1,untrustworthy,"The book is full of distorted facts and partial and untruthful analysis. e. g. The author tries to diminish Ilia Chavchavadze's role in Georgian National Identity formation. He writes that during his work as a peace arbitrator and afterwards Chavchvadze's interests turned toward ethnography ""Politically he became more conservative and dedicated himself to his work in the Georgian Nobles' Bank and the society for Spread of Literacy Among Georgians"". Mr. Suny pays no attention to the 12 volumes of Ilia Chavchavafze's articles published in the period of time, material which is the most important in this aspect."
1,Armenian Propaganda,"Unfortunately, the author portrays hismelf not as a scientist searching for answers to the posed questions, but as a propagandist of the flawed theory and intentionally distorted facts. The book contains numerous historical inaccuracies, which are used for flawed extrapolations.Look for alternative resources and volumes."
1,TERRIBLE AND FULL OF MISTRUTHS,"I was horribly disappointed by this book. The author misconstrues the truth to an extreme extent. Sadly, I have noticed that many Georgian propogandists are striving to do this with their own history nowadays. From examples like denying the fact that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are inhabitated by completely different and separate ethnic groups, from twisting data and dates to suit their purposes altogether, I would highly advise anyone looking to read about this region to take this book and others like it with a grain of salt. Stick to credible resources and do your research before you buy such trash."
5,Excellent,"Thinking about where we are in relation to China, and where we are going? You should watch this.Well worth the $2 and hour of your life.I've been a practicing mechanical engineer for ten years, and for the first time since college, did I feel like I learned something important.As I have felt since youth, I hope West and East can learn from each other, and can be open minded for the future."
5,healthy approach towards international history and politics,"This DVD contains a healthy approach towards international history and politics. It places China, its current situation, aims and developments against the background of a colonial history in which the Western powers played a major role. As such it aims to open some narrow minded ideas on China's impact on international economic developments and tries to objectify China as a world player, and not as an enemy of the West."
5,Educational and entertaining at the same time,"China's history is fascinating, and this documentary describes perfectly one of the most interesting moments of this history. Many illustrations, good interventions of experts. This film should definitely be seen by any students learning Chinese History, but also by anyone interested in the origins of what could be the first power in the world tomorrow."
2,It's not his best stand up ever.,"I've always been a Rich Little fan but this one seems a little forced and he forgot quite a few jokes. Also his impressions are getting as old as he is. I give it a grade of ""C""."
5,Rich Little Still the Greatest,This DVD is OUTSTANDING. Laughter is the best medicine and Rich Little gives you plenty in this DVD. Rich Little is still the BEST! His Christmas Carol is also wonderful. I saw his show in Las Vegas - WOW! It was GREAT!
5,Another Oustanding Performance Recorded,"This is another triumph in Sir Colin's Berlioz cycle. Especially noteworthy is Van Allen's interpretation of Brander's ""Song of the Rat."" The cornet and trombone accompaniment to Mephistopheles' ""Voici des Roses"" and the viola and english horn obbligati to Marguerite's romance ""D' amour l'ardente flamme"" are two of many examples of the LSO's incredible playing. I have never heard the Hungarian March played with such verve and precision. The fact that this was an analog recording actually increased my enjoyment, as I have always felt that that mode was better for the blend of the instruments."
4,Good Campy Fun,"This was a made-for-television movie from the 1970's, a take on the tale of Frankenstein. It is a campy version not meant to be the same as the original story. It may not be to the liking of today's horror fans as it is dated and lacks graphic blood and gore. However, if you grew up in the time in which this movie was first shown and you enjoyed the movies of the week, you may actually enjoy it. There is a great cast of well-known actors of the time, including Jane Seymore in one of her first (maybe even first) movie roles. It also stars Micheal Sarrazin, James Mason and Leonard Whiting of Romeo and Juliet fame. Most of the techniques used are more than likely out-dated and it definitely shows it's age, but the movie is still great fun. I had forgotten how much I liked it and it brought back good memories of movies from it's day."
4,A good one.,"It was different compared to other horror movies,,,,,enjoyed it and have also recommended it to others...Would watch it again.And will do so.."
2,Childhood Memories Fail My Adult-self,"The last time I'd seen this was when I was young. Little. Just a kid. And the image of Jane Seymour's head flopping off her shoulders has been etched in my mind since then, a memory that has replayed over and over all those years since. And yeah, that's still in there. And yeah, it's pretty cool. There's not much else for me to like in here though. It's got some atmosphere... some occasionally decent production value... and it certainly isn't hard to see how Jane Seymour was plucked soon after to be a Bond-girl. It's got two stars: one for the kid in me; one for the adult."
3,Frankenstain the True Story,It has George Mason in it. He does a good job. I love the part where the creature ( if you want to call it that = not scary at all folks ) is yammering on about Figero. I laughed at that scene. My Mother likes this movie. Its pretty long and also has Jane ( hot babe ) Seymore as the bride of Frankenstein. Its worth a one time watch. Just not my taste in horror.
2,The only thing scary was the way the novel was trashed.,"Some good actors were wasted on this production. Ironically, the title says, ""The True Story"" when, in fact, there are so many discrepancies with the original novel that it would be difficult to list them all. It's a shame, because there really are some fine actors in this video who deserved a better plot to work with. There are much better movies made from ""Frankenstein"", so unless you have to have them all you should not waste your time with this one."
3,"Not the True Story, But Truly Memorable","Like many reviewers here, I first saw ""Frankenstein: The True Story"" when I was young, and many of the images stayed with me all these years. It was surprisingly dark and graphic for early 70's TV--bodiless limbs, a head being ripped off, a nude woman's body floating in a tank. Watching it again as an adult, I see it's flaws, but it's still a fun, creepy, campy take on the Frankenstein story. James Mason is a hoot as Dr. Polidori. With his smooth voice, nobody could deliver a droll, sarcastic line like him. Jane Seymour is also good as the monster's ""bride."" Her sinister giggle and cruelty toward cats made her a memorable villain. If you've never seen it, it's worth renting. But do skip the opening chapter on the DVD, which shows scenes from the film and gives too much away."
1,THE WORD FOR THIS MOVIE CANNOT BE PRINTED,"Junk food for people who have not read the book nor ever intended to. Put together from scraps of The Hand, Dr. Jeykill and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Tales of Hoffmann (the Olympia episode), and Trilby, held together by the flimsiest veneer of Shelley's story, it even includes a character called Polidori! Zarrazin is simply too beautiful to look ugly even under all the makeup, and the whole enterprise has a decidedly homoerotic component, not surprising, given who wrote the script. Baby boy loves daddy and they both share the same fate. Rent, not buy.AGH! What actors will do to make a living!"
3,Frankienstien - The False Story,"I would call this the toy, soap opera, hair dressers version of Frankenstien. I'm not sure how I found this version of F'stien (recently which led to the purchase of the DVD)- I knew it was the one I had seen at a family party on TV around new years 1974 (?) ....so I must have been 7 years old at the time - certain scenes I recalled - and since that time I had never seen it on TV again - until now the new unedited DVD version!! - I've only watched it once since purchase (7/2007) 'I would call this the toy, soap opera, hair dressers version of Frankenstien' I was surprised to find the cast of familiar actors especially a young and ""beautiful"" Jane Seymour as Agatha and Prima ......the unforgetable scene which looked to be right out of H.P.Lovecrafts ""The Outsider"" - don't worry I won't tell you what happens....genuinely horrorfying in a comical way - as well as some interesting philosophiocal themes, great for a party!"
1,terrible,"Perhaps the longest adaptation of Frankenstein known to man. I think reading the novel would be faster than suffering through this film. The characters are boring the special effects sad, this film has no redeeming qualities. The monster is simply a man that begins to degrade as the film plods along. The end result is a guy with clay on his forehead. Stay away, do yourself a favor cause its terrible. Run time is like 3 hours of BLAH!"
3,Jane Seymour Given Short Shrift,"I had waited over 20 years to finally obtain a copy of this 2 part TV movie I saw as a child--the main reason I wanted it, is because I am a Jane Seymour devotee and I could recall that she did a wonderful job in her role as a ""Frankenstein creature"" in this movie. Seeing on the video carton that it was put on tape in 1995, at the height of her ""DR. Quinn"" popularity, I felt safe in assuming her scenes in this movie would be untouched and intact, despite the fact that an hour had been cut from this film when released on video...Boy was I wrong and what a terrible disappointment it was. There must have been a half dozen scenes focusing on her character, the resurrected Prima, that had been given the axe......ruined this great scary movie by pushing Jane's role to the side or should I say by leaving it in Prima's reanimation tank..."
5,Finally!,"Finally, the ultimate screen version of the Mary Shelly classic is available on DVD! This British production boasts an impressive cast (John Gielgud, Ralph Richarson, James Mason, Agnes Moorehead), superior production values, and a beautifully realized script by the great playwright Christopher Isherwood (""Berlin Stories""). I saw this when it originally aired on television in the 1970's, and it made an indelible impression on me. I've been waiting for years to see it again, and this release has not disappointed. If you're looking for a DVD of outstanding quality, rife with extras, this is not the DVD of choice. If, however, you are looking for the definitive version of Shelly's tale of hubris gone awry, beautifully filmed with outstanding performances, you likely won't do any better than the mesmerizing ""Frankenstein: The True Story""."
4,I hope it holds up...,"I first saw this movie in the early 70's on network TV. It was split into 2 nights, 2 hours each night, and it truly terrified me. I was far too young to grasp any of the ideas of the movie but the scenes from early in the first half of the movie involving the dismembered arm have stuck with me for 30 years. I absolutely will be getting this when it is released on DVD at the end of September."
4,We Need A DVD Of This Movie!,Probably the very best of the MANY Frankenstein films I've ever seen...and I've a LOT of them.A more realistic take on the old story makes it all the more tragic as we watch the creature shunned and deteriorate before us. That kind of psychological and physical scarring combine to make a creature whose anger we all can relate to. You really feel for him.Masterful work by all.Please! A DVD soon!
4,i feel good,"classic men he was . he set the standards for so many artists fron all types of music , soul , rock, country ,even elvis"
3,Wasn't as good as I had hoped...,"I had heard great reviews of this film and it is really hard to find in any streaming or consumption service. So, I had to buy it. It was slower than I thought and although it explains a lot of the inner workings between the delegates of the countries, it doesn't really get to a strong point of why these land masses got split up or the repercussions into the future. Maybe I was asking too much of it. It is a good movie, just not great."
4,Interesting Work,"It is a modern fairytale of the Treaty of Versailles -a sound failure of then western diplomacy as the history has testifies.This work is interesting for historical data and mere technically, for mixing performing with doco."
3,Licorice for Indigestion,I ordered these licorice chewables to help with digestion and INdigestion! They don't taste very good but hopefully will help. It took a long time for this supplier to ship my order which was discouraging.
1,New formula or bad batch?,"This was my favorite DGL for years. Amazon didn't have it for a while. When I saw it was back in stock, I ordered 2 bottles. Big mistake.Either I got a bad batch, or NL has changed the formula. The tablets have a different taste and texture than before. They burned my throat rather than soothed. I opened both bottles and both were the same ""new"" flavor and texture.I've tried most of the other brands and the NL is the only one that worked. Now I'm stuck with 2 bottles I can't use."
5,miracle pills,I have had a 2 yr case of intractable gastritis and reflux. I have been on every prescription drug you can think of. I am a Dr so I have even gone as far as getting meds from Canada and Mexico not available in the states. Nothing really worked. It had become so bad I could hardly eat. I lost 20lbs and was almost unable to work and really totally disabled. The pain was even hard to describe. I have been using these daily along with smaller amounts of the whole licorice root for almost 3 months and making a slow recovery. I can eat normal food again and have some quality of life back. I am confident with more time and these pills I will eventually recover. These have saved my life.
5,Works VERY well,"At the advice of my pharmacist, I purchased these as an alternative to main stream over the counter medicines (Rolaids, Gaviscon) for heartburn, indigestion, etc. I was pleasantly surprised to find not only something that worked EXTREMELY well, but also required only one dosage instead of multiple ones as the above-mentioned products often do. The taste isn't ""yummy"" but it's not that bad either. I don't like black licorice, and I don't mind eating these. Also, I have noticed that unlike the above medicines, this stuff doesn't affect my bowels either. And if that weren't enough, I have also found myself taking less on a reoccurring basis compared to the others."
2,tastes good,I love licorice. have used for couple of months no noticable change in digestion or size. Will switch to other soft licorice to get a licorice fix.
1,"Great dictionary, but what I wanted","Harrap's is an excellent dictionary, and I wanted a Spanish dictionary for my Kindle because I read a considerable amount of Spanish (particularly scholarly books) and thought it would be great to have a dictionary at hand. If all of my Spanish books were Kindle books, it would be great. It works beautifully within Kindle and I like the Kindle search function.But there appears to be no way to get it to function as a stand-alone dictionary so that I can search for words while I am reading an old-fashioned book in Spanish. Since most of the Spanish I read is not available for Kindle, the dictionary is not useful. Please add a regular stand-alone search function!"
4,"Nice Compilation, but missing stuff","Every album that Melissa released, was better than this, thats why I gave it a 4. This album does have some of her greatest stuff, however it could have used more."
5,Best version of Requiem I've found yet,"Very different from most recordings of Mozart's Requiem. It is my favorite that I've found yet. There mix is very dry, so it sounds very clear and present -- almost like it is recorded in your local church, rather than in a cathedral. Choir is fantastic, very clear and bell like. Highly recommended for those interested in a good recording of Mozart's beautiful and haunting spiritual masterpiece."
3,It won't knock you over!,"A daringly austere office building towers above the teeming streets of Manhattan. Shortly after it opens, a woman dies from a glass pane hurtling down from the upper stories, and an office executive is killed when his floor's windows blow out, leaving him hanging from a precarious ledge until his heart fails. An engineer is hired to discern the building's flaws, as lawsuits mount against the nefarious owner. Suddenly, the engineer comes to a ghastly conclusion.....! A well written, taut drama which blends non-fiction events with an array of colorful fictional characters, and tension-filled plot elements. A real page-turner!"
2,Not very durable,"I think these Breyer toys are meant to sit on a shelf as a collector's item, not to be enjoyed by young children. The saddle does not come off or go back on easily and both the girth and stirrups broke very quickly. The horse itself is fragile. Like our other Breyer horses, the legs and tail on this one have broken off. The doll itself does't fit well on the saddle and also breaks easily. My 7 year old daughter isn't rough on her toys, but she bought this set with her own money because she loves horses and wanted to actually play with it. I would not recommend this toy as anything other than a collector's item."
5,LOVE THEM!!!!!,"I happened to grab these at the local grocery store and i just love them. They give more coverage then most pantyliners and yet they are soft like cotton underwear. I cant stand the feel of most liners. I wasn't able to find these anywhere else after buying that first pack, so i came here and loved the fact that i could buy them in bulk. I'll be ordering another case soon."
5,LOVE THIS PRODUCT! NEVER STOP SELLING!!!!,"I used to be able to purchase these packs in my local drug store or supermarket. For some reason I have a hard time finding this SPECIFIC product. I have tried EVERY panty-liner on the market and this is BY FAR THE BEST ONE!!!PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE....NEVER stop selling this item! Buying a huge quantity like this is actually GREAT! I will be ordering another case soon!!!"
1,uncomfortable,"I'm glad the other reviewers like this product because each purse-pak is nicely packaged and convenient to carry, plus it's a great value. For me, I found out these liners were too thick and rough against my skin vs. the thinner, softer regular liners you find in stores. Unfortunately, I got a case load of these and unable to wear them comfortably. I hope potential buyers wouldn't have such issues, then it'd be a useful purchase."
2,Heidegger rots zen minds too!,"This book is definitely something of a disappointment. Dogen can be a difficult author, but this is not the book we need to clarify Dogen's thought. Abe's primary influence seems to be Heidegger, and he has contracted some of that philosopher's worst tendencies. He announces conclusions, but instead of motivating them with reasons, he tends to just repeat the same thing in three or four different ways. He also seems to think that abstruse terminology serves as insight and explanation. Another noticeable defect in this book is Abe's apparent lack of knowledge concerning Dogen's Tendai background. He accepts without reservation the hagiographical legend of Dogen's doubt concerning the need for practice in the context of Tendai original enlightenment doctrine, as if no one had ever thought of this before and no answers had been proposed. He also frequently presents views Dogen inherited from medieval Tendai as original and new insights. Overall, a disappointing effort."
3,Please let's get deeper about contemporary!,"The author has chosen some of the most known and interesting american architects of our time, but he didn't dare to present some younger artists, who better represent our contemporary time. Also the projects are not presented with the necessary profundity and drawings. Nevertheless a book to have."
3,"good, but not terrific","I think this is a pretty good figure, but it has some pros and cons.Pros: good detales, comes with stand, comes with cam droid, talking standCons: bad articulation, cam droid comes off stand a lot, to speak have to have a commtech reader, and so on.This was a good addition to my collection and I would recomend it."
3,Haven't I read that before?,"While Smith's book is a very good introduction to Zen for Americans who have no background in Buddhism, I have one complaint. In at least two sections, Smith quotes verbatim from her collection Zen 365, without acknowledging the original sources. In Beginners Introduction to Zen, it appears as Smith's own words. In Zen 365, these passages are attributed to someone else. Very disconcerting. Otherwise, it is a competent introduction and I enjoyed reading it."
5,Great Book for Beginners... and great refresher.,"As the title suggests, a perfect guide for beginners.Id venture to say Id suggest this be a perfect ""first"" for those curious and interested in Zen and Buddhism as a whole.The author has clear and simple explanations from practice to visiting centers. A to Z and nicely organized.Those more experienced could also use this as a refresher as well.I highly recommend this book for everyone."
1,Lightweight,"As a life-long practitioner of Buddhism, I found this book incredibly lightweight and superficial. Even though it is intended for beginners, I am amazed by its lack of depth. Apparently, the author does not feel beginners can handle the reality of Buddhism and must dilute its great truths to garner interest. I was disappointed by this book."
