2,ALMOST AS WORSE AS MK 3'S SUPER NINTENDO VERSION!,"THIS IS JUST A DUMB GAME LIKE MK 3 WAS. ALMOST ALL VERSIONS OF THIS GAME WAS STUPID EXCEPT FOR THE SEGA SATURN VERSION. BUT, NONE OF THE HOME VERSIONS WERE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ARACDE VERSION. THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME. THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY INFERIOR LIKE THOSE OF THE REGULAR MORTAL KOMBAT 3 FOR THIS SYSTEM AND THE CONTROLS ARE BAD. IF YOU EVER WILL FIND IT AND YOU STILL HAVE ITS SYSTEM, GET THE SEGA SATURN VERSION ONLY!!!!! UNFORTUNATELY, THERE NEVER WAS A PLAYSTATION VERSION FOR THIS GAME. THE LAST MK GAME THAT WAS RELEASED FOR SUPER NINTENDO BEFORE THE SYSTEM WAS DISCONTINUED FOR THE NINTENDO 64."
3,"Windsor, not Detroit","I have a lot of trouble with this album. While it's true that there is supposed to be a certain degree of...ah...monotony going on here with this style of techno, there's others who do acid so much better and with a much more interesting palette of sounds than Richie Hawtin does here. The album seems to be overly reliant on washing everything overall with arena-sized reverb, and there's far too much use of a certain...well, it's not a sample if it goes on as long as it does here...from an old ""Outer Limits"" episode that Eon did so much better with on his ""The Void Dweller"" album. The one adjective that keeps coming to mind here is 'self-indulgent', really. And an aside for those who think this is 'Detroit music'...sorry, kiddies, but this comes from the wrong side of the river, both geographically and musically."
5,"this is a good, good album","every song on this album is well constructed, and flows into the next brilliantly. ritchie hawtin is a genius - check out his other projects under his name and the name FUSE. plus, the album artwork is fun. i love this album."
5,perpetually essential electronica,"I've had it for almost 10 years and I will keep it forever. One of those that you really should have. It's like an old school textbook that taught you everything you know, deserves respect, and the occasional listen on into perpetuity..."
3,Plastikman's techno beat-fest. Sheet One,"I'm actually intrigued by this CD, spellbinding beats meets ambient soundscapes. Power meets ambience. I decided to check-out 'Sheet One' based on a Mojo Magazine reference to 'brilliant psychadelic music', and psychadelic and mezmerizing this is, in a techno sense that is. Plastikman's arrangements are actually minimal, just think a more danceable 'Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2', speaker-shredding throbbing beats meets techno/post-rock type soundscapes. Ambient music that you can dance to, but cerebral enough to expose a high degree of musical aptitude. Really interesting stuff."
4,"Great movie NO English subs, My hindi is still poor!",I was seriously disappointed when this movie arrived with no subs. I remember watching this movie with subs on netflix. My hindi is still not that great so there were parts difficult to understand. Loved the movie as before so now gonna search for the English sub one.
4,Fun & Entertaining,"Initially after the DVD began I thought that my little one might not like it because of how old the videos are! Kids now days are so use to such high definition movies and cartoons that I wasn't quite sure that this would get her attention... HOWEVER I was WRONG she really enjoyed watching and singing along. She has asked to watch it several times now yelling about the cow jumping over the moon! So I would have to say don't judge it on how old it is but by how your kiddo will interact with it. We are giving it two thumbs up for entertaining and fun!!Disclosure: This review was made possible by Mom Spark Media. All opinions, photos, and experiences are Keeping Up With The Rheinlander's own."
1,mediocre piano solo,this is NOT a vocal selection. I was misled by the reviewer. This arrangement has awkward chords with nothing special in sound. since i bought it for a choral group i ordered several and it was a complete WASTE.
5,wish it was more easily available,"THis is an excellent musical collection to own. If only it was easily found at a decent price. Direct seems to be the only option, and even that seems to be a little complicated. So someone, make this cd more easily available and we'll buy it!!!Great cd![...]"
3,Good late effort,"Pretty darn good for being so late in Lightnin' Hopkins' career (recorded in 1969). Still, those who want only his best should look elsewhere. 'California Mudslide' is nice and there's good stuff all over, with some reservations. 'Jesus Would You Come By Here', one of two tracks on which he plays a sort of roller rink organ, is frustrating because he doesn't complete the verses. Look for an earlier, much better version called 'Needed Time' on the CD 'Jake Head Boogie.' Two other tracks show him playing piano; good if you want variety, but he's better on guitar. Some other tracks ('Rosie Mae', Antoinette's Blues', 'New Santa Fe', 'No Education') are remakes of his earlier tunes."
5,The best!,"This book is truely amazing.Having read a few of Coelho's book I've come to know his style of writing and this book was a punch in the face in the way it handled the delicate issue of the mentally-ill in such a straight-forward un-orthodox way.This is the story of Vernika, who tries to commit suicide, fails, and is sent to a rough, secluded and horrible insane asylum, where she learns about life, the importance and the beauty of it...Just read it..."
2,Poor design,"Difficult for different sizes of toothbrushes, pretty but poor design, needs to be more adaptable. Does not fit kids size toothbrushes that have a wide shaft."
4,Nice!,It complements our bathroom decore. The cup is plastic not Glass. But it is perfect if you throw your toothpaste tube in it :)
5,Thank you Mrs. Knight,"At Home With Gladys Knight is a wonderful, inspiring book. I bought this book for my parents who both have diabetes. After years of trying to get them to follow doctor recommended diets it is a relief to have a book that inspires my parents to not only care about their diet, but their physical fitness as well.Mrs. Knight has created a quick and easy read that is full of motivation. This book gets 5 stars in the Murphy household."
2,"A Disappointing Follow-On to ""Rewrites""","I was anxious to see the arrival of ""The Play Goes On"" as I had really enjoyed ""Rewrites"", but felt as though Simon had more to say, but hadn't been able to get to it in the first of this biographical series. However, this latest lacked the humor of ""Rewrites"" and I felt myself without much incentive to keep turning pages other than to get some insights to some of his lesser-known works."
4,An excellent show,"8 Simple Rules is an excellent show, unfortunately this is the season where John Ritter passes away. There are essentially three different shows here, the one with John Ritter - that we all came to love, the one where the family (and us, really) deal with John Ritter/Paul's death, and the show after they move on - with James Garner & David Sapde. The show was different later on, but still a good show. James Garner was a brilliant addition of both comedy and heart, and nobody could have been a funnier addition than David Spade.The DVD is OK. All episodes are uncut, but the introductions to John Ritter's final episodes are missing. There are no special features, which is disappointing."
3,A mixed bag.,"8 Simple Rules could've been a strong season if not for the untimely death of John Ritter in 2003. Ritter was the heart and backbone of this show and without him - this sitcom was never the same. Ritter is only in the first 3 episodes and it is sad to go back and watch, he was such a dynamic force. James Garner and David Spade were brought in to revamp the show, I like Garner - but dislike Spade (he's just not funny!). Ok season but the magic had diminished."
3,8 Simple Rules Rvw,"Product was delivered in condition it was promised and within deadline. The shipping, however, took a lot longer than anticipated. This could very well have been due to the post office itself."
4,Best of the light and the heavy,"Inventive death metal put to epic melodies, the harmony and keyboards add to a majestic feel. One of the most original death metal albums to come out in awhile."
2,Not up to the hype,"I can't for the life of me see why this band, and CD gets so many rave reviews. I mean...the music is interesting, I'll give it that, and it's death metal, but it's not aggressive at all. It's more like...how opeth would sound if they went death. Very drawn out, technical, and after a while...boring. The lyrics are pretty hilarious...but good - like a well written Cannabil Corpse. I'm giving it 2 stars because it just bores me pretty much...but I will throw it in the CD player every now and then just to listen to something different."
1,The Cells?,"You probably know this band or never heard of them. Well we all know this band because it comes with Windows Media Player when you first download it or when you first buy a PC. We sometimes don't pay those bands any mind because well we think they suck. Well that's not tru in some cases but in this case it's true. They are very lyrically retarded and when it comes to music, it's not for the masses but it's not that good either for the small groups who listen to bands that no one has ever heard of but I have to admit they do have memorable songs. This album is not that great though, so kinda avoid this."
3,Biblia,Buen precio pero la calidad de la impresion es de baja calida y el cover/ covertura es de mala calidad.
4,Family traditions unite generations,"Here we have another story with a Grandpa and a child, this time a boy, as the main characters. This Grandpa and grandson take time to notice various wildlife around them while tapping the Maple trees; red squirrels, grosbeaks, and nuthatches, to name a few. Another difference is that the evaporator (giant pot to boil in) is located outside. Though the story is slightly different, the end result is the same - syrup is made and enjoyed together by the two generations.I enjoyed this book also. I liked the inclusion of the wildlife as they gathered the sap. It helped you have a sense of being outdoors with the characters. I also enjoyed how the boy works with his grandpa to make the syrup together. I can easily see the illustrations being drawn from real family photos; though I don't believe they are."
4,arragance unleased,This series would be much better if the writers would not have taken thier personal scewed political agenda as the normal and excepted by everyone.
1,Language-French?,I have been waiting for this also and was ready to pre-order until I noticed the langauage was French! This sent a red flag is there a mistake in the discription?
1,A waste of money...,"I bought this book when I first began teaching private art lessons. I was very disappointed in it. The projects are okay but not serious or interesting enough for private lessons. The drawings in it are not very appealing. I have not used it much at all. However, someone who wants crafty projects for activities might find it useful."
3,Probably will work fine for a slim PDA,"I have an iPaq with an expansion pack. The expansion pack makes the whole unit twice as thick, and this PDA holder just doesn't work with it. If you don't have this problem, then it should be fine for you."
4,It's OK,I'm sure it is difficult to make a universal PDA holder- but they have done a good job. My PDA is an Ipaq and it works OK in the holder.
3,Uneven Holiday Humor,"This is an uneven collection of Holiday novelty songs. By their nature, novelty songs are intended to be humorous or funny. Some of the songs on this collection are and some are not.This collection consists of more comedy routines than musical numbers. The arrangement of songs was weird to me in that it started weak, with the Twelve Pains of Christmas, and ended weak, with a couple of Hanukkah songs followed by New Year's songs. There were some highlights such as It's So Chic, Santa's Lament, the Pretty Little Dolly, and my favorite, Christmas is Coming Twice This Year. Overall, it provides a break from traditional Christmas songs and provides some funny moments, but could have been stronger."
3,Christmas tradition,Every year we buy a few Christmas Comedy songs to even out the traditional ones...this is an okay collection of classic comedy christmas songs.
2,"Lame, Lame, Lame","There's a couple of good songs on this CD, but other than that it's a very weak Christmas collection for Dr. Demento. Skip it and get the other Dr. Demento Christmas CD ""The Greatest Christmas Novelty CD of All Time."" Except for the tired, dumb, and overplayed ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"" and ""The Chipmunk Song,"" THAT was a good Christmas CD. ""Holidays In Dementia,"" is not Dr. Demento's best compilation."
5,Excellent Collection of Offbeat christmas songs,The is a very funny collection of some of the best humorous Christmas songs around. If your tired of all the tradional Christmas songs and you want to laugh and have a good time then you should buy this cd!
5,Great chemistry by Marilyn Horowitz,Screen Couple Chemistry was a fascinating read that provided me with new insights into the underlying structure of romantic relationships in the Hollywood pantheon. This was particularly helpful in my work as a writer and teacher of screenwriting at NYU. I recommend this book to anyone interested in movies or about to write a screenplay with a romance in it. Nochimson's view of Hollywood hypocrisy is an eye opener and a doorway for any writer who wants to find something new and original to write.
2,2 for effort,"I bought this book in hopes to find something for my nephew to read and understand about certain secrets. In hopes to get something more wide range then what was in the book. It doesnt explain very well about secrets and the whole purpose of ""good touch and bad touch"" it says ""you know the differnece"" and doesnt really explain that even parents may want you to keep bad secrets. Except for the small note that its confusing if a parent wants you to keep something from the other parent. Not to mention that this book is made of very cheap paper...read the print paperback because that is sure what you get.I wouldnt recommened this book to anybody.It more or less will turn kids into sneaky joke playing brats because ""some secrets are fun"" according to the book. So go ahead and sneak up on people, and suprise them...because its ""okay""yeah right!"
3,Overpriced,"I bought this book through amazon for $7.00+. When I received the book, the US price on the back was around $3.95. Plus, I paid shipping on top of the $7. I was not happy to see I was ripped off."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book to read to any child or group of children to discuss the topic of secrets. I used it with children who have witnessed domestic violence and it was a great tool to discuss ""secrets"" that the children should tell and what kind of secrets are good to keep."
3,"Not bad, could be better","The idea is great, but not great illustrations and the message could be better."
4,Deep but worth the read,"Typically John Piper's books are a bit too deep for me and I have difficulty understanding them. In his book, ""The Pleasures of God"", he does a very eloquent job of explaining God's delight in being God.The book has taken me a while to get through but wisdom that is gained through reading it is priceless."
4,Enthralled with God's Excellency!,"This is one of the three most important books that Dr. Piper has given us. Voted one of the top 100 books of the 20th century by World magazine, this book focuses on the character of God by gazing through the lense of His pleasures and delights. It is a thorough-going Calvinistic look at the greatness and beauty of God with a passionate emphasis on prayer and missions. Of great value is the chapter on obedience which shows how faith and obedience are organically connected. Obedience is not just an optional second stage of discipleship. It is essential to genuine faith. I whole-heartedly recommend this book. If you want to delight yourself in the Lord (Ps. 37:4), you could hardly choose a better starting point."
5,A book to surely transform your view of God!,"Of all the books that I've read on the character and attributes of God, none have been so profound and refreshing as this. The focus, as the title suggests, is on the things that delight and glorify God. They include: His Son, all He does, His creation, election, doing good to all who hope in Him, and more. This book helped to transform my two-dimensional view of God and inject much needed vitality into my relationship with Him. It will do the same to you, and may even challenge your conception of Him"
5,Pleasure reading...,"Piper shows us the things in which God delights; in so doing, we are called to delight in these things, to love God for who he is and be grateful for the unbelievable delight he has for us."
2,There is no life without the Holy Spirit,"I just completed a group study on this book. We spent months on it, not setting any time limit so we could go through all the questions and down all the rabbit-trails we needed to.I had a very hard time reading this book. It was not the subject matter, but rather the dryness and lifelessness of the book. I had to force myself to trudge through each paragraph, and became increasingly bothered and irritated, not really knowing why, and very puzzled by my reaction, which I describe as almost an aversion. Finally, at the final session, I was struck with the reason: THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THIS BOOK.The Holy Spirit is the life of God in us. It is how God convicts and guides us. It is, in basic terms, God in us. Without a treatment of the work of the Holy Spirit, the book is not only incomplete, but uninspired and dead."
2,A crummy version of a great game,"The Sega Genesis version of this game is no where near as good as the arcade. In fact, I would say that it doesn't even come close. There are stages missing, Sheeva has been removed from the game, & voices have also been removed. The Animalities that are in the arcade version have also been removed. The music also sounds nothing like the arcade game. Scorpion's fatality has been changed. So has Stryker's Friendship. The only good thing about this game is that the hidden characters are instantly unlocked. If you are expecting alot from getting this title on the Genesis, you will be severely disappointed. If you have to have it as part of a collection, make sure that it's cheaply priced."
3,Better than the stink of MK3,Better than MK3 but still nowhere near as good or exciting as MK 1 & MK2.
5,Great music.,"This release is full of awesome guitar riffs, great piano/keyboard work, and inspiring music altogether. I recommend it to any rock fan. Not to mention the great quality of production. Can't wait for a second release."
5,u-turn rocks,"This band needs air time on the radio. Buy it you wont be disappointed. All songs were wrote by the band, not by someone else. it's hard to find true talent these days. visit their website www.u-turnrocks.com."
2,some useful information...if you're a woman,"This book should be titled: 976 Ways for Women to Stay Healthy. There is some good information, but you will get a lot more out of it if you are female. Looking for information on menstrual problems, tender breasts, or vaginal issues?...there's a section for each. But ANYTHING related to the prostate, forget it. Even the sections that affect both sexes are written in a very biased and annoying way...as if the only readers are women. Perhaps I'm a little more bothered by the writing style because I'm a guy, but that's why I'm writing this review, to serve as a warning to other men seeking natural cures to keep looking."
4,Dee Dee drank our Xmas money,"This is a pretty good collection of punk Christmas songs. It opens with a fun novelty song that is not by a real punk band. Then we move on to the real punks. The quality of the material varies, but some of the best cuts are contributed by the Dickies, Sloppy Seconds, the Greedies and (naturally) the Ramones. But my personal favorite here is ""Homo Christmas"" by Pansy Division, which is hilarious. I have to mention the contributions by a couple of guys who are not usually associated with the punk genre. El Vez, the ""Mexican Elvis"", performs a surprisingly credible thrash punk version of ""Feliz Navidad"". And Mojo Nixon performs an unsurprisingly sloppy rewrite of ""Louie Louie"" called ""Christmas Christmas"". It's not really punk, and it's not really good. It sounds like an outtake from Mojo's lousyChristmas album, although it's not. If you are a fan of punk, especially ""old school"" punk, you should enjoy this."
4,Mosh Pittin Fun,"This review is written more for the parent looking for something to buy their punk musically inclined offspring for Christmas. Nutshelling it - if someone likes punk music, they will like this CD. So if you are looking for a Christmas gift for the hard to buy for - this should fill their stockings with glee.It is a great XMAS album for punk rock fans and any one else with a sense of humor; you do need a sense of humor for some songs especially Homo Christmas which isn't exactly Bing Crosby (although do people still mosh pit? I am pretty uncool). Anyway, this is just what it says - A Punk Rock XMAS album. There are a lot of rockin songs from right off the start, with It's Gonna Be A Punk Rock Christmas by the Ravers to the final version of White Christmas."
1,Disappointed!!,Balance That Works When Life Doesn't: Simple Steps to a Woman's Physical and Spiritual HealthThe Writer expects perfection from the reader. This book is very dissappointing. It is not what I expected at all! I didn't get past chapter 4!
3,"Unit Pride - ""Can't Kill a Dream""","If you're really into NYHC from the mid-80's through 1988 then you will really love this CD as this west coast band mimics the NYHC sound from that era with a precision that's scary. This record came out in the 80's so it's no retro hackjob, it's more of a tribute to the sound that the band was really stoked on. What's nice about this though is that even though it's almost 25 years old it sounds fresher than modern bands that are trying to mimic NYHC from that era."
2,Different from original Boggle,"I love playing Boggle, both the original game and the computer game, so I was disappointed with this book. The rules are somewhat different, making it too easy. Also, there is no ""correct"" word list, so you can assume all the words you make are correct. Just not what I had expected."
3,Not the same,"Ehhh, it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. It does pass the time, but is basically kinda boring and not a bit as fun as the actual game."
1,No more,I have been a customer @ Amazon.com for many years.I can't review this because I NEVER received the package.Now shopping at Barnes & Nobles for my needs.
3,"it is not what I expected,","I guess I was looking for something that related to current dietary issues and the book is based on medical findings of Dewey back in the late 19th and early 20th Century. Its readabile, and interesting to note we are still practicing starvation as a means of fixing ourselves, something that was prescribed over 100 years ago."
3,1886,"Call this dated book a glimpse into fasting history. It was then known under the fad name of ""hygiene"" and is still practiced as such today by Seventh Day Adventists. Interesting but not groundbreaking."
2,Not particularly useful,"Like other reviewers, I agree that it's not a user friendly book. I've read medical jargon in briefs, and they at least have summaries so that you can get the essence, but I haven't finished this book yet because it just doesn't get to the point fast enough and there are plenty of books out there right now validating the 2 meals a day or partial fasting route to health. I was hoping for more anecdotal material but haven't found it yet."
3,"Problematic yet strangely attractive, nostalgic","The storyline to Final Fantasy Legend II (Second installment of the SaGa series in Japan, billed as Final Fantasy in the U.S. to boost sales) is interesting, but the characters in the game are impersonal and the game's bland, linear nature will leave modern games yearning for the depth, control, and immersion that today's RPGs give. Also, the game is incredibly easy until the very end, when it becomes frustratingly difficult. You'll have the ability to customize your part in the beginning, my suggestion is 2 mutants and 2 humans, but after that your wiggle room for customization is very small.Do I recommend this game? For regular (non-advance) Game Boy owners, it is a must have - the FFL series is the pinnacle of old-time portable RPG titles. However, there are much better games out there today; it might be worth saving your money. If you have this game lying around and haven't played it though, it might provide quite a few hours of enjoyment."
4,Straight across the line,"This game was not a Final Fantasy but much like today a bunch of wanna be Final Fantasies are released why to sell a game that might not have sold otherwise. It doesn't really matter if this is Saga or Secret of Mana (Final Fantasy Adventure), the fact is that it's still a square title. Plus if you were looking for an RPG when this game was out Final Fantasy and Zelda were all you had for gameboy. This game kept my interest it wasn't until gameboy color tho that portable rpgs existed in the mainstream so given time and place a good game."
5,Zildjian Makes the Finest Cymbals,"You cannot beat Zildjian. They make the greatest cymbals in the world! I currently own the 20"" Ping Ride. Let me tell you, this cymbal is remarkable! Get it... you will not be disappointed!"
4,One of Hillermans best,"Great series. Plots are ok but not more and the characters perhaps a bit underdeveloped. However, the atmosphere from the Navajo land is great and what sets this apart is the beautiful, sparse language of the dialogues. And, the simplicity of the plots makes the stories more believable, which is usually way preferable. All in all, this is great stuff. And the way they are read? I sometimes cringe hearing how the reader portraits the female voices (makes them feel a little more silly than I think they were meant) - apart from that - great. Puts the weight and pauses in the right spots. This is one series where I prefer the audiobooks to reading the books themselves."
5,Hillerman does it again!,"Navajo Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is challenged once again in this unique mystery, another masterpiece from Tony Hillerman."
3,Listening Woman,Good story but not one of my favorite Leaphorn/Chee books. Seems like it took less time to read this one.
4,Leaphorn thinks he's Dirk Pitt,"The first half of Listening Woman, the third in the Joe Leaphorn series, is vintage Hillerman. There's lots of desert scenery and insights into Native American life. Unlike other books, this book is focused entirely within the Navajoes but even then we learn that there are 58 clans, 57 who keep Navajo time and then this clan that's slow even by Navajo standards. Of course, much of the mystery takes place on their turf.Joe is investigating a variety of backburner cases as an excuse to be in an area where a motorist had nearly hit him. As he digs deeper, a missing helicopter and an FBI investigation seem to be involved in whatever is going on. Enter the Dirk Pitt side of Joe's personality. I won't spoil the surprise but suffice it to say that Joe endures flame, flood and a host of other harrowing experiences as he solves the crime and saves the day.Bottom line: Less religion and culture, more action than the other Hillerman's I've read. Still, a fun, entertaining read."
5,Early Leapthorn excels at Lore,"This early Leapthorn novel must have passed me by before now. Later novels, both with Leapthorn and Chee, tend to emphasize the problems of dual cultures, but Leapthorn here is Navajo first, cop second. Since the case is about the alleged desecration of a ritual site, Joe interviews a traditional medicine woman attending ceremonial gathering. I enjoyed a glimpse of these rites as much as the solution to a cracking mystery involving Native American activists, straying Catholic priests and kidnapped Boy Scouts."
4,Historical inaccuracy,"The Leaphorn books are generally informative as to Navajo culture, and I like reading about the ceremonies, etc. There is a glaring historical error early in this book, however, that took me right out of the story. Hillerman relates how Narbona, the legendary Navajo warrior and leader, resisted being relocated to Bosque Redondo, and fought with Kit Carson. Further, he states that Narbona and his group spent the winter of 1863 hiding out on Navajo lands, then turned themselves in in 1864. None of this is correct. Narbona was killed in 1849 by troops under the command of Colonel John Washington, while attending a peace talk. To my knowledge, Carson never crossed paths with Narbona. The Navajo warrior who resisted relocation to Bosque Redondo was Manuelito, but he turned himself in in 1866, not 1864."
4,"educational ,sensitive and magical","My husband and I purchased this book because we are always searching for good books to read to our nine grandchildren..they have loved the Byrd Baylor books. ""Hawk, I am Your Brother"" is education and sensitive to being quiet and watching to learn. It is an easy read for all ages of our grandchildren, ages 18 years old to 9 years old. No matter the age they loved being read to, especially by Grandpa. They already watch TV that does nothing for their imagination or originality. We have found the local bookstores thin on Baylor books. :("
5,A way of seeing through a childs eyes,A great story of how children believe in something that is so real and play it out. And yet are understood by adults. I wished my parents could see the 'reality of me' when I was in those places. I find it a great way of getting children to know they can dream.
2,"A lot of ground covered, but boring and undecisive","The best thing about the book is the title. The author discusses in length some obvious limitations on forecasting which exist simply because we are finite beings. But Rescher's formulation of this quite trivial fact sounds as follows: ""the predictive venture of securing rationally warranted foresight into the future therefore faces rather equivocal prospects."" (p.245) Now, this quote is representative of Mr. Rescher's heavy academic style.I completely agree with the Finnish reviewer regarding the lack of depth in any subject and example discussed. Rescher's books on Idealism are much better -- my guess is because he is an Idealist and enjoys writing on the subject. Reading this book however I felt that the author just had to finish writing it as a business duty to his publisher."
4,Not bad.....,"I am a VMI alumnus who was a cadet at the time of assimilation (accomodation, as I call it), and someone who was, and still is, against women being at VMI, and I would have to say the Dr. Brodie's book is not bad. She covered almost all the bases and did a very good job of laying everything out on the table and telling it like it is. The book does, however, have somewhat of a sympathetic connotation towards females, and neglects to mention the many instances where double standards were used in punishments (or lack thereof) dished out by the Commandant's Office, among the many other double standards that did and do take place. Overall, though, I would say that the book paints a good picture of what it was like with minimal bias."
3,A for effort,"I give this book three stars for effort but it did not do what I wanted it to do. I was looking for a bit more detail as to life at the ""I"" and unfortunetly Mrs. Fairchild spent too much time concentrating on the squables between Alumni and faculty. I wanted to know what it was like to be a woman attending this institution for the first time. I also wanted to know what it was like to be a cadet at VMI.The book is not good as Catherine Minegold's ""In Glory's Shadow"". Or more to the point Disher's ""First Class"" a fictional account of the first female class to attend Annapolis -this book covers all four years.Like someone said this book is really not finished and I am waiting with baited breath for a ""brother rat"" to re-count her four years at VMI."
1,Simply trying to make a buck,"I am a recent graduate of VMI(class of 2000) and I experienced the events covered by the book first hand. I had the fortunate opportunity of being able to experience the corps when it was all-male and then see the transition, so I have a little credibility on the subject. I find Mrs. Brodie's book to be a good example of an outsider's view of a complex, obtuse and guarded military society. She writes of accounts where she portrays the corps of cadets as a whole as knuckle dragging misogynists in a very derogatory way, while making the females out to be some sort of crusader. My main point is this, the wife of the Band Leader (who by the way did not attend VMI either) wrote a book about her outsider's view of what she sees as a black and white story simply to monopolize on the destruction of one of the country's most coveted traditions, the southern all male military school."
1,Unrealistic Point of View,"This is a nice book though it overlooks the basic differences between men and women. As a graduate of the Air Force Academy I know from personal experience that men and women are not the same. Of course, they are equal in the eyes of God, but they aren't the same. This book glosses over the fact that women can't keep up to the standards of men. In my experience I found that women are always a little weaker and slower than the male cadets. So there is always a double standard. Women can be a great asset to the military and society. However, there are somethings that women can not do as well as men. This book pretends that there are no double standards. This is a happyland, feminist fantasy."
2,"A big ""apology"" for a school hopelessly out of touch","While Brodie's book is well written and quite enjoyable to read I do not agree with her conclusions or observations. In essence, this book is a, like a previous reviewer wrote, a PR coup for VMI. Acts of violence and unethical behavior is played down by Brodie as ""cadets just messing around and having a good time"".Although Brodie mentions some of the more conservative alumni and their opinions they are not discussed or observed in a very rational fashion. The comments made by alumni that ""women should not come to VMI"", or ""Women who wants to be part of VMI should marry a VMI man"" are not seen as examples of a view of society that is lagging behind. It is instead seen by Brodie as a charming antic from the South.If one wants a more balanced and academic account of VMI going co-ed one should read ""Women in the Barracks"" instead."
4,Up to the Dummies standard,"Clear and concise writing.Too bad that CF is dying in the marketplace.If you need to get started with CF, this is an excellent choice even though it refers to an older version."
5,It's like running defragmentation software on your mind.,"My stupid college friends made fun of me for listening to things like this back then. I must say, compared to Josh Clayton-Felt and the Beautiful South, Plastikman must have sounded barely like music to them.But I was right all along. There was something genius about Plastikman's minimalism, and that's the reason I am proud to have a dusty copy of THIS in my CD collection and those people have long since disowned their Josh Clayton-Felt CDs (I will never forget, however, that I won.)."
1,Insipid and repetitive,"The first 56 pages are repetitive lists of kitschy phrases like ""no-mo"" and ""fast n'frisky,"" plus endless warnings to stop if your dog isn't interested or doesn't like it (especially fur ruffling!). Well, duh. It's really written for someone who doesn't know their canine ""companion"" very well at all (oh the irony), and it's completely goofy. Linda Tellington-Jones writes much better animal therapy books."
2,Dog massage,"Bought this items several years ago, and never managed to read the entire book. I gave to goodwill last month."
3,Too Theorectical,"This book is too theorectical. Needs to elucidate for readers with examples. Unless you are an UML professor or an abstract UML guru, this book does not help to learn UML. Would help if authors shows UML mapping to say, C++ and Java."
4,Not the standard answer to life's questions.,"If I were trapped on a desert island I would not want this book; I would want a way off of the stinking island. However if one wanted to give a gift that humanistically dealt witha few of the ultimate questions of religion, philosophy, and human existance and was an entertaining easy read, they should give this book.It is, in part, a dective novel set in the very near future containing humor, science fiction, philosophy, and magic. Anyone who enjoys science fiction or fantasy or philosophy or Mike Hammer/Philip Marlowe stories and does not enjoy this novel should be stuck on that stinking desert island."
3,Imperfect Plates,"I ordered several of these plates but had to return several because of defects in the pattern. The pattern was either not centered properly on the plates, or had color defects or scratches. I requested replacement pieces but had to return several of these dues to the same problems. These plates appear to be ""seconds,"" as noted by other reviewers with other patterns. I've ordered other patterns by Corelle from Amazon and noticed the same defects. While I understand that Amazon cannot inspect every item for defects, I do think that Amazon should contact Corelle and determine if Corelle is sending Amazon factory seconds. If Amazon chooses to sell factory seconds, then Amazon should label them as such."
5,I love this book!,"I love the way it's drawned. Very classic but fantastic. I can really feel this illustrator love animals, persons..... also I guess he/she(?) care about colors so much. This book is for adult who loves Art in children's book."
4,I love the illustrations!,"I really really love this book. The illustrations are fantastic, which is why I bought it. My 6 and 3 year old like it when I read it to them, but they don't pull it out on their own."
4,They're a very knowledgable family,"Having discovered ""Dr. Fegg"" several years ago, I find that it has not lost its brashness and humor. I particularly enjoyed a small section similar to Rrich Hall's ""Sniglets"". (Standing ahenny-the position you take when perusing bookshelves) The familiar Python humor infuses the entire miniscule tome. However, anyone who enjoys grins and giggles should enjoy reading this wide-ranging compendium of nonsense."
4,"Memorable, Even After 30 Years","I haven't seen a copy of this book in over 30 years, I'm sure. Still, the theme song for the character ""Depravo, The Rat"" in the Aladdin play still sticks in my mind. Pretty remarkable, considering I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HEARD THE SONG! So powerful are the lyrics to this nonexistent tune, that they actually suggest their own notes in your head, and they stay there for three decades or longer.I won't quote the lyrics for copyright reasons, other than to mention that Depravo hasn't changed his underpants in a very, very long time.There were other things in the book that should be mentioned, but I don't remember any of them, except for the center spread featuring a dragon creature with very sharp talons scratching itself in an inadvisable fashion."
4,You need to Read This one,"Pick this book up and you'll be just about set to venture out and set up your own radio station. If you have an interest in broadcasting, radio, internet radio, or anything near being similar to radio, you need to read this book."
4,Easy learning - declarative approach,"Microsoft Word has been with us for over 10 years. Naturally, with each revision, more features are added. So where do you start learning? Well, this book breaks down the effort into small lessons. A single lesson does not seem that hard. The lessons are also buttressed by a review and quiz (with answers) at the end of each chapter.Hopefully, you should not find anything too difficult here. MS Word fundamentally deals with stuff (text and images) that are WYSIWIG. Relatively few abstractions. The lessons have the virtue that you can perform an operation and usually see its effect immediately in front of you.The most advanced and abstract idea is at the end - writing and running macros. A chance at programming! Any of you programmer types will dig this. Though what you can fully do with macros is only hinted at."
4,clear summaries,"i would recommend this instruction book to anyone like me, a computer novice. summaries at the end of each section, give clear, simple use instructions. index is well done, complete."
1,Where is the CD?,I did not receive a CD with the Word 2003 Personal Trainer Book. One of the main reason I chose this book is it comes with a tutorial CD. If you are thinking you will receive a CD double check.
5,A graphic work of art.,"This book is is one of the best books ive ever read, and i read like 3 books a week, since like 5 years ago.This is awesome, i give it 5 stars heres why, the story makes you want to keep reading its clever, smart, and unique(star #1)The main character (konrad) is a very interesting person hes always changing and learning things,also the other characters such as wolf(the mercenary) elyssa (his friend, and many others are very well drawn.(star #2)The fighting is so very well narrarated its tells you every thing its graphic, gruesome, and very specific, if you like the lord of the rings battles, like those from the movie or book, youll love the ones in this book(star #3)Damn it im getting tired of typing, just get the damn book trust me, you wont regret it, and get 'Shadowbreed' and 'Warhammer' the other 2 books in the trilogy, both being equally as good as konrad,youll love the storys twists and turns, the fighting, the everything, ...."
4,"Short Stories, Many Robots, Few Humans",Grayscale colors and clean lines are used in this collection of futuristic sex tales. In the future humans are endangered and robots are common. Robots have been made in the image of humans to such an extent that they are just as randy as their creators.These tales all deal with the future technology and how it impacts human (and robot) relations. The fact that the cover claims this is volume 1 gives fans hope that there may be more stories soon.
1,Deeply Disappointing,"Let me start by saying that I am an enormous fan of Ray Charles. For this reason, I deeply regret purchasing and watching this disc. Just to be clear the Voices of Jubilation Choir is very good. They are a talented group presenting Christmas classics with energy and emotion. Mr. Charles, however, is the problem. He is often off key and his tone is a shadow of what it once was. It's quite sad frankly. Even the greats can have a disastrously bad night, but it's truly tragic that this performance has been added to the canon of Ray Charles' work."
5,Amazing Vocals,"Beyoncé Knowles will DEFINITELY be a successful soloist! She has such amazing vocals and they are showcased on her first solo single, ""Work It Out."" The song has a 70s feel, the beat (produced by the Neptunes) is fantastic, and Beyoncé really lets it go on the singing, wailing and belting it out. I can't wait for her solo album to be released! She has some serious talent."
5,Working It Out,"I have to say I'm not impressed with the Neptunes production on this song at all. It aounds like something I could make on my cheesy little sampling keyboard from 1985. Please, do Beyonce some justice and play some real instruments behind her!! On the other hand, Beyonce sings the heck out of this one. Can't wait for her solo album, even though I'm a big fan of Destiny's Child as a whole."
5,calm is always good,"I have the original program and since I'm a geek in any case - meditation on the computer works for me and that is basically what this program does - but it fools you into thinking you are just having fun. I recommend it, and to all ages - my 18-year-old stepdaughter loves it."
3,ok product,I purchased this for my daughter (30)as a gift (her request)I did not use it. She did with good results.
5,"Your One A Day ""Vitamin"" for Mindfulness","Josh Baran has condensed the dharma into daily multi-vitamins that will change your life: short, sweet, and extremely powerful. You will love it.Victor Davich author, 8 Minute Meditation: Quiet Your Mind. Change Your Life."
4,365 Nirvana Here and Now:Living Every Moment in Enlightenment,Very inspiriting. Great read daily to give a person focus.
4,Good Reel for the Price,"After inspecting and installing the reel, I can say it is a good reel for the price. It is your typical molded plastic wheel, but what do you expect for $30? There are much higher quality metal, heavy duty reels, but these will run you $100+. For the average user with light use, such as washing your car on the weekends, this will work just great. I used a 75 ft hose and the reel seems pretty full, I would not suggest a 100 ft hose on this. It reels in and out pretty easily - when reeling the hose up you generally have to guide the hose a little bit with your hand so it wraps up evenly.I have seen reviews where people say the fittings leak over time, but due to my short usage I cannot comment on this. The fittings / connections seem acceptable so I don't expect to have any problems in the near future."
2,Broke almost immediately,Seems like a decent hose reel as long as you don't have too heavy of a hose. I put a 100' semi-heavy duty hose and it broke on the first use. Probably would be OK with a regular light-duty garden hose.
3,Suncast SWA100,"This was a replacement for a previous model. It's fine, but less hose capacity than the previous model."
2,Meets the minimum functional requirements but low grade,"1. The short hose connecting to the hose bib is cheap and I expect it will fail pretty quick.2. Can't get a pliers into the center of the base/spindle where the connector hose screws to the rotating part...gotta take it completely off the wall if it needs attention.3. Mounting holes in the base are not slotted allowing the screws be only loosened to lift it off for cleaning out the spiders, crud, etc. Gotta take the screws completely out of the wall, meaning after a few times the holes will expand or strip and need larger screws or new holes.4. No hose guide means you have to be careful winding the hose so it doesn't pile up; takes two hands.5. The locking piece that holds the reel on the spindle seems awfully thin and light. The reel is fairly loose and wobbly on the spindle and too light plastic feels like it'll break easily; this one isn't going to last the 20 years I got from my stout old Ames unit."
1,Hose Reel,"Bought this hose reel a year ago, lasted one season with water connections failing. Typical of most hose reels. Going back to good old metal hanger."
5,Vintage Waugh,"It's vintage Waugh, standing halway between the farcical funny ones and the serious ones. He's unique in being a satirist of the idiocy of war who can also deal with patriotism and courage.This is set in that strange time when Britain had just gone to war but France had not fallen. You meet some characters from his other books. This added to the pleasure for me but I don't know if it's the one I would recommend to someone who'd never read any Waugh before. It also helps if you know something about the 1930's British literary scene and can recognize who is being satirized. Parsnip and Pimpernell are presumably Auden and Spender. I've heard of various candidates fir being Ambose Silk."
3,Put Out More Flags,I was listening to NPR and the author being interviewed mentioned how much he enjoyed reading this book. I suggested it to my Book Club. I think it was rather humorous but not as funny as I had expected it to be.
4,Book review,Not much out of the way from a lot of other cookbooks but has some good standards and lots of nice little quotes.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the cookbook. After reading ALL her books on the Amish, I expected something totally different. The recipes are not the authentic old order amish, which is what I wanted. They're all modern day recipes."
5,Amish Heritage Cookbook,"I am very pleased with the cookbook. It has alot of good recipes in it that I have tried, and alot more that I want to try. Also I like the little notes that are in the book. It gives you a feeling of being right there in an Amish community. I am very much into cooking and baking from scratch. I recomend this book for anyone that likes Beverly Lewis books and cooking. As in her books not being disappointed with her writings you will also enjoy the cookbook. This was the first item I ever ordered off of Amazon.com, I am so pleased with the product, and the service with them that I have ordered more items from Amazon.com and continue to be pleased with the items and the service."
1,Oxford bench,Buyer beware. You will be shown a charge of 329.00. Then when it come it is $413.11. It is not worth the 329. Came with a large white chalky scratch on front. Parts not drill in correct place. Cam-locks hard to use. Cushion is cheat and dirty. Screws to short for handles. Will never order anything again that involves Home Decorators.
4,Modernized Miss Marple - getting better in the role,"This latest series from Geraldine McEwan is better than previous as she gets more into the role of Miss Marple, making extensive use of her bird-like head tilts and enquiring expressions. Her knitting skills are improving too but most improtantly for Christie buffs, the script is less salacious and sexually bizarre. The sexual side is still there for discerning viewers but no so in-your-face as the earlier series. Of course the scripts have suffered considerable re-writes but are generally still recognizable. Special applause given for the costumes and sets - nicely in the period. Enjoyable viewing overall."
4,Miss Marple 3,Excellent seller. Fast delivery and item received was just as described. Would buy again from this seller.
2,Two and a half stars...,"Geraldine McEwen is a wonderful actress, but the current BBC production doesn't serve her well. Everything is wonderful except the scripts, which are often ludicrous. With such wonderful material as the Marple novels, why do the screen writers deviate from them so gratuitously, often turning the plots into gibberish? Try the Joan Hickson Marple films. With no disrespect to Ms. McEwen, Ms. Hickson was the perfect Jane, and the plots of these Christie stories were not nearly so badly mauled."
4,Miss Marple Strikes Again,"This is the second of three series of Miss Marple to appear on PBS. This one stats Geraldine McEwan, who does a very good job playing the part. The series is excellant and I recommend this set as very entertaining. Sit back and watch some very good TV>"
5,Intriging to the End,"The best way to relax is to sit down with a hot cup of coffee and Miss Marple. She is so unassuming and clever. Each detective she meets views her as a snoopy, little old lady until she reveals to them, the master sleuth that she is. Then, it is all over, as Miss Marple puts all the pieces together. She gathers the suspects and often painstakingly, offers up the murderer. What will she do next??"
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book is more of a guide to the development process. I wanted something that would tell me about the features of the RAD tool, such as what do all those little icons mean? When I inadvertently close a window, how do i get it back? I guess I need a RAD for Dummies, but i haven't found that yet."
1,Errors Galore!,"On page one it states that it is ""aimed at beginners who want to quickly and easily learn to use Rational Application Developer"". Beginners beware. I can't remember reading a textbook-like book that has as many errors as this one does. I'm only up to page 65 and I've found 23 errors or inconsistencies. And, eight of the 65 pages I did not read. How many errors are there in the next 539 pages. I question whether this book was ""proofed"". I am amazed and disappointed that the IBM Press published a book with this level of quality. My experience with this book so far makes me wonder whether I should purchase any more books from IBM Press in the future. I'd sure like to get my money back on this one."
2,"Tutorial on target, but a lack of technical proofing","I admit that this book is right on target for how it is structured for people to learn the fundamentals from the ground up. It follows a natural learning format from beginning to end. However, the book is riddled with programming inconsistences and errors. For example, you are left to figure out parameters that are named one way, but are written differently on another page for the same program (see page 48 => arg2.doFilter should be chain.doFilter). Also, there are instances where the book tells you that you will find certain things within a perspective, but when using the IDE, you find the book is not accurate (see page 57=>cannot see Servlets tab when double-clicking on the Web Perspective Deployment Descriptor, but it is in the Java Perspective when you double-click the Web.xml file). The book was written in a hurry, it appears, and is really for a developer who can see the mistakes and correct them on the fly when going through the tutorials."
3,Almost a great tool,"I am using this book for a class which is requiring us to go through all of the tutorials.Pros-You will gain decent experience with writing java servlets, database apps and XML.Cons-We are using the most recent version of RAD so some of the pictures in the book are not exactly the same, but they are close enough for you to figure it out the steps you need to take. The tutorials do well at teaching their topics (writing an xml file, java servlets, filters, etc.) but they do not explain a lot about RAD itself. Many times I could not get a tutorial to work because of something as trivial as a setting with the server that they forgot to mention in the tutorial. Be prepared to be frustrated with some of them."
3,"Great concept, poor quality control","I love everything about Boggle To Go, except that fact that the cover, which is supposed to stay on (since it is the ""to go"" model) will not stay on securely. Other than that, I love that the pencils and paper store in the bottom."
3,King of the Surf Guitar,"Nice playing by one of the original speed merchants. The sound leaves a little to be desired, in that there is some hiss that translates to the disk from the original recordings."
5,Dick Dale man!,"I wish that Amazon would allow cursing in these comments...! I feel that it would express my emotion and excitement for this album way more dramatically than without. Buy this album, and buy it on vinyl. There is no greater way to listen to Dick Dale, or anyone for that matter, than held down to vinyl.BUY FOOLS!!!"
2,So disappointed!,"I can't tell unsuspecting readers and would-be remodelers how disappointed I was in this book. I bought the book for ideas for our major remodelling. In particular, I was looking for great pictures of clever, contemporary ideas for our sons' bedrooms and for our family room. The pictures in the book are very poor quality, grainy and faded, and most appear to have been taken well before the mid-Nineties. This book was published in 1997; it's now 2000. Why would I want to look at a room clearly designed for and in the 70's? What's with the crocheted pillow (p. 149)? I suspect that room has long since been RE-modeled. While I did enjoy the historical background on Gusbav Stickley's Structural Furnishings, I certainly didn't feel inspired by the already-dated examples of ""contemporary"" interpretations. While I am sure that Jim Tolpin is a competent carpenter, his taste and presentation are NOT for the style-conscious."
3,Not a How-To Book,This is mainly a picture book rather than Tolpin's usual instruction manual. While the photos are quite interesting and the book has some good ideas on space usage this is closer to a decorating book than a woodworking book.This would be helpful as a what-if book for building a new home or a remodel. Otherwise it's not particularly useful.
4,Just What it Promises: Design IDEAS,"No, it's not a woodworking book with instructions for how to build the pieces pictured. It's a book of executed ideas that one may use for your own designs. I have the soft cover, which is better than the hardcover, if judged by the reviews. I love the history of built-ins and the great pictures. The text is wrapped around the pictures and great pleasure reading. He does show some things, such as: how to create a pattern to ensure the piece fits, how to scribe a foundation so the piece rests levelly on an imperfect floor, how to use trim to hide gaps of varying width, or make a strong joint. This book will help you come up with your own pieces or adapt the designs in the book to your space but you will need another book, or a woodworker, to build them."
2,Pass on this one,"I was extrememly dissapointed by this novel. I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys when they finally caught the good guy! The plot had potential -- US & Chinese politics, WMDs, a Mideast connection, etc., but the characters are really hard to believe. It seems like the bad guys are everywhere, watching everything, and only the hero is clueless. Narrow escape after narrow escape, the reader isn't inspired by the hero's dedication, instead, you are left stunned by his stupidity.If you are a Ludlum fan, pass this one up. There are better choices."
5,The Altman Code,"This book is a great read, like all of Robert Ludlum's. I like the Covert-One novels the best of all his series. If you like action and suspense, this is a great book for you."
2,Not Ludlum's Best Work,"This has got to be one of Ludlum's worst. Gayle Lynds must have written most of it. It's hard to beleive that there would be an agent in the field as inept as Jon Smith. This agent's performance is so bad, he shouldn't be in any covert organization, even the fictional ones! If it wasn't for luck and the skills of other agents (including one really smart female), he'd been dead in chapter one!! It should be criminal to create a covert agent with such ineptness. He can't retrieve documents without getting caught or beat half to death. He couldn't subdue one guard while helping the President's estranged father escape. The whole novel is about the star character screwing up! Shame on you RL for putting your name on this novel. This is the last time I buy a novel based on the author's reputation."
1,Beware of this substandard effort.,"If you're a Ludlum fan, like I am, you will be acutely disappointed in this bomb. After the likes of The Sigma Protocol and The Janson Directive, this one is about as interesting as watching the tide come in. It starts with a hackneyed premise of terrorist weapon materials being transported to China, then comes to a grinding halt as the ""story"" stagnates for hundreds of pages, going on and on, with no advancement of the plot whatsoever, like a car stuck in the mud."
2,Spy thriller? try Snooze fest,"This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and I am seriously disappointed. I don't know that I'll even finish it. Characters have literally had the same conversations multiple times, as if the author isnt sure we were paying attention and they better summarize the plot again, just to be safe. The writing itself just tries to hard and is, in a word, lame. Sample line: ""He crossed the room to the sink and picked up the dish liquid, Dawn, and poured some in the sink."" Like we need to what brand of dish soap it is(!)?From the summary on the jacket, this novel sounded promising. Instead, I'm fighting to stay awake, not caring if they ever catch the bad guys. 2 out 5 stars because I've managed to hang on more than half way."
2,Material seems very dated.,"There is a reason this book is shrink-wrapped - to prevent you from finding out that most of the photos are from the 1980's. The pictures in here are like travelling in a time warp. Anyone planning a wedding today would find limited fodder for inspiration, given the fact that the highlighted weddings are 10 years old. The text is OK, but not very creative. I found myself double checking the publication date to see if it said 1986 instead of 1996. Definitely not worth the high price. Colin Cowie's book is much more current and beautiful."
1,terrible,"her book is full of posh weddings that are out of reach for the majority of couples. As a professional wedding consultant, I will not ever have this book available for reference"
3,A Quick Adventure,Henriette is a 14 inch porcelain doll from France. Her original owner has now become the older grandmother of an orphaned granddaughter she cannot care for. Henriette is determined to make it to the child's orphanage in post Civil War Georgia and she hops a plantation wagon on its way to the city. This 63 page book has short chapters and the story moves quickly. It is a decently written adventure for 6 to 9 year olds.
2,Yo!,"This song wins worse lyrics award from me. It sends a very lame message and makes absalutly no sense at some points. On the other hand it's fun to listen to and has a nice beat. I'd never play this by myself, or if I had a choice, there are far better songs out there. For a party, this is great. At parties, nobody cares what the lyrics are. Hope this is helpful, PEACE OUT!"
2,Good light with problems,This picture frame light works well but has some problems. The included batteries were dead requiring immediate additional cost. The battery bracket holding the batteries required tightening. The adjustment screws to align the light with the picture did not work as the stem was painted and could not be moved. A good product that needs better manufacturing.
2,Not what I expected,"Given that Mr. Beltram is vaguely associated (listed in the thank-yous) with countless big names in electronica (i.e. Prodigy and listed on Hardfloor's ""Respect""), I had high hopes for this album. Perhaps it's not a suitable introduction, but from what I gather, this is the sound of a pioneer who lost pace with the imitators. Especially for 1996, the tracks are painfully repetitive and formulaic. Maybe I'm just desensitized, expecting every track to build to a break, but none of these seem to go anywhere. Too many sounds, most highly electronic, span entire tracks unchanged, like a higher-energy Plastikman sound that trips over itself. My usual vinyl complaint applies here: there is a paltry 45 minutes of material here. ""Loose kick"" and ""The view"" were the most listenable to me, but the standard five-minute track gets close to grating. Sadly, this nearly nullifies the likelihood of my seeking anything else. For purists only."
1,Rates a C+ as a high school essay.,"I like ""cute"" but 300 pages of it? The author quaintly refers to his map as his ""cartographicus magnus,"" not once, but for 300 pages. His high school text, ""A Guide To Colorful Writing,"" was heavily used as evidenced by this typical sentence:""After a major interlude of rest and relaxation in our very own home just north of Boston, after sunny days followed by damp and drizzly ones, after a wallow in middle-aged domesticity followed by a shallow impatience with it, after a dozen serious dog walks and a thousand gentle strokes on the canine cranium, at last we put down our collective foot and raised Storyville's second leg."" The book was published by the University of Georgia Press. Why?"
1,"""A COMMERCIAL DISSAPOINTMENT""","""A Commercial Dissapointment"" raves the Osborn's own hometown newspaper ""Deseret News"", and I would have to agree. This whole album is pretty bubble-gum pop-country, and not at all as good as their first.The Flower-Sisters better be careful or the Chicks will bump them even further down the road to retirement."
2,What happened to this group?,"This album was terrible compared to their first album. They need to decide what genre of music they are going to fall into. I also saw them in concert and they were terrible. They were the feature act at the Butler County Fair in Hamilton, Ohio and they only played for about 45 minutes and sounded awful. I later saw Tracy Byrd at the same location and he was great!"
1,Stop the Insanity!,"I'd recommend buying something else that's either country OR pop.. not THIS. This doesn't even really sound like their first album. Yes, artists can change their sound.. but this is insane! They've totally changed their style: it's POP.Maybe download a song or two from this album before you invest in this sad attempt to re-vitalize their careers.. or buy this CD used (see above.. there are PLENTY to go around!). I'd like to recommend buying an album more worthy of being counrty. This album really SHE-BOMBED when it comes to the charts and in my opinion, these gals need to decide to either compete with the POP stars or the Country favorites."
5,Great!,This cd is great! I never really liked Shedaisy till now... The cd has slow ballads and some poppy ballads... it is a rollercoaster of emotions and I recommend it to everyone.. This is by far their best!!!
5,OH WOW!!!,"I have been a HUGE fan of SHeDAISY ever since I heard them on the radio. When the new CD, Knock on the Sky came out, I rushed right over to the store. I have NOT been disapointed with the CD. It is awesome! (especially the 2nd song.)"
3,Coming along.....,"I admit - this album is not nearly as solid as their first - but it still has promise.I loved ""Mine all Mine"", ""All Over You"", ""I Wish I Were the Rain"" and several others. The music is still wonderful to sing and dance to in my kitchen and on the road.Expecting soaring performances and comparison against an already-well established Dixie Chicks is a little narrow - considering the very few female trios in the industry right now. SheDaisy is still beginning, and has proven much in a short amount of time.Can't wait to hear more!!"
3,SheDaisy Falls Out Of A Bland SKY,"The proper follow-up to SheDaisy's debut finds the girls going for a far more straightforward musical approach, that being one of utterly faceless--not to mention lazy--songwriting and production. The fun and spark found throughout THE WHOLE SHEBANG is all but missing-in-action here(with the exception of first single 'Get Over Yourself'), and Kristyn Osborn, whose clever lyrical approach on the previous set was highly reminiscent of the very fine Matraca Berg, seems to have lost whatever edge she may have previously possessed. It goes without saying that the singing is first-rate, and there more than a couple very decent, if slightly derivative, tracks ( the aforementioned 'Get Over Yourself', as well as 'Man Goin Down', 'I'm Lit' and 'Rush'). But there are very few real gems in a program that seems to want to please country radio playlists and ulimately just comes off as stone-cold boring."
3,Just wanted to say...,"I just wanted to say that this CD does not, nor does Shedaisy's last CD, sound like anything related to Britney Spears. I laughed out loud when I read that in the Amazon.com editorial. Why is it that if you even have anything to do with music nowadays, you qualify for the title Britney Spears Wanna-be? She didn't invent music itself, you know, and she didn't even begin pop music. No more using that cliche comparison, please. Any ways, I love listening to the Shedaisy sisters harmonize, because they have beautiful voices, BUT I liked their last CD better."
5,My Revieew of KOTS,"Well I never listen to the Critics about anything, Music, Movies etc. I Like this CD alot. Who cares what the Critics think anyway. We're the ones that are buying the Stuff not them lol. The songs that I like the most on Knock on the Sky are:Mine all MineThe First to let goMan going downI'm LitI wish I were the RainNowI like them all but those are the ones I like the most."
5,Love this new cd,"I love this new cd. It's hard to pick a favorite song because all of the songs are so good. Definately, give this cd a chance! You won't regret it!"
1,*GAG* me with a Daisy,"This album sounds like it was rushed. The vocals lack power on this album.. it's almost like ""Wilson Phillips"". This CD marks themselves as a One-Cd-Wonder (their first album was much MUCH better).I should have bought the Chick's or Faith Hill's new album. I suggest you buy ""Knock the Sky"" used (there are plenty). I'm putting mine up for sale."
1,Country or Not..,"It doesn't really matter if this was supposed to be country, pop, or whatever in between. This album is certainly not nearly as appealing as their 1st.As comparison.. SheDaisy is to the Dixie Chicks as Paula Abdul is to Janet Jackson. Think about it.. they put out a ""remix"" album (country does remix??) after their 1st album, apparantly to sell a few more records. Didn't turn out as well as they thought.And neither has this album. Without a top 10 single in sight, SheDaisy has no need to Knock On The Sky.. it's quite obvious the people are knocking on the music store doors for something other than this album!One star for a disappointment. Sorry gals! You may be kinda cute, but that won't make this one sell for you!"
2,Knocking on the Floor,"I LOVED Shedaisy's first album The Whole Shebang. And I also really enjoy their Christmas albumn. They have beautiful voices and I love the three part harmonies they come up with. I was very excited to get their newest album but I was sure dissapointed. This is a very dark and depressing album. Almost every song is about lost love. Also, all the songs but 1 are slow. Where is the upbeat Shedaisy I fell in love with??? I would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to The Whole Shebang again. Still, I look forward to what the future may bring from them. These sisters have alot of talent!"
4,the only country I listen to,dont know what happened to them but i do like most of there cds and the lead singer is hot saw them on drew carey and loved them from that point on and I hate county as a whole but these girls can sing
2,More Country Flavor needed,SheDaisy is not heading down a very successful road right now there music is to pop for country. I'm not one of those complaining traditionalists or anything I love Today's Country Music but SheDaisy really needs to put some pure down home country sound in their music. The album has not produced any hits on the radio my radio station refuses to play these gals and I do not blame them. They are a very attractive cute group of girls though but they have a chance to fix themselves to put some country in there music and that is all they really need to do they should sound like another Highway 101 or Trick Pony then their videos would get played and they would have hits. Knock on the Sky is full of lousy songs with bad beat and it sounds like they are headed in a Britney Spears/Leann Rimes/Shania Twain road please girls do not do that we have enough of silly music out there right now what we really need is some real southern style music.
3,Major let down from The Whole Shebang,"Compared to the first CD, this one is horrid. It's manufactured and fake. The first CD was awesome and they do have a ton of talent, however this CD doesn't really show it. As far as the writing goes, the slow songs all sound the same and the fast songs are even more similar to each other...also several of the songs sound just like songs from the first CD, which is a nice try, but sad. Mine All Mine, I Wish I Were The Rain, Rush, and Keep Me are the best reasons, THE ONLY REASONS, to buy this CD. They're not country anymore they've been sucked into the pop world. If you think you want to buy a SheDaisy CD buy The Whole Shebang, and borrow Knock On The Sky from a friend before buying it for yourself."
1,Country-what?,"This album is more Country-Pop than Shania Twain. If SheDaisy wants pop, then they need to have their label re-distribute their CDs. I was COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED after buying this that it was sounding like POP and NOT like their other album.Gals, make up your minds! Good grief, I hoped that maybe one song on here was country, but I couldn't find one...And what'up with the hair-dye, Kassidy?1 star for a big disappointment. The reason this isn't dominating the charts is because IT ISN'T SELLING!"
1,Better Knock On WOOD,"With their new single found nowhere on the Billboard top 10 charts, and with an album whose position on ""Billboard"" quickly peaked and now falling, SheDaisy, or their label, may want to reconsider making an album like this again. This sounds much too poppy to be considered country at all.(Kassidy, why did you dye your hair again?)Also, a new Dixie Chicks album will be released in August (their single is hot and still holding steady in the Billboard Top 10).SheDaisy should admit this project to be a disappointment to fans and bad timing when it comes to record release.. to go against a rival like the Chicks.. I mean, hello... I for one am taking this to the used CD store for a credit to buy the next Chicks album.And SheDaisy will not blow the Chicks out of the water. Get real! The charts, CD Sales, and sold-out shows speak for themselves."
5,Almost perfect,"Is pretty well built and pretty safe. The only UL listed set-up for a heat lamp. My only concern is that the cage spaces the ""lamp"" out too far. Since it cannot be mounted in the enclosure and the surface must be screened, it must of neccesity sit on the top of the enclosure, thus spacing the heating element a ways back where any draft can intervene. I suppose radiant heat is unaffected, but on our tall 15 gallon set-up it barely raises the temperature at all (which is good in our case)."
3,It works,"The pivot is weird: a cylindrical shape pressed between two lips which need to be tightened by a screw. Once you do realize that's what's intended by design (documentation is non-existing and the picture on the box is somewhat misleading, showing something that looks like 2 tightening screws), it just works.Another thing that I didn't like was that the range of the angle between the arm and the lamp itself is limited and, as a result, the lamp can't be directed horizontally. A longer arm would have provided a wider adjustment range.I'd have given this 5 stars if they provided good documentation and a longer arm."
3,Clamp lamp for snake cage,Bought two. Worked great for about two years. One of the lamps on/off switch broke rendering the lamp useless. Other one still workng fine.
3,A Thoughtful Series,"Give Your Body Up is an interesting collection of discs. It achieves its aim of preserving foundational songs essential to the progression of modern dance club music. The discs contain rareties that are difficult to find elsewhere. Each disc in the series, this one in particular, may cover too much ground and have too much variety. There was a good bit of difference stylistically between the Philly Sound and string/horn drenched dance music of the 70's on the one hand and the synth-based, drum machine sound of the early and mid 80's on the other. Both decades are intermixed, not in chronological order. So we find the organic, gospel-inflected ""Over and Over"" next to the electronic ""BRA,"" the orchestral ""Love Is The Message"" alongside the reggae-laced ""Now That We've Found Love."" As a source for songs, however, this series is definitely different from those ""Disco"" sets that focus on radio hits."
2,Save your money,"Touch and Go and Love is The Message was the only reason to give the cd 2 stars, it is really not worth buying maybe you can find other cd's w/ above listed songs w/ better choices.Save your money!"
5,Great Children's Music,This CD (and its prequel - 50 All-Time Children's Favorites 1)has been my son's favorite CD. He has all of the songs memorized and has even the track numbers memorized with the songs! The songs are very cute. Something that really sets this CD apart from others is that each song is sung by a child.
1,confusing controls,"With 20/20 vision in bright light, it is very difficult to read the switches that switch between cd and radio. Two switches must be set correctly to switch between radio and cd. If you're only going to use it for one use, radio or cd then it's ok, but if you want both, do this test. Look at the unit in the store, imagine you're in bed in dim light and try to switch between cd and radio modes. If you can do it, buy it."
2,not as advertised,"Audiovox claims some sort of ""weekend alarm"" and the description here indicates that this is the sort of clock alarm which you can set to go off only on the weekdays, thus saving you long suffering roommate from being blasted out of bed early in the morning on a Saturday when you are out of town. sadly it does not do this. it, like many alarm clocks, has two alarms. you can set them manually, but the alarm has no idea what day of the week it is. we are going to return it."
5,don't wait for the kick cause it's not intended,"You know, i've now read two 'rock journalist' reviews of this album that kvetched about this being dull or not 'kicking in' when they wanted it to and all I have to say is that those two rock journalists will never know true love. This album soothes and coats and relaxes and invigorates, like good aromatherapy, or Stomach EZ Tea. Provided you're not the sort who will wring her hands just waiting for the big circus of drums and bass and samples and complexity to 'kick in' you'll be just fine. In fact you'll love it."
4,Pie In My Face,"I was fired from my FIRST job for ""not suggesting pies."" Okay, I was only 16, but I was devastated AND confused. I worked at a cheesy little steakhouse in Alexandria, VA, called The Ponderosa, for about $1.25 an hour. When it came time for me to move ""up"" from biscuits to pies in the cafeteria line, apparently someone caught me not pushing the fruit pies. The Head Rangler came over and told me I was fired and to leave immediately; I'd have to go out in broad daylight wearing my little cowgirl outfit and six-guns. I remember calling my Dad at work to ask him to pick me up. He came immediately, but it felt like hours, sitting on the curb in front of the steak joint crying my eyes out and wondering if I'd ever get another job."
3,"Fun, but not useful for real people","If you're a regular person who got fired from normal full-time job looking to get inspiration or find the humor from others suffering the same, this book is not for you. This book is mostly collection of anecdotes from show biz people, people who are routinely unemployed between gigs for whom getting hired and fired is a huge fact of life. So...cute stories, a good light read. There's still an opportunity out there for someone to really write this book."
4,"Quick, amusing","A quick, amusing read of true stories (mostly by comedians and entertainment writers) about getting fired"
1,Contains PVC and not suitable for bath,"Toys should not be made with PVC - the poison plastic. It has such harmful effects on the reproductive system of kids that it should not be used in any event, especially not in the bath. Clearly, the company manufacturing these toys has no regard for the health and welfare of our kids. Stay away."
4,Marine setr for kids,This was a decent little set for my 3 year old. He love steh squid and shjarks and ray. If you rkid is just starting to like this sort of thing it was a good starter set to show him/her some things.
4,Only one complaint...,"These toys are great. They are large, easily handled and have accurate detail for the animal depicted. The only problem is the awful smell of the PVC. I soaked them for a couple of hours in a vinegar/water solution. I also tried baking soda. I finally left them outside for awhile to air out. No way I would've given them to my son to play with smelling like that. They did finally air out. Luckily he didn't see them while I was going through the effort to rid them of the odor."
5,Great for the price,"Would definitely buy them again. BUT there are only 11 pieces, not 12. I compared to the picture and there are only 11 pictured as well."
4,Good book for digital painting,"Ive done just about everything else with photoshop and wanted a good book on digital painting so I could use my traditional art skills in that way. Its a good amount of content for the price and it has some really nice tips on creating your own brushes. The tutorials are pretty much step by step, although a little more info would have been nice. A lot of the process depends on your own ability and experience with the pen and tablet. So, overall I'd say its a good resource."
1,GARBAGE DOESN'T WORK,THIS IS THE WORST SURGE PROTECTOR I HAVE EVER OWNED. IT TURNS MY EQUIPMENT OFF ALMOST EVERY DAY FOR NO REASON. I RESET IT AND SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND SOMETIMES IT DOESNT. I HAVE STOPPED USING IT AND IM USING THE OLD ONE AND IT WORKS GREAT. JUNK!!
1,a .naimian,this Power Sentry Do sent work well and I want to return & change with new one please tell me how??
5,love this tea pot,"This is a very good quality tea pot. I like how the lid is removable, it makes cleaning so much easier. Plus it is very cute!"
3,Bee House Round Teapot,This teapot is nice but very small and too expensive for what you get. I saw one exactly the same (different mfg.) at a kitchen store for half the price as this one.
3,good for sound effects cd's,"Alot of scary unique sounds for making your own soundtracks or for halloween prop builders.There are also some situation tracks here,that are designed for themes.Decent cd for a decent price.I got this to add some new sounds to my sound effect library."
2,Stop scaring me!,"This CD is broken up into several parts. It starts off with extended ""scary"" sequences, which are each several minutes long. The sequences are: a girl's nightmare, a ghost ship, a seance and weird sound effects. Next, we have several horror related messages that are designed for answering machines. Then, there are several messages that are designed as sounds for the computer. The rest of the CD features sound effects taken from the first four tracks on this disc. The tracks here are pretty well done, but I don't think this CD is of much use as a ""sound effects"" disc."
4,Good Character Building,"Heard about this and decided to watch and was pulled into the lives of the characters - which is what I like about good movies, building the story and characters - making you like them and their situations. Recommend to all."
2,I TRADED IT IN.,ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I COULDN'T FINISH WATCHING THE SERIES. I GAVE IT TO A FRIEND TO WATCH. THEY COULDN'T FINISH EITHER. I SENT IT BACK AS A TRADE IN.
3,Rainshadow,"I have no complaints bout the dealer and Amazon.com because they both followedthrough as dependable as usual. However, I couldn't really get into the storyeven though I gave it a fair chance. It seemed very depressing."
5,great story-,the series is interesting and imaginative-great scenes in Australia-loved both women-can't wait to see the next series-enjoy the vet theme
5,Rain Shadow: Series One,"I originally viewed this movie on a rented DVD.I loved it so much, I purchased it as a gift for my adult daughter.Anyone who likes a good movie will like this one!"
4,"Chiquititas,.. a classic from Argentina","Chiquititas is the only soap opera for children in latin america with more than 7 years,.. from 1995 to 2001,.. this cd is from the 2006 season.. these are new versions of songs from the past years,.. Chiquititas was created by Cris Morena,.. the REAL creator of Rebelde Way phenomenon,.. but the mexican version is the most succesful show and its pop band (RBD) are the new sensation of latin pop music of the worldChiquititas was the begining... a group of orphans and a beautiful magic lady called Lili,.. share many adventours with humour, drama and many songs... Chiquititas is a classic of the latin american television.. This cd is for all ages.. specially for the little girls..(Chiquititas in english)"
1,does not work,I would like to say I am so happy to have it if it works but I am sorry that I bought this item!!! Be aware!!!
5,Fantastic,"I actually bought this as an album when I was a senior in HS in the 1970s. I was a big fan of Busby Berkely musicals back then, still am. When music went CD, I was not able to find a copy. I was able to find a few clips here and there at file sharing websites, but never the whole thing. Finally found this!! Yay!!! Good stuff: I Only Have Eyes For You, Shanghai Lil, Young and Healthy, My Forgotten Man and so many more favorites! I highly recommend it."
3,"Idiomatic Music, Poor Sound","There is no question as to the enjoyment that this 2-CD album provides in terms of the great music and performances found in the Busby Berkeley Warner Bros. movies. My only complaint is the rather poor sound quality found on these discs. I realize that the music is from a pre-high fidelity age, however I have heard wonders done with these older sources when restoration attempts are made. In this case, sadly, no restoration is evident. The music sounds as though it were recorded off a VHS tape. That is a pity because there is much here to enjoy. If you can overlook the inferior sound, I can recommend this set."
5,Listen up Parents - Dr. Cohen knows his stuff!,After reading The Attention Zone it is odvious that Dr. Cohen is undoubtedly the leader in his field. Clinical discriptions and a no non-sence style of writing creates a masterpiece that easily understood and equaly helpful to docters and parents alike.
3,"Machines, si; people, no","While this is an improvement over the previous 'recorded in a blimp hangar' sound of ""Sheet One"", the tracks here still tend toward the nothing much going on mode, whereas there's so much better out there in terms of acid and techno in general. Things often go on much too long, or don't have enough there to sustain interest. Granted, yes, this would all work much better if it was in the hands of a DJ, perhaps...but that being said, it would also be better to have about half of this release on a couple of 12""s and toss some of the more self-indulgent parts of this into the edit-room bin. At least Richie turned the reverb down...although later, it does come back up on subsequent (and, I feel, less competent) offerings."
5,Perfection,My parents and I have watched a scratchy copy of the original PBS airing nearly every Christmas for the past 18 years. There's never been a Christmas TV special or film better than this one. Sheer perfection.
5,This is a masterful film; it completely embraces and celebrates the sentimental warmth of Christmases past.,"The sights, sounds, tastes and smells of (seemingly) ancient family gatherings at Christmas are captured so perfectly in this film of Dylan Thomas' classic poem that you walk away from each viewing with a wonderful feeling of contentedness. This should be a part of every family's holiday collection."
5,A Child's Christmas in Wales,"This is a beautiful re-telling of Dylan Thomas's classic tale. Though not filmed in Cardiff the setting is close enough to be believeable and the words are pure magic. It's a ""must see"" each Christmas season in our house and gets better each time we see it."
5,True Welsh Christmas story,This is a Canadian film shot in Wales about the Dylan Thomas book of the same name. It is filled with traditional Christmas music and follows the book very closely. I would recommend this DVD for any family but especially ones with a heritage of the English isles or one with children. A wonderful look back at Christmas's long ago.One of my favorite films guaranteed to get me the Christmas spirit.
4,Living a CHILD'S CHRISTMAS IN WALES,"This lovely, sensitive interpretation of Dylan Thomas's poem is loyal to the original, but adds appropriate dialogue and a wonderland of touching pictures and characters. We have viewed it for the first time and are drawn into the film at every new frame. It seems just right for all ages and makes one quite nostalgic for the days of our youth and those special times with family and friends when small towns and simple acts meant love was every where around us. We recommend it."
5,An absolute Christmas jewel,"We discovered this movie when it was first shown. It quickly becamse a family classic and we have watched it every Christmas Eve since. What a joy to find that this movie is finally available on DVD. I have bought a copies for my mother, four children, and a good friend.It is hard to describe this movie. The poetry of Dylan Thomas combines with the images and story of the film in such a powerful imaginative way that I doubt I will ever want to just read the poem by itself.There are so many classic moments. Perhaps one of my favorites is the four boys going up to the old man's door to sing carols. They try singing Good King Wenceslas but are frightened away by the haunting whispery singing on the other side of the door.I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. Buy a copy for yourself and buy multiple copies to give to families, friends, and lovers. Let this movie become part of your Christmas."
4,Lovely little film,"This beginning to be one of my favorite Christmas movies. When I'm getting too overwhelmed with a modern Christmas - the consumerism, the excessiveness of it all - I can put this movie on and get swept back to a time when Christmas was simple and, as seen through a child's eyes, wonderous. This movie captures the book's charm and expands upon it. The one downside is that it is a bit slow-paced, however, that might make it the perfect movie to show the children Christmas Eve to make them sleepy."
5,A Christmas Treat,"I first saw this video on public television years ago and am delighted that it is now available. In a way, it reminds me of the old TV versions of Jean Sheperd's radio stories. Think about translating a Jean Sheperd story to another, perhaps more understated culture. Definitely worth purchasing."
5,Yes!,"I have loved, and listened, to Dylan Thomas's own recording, of ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" for years. Despite the British seaside setting, it conjurs up my own memories of childhood Christmases on the farm in Kansas... right down to the uncles and aunties. I got this movie version with a little apprehension, but was delighted. Next Christmas it will go to a certain beloved 10-year-old, with the hope that in good time she will know and feel Christmas like it is known and felt here."
5,Nice memories,A Child's Christmas in Wales is a favorite of our family and we were delighted to be able to get a new copy of it.
5,Heartwarming Story,"I love to watch Christmas celebrated around the world, and very pleased to have this one in my collection. Put a log on the fire and enjoy!"
3,Just OK,"I am from England and fell in love with the title of this movie, however, I thought it was a little boring. In fact I feel asleep while watching it! My kids (20 and 26) also watched it and felt it was cute."
2,Sweet but slow,"This was a sweet film but wouldn't hold the attention of young children. I enjoyed it for it's old fashioned qualities, however, I cannot see myself watching it multiple times."
5,Good game for a good price,"This is by far the best game Ubi Soft has come out with. Other games like Gunfighter and Largo Winch don't even come close to being as good as Planet of the Apes. The graphics are as good as they get on playstation, even better than c-12 final resistance. It's hard to beleive that a brand new playstation game that is so good sells for so cheap. Go get it now!!!!!"
2,Mediocre Reproductions,"I could not quite decide whether to give this book 2 or 3 stars. I decided on 2, because of my disappointment with the quality of the reproductions--mediocre reproductions of otherwise beautiful paintings. That is not to say the book is worthless. It has considerable value as an illustrated overview of this subject; but you will need to look elsewhere to see a truer depiction of the beauty of these paintings.This book's reproductions are not necessarily worse than those found in many other (most other?) art books. I'm just bemoaning that this book, like far too many others, does not display paintings in any way close to true color, depth of color, or brilliance, etc.There must be valid reasons for such low-quality reproductions (e.g., higher quality might translate into too-high book prices); regardless of the reason, though, it is fair to point out the low quality. Maybe publishers can find a way to do better."
4,awesome,This was a great season especially since some of the episodes that weren't on tv are on the dvd. i recommend to any degrassi fan who missed what happened when manny found out she was pregnant.
4,"great episodes, horrible features","ill agree with the above poster to say that yes, buy it if you're a huge fan and want to add it to your collection, if you're buying it for the features, DON'T. The deleted scenes only includes just over 30 versus season 2's 130, no bloopers, no casting auditions (jay, alex, chris, amy anyone?)"
4,Good,"It's a good product, better than i expected... It works well in soft and hard wood, holding and penetration are excellent in low movement forniture."
3,"Good, but limited","I purchased both the Enduro and the regular Voit playground balls for our school. These did hold up a little bit longer than the regular ones, but they were too hard (with not enough ""give"") for games like dodgeball and handball -- even when not pumped up all the way. Next time I'll just order the regular balls -- they lasted about 2 months (whereas these were closer to 3) but got much more use. That's about average for a school-yard ball. I'm sure you can expect longer for home use."
2,Voit 8 1/2in Multicolor Enduro Series Playground Balls Color: Yellow,"Voit 8 1/2in Multicolor Enduro Series Playground Balls Color: Yellow. Ball was inflated by hand air pump, quickly became out if round. For the price I would have expected more. But is too inexpensive to return for credit/exchange"
5,A quality STEAL at this price - definitely worth a look,"This screen is a really excellent value, esp. at this price (even with the shipping charge added on, since it's an odd-shaped item). I got this to use in combo with my Mitsubishi HC1500 DLP Projector and it works well (you can buy them as a combo at Amazon, though i bought my projector separately). As others have noted, sometimes retracting it can take a couple of tries, but it will roll up into the housing. The picture thrown on it is very good, particularly the Blu-Ray hi-def image from a PlayStation that we tried it with. I mounted the screen using heavy-duty shelf brackets (to bring it off the wall, in front of the backmasking) and it works really well. I used S-hooks thru the metal clips though there are screw/bolt holes as well in the housing. A quality item at a terrific price (all in, i think this ran me around $90 including shipping)."
1,very bad,"It showed my order is delivered, but I have never got it. I have to contact the provider twice and eventually cancelled the order. very bad experience."
5,The best for this price.,"First time I bought manual screen that u have to pull down with your hand, but after few days using it I realized that it is better to add $80 more and purchase an electric screen. This screen provides me with a pretty good quality, I have Mitsubishi HC1500 projector. I hardly suggest to buy an electric screen since it's so much easier to use!"
1,Completely died in 8 months,"I got this as a Christmas 2006 present. I probably watched 1-3 DVDs a week. It is now August 2007 and it won't read any disks I put in it. I have to buy a new DVD player. With all the bad reviews I see, I say, ""Do not buy this!"""
2,Trying this player for 2nd time.,"Bought my first unit in April, 2006. It started freezing up intermittently on playback. It also would not reject at times.Returned it to Toshiba and they sent a new unit in December, 2006. They were quick to send me a replacement (3 weeks). The new unit was manufactured in October, 2006. Time will tell if this unit pukes like my first one.Well, I received the replacement unit from Toshiba and, Yes, you guessed it, they sent me another faulty unit. It freezes at will just like the first one I bought.Toshiba is not going to achieve brand loyalty if they continue to engineer and produce junk like the 4990. Also, I've been told that they have other models that are lemons as well. I'm not going to worry about any other lemons that they may be foisting on the public, however, because they treated me shabbily when I complained, so I'll buy elsewhere..................."
1,Very bad DivX,"I am returning it after trying for several hours. Sometimes it plays DivX file, 10 min later it refuses to play the very same file and requires to cool down. I contacted Toshiba and they told me: DivX compatibility is guaranteed only for CDRs, and ONLY 650M (indeed, it is written in the manual). I did not try to burn 650M CDs to check that statement - my files are usually 700M, and in any case I need DVDs.Even when I was able to play some files, twice 20 min later player was frozen (and I found a lot of complains about it online)."
1,Not a happy customer,"The box came as fast as represented in the advertisement, but after using it for about 4 DVD movies, it would no longer play. I contacted the service department of Toshiba and was informed it had to be returned at my expense for replacement. They were were very explicit on how well the unit had to be packaged for return but 15 days later the replacement arrived in a store display box. The new unit is working fine but I gave a low review because of the poor service."
1,Freezes a lot on all DVDs,"This DVD player has buggy firmware. It freezes multiple times on mostly all DVDs. I thought the unit I received was defective, so I sent in to Toshiba for replacement. The new machine they sent me has the same issues. The only work around is to reset the box by unplugging it for 5+ minutes, which temporarily resolves the freezes. So far Toshiba has not released a firmware update to fix the problems.Overall, this player has great features for the money, but the freezes make me want to throw it out the window!"
1,Very disappointing,"The first unit I purchased did nothing - no picture no sound. It took nearly a month to get it replaced (local dealer). The second unit works - sort of. It will not play any DVD-R disks, reporting them as bad, even when they play fine on my 4 year old Pioneer unit. Even commercial disks show frequent dropouts and freeze occasionally. The upconversion to 720p or 1080i displays widescreen even if the original is full frame, causing a lot of distortion."
4,Stunning colors and pattern,"This framed poster looks very nice in person and the colors are quite vibrant. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it comes with about a 2 inch white border around the entire picture.....which, in my opinion, sorta cheapens it. Nevertheless, it looks good in the living room."
3,mercedes,The sandals look nice and sexy but the problem with them that just after a couple of days the upper ankle strap with its zipper went out of sole due to not good quality of glueing. The next shoes seems to go the same way.
4,impressive but not perfect,"I have used the Delphi 6 for several weeks. All the functions but HR perform well and gradient, climbing, speed and cadence are accurate.The heart training zone information is really useful.The heart transitter is sometimes not recognised. To get it going again, I have to go through the pairing routine and sometimes reset and re-pair. This is a pain as the wheel circumference etc has to be re-entered. RB"
4,Blackburn Delphi 6.0 Bicycle Cyclometer,The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate.
5,Fun!,"This cute Christmas CD is so fun to listen to, a real joy, I'm so pleased with my purchase I definitely made a good decision when I decided to buy it. Highly recommended!"
3,"Christmas day is in our grasp, as long as we have hands to clasp.","This is a very short(24 minutes) collection of ""memorable Christmas songs from film and television"". A lot of the songs are from classic TV specials likeA Charlie Brown Christmas,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,Rudolph the Red-Nosed ReindeerandFrosty the Snowman. Great stuff, but I have to wonder why they included an awful song from the forgettable special Casper's First Christmas. But the highlight of the CD to me is ""Riu Chiu"" from The Monkees Christmas episode. This CD is too short, but at least it's really cheap!"
1,THIS IS NOT FIVE ITEMS!,"No matter what the PICTURE or the DESCRIPTION show, this is ONLY the pocket item. discountofficesupplies.com has the same FALSE ADVERTISTING.You have been warned"
5,"Not for ""virgins"" . . .","If you don't already know the songs forward and backward, you may find this CD disappointing or frustrating, unless you enjoy a minor challenge. Use the RHPS soundtrack for training, and then test your chops with 'Sing It!' The original music cues are all there, and even some backing vocals, so it's also great for RHPS troupes. If you need lyrics on a screen or just want to goof off with your friends, find a nice karaoke set of standards and don't go near any strange castles at night."
2,Rocky Horror Picture Show: Sing it!,This was advertised (tagged) as Karaoke. It is not! I was very disappointed and will be very hesitant about purchasing anything in the future.
3,Not the most comprehensive paperback available,"This dictionary (identical to the one sold in hard covers as the ""Desk"" dictionary of Spanish) is excellent within its limits. If compactness and simplicity of layout are your most important criteria (and you don't want a ""baby"" dictionary), then this may be the right choice for you.But if you want the most extensive coverage available in paperback, the Webster's New World Spanish Dictionary (ISBN 0139536477) has MANY more words and definitions, while still remaining compact enough in comparison to the big hardcovers. As someone who used the Oxford Pocket until I outgrew it and then moved on to the Webster's New World & have been delighted with its superiority, I can make this recommendation w/o reservation."
5,IT'S A LITTLE BIGGER BUT WORTH CARRYING AROUND,THIS IS A GOOD ONE. MANY SMALLER POCKET DICTIONARIES ARE WORTHLESS...THIS ONE JUST ABOUT ALWAYS HAS THE WORD I AMLOOKING FOR WITH GOOD SYNONYMS AND EXPLANATIONS. IT WILL FITIN A PURSE OR BACKPACK EASILY AND IS WELL WORTH ITS WEIGHT WITHTHE INSIGHT IT PROVIDES
3,not pocket-sized,"This dictionary is not at all meant to be carried around in the streets. It is big even for me, a birder who routinely travels with heavy bird identification guides.In the middle of the dictionary there is a section on hispanic culture and another on anglo culture, which remind me of ""Lonely Planet"" guidebooks. These take more away from the efficiency of the book. When I am in, say, Uruguay, I will refer to my guidebook for that information.The words I did not find while reading a short article were: mesurado, sosiego, and cabal. Also, I only found about 50% of the Mexican slang words I could think of.The things I always wished I had in my dictionary while learning English (from French), a bilingual conversion table for those maddening units of measurements and a bilingual map of the world, were as usual absent."
3,Pocket? More like a satchel!,"I was rushing when I ordered this dictionary and didn't take the time to read the reviews - how can you put the word 'Pocket' on this monstrousity? - It's dimensions are 7 3/4"" x 5"" x 2"". Can someone contact the publisher and get the name ""Pocket"" off the front of this book?!This is not your regular Spanish/English dictionary, it's packed with a lot of features - I had to read the instructions at the beginning of the book to understand how the translations were structured. If you're heading to a Spanish-speaking country on vacation, this is NOT the dictionary to buy!"
2,"""Pocket"" dictionary? Try ""Backpack"" dictionary!","Content wise, this book is just fine - and the reviews reflect that. However, in my quest to have a POCKET dictionary with me on my mission trips into Mexico, I did not expect to receive a book that will not fit in any of my pockets. I mean come on, why call it a pocket dictionary if it isn't one?If you are looking for a small, transportable Spanish-English dictionary, then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a smaller-than-hardback at home reference dictionary, then shop no more."
2,Good only for scholars,"Although the most authoritative of the Spanish-English dictionaries, it omits the obscene words and usages. A far more useful dictionary for everyday Latin American Spanish reading and conversation isBarron's Spanish-English Pocket Bilingual Dictionary (Barron's Foreign Language Guides)."
1,Pocket...are you kidding me??,"Calling this a pocket dictionary is an absolute joke and actually should be considered false advertising. I wouldn't even carry this in my backpack (where it would fit, but would be heavy). Ugh. Now just a few days from Christmas I will have to return this item and reorder a true pocket dictionary. Oxford does have an actual pocket-size dictionary that is apparently called the ""mini-dictionary."" So very frustrating..."
1,Not pocket size at all!,"Honestly my only gripe is that there is no way I could fit this in my pocket. I ordered 2 pocket dictionaries for an upcoming trip to Mexico and expected to use them as such. This is not even close to pocket size. In fact, I don't think I could fit it in my purse which isn't small. A more appropriate description of this dictionary would be ""junior size."" Don't buy it thinking it'll fit in your pocket!"
4,Solid & Practical - but not pocket sized,"This very practical dictionary contains over 90,000 words, Spanish verb tables, a glossary, and a section on pronunciation. The dictionary also provides common abbreviations, a guide to the world's Spanish-speaking nations, and examples of letters, resumes, emails and postcards. Additionally, the book is of nearly equal value for Spanish speakers (ya esta buena tambien para los latinos) as it contains an English dictionary and most of the afore-mentioned additional sections in Spanish. Having traveled and lived in Latin America, I could easily recommend this dictionary for students, educators, business people, and others planning extended stays.This is a nicely practical dictionary, but at 8 X 5 inches (length/width) and two inches thick, it's hardly a pocket guide. For a true pocket dictionary in addition to (or in lieu of) this one, consider Random House Webster's Pocket Dictionary."
3,Definitely NOT for a pocket!,"Although this is definitely a Spanish/English dictionary and seems very comprehensive, the word ""Pocket"" in the title is very much a misnomer. It is desk or shelf size and wouldn't fit in a pocket unless you were a kangaroo! I think the titles of this series need to change."
3,"Great Dictionary, Not Pocket Sized!","This Pocket Oxford Spanish Dictionary is a brick! I was looking for a good dictionary to take with me on a trip to Nicaragua this summer. I wanted a small dictionary I could keep in a pocket or a fanny pack. This dictionary would pull my pants off or make my fanny pack uncomfortable to wear. It would be a great dictionary to use for a Spanish class, but it is definitely not a light travel dictionary. The cover is paper too. It would get destroyed on a trip. I have seen some dictionaries that have a plastic cover that would be great for traveling."
4,"Not a ""pocket"" dictionary","This is an incredible resource for anyone working between the Spanish and English languages (very thorough even compared to the Webster's New World Spanish Dictionary); however, it is NOT a pocket dictionary as titled. The dimensions did not sound that big to me when I read them online because I overlooked the 2 inch thickness and weight. Unless you're wearing Jencos, forget it!"
3,falling apart,I have used this dictionary several hours a week for a few months. I have no problem with the content but there are too many pages in this paperback for the kind of binding it has. The most used pages are now falling out and I expect it to get worse with continued use.
4,Excellent instructional video!,"This is an outstanding video for teaching about the history of ethnic studies! I use it every year, and my students are able to make an intellectual and emotional connection with the course."
2,FASCINATING DREAMWORLD,"THIS BOOK IS OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY SOMEONE, WHO ONLY CASUALLY KNEW TALLULAH BANKHEAD, AND NEEDED TO MAKE SOME MONEY BY WRITING THIS MOSTLY FALSE ACCOUNT OF HER LIFE. SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF TRUTHFULNESS TO THEM, BUT MOST PROBABLY MADE UP BY THE AUTHOR TO MAKE THE STORY MORE INTERESTING. IT BECOMES OBVIOUS DURING THE READING OF THE BOOK, THAT THE AUTHOR IS MORE INTENT ON CONVINCING THE READER OF HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH TALLULAH BANKHEAD, WHEN IN FACT THE OPPOSITE WOULD BE THE CASE. SUCH HAS HAPPENED TO GRETA GARBO, AND MANY OTHER NOTABLE ENTERTAINERS. SAD THAT AUTHORS GET AWAY WITH THE WRITING OF BOOKS SUCH AS THIS ONE, BUT IT PROBABLY HELPS TO FATTEN THEIR POCKETBOOKS AT THE INITIAL TIME OF PUBLICATION."
3,Spanish Phrasebook,"I ]Langenscheidt' s Universal Phrasebook Spanish (Langenscheidt's Universal Phrasebook) (Spanish Edition)I think this small book have much content. It`s useful for English and Spanish people. Perhaps it fail one chapter about furniture and household.I find it`s a good book for Spanish people too. Sometimes I read the book when I have no please to see TV, and sometimes when I wait somebody or when I go to the underground. It`s good for remember words or for learn new words. It`s true that it`s better for English people but Spanish people that want to learn or remember its Knowledge of English, its good too. Overall one small and good Phrasebook."
5,Ladies: A versitle item to have in your daily planner,"Ladies, these notes are perfect for taking notes at a meeting, jotting a note to put in the mail or sending a co-worker an ""atta girl"" or a quick thank you! Hard to find, but great to have with your daily planner!"
3,meh...,"The ""camouflage"" function of this tarp is somewhat undermined by the nice, bright brass grommets around the edge that are highly reflective. Otherwise, it makes for a passable hunting blind. Not the highest quality item out there, but the price is right."
2,save your money,"Brooks and Reiner are so stilted by this performance it shows. It doesn't have the snap of the earlier recordings and in this tired recording, there's alot of cursing and swearing(infomercial and self help book)which is not in the early renditions. Save your money and learn from my mistake, don't buy this."
2,Great stories but poor sound quality,"I have been a Ruth Rendell fan for years and really enjoyed set 1. I am very disappointed by the second set because of poor sound quality and the lack of subtitles. I was looking forward to buying the third, but I think I will give it a miss."
2,Thw Ruth Rendell Mysteries - Set 2,I watched 2 stories and they were so boring. I did not watch the other stories. I will not be purchasing more Ruth Rendell Mysteries. It was a waste of money
2,Visually stunning but dull,"There's no denying that the hi-def footage here is gorgeous, but The Beauty of Snakes has some of the worst narration I have ever heard on a documentary. The robotic woman's voice is completely emotionless and entirely in monotone. She conveys no interest, no enthusiasm, no emotion at all. It sounds like she is utterly bored with what she is saying. As a result, the viewer also feels weighed down by boredom. It is hard to stay interested in this doco because of this."
2,No Intrinsic Quality,"This is ridiculous, the narrator didn't mention anything worthwhile, the quality - although stunning...doesn't make up for the lack of information present here. This is a documentary for 10 year olds."
5,GREAT blade!,"I am a GC so I'm always on the look-out for great deals of stuff we use/consume a lot. This 40T blade is a great value and is a winner, no regrets!"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I got this book because I read the reviews online. I purchased the book at about 5pm on Saturday and finished reading it by 5 pm on Sunday. It was a quick read, but the characters lacked depth. I was very disappointed that two-thirds of the book focused on childhood puppy-love while only the last third focused on adult relationships. The ending was HORRIBLE."
3,Poorly developed main character,"I read the book. The whole book. I think Alex was trying to show that not all stories end happily ever after. But at the same time, I think its important to show the lesson learned in the story. This book basically starts off with a man who admits he can't commit to a monogamous relationship. It goes into his life about how he really learned about sex in a less than nurturing kind of way. It ends up with him having fantasys about his friend's wife. (I won't go into the ending out of respect for the writer), but I thought it ended in a way that made me say -- this person has not developed from the way he was first introduced.The side characters or his string of women, were more dynamic than the main character.Alex is right though, some people don't ever change their habits, ways, etc. But if I wanted that much reality, I would have bought a biography.Great cover though.Jesse"
2,Not A Good Read,The main character was portrayed as a teen sex addict. Not sure where the author was going with this - but I hope this is not the typical actions of most teenage males. This was more of a biography - not what I expected. Better luck next time.
3,Chap 16 page 211........,"That is as far as I could get. You know the saying....""Don't judge a book by it's cover.""? Take that advise!!! I am this far in the book and nothing that caught my attention from the books excerpt has happened yet. This book is well written, but I was totally expecting something else. This is a great book for 21 and under. Or if you want to reflect in your high school days. Even then, not every girl I met in high school feel in love with me.(...) I am just disappointed of the turn out. I am not a quiter, so I am just putting it aside and hopefully I will get the urge to finish it by the end of summer."
4,Emotional High,"This book captures the essesence of sex and love, and all the emotion that goes with it. I couldn't put the book down. When I finished reading, I was feigning for more. This was an easy read where the author exposes you to feelings of infatuation, lust, turmoil, the loss of true loss, and complete happiness. Alex Hairston has me hooked."
3,UMMM.....OK,"This book was just OK. Something to waste time with, to me this book seemed very unrealistic. Eric falls in love with every girl he meets and this is starting at the age of 16. Every girl that meets him is head over heels no matter if he is 17 and she is like 21. He seems to pump his self up throughout the whole book and there is confusing moments when you don't know if it is present time or the past. The book could use more structure, and some more realism."
3,Interesting...,"This is an interesting coming of age story about a young man's sexual awakening throughout his high school and college years. However, the preview on the back of the book leads the reader to believe that the story will be about the lead character's current life and loves as an adult, when in fact only about 10% of the book actually deals with that. Since this is an Advance Uncorrected Proof, perhaps the preview can be changed to reflect what the majority of the book is about. The story is good but would be more enjoyable if the readers expectations were set for what the book is actually about.Reviewer: ES"
5,I loved this book!,"I loved this book from beginning to the end! Alex Hairston did a great job. I laughed, I cried, and laughed some more. I loved Eric's character. When you read it, you'll see why the women loved him too. The poetry in this book blows you away. Just an overall great book to read! I truly enjoyed it and definitely recommend it. Thanks Alex Hairston, I look forward to reading future work from you! Excellent Job!"
5,A great book,Love Don't Come Easy is one the best books that I have read to date. It takes you on an emotional roller coaster. I laughed and cried. Alex Hairston is certainly an up and coming star. One to watch out for. I can't wait for his next book.
3,Interesting!,"WEll Eric Brown Jr lived QUITE a life...before he was even out of high school. This is one of those books that you KNOW you shouldn't read, but you can't stop! He was kind of all over the place, but it kept my attention."
4,Pretty good book if you have an open imagination!,"Personally I thought the book was well written and very exotic. I do have to agree with some of the reviews not liking the fact that he did fall in love with all the women he encountered. I guess I was hooked on the book because it was nearly reality for me in my younger days. Well without the rich parents and falling in love everytime! :) This book takes you on a journey from a young 16 year old sexually excited male to a successful publisher/nurse in his early 30's longing for that ultimate love. I say give it a try, I know I enjoyed it!"
1,Pretty lame,Not great did not seem to have enough force to kill a big moth. I would recommend try a different product.
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this item. With an active family that loves to spend time outdoors, our backdoor becomes a revolving door in the warm weather days. This seems to invite flies in by the multitude. We have worn out several fly swatters, and i was excited to get this for me and my husband to have a little fun taking out some flies. So far, the flies are mocking us. its hard to score a direct hit with fast flying, but even once you do, they only bounce off of it and keep going. we have not struck one yet, mid air or landed that has died."
5,Bug Gun,Shoots good killed lots of Bugs FUN very accurate it was a great gift for my surrogate grandson he played with mine when ever he came over so i figured he would have lots of fun with one of his own
3,So So,Unless you hit the fly dead center it doesn't hurt the fly. I shouldn't have to shoot the fly 5 times before it dies.
1,Arrived Broken,"Product was made of flimsy plastic and arrived in many pieces. We never got to use it. Since no return information was included, we had no way to send it back or request a replacement."
5,Works Great!,"This nifty little fly gun is awesome. Always works and kills just about any bug. Accuracy is not bad, but the ""smasher"" is wide enough that it is hard to miss. Shooting them out of the air is better then shooting them on the wall because their insides splatter..."
3,plastic elastic,on first seeing the material its made fromand the size of the spring involved you think its goingto break...first time I tryed it just workedalthough I could'nt use for say a big bar stewardI'd just have to use my dyson animal on it
4,Surprised that it actually works,"i bought this more as a novelty to make dealing with the pesky house flies less annoying. I expected it to provide more comic relief than actual fly killing ability and I was actually quite mistaken. The spring in the launching section is actually quite strong, launching the disc powerfully enough to squish most flies easily. The problem however is with the disk. If you do not shoot the disc at a 90 degree angle to the surface the fly is on, most of the time it will not squish them and they fly off. With some practice with positioning though, it ended up being an effective tool for me that actually managed to kill quite a few flies without any misses. Considering this is only in the 5 dollar range, it isn't a huge investment and provides much more entertaining way of dealing with these pesky flies."
3,"Just ""ehh"" unless you hit dead on",Difficult to use unless you have a dead on shot that will hit the wall flat. Otherwise it bounces and the fly escapes.
1,bad intrustion,i bought the gun because of all the good review but when i open this little bag trying to put the gun together there is no instruction manual of putting the gun together so i have to figure it out myself and Broke it.. so i give it 1 star..intruction is not very clear written very dissappoint it..
1,I heard the man say it himself,"In 1969 or so I was a 17 year old Maynard fan in a small Kentucky town. Listening to late night air waves, I picked up an honest to God live interview with Maynard. Rodchester NY..a guy named Harry Abraham asked Maynard about this ""album"". I still remember his words "" I must have been high on something to have let that album be released like that"". That says it all. Nice cover!"
5,Higher is Better,Great album. I wish I had added this one to my collection sooner. This is pure Maynard.
1,A Disaster in CD Form,"I love Maynard, but this album makes no sense. The arrangements are terrible. The all-star band sounds awful. Maynard barely plays, and with none of his usual energy and drive. You'd think he was trying to get out of a recording contract! Even for Maynard collectors, this one should stay out of the collection. (Or buy it and then never open it.) I can't recommend Maynard's playing enough, but this album won't shed light on Maynard's genius."
3,What happened to Utah?,"The author covers interesting places in most of the Western states, with the noteable exception of Utah. After spending the past 2 weeks in Utah, exploring caves, petroglyphs, and cliff dwellings of the Anazazi and Fremont Indians, I referred to the book to see if any of the places I visited were mentioned. I was surprised to see that the entire state of Utah was ignored."
4,Isn't it time you learned Flash?...,...That's what I kept asking myself when I noticed most web companies I talked to and web jobs ads I read were inquiring about my ability to create Flash animations. In order to stay on top of Web technologies I went looking for books about Flash.I recently bought two Flash animation books to help me learn. Flash! Creative Web Animation is the one I kept.
3,Sparse reading devoted to Flash animation,"Although the book show the basics very well, as I mastered all the steps, I sought for more advanced steps. That's where the book ended. No advanced stuff, no detailed descriptions of various uses. Only very basic drawing and animation, nothing like what you see out on the web. I'd like to see more stuff on Flash."
2,Poor exercises and explanations.,"The basics were explained well but about half way through the book, Mr. Plant got very lazy. Some exercises weren't clear and the examples on the CD were a joke. If you like learning programs by book, you really don't have many other options than this book. Maybe try the lessons that come w/ Flash."
2,more exercise,"I think that it has great explanation however, it doesn't provide to many programming details or examples. Besides that I think is great."
2,Definitely for beginning web developers,"As a veteran web developer, I found the book strong in explaining how to use the fundamental tools of flash, (the pen, ink bottle, lasso, etc.) However, the book didn't give much attention to building a flash site with multiple links to multiple flash movies and creating complex button behaviors. I eventually got what I needed, but it wasn't from this book - it was from another Flash developer."
4,"A concise, in-depth look at the king of the web, Flash 3.","It does not take long to understand why masters of Flash 3 are so sought after in the web site industry. Darrel Plant introduces the Flash 3 platform in a way that will have Illustrator users begging for copies. Although I am not much of a designer or artist, I was able to pick up on nearly everything that was explained without having to re-read passages (which seems to be quite commonplace for me with other books). My Director background did help, but this book will teach anyone willing to learn the fundamentals the essentials and advanced techniques of Flash 3."
4,"So far, so much better!","This is the 6th coffee maker I've owned in three years, falling in the middle of the purchase price range. It has finally brought peace to my household, since I no longer spend the first five minutes of the morning wiping coffee puddles off the counter. I also appreciate the fact that Cuisinart included a gold filter with the unit. Furthermore, unlike my previous two coffee makers, this one's 3-beep completion alarm is not overly loud or obnoxious. This model's biggest drawbacks, for me, are the difficulty reading the internal water level gauge, and the fact that the lid can be tricky to reattach. I can live with those inconveniences, though, if the coffee maker continues to function properly and doesn't start leaking."
1,AVOID TRAGEDY,At this time of giving PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I have sent my pot with the US safety commission and it has started on fire. 2 different pots. I was replaced with the first one and hesitated to try again and foolish I was. Both pots had the same symptoms and started smoking sizzling ect... Lucky I was home both times and able to catch it in time.I know it seems sturdy and nice and it has big 14 cup capibilites just turn away. Buy a different model cuisinart if you must just NOT the DCC-2200. Happy Holidays.
2,14 Cup Coffeemaker,I loved the large capacity of this coffee maker. It worked beautifully and was easy to program. Its life expectancy was very disappointing. It was stopped working in less than a year. I expected better quality from Cuisinart.
5,Best Cuisinart Coffeemaker I have owned!,"This coffeemake looks great, brews more cups than my old ones, and coffee even tastes better! Buy it, you'll love it."
2,terrible customer service,"First, this is an excellent coffee maker, best we've ever had. Makes super hot great tasting coffee every time and keeps it hot for as long as you want. We've had the machine for just over a year and the filter basket broke where there's a spring that allows you to take out the pot during brewing (a feature we never use). I tried to order a replacement, but they don't offer it from Cuisinart and when I tried to contact them I get absolutely no response. As much as I like the machine, I will never purchase from Cuisinart again."
1,Average Coffee Capacity,"I bought the 14-cup assuming it would have the capacity to handle more coffee beans ground (I like strong coffee). But no. It takes a typical 12-cup #4 cone filter, and there's no room for spillover. The filter holder is the same size as the filter. My previous $30 Mr. Coffee machine at least has room for filling the filter up to the brim. You can't do that with this machine. Moreover, this design flaw defeats the manufacturer's selling proposition that a 14-cup capacity is suited for entertaining. Well, if you do that, those cups of coffee are probably weak."
2,Great if you like lukewarm coffee,I have used this coffeemaker now for three months and I've tried varying amounts of coffee and tried many settings to make a satisfying brew. Happy to say that this coffeemaker is performing well to produce lukewarm coffee. Certainly not hot coffee. The metal carafe does well to keep the cofee lukewarm for several hours. I just wish it would make the coffee hotter. It would also probably improve the taste.
1,Great until it burned up,"I LOVED my new coffee maker. It does drip a bit when the carafe is removed during the brewing, but not a big deal. Today, though, at 10 months old, it caught on fire! Thankfully, my husband and I were sitting right there, at the table, enjoying a cup of coffee and heard an unfamiliar noise. The leftover coffee was boiling, the machine was OFF, and when the machine was tipped back, I could see FLAMES inside! Took it outside and used the hose on it, so no harm done, but what IF! We are replacing it with an exact model but have learned to UNPLUG small appliances if we're not going to be home!UPDATE...Replaced with same model and guess what happened a year later? YEP, caught on fire AGAIN. Obviously, I'm not so stupid as to replace it with another Cuisinart."
4,Bigger IS better!,"I am hard to please when it comes to coffeemakers and have tried just about all major brands. I am very happy with this particular one because of the larger capacity. I have a vacation home on the coast and enjoy entertaining friends and family and everyone loves a good cup of coffee. This is the Northwest, home of heavy-duty coffee drinkers! The 14-cup size is great, the controls are easy to use and it makes a very acceptable cup of coffee, nice and hot. The only thing I would change would be an external water indicator so it would be easier to see exactly how much water you are adding rather than having to look inside the reservoir. If you want to make a lot of coffee, this is the one for you!"
5,Cuisinart DCC-220 Coffeemaker,"I receive the coffeepot quickly and well packaged. However, the instruction booklet was missing. Had to contact the manufacturer to get one, which was delivered in about 4 days. Had no problem getting the booklet. I'm pleased with the product and the quick response."
2,Almost caught fire,Sorry to be negative but thought people should know... we loved our Cuisinart coffee maker but this morning it shorted out and almost caught fire after the coffee was through making. We are so thankful we were home.
1,Water dumps everywhere!!! Ugh!!!,"We received this coffee maker as a wedding gift to match our stainless steel kitchen look. It was $140 on sale. Well, our previous coffee maker (Krups) was going on it's 10th straight year with no problems, so I waited until it finally died to open my ""new in the box"" Cuisinart coffee maker.From the very first day it dumped water from the condensation above the coffee filter and water reservoir all over the counter top. It isn't a trickle, it's a pool of water.I called Cuisinart about it and they said they couldn't do anything about it since the 3 year warranty had expired. I explained it was a wedding gift I had just opened and it was clearly a design flaw. Didn't matter to them! They were not willing to do anything about it. Terrible customer service.I'm waiting for it to catch on fire like so many others have. Maybe they'll do something then."
4,DCC-2200,"The only thing I do not like about this coffee maker is that it does not have an external sight glass to indicate how much water is in the reservior, every thing else great. Unlike my old pot it dosen't wake me before tha alarm does."
2,coffeemaker,The coffee is extremely hot from this coffeemaker. Beware! I find the product adequate but not outstanding. It is difficult to insert the pot all the way in after use.
2,Designed by a non-coffee drinker,Problems: Reservoir water level not visible from exterior. I have a little flashlight beside it so I am able to see down inside to read how many cups of water I've poured in. The lid is a hassle to snap back on. I don't bother anymore. The only good thing is that the coffee is very hot.
4,CUSINART FEATURES LESS THAN OLDER MODELS,"WE HAVE OWNED THE 12 CUP MAKER AND WE REALLY NEEDED THE 14 CUP FEATURE SO BOUGHT THIS MODEL.WE HAVE ONLY OWNED CUISNART BRAND COFFEE MAKERS FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS. ON THIS MODEL WE WERE DISAPOINTED1.WE MISS THE CONTROL OF TEMPATURE PLATE FEATURE TO KEEP YOUR COFFEE ON LOW,MED OR HOT. 2. ALSO WE NOTICED THAT GROUNDS SPLASH UP ONTO TO INSIDE TOP COVER AND PLUGS THE HOLES WHERE THE WATER SPRAYS OUT FOR BREWING THE COFFEE AND WE HAVE THE CLEAN THEM OUT. BUT OVER ALL WE LOVE CUSINART."
1,"Like everyone else, mine caught on fire...","This is the third Cuisinart we've had in four years. We loved the first two, but they broke quickly (right after warranty expired, of course). So we bought this model recommended by a family member. It has worked well for 6-8 months and just the other morning performed just as the other reviewers have said. Started making a funny noise and then smoking terribly! My husband unplugged it and took it outside, but if we had not been close by (as we usually are not at that time of the morning), I feel sure we would have had a serious fire to deal with. I have reported this to Cuisinart, but so far, no reply. Do not buy this product!"
2,I don't recomend the book,"I read all of Harry Potter's book, they were great. But I don't like this book because is a little bit stupid. I really didin't understand the problem of Belladoma and the boy. The book was very very out of real world. And the end was stupid."
2,COMPARED TO HARRY POTTER.......,"A cute story, but let's face it. Released in 1979, you shouldn't expect anything very original or refreshing. A writer of today could do a lot more with the wizard world. Look at Harry Potter....."
5,"Filled with witches and wizards, magic and fun!","Arriman the Aweful, is a wizard famous for both his power and his good looks. And now that he has decided to marry, there is a long list of candidates! Belladonna, a distressingly good witch is determined to win the competition, but how can she be evil enough to win?This is a very good book for the young reader - filled with witches and wizards, magic and fun! It's a great book that is sure to please.(Review of Which Witch? by Eva Ibbotson)"
5,Belladonna's,"Have you ever wanted something so bad but couldn't have it because you weren't fit for the job? Belladonna was a white witch, but longed for Arriman the Awful, Wizard of the North, like no one could believe. What disappointed her even more was that Arriman was holding a competition for the blackest witch of Todcaster, to become his new wife.Arriman had been searching year after year for a black wizard to take over his evil ways, but could not find one. He created Wizard-Watcher, who is a three-headed creature that watches for the new wizard's cometh. After long searching day and night, there was no sign of the new wizard, so Arriman's assistant, Mr. Leadbetter, set up a competition with the help of Lester, an ogre. Can Belladonna strive for excellence in becoming a black witch with just short notice? Or will that strive turn into failure?"
3,Which Witch is not the Question,This is a cute but pat and predictable book about wizards and witches. I found the story to be void of creativity. The outcome of the story was completely predicatable about one quarter of the way through the book. There were no new surprises after that as the story played out exactly as expected.
5,"Magical, Fun, and in a way, Indescribable!!","Which Witch was one of the books I read to make up for my school's reading program; I needed books that I could enjoy and know the plot by heart. And this book, I proudly say, did not let me down. Because some people had rented it out of the library I had to wait for a week to get it, and when I did, I could understand why.This book is about a dark wizard looking for a bride; a fowl, bad, witch, that is. So he holds a contest, and one of the contestants is that one wicth who just cannot perform the dark arts. After all that drama and others, she wins with help of her newly made orphan friend, whom I apologize for not being able to remember the name of.As soon as a kid picks up this book, he or she will find it extremely hard, or even impossible, to put it down. Eva Ibbotson is NOT a harry potter wannabe; she wrote this before harry potter.I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, and I must add this:This book deserves a hundred stars."
2,I wonder how this novel will end? (sarcasm),"Yes, that's right, it's the most predictable book I have ever read, which covers an immense spectrum of literature. I, being a member of a book group, had to digress from my normal readings of the Dune series and etc. to read this. I will hand it to it Ibbotson for the mild entertainment, but the story has no unexpected twists. For those of you in suspense at how the novel is going to end, I hope you graduate from this 5th grade reading level soon."
3,Great but HIGHLY overpriced,"Great product but for the amount of ""wallpaper"" you get, the price is a litte steep. It's simple to apply and luckily it's easy to remove when the stickers get stuck together (I have the 16 ft. strips) because at that price there's no room for errors that can't be fixed. Once I started I couldn't stop! You can go crazy with your imagination and create almost any pattern (if you have the time). And since I live ina dorm, the fact that it peels right off is a plus! I'm not sure if it does damage to drywall, so if you're in that situation you might want to check it out before you spend the cash."
5,Unique view of Bhutan,"""The Blessings of Bhutan"" describes a unique view of the people, religion and culture of Bhutan. It is based on first hand experiences of Russ and Blyth Carpenter over several years of exploration, living and philanthropic work there. They have become deeply involved in the lives of these wonderful people and have been rewarded with a bird's eye view including some rather un-Western but honest approaches to life. I highly recommend this book which can be read all at once or random chapters of interest."
5,Insights on Asia's most intriguing destination,"An insightful look at one of the most intriguing destinations in all of Asia. ""Blessings"" offers a combination of thoughtful commentary, humorous cultural reflections and striking photos. The most interesting book on Bhutan I've found."
5,Best Christmas book ever,"Has good versions of the gems, plus some very-nice little-known songs. I use this one A LOT, every Christmas."
4,Go Gators!,Towels are a little thinner than expected but the color is good. I gave them to my parents for Christmas. I will follow up if they fall apart in the wash!
3,Mental illness or systems of blood problem?,"If this book better ruled out signs of other medical problems first then I would like it better. Yes the book is ok if you really have a mental illness and not low vitamin B12 or low T, etc., which cause similar symptoms.Unfortunately in the real world I read this book and others like it when doctors convinced me that I had Bipolar Disorder. Years later I finally had blood tests that showed B12 and testosterone levels 1/3 below the normal minimum. Doctors prescribed supplements and I am now basically cured of what now appears to have been a false mental illness diagnosis. Or at least symptoms of these other medical problems were missed because they were similar to the symptoms of Bipolar Disorder and other mental illness.So if the book was revised to better stress blood work and tests for other medical causes then I would rate it better. A false diagnosis is costly when your real condition gets worse so it is best to rule out other causes at the start."
1,50 signs of mental illness review:,"As a fellow psychiatrist, I found this book to be an embarassment to the field of psychiatry. Hicks writes this book as if he is writing to the mentally retarded who do not have a clue about anything. Although people who suffer from mental illness and their family and friends may not understand the medical terminology used by psychiatrists/physicians when talking about psychiatric illnesses, I found this book to be extremely condescending to the point of being ridiculous. His narcissistic manner of writing this book is offensive. I found this book to be disappointing and I would not recommend this book to anyone as it is clearly a waste of money as well a waste of time to read."
1,"Still Waiting,,,,,,,,,,",I am still waiting for the delivery of this book. I hopeI will receive a copy before May 2007
2,Not the same old Hallows eve,"I just recently purchased this CD, and I was very disapointed. If anyone buys this thinking it will sound anything like Hallows Eve's original 3 Albums will not be happy. Only Tommy Stewart is left(who does most of the vocals)and the rest of the band I never heard of. The other vocals are by some guy named skullto or something,which just sounds like bad death metal. The production is not too good either.I don't like to slam bands that try to make a comeback,but this is not it. Pass on this."
1,Contender for worst thrash album ever made.,"Along with albums like Mortal sin- every dog has its day this is one of the worst ""thrash"" albums ever. Get hallows eves first 3 cds but avoid this one."
1,Better skip this one!,"I've loved Hallow's Eve ever since college, and liked how Stacy Anderson's voice works with the hooky metal licks. I was very excited to find this new album released, as I had never expected to see a new Hallow's Eve album. Alas, I purchased it and gave it a listen... it's downright horrible. Tommy Stuart has taken over the vocals, Stacy Anderson is gone. The hooky songwriting/riffwriting is also gone. There are 2, maybe 3, decent songs, but nothing like the quality of their old stuff. And even these 2 or 3 songs still sound like they were recorded through a pair of tin cans and some string. The album production sucks, the songs are lame, and it's just an overall disappointment. Avoid this CD at all costs!!!"
2,Flagrantly bad color rendition,"This will be the first and last Abbeville Press book I buy. Most of the plates are so far off in saturation, hue, lightness values they are laughable. Where reproductions of the same Hassam paintings appear in other books , such as American Impressionists (0823002128) or California Impressionists (0915977257), they are inviting and credible; here they are repugnant. I don't think I have ever seen plates so far off norm. I see that I have the first printing too, so it cannot be due to long run deviations. The sound you just heard was this clunker hitting the trash can."
4,Great! however........,Really wonderful and authentic tasting Upma.......one complaint however- i wish they would not use trans-fat hydrogenated oils. They should use coconut oils or regular oils. It would be MUCH healthier
5,Excellent ..simple to make and tastes like mom's,"Simply saute diced onion and diced potato with a little bit of oil, Thai chili and salt to taste. Add 500 ml water and follow instructions. Eat with pickle. It is done in 10 mins. You can add frozen vegetables etc as per taste."
5,Fascinating details create the life and times of 1855 France,"This book kept surprising me, ultimately being very satisfying. When I ordered it, it was a bit intimidating. I feared a mass of impenetrable details. Most of the book in fact is appendices.The 200 or so pages of narrative contains nice insights into 19th c French life, but also shows wine lovers a very different era, when, for instance, the shippers were more important than the wineries.The book has one interesting fact after another. Did you know that the 1855 was NOT official? That there were a zillion similar ones? That the whole purpose was to set a price structure in the 18th century?A great read for the wine lover who is into every last detail."
3,great book but no CD,"The product description is confusing, this book doesn't come with CD, the one does has different ISBN 0713-66044-9"
1,"Poorly Organized, Major Dissapointment","As a begining WebObjects developer, I was looking forward to reading this book. After receiving it, I was very disappointed. The book focuses on using Eclipse and neglects the use of XCode.The information included in the text of the book seems to focus more on the esoteric and obscure aspects of the WebObjects architecture than on use of the tool. To use as an introduction for someone who was going to maintain the WebObjects application, it may be fine, but for someone learning the tool and using it to develop dynamic sites, the value is limited.It seems that there was more effort put into making cute chaper titles than on the content of the book. The cute titles are not really amusing to me, not because they are not cute, but because in most cases, they do not convey the contents of the chapters. When I buy a technical book, I use it to learn and have available as a reference. This book is busy gathering dust."
5,Fantastic film!,"There's no wonder this was chosen to follow the 2010 Heisman presentation and is considered the ""winner"" of all 30 on 30 ESPN films. SMU's Thad Mattula does an honest, accurate portrait of the high days and death penalty of his alma mater. I highly recommend this to any sports enthusiast."
4,good news/bad news,"I thought the show was great and it was story boarded with great detail, however the quality of the dvd disc is frustrating. It pauses frequently, then when it starts again, it has skipped over 5-10 seconds of the program. I haven't counted how many times, but if I were guessing, I would say between 15-20 times. I'm sure every disc is not like this, but it would be nice to have one that doesn't."
3,Echo Chamber vocals spoil somewhat,This 3rd LP by Carlos Lyra is spoiled by the echo chamber vocals - Bossa Nova and Carlos Lyra are much better and enjoyable - still some good songs and performances here
1,Don't get this album if you have the full Hampsterdance album.,"I don't have this album, and I'm not getting it because it's just the first 8 tracks of ""Hampsterdance The Album"", but I like that album, so if you don't have it, you could get one or the other."
3,Bit of a disappointment,"When I listen to many other groups playing this style of music, one of the beauties is that all the musicians seem to be playing their own music, but it usually all blends into a fine rollicking collection. On this album, they all play the same tune. There seems to be little of the intricacies Terry Woods has demonstrated on the Pogues, the first Woods Band album or many of the other derivatives of Sweeney's Men or Planxty. I also find the vocals fairly bland, nice but very forgetable. All-in-all a pleasant electric Irish trad album, but on othere CDs of this genre, you don't use words like nice and pleasant.Having said this, the album starts to redeem itself towards the end. Terry's musicianship begins to weave some of its potential magic and the vocal come on stronger. Terry takes lead vocals on track 9 and shows what the album could have been."
5,Purchased as a Gift - Magnificent M*A*S*H,I purchase this and other Magnificent M*A*S*H CD sets as gifts for another MASH fan. We enjoying revisiting this great show.
3,'New' Collector's Edition DVD are all scratch-up,Not awful but definately not perfect. The dvd's play but I don't like that instead of going to the table of contents so I can select which episode I'd like to watch each dvd automatically launches into the 1st episode. All 8 of my other M*A*S*H dvd sets allow you to first select which episode you would like to watch. There were a couple of scratches but then again the dvd's do play I just don't think it was worth the 'new' price. The vendor in TX should check with who he received these dvd's from.
4,As expected,The jacket looked kinda melted. The plastic on the outside looked shrunk.DVDs are in good shape and played well.
3,Charles Emerson Winchester was created by the writers people,He often had the best lines in every ep not because actor Ogden Stiers could actually think upall these great lines but because the writers doted on the character something fierce. Do not give Stiers all the credit for Charles. And the eps by season nine could get dull at times. season one of the series had never been dull.
3,MASH season 9,"Some episodes still had that old M*A*S*H humor that I saw from earlier seasons,unfortunately too many episodes were too political and preachy for my taste."
4,Too much Liberal Propaganda??,"I am a great fan of the MASH series, and have been since I started watching them during rain-affected baseball games. I've bought and watched all the seasons now. But I got tired of the ultra-liberal propaganda of this show. They constantly belittle any idea that strays from their liberal thinking. But I suppose that's to be expected given the time period the show was produced in. I love the humor, but I hate the liberal propaganda!"
3,Missing Booklets-MASH,"The DVD was what I expected, but there was no bookletattached explaining what episodes were on the DVD. Iwas issued a credit, but would rather have the booklet."
5,M*A*S*H Best seasons are the 3 last!,"When Alan Alda takes over in the writing and directing of certain episodes, they turn out to be the best episodes of the particular season. They do not uplift war and they usually make you laugh one moment and want to cry the next. I love dramatic comedy. It makes us think about how lucky we are to have people who answered the call to serve us. Even when they did not want to be there! M*A*S*H is a classic show that shows us this and more!"
3,Mediocre at best.....,"Unfortunately, by season nine, the producers of MASH were really scraping the bottom of the barrell for stories. I mean, who cares about a bridge tournament? Or the fact that Charles takes karate lessons because someone punched him in the nose? And am I the only one absolutely sick and tired of watching BJ Honeycutt complain yet again about not being with his wife Peg? The stories in series 9 just aren't compelling like in the earlier series. I wonder now if I should bother buying seasons ten and eleven.Another problem is there are only twenty episodes in season 9 (unlike the standard 24). 4 episodes is two hours (the length of time for a typical movie) but there doesn't seem to be any discount on the price to take that into account."
1,FRAUD,this book is a waste of time to read (all 15 minutes that it would take) what ever you do don't bother evan cohen didn't really know gg allin HE IS A FRAUD
5,If you dont know who gg allin was read this book.,"GG Allin makes M Manson look like a school girl. The book is short to short. For all gg allin did with his life, And all the pics that should have been in there. There is a lot missing.... It will take people who never heard of GG ALLIN on a shocking ride, That seems unreal untill they see a video.. Its worth the read."
1,"Interesting subject, awful writing","Not even a subject as interesting and controversial as GG Allin could make the effort of reading this worthwhile. The writing is limp, scattered and self-serving. The author spends more time describing the symptoms of the cold he caught while on tour with the Murder Junkies than he does describing their adventures or giving us insight into the personalities of the relevant characters. Reading this is a...waste of time. Buy the book, but just look at the pictures. They'll tell you as much as the author did, and you'll save yourself two hours."
5,"Upbeat, mood setting, sexy must have CD","Sirens made me a fan. A very unique sound and feel to it. Quinn has an incredible voice. I love the era of the 40's and 50's that it conjures up. But with the recording technologies of the 90's, I've not heard anything like it. Her singing is sensuous and ""teasing"" all the way through. I thought I had a little bit of everything in my collection. Sirens is what I was missing."
1,"Wannabe Broadway Ingenue ""Swings"" And Stumbles","Yet another attractive young woman hops on the retro bandwagon, only to fall off. What do these cutesy mannerisms and affected stylings have to do with swing? She ought to be doing commercials or community theatre musicals. One of the tunes on the CD sums it up: ""Thanks But No Thanks""."
4,a fine introduction to lesser-heard material,"There is no reason to buy this disc, really, if you have MUSK AT DUSK/IMPOSSIBLE HOLIDAYS by Irmin Schmidt, DELUGE by Karoli and Estes, NOWHERE by Jaki's Phantomband, and ON THE WAY TO THE PEAK OF NORMAL by Czukay; the best tracks on the album are taken from these discs. If you DON'T know these albums -- all substantial solo works by members of one of the most interesting bands of the 1970s, then this disc will be a LOT of fun for you, and a great excuse to go out and buy at the very least the Karoli and Schmidt recordings -- after which you can sell Cannibalism III and forget about it, which is what I did, though I bought Phantomband, too, and liked it more than some folks. Czukay once again is the archival force behind the project. Strangely, the weakest moments on the disc are his -- I really HATE ""Cool in the Pool"" and would routinely program my CD player AROUND it. The ""Witches' Multiplication Table"" stuff is pretty cool, tho'."
4,let's get cool...,"Alan Macinnis of Vancouver is entitled to his opinion, but as someone who visited Inner Space Studios when Holger Czukay was mixing 'Cool in the Pool' and the rest of 'Movies' I have to say he's well off-beam about what is possibly the funniest and weirdest sonic cut-up to ever emerge from this band. And I've followed them for more than 30 years as fan and critic. Try it again, Al baby...Oh, and more generally, NEVER trust anyone who insists on using UPPER CASE WRITING..."
3,"No ""Disco Stomp"" !","How could ""The Very Best Of Bohannon"" not include ""Disco Stomp"" and the full length album version of ""Let's Start The Dance""? I only marginally recommend this CD because, like many such compilations, it suffers egregious omissions."
4,Classic Old School,Used to have this in vinyl...so happy to have it in cd format. Great album. Great pice. Fast shipping. thanks!
2,Not what you expect,"This is only good if you don't care whether it is a faceless singer or the original singer or group doing the song! Boys, this is not worth the money, when you can get the CD-singles of these hits by the orginal artists or better quality compilation CD's also released by Megahit records such as the ""Gay Happening"" series and the ""Divas of Dance"" series. Try those CD's instead. They are cheaper too. If you want the pic of the hot cover guy, print it out. So, save your cash & skip this one, boyz!"
2,Dont bother,This seemed really cool... A gettysburg doc. in HD...what could be better right??? Well jokingly i have said before that the only thing they got right with this film was the spelling of Gettysburg. I was discusted after 8 minutes of watching it. The HD was great dont get me wrong on that but the mis-facts were terrible. The film depicted the potential of taking culps hill in the middle of the day when the order was presented late at night in very dark pennsylvania. And the screwed with the names of the Generals during the first day of the battle... Overall it was terrible but I would not suggest buying it even though it is listed very cheap for blu-ray.
1,Worst Civil War Documentary Ever,"I picked this disc up a couple of months ago at Best Buy, and I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was.First and most importantly, there's more than one glaring inaccuracy. If you're going to do a documentary about Gettysburg, shouldn't you at least check the basic facts? It was frustrating, to say the least.So frustrating, in fact, that I've yet to watch the portion detailing Lincoln's post-battle visit to Gettysburg. If the battle portion was any indication, the Gettysburg Address segment was going to be as bad ... or worse.The ONLY decent feature were the battle maps. When viewed in high definition, they're fairly cool. However, a few maps here and there isn't nearly enough to warrant a purchase. Go with something else ... anything else."
2,DERP DERP DERP,"I never thought that people designing a documentary would get basic facts incorrect but these people did. There were several inaccuracies regarding the Battle of Gettysburg. Probably too many to list and most wouldn't be appreciated except by Civil War buffs. The historical actors were stilted, especially in their dialogue. Oh and they used some questionable sources arguing the American Civil War was fought because of slavery. While that was certainly a sub factor there's a bigger scope as to how this war came about and anyone uninformed who chooses to watch this documentary will be severely misled. Don't buy it. WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: D to D plus."
1,bobby darin(november21 1995-audio cd,I MUST NOT BE READING THIS PROPERLY OR THIS ITEM IS OVER PRICED FOR A SINGLE CD AT 71.99 PLEASE REPLY IF THIS A BOX SET COLLECTION AND HOW MANY CD S ARE IN THE PACK THANK YOU
5,An Extraordinary Achievement,"Bobby Darin was simply one of the most talented performers of all time. At a time in music when performers took few chances, Darin did it all. What's amazing is how he excelled in every genre he attempted.Even Sinatra, arguably the all-time greatest pop singer, often sounded foolish when attemping contemporary material. Check out Darin's folk songs, they are the real deal. Darin refused to be typecast, and in the long run it probably hurt him. If he would have stuck to the standards, he would probably be right behind Sinatra in stature. I would never fault an artist, however, for attempting to expand his, and our, horizons. The Rhino box is a tremendous testament to a vastly underrated artist."
2,Not for the grammer police,"I liked that this was a Windows Installer book. I also liked how short it was (less than 300 pages). The author has an impressive resume which is at odds with the books grammer. It was like reading something printed verbatim, and this got annoying very quickly. I'm no english major, but whoever edited this book should re-edit and try again.Run on sentences, and redundancies aside, this book provided gutsy insight into the Windows Installer world. You soon find out why there are companies that specialise in making installation software.Since theres not much to choose from, this book will probably be a top pick for many. However, I found it difficult to read, expecting somewhat better ""english""."
3,wasn't exactly what i had hoped,Didn't get much out of this book honestly. Maybe it's because i'm .net c# etc and this book seemed more geared towards the COM+/legacy side of things. It might work best for someone who wants to use windows installer in a legacy environment. I think I should have studied more WIX instead.
1,What sizes?,Blast it. There is no mention of the sixes of the hex. The drive is covered but we must know the sizes of the hexes or we can not buy it dummies!
2,Phantom mask,"I was very disappointed in this product. It arrived in a padded package. When I removed the mask, it was cracked during the shipping process, I presume. The mask itself was not worth the price paid as it is made of very flimsy plastic which is most likely why it cracked during shipping. If I had actually seen this product before the purchase, I would not have bought it. The only good thing is that it arrived fairly quickly."
1,Not even close to picture,"The description for this item says ""exact mask may vary slightly from picture"" which is a gross exaggeration. The mask they send is a much cheaper completely different mask. I have the mask that is pictured and it is of a much higher quality than the flimsy piece of junk I was sent. There was no padding or packaging in the box and two of the five ""masks"" I ordered arrived crushed. I also think the box they used for shipping is way too small - it is only one inch thick, something you might ship a book in - not items that people need to have arrive in tact. These masks sell for 2.97 but I wouldn't pay a quarter for them, that is how cheap and lousy they are. Mine are going straight back to the company - I'm just sorry I have to pay to ship this junk twice."
4,"Not an HP item, but it still does the job.","I was a bit thrown in the beginning because the item shown when purchasing is the original HP ink in the original packaging. This item does NOT come like that. It's separately boxed, and from what it looks like, it was a cartridge that was just refilled. Honestly, I don't really care. It's for my printer at home, and it does just as good of a job as the original printer cartridge that I had, for way less money. I will definately buy again."
1,expired color cartridge,I almost replaced the printer untill I discovered the supplied ink cartridge was three years past its expiration date. Replaced the cartridge with another (within expiration date) and printer worked normally
3,Poor editing,"There are great pieces of work in this book, but the editors should be ashamed of themselves! I hear that this is only true for the books printed recently, but it is ridiculous! Stories are cut off, things are literally crossed out in ink, it is crazy! I gave it a 3 because the poems, plays, etc. inside the book are excellent, but the editing makes me sure that I'll be returning this book at the end of the semester."
5,A must for any Prolog programmer,"This book is a must for anyone doing serious Prolog programming. The book itself is a standard in clarity, concision and rigor.There are minor drawbacks:1. Poor paper quality and binding. Any programmer striving to write portable Prolog programs would use it heavily and the poor qualify shows off in just a month of daily use. Unfortunately, the form is not at the same level as the content.2. The predefined predicates lack a listing by page (although they are listed by topic). This makes finding a certain particular predicate rather cumbersome when looked up frequently.3. Minor typos.Otherwise, no one serious about Prolog can afford to overlook this book."
2,dollar store quality,The pretty red pouch does its best to dress up these made-in-China necklaces. The little bulbs are haphazardly glued on. Some are crooked and look ready to fall off. Indeed one did fall of just from being taken from the package and had to be hot glued back on. The necklace is cute from a distance but I'm not sure how long it will last.
4,Merry Holidays,"I bought two sets of these pretty necklaces to give as gifts. I gave them to different women in my life ages 11-55 years old. They ALL loved them. I was given one of these necklaces last year and I get many compliments on it. The one drawback is that if worn on a bare neck, it scratches."
1,Stale,These are probably the worst chips I've ever had. They taste like pieces of cardboard soaked in a lime flavored chemical cocktail. .
4,Addictive,I loved the tangy flavor of these chips! I wasn't expecting to get 12 big bags of chips (I thought they were the small bags.. didn't pay attention to details lol).Glad they were big bags though because my whole family loved them. They went relatively fast. Great for parties!
2,DO NOT HOLD UP WELL!!!!!!,Got the boots quick to an APO address. They are very comfortable and broke in quickly. Now i know my condition's are not the best were talking on my feet 10-12hrs a day on concrete that's prob 140 degrees plus and yes had oil and who knows what else dumped on them i am and aircraft mechanic. I have been wearing them for 4mnths and blew out the seam behind the safety toe and the ribs on the bottom come off very easy. good boot just no built to last i guess..
2,Defective Zipper,"Received these on Nov 10th, and just a week ago the zipper broke on my left boot. I might have just gotten unlucky but the boots were never abused.. I have contacted Cat5 in hopes of getting this resolved and will update."
5,Converse Boots,These boot are awesome. They came out of the box with a new leather smell. I am still breaking them in now but so far they are great boots. Even when running through snow they will keep your toes warm. One bad thing I found out is that they are a little bigger than what you order. At least mine are not to large. The side zipper makes getting into and out of them easier than pulling your foot out of the whole boot. These are awesome.
5,work boots,"boots are great felt good first day I wore them, I recieved them within a week would recomend,"
3,like but wrong toe,"like this shoe very muchordered size 11 1/2used them in Iraq and Afghanistan but for some reason they came in ,in a composit toe which I really hate"
1,Zipper?,there is not a picture of both sides of the boot. I can't see if these are in regs for the Army.
5,great boots but took three weeks before they shipped,"as the title says, the boots are great second pair that i have purchased. but the company (not amazon) took three weeks before they shipped."
5,Bestest Boots Ever!,They arrived fast and I am truley spoiled with the zipper action. They litterally broke in to the shape of my foot in one hour. I use them everyday for work and I will buy again.
3,So So,It took about three weeks to get them broken in. I had to force bend areas around the heel away from my ankle bones to keep them from rubbing sores on my ankles. They are still not what I thought they should be for comfort. But they get a little bit better each time I wear them.
1,Worst boot ever!,Uncomfortable from day one. I been wearing these boots for 6 months now and still hurt my feet. Do not buy. The $25 boots at BIg 5 are better.
4,very comfortable,Very comfortable boots. Was having problems wearing the linesman/logger boots. They feel just like a pair if sneakers. Would not recommend for working in wet environments. I work on boilers and in pretty harsh environments. They have worn well. Have had them about 3 months . Shipping is very slow.
5,Love these boots,Absolutly love converse boots.Only draw back was I didn't them in wide so I can't wear the ones I ordered.I even tried thinner insoles which worked on the right foot but still cramped the left one.Best if you can try them on at the store first.I also own the soft toe version and never had any issues.Very comfortable for all day wear.Over all if the size is right worth the money.
4,Impressions of the Santa Fe Trail,"The journals collected in ""On the Santa Fe Trail,"" arranged chronologically, detail the breadth of experiences travelers had on the Santa Fe Trail. Some were plainly long and boring, others ended tragically. Simmons introduces each journal helpfully. Some of the writers even had a little bit of humor to add. It's a short book and a good starting point for people who want to get an idea of what traveling on the Santa Fe Trail was like."
2,"You do not ""need"" this book","If you have a Visor, you are a step ahead of the game. If you can turn it on by yourself, you can skip the first chapter.This gives little information to anyone who has done any research into their PDA choice. Most of the info covered in this book is easily found on the 'Net in one form or another. The Handspring/Visor specific information does not add any overwhelming value to this guide.This book would be a helpful guide to someone who may have gotten a Visor as a gift and is pretty clueless as to how to begin, but to anyone who has an even passing familiarity with a PalmOS device, this book offers little."
3,Limited Utility for Visor owners using MacIntosh,"The book is great if you use a Window based computer. However, the author directs you to ""...Dummies for Palm Pilot"" for MAC related Handspring Visor issues.If you are a Mac user I recommend the book, ""Visor"" by Broida and Johnson."
1,"Deficient ""Handspring Visor For Dummies""","Bill Dyszel appears to be unfamiliar with ""Expense"" for the Visor. ""Frankly, the program is limited and is best for people who need to track business spending in order to file expense reports. Even for those people,......... It requires you to choose a description of each expenditure from a noncustomizable list.... It's hard to make the Expense application useful if you can't enter the exact type of expenses you incur."" Mr. Dyszel should have reviewed the ""Visor Handheld User Guide"" for information on ""Customizing existing sample templates"" and on ""Programming the mapping table"" to create a customized expense report. Since I purchased the ""Handspring Visor For Dummies"" for the sole purpose of getting a simpler and more detailed explanation of the customization process, my money was completely wasted."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring music that makes you get up and dance!","This is a gorgeous album. This is not only a musically beautiful album, but also an ethically beautiful album. Check out the band website (...) for details of how the Baka musicians (of the Baka Pygmy Tribe from the rainforest in Cameroon, who are the inspiration for and recorded for and sampled in the music for Baka Beyond) are paid exactly the same as all the other musicians who play on the album and how those royalties get turned into projects (Decided on by the Baka themselves) that help the whole of the Baka community, a marginalised culture in a very corrupt part of the world.The music on the album is sublime, there are some 'Baka only' tracks and they are beautiful. The harmonies are incredible and very evocative, especially with the sounds of the rainforest audible in the back ground.The music of Baka Beyond will make you want to get up and dance, it's lively, positive and even better live!"
5,nice classic anime,one of the best anime i've seen i remember seeing for the first time bring back me back but a must buy
1,Very disappointed,"It has 3 cd's. The T. Rex one has a very boring game. The Learn about Dinosaurs cd is animated which was very boring for both of my grandsons. The third cd, Waling with Dinosaurs was hard to install and the videos are not very good to watch. Don't waste your money on this software."
2,meghan kehrer,"¿Qué vas a ser cuando tu casa te quemo al suelo, tiene un conde que quiere tu fortuna que dejaron tus parientes cuando murieron, y el conde que quiere tu fortuna ha matado a tu tío y siempre están buscando a ti? Estos son los problemas de los niños Baudelaire cuando fueron a vivir con tía Josephine. Toda estaba bien (si piensas que viviendo con una mujer que es loca para la gramática y tiene miedo de casi todo imaginable es bien). Pero cuando los niños fueron a la marqueta para comprar cosas para la cena toda van mal.Yo recomendó este libro a todos que le gusta las historias de aventuras y quiere un historia con un pedacito de humor."
5,Encyclopedia of weight training,Excellent resource: This book covers a wide variety of subjects relating to fitness and provides a tremendous depth of knowledge to anyone who is serious about fitness.
2,ANSWER KEY/SPELLING/WORDLY WISE 1000 2,"THE BOOKLET WAS NEW AND FINE, BUT THERE ARE TWO EDITIONS AND THIS IS THE FIRST EDITION, AND OUR SPELLING BOOK IS THE 2ND. EDITION, SO IT DOENS'T WORK AT ALL. ONLY $3.25 SO NOT A GREAT LOSS, BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER DESCRIPTION ON THE ITEM."
5,A Twenty-First Century Delight,"Nutritionally Sound is a solid, original and highly evocative work. Original and technically brilliant, Nutritionally Sound breaks new, musical ground. This is nothing short of a musical treat of the highest caliber, one that should not be missed for any reason."
4,Richard Dawkins Collection,"I haven't viewed this yet but, based on Richard Dawkin's book, The God Delusion, and the video, The Root of all Evil, I am sure I will enjoy it."
2,Doesn't hold up --,"Fan worked well at poolside, but you have to sit at least 8 - 10 feet away or you will get wet. Construction is cheap, with lightweight base and flimsy plastic in critical stress areas. We kept fan covered when not in use, but fan grate and screws started rusting within 6 months. Plastic cracked at rotating shaft housing in our second season, and the fan head finally fell off today. Did not last two full summer seasons."
1,Customer Service is even worse than their product!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the biggest piece of junk you can buy. It will drown you from lack of wind to disperse the mist. The base is all cheap plastic and if you need support from them forget it. Their support is worse than their products. Pay more for better fan but at least you will have something useable. Mine is going in the garbage this week, I have been waiting 11 days for a reply to emails I sent because they will not talk to you on the 800 Customer service number. GAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Sexy Soul!!,I thought i had heard it all and then i stumbled across Blue Magic. These guys are so silky they can melt the hardest of hearts. If you like 'SOUL' that was made for loving a woman in ways that words can't express then you 'MUST' have the album-PERIOD. I can guarantee that you will be taken to a place that is ethereal . Now brace yourself because life is just about to get sweet.
3,Blue with Magic,"I enjoyed this cd of Blue Magic very good songs I love to sing and dance to. Songs like ""Look me up"", ""Magic"", ""Sideshow"" with ""What comes over me"", you can't get no better then this. I was in high school when these songs came out and everyone in high school sang and loved the songs of Blue Magic. They were good performaers also. This is real Old School love songs that are great to listen to again and again."
4,Blue Magic indeed!,"I must admit that I tracked this album after listening to 'Look me up' on the radio during an excellent soul show (Soul Cellar). I wanted an album that had as many tracks as possible in the hope that there would be some other gems. I was not disappointed. All n' all a very delightful album and, one for any soul fan's collection."
4,Mellow sounds,"You will find this groups mellow sounds easy on the ears, even better on the mind after a hard days work."
5,uniquely different,"I enjoyed the book-the unique subject matter--aging ,senile father--distraught,overburdened daughter and their communication and unique intent toward one another.However, the author should have defined chapters. Every pagewas a continuation of the other. I found it very annoying. Perhaps because it all took place in one day--, pauses and time to reflect through chapters would have made it easier to read(I dept loosing my place-paragraph after paragraph. It was tedious. All in all, the book was well written andthecharacters very real and well protrayed. Bravo"
3,printer cartridges,"The black cartridge works ok, but couldn't get the color cartridge to work. The bubble package was split open but the boxes the cartridges came in did not appear to have been open. I think maybe they were just old."
5,"M T V INC,","POOR , INK SUPPLY VERY SHORT. I GOT RIPPED OFF. I BELIEVE THIS WAS A STARTER SUPPLY INK CARTRIDGE."
4,Arc - The Movie,Received movie in good condition and enjoyed this unique film which has quality actors. Blake Robbins was especially convincing as the father of the missing child.
1,"This isn't a book, it's a brochure","...and a pitifully meager one at that. I saw Shui-Bo Wang's short film, and was quite moved by it. But don't spend $15 on this item thinking it in any way a book that captures the power of the film's message or art. It's just a tiny, repetitive, thin promotional brochure with almost no content. I packed my flimsy little copy up and returned it to Amazon within minutes of arrival. (I initally almost tossed it out, mistaking it for one of those little sales brochures Amazon puts packs with orders sometimes.) Save yourself the return postage and simply avoid buying it in the first place."
1,A real disappointment,"Expecting a real thesaurus, I was greatly disappointed. Every word I tried to look up wasn't listed until I tried ""run"". I'm not going to keep this book, it is useless to me. Maybe I'll offer it to a elementary school student."
5,Great west coast music,"If you are a fan of Sneaker, it's great to have this album with previously unreleased material. Check out their studio albums ""Sneaker"" and ""Loose in the world""."
3,Techno World Groove,"Candice Pacheco, one of the co-founders of the all woman techno/art/music ensemble D'Cuckoo, turns in a solid disc of techno world groove music.I am not overly fond of the basic genre to which this type of music belongs - i.e. rave/techno. But Ms. Pacheco's use of cross cultural rhythms and vocals, and her interesting transformations through digital sampling of instruments such as the flute and the oud create a post-modern, cool and sometimes bubbly, global silicon groove that simply works for me.And, in case you were wondering, the liner notes explain that the title of this disc (""if then. . .else"") is taken from some programming code originally used in a D'Cuckoo track."
4,THe Christmas Wreath,"The title of the book that I read was The Christmas Wreath, by James Hoffman. It was a delightful Christmas picture book that had very prety illusttions. I thought this book was prety good. THis story is aout a polar bear that got a Christmas wreath stuck on his head and called it a necklace. The wreath caught seaweed and other plants and froze under water. THen the bear hung it back up on a door on the door. Then it shined beautifly in the coid night. I thougt this book was a great Cristmas book. the pictures were nice and colorful. In the book nothing bad happened to the bear."
5,Hilarious and true,"'MARBLES' is wry, dry, ridiculous, and dead-on. It takes a miracle to make me laugh out loud, but Corcoran succeeded several times. A couple of times, he actually gave me cramps.If you want to know about how much fun television used to be in the 'good old days', read this book."
1,...and the few marbles are widely scattered.,"I'm a former radio/TV journalist of 20 years -- the same as the author -- and agree with many of his points about the state of TV news: the superficiality, the ""star system"" for anchors and anchorettes, the ""If it bleeds, it leads"" mentality, and all the rest. However, his writing is all over the map. Corcoran often departs on flights of self-indulgent fancy before getting back to whatever main point he is making at the moment. As a hard-core newswriter from the ""old school,"" I find it ponderous and, despite his completely valid criticisms, not worth the effort."
4,Tramontina steak knives,"These are the only knives I have that really stay sharp with no help from me. I have some older ones too, slightly larger, that I've had for years and never have to sharpen. So, they're always the ones I reach for in the drawer-they don't need to be in any kind of holder either to preserve the edge, and into the dishwasher they go--all the time. So, yes, I would recommend these."
3,Not much new...,"In the research on contemporary immigration and identity formation, Professor Kibria has done some pretty good work on gender negotiations (In journal such as gender and society) as well as other aspects of identity. In this book however there's just not much in this book here that noone else has touched on, the research is pretty extensive and comprehensive in its scope and does capture the social field of Second generation Asian Americans- but there really is not much depth and in the end, there's nothing new..."
5,Gorgeous ring!,I just received my lovely garnet sterling silver poison ring today. It is so gorgeous! It fits my finger perfectly so the sizes listed are very accurate. The detail on the ring is just as shown in the photos. It was shipped very quicly after I purchased it. I have nothing negative to say about this ring or this seller! :o)
1,Piece of junk machine,"I've had two of these machines. I exchanged the first one bacause every handle on it broke off, the pot, the filter basket, everything just crumbled. The second one went down the same path and tonight the glass pot broke too. I'm looking for one that isn't a piece of junk."
2,didn't last,Great to have a cheap latte maker and for the six months it worked it made good latte but the milk frother quit working within the first six months. It isn't inexpensive if you have to buy it twice a year. It might be worth trying with the 2-year guarantee.
3,Fine performances. This is not the best box to get.,"These are mono, sprightly and worth hearing. But the main point of this review is to steer you to a new edition that will set you back way less than this out of print box. The new one comes with Bruckner symphony performances as well and is is much kinder to your wallet. Check around."
2,SHE'S NO DIVA!!!!,"I listened to the Journey and I discovered that Jayne Olderman is only singing on two songs, and they're the worst ones on the cd.What about the singers and artists with the real talent?Wondering why we're not hearing about them and their great contributions to this obviously worthwhile project!I went to the Red Warrior website and its just all about Jayne very little about anyone else.It just seems strange!!!!!"
5,EXCELLENT INSTRUCTIONAL BOOK,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS AND I MUST AGREE IT IS A GREAT BOOK, EASY TO FOLLOW AND FIGURE OUT THE PREMISE OF THE GAME. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO START TO PLAY MAHJONG..."
4,Even an idiot knows it is played with 2 dice,"The reviewer who was confused about the counting of tiles for each player at start of play and use of dice obviously is challenged. The counting is very easy. I sometimes get confused on who should be what ""wind"" or methods of goulash but building the wall,and starting the game is easy after you do it a few times. The terminology is clear and easy if you have ever played Rummy as a child. Thompson's writing is clear and easy for a novice."
4,Where is she now???,"I have all Helen's early albums on vinyl...this CD is very good and gives you just a taste of what this talented woman is capable of...why she never made it as a great songstress of our time is confusing to me...if anyone out there knows where i can get her first two albums on CD's, ""Helen Schneider"" and ""Let It Be Me"", please email me! I only hope someone will put this incredible voice back to where it was once headed many years ago! Treat yourself and go get this CD! You'll be begging for more! Let's see if we can help her get just due!"
3,"Helen,,,where are you??????","This album is OK, but,,,,,,,what ever happened to the older stuff?? What about "" Let it Be Now""??? There were 2 great albums from her cabaret days!!!! What's happening with her today???????JHHJ@aol.com"
2,Get another book,The author is experience but does not really understand the true story. Some corrective actions he suggested was correct but the theory was totally wrong.
4,Great introduktion,The first 100 pages where realy great for all kind of developers.It's not just for Access people.Missing the CD and there are some copying from the 2000 version.Still an importent book
4,Decent camcorder,"Being the first camcorder that I have, I can't really compare this with others. However, this camcorder is pretty decent. It's small and lightweight thus great for travel companion. The playback quality is pretty good. It may look blurry if you watch it on the LCD, but looks much better when you plug it to your TV. It uses Hi-8 tape, which is more expensive compare to 8mm. The nightshot feature is not that great, it's blurry (black and white of course). So if you are buying this camcorder for its nightshot capability, I'd suggest browsing for a different one. The battery only lasts about 80-90 minutes (with LCD screen and non-continuous recording), and it takes about 2.5 hours to fully charge it.Overall, it is still a good camcorder, especially for beginners and for daily use."
3,You can do better,"There are plenty of decent, basic Hi-8 cameras out there with nightshot and flipout LCD viewfinders. My advice? Get one of those.My company uses the TRV118 to rent to customers because it's supposed to be easy to operate and pretty much dummy proof, but customers complain if they have to change a tape, and I don't blame them. I don't know who had the bright idea to put the tape door on the bottom of the camera, but I sure hope they're not working for Sony any more!In order to change tapes (god forbid your daughter's dance recital is a minute longer than the standard 60 minutes) you have to remove the camera from the tripod, unscrew the base plate, pop the tapes and screw everything back together. And just that quick, you missed the debut performance of your own future Broadway star!There's nothing Sony can do to make up for the frustration and lost moments used up changing tapes, except perhaps take it back and give you a coupon for a Canon ZR70MC MiniDV!"
3,beware,now... i bought this cam not long at all maybe about six months now..... and well lets jus say it was cool at first it's not brodcast quality video or nuthin jus a simple camcorder. BUT!! now the camera doesn;t wanna work in camera mode i mean the camera shows a black and white blurry screen in the view finder and the lcd screen.and the sony people aren't even tryin 2 help they tryin 2 sell me some official sony cleaner thing... look out when buying
3,Correction to an Earlier Review.,Please note at at least one point the review of book in question is wrong. Hong Kong repealed corporal punishment/caning in on Nov. 1 1990. I believe the author of the review has confused Singapore with Hong Kong.
1,Don't Like,"I truly don't like this book. The flow of information is not great to me, and the book is very heavy and bulky. I wish Uphold and Graham would produce a 2011 version of their book. It is much better. The reading is easy and user friendly but the transition from general information to management could be better. Likewise, the book is on point with medications and treatment, just could be written better, and soft back is preferred."
4,Primary Care,"Buttaro's Primary Care A Collaborative Practice has been a key component in the Family Nurse Practitioner curriculum at the university I am currently attending. It is broken up into body systems and then specific conditions are outlined which makes it very easy to use. It is lacking in some places and can be a little tedious to read at times but overall it is very helpful and with each disease being broken up into sections that include history, physical exam, differentials, and diagnostics it makes it easy to jump right to the information you are looking for. Patient education could be expanded in some sections."
2,Page numbers please!!!!,"This book is a great book, comparable to my other texts. However this is a TEXT book for COLLEGE work. I do not read it from cover to cover. I am assigned reading, which I complete, and then I am tested on the material. Sometimes the reading assigned is ""Ch. 4-9"". Super. Sometimes it is ""Pgs. 236-259"". How in the world am I supposed to navigate that?Unless all text books in the Kindle edition come with page numbers enabled SOON, I will be buying them on paper. I do not recommend the Kindle edition of this book to students. It is difficult to find the information you need. I am too busy to have to worry about navigating the book.I do not have a single assignment from this course that is the whole chapter. It is all page numbers. I am afraid for my grade!!"
2,Don't judge a book by its cover (or a picture of it),"Although relatively good, this book was overall dissapointing. Of all the cinematographers featured on the cover picture shown above, only a third of them appear in the book. What happened to the great DP's like Tak Fujimoto, Vilmos Zsigmond, Russell Carpenter, Laszlo Kovacs, Dante Spinotti, and Haskel Wexler to name a few?! The book does have some insight, but not enough to make it worth buying. Instead, I recommend you go for its predecessor, ""Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art."" Or, if you are looking for a REALLY good book on cinematography, try ""Cinematography: Screencraft."" Both Wexler and Sven Nykvist are there, as well as geniuses like Darius Khondji (""Se7en,"" ""City of Lost Children,"" and ""Delicatessen"") and Janusz Kaminski (""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and the upcoming ""AI: Artificial Intelligence""). At least these two books will give you a more insightful and rewarding experience than this one."
4,Still worth a look.,"A follow up to the author's first book, this continues the style of the first and is every bit as good.DP's interviewed are: 2nd Unit DP Mike Benson (Sliver, Volcano), Peter James (Driving Miss Daisy), Daryn Okada (Lake Placid), TV DP Neil Roach (Of Mice and Men), Commercial DP Ward Russell (Days of Thunder), Nancy Schrieber (Blair Witch Hunt), John Schwartzman (Pearl Harbour), Dean Semler (Dances With Wolves), Dante Spinotti (Heat), Ueli Steiger (Godzilla), and Vilmos Zsigmond (Bonfire of the Vanities).Unlike the previous reviewer, I think this book is worth it. There are always going to be great DP's missed out (the author apologises for some who didn't make the first volume, due to unfinished interviews), but that just allows for future volumes. However he is correct about the cover ... the image shown here lists far more names than actually made it, and is different in that respect from the cover of my copy."
4,A great album!,"For me Fatback has been a great funk group, and I think that so many other people, expecially today's young people, had to know the music of this group."
3,"I loved King Tim III personality jock, classic, pure rap","I would give myself five stars but that would be a bit pretentious on my behalf. However I truly feel that I helped establish an art that not many thought would go beyond the fly sounds of Kurtis Blow, and hip hop sounds of RunDMC. I truly feel blessed to be part of such great history in the making. For those who need to contact me please do so at 212-234-1266. I am open to discussion on that era an what it meant to me. I am in the process of getting a E-mail in the meantime please use my brothers cmrichao.@pibly.orgsincerely,King Tim III personality jock"
3,"I loved King Tim III personality jock, classic, pure rap",Alright yall here we go I'm the K-I-N-G- the T-I-M Everytime I here this guy it picks me up and takes me to an era of rap that could never be duplicated. To everything there is a begining and what better start for rap than with the upbeat tempo and malonious voice of King Tim III personality jock.
5,DJ Prince,"Yes, in case you didn't know King Tim III was the first rapper of this new rap age on wax. How I know? I was his DJ! I have no idea who is Richard Omega! King Tim's real name is Tim Washington. He grew up in the Delano Houses on 139th st and 5th ave. in Harlem. If I remember correctly it was building #15. Tim, Anthony Bee, and myself put together the demo tape which put King Tim III on the map for Spring Records. There was also a major push given to us by Jimmy Castor. The last time I heard anything about Tim he was on the west coast. I have tried to contact this other guy Richard on a number of occasions but, have yet to get a call back. So please disregard this imposter Richard Omega or what ever his name is."
3,First Rap Song Ever on this Disc,"Not many people realize it, but ""King Tim III: Personality Jock"" was actually the first rap song ever released. Most people assume it's ""Rapper's Delight,"" which actually came out later the same month.""King Tim"" is actually a pretty damn funky song; although the rapping is primarily at the beginning and in the middle. There are some serious funk jams on this record that still sound fresh. If you're a fan of old-school funk, this is a must-have. Plus, you can impress friends and loved ones by explaining to them that only educated musicologists know that ""King Tim"" was the first rap song..."
1,Anybody wonder why this is so expensive?,"I guess I can be generous to the other reviews. They seem to be written soon after this book was released.The errors are not just with the maps. This is a poster child for sloppy historical workmanship. A review of this book by Michael P. Johnson, in ""William and Mary Quarterly"" Oct '01 completly shredded the book and stated that the actual record indicated exactly the reverse of Pearson's conslusion. The Johnson review earned the prize from the Organization of American Historians for the best journal article of that year in all of American History, in spite of the fact that the President of that organization had written a blurb for the back cover praising the book.The Pearson could not even get it right in the book title--there was no trial.The current price for this book is so high because the publisher withdrew the book and tried to recover all copies."
4,great cookie cutter,"love this cookie cutter....the cookies are so cute, just have to roll the dough thinner than for usual cut-outs"
4,"lots of useful information, came with CD","I got this book for a Music class and it was very useful, had lots of information about various cultures (American Indian, Indian, African, etc.)"
3,"Good, but for the price, and for being a college text, should be better.","For one, some very important regions (Middle East, for example) are missing from this ""World Music"" text book. It also seems to be a bit choppy in the efforts to highlight the most relevant areas of regional music. Rather than taking an overview perspective of each region, the author delves fairly in-depth into certain divisions of the specific examples he seems to find most interesting.Since the book is intended to be an overview, I would have like to have had a systematic approach to each region, and the traditions, influences, instruments and patterns seen in each type of music. It wasn't that easy to follow, although the information provided was interesting. Unfortunately, there's not a lot out there in this subject, so there is little competition.As with all text books, the price is immoral!"
1,Incomplete,I returned this item. There were not separate parts for cello and violin. This is just the piano part with cello and violin cues.
3,Wrong book - but friendly service processing return,"Not much to say about the book, as I did not keep it due to it not being the book ordered (nor described); book was to be 2nd printing (as pictured) and I received a 1st printing edition, which is not what I wanted to fill my collection. Seller was prompt and courteous in addressing my request for refund (never tried to question the validity of my complaint), which at least made up for the initial disappointment."
2,Not as good as Spirits of the Canyon,"Anhinga is an ensemble of musicians in which the Native American flute is the most important instrument. Because I liked Spirits of the Canyons a lot, being an excellent piece of Native American Flute mastery, I expected a lot form this CD. With all due respects, I was pretty disappointed. The melodies seem very repetitive, gone is the tension they created through the use of the classical guitar on their first album. Not only are the songs very monotone, this could be said of the entire album. I really had to force myself to listen through a single song, let stand the entire album. So, if you want to buy a CD by Anhinga my advice would be to buy Spirits of The Canyon."
2,Tough To Get Through,"Mr. Austin has a way with music, that's for sure. I enjoyed his ""A Christmas Carol,"" but this show was turned off after the third song. The first song was confusing, the singing sometimes adequate, and often the lyrics were rushed into the melody lines without much thought. Many times the emPHAsis was ON the WRONG sylABle. It's tough to write a show and I admire his chutzpah in going for it. Still, this show wasn't my favorite of his work, and I've heard quite a bit of it.I remain a fan, and look forward to the next musical from you."
5,Robin of Sherwood Set 2,This really is excellent. It engages the viewer from the first episode and expands the relationship between the characters in the following episodes in a realistic and human way. Very enjoyable. I reccomend it.
5,Definitely the Best Book for Cello Beginners,"When I first started teaching, I had my students use the two method books I grew up using. Since the ABCs Cello Books came on the market, though, I've switched all my students over with excellent results. This book, as well as Books 2 and 3, definitely constitute the best series I've ever encountered for beginning cellists.Mr. Rhoda's original tunes are very listenable and lie nicely under the fingers, every bit as effective as the popular melodies found throughout. The exercises progress logically, scales and duets work well, and there are plenty of tunes to illustrate the various concepts. Everything's cleanly presented and well put together.Highest recommendation!"
5,Top Drawer!,"Yes, top drawer!A very easy to read music book with simple instructions in the intro. There are also little fill in schedules of how much you played everyday.Nice well known songs are included.A must have for absolute beginners."
1,Taylor Made Products Stainless Steel Rail Mount Boat Flag Pole Socket,"For horizontal rails only. Does not 'adjust to any angle'. Has small number of angles which are determined by the number of holes drilled. Actual number of holes drilled are less than indicated by the picture. If mounted on a vertical rail, cannot project the flag pole at 90 degrees."
2,Not as pictured,"I agree with most of the observations of the previous review.The item looks nothing like the one in the picture.I'm keeping it because I think I can make it work for myboat anyway, but the photo and description do not representthe item, other than that it should fit 7/8"" to 1 1/4"" railingsand 3/4"" to 7/8"" flagpoles. Bolts protrude nearly an inchfrom the top so I'll need to replace them with ones that fit better.Amazon should drop this item or redo the photo and description."
5,A one-sitting whopper of a story...,"If you liked Deliverance, you'll love Trespass. This book combines corporate politics with outdoor adventure in a whirlwind ride that you will not soon forget. Give it a try, if you can find a copy"
5,What people are saying vs. the story,"There are inaccuracies in some of the above criticisms...like for instance the customer who stated that the words on the cover, ""...story of the four chaplains"" was a typo and should have been, ""...story of four chaplains."" This is completely inaccurate as the gentlemen in mention are icons known as ""THE Four Chaplains."" The customer's complete misinformation stated as 'fact' in [their] review makes me wonder about the validity of [their] other comments.My suggestion, read the book for the ""true story"" within -- whether it feels like narrative non-fiction, or novel-style non-fiction is up to you to like or dislike; but the story is well and passionately presented by an author to whom the story obviously has precious meaning.The book is lovely because the story is lovely. There's just no losing that. Well done."
4,Sea of Glory,"If you like a mystery and history this is a book you will not want to miss. The four chaplains, from different religious backgrounds, aboard the Dorchester weave a mixture of how God supplies the right people at the right time - even war time. Recently I saw ""Pearl Harbor"" at the movies and felt great pride of being an American when I walked out of that movie. That same feeling went through me as I read this book. This is a ""MUST READ"" for baby-boomers like myself. We must never forget what was was really like. This book will give us a peek at the sacrafices many made for each of us to enjoy freedom today."
4,a tale of faith and courage,"Generally I am opposed to the fictionalization of true stories; my reason is that it trivializes real events and real people. For example, the tragic scope of the Titanic sinking is never depicted richly enough in fiction or movies, where we follow the stories of a few when there are as many stories as there are people involved.I will make an exception for this World War II story. ""Sea of Glory"" is well-crafted and easy to read, and will probably find a wide audience as books about WWII are popular these days. My only criticism is that the authors get a little syrupy in depicting the relationship among the four chaplains, which rings a little too good to be true. Surely they had some differences now and then, as we all do.....Nevertheless, all four men were heroes, without a doubt, and their inspirational story deserves to be heard."
5,Sea of Glory,"This book is a fascinating story of the dark days of WWIIand I recommend this to anyone that has any problems relating to people and religions.I am a police chaplain in a very diverse community with occasional interreligious and ratial misunderstandings.I purchased this book for some of my colleagues for Xmas and I am sure that they will find it a moving story, well written,easy to read with a message for all of us in today's world."
3,Disappointed,"I was eager to know about the heroism of these WWII chaplains, but was disappointed by the one-dimensional, simplistic characterization of these men and those they encountered on this voyage. They deserve a better written account"
4,Truly Men of Honor,"This book is one that makes you feel good without being mushy. It brings out the best in men regardless of their religion. When these Chaplains acted as men of the cloth they made a tremendous difference in a setting that was full of death.Being a Chaplain myself, I truly enjoyed the book and it was a shot in the arm for all of man to care for the rest of mankind.This book based on facts is one to read during a nice evening in front of the fireplace and the telephone off the hook."
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, A WARNING!","A horrible movie, Monique rolling around on a bed in lingerie, talking to the viewer. Should of skipped a few trips to the buffet and the hagendaz bars, cellulite supreme. Very dull, poorly made, way overpriced even for free! Worst movie of this kind I've ever seen and I've seen a lot, trust me. When should I stop?"
2,Re-recordings...,"The reason this ""compilation"" is so inexpensive is because these are all re-recordings, not the originals. That would explain the ""clear"" sound quality (mentioned earlier) as well."
3,john lennon and beyond,"John Lennon Beatles and beyondThe book that I read was john Lennon and beyond. The author of this book is David k. Wright. The book was copyrighted in 1996.I think for the most part the Author got his point across, I liked when the writer was talking about when the group invaded the United States with their music in the 60's.It told me a few things that I didn't know about, for example I didn't know that he was married three times, I only told me about his last marriage with a lady named Yoko Uno.One important thing that book didn't tell me about that I wanted to know about like what his life was like before he joined the group like where he grew up and thing about his childhood.I also wanted to know what got him started in music and what made him interested to become a musician.I liked that it told me a lot about John LennonThat he was a cool peaceful person and loved life, and did a lot for the world!!!!!!!!!"
1,Misleading Ad,Again MSC can't get their act together with posting ads on Amazon. There is only one wheel in this purchase not the pack of ten as stated. I brought this to MSC's attention weeks ago but the ad still implies there is ten! Be very careful when buying from MSC on the Amazon site. Two out of two purchases from MSC have been incorrectly presented.
4,Great album from a great band,"Even though this album has been dubbed over from LP to CD (original master tapes missing), it still makes for great listening. A real blast from the past. Excellent stuff from a classic South African rock band. Thanks guys for re-releasing this album."
4,A few problems,"If this hadn't been on sale, with free shipping, and an overall good buy, I would have given this much lower than a 4. I found that it was easy to put together, but mine is in pieces and needs some ""fixing"", so the quality isn't, in my estimation, that great. The lips on the shelves (very flimsy) all came off. Every single one. The staples aren't straight, so I can't just pop them back on.I've changed my nearly 2 year old on it (she's under 30 lbs) and it is a very sturdy product. I haven't figured out how to organize stuff on it, because I too have an older child in everything. I wish the company offered an extra cover for the changing pad. Since it is a specially sized mat, you have to order it from the company, and I don't feel 16$ is worth the thin poor quality cover that comes with it."
1,"Low quality, not worth the money of the trouble","Low quality work, the finish is not as nice as it looks in the website photo. The changing pad shape is non standard so you better take this into account because buying another pad or a cover is very hard (if not impossible). The pad that comes with the table is very cheap, I would not recommend using it. We ended up returning it."
2,Product does not match picture,"I received my changing table today and I put it together - it was very easy and no problem for someone in her 9th month of pregnancy. I got all the parts and I was pleasantly surprised by the sturdiness of the table. However, the second and third shelves of my table are not as shown on the picture. The shelves have a rectangular shape and do not reach all the way into the corner, so things can fall off in the space behind the table. The inconsistency is even in the assembly instructions - the front picture matches the one here, but the part description shows rectangular second and third shelves. So I called their customer service and they told me that the product was changed and I can return it if I would like. Very poor answer... They gave me the number to their corporate office, which was answered by a generic message. (I left a VM.) I do not like being misled in this way and I was expecting to get new shelves mailed to me."
1,Descrition is not accurate,"In the description part of the dvd, says that the audio you can select are: english or spanish, but the spanish audio does not exist, is a lie."
2,It was not in Spanish,I read all the information that appeared in the site regarding this video. It said that it was in English and Spanish but It was not possible to play the video in Spanish.
5,Good Fun for Grandchildren,"This DVD ranks at the top of our choices for our grandchildren, ages 2, 4, 5, and 6. Hi-5 not only inspires little ones to sing and dance along with performers, it teaches them to accept the differences in individuals and cultures. When we first discovered Hi-5, we had to have DVDs and CDs for each household. We are happy to add Move Your Body and Action Heroes to our collection. A GOOD BUY!"
2,hi5,the dvd its good but in the descrption of the products say in the language: english and spanish. but the language of the dvd is only in englisho. romo
3,"My 2 yrs. old LOVES It, But...","My 2 yrs. old, loves it, but it doesn't have both english and spanish languages as listed. That was the main reason I took a chance and order it. But for us who want to teach our children both languages, it DOES NOT have a spanish option."
3,"Boring, but informative","The book was okay nothing special, it was very informative but the information could have been delivered in a better format. If you are looking for information on the theory of criminal behavior and don't mind a boring read this book is for you!"
5,Lotta fun,"Best book on weather I've read since Bomar's Texas Weather. As in Bomar's book, the author understands that it's the unusual weather events that are of most interest to most people, and he doesn't fail to disappoint on that score. A must for all weather nuts."
5,Weather Maniacs Rejoice!,"I loved this book! The photos are great, nice thick book, and a wealth of info on the coldest, hottest, wettest, windiest, etc. You'll like it if you enjoy weather, records, trivia, reading about geography, etc.Big color photos, tornadoes, floods, maps, some historic photos too."
3,Problem Fixed,When my poster never showed up I wrote a not so nice review of their company. Within a few hours I recieved an email from the company with sincere apologies. They refunded my money and sent me a new one. They scored an A for customer service. Thank you!
3,Curse that plastic nub that holds the paper,"Not as generous as the other review that commented on the plastic nub that holds the information/logo about the level. It took me a good hour, to remove it, and ended up scratching the area around it when I first used my hands, followed pliers and wire cutters, thinking that it can be cut and easily removed. In the end, I used a pen to pop it out. The magnet is strong enough to hold its own weight. there's also a window on the top that allows to see the center bubble from the side. A decent level, but they should have had instructions as to how to remove the nub."
4,Works fine,"Not much to say. I have no complaints. It works fine. Serves my needs. It is small, but that's no issue for me."
4,I keep this in my tool belt,I use this level all the time when I'm working. The manufacturers should take a survey and ask how many times in a career you have used the 45 degree bubble and how many times a day you need the vertical bubble. I would make one with two vertical bubbles so you don't have to constantly flip it around to see.
3,Ludacris meets the Natives,"Ok, I listened to two of the preview tracks and it was all I could take. Normally I enjoy pow-wow/authentic Native American drum pieces. But this is too abrasive for me. If it's not Ludacris sitting in on this, it has definitely been influenced by the ghost of Janis Joplin! Needless to say, it didn't help me to tune into my Cherokee roots."
3,"Nice idea... bits are very small [""precision""]","I was expecting slightly more solid construction for the $5 [that should have been the list price!]...it's more like a manufacturer's branded give-away tool kit. Don't expect too much...probably good for computers, cell phones etc."
4,Great Screwdriver Set,This is a great screwdriver set for opening up MacBooks and replacing hard drives and/or memory. This is the second one I bought and this one was for my daughter. I love it.
4,"Lots of energy,sounds like fun, a big sound, great hits.","I liked his hits in Australia in the 60s. Transistor Sister, If You Were A Rock & Roll Record are representative of the era. Jump Over is a great tune and typical of the ""catchy"" love tunes."
2,A repetitive and monotonous album,"I was quite disappointed in this CD actually. It's so repetitive that I literally checked to see if the CD player had restarted instead of moving to the next disc... nope, it was just track 7. It's basically track after track of drums, all the same beat, with vocals and other things on top occasionally. The drums aren't even organic-sounding -- they sound like my brother's drum kit. The vocals etc are usually harsh and unpleasant. It sounds like someone decided to jump on the ""let's make a drum album with chant-y, Deep Forest-y vocals"" bandwagon, and it just comes across wrong to me.I am a fan of Tangerine Dream (both old and new), Deep Forest, Enigma... that type of music. If you're interested in that, I suggest checking out ""Big Drum, Small World"" by the Dhol Foundation instead; I really like that album. I'll write a review when I get a chance."
2,Don't expect too much from this rather strange album.,"I bought this CD on the strength of hearing the composer's haunting soundtrack which accompanied the ""concept"" video/DVD ""Planetary Traveller"". As a fan of New Age/Instrumental Rock I was expecting something in the same vein, similar to Tangerine Dream or Christopher Franke. Unfortunately this was not the case. The composer has attempted to bring together different styles of world music and the resulting mix sounds a bit like Peter Gabriel during his ethnic period, but on Mogadon... The title track is okay and a couple of others are just about listenable, but I will not be listening to it in the car. On balance this is not an album I would recommend unless you really like this sort of music. If the composer happens to read this perhaps he would consider bringing out a more conventional album next time."
1,Excess noise overpowering,This CD player made a constant humming noise when plugged in. The noise was loud enough that you could also hear it over the music being played. I would not recommend this product.
1,You get what you pay for,"I thought buying a cheap mp3 playing cd player would be pretty safe, since I wasn't looking for anything to listen to my high end stuff. Well 25 bucks sounded too good to be true. First thing I noticed was an unGodly hum that has no rhyme or reason. I never heard the name Coby before and hope to never hear its name or its hum again. (you get what you pay for)"
2,"Bad sound quality, unstable CD player","The sound quality is very crapy. Unclear to hear. No stero effect.The CD player is very unstable against any movement, because the CD is loosely put inside. Basically it's struggeling to plays CDs when you carry it."
1,Not even worth the trouble,"My husband purchased the player for his desk at work, but tried testing it out at home. When the cd was in with the cover closed, it wouldn't spin. He tried every suggestion to make it work in the instructions (why would the instructions include something like that?) but to no avail. DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS GARBAGE!"
1,Repack,This item was a repack that had been returned and never should have been sent. It was NG. Probably intermittent. Item was returned.
1,Terrible quality,"I read all the comments but most of them were dated back to as early as2005 and hoping that the manufacturer increased the quality,I purchased two of these online, and returned both today.I had all the problems mentioned before, such as:1) Probably a screw was lose, and rattling inside one of the boomboxes.2) Loud humming noise when plugged in. The noise was so loud thatyou could even hear it when the music is being played.Not suitable for the lullabies at all.3) One of them couldn't read my CDs, CDRs, CDRWs, and mp3 discs.Trust me, I was not expecting a state-of-the art product ora high-tech sound quality. This one is truly unacceptable.This is the first and the only product I returned. I do notrecommend it at all."
4,Very satisfied with this player,"Purchased this for my Mother-in-Law, so she could listen to CD and MP3 (books etc). It's easy for her to operate and has good sound so she can hear it well. Comes with a power cord. Priced right."
1,Absolutely positively terrible,"I needed a small boombox for occasional use, so I didn't want to pay a lot for one. But man, even if this boombox had been less than five bucks it would still have deserved no more than 1 star. It was absolutely bad in every aspect. Like many others have said the CD player is virtually unusable, and sometimes it wouldn't turn on. I returned it and just ordered a Panasonic boombox."
1,Inexpensive unit that would be great if it worked as described,"Unit arrived broken - appeared to be a repackaged return. Something was lose and rattling inside the unit.To be fair, I never tried the unit as it appeared damaged."
1,COBY ELECTRONIC MP-CD451 am/fm radio MP3 CD PLAYER,"I bought this product for the CD player, so I cannot comment about the radio and MP3 freatures.I was very happy to receive this product after the wait for shipping. However, it would turn counter-clockwise 1/2 of the time rendering it useless. The portable player itself became very hot after using it for about 1/2 an hour. I decided not to get it replaced as I did not want to go through the whole process and end up with another useless player.So I opted to have my money refunded which cost me $2.00 for a defective product.I know Amazon is a good company, but I will purchase a similar product at a real store who will refund my purchase in full.I'd really like my $2.00 back as that is what it cost me in gas money to return it to a UPS store."
1,does not read disks,"I did not have high expectations for this CD player based on its price, but I did expect it to at least play CD's. Even when I first got it, I almost always had to push the play button multiple times to try and convince it that it did indeed have a CD inside it. It worked out for awhile like that, but now it insists that it never has a Cd inside it and won't change it's mind. It's not even a year old and all that works is the radio, which isn't too helpful because we don't get great reception and I got it to play my baby's music in the nursery. I don't think our thrift store will even take it, so it's basically too much money for what it is. A P.O.S. There is a reason I'd never heard of the Coby brand before."
4,Beware the Buzzzzzzzzz,"For the price, this is just fine. But as other buyers have mentioned, there is a constant ""buzz"" or electronic ""hum"" when it is on. It emanates from where the AC adapter cord plugs into the player. It's quite loud. We listen to this player to fall asleep, and even though it is across the room, if the volume is too low the buzz is audible over the music. Were it close by, it would be unbearable. Batteries would probably solve it. Otherwise, it works well, sounds good, has a small footprint, and you aren't out too much money. Let's you repeat one or all tracks, which is a plus."
4,Good MP3 player for the price,Good MP3 player for the price. The first unit came dead out of the box. The second unit is working for a few weeks.
2,Works then breaks,"Quality of this product is not good at all. It had all the features for a great price, mp3 capability, portability. After 45 or so days it just stopped working. Found out the warranty wont cover the product, stuck with a lemon."
4,Good Purchase,"I haven't used the cover much yet, but it seems like it is a great buy and would last for long. Fits perfect on my x61 Lenovo."
5,Great Ice Cream Scooper,"Makes a weird noise if you shake it, the handle got some gel material to conduct heat...which I am not sure if that really helps. But the teflon(?) coating on this scooper does an excellent job at scooping out ice cream and a quick rinse to clean."
5,Love my ice cream,"Hi to whomever is concerned about this product,This scoop is absolutely marvelous. Easy to grip, easy to load with my favorite desert and cleans like a dream. Very strong and stable in construction. Highly reccommend to any and all who take their ice cream serious. Am very happy with this product in every way."
3,Overrated,"This scoop is overrated. Other reviews say that it cuts through ice cream with ease, and I submit that it does not. It might be much better than your average cheapo scoop found at Walgreens, but I compared this side by side with my Tupperware scoop, and it's about the same. Do NOT buy this thinking, because of the non-stick surface and anti-freeze qualities, that it will cut through ice cream like butter. It does not. I'm wondering if maybe other people's freezers are set to higher temperatures than mine, maybe, and that's why I didn't see much of a difference."
1,Good scoop - until the coating peels off in a week,"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt I had to add to the growing rolls of people who are disappointed in this product.The first time I used the scoop, it worked great - I was impressed by how easily I was able to scoop out hard ice cream. Unfortunately, after a couple of uses and associated washings, I noticed that the non-stick coating was starting to flake off of the scoop.Like other users, I only hand-wash the scoop, so my handling isn't the cause for the peeling. I really wanted to like this scoop, and, until it started peeling, it was great. Yeah, it wasn't expensive, but it still should have lasted more than a couple of weeks..."
2,Not Dishwasher Safe,"I did read that the scoop should not be exposed to more than 140 degree water. I did not think my dishwasher got up to that temp, but it must have, because after about 25 uses the teflon coating started to bubble up and come off. It did work great before the coating came loose. Guess it would hold up longer if you hand washed it."
5,Awesome!,"This is a wonderful little product! I eat ice-cream a lot, and my boyfriend finally got tired of me digging into a tub with a spoon and flinging loose pieces around. He bought me this for Christmas and it's made scooping ice-cream mostly effortless. Very sturdy and the anti-freeze is such a great idea. The ice-cream in the scoop just glides off into the cup/bowl. Easy to clean up as well. Works best on slightly softened ice-cream (not frozen solid...). We love it! I even bought one for his mom to share the joy :)"
5,Scoop Review,"I bought this for a Xmas gift for my folks because they always complain that the ice cream sticks to their scoop so I decided to give this one a try based on positive reviews. Happy to announce that this thing really works as advertised. Scoops hard ice cream with ease and doesn't stick to the scoop, what more could you ask for."
2,Ice Cream Scooper Disappointment,"Really loved this scooper when we first got it. Scooped ice cream really well, however over time the non-stick coating is peeling off. What a disappointment. Would not recommend this product, feel like it is not safe to use."
4,Works better than a traditional ice cream scoop,"The blade edge of this scoop works well to get the ice cream out, and much better than a normal ice cream scoop. I'm not sure how much the anti-freeze in the handle helps, and personally I'd rather it not be there at all. I would imagine you would have to be scooping a lot of ice cream to see a benefit with that feature.A quick run under hot water from the faucet lets this scoop slide through your ice cream, making perfect scoops.Simplistic, effective, and no moving parts."
1,The non stick coating chips off after 10 uses,"Usually the highest rated item is a great pick. I've had not-up-to-expectation products in the past but never a disappointment like this one. Sure it was affordable, but after only about 10 uses, within 2 months of getting it, the black non stick coating in the scoop section started chipping off. I just rub it with my finger and more keeps peeling off. To avoid digestion, I've thrown away the item. It's never been dishwashered as I only use the ""soft"" side of the sponge to hand wash this baby. Just wanted to let folks know what risks they are dealing with in picking this up. I'm going to shop around for a metal one starting today."
1,you get what you pay for.....,this scoop stinks. i've had it for 6 months. the nonstick doesn't stick. it comes off. this is going into the garbage and i'll get one that doesn't have non stick.
2,Disappointed,"This item works well, but the non-stick coating is chipping off all around the edge of the scoop. I have taken good care of the scoop, and have always hand-washed it. It should be in much better condition than it is now."
4,One more scoop,"I like my ice cream pretty frozen solid, so found this scoop. The nonstick works great. However the anti freeze liquid is NOT going to warm up right away as soon as you start scooping. But with just a little effort the ice cream will just slide right off into your favorite bowl."
1,"Itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny and downright embarrassing","These stones are miniscule, teeny-weeny cheap-looking things. Much too small for a teenager or adult. The photo on the website is deceptive. The backing may actually be larger than the stone. Planned to present them as a gift, but would be embarrassed to give them to anyone. They are so tiny, they'd be lost in a jewelry box. Back they go to Amazon. Lots of trouble and expense for something so trivial."
1,Was Happy with there look,I was very happy with the look of these ear rings BUT one of the clasps was laying insde the jewelry box and would not work i.m sure Amazon is not to blame but it was like some one had opened these before I did.
3,meh...so so,"These were nice, but VERY small, but hey you get what you pay for.Nice for babies, but not so much for adults....."
2,Technical Book,This book has a lot of information about the bone construction of dogs who have a genetic defect causing them to not perform according to the purpose of why they were bred. Unless you are going to be a judge at a dog show skip this book. It is pricey for what it contains.
5,A must for those with giant breeds,I own the origional 1973 edition of this book and was delighted to find it has been put back into print. I found this book invaluable when I was fist beginning to show dogs. It was a great help in understanding what I was seeing in the show rings and the why of that movement. I feel anyone who wants to show dogs would benefit from this book. I have loaned my personal copy to many people new to the show rings and all of them have said it was very helpful.Visual aids when looking at gaits are a must. These are well done and the text is easy to understand. I really like the drawings and think they are the key to what makes this book so great for the begining handler or breeder. Even though I have been in the Dog Fancy for over 30 years I still take it out and look occassionally!
4,Different!!,these are nice cufflinks. i thought they were a little bit smaller than what they really are. They look good on white dress shirt
3,WEAK,"I couldn't wait to watch this one, his first dvd recorded live in Canada. Some great songs and some were well done, a fair band not great. Some songs Bryan just stood there singing with his guitar, but he did not play it most of the time. He does not do to many solos either, after awhile I started getting bored. Nothing to draw you in much I guess, the best word for it is kinda flat. The dvd is not real bad, but not real great either."
5,Bryan In Montreal,This is a great live blues DVD. I like the camera work and the sound quality. Bryan and his band are smokin'.
4,good time blues,"His playing won't really stand comparison with Johnny Winter or Robin Trower but he's got a great voice for blues. And his songs really turn the Montreal crowd into a party. The backing guitarist plays almost all the rhythm parts but Bryan does play several interesting solos. Even though I heard one too many ""merci beaucoup""s it's obvious Bryan Lee and his audience are having a great time. The 20 min. interview tells a lot about this artist who I'd never heard of before he appeared with Kenny Wayne Shepherd on the Tonite show back in February."
4,First Bryan Lee,"I thought the dvd was very good. The only drawback was the drums or drummer was too far forward in the overall music. In other words, the drummer was in the center channel with Bryan Lee's singing. I had to adjust the speakers to reduce the drums in order to listen to the vocals. Other than that the music and solos were recorded well and was very enjoyable seeing Bryan and his band play."
3,"Very ""out of the box""","I had the pleasure of reading this book prior to hearing Mr. Bishop speak at a recent conference. I must say he has some very interesting methods of sales.While this isn't a ""how to"" book, it gives several very interesting stories of how outside the box thinking can propel a product or service forward toward success. Everytime I pass a nightclub with a line, I think ""I wonder if they read this book?""If you are a small business owner, I would recommend this book. If you are a salesman that has little control over how to market and present your product or service, then I would skip this and go toward something a little more technical."
5,A sweet adoption story.,"This is a lovely adoption story for children from China or other Asian countries. The story begins with a young preschooler enjoying cookie making time with her grandmother. But as she makes cookies representing her family, as children do, she is feeling sad because she looks different than the other people in her family. Her grandmother lovingly takes her into her lap and retells the story of Emma's adoption from China. Most of the book is about her adoption and journey home, with the joy that this brings to her family. It has a loving ending, where she plays in the park with her family and knows sometime she will return to China to visit. Song Nan Zhans's colorful illustrations illuminate the story with warmth."
3,Too Easy!,I like puzzles with a little challenge to them...somehow even the more challenging Jumbles that were supposed to be toward the back were too easy for me! I hate solving the main puzzle before I get the words unscrambled!
4,I think its a great tool,It works but I think it would work better on people that have BIG blackheads.
1,Disappointed and concerned,"There was a definite chemical smell when taken from the packaging that all the airing out in the world would not remove. To make matters worse, the bear seems to have extreme fur loss problems. After unwrapping this gift for my children I immediately had to take it away as huge patches of synthetic fur were being shed everywhere, just petting the head my daughter's hand was caked in fur. The bear is adorable and my kids absolutely loved the look of their new floor mat but between the persistent chemical smell, which is really concerning, and the chunks of hair which are now all over my house even after removing the rug... I recommend looking for another product. I really wanted to enjoy this item and was sorry that we couldn't."
4,Cute,"Overall this Grizzly bear throw is really cute! The only comment I have is that the body could be ""filled"" a little more. Otherwise, just adorable!"
3,Not as good as Ray Chen's book,"It's nice to know there is more than one book that attempts to capture the beauty of Jamaica from a non tourist point of view. I also give this woman kudos for having the courage to share her art. However, this work doesn't come close to Ray Chen's representation of Jamaica and it's people, which is unfortunate since Chen's book was done in the 70's. Anyway, there are some photos in this book that are blurry when they didn't need to be so. It seemed more like bad production than an artistic choice. It was disappointing, as I too have a passion for photography. Maybe for those who just want to get a sense of the country this book will suffice. Certainly isn't horrible, but it sure could be better."
4,A Welcome Addition to the Literature of Haiku,"This is a welcome new addition to the literature of haiku for those interested in this poetic form., written by the African-American writer, Richard Wright, Unfortunately, the Afterward, in trying to explain the underlying Zen roots of the haiku form makes some serious mistatements about Zen philosophy."
4,Wished it was a bit longer,Truly an unusual hero. A nice tale regarding the conversion of a really detestable individual to a man of conscience.
4,A lovely story,"This story was great to read. At first I thought how can she marry and not know the man but the story is so well developed, you totally get how that could happen. The characters were very likable and the situation was such that you so want the happy ending for every one involved in the book and you are not dissapointed. Lovely for an easy, entertaining read."
4,A nice story of love changing lives,"Love changed both the lives of the hero and his intended lady. I love this author. This was written with humor, and enough twists to keep it interesting. It was fun to read of a ""bad guy"" in one book and then watch as he became a great guy in the next book. The romance was sweet but not taken beyond a few wonderful kisses. I don't want to give the story away, but let me just say that I enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone. It is a book I will keep. I'm going to look for more books by this author.There were many typos with quotation marks and some wrong word choices. Maybe the editor was a bit too fast with spell checker? Still it was worth reading!"
4,It was a gift,"My granddaughter was happy with it, and if fit her purpose. I have seen her wear it, layered with her favorite top."
4,very good,"this was a very good book. i didnt really like the girl's character, jamal's girlfriend i forget her name, i didnt really like her at all. but this book is one of my favorites. i would read it over again if i had it and didnt let an associate borrow it. very nice!"
5,review of spanish-english dictionary,"The book came fast, in good shape and saved me from having to drive to the mall. It's the best dictionary of it's type I know of. It lists every word I've ever needed to speak spanish It's little and very convenient to use because the words are in blue and the translations in black. I've used it for 7 years for myself to speak w/ my latino gardner and now I've bought the second copy for him to use to learn english better."
5,The legends of yesteryear,"This is an amazing book. I wasn't so much interested in the life of Harry Traver, but the legendary coasters he built. Too bad there aren't any of them around today. I have heard the stories of the great rides they were and my grandparents actually got to ride the legendary Crystal Beach Cyclone. A fabulous peek at the great coasters of days gone by."
4,Liked it but the motor noise was too loud,I wanted a camcorder to replace my old Sony Hi8 TR81 which I loved. Stuck with Digital8 for compatibility. The TRV350 has a lot of great features for the price but I thought the motor noise was too loud. The TR81 didn't make much noise at all. When viewing tapes you can hear the motor. Just didn't think it was acceptable so I returned it. Went to the JVC GRD70 and MiniDV. Returned as well. Read review.
4,bit noisy,"This is a great camera but it can be noisy - I had to return the first one because it was really really noisy. The one that replaced it was better, but still way noisier than my old Sony Hi8 which was downright silent. I guess the tape moves twice as fast and the heads probably spin faster too. Anyway, considering that the Hi8 was $1400 in 1992, this is a good deal as it has a bunch of things I wanted then like a built in light and the LCD display.There's a fine line between ""noticeable"" and ""annoying"" noise levels and this one is right up against it. As I understand it lots of the new digital cameras, including the DV format cameras are noisier than the older analog models, I guess unless you start spending more than a grand or so. Oh well. 4/5 stars."
5,Review of Yana Electronics,Ordered a dcrtrv350 camera from Yana Electronics. Service was prompt and excellant.Peter was very helpful and did more than was even needed to make purchase work. Iwould highly recommend to order anything from Yana they provide a great product andback up their service 100%!!!
3,Disappointed with this Sony,"I had high expectations for this camcorder,but they were dashed with poor indoor nightime recording with ample lighting. My previous cheap Sharp model aced indoor shots at night. The Sony has to be ""tweaked"" for every nightime indoor video. I just want to ""auto"" record sometime. The light is also useless. No hot shoe either. Also.it won't play back all of my older 8mm tapes. It seems to be unforgiving if they were recorded on a non-sony model or a model with dirty heads(the Sharp could though). I think it's a good camcorder if you don't expect too much from it."
1,NOT HAPPY,"FOR THE LIFE OF ME I COULD NOT FIGGER OUT HOWTA UZE THIS CAMRA!I SPENT MY ENTIRE WEEKS VACATION TRYIN TO GETTA VIDEO OF OUR CABIN IN THE WOODS BUT NUTTHIN DOIN! I COULDNT EVEN FIGGER OUT WHERE TO TURN THE DANG THING ON! IT DONT COME LOADED WIT FILM SOTHAT IS ANOTHER BAD THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT IT, I THINK YOU SSHOULD GET THE THING READDY TO FILM FOR THE MONEY YOU PAY!I AM GOIN BACK TO MY TRUSTY SUPER 8!"
3,not as loud as you would think it should be.,"Installation is a not as easy as just replacing your old horn. Because it uses more power, to avoid blowing fuses, have to use included relay. Mounting bolt that comes with it is not very good solution to hold it in place. Vibration loosens it up over time. Wiring and relay got to be hidden from elements and out of sight. That was one of the most challenging things for me and I ended up making custom electrical box to hide the relay.After all the trouble, I was really disappointed with performance. Used it few times and took it off.Not worth the trouble in my opinion."
3,"It's ok, but not that loud","I bought it to replace the horn on my SUV. The stock horn on the SUV was louder. I considered using it in conjunction with the existing horn, but this horn is too high pitched for my tastes."
5,Excellent For Your Motorcycle,"I have owned a Stebel Nautilus Air Horn before, They are good quality and reliable as well. Had it on my motorcycle and loved it! It was very loud, perfect for alerting all those dumb ass drivers. It was also a lot of fun to honk at the neighborhood kids for a good scare as well. Got a new motorcycle so its time for another one of these horns :) I strongly recommend this horn for all motorcycle riders."
2,Scare'em Outta Your Way,"The Nautilus Air Horn can wake the dead. My friend says he had ear ringing for two days after I blasted it in the garage (not recommended) but who could resist. You really need the wiring kit, unless you just like buying and cutting wiring as a hobby. The horn is large and pretty ugly, so get the black one. I still didn't have a hard time finding a place for it on my Triumph Bonneville T-100. Now we aren't stuck with that little ineffective ""beep-beep"" horn that wouldn't make a cat take notice. Just don't overuse it!Here's an update-the horn died on me after one week! Now it just makes a whimpering sound that makes you want to buy another! So I did at the reduced price of $30-hope the first failure was just a fluke. I really like the sound-but come on..they've got to last a while!"
5,Love this horn!,I was a little skeptical at first but after installing I was impressed. The sound is very loud and definitely gets your attention. The stock horn on my Mazda is a joke. I will install this horn on any future vehicles I purchase.
4,Compact air horn,"Wanted an air horn for my R 1150 GS. Several web articles recommended the Stebel Compact Air Horn. When it came it was marked as a Flosser, on the package and the horn itself. According to Flosser, it is the same horn. It took me half a day to mount it, due to the tight spot I put it in on my bike. It is loud, and so far I have been pleased with it. I probably should have ordered the wiring harness with it. It might have saved me some time."
5,You won't believe it,Awesome horn. My bike sounds like a semi-truck now. Easy installation but the only thing I didn't like is the way it mounts. With a little ingenuity you can get a good sturdy mount.
1,"This not a Stebel horn as pictured, its a Flosser. Its not 139 db as stated its 115 db","Recieved the horn. Box says Flosser, the horn has Flosser in big letters where its sposed to say Stebel as it does in the picture on Amazon. The box says its 115 db at two metres, not the 139 db its supposed to be. Came with no reciept so dont know if there will be a warranty. Would not have bought if it had been properly discribed, just another ripoff."
1,Very poor quality,Yep it was loud and it was easy to install on my 2008 Harley Road King. Problem was it was pretty much junk after only two seasons. Take my advice. Shop around and buy another horn that was build in North America with quality metal parts.
1,Loud... when it works.,"I bought this Stebel Nautilus air horn that took over 6 hours to install in my Honda F4i. It was because there was only one space that it would fit into that was difficult to get to. And after the motorcycle was reassembled and I left the shop, it worked for about 5 minutes...Now I have a dead horn stuck inside of my motorcycle since it would take hours to remove."
1,Poorly Written.,"While this book may have strong content, it is poorly written and VERY difficult to read. I hope that Cherrey and Allen do not use this approach to communicate with the students they serve. The text is so muddled it is maddening."
5,Paper Clips,These are great!Good price and they keep your papers together.i don't care for the other paper clips that do not have the vinyl on them (waste of money).
4,Just what you'd expect,Good quality. Good value as there are a lot for your money. Good colors. Unique for work. Fun to use.
2,Not durable enough,"I've not been ""lucky enough"" to have lost an item and had it recovered. I can say though that for any application where there is wear, these stickers just don't last. PDA in your pocket, forget it. In addition it is relatively awkward to register the stickers online, and the company makes little effort to keep the feedback loop closed (for example I would welcome a once a year email listing stickers and my address, verifying the protection is still active). Good idea, poor implementation."
4,Pop Punk,"Listened to this at the indie record store after it was recommended as something along the lines of New Pornographers, Shins and late 70s / early 80s UK Pop-Punk (Undertones, Nick Lowe, etc.). Very enjoyable and easily worth 4 stars, unfortunately the store already sold out of their few copies, so I'll have to wait until next time to pick it up. I only wish they would change their name a bit so searches would turn them up instead of dc Talk or Talk Talk or the other multitudes of bands with talk in their title."
1,Worst band ever,This is as un-original as it gets. There are millions of these bands around these days. It?s like a plague of mediocrity. But The Talk is by far the worst of them.
5,Hamonica Player,"One of the great Brasilian musicians,Mauricio Einhorn burrow of shining form in this CD. Highly recommended !"
4,Great if You have friends.,"Wayne Gretzky's 3D hockey is by far one of my favorite games for the N64. It's by no means a deep game, nor is it a game to play by yourself, but under the right circumstances, it truly shines. First off, do not buy this game and expect to do anything but play multiplayer. All I ever do in this game is play multiplayer. Modeled very closely with the Blitz series (over the top sports), the frantic action here actually works better than it did with blitz. With little interruptions of the action, you always feel as though the game is as quickly paced as possible. This feeling of frantic play leads to some very competitive moments. More often than not your games will end with one of your friends throwing something at you (mine have). Overall this game succeeds in the areas in which it tries to, and anyone expecting a deep experience is looking at the wrong game. This game knows where and when it does well and it sticks to it."
4,Wayne G. Hocky,"This game was 10x more fun when I was in high school. It was fun then and still somewhat fun now. I enjoy being able to reminisce about the good days when we knew hockey players for legacy rather than for necessity to their teams financial caps, this game was a benchmark on that process of integration and should be a staple of what is to come when it pertains to hockey games."
2,Needs lots of work,"This book seems to have passed through the editing stage without actually being edited. There are at least 4-5 typos in each chapter. It takes longer to figure out what the questions are asking than it does to actually do the questions. Whoever solved the problems and put answers in the back did the majority of them incorrectly, because the answers are wrong. In the chapters themselves, the wording is unclear and confusing. I would highly recommmend checking out other P-Chem books before purchasing this one."
2,No frills at THE BASE,"THE BASE is an overall average film. Clearly the actors' talents are not put to full use. Mark Dacascos' excellent martial arts skills are supressed to appear like a good street fighter, not the impressive military weapon he is suppose to portray. The story line is interesting, but is weakened by the poor ending of this action film. The good guy wins, but it is a dismal victory. The nudity added to The Base does not really flow with the story line. The director clearly failed in this film. The acting in this film is very good, but the camera angles were not. I'm sure the actors were disappointed with the final product. THE BASE is worth seeing once. I suggest renting versus buying."
4,Great fun!,Mr. Price has a good writing style that makes this book a joy to read. It will keep you interested from cover to cover. The only drawback is that he mixes documented ghost cases with folk tales and old legends with no clear pattern. As one who enjoys documented stories of ghost sightings I found this aspect of this book a bit annoying. Still the book is great fun and if Mr. Price was willing to put a little more work into research he could be one of the great American writers of ghost stories.
3,An eye on the ball,"I actually enjoyed this novel. But like other reviewers I found Willy to be unbearable and it was hard to see what her husband could love in her.After reading ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"", I have become used to Shriver's obsession with detail, which I had found unnerving in the beginning. There's something about her style that is truly riveting.I'm also interested in her penchant for male names (Willy, Lionel) for females, and her use of ""the eye"". To anyone who has read ""Kevin"", the eye reference here will be obvious. To see the ""eye"" theme again in ""Double Fault"" was disconcerting. Willy's therapist had a lazy wandering eye, that appears to emphasize his speech by its out of alignment movements. And then Willy has a run in with one of her husband's eyes ...I have another Shriver novel on hand to read. If there is any reference to people with only one operable eye in IT, I'll be REALLY spooked!"
1,No Thanks,"I liked Shriver's other book, ""We Need to Talk about Kevin,"" but this book, ""Double Fault"" whined on for too long. The protagonist, Willy, is despicable. Even though I was involved in the junior tennis scene and know all about rankings, etc., the loathesomeness of this character was beyond belief.I am not through reading Shriver forever; she is talented. I simply do not recommend this title."
5,"Great insights, terrific pace","This book has a lot of edge. It starts like an idyllic romanceand ends like film noir. The transition occurs gracefully -- throughpowerful writing, a well-crafted plot, and characters who act asugly (i.e., as human) as real people do. The guileless myth of thetrouble-free two-career marriage takes a beating, but it's abouttime. Shriver's choice of pro tennis as the arena for the couple'sprofessional rivalry leavens the story considerably, but also makesthe pain Shriver articulates more vivid by contrast. While theauthor's outlook may be grim, the story is constructive because itoffers a clear lesson. On the page, the tennis action is excitingand deftly conveyed, so the book reads easily. All in all, a verysuccessful union of literary novel and psychodrama. I highly recommend this book."
2,bitter taste,"Boy, I thought this was a bitter work. I liked some of her reviews in the Inquirer so I picked this up. Writing was almost callow. The author tries to marry the tennis world with a relationship tale and does not quite get the ball in the court, instead serving up a plodding story where her anger is manifest in her writing. I was disappointed."
2,Not too good,"I've been reading Shriver ever since I discovered ""We need to talk about Kevin"". Well, after Kevin this book is rather disappointing, so in a way I am glad it was written before because I can see how Shriver's work is getting better and better. Something about the story here was borderline preposterous. The husbands is too saintly. The wife too destructive. The love story too contrived. It just does not flow very logically."
1,"A big waste of time, money and the paper it's written on.","This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. Willy is one of the most unlikable characters I've run across and Eric comes off, alternately, as a wimp and a jerk. The other characters are not much better and I couldn't have cared less about any of them. I kept hoping the book would pick up at some point and so kept slogging through it. Big mistake. The only bigger mistake was spending 20 plus bucks on it in the first place. I would not recommend this book to anyone"
5,No Film Score Collection is Complete Without This Release,"The original ""Star Wars"" and ""Jaws"" by John Williams.""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"" by Bernard Herrmann.And Miklos Rozsa's monumental and most reverent score to ""Ben-Hur"" completes the quintet of the greatest examples of the art of scoring for film ever created.There is nothing more to say!"
5,Great CDs and movie booklet for a great movie!,"For film buffs, you will enjoy the booklet which includes a lot of background info and trivia on the making of this wonderful movie."
5,great,"It's just what I always wanted, you're perfectly right, it's just what I always wanted It's just what I always wanted, you're perfectly right, it's just what I always wantedlf"
1,"NOT, REPEAT,NOT LED","It is my fault, but I entered ""led rope light"" in search and this was the 2nd item listed. It is not LED! More energy and more mosquitos with these lights. No better then what I was trying to replace!1/12/13Rick"
5,Great lights are a great price!,"When I couldn't find clear rope lights at any of the local stores, like always I was able to find them here on Amazon. I am very happy with the quality of these rope lights. We used them to wrap around our square pillars in front of the house and they looked great. They were easy to connect together and stayed connected while being used. I would buy these again."
4,Rope lights,"I needed lights for an out door party. The Celebration Rope Lights fit the bill, I needed soft lights they were perfect for my party."
1,Celebration Customer Service Stinks,"I just set up these rope lights on my patio, I had purchased 3 sets from this seller, only 2 worked the third has a defect in the power cord and can't be fixed. I tried numberous times to contact the seller Celabration with no success. So my advise to any buyers don't wait so long to use them or at least check them before the return date ends!"
3,lights,bought 2 sets of rope lights 1st set great 2nd set never worked not worth sending back for the money
1,Half the lights died after 10 minutes...,"I bought these lights for a project at home. It took me a couple of weeks to get around to the project. I finished and it was great....for a while. After about a day of use (probably only 10 minutes total on the lights) half of the strand went out - a group of lights at each end. Since I waited to work on the project my time to return the lights expired, so now I'm stuck with a bunch of half-lit lights."
1,Not Worth The Plastic,"We received this 18' white rope light yesterday. For starters, the cord with the plug is much too short, only about a foot, if that. Secondly, we plugged it in yesterday afternoon at about 2:45pm, and by 4:15 this morning, two feet of the light had already malfunctioned. ""Out like a light"", one might say. We're returning this item."
2,ok lights,These lights were difficult to secure with the included hardware. The screws are so tiny that you need a very small driver and steady hand to be able to use them. I gave up and found other hardware. I was surprised and disappointed by the amount of heat produced by these tiny lights. Because of some basic shortcomings I only rate this 2 stars.
5,"If you're considering this DVD, get it!","Hi-5 is the best kept secret of children's shows. Unlike other shows made for kids that can be annoying, I actually ENJOY watching this. It is also far and away my 1 1/2 year old daughter's favorite show. As a matter of fact, it's the only show that actually holds her interest (which may be a good thing!). Since I can't sing, I have a big appreciation for those who can and these kids (in their 20's) are VERY, VERY talented! Plus, their songs are so catchy, I find myself singing them! We own the yellow DVD (volume 1) as well and they are both FANTASTIC! We have also ordered the newly released volume 3 and look forward to seeing Hi-5 in concert on August 2. I just can't say enough about them!"
5,Hi-5 Action Heroes,"My granddaughter (3yrs) loves Hi-5, and was delighted with this one. never took her eyes off the screen. I like them for their wholesomness. Seem like a nice bunch of kids."
5,Hi-5 is great!,"Well, my son L-O-V-E-S HI-5, this group has wonderful songs and they are great!.. I owned three of their D VD's already, and I will be buying the rest of the collection pretty son.. My son is 2 years and 6 months of age and he sings,dances and he uses lots of new words that he learned from the videos, and the music is so great that you will get involve with your kids while they are watching this wonderful video.."
4,Good Compilation,"If you watch the show (or rather your kids watch the show), then this is a good compilation of some of their better skits and songs. It's good for road trips, or bedtime."
5,great,My grandson loves the Move Your Body by Hi-5. The music is great and the messages it provides for children is great.
3,Fun but not as long....,"I expected to have more episodes available on this DVD, but it was not to be. The DVD include the themes from ""Under the Sea"", ""Action Heroes"" and ""T-E-A-M"" and an episode from each of the themes. I would have preferred more of the show, but I did like what I saw. The DVD also includes a few stickers and a ""travel case"" (rather than the typical DVD case)."
1,"Poor quality product, don't waste your money.","I purchased this product a little while ago and it died without much usage. There was no unusual handling or anything that would damage it. It just stopped working on it's own, while I was pressing the next song button. I contacted the company's support department and there was nothing that they would do for me. If I wanted to replace it I would have to pay almost as much as I did originally. It is clearly a poor quality product and won't last very long. High defect rate apparently. And the company exhibits no confidence in it. Bad experience."
4,History of Money,"A most comprehensive publication on primitive money. This volume examines the currency of Africa, Oceania, Asia, America and the West Indies, with a brief chapter on Europe, and a special chapter on cowries and beads. The text is thorough, the illustrations are good, and the photographs show hundreds of examples of primitive money."
3,Superior?,"3 stars = GoodThis was Henry Rollins' band on ""Nice,"" & another album that I can't recall at the moment. A kick butt capable band behind Rollins, but by their selves? There are some real butt kickers here, but overall the song writing just is not there, not that it is a bad album, but not just a great album.Stick with Mother Superior backing up Rollins. Can't speak for the other Mother Superior albums out there."
4,Should Be Required Reading for Politicians,It should be required reading for politicians and military leaders but especially politicians who get all our kids in harms way. Great book on the life of a great General regardless of which side you're on. It isnt politically correct but it does take you inside the mind of the guy behind the victory in Vietnam. As a vet of two tours in Nam with the Marines I found it fascinating to peer inside the strategy and the man. Great read.
3,Still some spotting,"The product generally works as advertised but.... If you do not dry the car after the special filtered rinse, you will still get some water spotting. Granted that is less than if you just hosed it off, but still some spotting. I would recommend that for best results, you let the car stand for 5 minutes after the final filtered rinse and them look for residual water on the surface and dry it off with either a chamois or microfiber cloth."
3,No too bad,"I have only used this item once and it seemed to work pretty good. If you decide to try to dry some of the car anyway, makes it pretty easy."
1,Not Good BUYER BEWARE,"This product is horrible, and don't get me wrong it is good the first few times you use it but prolonged use will cause damage to your car. After i used this about three times the fourth time cause peeling of paint on my hood and trunk lid and now I am in a battle with Mr. Clean to get my money back.BUYERS BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT"
4,great work!!,"I live in germany and my friend bring me the AutoDry to germany.I washed my black Tahoe in the sun..and IT WORKS!! GREAT!! But, you need a good water pressure, that the water is strong enough to wash the hard dirt away.Regards from GermanyTobias"
2,Produces Water Streaks instead of spots,"The cheap plastic water hose coupling that comes with this product failed after about 20 washes.The soap compartment leaks between washes. The only way I can prevent a puddle of soap from leaking onto the shelf is to empty the soap before storing the product.Rinsing the car with the filter turned on takes a long time since the filter reduces the amount of water coming out of the gun dramatically.It is 3 or 4 times quicker to use a drying cloth instead of the filtered water.I use this product to wash a black Mustang. Black does not forgive water spots or streaks.The water filters included in this kit say they are good for 3 washes. The replacement filters from Mr Clean say they are good for 10 washes. The filters that say 3 washes did not leave any water marks on my car. The filters that say 10 washes leave water streaks everywhere. If I could buy more of the original filters, I could overlook the other problems with this product."
1,Supplies DISCONTINUED For This Item,Don't buy this item. The supporting supplies have been discontinued by the manufacturer (P&G). It worked great too. What a shame.
1,pure crapola,"This, by far, is the worst piece of car cleaning aid that I have everpurchased. Save your money for a good bucket, sponges and a quality carwash such as Meguiars, etc. Finish up with a quality chamios and you'llstill be money ahead!~"
3,"good product, but buy it elsewhere","These sharpeners work fairly well on square carpenter's pencils, as well as standard pencils. But don't buy them at this inflated priced. I got the same sharpener at Home Depot for about $2."
5,Interesante adaptación,"Una interesante película para que los niños apredan el mensaje de la historia de Moises. Por supuesto que la adaptación es bastante gringa, pero el mensaje queda bastante claro."
5,Moe and the Big Exit,"Another great Veggietales, excellent work and a great learning experience for all kids."
2,Sorry to say I was disappointed,"I love the VeggieTale stories and could not wait for ""Moe and the Big Exit"" to come out, but this feature in no way compares to ""The Ballad of Little Joe"". Being one of the faithful watches of VeggieTales, this is the one video that my daughter will not sit through (and I have a hard time making it through). I guess we have come to expect great things from Big Ideas and with the great story of Moses we expected a lot more than we got. It is decent, but is at the bottom of the pile of my VeggieTales Collection."
2,Disappointed in the latest release,"Our daughter really enjoys VeggieTales, and we do too. Like any video series, there are going to be some that are better than others. This one fell flat from the child and adult perspective in our family. It was a bit over-narrated, especially compared to Little Joe (which we enjoyed) and the musical narration frankly got irritating by the end. It's too bad, because the story of Moses and the Exodus would seem to be a topic Big Idea could do great things with, but that didn't happen here."
1,Not for preschoolers!!,"I was very disappointed in this VeggieTales movie. These movies are supposedly targeted at young kids, but there was no warning that there was violence or disturbing images in this video. I realize this is simply a retelling of a biblical story, but some ideas really are not suitable for preschoolers. My 3 year old was very disturbed by babies being ""sent up the river"" to ""thin the herd."" The burning bush was also very disturbing to him. He actually asked me to turn it off!!! No more VeggieTales for us!"
5,Love Veggie Tales,Fast shipping. This movie is great! Watch The Ballad of Little Joe first though because they go together. Our son loved the movie.
1,How do I download?,"I purchased this selection on amazon.com expecting it to say something like ""Click to download."" I paid for it, but I can't download it.John"
3,Just looking for one song...,"As with previous MSG albums, I enjoyed the trip down memory lane. Was just looking for 'Anytime' as it brought back a special time for me. If you're a product of the 80's hair band craze, this is a must have for your collection...enjoy!"
5,Melodic metal,"Dating from 1989, Save Yourself was the second collaboration between Irish vocalist Robin McAuley and German guitarist Michael Schenker. As with the earlier MSG albums, the music was a blend of heavy guitar riffs and melodic vocal lines. The songs were a nice mix of hard rock and power ballads, but the songwriting was exceptional. Many of the songs featured engaging hooks and memorable melodies. The vocal harmonies, which showcased McAuley's higher voice, are almost a guilty pleasure. Most of the tracks were outstanding, although two (Bad Boys, and Get Down to Business) were a bit weaker. Arguably, this was the band's finest work. This edition includes several bonus tracks, including one unreleased song and two single edits. 4.5 stars."
3,scrambled Lyrics,Everything is good but the lyrics. It is not in order of the songs. It list the first two songs then skips to CD #2 14th song. Its all scrambled and its hard to sing along if you have to find the lyrics for the next song
4,Christian Music CD,Great music collection. Very up to date and still inspirational. Wonderful selections and artists that are well known. Really enjoyed it.Selection came well packaged and in great shape. No scratches and very secure in shipping. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
4,"""The Wicked"" Comes to Philly","It is incomprehensible why this cd is currently out-of-print. But fans of Pickett, Gamble and Huff, the Philly sound, or just awesome rocking soul music need to pick this up from one of the third-party sellers. It's a winner from start to finish.The record starts strong with a raucous version of ""Run Joey Run,"" moves into a groove with the minor hit ""Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You,"" rocks out on ""Get Me Back On Time, Engine Number 9"" and really never lets up. My favorite track is the Gamble-Huff nod to psychedelia, ""Bumble Bee (Sting Me),"" which sounds like it could have been an outtake from Electric Mud or Black Gladiator. Priceless.The bonus tracks add a few more versions of the hits, and an hilarious version of ""International Playboy."" I agree with the reviewer who notes that it clocks in pretty short, but it's a great ride while it lasts."
2,Didn't teach what I needed,"I do like the format of the lessons and how easy they are to get through. In my opinion, however, the most difficult part of learning Access is to understand the concept of building working relationships between databases. The few lessons addressing this topic were very brief and I feel basically chalked it up to being ""a difficult concept to master"" and left it at that. I would've preferred more instruction in this area, and less in how to enter data into a table.I will say, though, if you're just looking for a broad overview in how a database like Access functions, and how to work an already functional database, this is a good resource."
4,!Muy bien!,"If you thought that it was good in English, you should read it in Spanish! El cartero de Neruda or Ardiente paciencia. Very good!"
3,no title,"This novel is actually titled ""Homecomings"", as can be seen from the paperback editions, but I read a hardcover, so that is what I will review.I dunno, this series seems to be losing steam, but I can't quite put my finger on it. This one was definitely better than ""The New Men"", but not nearly as riveting as ""Time of Hope"", ""The Light and the Dark"", or ""The Masters"", to say nothing of ""The Conscience of the Rich"". I get the feeling that Snow has distanced himself more, is being rather more detached and objective. He had to bring his son near death for him to see into his nature and come to finally understand his core being. Wasn't there some other way? How autobiographical is this series? I would love to know. Still good, however."
3,B-movies,"I liked both a lot,girl missing was in pretty good shape,love Ben LyonIllicit was good movie,but it needs to be restored the copy they used is very roughto say the least,but this is a very old movie,the difference between movies madebetween 30 and 32,and movies made 33 and 34 is huge!"
4,Voyage through the issues surrounding the Columbia,"From Canadian wilderness to Longview smelters, the book introduces all the issues that embroil the Columbia: from hydropower to nuclear waste to logging to salmon to treaties.Unable to dwell too long on any particular issue, Cody doesn't try to draw specific conclusions from his journey. His focus on the geologic timescale of the river leaves the impression that time will smooth the ripples of human folly. The down-to-earth stories of the people he meets argues that although the collective results might have been foolish, the participants were/are hard-working, well-meaning, humans.Beyond politics then, Voyage does a wonderful job of stirring the restless energy to explore and experience that wells up from the constraints of two weeks of vacation a year"
1,Watch before buying,"Pure Country 2?! Someone should be made to lick the floor for even remotely relating this to the original Pure Country. It has nothing to do with the original movie.Let me tell you what this movie really is. It appears a movie company was desperate to make money. So they go grabbed an old film that was a hit and made a ""sequel"" to it. They got a hot girl, with a cheezy story, and tried to make a quick buck. George Strait did appear in the movie but mostly in small sections. He played a small role in the movie.At least some sequels try to relate to the original story line. This one had NOTHING to do with it! The only good part of the whole movie is that Katrina Elam is smoking hot. If you must have this movie, shop in the .99 racks somewhere. It will show up there soon!"
3,nothing exciting,some good music but not a very good story. i really did not enjoy it. i wouldnot waste my money on it again.
4,Teaches important values,"A movie the whole family can enjoy. Kids love horses and the music is great, too. Lifts the spirits of everyone."
2,Not exactly what I would call No. 2!,"Since this doesn't remotely resemble Pure Country, it was a disappointment to day the least! They could have at least made titled the film according to it's content."
5,Pure Country 2- The Gift,Great movie with uplifting ending!The music was very good.Overall just a clean feel good movie with a lot of pure country in it.
2,Pure country 2,This movie was not at all as good as I thought it would be. Don't waste your money. No where as good as the first.
5,Inviting Silence,"At first I was put off by the formatting of the text in the middle of the page, but finally fell into the rhythm of the words. This little book offered me the quiet wisdom I was hoping for. Keep it close to you, you'll want to read it often."
4,"Super cute, super functional!","The Haba line of pacifier chains are top notch! We've had 3 different types, and I'm impressed with each. One we've had for over a year and it's begun to stretch out a little bit. The clasp is not as tight but still works well. Occasionally, I'll pop these in the dishwasher if they need a deep clean. I have gotten so many compliments from these. I've even had to order a couple for other people. They look amazing. Note: some haba chains are short and some are long, make sure you check the dimensions!"
2,Doesn't hold up well,"We used this chain pretty heavily for about 3 months. However, after repeated washing, the wood has started to split and crack and it can no longer be used."
1,Do not buy,Waste of money. I couldn't even navigate the menu to get the dvd to start! Kept going in some sort of loop.If you are expecting a dvd full of interesting animated stories for your little one to enjoy then look for something else.
3,compilation of 11 mantras,This album is unique in that it's the only one of it's kind and it has a purpose- to ascertain the conceiving and birth of wiser healthier children. It is a compilation of 11 mantras from the Vedas especially for this purpose.
5,Great cd!!,It is hard to believe that the girl singing on this cd is only 11 years old. She sounds much older!My favorite songs are Work it out The promise and Can't stop thinking of you. Her remake of the journey song is pretty good too. The last song Easy to believe is also good but just doesnt seem to fit with her style.Tiffany Nicole is very very talented and i know she will be a huge star someday.
4,The Voice of an Angel,"For someone so young to have such a wonderful voice is amazing. The music is great, the vocals are nice, the writing is good. This girl is going places."
4,Perfect for my fly aways and somewhat frizzy hair!,"I really like using this product. My hair tends to frizz easily. If I wear my hair curly, I can put some of this on the ends and it makes my curls more ""in tact."" If I straighten my hair, I can put this on the ends to calm any frizzies or fly aways, too. I use a frizz serum on my wet hair and wait until it's dry to tame any leftovers with this product."
2,neverdone it by yourself author.,I must say that the writer has excelled very much in this book.The massage is clear and well understandable.
1,Not even worth looking at,"This has to be the [worst] excuse for a video game ever! Too bad it had to come in the form of a great character like Batman. The controls are unbelievably bad, so much as to say there is no control. This will definitely be the last game I get from Kemco. I can not believe I paid...bucks for this. Well, I see that only after 3 weeks of being on the market, the price has already come down... If there is anyone else out there curious enough to plunk down even a nickel for this game, you've been had!!! Horrible!!!!!!!"
1,Batfans beware,"Unlike a couple of other reviewers I actually have played this game.Nothing is good about this game. What a let down. Terrible control, terrible camera movement. It takes like one punch to bring down the bad guys. You want so bad to open doors and explore around you but Dark Tommorow doesnt let you do anything.everything about this game stinks."
1,A major dissapointment,"I have to admit, I was optimistic about this game, exicited even. I haven't played a good Batman game since....ever! Probably the most fun I've ever had with a Batman game was the driving portion of BatMan returns for the Sega CD, now that's sad. From the moment you press power on your GameCube you can tell things aren't going to be pretty. The CGI opening is decent, but I've seen better on PS1. Once the game starts you'll quickly become aware of the jaggey graphics and horrible camera. The camera is in a ""fixed"" position, much like Resident Evil. But the camera never lines up where it should, making jumping from one area to the next nothing more than a guess. The gameplay is awkward and frustrating making even the first level unusally hard and frustrating. Stay away from this game. If you're itching for a super hero adventure try Spider-Man the Movie, that game is a fine example of what a comic/movie game is all about."
1,its humanly impossible to enjoy this,dont get this game. the graphics are horrible. worse than sonic adventure. the gameplay is so bad. its virtaully nonexsistent. the control is the worst ever in a game. itll take you HOURS TO DAYS TO FIGURE OUT THE CONTROL. controls are so bad i felt nautious. the gagets were really really stupid and the combat looks like crap. this game cost a dollar. it is the worst game ive played in my life. (...) dont get this game. i had more fun twirling the cd then playing this horrible unfinished mess.
3,Buyer Beware!,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the game had a lot of potential to be the breakthrough Batman Game. It had a great storyline, but very poor character control. It took a few tries to perform some of the simplest tasks. He had a good arsenal of gadgets in his utility belt, which was a plus. But, overall, the game was very frustrating. Don't buy it unless you're a die-hard Batman fan."
3,Could have been so much better.,"Batman: Dark Tomorrow hs been in development for a long time. Now that it is out, I must say that I am disappointed. Camera angles are mostly bad, and the levels are frustrating.On the contrary, Batman does a lot of things right. Hand to hand combat is nice, and the graphics are good. Fans of the comic books can enjoy an all-new story, from DC Comics. The game is hard, so if you really need it, get a strategy guide.The game is just so disappointing. Too many levels feel pointless. Animation is awkward. Buy this game only if you are DIEING to see the new story."
1,"Holy terrible, Batman","Useless controls, erratic camera views, unclear objectives, and visuals so dark and poorly defined it's impossible to see even where you're facing. One of the worst games in years."
3,It was a excellent game but could of been better!!!,"The Game has excellent cinemas on the gamecube but not the xbox version because that was a port that became a disaster.I mean it,The Camera Angles may be screwy in this one and camera angles are good in the xbox version,so whats the different,supereasy controls -GC Horrible Controls -Xbox Camera Angles bad -GC Camera Angles good - xbox,so both has its faults but the best version would be the gamecube version."
4,Great Graphics Poor Ending,"This game is very challenging, with great graphics. However when you have mastered all encounters and come to the final conflict and win the battle you lose the war!!!"
5,Excuse me Mr. Amazon.com writer...,"My IQ is 174, and I liked this game. Don't blame people who like this game on Intelligence Quotient. It's rude, and it angers me. Thank you."
5,Painful and Mindboggling,"I found it gruesome to read the acts this young girl's mother gives. It's sad to see how some people hold things in until they explode. Even though at times this book was painful to read, my curiousity level on this book was at an all time high from the beginning until the end. This book was rather short, could have been longer...but even though it's short on pages, the reading level and maturity is another thing."
5,Bruises,"This book is about a girl whom gets beaten by her mother. Even though Judith doesn't do anything wrong her mother finds an ecuse to beat her. When Judith meets micheal, they become good friends. Micheal has secrets about his family too. Judith hates the fact that she can't tell Micheal the truth about her mother. She hates lying to Micheal. Micheal may just be he strength Judith is looking for.I enjoyed reading the book Bruises. It was a very interesting book. Every time you would think that you were going to lose interest in the book then it would catch your attention again. I like that at the end of every chapter it would end so that you would just want to keep readng. Each chapter ended with a mystery it ended so that you would want to know what happens next. i think that this book has a good message. The message is tht a good friend will stick by you no matter what happens."
5,the most amazing book,"I read the book ""Bruises"". This book was recommended to me by one of our libraians at school. This book will get you from tears to a smile. In the book a little girl named Judith . Judith has some darks secrets about her life it not so easy , she has hardly any friends at school . Everyday after school Judith has the responsiblity of picking up her little brother everyday after school, and before shcool she has to take him to the daycare.later on in the school year a new boy named Micheal . And he becomes Judiths new friend"
4,"Funky, but lacking...","I had waited for some type of cd compilation of Jimmy Castor Bunch's Atlantic material. I debated on whether or not to get it. I mean, it has ""Troglodyte"", ""It's Just Begun""...which were from his RCA period by the way. It has ""King Kong"", ""Bertha Butt Boogie"" and one of my favorite ever Funk jams, ""Potential"". My beef with this collection though, is where is ""Everything Is Beautiful To Me"" and ""A Groove Will Make You Move""? Is Atlantic releasing more of his material or is this it? Record companies really tick me off with their song selections on greatest hits albums. Hey Rhino, get in touch with me; I can put one together that's better."
3,OLDIES,IT WAS HARD TO FIND TROGLODYTE BUT I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GOT THE CD. IT SOUNDS JUST THE WAY I REMEMBER IT.
3,JIMMY ROCKS,Ihave always loved Jimmy castor i really grew up with his musicbut it been hard for me to find one of my favorite two albumsE-MAN GROVIN with that [awesome] song I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUwith that crying sax and EVERYTHING IS BEAUIFUL TO MESome need to print those up also
1,looking for jimmy castor song,I have an album (remember them?) lolo!!. Its called E-man Groovin.By jimmy castor bunch. On the album is this song called: EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL TO ME. It was a hit in the fall of 1976. I cant seem to find it on any of jimmy castor bunch's albums. is it out of print or what. does anybody know where i can find it on cd? i dont necessarily need the album. I really just want that particular song. I appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks!! Carl
2,like it.,"good. I'm trying to find a song by jimmy castor bunch, called the prince of darkness, it's a 70's deal, the only thing about the album I remember is he is sitting on a motor cycle, and I think the album cover is light brown or tan. If someone has this, or information about it, send only e-mail to TNT4EVR@MCHSI.COM"
5,Best Hi8 (or 8mm) camcorder,"Personally I think you should get a MiniDV digital camcorder. Namebrands like Sharp and JVC now have very inexpensive MiniDV models, so it's time to move to that format.If you really need an 8mm/Hi8 camcorder -- for example, in my case I needed one to play back my large library of 8mm tapes -- then this Sony is simply the best. It costs a bit more than a couple other Sony models as well as some offerings from lesser companies, but you get what you pay for. This Sony is not only high quality but has tons of features, such as image stabilization, NightShot, and 20x optical zoom. You can hook it up to your PC as well. You should also know that its CCD sensor is 460k pixels, more than any other model in this price range. The result is vibrant images."
4,A Small Step Below Digital,"The choice was pretty difficult. Either an entry level digital, or this higher-end Hi8 unit. I picked this one because I like the zoom, the night vision, and all the other great features I could not get in a digital at the same price. I also own an analog to digital box for my PC, so I can plug this Sony into my Firewire port anyway.The digital would have been nice, but I know I would have lusted after the bells and whistles after a while. This buys me a few years until the digitals improve and come down in price."
2,Repairs are costly,"I have owneds my CCDTRV318 for about 18 months and I think the camera has performed very well. Or, I did until I tried to use it at the first high school game this fall. It didn't work. The picture on the LCD screen and in the viewfinder was all blurry and distorted. I tried changing every setting and every adjustment I could think of. I couldn't fix it.So, I took it to the local Geek Squad and they sent it out for analysis. The result? Sony would have to replace the CCD and other gizmos for a total of $196! After 18 months.No, I did not buy warranties or anything - c'mon be serious.So my question: do I spend $200 for repairs? Do I buy a new camera for $300-$400? Should I buy a Sony ever again?I'm off to try to wrangle Sony customer support and perhaps will post the results of that wrangling here.EDIT UPDATE: Sony ended up fixing this for NO charge and now it works like a champ. If I could I'd change my review to 4 stars now."
4,ordered expecting it to work and it does,"finally found one for video conversion from tape to digital at a good price, now i just need to start the project"
1,Problems just out of the box!,"Problems just out of the box!1st camera we received did not charge the battery. We returned and got another one that after 5 months of storage and perhaps 2-3 hours of TOTAL use (recording time), it went back to ""Not charging the battery"" since it is out of warranty (30 days - Amazon will not exchange it) and under the (1 year Sony warranty), we called, they said the camera needs to be repaired and it is $166 plus shipping which is about $190, for a camera that we purchased for $260JUNK!!It is all I have to say about this camera, I got to use the camera for a total of 3 hours.I paid about $90/Hour to use this junk, went for the name brand and GOT Burned.I do not know why I was talked into buying a Sony it is overpriced and now the quality is JUNK, we have had Panasonic electronics all our lives, and they just get old and outdated, but they keep in working! Guess what my next camera will be? - Panasonic-"
1,Horrible for a restored product!!!,"I purchased this ""factory restored"" camera and it was very dissappointing! The focus is terrible. There are only two spots with the zoom that are actually in focus. Even when it is zoomed all the way out it is blurry. I just had my first child and I bought this to record his first years and because of this camera I have already missed recording two months! This was such a waste of money!!!!!"
3,Never go for Brand Name,I bought CCDTRV318 for about 18 months and the camera has performed very well. Just 2 weks ago suddenly it didn't work after 5 months of last use.The picture on the LCD screen and in the viewfinder was all blurry and distorted. The picture is getting clear little bit after half hour. I tried changing every setting and every adjustment I could think of. I couldn't fix it.I did not buy warranties so I don't know where to go and how much is going to repair.I bought canon Digital 8 camcorder 6 months ago to give present to my friend. Its working really nice. I think there is nothing in name brand. I would prefer small brand with warranties.
2,Twice burned,"My Daughter saved up for this camcorder for a long time, so it was a big deal when we finally picked up a new unit. The first unit was junk right out of the box as it would not play back on the lcd screen. I exchanged it for another unit which worked for less than 8 hours before it to quit. Very disappointed in the quality of this unit. I would imagine that I ran into a quality batch problem but it was a bummer and has caused me to have to reconsider going back to Sony for this next unit."
4,Not what I thought it was going to be.,"This is not actually a Nouvelle Vague album.While there are a couple of new tracks, the disk is primarily a collection of songs that inspired the Nouvelle Vague producers. This makes for an interesting mix, but maybe not what you were expecting or looking for."
1,poor quality and service,"The bed frame arrived damaged, and the seller (Homevisions)took forever (almost 5 weeks!!!) to provide return service and refund. The bed is made of cheap quality pressed wood - not worth the $139 it sells for."
3,"Fun Book, Poor Editing","It became obvious as I read that the current printing by wildside press was done by scanning a paper manuscript with poor Character Recognition, then it was printed without a final check. Lots of punctuation errors all over the book. The 'd' in the word 'and' was replaced with 'al' in at least two locations. (Write that out to see what the awful result is!) How a printer could ever get away with this is beyond me.If you want to read this fun little story, get a second-hand copy of the original printing."
5,Real life - positive & practical,"365 Days of Coaching is a great book because it is real. Rachelle takes a positive, common-sense approach to life that could be regarded as ""wisdom,"" if one buys into the theory that knowledge applied is wisdom. I enjoy the everyday examples she uses. Some of the exercises that Rachelle suggests are extremely helpful; I didn't do/try all of them. It was fun to look at the totality of the presentation in its book form; I've been a subscriber of the daily e-version for several years. I'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a daily infusion of positive, practical thinking. -- Mary Ellen Merrigan"
5,a different kind of book,"This is a refreshingly different kind of book dealing with the challenges and rewards that life offers. The time-honored wisdom is done in a unique way--bite-size chunks of info, easy to dip into but difficult to absorb in just a couple of sittings. The amount of usable ideas is vast and varied--a treasure chest of advice that is shockingly on target."
3,BOUGHT AS GIFT,Bought this for my wife who is a Pastor / Life Coach. Says it contains lots of good principles.
5,The Painted Garden A Year in Words and Watercolors,"This is a MUST have beautiful, as well as enchanting journal to read! I purchased it for two reasons. I have begun a watercolor class and this book is full of beautiful pictures. So I can try for some similar results after I practice, practice, practice. Secondly, after visiting Gloria, a friend with a georgeous flower garden, I want to start my own small flower garden. This book is full of names of flowers along with their pictures, so I can determine what I like most and where it will grow. Already my gardening and painting friend, Gloria has purchased this book after only glancing through my copy. Now I would like to purchase other titles by Mary Woodin. I have discovered she was also into ceramics, as I am into pottery, maybe we are kindred spirits."
2,MORE GARBAGE...,"All this is, is a series of videos that can be downloaded for much cheaper and in unedited versions. Don't get this as it is likely not what you are looking for. Not that I know what you are looking for, but if you are anything like me...you are looking for something that has honeys all over the place, dancin an doin they thang. If that is the case...this DVD is not for you. lol"
2,Applications& Investigations in Earth Science,"Book arrived as promised; used in decent condition. Upon using this week in class, it was noted that random pages are missing. Now I'm unable to return and I must purchase a new book. Not happy at all. This is my first bad experience and hopefully last!"
4,The Best of the Blues Brothers-Can You Dig It!,I loved this DVD. All kinds of stuff I have never seed. I loved the stories from the band. Great footage. I don't know why some people are so hard on this. I loved it and if you are a fan of the Blues Brothers you will love it too. Enjoy~I did and will again....
4,DVD contents,I really enjoyed the footage of the Blues Brothers and can not expand on the good points raised in the other reviews. A must for all fans. But where are the Harmonica instructions that are advertised? I did not find them. The DVD is still a must own.
2,Don't bother...,"Somebody must have recorded this from Saturday Night Live, low quality video & terrible audio. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. I've watched it twice & will give it to someone else."
3,Wonderful Cades Cove,"Good book, with great references. Everyone needs to go the 'Cove' just to see th beautiful scenery. But the history is wonderful and well written in this book."
5,Scholary book,"This book is more of a scholarly (textbook) read, but if you are serious about learning about the lost community of Cades Cove, this book is a must. I have other texts concerning the history of the Cove and I frequently cross-check the facts. They all match up. Dunn has definitely done his research on the subject!"
1,Where was the editor?,This is the most grindlingly boring book I have ever encountered. Had I not been on a very long trip and not utilizing the audio version I would not have been able to finish it. Mr. Ford deperately needs a good editor.Sharon Chamberlain
1,unbearable,"the only thing more tiresome than Ford's recent, drainingly boring novels, including this unbearable new one, is the studied, saturnine expression in all of his photos. it makes you want to shake some life into the man's books, and the man."
2,Why?,"The whole trilogy went on in Frank's head and even the author say's he does not write ""characters"". So even though much of it is witty and insightful, It was like reading being privy to someone's thinking, with no real action or relationships. His marriages are between the books as is much of his child rearing. New Jersey real-estate aside, I found these books a stunt. The books are always set in a couple days before a holiday with the hero ruminating over his life and his interactions with incidental characters rather than those most important to him. Maybe I don't get what the author is doing, or maybe I just don't like it. Plenty of other people do though as he is ""award"" winning and prolific..."
1,Endless descriptions of driving,"I loved Independence Day and really looked forward to The Lay of The Land. I cannot get past page 50. It's criminally boring, with long, long descriptions in intimate detail of a drive in the car. No detail is to small. It's very quickly monotonous and I found myself skimming. That's a good sign to give up on a book."
3,Character-Driven,"If you like to get in a book that is plot-driven, you probably want to steer clear of this book. Not a lot happens, in other words. If, on the other hand, you enjoy a character-driven book, then you might enjoy riding shotgun with Frank Bascombe through that State of Confusion known as the ""Garden State.""Ford is at the top of his game as a writer. The tone is conversational, the asides often funny, and the observations about our times insightful. Still, unless you've read Frankly before, you might be asking, along about p. 100, ""What's it all about, Alfie?"" (OK, Franky.) No matter how wonderful the writing or how deep the character, at some point all except for the most patient of readers will cry, ""My kingdom for a plot!"""
5,Lays Out the Later Life,"I'm hugely enjoying this sprawling, cleverly-written book. In some ways it reminds me of ""Ulysses,"" in its restricted but minutely examined time period. There are even a couple of bar scenes. The author is not a New Jerseyite but seems to me to have gotten the flavor of the millenial year and the scene quite well. As one who is in his ""fourth quartile,"" I can relate to Frank Bascombe's angst and his feeling of purposelessness. Ford has a marvelous vocabulary and obviously enjoys wordplay."
2,What a disappointment...,"I couldn't wait to read this book. The Sportswriter was sublime, Independence Day magnificent. But this book was a huge bore. I can't believe anyone could care about these characters who didn't read the first two books; that's the only reason I slogged through it, hoping it would get better and start to feel profound and consequential, as it should have. I feel betrayed by the author, the publisher, and all those reviewers, including the The New York Times, who proclaimed it one of the best books of this year. Perhaps they were just happy to read a bash of the President and evil Republicans every predictable 25 pages or so, done so gratuitously that it's shocking Ford wasn't more clever about it. Frank Bascombe fans, steer clear if you want to keep your warm feelings about him!"
1,Lay of the land opinion,"I did not like this book because the author seems to be introducing the book throughout the book. He never seems to get into a story. The book is generally very negative about life. If you like gloom, this book is for you.He is constantly mentioning political sides and beating on one particular side. It's ok to do this once or twice, but not constantly. The main ""almost story"" is not about politics.I do not recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","Ford is a master of the internal dialogue, but he went too far in this snoozer. I had to close it for good only halfway through this aimless book. A real snoozer about east-coast elite in New Jersey, of all places."
2,Disappointing novel,"The novel is depressive, melancholic and has only a few interesting chapters. Not Ford's best work, possibly his worst. The story of a ruminative, aging divorcee that is abandoned by his 2nd wife and isrecovering from prostate cancer. Not entertaining."
2,"""shut up and write""",I looked forward to reading a book about realtors but the mood was ruined on one of the first few pages when the author has the principle character call our president a numbskull. Why an artist would purposely alienate 50% of his readers with a offensive comment that has no connection to the story is beyond me. I am not sure I will even finish this book?
1,"monotonous, bromidic, disappointing","This is not the Richard Ford of The Sportswriter, much less Independence Day; the intervening two decades must have taken a terrible toll on this author. I found two chapters with dialogue sufficient to engage my interest. The balance of this novel is filled with so much meaningless, monotonously descriptive narrative that I began to suspect I was reading a New Jersey travel brochure. I want a refund. I deserve a refund."
3,I'm sorry Richard,"Richard Ford is my favorite author. I've also heard him speak and he is one of the most profound speakers I've ever encountered. I truly love the way he captures the human condition in his characters - we meet them at some crucial juncture and follow them through to its conclusion. He reveals the inner workings of a complex mind, the way we ourselves see and feel life.But this book didn't hold my attention. I really did try. I struggled to trudge through the pages. I know this character and wanted to want to read the book, but I struggled. Then...really weird...I set it down in the Las Vegas airport and forgot it. Walked away. What's that about? Anyway, I couldn't bring myself to buy another copy.Sorry Richard, I love your work and I'm hoping the next one is better."
1,"Oh no, more middle-aged American Angst","Another dreary, depressing and predictable depiction of the middle-aged American male mind. It's all been done before by Mailer, Roth, Updike, Heller, Bellow etc. and doesn't get any better. How anyone can bear to read this stuff is beyond me.I foolishly thought there might be something different this time round but no there wasn't. The same pathetic whinge about modern life, impotence, George W. Bush and families, masquerading as a novel.Unlikely, unlikable and unbelievable characters - including a Tibetan real estate broker, a nympho southerner who speaks with a molasses accent and the good old Joe Sixpack narrator tells us what life is all about if you are a middle-aged failure coping with cancer.Oh for Anne Tyler!"
1,Don't bother,"15 members of our book club tried to read this book and I was the only one who finished it. Every dull, boring meandering page. Followed no theme, outline, was just a nice bunch of typing. Has great descriptions in places, but no one line of thought was followed through out the book. Characters were introduced an then abandoned, and the characters that were consistent were never ""fleshed out."""
1,Best and Worst of Worlds,"Here is a book to love and to hate. There are moments when I wanted to throw it across the room, endless passages of soporific detail about driving directions, for example, or far worse, a set piece in the middle of the book that is an exact retread of the central incident of the second volume of this trilogy and which should have come with a warning: if you read ""Independence Day,"" skip the next 75 pages or you'll be swamped with deja vue. On the other hand, the ruminations on the Permanent Period and the finely drawn, lovingly ironic characterizations of many of the characters are illuminating, tender and memorable. In no way, however, is it at all fair to call this book one of the 10 best of the year, unless of course the editors at the New York Times, failing to read their own reviewer, based their votes on the first two novels of this series, not this one."
4,A wonderful writer,"Richard Ford's prose is first class. His descriptions evoke character and setting better than most any writer I've read. The thoughts of his protagonist remind us of similar thoughts and feelings we've had ourselves, and the characters and situations all ring true. It's a long book, and it takes some time to read, but it's the kind of book that always draws you back. In other words, a ""good read."""
3,Not very much alive,"With hindsight I wonder why I read this not so hot novel. It was reviewed in German papers as THE American novel of the year (last year?). Odd choice, much too provincial and petit bourgeois for that grand presumption.Ford may know New Jersey like the back of his hand, but the trouble is, he does not bring it to life for those who don't have that knowledge. Actually, he does his best, and successfully, to keep such interest low.Equally, he may be deeply into the working of the real estate world, but he does not bother pretending that there is an interesting world to be known.I should be able to relate to his Frank Bascombe for other reasons, like age, like health trouble, like family shenanigans, but there is a lack of connectivity. I do not feel addressed by Frank. He tells me little that interests me.Consequently, this is a boring book. I am sure it is not boring to the real estate subculture of New Jersey, but that is exactly my point."
5,Perfect Sax Stand,"Stand is very sturdy, folds up easily and very compact, so great for travel. Sax looks like a piece of art on the stand, so doesn't take away from the beauty of the instrumnet."
4,Great price on a good stand,"My stand was delivered in about a week; it was well packed and came with a one page product description sheet. It's compact, well built, sturdy and padded to protect the finish of the horn. The stand is adjustable and folds up for travel. It's very convenient and holds my tenor securely while I set up my reed, mouthpiece, and neck. For $18 I think this is a great buy."
5,Well written biography,"This book was a gift to a relative. However I first read my copy 30 years ago. I must admit to a bias for the subject. John T. Lewis, a man of God was also my great uncle (brother of my Grandmother) whom I never had the fortune to meet except through the pages of this book."
4,great southern rock,"This is a good album by a good band. Black Oak has got to be one of the best and unique sounding southern rock bands ever. They combine elements of rock, country and boogie together. The singer is one of a kind, you either love his voice or hate it there is no in between. It's scratchy with a little southern flavor thrown in. Anyways on with this album. It has great rock /boogie tracks like swimming in quicksand, mad man, jim dandy and red hot lovin. It also has a couple of nice country sounding songs like back to the land and high an' dry. Overall this is a good cd so if you like southern rock you will surely like these guys."
4,Good early seventies rockabilly.Amazing voice range by J.D.,Excellent example of early seventies rockabilly. Voice range by Jim Dandy makes Black Oak a fun band to listen to. Of course they were a fun band to watch also. They epitimized the hard (although self induced) lifestyle of bands of that era.
4,"Love Raunch Rock, gutteral, primal rock? It's here!","Like all Black Oak Arkansas, this is raw rock, pure, harsh, crude, and if this doesn't move you, you need the attitude adjustment that BOA provides! WhEeeha!"
1,This is as bad as it gets.,"This is, without a doubt, one of the WORST records of the 70's. In fact, it's one of the worst records of all time. BOA has three (count 'em THREE!) guitarists which, taken together, don't even add up to ONE good one. That fact, combined with the worst vocalist in the history of rock, makes for some of the most wretched music ever made.And that is that."
3,In support of Brenda X,"What a great contribution Poco have made over the years to music.While some of their albums have been patchy, the highs have been up there in the stars. These two albums were average on balance but I have to come out in support of the song Brenda X, mercilessly panned by a former reviewer. I love Paul Cotton's work and this track is straight from the heart, a real goose-bump ride. The rural metaphor is superb in this ode to true love. And the music . . . I just love that backgroud synthesiserthat frames this minor key all American opus. It sends chills down my spine. Right down here in the South Pacific, that song lives. Straight out of heaven . . ."
1,Put this horse out to pasture!!!,"Poco's career highlights include some of the finest albums released in the country-rock genre. These two are not among them. The band had run out of steam by this point, and these discs - especially INAMORATA - represent feeble efforts to gain AOR pop stardom. The few bright spots here are included on the ULTIMATE COLLECTION. You can sleep well without wasting $100 or more on a copy of this turkey. There's a reason this one's out of print!"
5,Help can be found if you really want it.,I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for many years and am on medication. This book has helped me understand some of the aspects of what triggers anxiety and the choice I can make to control my responses. A person of faith will highly regard this book. The applications can be useful for every day stress that causes anxiety and mild depresseion that everyone is subject to.
3,Marginally Helpful,"I read this way back when it first came out many years ago. Even as a Christian who does not suffer from depression, I found it preachy and somewhat simplistic.People come to faith in Christ, and understandably expect that new relationship with God will go a long way towards alleviating any emotional pain they are carrying around. When the anticipated relief sometimes fails to manifest itself, however, they begin to think their must be something wrong with them - or with Christianity itself. It is a shame.The above-referenced problem is compounded by certain self-help books which often imply that all you have to do is obey God, go to church, and read the Bible and your problems will begin to melt away. If only the Christian life were that simple."
2,incredibly biased.,"This book has some good information. However it clearly has an overt agenda to convert the reader to Christianity. Pretty much has a quote from the Bible every other paragraph. If you are Christian then you may enjoy this. The authors' overall message is ""if you're not Christian then you will.be depressed"". If I wanted to read the Bible then I would,"
3,Not as good as their other one,"I got this book because the authors' ""Love is a Choice"" is SO amazing. This one was okay. Definitely buy the other one."
1,Give me a break!,"If I had known this book was the bible-thumper's guide to depression, I would never have purchased it. If I wanted a preacher and a sermon, I would have gone to church. If I had to count how many times the authors said GOD, it would take me weeks. Also, I don't believe in blaming all of your emotional problems on your childhood or the way your parents raised you. But the authors seem to think that if you are depressed, your parents must have done something wrong. Giving this book one star was being generous."
5,Life Changing Book (for Those Who Follow its Concepts),"I purchased this book for a friend. I read it years ago and it changed my life. By following the principles in the book I was able to get off the emotional roller-coaster that I had been on for years. I gave my original copy to a friend and purchased the latest copy for another friend. Well worth reading, in my opinion!"
2,"I didn't much enjoy reading this very short book, but it wasn't a waste of time","It's very odd, and while one does learn a great deal about the subject - Peter Handke's mother - there's a lot of quasi-literary-theory here that one has to plow through with, if you're anything like me, limited understanding. Somewhere on the promotional material printed on the book itself ""A Sorry Beyond Dreams"" is said to be his ""masterpiece"". I suspect that's certainly an exaggeration.I'm inclined to call out the author of ""Bread of Shame"" suggesting she maybe should be a little ashamed at trying to drum up interest in her book by writing a response, generally flattering, to just about every review entered. Find a better way. This method comes off as pretty insincere, whether I'm mistaken in your motives or not."
2,A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,"Though this purports to be a ""holocaust"" story, it is a biography of a woman (the writer's mother) who lived during that time but only slightly refers to the events of that period and their impact. It's more of ""50's"" women's story - the tamped down emotions, the ""other-directedness"" of the personality. This is mildly interesting but he is straddling his fence as a writer. It is his mother so he is backing off the subject, trying to be objective, but in doing so only gives us broad hints of the real problems in her life. Had it been tied more strongly to specifics of living through the holocaust as an average German woman, it would have had more to say about the mind of that time and how a woman came through that time and on to the rest of her life."
5,Best Ever,"This phone works exactly as advertised, no problems with volume or clarity. Lots of excellent features and easy to use. And if you bother to read the instruction booklet, it tells you exactly how to add a 1 to numbers in caller id if necessary."
3,"Great phone and features, beware buying refurbished","I bought one of these phone that was factory refurbished and I really liked the features and performance. Unfortunately, almost six months to the day after receiving it the phone died. At first I thought that there was a problem with the phone line because the phone would ring once and stop. Picking up any phone in the house resulted in no dial tone. Since the DSL was still functioning I suspected that it was one of the phones and it turned out to be the EP5995 base station that was causing the problem. Factory new this is probably a five star phone but because of my experience with the refurbished model I'm giving it only three."
2,Will it last?,"I love the phone and all of its functions. Great speaker phone, adjustable volume. Just fell in love with it .....until at six months the handset quit working, then at one year and two weeks the base quit. Its two weeks out of warrantee so I am out of luck. ATT, great features, but unreliable. You should find a different brand."
4,No better range than my 2.4GHz phone but great features,"I am disappointed that the range we have with this new 5.8GHz phone is no better than the 2.4 it replaced. BUT we are still very pleased with it and would recommend it. The answering machine works well and the overall sound quality of the whole unit is very good. The extension phone I also purchased works well but, in my view, is significantly overpriced as compared to the base unit/answering machine. A clever marketing ploy, much like expensive ink cartridges for inexpensive printers."
2,This phone is trouble,"I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine. I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down. I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million. Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.Very poor sound/voice quality. It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel. I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever. Needless to say, I took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord. Sometimes you don't get what you pay for."
4,Good inexpensive phone set.,"Basically the title says it all. But I have to write a minimum number of words, so . . . Mice or some kind of little critters must have chewed up our phone wire to the kitchen phone (so said the phone company -- we do live in the country and occasionally hear but don't see a critter running between the floors). So the repair guy suggested that, since we don't want to rip out the walls, we get a base for somewhere else in the house and just replace the phone in the kitchen with an auxilliary. Also we weren't getting good reception on the unmatched phones we had been using. Very frustrating. This set with the expansion phones solved the whole problem. Sound is clear, speaker phone works nicely. I've shopped around online and in stores, and this is a good deal. I would recommend it. Maybe I should have given it 5 stars, but I've only had it a couple of months and I'm a believer in Murphy's law. But so far, so good."
4,AT&T EP5995 Base Review,"As typical AT&T products, this system is sturdy and works well. Its easy to install, navigate, and use. Unfortunately, if you are looking for all features, design, and finish, this is also a typical AT&T product. I was disappointed by not offering autodial (speed-dial), the cheap finish, and the amount of effort needed (force) to properly navigate through the menus with the cheap center mouse-like button. For the price I guess its a good buy, but its not the product I was looking for."
4,Back for more,I already had the base station and one phone and liked the product...so I bought two expansion handsets. They work great with no problems....
5,Excellent cordless phone system,"After coming off my old clunky cordless phones, this AT&T system is great. I purchased the base phone and 4 additional handsets. Lots of good and easy-to-use features, very sleek and lightweight, excellent sound quality. Been using it now for several months and have no complaints."
4,AT& T Cordless Anwering Machine,Read lots of reviews and purchased a couple of different phones before we settled on this one. Very happy with the quality of the sound. All the other ones sounded like you were using a tin can and didn't even work in all the areas of our home. This phone has some many options we haven't begun to use them all. My boys love the fact that you can program in all kinds of ring tones. We have a Caribbean one for the summer.
1,Very Poor Handset Volume,"If you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the ATT5995 or Handset590-3. Turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more, not even close. I do not have a hearing problem, but this phone had me thinking I did. The speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality."
3,In sum: marginally adequate,"After 18 months, my thoughts:- Battery shows low after 50-80 minutes of talking (after a 24+ hour charge).- Sound quality is good ... about 80% of the time, when I'm sitting in the same room.- Sound breaks up at about 30' away, through one interior wall.+ I like the caller-ID-specific ring tones.- About one-quarter of the time, caller ID doesn't always show the number/identity until the fourth ring.- Lowest volume ring is still pretty loud (bad if not everyone in the house is on the same schedule),If I'd paid full retail, I'd rate this phone 1-2 stars; for the $30 I paid, it's worth three."
2,disappointing product,"I've had this phone for over a year, and I'm very unimpressed. It feels like a cheap plastic toy. The sound quality is quite poor; even with the volume up to the max, I often have trouble hearing the caller. I've also missed a lot of messages, because it's way too easy to accidentally delete messages that haven't been listened to yet. Altogether, this is the worst quality phone I've ever had. Now that the batteries in the handsets have all died, I'll be quite happy to replace the whole thing."
2,Discomfort customer,"Looks great, but funtionally doesn't always show Caller ID, never Call Waiting. The handset dial no admits ID photos and its wallpapers doesn't can be changed. I'm very discomfort with this phone."
4,Perfect fit for a BMW X3,"Nothing much to say about them, other than they look no different than the OEM. The plug snaps into place correctly and are that would eventually contact the rotor snaps perfectly into the pad. This one in particular is the rear sensor: it is the correct length with the exact same mounting points: it is a consumable part that has to last as long as the pads do.Amazon fitment guide works very well and it's very convenient: I've bought several parts and consumable from Amazon and I've never had issues with it saying it would fit my vehicle and then turning out it wouldn't. Always spot on.Price wise I'm sure it's comparable with other sources.I'll buy it again."
4,A Short Cultural History,"This books seeks to give the reader a broad grasp of the space of Japan's cultural history. Important names and dates are mentioned in connection with their cultural accomplishments. More than simply telling who killed whom in what war and when, this book gives the reader a vague understanding of how Japan's customs, architecture, art, and prose evolved into the form they are today.This book is best for those who know next to nothing about the history of Japan and would like an outline with which to proceed to learn more."
4,A short introduction to Japanese History,This book is perfect for anyone who knows nothing about Japanese history (as I did). It is short and easily readable (less than 250 pages for Japanese history to WWII). As an introduction to Japanese history it does just what it should.....inspire you to learn more....
1,useless,"the come apart far too easily. I wanted to use them for a craft, but the folded rubber band kept getting undone and the bow itself wasn't knotted tight enough."
4,Adorable!,Very very cute but my PomPom is too fluffy so you can barely see them....I wish they'd be a tiny bit bigger.
5,"A Bizarre, Seductive World","""Young, virile, and hungering for something more than a stagnant New England mill town has to offer, Timothy is at a crossroads. He can work in the local lumberyard, his nightlife limited to fleeting, clandestine encounters with strangers. Or he can earn more money than he ever dreamed possible. The price: the next three years of his life. Now, willingly enslaved by the enigmatic man known only as Montclair, Timothy is imprisoned on a lavish estate. Here, his harshest nightmares--and most erotic dreams--are about to become reality. Never looking back, Timothy plunges into a bizarre, seductive world where his master's wish is his command--and where the ties that bind might just lead to true emancipation...""-- zebraz"
3,BDSM history...,"Well, hydraulically speaking it gets the job DONE wink wink , and it's a BDSM classic . So we can , really , overlook the silly bits , can't we ?"
4,Excellent for cookies,Look up Blue Ribbon Almond Roca Cookies on [...] and buy these toffee bits to make them. Incredibly delicious! I couldn't find these in any NYC store so was happy to find them on amazon.com. I did have to buy an entire case. But I was happy to share a few packs with family and friends so they could make their own batches or excellent cookies too.
3,"Good, But not Great","If you don't have alot of cash to spend, this album shows alot of Bird's best tunes from Savoy and Dial. If you've got like $30 to spend, or you don't have any parker and you want to try him hou, then get this and bird's best bop on vereve for most of his best work. (Although I cringe when I hear bird with strings) However, if you have more cash to spend, Get the complete Savoy and Dial master takes (It's like $40) and the complete verve master takes (another $40) With these, you'll have all the best bird, and also all the songs on the famed Omnibook. (Except that dang anthropolgy, anyone know where to get that one?) If you need to just get one, get the Savoy. I, like alot of other people I know, like his dial and savoy output much better."
3,"Good, not great","This is simply a compilation of Guitar World articles about and interviews with SRV. Interesting, but nothing new (for me anyway). But I had already read several other books about him and was simply looking for something that went a little deeper. This didn't do that for me. There are a couple of interviews with other people associated with Stevie (eg, Rene Martinez) that I did find interesting because it went into depth about Stevie's gear, particularly the components of his guitars. For my money, though, ""Caught in the Crossfire"" is the best book about SRV"
4,Nostalgic,I saw this movie at least 55 yrs ago and remembered it. Seeing it again was still nostalgic and message enjoyable. Nothing like the old movies. The CD was in excellent condition. Deliver fast. Recommend it to anyone who likes this type of genre.
5,Very Good,"I just watched this movie on TCM. I stumbled upon it this morining after I woke up. It is a wonderful fantasy type movie from 1944. This is my first time seeing it. It is worth owning and sharing with family and friends. I would call it a best kept secret of a movie. Not well known but most people would appreciate it. A haunting tale of love and mystery, of lives lived and lost and of course love. Casting is wonderful. This movie reminds me very much of the very early Twilight Zone episodes. I'd like to own it, but I am not crazy about the prices posted on Amazon right now. I wish I had known, I would have recorded it."
4,Prufer is worth a look,"A strange and marvelous book. When Prufer is good, he's really good. In ""For the Dead,"" ""Nocturnal,"" and the title poem, he creates, with vivid, unusual, carefully rhythmic language, a disconcerting sense of the oddness that underlies (or undercuts?) the everyday, a thrilling take on the suburban. A few poems fail-notably ""Into the Canyon"" and ""1979,"" because of their slave-ish narrative structures. Nevertheless, I sense in Prufer a powerful, exciting new voice in the all-too-barren world of contemporary American poetry."
2,Predictable dark turns etc,"I use this book as an example of the MFA creating narrative poems of minor insight from suburban white kids who seem to think that by concentrating on the ""darker moments,"" they are doing something, as if American Beauty has entered the academic halls,. But by this time these moves have become common. this was a disappointing tome from a fine editor--but being a good editor doesn't necesarrily make one a fine poet."
2,the neutered God,"kung is a smart man and a scholar. however, in trying to make christianity all-inclusive, he dilutes christianity into little more than dialectic feel-good mysticism. i think he needs to buy a Bible and reexamine/meet Jesus."
3,So Where did the fun from the last book go,"I read this book right after I read the 13th legion book and I had a really hard time finishing it. I enjoyed 13th legion and could not put it down but this one was a completely different story. Throughout the whole book it just seems to drag on and on, especially through the middle with the meetings with the Tau. It did not seem to have the spark that the first book did, nor any suprises that the first one did. Then when it finally did get into some action towards the end of the book, it was over very fast. I was disappointed."
4,good introduction to chaos,The book is a good introduction to chaos and the new edition has a chapter on synchronization that is a good review of the literature
1,holy bad reviews batman,"I believe this is a first: the first album I have ever read about here where the reviews are uniformly bad. (Hey, even Yes's Tales From Topographic Oceans is considered a classic here. (Actually, I kind of agree with that....))Anyway, I agree with these reviews to the letter, especially the comments on Pirates. I haven't heard the song in 20 years, but remember very clearly it being the only song on the album I really really liked, with Emerson's concerto being one I liked."
3,Loved Greg Lake's pieces - hated the rest,"When Works came out on vinyl, each artist had his own side in the two album set. Greg Lake's side is 5 stars. The rest bored me to tears. Greg Lake's songs combined lyrics and melody in a haunting fashion. They've stayed in my mind as incredibly beautiful pieces worth buying the the CD just to get his side again."
5,Play this one for Christmas,"This is ELP's definitive work before their early break-up in '78.The album is sentimental, and showcases their talent. Lake's vocals are serene and romantic. ""C'est la Vie"" is a classic example and one everyone probably has heard one time or another.I enjoy bringing this album (and now CD) for Christmas season to get away from the constant Christmas songs and to awaken new listeners, all who have been impressed and turned onto ELP. If I could play the top 5 ELP albums on my player, it would be: Emerson, Lake & Palmer (first album), Works vol. 1 and 2 (vol. 1 is a two CD) and ""Love Beach"". ""Black Moon"" is good, but it is of a different era for them. I like their first period before they regrouped. You be the judge."
2,4 sided disappointment,"As a maximum ELP lover, I cannot sit still through this album. The piano concerto on side one sounds like a sophomore composition class project, dusted off.Buddy Rich once told Johnny Carson (okay, I show my age here) that Carl Palmer was the best drummer ever; Rich did not exclude himself. On this album, Palmer's talent just does not show.Greg Lake's contribution is a less dismal contribution.Long story (too long by 4 vinyl sides) short, don't bother."
5,"A classic ""must have"" album for fans of folk guitar.","John Fahey was (and probably is) a fascinating and deeply troubled guy with more skill as a guitarist than as an entertainer who can connect with people. This album shows him at his best. Orinda Moraga is one of the loveliest things I've ever heard on a guitar. This album catches two odd and seemingly incompatible sides of Fahey: a sweet and melodic quality plus a stark and almost mathematically improvisational composing style that is both primitive and futuristic.Fahey's playing obviously influenced Leo Kottke, but that isn't why you want this album. If you like folk guitar, this album has some of the most inventive and listenable playing you'll ever find."
5,My favorite Fahey and excellent by any standard,"I bought this in the '70s when I was just getting into country blues and fingerstyle acoustic guitar playing. What a stroke of luck! Not only are the pieces on ""Blind Joe Death"" great to listen to, but they are also (in many cases) fairly simple to figure out and play. They also open up the world of alternative guitar tunings (open G or ""Spanish""; open D) to the uninitiated. Having just said that some of these pieces are relatively easy to play, I should also say that I'm still trying after decades to make them sound as good as Fahey does. This is a fantastic collection of songs that just gets better with repeated listening. ""Blind Joe Death"" is essential listening for you fingerpickers out there and for anyone else who likes acoustic guitar music."
1,Book Written for Greedy Intentions,"Dr. Lane wrote this book so he could sell his shark cartilage. He wrote this book to sell a product that does not work. Sharks do get cancer, but incidences of cancer are much lower than in humans. The shark immune system may be better adapted to combat cancer. That does not justify grinding up shark cartilage and selling it. Dr. Lane's company sells the stuff for $130 a pound. I would reccomend reading ""The Shark Chronicles"" by John A. Musick. The book does a great job of describing this awe inspiring creatures."
1,Bad science!,"Sharks don't get heartburn, athlete's foot or jock itch. So what?This book is about bad science at its worst."
1,Don't waste your money,"Quit buying this junk that pseudoscientists are selling to make a quick buck.Sharks do get cancer.A scientific study done by researchers at the Mayo Clinc showed not only that this stuff doesn't work, but ""toxicity related to shark cartilage resulted in significant trial drop out after one month."""
1,Silly book,"Sharks don't get heartburn, athlete's foot or jock itch. So what?This book is about bad science at its worst."
1,Falsehoods and snake oil.,"Sharks do get cancer. But, let's pretend like they didn't. How would grinding up their skeletal structure and eating it prevent you from getting it? Total bunk! Also, sharks DO rest and sleep. Nurse sharks spend most of their day lolli-gagging on the substrate. This book is best read to a bunch of wide-eyed children sitting cross-legged on the floor, much like Alice in Wonderland or The Velvetine Rabbit. Although, it's not quite as believable as those stories. These two hucksters are ALMOST as sinister as Kevin Trudeau. Now THERE'S a quack!"
1,Sharks DO get cancer!,"Sharks do get cancer it is a fact. This book is a lie.Don't let this book fool you into thinking you cant get cancer just because you eat a murdered shark fin, millions of sharks are slaughtered for their fins for no reason every year, it is screwing up our Eco system.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Quack medicine: Yes Sharks DO get cancer!,"This book's premise is fundamentally flawed. The authors try to promote the use of shark cartilage to cure cancer, but they use bad science. In fact, as any zoologist or marine biologist will tell you, sharks do get cancer! So much for accurate research. This book's information is dangerous for two reasons: 1) people may use this unproven treatment when they need traditional medicine, and 2) many sharks are being unnecessarily killed for their cartilage. A dangerous book and a waste of money."
1,Not Enough Examples,"This book does not provide enough examples to thoroughly cover each chapter. The end of chapter exercises are much harder than the examples given in the chapter. This book leaves you wanting more for your money. I advise any one to not buy or use this book. I had to use other books to try and figure out how to solve the problems for homework. I am going to put this book on my bookshelf and let it gather dust, its almost totally useless."
3,View from a student subjected to this book,"While probably not the worst book I've had to learn from, it seems like the people who wrote this book subscribe to the same philosophy of teaching that my professor uses, which is namely to keep closely to theory and not use too many examples. At least not any fully worked out examples, and hardly any with actual numbers. As a result, it's difficult to learn and easy to get lost.At the same time, I've looked in some other books and they're not much better. Woe is the student who has to learn solely from such an obtuse book (woe is me)"
1,Worst Textbook I've Ever Had,"This is my senior year of college so I've had my fair share of textbooks and this one is the worst. I don't know why my class even uses this book as it's over 10 years old. The age isn't even the real problem though, the problem is there are about 2 examples for every chapter and not enough description to figure out on your own how to do some problems. I have had books like this before, but those books had solutions to selected problems at least, so you could use similar problems as examples to figure out how to do other ones, but this book doesn't have any solutions. This book throws you in the fire and tells you not to burn, not helpful at all."
2,Not as helpful as it should be,"This book has decent to good explanations of the concepts used in probability. Reading the book does help a lot in understanding the theory and concepts of Probability , pdf's and cdf's. However, as an engineering student, I like to see examples of the methods that we are learning. Learning the theory on solving a problem and seeing special cases often is not sufficient for completely understanding how to solve a problem. This book has some good examples, but they are few and far between. There are a lot of ""examples"" that provide the reader with a word problem and then two answers. Again, just giving a problem and and answer does not show how to go about solving a problem or how to approach a problem. This a is a good book for the core concepts and theory, however it doesn't have near enough examples worked through and for that reason I give it only 2 stars."
4,"Good, not as good as the first.","I somehow thought that the secret about Maron not knowing that Chiaki is Sinbad should have stayed unrevealed through the second volume. It doesn't leave a hanging ending as good as the first one, at the end of volume one you're just so hung that you MUST buy the second one to see what Jeanne's response to Sinbad's requested promise. I knew Jeanne would say no but I was hoping for something a little more exciting. It's good and I really want to continue reading the series but I really hope it get's a bit better because I sort of lost the feeling of REALLY wanting to purchase the next volume."
2,Not Dependable,"If your gonna use this cane then you should probley weigh a hundred pounds or less. Its very pretty although some of the paint was peeling off when I got it. IT is very lightwieght... hum... Im being nice... CHEAP... when you lean on it you feel like your going to bend the handle, becase the handle bends and it may give way. A cane really needs some substance to do its job... this cane seems like it is made out of storm door alumnium... would not buy another from this manufacturer..."
3,Clickity,It serves its purpose however it makes a rather embarrassing clicking sound every time it touches the ground.
5,"High quality, great value",We bought this for my wife's mother to replace her non-offset handle cane. This very sturdy and attractive cane gives her a much more steady assist.
3,Cane Review,"Since there are lots of other reviews, I would like to limit my comments to a few remarks that are not always addressed by others.The cane is strong enough to support weight. The hand grip is some kind of foam, not very comfortable. It gives a good grip but will probably become grubby. I prefer a grip that fits the hand better and that is easier to wash.The second point is that the rubber tip is fine on a super clean floor but if there is anything on the floor, it will slip. I spilled some herb powder and nearly took a dive.All-in-all, if I had it to do over again, I would buy a completely different cane.Update: I did buy another cane, same company but foldable and with a wooden handle (and less expensive). I like it better except for one detail. The foam handle and curve in the cane make it easier to hang from a counter. However, unless this is important, I would definitely say the foldable cane is more comfortable and more aesthetic. Moreover, it does not seem weaker."
3,"Spotted design is black & white, not leopard","Unfortunately there is not a close-up of the ""spotted"" design. It looked to me like a leopard print. It is actually a black and white design, not zebra but black and white leopard spots. Not what I wanted or expected, so I am returning this otherwise very nice cane. I have another in the Hawaiian flower print and it's really beautiful. Not so crazy about this one, thought I would warn anyone else who might also see the print as brown leopard. ;)"
5,Perfect Stand,"We bought this for our daughter, who plays both Flute and Alto Sax. This product is outstanding.The Build Quality is excellent and does what you need and want a stand to do, all while protecting your instrument investments."
4,My four-year-old loves it.,"We borrowed this book from the library, and I've read it to my son probably 6 times in the last 24 hours. The story and illustrations are clever and funny--I didn't even mind reading it twice in a row. I might actually have to buy us our own copy."
4,A must for any cat 'owner',"Anyone who lives with a cat will know exactly where the writers of this book are coming from. A very humourous collection of songs which reflect the moods of many a cat.Not only are the songs enjoyable to read, but the illustrations are an added pleasure.The only thing which lets the book down is the size of it. A few more songs, for the price paid, wouldn't have gone a miss."
3,Egregious errors,"I don't know how to rate this book because most of what Robinson is talking about is way over my head, but I found two glaring errors within two pages of Blue Mars. On p. 599 he says the current caused by the Coriolis effect in the southern hemisphere is clockwise. WRONG -- it's counter-clockwise. And on p. 600, he has Maya climb up in the halyards of a sailboat. Lots of luck Maya; the halyards are the lines that raise the sails. Maya could climb the shrouds, if the shrouds are fitted with ratlines, but not the halyards. Mistakes like this make me question the accuracy of everything else in the book."
1,"The First Two Were Brilliant, But Skip This One","The first two titles in this trilogy, Red Mars and Green Mars, are two of the most fascinating books, science fiction or otherwise, that I have ever read.It was frustrating to find that the final book, Blue Mars, was plodding, uneventful and even irritating."
2,"Robinson falls in love with his descriptions, forgets plot","After reading Green Mars, I couldn't wait to see how the trilogy turned out. Alas, I was disappointed. Robinson seems to have fallen in love with his vision of the future, and describes it in great and glorious detail, but doesn't seem to DO anything in this new environment he's created. I admit I like novels with action, and these endless descriptions bored me, so perhaps others have a different opinion. I could see the value in describing Mars in such detail in the 1st book of the series, to set the stage. And scientifically it was interesting, as I don't know much about Mars except what appears on The National and in Time Magazine. But scientific interest isn't satisfied with speculation about how Mars might look (in minute detail) after several decades of terraforming. A tedious ending to what otherwise was an interesting and entertaining series."
1,Where's a good editor when you need one,"Blue Mars isn't a novel, it's a core dump. How Mr. Robinson's publisher let him get away with this formless foolishness is both mysterious and frustrating. Red/Green Mars were very compelling novels. Blue Mars is like a big block of stone with a beautiful sculpture trapped inside; unfortunately, no one bothered to do any of the hard work of getting it into proper shape. Robinson needs a good spanking for getting so sloppy."
2,Not very good,"Eh...More of a politic preaching whiney - things should be this way or that - than real sci-fi.Perfect ending to a REAL let-down series.For all the great reviews, I just didnt find this too interesting.No great revelation(s), no real surprises, just a LONG ramble on politics...Eh...It only put me literally to sleep a few times, though it in my bulldog style I refused to stop, and just call it a waste.Id you are on the fence, skip this one..."
4,"Great with male characters, but the females need some work.","I liked this series very much. I was in awe of the technical writing and found the plots likeable. I read Red Mars, Green Mars, and Blue Mars together and the further I got the more annoyed I became with the female characterizations. Robinson is clearly better at writing about men. His male characters have such depth and are intriguing. The female characters are either mentally unbalanced, sex addicted, jealous, petty or incomplete with lack of description. The males have such interesting relationships with each other, but I can't think of any females in any of the books who are even friendly with each other. I liked this series very much and loved the men characters, but the books would have been much better with more rounded female characters."
3,"Hard to get through, but satisfying enough","I picked up Blue Mars in hopes that it would bring a brilliant conclusion to the Mars series. This last book, however, was the most difficult one to get through. All three books are certainly well thought out and the research that must have gone into them would drive most writers insane. I appreciate that research, but it bogged me down. I had to speed read through several passages. The only thing that kept me reading to the end was my interest in some of the characters. I do commend Robinson on his characters. They are all complex and believable. I think that the characters and the research undertaken for such a grand project is what earned him the awards. I would have enjoyed a bit more action and intensity, especially at the end."
1,"a disappointment, a waste of time","red was good. green was ok. blue was like dragging myself through literary molasses. i found myself skipping entire paragraphs and still being in the same place. the descriptions have been given before and they just drag on and on. also, there is a fair amount of repetition in how the characters are feeling.i like to finish things, and so i somehow read through it. didn't enjoy it at all, however."
5,A fitting end to a landmark trilogy,"Blue Mars grabbed me and swept me through its pages as well and as quickly as the first two books. Robinson deserved his Hugo for this, and more. If you liked the first two books, this one will not disappoint."
5,Great series!,Kept me reading. A bit cerebral at times - but a good read nonetheless. My grown children also enjoyed it.
1,Boring Politcal Nonsense,"Robison has the Earth experiencing disasters due to man-made global warming (something I have serious doubts about), while colonists are completing the terraformiong of Mars. It raises the question - ""Why not terraform the Earth?"" Surely stabilizing the Earth's climate would be easier than making frozen Mars habitable. Instead of sending the space mirror from Mars to Venus - why not send it to Earth to divert a little sunlight?Once the logic of the larger story collapses, we are left with nothing but boring stories of flat characters."
2,If you Like to Read Geological Brochures of Mars....,"If you like that, then You will find that here and also in the other two books of the serie, for sure. As almost in any sci-fi novel, this is plagued with boring scientists deprived of real life and features but just schematic cartoons, too much factual descriptions of unexistent or unimportant things and in general an uncredible lack of real literature and drama. When it exist, is just pointed as in a Power Point presentation.Sci-Fi as his best, that is to say, at his most boring and shallow."
2,boring,"Dh hole reizen i even pikd up Red Mars wuz b cuz i wanted 2 reid Blu Mars. I reilizd dho, dhat in ordr 2 get 2 Blu Mars, I had tu reid Red Mars and Green Mars first. Aftr draggin my way thru Red Mars and Green Mars, wich wur ok books, I end up with a useless peice uv wut pasez az a book cald Blu Mars dhat took me half a semestr tu finish!"
2,tedious,Seemed too much of describing the same things over and over. While Red Mars was interesting and new Blue Mars just seemed tedious to me. Sorry can't think of a better description.
4,string theory,I thought it was interesting and maybe funny that 1t0 years in the future the scientist were still trying to prove string theor in this novel. Although the book had a tendency to go way to far into detail I still like the book very much.
2,Unconvincing end,"Robinson's Mars Trilogy begins as admirably written hard science fiction, based for the most part on physics and geology. As the story progresses, the plot is based more and more upon Robinson's previous suppositions than on fact - in short, he begins to extrapolate. By the last page of the last book, we're asked to believe that human beings can postpone death almost indefinitely, have solved the problem of war, and are ready to colonize space, all in about three hundred years. My willing suspension of disbelief wore out about two-thirds of the way through the last book."
4,Fitting conclusion to remarkable vision,"Red Mars, the first book of this trilogy, was one of the most interesting and complex visions of the future colonization of Mars (a project that is certainly not too far in the future), but the followup (like many middle volumes) seemed at times formless and directionless. Thus, my delay in reading Blue Mars.Although Blue Mars did not recapture the magic of Red Mars, it is certainly a fitting conclusion to Robinson`s Mars trilogy and is a remarkable vision of the future. As a novel, Blue Mars (unlike much of Robinson`s earlier fiction like Red Mars, The Pacific Edge, and the Gold Coast) is unsuccessful, with little plot or interesting characterization, but as a meditation on the future, environmentalism and myriad other topics Blue Mars is fascinating."
4,An absorbing Read,The scientific attention to detail was fabulous and far out weighs the attempt at a social structure that would never functionThe characters are realthe landscape touchable........and the growing atmosphere can be tastedWaiting for the next step out into the galaxy from Kim Stanley Robinson
2,Mars trilogy ends with a whimper,"Red Mars was absolutely riveting, one of the best SF books ever: Green Mars was not quite as good as Red Mars, but it kept up a good pace and interesting story. Blue Mars runs out of gas. I got tired of reading about people just wandering around Mars"
3,"Haunting and hopeful, but where was the editor?","The final 200 pages of this book are among the most rewarding I've experienced in SF. Haunting and hopeful, a tale of redemption and foregiveness, there is a touching maturity to the writing that is rarely reached in this genre. Its too bad you have to work through the first 500 pages to get there.With good editing, this could have been a brilliant 400 page instant classic. As it stands (at 762 pages), it requires incredible patience and endurance from the reader. But the payoff is there if you stick with it."
1,200 pages too long,"With all the hype with this book I expected better than I got. The book would have been good minus the thinly veiled socio-political commentaries and disertations. ( adding to about 200 pages)I got to the end wondering if this had a real point. The plot lines referred to in Red and Green Mars must have been great because they sounded better than the ones in Blue.All in all, not a coherent book."
3,Long and boring............................................,"Because I read the trilogy together, I'll review it as one.The plotting is plodding. The fun characters all get killed in the civil war in Red Mars, so we're left following the lives of the the ones who played it safe, e.g. boring. The descriptions are verbose. If I never hear or see the word ""piste"" again, I'll be a happy person. The only reason I can see for the major breakthrough that extends everyone's life, is so we can follow the same (boring) characters through 1600 pages and 200 years.On the positive side, there are enough high points in the political (not scientific) struggle for the reader to have fun.All in all, the Hugo and Nebula voters had better do better in the future. They voted for hype and not substance."
1,Most boring book I ever read!,"Red Mars was great, Green Mars was OK, but this one is totally without interest. 700 pages of blablabla, bad pop psychology, depresive caracters, no intrigue at all. Nothing happens in the whole book and the end is just more of the same, nothing special, nothing final.I think that all the good stuff happened in the first book, and that all the good caracters died in that book also. In the other two books, all the caracters do is think about the past and feel bad for now. Politics, politics, boring politics. Nothing else...A poor ending for a series that started well. Don't waste your time and money on that one."
5,the infinite resolution of god's eye,"Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy probably worked for you if you love science, literature, and people. Or if it didn't work for you, you may not be into extended, involved discourse. Blue Mars seemed to have a bit more than the first two books. But that makes sense--this dream-world expands in our minds, from a tiny speck, the words ""Red Mars"". KSR seems to progressively relax during the course of the stories, drawing out the descriptions of places, people, and ideas further and further, expanding the horizons of the narrative, in a way that compliments the concurrent expansion of our own minds as we read the books. He seems to explore each thread, each idea, as long and deeply as he possibly can. But this is only fitting. Before we die we want to go deep--go deep into reality. And if great books can't do it for us, what else do we hope will? How long can KSR make the now? As long as you're willing to let him."
2,Robinson goofs again,"On p.652 Robinson says, "" the rods in the retina tend to see best in the three primaries. "" WRONG! The cones, not the rods, percieve colors and the colors they perceive are vermillion, green and violet, NOT the three primaries but closer to the three secondaries. He goes on to say that a green and red spotlight combine to form a color but he doesn't know what and says, ""Look at an artist's color wheel."" WRONG AGAIN! The color made by a red and green spot is yellow, the same color your eye sees if the vermillion and green cones in the retina are stimulated. An artists color wheel will show the results of mixing pigments, not light. He is confusing the subtractive process of reflected light, in which pigments mask out all but the color you see and the additive process, in which light adds to light, the ""secondary"" colors blending to create the ""primary "" colors. Does Robinson research anything or does he just rely on his own faulty and vague recollections?"
1,Robinson needs an editor,"I've read almost all the Hugo and Nebula winners and I don't know of any works less deserving of these awards than the Mars trilogy. If all three books (1900 pages or so) had been condensed to one 300 pager, it might have had enough plot, exciting characters, intriguing ideas, to have been worth it. For a classic tale of Mars colonization, I much prefer ""The Martian Chronicles."""
3,I tried to read the entire trilogy straight through,"I was on such a roll from the previous two books in the series that I read this straightaway after finishing Green Mars. It was too much. I think at this point in the series the book was just getting too complicated to follow everything and remember everything going on. I'm going to have to read the series again, but pace myself.Still, the immagery of the changes on Mars, the oceans, development of life, development of government, development of already very developed relationships was intense. I found myself longing to be there, wishing that Mars can be colonised in my lifetime.This is something good to read if you've read the previous two books, just be prepared for some VERY involved, detailed writing.Another note, this book is writen from a very liberal point of view.....I found the concepts of the government being put in place intriguing, and in a perfect world(maybe Mars?) it could work."
2,Blue Mars - The Geology Lesson,"This series had great ideas, and a great story line. What it didn't need was an extended geology lesson. Robinson seemed to be focused on the look of the land, as though you were using a map as you read. After a while, all the escapements, plateaus, and canyons melded together. Story should have been the main emphasis, not geography..."
2,"Red Great, Green Good, Blue Bad","Maybe it's because the first two were so very good, but Blue Mars will leave you blue in the face at its unfulfilled potential. I constantly found myself skimming boring sections re-hashed from the previous two novels, the characters lacked development in any significant way, and the storyline went virtually nowhere. Unfortunately for its readers, you have to finish Blue Mars to get closure. I bought the entire trilogy at a going-out-of-business sale for 50% off, so I can justify the money -- just not the time wasted on this final book of the series."
2,Hard for trilogy and even harder to finish it,It is a pity I could not feel good about this trilogy because of missing the SF favors. I agree with most of the reviewers. Red is better than Green and Green is better than Blue.
2,"Interesting subject, but the pace is way too slow.","The sociological implications of this book are very large, and reveal a complex and worthy work of documentation and set-up. The style is not as fluid as it should be, and the story gets sometimes too slow to follow, and jumps around too much."
3,Steam runs out in the third book,"Robinson accomplished something magnificent with this trilogy, but it is in the third book that his weaknesses overwhelm his strengths. Character development and plot are clearly elements of writing that Robinson has some issues with, and while he masterfully overcame these problems in the first two books, he erred by killing off most of the most interesting characters and replacing them with much less fleshed out scabs. The one interesting replacement character, Art, disappears along with the entire Praxis subplot. This third book frankly drags on interminably with little advancement of plot. Belatedly, Robinson attempts to show us an even more radical future and introduces another dramatic twist in the field of gerentology, but its not enough.I enjoyed the first two books a lot. Unfortunately, the third book replaced the sense of excitement that I had in reading the first two with a sense of obligation."
2,Uncomfortable,"I found this product very uncomfortable to wear. I used it for a chest guard in martial arts, but unless it is a completely standing art without a lot of bending, it is uncomfortable.Bending forward with your chin tucked to your chest, the plastic guard catches your chin. I modified the plastic and cut away at it hoping to improve, and it did get a little better, but still caught me in the chin any time I had to do a somersault type movement.Also, when pressure is placed on the guard and you move/twist, it cuts into the side under your arms (and I wore a sports bra and tank top underneath)It is a good guard to protect against striking while standing, maybe I just wasn't using it properly."
2,not much info,"This may be a good book for someone that knows nothing about the breed and doesn't want to make much of a financial investment to learn some of the basics in order to determine if they want to pursue it further. It appears to me that the first section of the book is the only part directly related to mastiffs. I could be wrong, but after the first section every comment focuses on ""your new puppy"" and doesn't specify the breed. It tells you general health concerns that a new ""parent"" should be aware of no matter what breed the puppy is. A much better book (in my opinion)that is in the same price range would be ""Mastiffs: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual,"" by Kim Thornton. It's a ""Barron's"" book. This book at least alerts potential owners of health concerns SPECIFIC to the mastiff breed so that new ""parents"" know what to watch for."
1,Not great :(,"Very disappointing! As a mastiff lover I expected lots of useful information and pictures from this '#1 selling mastiff book'. 50/192 pages contain sort of original information, the rest is just repetition of other older and better books.I also bought the kennel clubs mastiff book at the same time and that was well worth the money.This book is not worth the money and I will be freecycling it."
4,Wonderful dogs,I think this book gives a great overview of mastiffs and also some more general information. I think if you are looking to get a Mastiff than this would be a quick read to help you decide if you think a Mastiff is for you.
1,These people will cheat you!,"Don't order from TheFactoryDepot! I ordered what I thought was a CASE of Life Savers for $14.66. Instead they sent me a PACKAGE of Life Savers which I can get at Walmart for $1.33!! I have talked to them on the phone and they refuse to send me the other 11 packages and they said, ""You saw what you were buying so we don't have to do anything about it!"" They also refuse to send me a refund but offered me a discount on my next purchase! Ha! When satan gets a snowblower! I am now going to call my credit card company and contest the charge. DON'T BE FOOLED - THESE PEOPLE CHEATED ME!"
5,This dude is totally WACKED LOL!,"Ruud Kleinpaste is an absolute blast here! I haven't laughed like that in quite a while. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this Blu-ray on my 110"" front projection system. It made these bad boy bugs even bigger and badder! I found the video quality to be fantastic. Most scenes looked like you could walk right into the screen - totally liquid clear. Colors were a little oversaturated, so I just turned the color down a tad. This one's definitely a keeper!"
4,The bug man,The World's Biggest and Baddest Bugs [Blu-ray] Well the fellow in this Blu-ray is to bugs what Steve Irwin was to Crocodiles. Quite entertaining and informative. And a great value.
2,Not the same...,"Smells like perfume I've had lying around for 10yrs...or, Raid..not sure.... not what I'm used to! Should've stuck with Vera...."
4,Second Helping Review,"My wife and I are grandparents to three boys aged 3-10. Reading the accounts of the the Harbaughs with their grandchildren/grandnephews brought memories of our experiences with our grandkids. Hank, Ruth,and Jim Harbaugh have the gift of being able to relay stories of watching and participating in the growth of their loved ones in an entertaining writing style. I would hope that they would consider doing a followup when those young boys are older. For any grandparents or parents, I would highly suggest that you pick up this warm and enjoyable book."
4,Experiments in Transcendence,"The premise of this album is so compelling: two teams of artists who take turns reworking the tracks until they're finished. Think of it like combat, like a duel. My brother and I sometimes write music this way and the results are always fascinating, not to mention bizarrely hybridized.THX: Experiments... is probably the album I've listened to most in the last year. I got it last Christmas (actually, I got two copies, but that's another story) and still have it in my car at least one day out of three.The standout tracks are 1, 3, and 10. In fact, track 3 (Break-in at Apt. 205) is worth the price of the CD. Songs this bad-a$$ are rarer than rare. Pop this in your car's CD player and I promise you'll feel like you're in a music video.There aren't any bad tracks on here, it's all quality material. I particularly liked the contributions of Swayzak, but then, I'm partial to them.Get this CD if you like: Theorem, Swayzak, Detroit, Berlin, Minimalism, and/or Tech-House"
1,Be afraid (as one has already said),"If you do not know the topic already at the authors' level, then do not buy this book. You need a towel to get thru. I had impression that the book had been cut down by the editors to save space - some explanations (or should I say - lack of) just drive you crazy.Cochrane is much much better (but it is only about asset pricing)."
4,Good approach to learning financial econoimcs,"This is one of the few straight-forward introductory financial economics textbooks. The main reason I like this book is because it teaches the actual economics behind finance, which is sometimes left behind in a lot of more applied texts. There is a decent discussion on the ""Fundamental Theorem of Finance"", but it is quite scattered around in different parts of the book. However, this is probably one of the most important issues that first-year Ph.D. students should know. There is also a good discussion on spanning, which is not found in most books."
2,Uninteresting reference book,"You will learn nothing about economics or finance from this book. If you are at the PhD level in finance and math, this could be used as a reference book. It is simply the bare bones of finance. For the rest of us there are better options"
4,"But I STILL want the old ""Radio Dinner"" album...","Yes, this is gorgeous humor. But honestly, WHEN will they re-release the old ""Radio Dinner"" album? Us baby boomers wanna re-live the exciting days of the Nixon/McGovern campaign:""Some of you are asking, why, in announcing our complete withdrawal from Vietnam, and the legalization of marijuana, I am wearing these ludicrous headlamps on my ears. Well, let me explain.""::sigh::But this one will do until that happy day.wistfully,"
3,"Sigh, loaded with stereotypes","This is an eyecatching book. It looked funny too--2 dogs named Safe and Sound go on a trip around the world. The pictures were colorful. And so I borrowed it from the library for my young son. The illustrations are indeed interesting, the storyline had potential. Unfortunately, it is loaded with stereotypes. The xenophobic will find it funny and agree with the cultural jokes. But do we want our children to see the world through such simplistic views? Do we want to promote such stereotypical views? I hope not."
4,"Good visuals, but who coached the narrator?","This is a short video, only about 30 minutes, and it gives a condensed overview of Lisbon. While it does whet the appetite and remind me of the time I lived in Portugal, I wonder who taught the narrator how to pronounce the Portuguese names for places and things. This is so common with well-intentioned people who enjoy travel but who have no ear for foreign languages. His pronunciation of Alfama and fado made me giggle as I tried to figure out what he was saying. All that said Lisbon is a beautiful city and the Portuguese are wonderful people, just don't try to pronounce anything the way the narrator does and you'll be OK."
4,Good!,This book was very interesting and gave a lot of history about Cedar Point. It was very informative. I would like to see a second one come out that has all the latest updates about the park.
5,A great book for the lovers of Cedar Point!!,This book tells you everything that you ever wanted to know about Cedar Point. I learned about things in this book that I never even knew happened!! I loved it and recommend it for Cedar Point lovers everywhere!!
5,"Great book, up-to-date",This is a fun and easy to understand book for a often-tedious though important subject --corporate finance. Wachowicz takes pain to update the book through his web page. Excellent!
4,Great book. Easy to understand but leaves a few things out,"I bought the 9th edition as the bookstore was clearing old stocks. At US $1.20 this book is a bargain, though the value of the information in this book is obviously much more than that.It covers most topics but some things like derivatives are given only a cursory glace.Nevertheless a good introduction to the basics of financial management."
4,"Great, but missing a great track","While it's true that both the 1959 version and the 1967 version of BLIND JOE DEATH are contained on this CD, the disc is missing the 1967 version of ""The Transcendental Waterfall."" While that is certainly no reason not to buy this disc, buyer should beware that this track is missing. In my opinion, this missing track smokes the 10-minute version that was included on this reissue. This missing track is why I did not give this disc five stars. But get the disc anyway; it's still worth your time and money."
5,A deserving classic,"Of course this is a very influential album, but that's not what makes it valuable. It's just really, really good. Fahey modernized the blues/ragtime repertoire on the acoustic guitar, making it relevant to modern, mostly white audiences, and his style was plagiarized into everything from Kottke's drive to New Age blandness. What's really great about this, though, is that the old country blues is his touchstone for sound. To those who think fingerstyle acoustic guitar sounds like Windham Hill, it's going to sound harsh and aggressive. But then again, Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon would give them heart attacks."
3,Influential but Overrated,"That ""The Legend of Blind Joe Death"" is an influential album is unquestionable. Many recording artists of the 1960s note it as a touchstone. What is more debatable is the overall quality of muscianship on the album. It's often a mistake confuse ""spare"" and ""introverted"" with genuis. While in time Fahey would in time emerge as something of a underground guitar icon, the work here is decidely middling compared to the great Delta Blues artists that Fahey drew inspiration from, Skip James, John Hurt et al. and some of his later works which are technically more interesting. Probably worth adding to your collection. But don't expect more out of it than it has to offer."
2,"Land of Gods, But Where Did They Come From?","Increasingly, examination of our past reveals that there once was a Golden Age of mankind. Did its origins lay in some fantastic acount of ancient spaceports and alien intervention, or did man, by himself, achieve great things in his remote past? Sitchin opts for the fantastic, and reviewer Paul Stets writes, ""It is not important whether Sitchin's writings are true... (Sitchin) creates an illusion of scientific research."" Is illusion or entertainment enough? To many of us truth matters."
2,Uh....I must not have read the previous reviews well,"As a christian, not really my type of book. I must not have read the previous reviews well and overlooked the true description. Great for someone who is in to the sci-fi type of reading."
5,More details and descriptives as suspected.,"Sitchin comes through in his usual fortay with insite and meaning to all those nagging questions who, where, and why."
5,Great quality,I've owned this bracelet for a couple of years now. Have worn it every day and it still look like brand new.
4,"Learn about the construction of a poet, as well of poetry.","Having recently become an avid reader of online journals, and never having been a particular fan of poetry, I was intimidated when I first began reading Plath's jounrals, unabridged, no less. I have no regrets! Apart from the obvious value to artists, writers, and poets everywhere, Plath's journals offer a unique window through the mind of a highly intelligent woman on gender relations and the times in which she lived. And one thing this book most certainly did was give me a far greater appreciation for poetry and wordplay as art. If you feel you can handle the sheer volume of the work, definately pick up a copy if for no other reason than to read from time to time to see a master of the art at work. I also agree with many of the other reviewers' comments about the format of the notes; as someone who wanted to read through chronologically and reference the notes fairly often, that aspect of presentation was disappointing."
5,"Insightful, Articulate, Eloquent","Much has been made of Sylvia Plath's depression, angst and despair (conditions that plagued her for the duration of her life).Yet, these journals and personal accounts also shed light on and reveal the joy and amazement she felt for life (particularly in her teenage years). This, more than anything, should be the reason you read this publication. That and the fact, she is quite easily the most articulate and eloquent writer of our times."
5,Brilliant and inspiring work!,A rare glimpse into the complicated mind of a true poetic genius. This book is highly enlightening and a must-read for Plath fans and book aficionados alike. It is such a shame that Hughes destroyed the journals following the ones published in this work.
4,sylvia's little demons,"i have always loved sylvia's poetry, and i just bought this book from my book club. i could not put it down. it was beautiful and terrible and heartbreaking to watch her unfold. it seems odd to me though that ted destroyed the journal that was current to within three days of her suicide. (and i was quite disappointed by the omission of them) my only problem with it was that i hated to see it end where it did...i felt gypped by the sudden stop."
4,More Plath!!!,"Just in time for a public still haunted by Plath's life and death. These wonderful diaries clue you into the pain of a depressive, the struggle of the young writer, and the hope that a young woman had despite the oppressive confines of 50s society in America. To see more of Sylvia Plath's life is to recognize that many of the invisible obstacles standing in the way of happiness for millions of women are still in place in our society today-- that we all have phantoms, that they still lurk, quietly, in our own lives."
4,"Great Book , but Wish Ted Hughes had not destroyed parts....","I love this book and read it again and again. It gives deep and detailed descriptions of life in 1950s England and to a lesser extent the U.S.This book is achingly poignant, yet brutally and at times a shocking account of one of the greatest American Poets of all time.The only reason it gets 4 stars is because Ted Hughes destroyed parts of the journal written during the last few weeks of her life.If you are a Sylvia Plath lover, then this book is a must-read!"
4,Profoundly Sad,"As I read the morbid journals of Sylvia Plath, I find that all of them have a beautiful intensity. Her words, which have a beautiful movement, are an extended description of her inner life. Her mind, illuminated always by poetry and prose, is moved by slight moments to rapture and despair. Even as she describes the raptures of being seventeen, her prose displays a profound melancholy, as though the fires of her nature foreshadow her darkest tendencies."
4,Good songwriting wins the day for English chap.,"Most of the songs on this album are beautifully thought out and performed. Songs like ""Infinite Combinations"" and ""Cupid and Prycho"" are gems that reveal the unique universe of singer-songwriting. The production is understated which suits most of the material but in some places is rather dry. Wes communicates a personal and engaging sense of the world that is somehow soothing and compelling."
5,Excellent,"May be the best singer songwriter of the past 40 years. Check out his song ""I'm Wrong About Everything"", on ""The Confessions Of St. Ace"". He has the best insight into relationships between men and women."
2,"Likeable, just not memorable","I find myself nodding to the rhythm of Harding's pleasant melodies, and occasionally humming along, but it's just not memorable. Songs meander along, finding there way to an eventual end, but they are nothing more than a mild diversion. I realize as I write this, I couldn't summarize one of these songs a day after I've heard it. One song blends into another; he creates an overall feeling of competence and professionalism, but I find the songs lacking in true emotion. Nothing wrong with that, but I want so much more from music. (I also had trouble with his rhyming ""insecure"" with ""manure"" ouch!)"
2,Defying the Laws of Physics,"I purchased this because my digital kitchen timer expired of old age. I thought this one was cute, the price had been slashed, plus I thought the thermometer might come in handy if I decided to brew tea at school (I use a candy thermometer at home).The timer is somewhat irritating due to the fact that it can be set only in ascending fashion; this, however, isn't a big deal. The real problem is that according to the thermometer, water boils at about 190 Fahrenheit. Since I live in NYC and not, say, Denver, I have to assume that I'm dealing with seriously defective equipment. To add insult to injury, the readings are barely legible and are in two- rather than five-degree increments which makes judging a brewing temperature of, say, 175 something of a problem. In addition to being inaccurate, the readings--such as they are--are extremely slow.A clever idea, stylishly implemented, but of only marginal utility for brewing tea. Save your money."
2,Disappointed,This towel was of poor quality and was not as shown in the picture represented on Amazon. The towel was purple with a completely different K-State logo. Very disappointed and too late to return as this arrived a few days before Chirstmas and was a present for my 11-year old stepson.
4,A well balanced thriller,"This is a thriller that manages to hit all the bases. From the love interests all the way to the action.If you want to take a chance on a new author, this is a good place to start. I am looking forward to the next book from this talented author."
4,Perfect!,"Sent quickly & arrived quickly. CD was not in original case (simply a CD-R jewel case with the cover folded into it.) But of course, the post never said it was an original case either."
2,"Really poor fit, good function","Functions well, decent sound quality, a lot easier to have a conversation than using the phone (Alias) itself. However, the earpieces are incredibly large, and I have probably average-sized ears. It is difficult to keep them in your ears, they are uncomfortable, and they are heavy compared to other earbuds. The earbuds from airliners fit better than these. When I got these, they were the only game in town. Now, I'm looking around, and see that I have more choices. Yippee!"
1,Interesting as a biographical piece,"This movie is the typical bollywood potpourri, with the usual plot twists and reversals. Like most Indian films, the sound is added later, and the dubbing is poorly coordinated. It is interesting only in that it shows how far Ash Rai has come as an actress since this earlier film (98). Her acting is truly poor, but this partly reflects the weak writing for her character; despite that excuse, it's hard to believe that just one year later she delivered the performance in Straight From the Heart (99), a far better movie. PS: there is Nothing about Jeans in the movie; Genes, yes."
2,Chiropractics,"This is another book which lacks insight into the Source of all health. There is a limited amount of insight and once he understands HOLY Spirit, it can become a very good book."
1,Poor Quality!!!!!,This was our first disc to try in our new blu-ray. What garbage! There was one part on the disc where there was so much grainy black I thought our machine wasn't working. I'm not sure what others could have liked about this producton becasue my husband and I found it lacking. Don't waste your money.
1,Does not do justice!,"Unfortunately, they completely missed the mark. I am from Chicago, and I was eager to see their interpretation of the city. Most people who do not know the city, travel guides and tour shows call us the ""Second City"" and a ""small unimportant version of New York"". This dvd plays right into that. Not only do they only show downtown, except for a clip of a museum, but they show suburbs as part of the city. Then to top it off, they show the John Hancock building and label it the Sears Tower. The tallest office building in the world, formally the tallest building in the world, is not even recognized.Now I'm not just biased for Chicago, the whole state of California was dwindled down to basically L.A. and a few parting shots of greenery and even New York was only recognized for Manhattan.This dvd was a terrible representation of America."
2,Tom Skerrit?,"If you are a relentless fan of narrator Tom Skerrit, you may love this one hour, not-so-high-definition extravaganza. Or maybe you would enjoy footage of the WTC without jets crashing into them. Quite understandable. But even so, do you really need to add this to your ""collection?"" No."
1,Sucked for the money paid,I was expecting a better quality video. Instead I got a video that lacked good quality photography and also not real Blu-ray feeling when I watched it. Its not worth spending money on this.
5,America is Beautiful,This is a really Beautiful Blu-ray disc and it is so true America is Beautiful..
2,Don't buy this movie,"Why not? Well, it's beautifully filmed and a great advertisement for blu-ray, but too short for the money and not that engaging throughout despite some magnificent shots."
1,Irritating Instrument,"The Theremin on this album seems to be an awful instrument to listen to over any length of time. I think that the Timbre of the Theremin used for this album is poor. Possibly modern Theremins are better in this regard. I feel as though I have thrown good money away.As an analogy, I think that this may be likened to Kenny G playing the slide whistle instead of a soprano sax!"
5,This first effort has fantastic research and composition.,"With the push of technology we can literally work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For most of us this has meant specialization. Not so in the renaissance. Mr. Morrison's work takes us back to a time of patience, hard work and delayed gratification. It's not surprising that he was recognised for his work by the Academy of Illustrators (a lifetime achievement for most illustrators - rarely bestowed on freshman attempts). Antonio is sure to be a classic for children as well as parents. It is a great model for how ""quality time"" can be cultured"
2,"Can't seem to find the ""zone"" on this one.","I had a very difficult time with this book. The author contradicted himself so many times. One chapter he was saying do not hold on to losing positions then in the very next chapter he says you must learn to release your losing positions.I just couldn't follow him at all. However, out of the whole book he did make one good recommendation and that was to take emotion out of your trading."
5,Terrific and sensible advice,"Finally, I found a book that tells WHY we do what we do when we trade stocks, rather than give us mechanical trading advice, and then tells how to correct bad, destructive old habits. If you pay attention to the psychology involved in trading, as explained so clearly by Dr. Kiev, I think anyone can apply his advice to one's own style, see one's mistakes and one's good points, and recognize how to deal with ""down"" days as well as ""up"" ones. Besides, when you start to think about his suggestions on analyzing one's own approach to trading, you see that it applies to other areas of life, too. This is a remarkably sensible and readable book."
2,Ho-Hum,"Dr. Kiev hits all of the ""should's and should not's"" but it is still hard to differentiate in the heat of a trading day. It's much like pro football, plenty like to criticize the coach and team on Monday morning if the team loses but, they are heroes if they win. This book hits me like that. The psychology is trading is a warranted topic. Traders can make bad trades which orginiate from their psyche. OK. I am still searching for a book that can tool me for being a master trader. Sorry, this one did not do it for me."
1,The Worst Financial Book I Have Ever Read,"This book gave zero advice on trading. It is mainly written full of psychological advise (not bad) for someone who has poor emotional control. If this book is for you, you probably should see a psychiatist as well. For me, this was a total waste of my money buying it and my time reading it. If you have poor emotional control try it. If you are looking for practical advise on trading (as it's title suggests) you will not find it."
2,Better Value in the Psychology Section,"If you need motivation and inspiration and want to develop some mental techniques, go to the psychology section and buy something written by the proven winners like Anthony Robbins, Jose Silva, Dennis Waitley. They are a better value for your book buying dollars. There is not enough material in this book which is specific only to trading, which is not applicable to other areas of your life."
3,Psychology is the often overlooked intangible aspect of trading.,"Because it is unquantifiable and generally misunderstood by most traders and investors, psychology is the often overlooked intangible aspect of trading. Unlike the precise mathematical formulas used in technical analysis, we cannot easily reduce human behavior to a mathematical equation that can be plotted on a graph as a trend line or as a series of variables that we can examine in detail throughout history.That said, much current research in the social sciences is attempting to bring psychology more in line with mathematics for the precision that it gives to experimental methods. Mathematical methods are applied to behavioral science for the purpose of observing and comparing human behavior according to a set of strict numerical criteria - the only stable benchmarks that allow comparison of behavior from person to person and from time to time"
1,The Book of Platitudes,"I bought this book expecting to gain some insights into the psychology of trading. I received one big insight: Don't just research the markets - research books about the markets before buying! Mr. Kiev entreats us to: ""Find your weaknesses and eliminate them... Seek your psychological stumbling blocks and overcome them... Determine what restrains you from trading freely and well - and cast these things aside..."" And so on -ad infinitum; ad nauseum. Step two - the next logical step - the ""How"" to do these things is not a part of this book. Perhaps the author will publish a sequel: ""Ari Makes Even More Money."" Please do not buy this book."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one,"Way too general and vague to be useful. Any number of sources would be better even if one's main interest was the psychology of trading - for instance the articles in this field in ""Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities Magazine"". A better purchase bookwise would be either of Friedfirtig's books."
3,A So-So Book,"I am a professional day and swing trader. I didn't find this book to be particularly helpful because of the disorganized way in which it was written. Also it offers so many rules and guidelines that it is confusing to one as to which is more importnant. The author also tries to impress one with the profit size of his ""students"", throwing around figures like $20,000 to $30,000 in profits a day that his students or clients generate. I agree with another reviewer that these for the most part is meaningless as one needs to figure return on assets to really judge how well one is doing. I have read a much better book on trading psychology and this one really analyses why we make the mistakes so common in trading. Getting to the root of the problem has helped me to improve my trading. I am now in my third year in this business and hope to be in it for a lifetime."
2,"A contrarian view: Much hype, little info.","Dr. Kiev's book should be entitled:""(Fill in the Blank) to Win"".One could substitute ""Shopping"", or ""Collecting"" or ""Tennis"" for the word ""Trading"" and this book wouldn't be very much different in its content or approach. It is reminscent of a plethora of self-psych courses one sees so intensly advertised on cable TV and in certain periodicals.I don't mind motivational books. They can be quite helpful. As a trader who is considerably below the ""$300,000 profit per month trader"" Dr. Kiev so glibly uses as one of his examples, I found the book full of hackneyed cliches about successful attitudes overcoming all. In your dreams, maybe."
1,Mediocre,After you get passed all the hyped up reviews there is the book and that in essence is the problem.It is very mediocre and not nearly as good as some of the classic trading psychology books.
3,"good movie,not the best","i have seen al the 3 ""biG""indiana jones movie's and now i have bought 2 young indiana jones movie's,""daredevils of the desert""and ""treasure of the peacock's eye"". I will revieuw he second one,""daredevils""is a movie that is only action and exciting,nothing wrong with it.""treasure of the peacock""is a nice action movie,but the last 15 minutes are a little boring,that's true,but why must he always shoot and fight? now you can see how i must make a dissison. So,buy this movie,it's a nice action adventure with nice fight's.and migy a little boring end."
2,This episode is a real disappointment,"As a whole entity, Young Indy was a wonderful, brilliant series that deserved a much better fate than to be swept away after only a couple of seasons. However, every family has its black sheep, and this episode is decidedly the low point of the entire series.The first hour is okay, and one hopes that at some point, it may even take off and soar. It has the makings of a fun and exciting Indy adventure, but then it just wanders into pointless and emotionally unengaging territory. Sadly, the second hour drifts and is, well, just plain boring. The scenes on the island with the native tribe are endless, and the conclusion of the episode seems entirely out of character given the previous relationship of Young Indy and Remy. Not to mention, it's depressing.Yes, buy most of the other episodes of the series, they are wonderful! But, this episode is a dud."
3,"Good, but not best in Series","While I enjoyed this one alot, it's not the best of the series, which I watched when they were originally broadcast. It is, however, well worth adding to your collection. I highly recommend the Young Indiana Jones Series to parents and teachers trying to get kids interested in history.Most of the videos in this series take young Indy and plop him down in the middle of actual historical events, as a minor player (usually) but meeting famous and even pivotol people from the past, Lenin, Picasso, Pancho Villa and many others. Be warned that some of the episodes contain very grim scenes and film footage from WWI which may upset more sensitive viewers.One of the best series ever on TV, and I'm delighted to see them available on tape. I only wish they were on DVD becuase this is one series I will watch repeatedly. Plan to buy them all!"
3,Flannery delivers adventure.,"I rate this movie 3 stars. It's filled with action, adventure, and romance. From the trenches of Europe to exotic locations. It has daring fights just to retrieve a 140-carrot diamond. I would recommend this to all ages. Flannery delivers adventure."
2,The problem of The Problem of Information,"This book is boring, tedious, at times illogical, and almost always pretentious and tiresome. It's taking me on average 5 minutes per page to get through it, only to find that his points fall into four camps: 1) something I knew already, 2) something I didn't know and don't believe because I think it's illogical, 3) something I didn't know but don't think is relevant, and 4) something I didn't know, do think is relevant, and do believe. All in all, I think that Raber wrote this book in such a way that his language masks his sloppiness; I feel I'm wasting my time reading his work--Castells is much better--and I wouldn't recommend this book except as a literary cure for insomnia."
2,The Most Wanktastic Band Ever!,"If egos could kill, Emerson, Lake and Palmer would be mass murderers. This is likely the most bloodless, self-indulgent stuff I've ever heard. There's a lot of musical talent on display here, but it's mostly too obnoxious to enjoy. For example, they take a perfectly enjoyable Dave Brubeck number (""Blue Rondo a la Turk""), change the name to ""Rondo,"" muck it up with an overly complicated arrangement and add a super-extended drum solo that doesn't take long to wear out its welcome - but just keeps going. PPHHHLLLLUUUUUDDTTTT!!!!! Painfully dated."
5,covers hang nails and papercuts very well,"Perfect for those little places that bandages are awkward such as cuticles, hangnails, papercuts and on the face. I really liked it when I scratched my face because who wants to walk around with an ugly bandage on their face? Also seals out dirt, water and germs. I will never be with out it again. It does sting when applied but not too much as to avoid using it."
5,works great,"It stung when i first applied it, but it stayed on over two weeks. Thought about picking it off after a week, but then i decided to let it fall off when it wanted to."
4,Perfectly good liquid bandage,"This product applies and sticks to skin with no problems. Applied areas heal as fast as with normal bandage. The one thing you should note is the bad smell. I don't mind it myself, but everyone else I know takes issue if I go around them after being recently applied. The smell will go away in 10 minutes, maybe less."
2,"Eh, not worth my money","I was hoping to use this instead of band-aids for cuts and scrapes on my hands. As a stay-at-home mom, my hands are wet all the time - doing dishes, laundry, changing diapers, cooking, cleaning up messes, etc. Even water-proof band-aids don't stay on very long, or they get wet and uncomfortable. I thought this would be better, but it's not. First, it's smelly, like nail polish. Second, I have to wait for it to dry, which is inconvenient when chasing small children. Third, it doesn't stay on very long. After just a few hand-washings it peels right off and I'm back where I started. Not very useful."
5,Great format for a cook book,"Very useful book with instructions for hand-made, mixer-made, or machine-made breads in 3 different loaf sizes. Following are recipes using each kind of bread."
4,Easy to follow,"I have enjoyed baking from this book, but keep it mind that it's more for beginners. If you're looking for a more serious book, I would recommend going with Peter Reinhart's book on whole grain breads, which is more in-depth. However, if you just want to knock together some tasty bread (including the whole wheat cinammon raisin bread, which is divine) this is a good place to start. You do need to be a bit careful though, as not all of the recipes are 100% whole wheat."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"First of all, this is a lovely book with wonderful information.But the title ""Whole Grain Breads..."" implied to me that the recipes would incorporate only ""whole grains"" to the exclusion of white flours. Nearly every recipe I looked at had a large proportion of white flour.Oh well, Borders willingly accepted my return...I'm off to search again!"
5,"Wide variety of excellent recipes, outstanding layout","Way to go Beatrice! This is a very good and practical book. I own about a dozen other bread cookbooks, but this seems to be the one that I turn to most. All of the recipes I've tried have been a success. There is a wide variety of excellent recipes in the book, ranging from basic & everyday to impressive for entertaining. I feel that this book has something to offer everyone, since it has simple enough recipes for the beginner, but would not bore the more advanced baker who likes sourdoughs and more artistic types of breads. Another thing I like about this book is its layout and organization. I have found that some of my other bread books tend to be a bit confusing with their directions. Not this book - the instructions are VERY, VERY CLEAR. I believe that anyone who wants to make their own homemade bread should have a copy of this book. Get one TODAY before it goes out of print - or you'll regret it!"
2,Don't Judge This A Book By The Title!,"There is only one 100% whole grain bread recipe in this book. Most of them are less than 50% whole grain. If you want healthy bread recipes try ""Breadtime"" by Cheney or ""The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book"" by Robertson. Every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain. I doubt that most people considering a book titled ""Whole Grain Breads..."" are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients. With that being said I thought the book had some good recipes and was well written. Therefore, I am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none."
4,Whole Grain breads,"I have enjoyed trying breads from this book. I would not really say the recipes are whole-grain as written, since generally there is twice as much white flour and whole-grain flour, but I usually change the ratios when I use these recipes (2 c whole grain flour to 1 c white flour.) It also orders the ingredients for bread machines (putting the yeast last) which has been a bit annoying, but many modern bread books now are based on bread machines, so I can't complain too much. The sweet breads at the end of the book are wonderful. One of the reasons I got this book was because of the large number of Scandanavian recipes, and I have been very pleased with them. I also love the fact that there are three different loaf sizes. It is nice to try the sampler loaves without doing all the math! I usually end up doubling the recipe for the largest loaf since my family loves bread. I do recommend this book."
1,Disappointed-,"I was hoping this book would have recipes for healthy, whole grain breads. However, the recipes in this book are mostly white bread flour, with a minority of whole wheat or grain flour added in. This is not what I would term ""whole grain"" by any stretch of the imagination. The author makes several claims to how healthy ""whole grain"" recipes are, yet her entire book is filled with primarily white bread flour. This author needs a basic biochemistry science course. Waste of $$."
1,Not whole grain at all!,"Despite the title, most of the recipes in this book include only minimal amounts of whole grain flours. And to get multiple 'grains' in a recipe I'm supposed to buy whole grain cereals? The recipes included with my bread machine are far better than these. A waste of money for anyone who really wants to cook WHOLE GRAIN bread, not white bread with a few pieces of whole grain floating around."
2,Poor Quality,"It is unfortunate that Gerber has moved it manufacturing to a plant of such low quality. Their products used to be quite excellent.I ordered two of these, one for myself and one for a friend. One the first the thumbstud broke off after closing the knife a half dozen times, rendering it unlockable and quite useless. One the second the grinding at the butt of the blade was too heavy-handed and the locking spring falls off the side when pressure is applied to the spine of the blade. Really too bad, I had high hopes for these little knives."
4,Nice Pocket Carry,I have this knife's big brother but wanted something smaller to carry as the big boy drug on my pocket too much. Find this knife very handy and useful and although the steel in the blade is not as hi-tech as the Gerber Faribrun Covert folder it is very good. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND.
4,Nice knife,Very nice but a little smaller than I had expected. Still it is a very high quality knife and worth every penny.
3,Thank goodness it's on CD but what happened to the sound.,"I have been waiting for Madleen Kane on CD for a long time, so have to say thank you for this release. However, it is less than ideal. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the sound quality on some of the tracks is frankly shocking and spoils any enjoyment that is to be had. Also, what hasn't been commented on so far, is the fact that the tracks Forbidden love and Cheri were originally parts of a 'Suite' from the 'Cheri' album, and the decision to split them here and omit the other tracks (Fire in your heart and Secret love affair) is perverse to say the least - if it was a question of space, then removing the entirely pointless 'megamix' would have been an obvious start. Also missing from this release is Madleen's cover of 'Fever' which although showing up her vocal limitations does have one of the most beautiful orchestrations of the era."
5,"""She then became a polished diamond""","I still have Madleen's ""Cheri"" album. In the original format""Forbidden love"" was mixed with ""Secret love affair"" and ""Cheri"".One of my favorites back in the day was ""You & I"" from the same album. Then in the eighties ""Cherches pas"" and ""Fire in my heart""and ""You can"" were big dance hits. Definetely Madleen left her legacy in dico music history. Thanks Madleen for those beautifulsongs and thanks to TSR Records for bringing her back."
5,Great book to improve your Elo!,"This book is a great source for improving your play. Covers ideas by themes, like attack, defense, endgame... Tim Harding reveals ideas for selecting a move and calculation. Every improving chess player should own this gem."
2,Not very useful,"Maybe I was a bit late in reading this but I wanted to read a lot about storage, networks, SANs, NAS', and other technologies. This book had a lot of pages that really didn't get you into the guts of what was going on or even give you a good idea how to do it yourself.If you buy this book be prepared to do tons of self study to fill in the gaps left by improperly introduced technologies."
3,Okay Book,"Storage Networks was middle of road as far as networking books go. It tries to cover lots of theory mixed with a bit of implementation and with some vendor specific solutions. I suggest that if you are already well versed on storage mediums than to skip the first couple of chapters. The RAID explanation was really well done, and the graphics were concise. I felt that the book could have used a bit more practical how to instruction. More examples with Linux would have also been a nice. I would say if you can get a good deal on this book pick it up otherwise look elsewhere."
1,Unqualified author wrote about a highly technical topic,"The storage area network is a rapid evolving field that relates to many diverse field of IT, and a treatment of this area requires a deep understanding of many confusing concepts. Obviously the author doesn't qualify for this. Where are all those EMC, NetApp guys?"
4,Unique and valuable resource,"This is a well written book on designing and building high performance storage networks. It makes effective use of illustrations to illustrate tricky concepts like RAID striping, SCSI protocols, and the black magic of fiber-optic cables. What worked for me was that this book doesn't pander. It doesn't give a step-by-step walkthrough with screenshots. It gives you an overall view of the field and enough knowledge of terms and concepts so that you can understand vendors offerings yourself and make informed choices.I highly recommend this book to IT professionals looking to design and build high performance storage solutions."
2,Storage Networks?,"After reading over a hundred pages I'm still waiting to learn about SANs. While I enjoy the review on hard disk drives & Ethernet, that's not why I bought the book.But maybe I'm impatient? There's still 200+ pages left!"
4,A thorough description of bayesian statistics,"The book is a good introduction to bayesian decision theory. The plenty examples in the book are helpful in the understanding of the subject, but one could wish a more detailed description of the bayesian paradigm. People with little experience with statistics should maybe consider another book."
5,Best X-mas CD out there!,"My family has owned this CD for quite a while now, and I'd have to say it is my favorite Christmas CD I've heard. The music is beautiful and haunting and will take your breath away. I suggest it to everyone who wants to listen to something different this Christmas."
5,"Ambush: The Story of Bill Keys, Art Kidwell","I have hiked and backpacked thoughout Joshua National Park for several years and have heard and read bits and peices about the gunfight between Keys and Bagley. Art Kidwell has given me the ""big picture"" and has cleared up many myths and outright mistakes regarding one of the last gunfights of the ""old west."""
4,Pretty Decent,"Purchased for my husband - Very easy to store watches with the watch cushions being soft but not too soft and the watch slots are wide enough for Tags. The two compartments below the watch area are perfect for cuff links, tie clips and his wedding band (with room to spare). He is very pleased with the product."
4,Great for the Price,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas in 2010. It looks great from the outside. A metal hinge would have been nice. However, for the price it is a fantastic value. We've had it for the past two years and it still looks and functions great."
2,I returned it,"I was disappointed that I had to return this. The leather outside is nice (for the price), the inside has a good layout and the case overall is a good size.BUT... the top would not stay open and the lining was peeling off on the inside. For example, I stored bracelets in the front compartment, however I would have to keep one hand holding the lid up while picking out the one I wanted. If it wasn't for this, I would probably have kept it and given it 4 stars."
4,Great!,"I received the case on-time, and after some review I was a bit afraid of the quality; however, I must say its is really nice. I do however, consider the price a bit excesive, but, as I said it fits what I expected."
4,Watch / Jewelry Box Leather Storage Case,"Beautiful case - initially intended this as a birthday gift, but since I purchased another item I think I will be keeping this for myself :')"
5,great kitchen prints,This product arrived and better than I anticipated. I bought some black frames from Target and suddenly designer pictures for my kitchen wall. I decorated with fat chefs and these complimented them. Great bargain.
5,These pictures are a riot!,No kitchen should be without these! I put them in four black cheapo frames and it made a great gift...I am definitely doing this again when I'm stumped for a personal gift.
5,BobCat,Great Pics.Added black frames and the pics really came alive.Great for that Bistro look for the kitchen!!
5,GREAT FIND!,"I RECEIVED THESE VERY FAST, I WENT TO THE DOLLAR STORE AND BROUGHT SOME FRAMES AND PUT THEM IN THE FRAMES AND HUNG THEM ON MY WALL IN THE KITCHEN WITH ALL MY OTHER FAT CHEF DECOR! I HAVE HAD THESE FOR 2 YEARS NOW. THE PHOTOS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND COLORFUL AS WELL."
3,So boring,"It looks so boring I don't even want to look at it. So would feel bad making the kid try to go thru it. Not sure what's so great, and no grade recommendation writtened anywhere"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Almost all the words are a little too simple.Almost all he activities are a little too boring.This book is definitely low on my kids' list of things to work on around here.The best way to learn vocabulary really is to read books, preferably with a pack of post-its so you can go back and look up any words that you do not know."
5,Excellent Product,"My daughter used these books all through elementary and high school. She recently scored a 32 in reading on the ACT. They are excellent. We were doing so many wonderful activities: reading excellent books, nature study, etc. that she didn't mind spending a little time each day with this curriculum--in fact she seemed to find it interesting. She has an extremely advanced vocabulary now and has been accepted into an excellent nursing program. Highly recommended."
3,Know What Your Buying,"It wasn't clear to me that this is not a complete vocabulary/spelling curriculum. There are only about 15 lessons (the school year is close to 40 weeks). It also only has between 10 and 12 words per list. Last year our curriculum had 20 words per week.Also, this is not a spelling curriculum at all. There are no spelling tests included.However, I do like that the words are used in context. Every week has a short story using the word list.Would make nice support material, but not a full year curriculum."
1,COLECO NOT ATARI,you idiot I ordered an atari 2600 game it is a coleco vision game do not buy from this faker
4,Woah! A Balance!,"Finally they've struck a balance between spacey and rocked-out. I completely enjoyed Kid A and Amnesiac, but I longed for some rocking Radiohead in the midst of all the bleeps, blops, and strung out madness that was their experimentation. Here we seem to have found a balance with many electronic beats with an always-flowing shout from Yorke. Favorites as of now include Sail to the Moon, Myxamatosis, There there, Punchup..Wedding, and the rest are not far behind. Entire album is awsome - no skip songs and no BS as usual. Go grab it - it's Radiohead at their best."
4,Hail To The Thief [actually a 4.5],"As Radiohead's return to recording after almost 2 years, Hail To The Thief (HTTT) is an amazing work. After first hearing almost three months ago, when an unmastered copy leaked to the internet, I must say I was blown away. A few reasons why:2+2=5. Wow, Guitars - rockin' ones. Something lacking in the past two albums.We Suck Young Blood. Haunting. Looming. Beautiful. Hand claps.There There. Great solo.I Will. Perfection.A Wolf At The Door. Quickly becoming one of my favorite songs.The only thing that really irks me about this album is The Gloaming. That song, for some reason, cannot click with me. But other than that, this is a solid album and I reccomend buying it.So do it.Right now.No, now.C'mon! :]"
5,We are accidents waiting to happen,"Radiohead is back, and Hail to the Thief could not be a more perfect fit in their succession of magnificent work. Once again they prove themselves to be the most innovative band around by pushing their style to new heights. Blending electronica with experimental indie rock results in quite a fabulous listen. This album covers the gamut of emotions from infectious grooves (A Punchup at a Wedding, There There), to very intense rock (2+2=5, Sit down. Stand up.), to more relaxed somber moments (Sail to the Moon, Scatterbrain), and very eerie moments (We suck Young Blood). The album closer, 'A Wolf at the Door', could quite possibly be the best song that I have ever heard. If you listen to this album with headphones on, you'll be completely blown away, but not quite as blown away as if you had seen them perform live. Give it a shot...right now!"
2,A disappointment,"During the sessions for this album, the word was that this was going to be Radiohead's return to guitar-based rock. Well, no such luck. Hail To The Thief is a continuation of the experimental leanings heard on Kid A and Amnesiac, but with diminishing returns. The band is still staying away from anything resembling traditional verse-chorus-verse songs, and your enthusiasm for the album will be in direct proportion to your tolerance for the direction their music has taken. Even so, this is not a strong set of songs; the music is simply unmemorable, with little to draw the listener in and stay in the mind. Atmospheric and impressionistic, but ultimately self-indulgent and snooze-inducing, it's their weakest album."
1,Another wet blanket . . . .,"pulled over our collective heads. I'm tired of reading reviews about how ""important,"" ""deep,"" and ""meaningful"" the last three Radiohead albums have been. The bottom line is that they are meandering, unstructured, self-indulgent assemblies of drivel. Each album sounds more and more like they've run out of good ideas for melodies and hooks. Or they are playing a massive prank on the critics to see how long people will continue to laud this [garbage]. Time to move on and find another ""greatest rock & roll band ever."""
4,"not the best, but still good","it's not ok computer .. it's not the bends.. but that doesn't mean its a bad album..almost every radiohead album has a different feel to the others ( with the exception of kid a and amnesiac ) . in my opinion, they took all the experiences they had with those previous outings, and used it creating this.. as i said.. not a bad thing..i'm not saying this merely because i am a fan, but because it's a great album.. at first, i'd skip a few songs, finding them boring, but after a few listens, the whole thing grew on me.. ( had a similar experience with kid a )in closing, i think there is something for everyone to like here, old fans and new... it'll grow on you too"
3,Pretty good...,"Radiohead are artists first and musicians second. This album seems very spiritual and emotional, but it's not the easiest to listen to. Listeners with short attention spans may give up and groups of three or more may decide they'd rather hear something a little less depressing.This album is really good if you listen to it a few times alone and read the lyrics. It does take some patience. I also think that you have to be in the right mood to appreciate it.That being said, I really don't think it sounds as good as some of their older stuff. Are they afraid that if they sound good people will think they're selling out? You can be creative, artistic, AND pleasing to the ears like OK Computer.It seems unanimous that Radiohead are like the best band ever, but why? I'm sorry; I like Radiohead, but like the White Stripes, they are totally overrated."
2,Disappointing,"Undeniably Radiohead is one of the most innovative and interestings bands around. But they seem to get more and more slack and self-satisfied -- almost smug -- with each record. Here a few good tunes, particularly the opening and closing tracks, get lost in a smorgasboard of mediocre music, unintelligible lyrics, and excessive production. Back to the Bends please!"
5,Yes! Hail to the thief!,"Wow! this album truly blew me away! The best ive heard since OK Computer. More then what i was expecting from them. It sounds a little like OK Computer, but better. They deliver 14 new songs that all sound amazing! i recomend this album to any fan of theirs. They will not be dissapointed!"
3,Porcupine Tree Does It Better,"Radiohead is a better than average band but they sound quite a bit like Porcupine Tree and it always blows my mind that Radiohead gets all the press while the superior Porcupine Tree gets very little. Proof that it's all about politics. Anyone who likes Radiohead would do well to listen to the real McCoy...start with In Absentia and work backwards. Lightbulb Sun, Stupid Dream, and Signify are all deliciously tasty."
3,Less than OK Computer or In Rainbows,"Doesn't quite match the crisp songs and exhilarating guitar sounds a la Soundgarden or Smashing Pumpkins. OK Computer and In Rainbows are classic like an ""A"", but I can only give ""Half to Thief"" a B- at best. Maybe if I'm just completing my collection, but not as essential as the others."
1,Buy this CD if you want to be miserable...,"Hail To The Theif is complete garbage. If I could have given it 0 stars, then I would have. I can't stand hearing another person talk about Radiohead's supposed brilliance. They have no talent. Save yourself before it is too late and buy some REAL music."
1,A little dull,"Frankly I thought this album was dead boring. Then again I don't really like Radiohead in the first place. If you do like them I guess you'd probably like this album, but if you prefer your music a little more lively it might not be for you."
2,Ouch,"Okay so I bought this album because people that I thought had good musical taste liked it. Unfortunately, as much as I tried to ""appreciate"" it or I guess meditate admist the droning voice and lyrics that don't go anywhere or do anything, the album is simply boring. They are doing a nice job going against the system or whatever, and in the process they are making some hypnotic and down right revolutionary garbage."
3,hmmm,"If you were hoping for a return to something like 'The Bends,' this isn't it. Here's hoping for the next go around."
5,Radiohead has done it again.,"I am a big radiohead fan, and have been looking forward to this album for a long while. It does not dissapoint. Like Kid A and Amnesiac, it is not very listener friendly, and takes repeated listenings to fully apreciate. This album is haunting, the melodys burrow under your skin hitting all the right spots. get it."
5,1984 is reality,"The disc opens with the urgent 2+2=5 which is taken directly out of 1984 the novel. Yorke gets anxious and screams ""You have not been paying attention!"" with thick guitars squalling behind it.Dropping right into sit down stand up as yorke portrays big brother singing innane orders. All and all this is defenitely there most political album rather than Kid A which used more metaphors. Hail to the thief (taken from the protestors signs when bush was sworn into office)is a direct statement. The music as usual is very sonic and matures with every release. This being there most ambitious with full rock and idm/experiemental songs. Do yourself a favor and listen to the words. The beautiful we suck young blood is brilliant. ..."
3,Same old same old.,"Another good radiohead CD, but the words ""endless droning"" come to mind when listening to it.If you put all their CD's in a CD changer, they would be almost indistinguishable from one another.And what's with the annoying sounds they include in their songs. There's little electronic beeps and pops, in one song you get the joy of hearing the sound of a needle reaching the end of a record for the entire song. More annoying than innovative.But if you like Radiohead, you won't be disappointed."
2,"no rock, no swing, just... sound","There's a lot to listen to in this collection, but it's an unrewarding experience unless one seeks the morose, flabby, throbbing sensations that are offered up, cut after cut. Nifty and quirky passing sounds and unengaging verbal blather wash by to mostly enervating and surprisingly unpleasing effect. Despite the prerelease hype desperately describing this as the hoped-for ""rock"" and ""song-based"" work from Radiohead, it's not. The ""band"" continues to produce self-referential sound that is cliche from a general, modernist standpoint, but presumably ""new"" and ""original"" in pop. Klee, Kandinsky, Beckmann, Nolde, and Ensor are painterly antecedents for what, appearing today, comes across as angst-y, and demoralizing sound that may be music but is not rock. These artistes take themselves way too seriously. Weak even on its own terms."
2,Greatness Streak comes to an End,"Don't get me wrong...this is a good album. But, it falls short of the great albums that started from the Bends to this point. I enjoy the music ....but it falls flat compared to those. The highlights are There There, Where I End, ScatterBrain, A Wolf at the Door, Sail to the Moon & I'll throw in 2+2. But they are few and far between and not as soul stirring as their other work. The low spot of the disc was We Suck young Blood- A boring ditty that contains about 10 seconds of genius during a tempo break, otherwise your stuck with some clapping and not so good ramblings.This is actually a 3 Star review..but it needed to be a notch down to drop the hype reviews."
4,Spell Check,It's spelled Myxomatosis (the CD has it right) and it is a disease introduced to feral rabbits to reduce their population.The best new band of the last twenty years continues to weave its magic without the aid of a spell checker.Happy Trails
4,challenging and rewarding,"a hypno-sonic escapade that travels through bizarre and soothing territories before bringing you back to your normal self, a bit transformed.I like the surprises of Radiohead, especially with regard to being able to decipher different nuances with each new listen.This band is certainly pushing many envelopes wide, wide open..."
5,Radiohead's best work to date,"From start to finish, this is Radiohead's best cd. I'm not sure my words will do it justice. I would just say listen to ""Where I End and You Begin."" Then read the lyrics carefully, and you'll get a feel for the brilliance of possibly the most talented band on the planet. This album is certainly best if you listen to it all the way through on a nice system (preferably headphones), and read the lyrics as you go. But, it's also the kind of album you can throw into your car stereo and groove to while you're driving around town."
2,Still not OK,"OK Computer still stands as Radiohead's masterpiece. Amnesiac was a nice try but really nowhere close, and this one misses the mark even more. Aside from the stupid premise that this album somehow has to do with some obsessive disenchantment over the U.S. 2000 election (get over it!), the songs just don't measure up overall. There are a couple of good-approaching-great tracks, but that's about all. Whatever that stuff was that you guys were smoking when you did OK Computer - get some more of that...."
1,Awful album from a once-great band,"Radiohead's last album Hail to the Thief has to be the worst album they ever did. Despite the fact I am a Republican and Bush supporter, I gave this album a fair chance seeing as I liked its four predecessors The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and of course, Amnesiac. However, this album is a mess. The band are tired, uninspired, bland and the material is forced. 2 + 2 = 5, Wolf at the Door and There There sounds like something babies would come up with. I can see why this album was a flop when released because the material was boring and also competing against R&B great Luther Vandross and Metallica's St Anger didn't help matters. I tried listening to this album four times for it to grow, just wouldn't cut it so I sold it. Buy any other Radiohead disc except this album!"
1,not good,"Don't waste your money; just whiny boring slow unoriginal [...].The bends is good, ok computer is ok, the others aren't too great, but this one just flat out [...].Listen college students, you don't have to pretend to like Radiohead. Listening to Radiohead doesn't make you an intellectual.And Radiohead is no longer trying to make good music. They are just trying to make weird obscure artsy sounding stuff like many other bands nowadays with way to much leftist lyrics tossed in.Radiohead soldout a long time ago if you ask me and i really wish they would stop making this [...]."
1,Hail to the ultimate thieves of the '90s!,"That's what they were and are! All they do is rip people off by putting out this crap and having Thom Dorke go onto message boards and create unwarranted buzz for their ""new"" records. Don't buy this if you value humanity. I'd rather listen to Core by STP and that record is usually only ok if you're into date rape."
3,Better Than Previous,But nothing will top OK Computer.Nothing.Every band has its masterpiece.That was it.
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"I've been a Radiohead fan since I saw them on their first tour, when they opened for Belly (what ever happened to Belly?), but I'm enjoying their music less and less. I just can't get into this album at all. I've listened to the album maybe 5 times, and I wouldn't recognize one single tune if you played it for me now. They just don't stick in my head they way that songs like ""Karma Police"" and pretty much any tune from The Bends.I'd say, buy the album if you're a die-hard fan. You probably already own it by now if you're a die-hard fan anyway. If you really thought OK Computer and The Bends were great, go buy the Coldplay CD instead. You'll be much happier with your purchase."
2,Simply Dreadful,"I'm a big Radiohead fan so it pains me to say this, but.... this collection of tracks is the most uninteresting, unlistenable, monotonous music I could ever imagine a band like Radiohead recording. There's not an interesting track on this whole album. Boring from start to finish. Don't bother with this one. If you're a Radiohead fan Hail To The Thief will only diminish your regard for the band. Pass this one by."
2,I don't get it,"This album is for fans only, although i don't know how they have any left.. unless all these reviewers giving them 4's and 5's are secretly record label executives. I mean honestly, how hard would it be to make ""backdrifts"" or ""the gloaming""? Nothing but incoherent computer noises. Most of the other songs are just tuneless and depressing. You can call it genius all you want but like one reviewer said, Radiohead fails on the most basic level, which is that music has to be enjoyable. Ok Computer was thier peak and they know it. They're not even trying anymore."
1,oh poo,"is this the great white hope?oh boy.western culture, for gods sake, point the canon at yr head and pull the friggin string."
2,Radiohead R.I.P.?,"I give up - sorry guys. I absolutely loved OK Computer. Being somewhat disappointed with Kid A (other than ""Everything..."" and ""Disappear..."") I went out and bought Amnesiac in the hope of something better - no luck. Not having much luck with this new album either, although ""Scatterbrain"" and ""Wolf"" come close to what I liked so much on OK Computer. Does this make me too mainstream? If so then I guess Radiohead have lost a fan."
2,Half-baked.,"A disappointment. The best song is easily ""There there"", while the rest is mostly uninspired, meandering filler. Supposedly a mesh of their more recent experimental style and their original guitar rock flavors, the album can't hold a candle to any of ""Kid A"", ""Amnesiac"", or ""The Bends"". Radiohead was once one of the best bands in the world. What went wrong? Boring."
1,I've given up on Radiohead,"I will start out this review by saying I think OK Computer is probably one of the best albums of the last decade. However this CD, along with Kid A, has got to be the worst. It is a collection of incoherent meaningless noise. Anyone who thinks this is art is also the person who thinks someone is a genious because they can't understand them. I am not opposed to experimentation, but some experiments are failures; and these ""songs"" (much like an ugly baby)are something only their creator would love. What a disappointment."
1,"Revolutionary, best of last 2000 years","These guys are so expirimental. Thet are geniuses. I am special too because I like them. In fact, I am better than you because I ""get it""."
3,Not as good as it should be,"this album, being radiohead's sixth attempt, is below par considering the past performances of the band. although still a good album i was expecting much more (being a radiohead fan).however, this album does have many good points including 2+2=5, there there and a wolf at the door. it does have plenty of let downs though, go to sleep is a bends song and where i end and you begin has been stolen from u2.my main criticism of this album is that, unlike other radiohead albums, it doesn't have an ""identity"". it just chops and changes without much success, and although the songs are on the whole very good, it fails as a album.in my opinion radiohead have under achieved, 3 stars is probably a bit harsh because the album does have some very good moments, but radiohead can do better.....much better"
4,"Thoughtful, creative and risky","To hold a new work of art up to a past work and expect it to match is, from the start, close-minded. It is refreshing to see artists push themselves and explore new areas, while keeping in touch with their artistic fundamentals and talents.After plunging into new and unfamiliar waters with promising results on ""Kid A"" and ""Amnesiac"", Radiohead has fantastically accomplished their search for a more evolved and exciting sound with ""Hail to the Thief"". They have found an awesome new level to project from; one that incorporates their past achievements and failures, and then molds them into an impressive portfolio showing much thought, creativity, and risky, yet wise, musical decisions.""Hail to the Thief"" is an excellent album, and the time and effort put into its creation by Radiohead will keep people listening, appreciating, and rocking."
5,Disorganized for a reason,"A few months ago I began to feel dissatisfied with my music collection. HTTT was the first album I got to try to correct this feeling.This album seems very disorganized to me, but that serves their purpose well in trying to analyze world events of the past few years. Although the title seems to focus on Bush, the album addresses politics in general and how the world seems to be falling apart. Hail jumps between several musical styles from acoustic to electric and soothing to frightening. There isn't really anyway to lump this album into one catagory. It is a great album with some powerful music and even more powerful lyrics. Not as good as OK Computer but I think it balances better than their last two albums. My favorite song from this album is Wolf at the Door."
1,What happened?,These guys have made some phenomenal music. This one is a bore!Overrated *clap clap clap clap clap*Overrated *clap clap clap clap clap*!
4,1st listen - 3/5 stars...after 2nd listen - 4/5 stars...,"...and it could be 5/5 stars by the fourth or fifth listen. It seems like Radiohead are trying to get back to the days of OK Computer and The Bends, but they have been so warped from the creation of Kid A and Amnesiac, that they had a bit of trouble trying to get back. I must say that when I first heard 'There There' (the first single), I nearly jumped for joy as I heard guitars instead of keyboards. Now don't get me wrong -- I have grown to love Kid A and Amnesiac like all of their previous albums, but they were so entrenched in keyboards that I forgot (at times) that Radiohead is still a guitar band at heart. I won't run down the tracks and analyze each one, but I would definitely say that this is an album worth purchasing. It will be very interesting to see where Radiohead goes from here."
2,Unfortunately Radiohead may have gone a little too far...,Unfortunately Radiohead may have gone a little too far this time. On hearing this album for the first time I wasn't impressed. On saying that I never go on first impressions of an album but on listening to it again for a second and third time something seems missing. There are a few higlights that remind you of songs past such as 'Go to Sleep' & 'There There'. It feels like I have to work to hard at understanding and liking this album. Gone are the days of Thom Yorke's powerful whining in tune. Now he sounds like a choir boy hitting puberty! And to finish off I'm not impressed by the album cover artwork compared with previous masterpieces.
3,Get the normal version,"I had all the songs from this CD already. They are great. This is maybe one of the best albums they have come out with so far. Every song is just great. BUT, i ordered the special edition because I was expecting it to be as good as the Amnesiac Limited edition cd which was actually made to look like a library book. Sadly this special edition is terrible. I can beleive this is a radiohead cd. The Cd package is of very poor quality. The whole thing looks like it will fall apart. I am a designer and I have to say this special edition is not worth the extra $$$$. Get the normal version."
5,2+2 = 4 in this case,"Gold here! 2+2=5, Backdrifts, There There and Punch up at a Wedding are highlights. But this is a great collection. Best Radiohead since Ok Computer and that is saying something!!"
3,Three stars as far as a Radiohead album is concerned,I like this album.Just seems like they wer ebowing to rpessure and trying to get back to pleasing the label execs.Keep on doing what you do best--experiemental pop. Make it spacey again!
3,Ho hum,"I'm beginning to lose my faith in this band. This is even a step down from the less-than-stellar ""Amnesiac"". It starts off well enough with three incredible tracks that remind the listener of what once made this band great. They actually sound like a rock band on ""2+2=5"" and ""Sail to the Moon"" is beautiful, with Thom Yorke's voice as fine as ever. After that, every track is just boring and pointless. The band just doesn't know how to write songs anymore. There are even two ridiculous attempts at pop songs (""Go To Sleep"", ""There There""), but the band has lost their ear for melody. That's not to say there aren't any other notable moments on the album, but they are few and far in between. I avoid calling the album a disappointment only because at least the band is trying something new, even returning to their ""OK Computer""-era sound on a few songs."
3,Radiohead are back in form.,"Another Radiohead release that depending on what mood your in could go either way in opinions i personally like around half the tracks on the record but it gets a bit tireing at times, i suppose it depends on whether you are more into past or present Radiohead while i'm only into the present Radiohead i cant help feeling this is slightly pretentious whilst been creative it seems to drown in it's own ability but other than that there are quite a few stand out tracks such as backdrifts, go to sleep and myxomatosis, any fan of the more present radiohead material is more likely to appreciate this and enjoy every second of it though in my opinion Radiohead are a very average band but a more pre-eminent average band."
2,Neither a masterpeice or a total piece of trash,"I think too many people are acting like mindless lemings nad giving this album 5 stars. There are also too many people saying it is horrible. In my opinion, it is an incredibly ambitious album, but is just much too unpleasant to listen too. There is more sonic experimentation AND rocking, but the problem is that Radiohead has completely lost their soul. It is very intelligent and they definitely put lots of work into it, but all of the abstraction leaves me ice cold and with the feeling that my brain will explode. The problem is that, as with OK Computer, Radiohead is using almost exclusively their brains, and ignoring their most overlooked assets: their souls and emotions."
1,CD Not Playable,"Thanks to the RIAA and the VERY restrictive ""anti- piracy"" measures used on this CD, I was forced to return the CD to the store (For store credit, as the CD was opened....) due to the CD not being playable on my computer, or mp3 player (the reason i purchased the CD, and which are both legal uses of the CD. The anti-""piracy"" measures are very extreme on this CD. I use ""piracy"" in quotes as I was not even allowed to use the CD legally."
2,Is the experiment working anymore?,"Is it just me, or are these guys a bit overrated? Either that, or they're believing their reviews too much. How about writing some songs, guys? Everytime I buy a new one of their cd's I think my speakers are starting to go downhill. Not even that interesting anymore. Save your money."
4,In tune with the times..,"Just finished listening to Hail To The Thief for the first time. Mixed emotions about it, melancholic to uplifting at times. The lyrics are seemingly powerful, but needs more listening to get used to. I am going to listen to it again, but after peeking inside this cd for about 40 minutes, I am glad I bought it.Right now, I am giving it anywhere from 3.5 to 4 stars - I am sure that will change soon. It's been always that way for me with Radiohead.And kudos for boycotting Clear Channel Corporation. Glad you guys have the backbone to stand up to a bunch of hypocrites."
2,Been trying to Like Radiohead for years.....,"I'm interested in good rock music. I take recommendations, such as these on Amazon, and I make CD selections based on hype. Radiohead is one of the most heralded bands on the planet, if not THE #1 Rock band. Why? I can't figure it out.OK Computer was a terrific album. It was different. It was enjoyable. But everything else Radiohead has done just bores me to death. Don't get me wrong. I'm not coming on here to bash Radiohead beacuse I don't like them, and I have something against them. I honestly can't figure out what the big deal is. I've found myself listening to their albums, especially this one, over and over again, trying to find something I like. I can't. I just can't find something to like.Hail to the Theif... boring. Mediocre at best. There is not one song on the album that fully captures my attention. Radiohead has done this all before, and it's just making me Yawn this time around. Sorry, it's the truth. My take on the matter."
3,Uh oh...Politics and Radiohead,"Being a huge Radiohead fan, I pretty much follow them blindly. Even their bad songs are 90 percent better than the majority of today's music. However, as the title alludes to, this album has a political tone to it and is very disconcerting. Being a political conservative, I have a problem with some of the overtly political songs like ""I Will"" and ""2+2=5"". There are some beautiful songs here, like ""There, There"", ""Sail to the Moon"", and ""Myxamatosis"", but they don't compensate for the band's political views. I just wish music and politics would stay separate, like the church and state."
2,Thin and Hypocritical,"Been a big Radiohead fan for several years now, but I have to say this is a weak effort. Too much posturing and white-bread indignation, too little originality. If you're rich and you want to be righteous, try spreading the wealth."
4,Who is the typical Radiohead fan?,"I purchased this CD after reading an article about Radiohead in Time magazine. I'm 38, have 3 young kids and live in the suburbs, and I don't get exposed to good new music as much as I would like. As I always liked alternative music back in the early 80's, I decided to give this CD a try. It took a few listens, but this is really great stuff; very different, intelligent, and musical. I have since purchased the Bends and ok computer, which are even better. I would love to talk about this music with others, but I don't know a single other person who is familiar with them. If you fit my profile, and want a different sound, give Radiohead a try."
4,NOT THEIR BEST,"didn't have the punch of Kid A or OK, wasn't as captivating.but, hey, it's radiohead, and, I mean, what else is there?PLEASE WRITE TO ME IF YOU THINK THERE IS ANY BAND TO COMPARE TO RADIOHEAD. or anything else to listen toI've been in south america for 10 years, no radio or other media. found out about radiohead from a New Yorker.The last time I was so turned on by a popular band was Talking Heads, (the minutemen the fall, etc.)"
2,Past their peak,"Radiohead were an amazing band in the ninties but are hard to like today. Hail to the Thief was just too hard to get into. Most of the songs seemed predictable and I just wished Thom Yorke would spit out what he was singing and quit dragging it out, it made it real boring to listen to. The music isn't anything special at all, it comes off as if Radiohead have been stripped down to a conservative joyless band making the present songs sound repetative and dull. There still are a few songs worth hearing that remind you of what Radiohead used to be, but that band is gone leaving the listener with a bitter old man nobody wants to get stuck talking to. This disc is just for the hardcore fans who don't mind being force-fed a sub par only to crap out, in their minds, genius."
2,"Oh, please....","The most overrated rock album of 2003. This talented band now seems more interested in being provocative and 'in-your-face' than being musical, and it's a shame. If you want to hear Radiohead at its peak, check out The Bends (1995) and OK Computer (1997). Don't waste your money on this tripe."
4,A solid followup,"This is a great add-on to Kid A and Amnesiac: in the same vein, but different enough that you know they are exploring new ground. Most songs stand well on their own, but also work well in the album as a whole. I was reminded, especially on track 6, of that old 80's band ""Simple Minds"". Great bass licks, which I've always been a sucker for. If you liked the previous two albums, this one's a cinche."
2,It's alright,I Finally got a chance to sit&Listen to this Album From RadioHead&I gotta admit not much has changed me about them&there styling of Music.they are alright&have some Moments but I don't really feel much in there vocals nor there songwriting.I prefer some of there Older stuff a bit more but nothing really holds my attention.I like things in a Hit&Miss way with Radiohead.
3,overrated,"Like all of Radiohead's releases since OK Computer, this album is overrated. While not bad by any means, people should actually listen to this album instead of taking critics' opinions as gospel. This band is a critic's darling, let's be honest. They could tell ghost stories on an album, and critics would consider it groundbreaking."
2,Radiohead dissapoints,"I was feverishly anticipating this album, and when I bought I didn't like what I heard. I find Radiohead's music very accessible and can like one of their songs on the first listen. But this album does not make me happy like other Radiohead albums do. It doesn't really have on objective, I hate to say this but it sounds like Thom Yorke, the Greenwood Bros. and company are starting to go pop. This album is like non-convincing theatre rock. It tries to sound really dark and dramatic but it's not. It doesn't sound like any effort or emotion was put into this, like it was thrown together in a couple of weeks and put it on sale.Hopefully, Radiohead will ante up a little the next album.PS: Awesome title, Dean 2004!!!!!!"
2,More fools gold,"Please people... stop trying to convince yourself that this is a good album and worth the hard earned dough you paid for it. Now i have nothing against Radiohead, i loved Ok computer too, but more than half of this electro-dreck should never have made the final cut. Unless you're all really masochists i recommend you get ""Antenna"" by Cave in instead."
1,Still a Creep.,"Are we as stupid as they think we are? Can y'all hear the lyrics in that frumpy accent?A pasty, emaciated, walleyed Euro warbles gibber-jabber to an imitation Massive Attack rhythm and you cows hail him a genius while he hails your president a thief. What am I missing?What are you missing?York should put to pasture alongside Pearl Jam, the Dixie Chicks, Hollywood, and France.Shut up and sing."
1,Utter crap,This CD is a useless waste of plastic. Unlistenable is another good description. The Thief referred to in the title is Radiohead - they stole $14 out of my wallet for this crap. Music for people who hate music.0 stars
1,You woke me up for this?,"Come on Radiohead, my time is valuable. I don't like being duped into buying rubbish like this by those deluded, self-satisfied music critics. You're on thin ice Thom. You better make the next album worth my while or I'll be starting a new anti-radiohead site in the near future. It will most certainly talk about your selling out to the music industry, and how for the last fours you have been lazily resting on your laurels and relying on your loyal fan base to buy whatever mish-mash you decide to put out there. It's time for honesty, and some real soul searching. If this is the best you can do then you guys should stop making albums, because I for one will not stand for your half-hearted efforts."
1,radiohead is extremely overrated,"this is a band that had a wonderful single over a decade ago called Creep. it was beautiful. then they went art rock and everything that they have released after that has been painfully dull, overbloated, overhyped, extremely simply, and amaturish. radiohead is a great way to make yourself want to hurt someone or go into a coma. they are way overrated. they are talented, but rarely use that talent. just because something is popular doesn't mean that it is good. it just means that most of the idiots agreed on something. radiohead is a one hit wonder"
2,good grief,"I have a feeling the perception of this album in many cases has to do with whether someone fell in love with their early sound or not. This band seemed to write actual SONGS up through OK Computer. Kid A and Amnesiac had much self-indulgent noodling, but still delivered the occasional gem. Hail to the Thief simply discards anything accessible and takes the worst noodling aspects of the previous two albums to the extreme. Sure it's wonderfully produced but it just doesn't grab me in any way. The songs are generally agitated and dissonant, but with no melodies to allow Thom's vocals to go straight to the heart--a quality I saw as the hallmark of this band.I guess Capitol is forcing radio to play the first couple singles, because they certainly can't be connecting with anyone on their own merits. Which isn't to say they have to be a radio-friendly band, but Electioneering from OK Computer sounds like a bubblegum hit next to this stuff."
3,Enough already...,"One CD full of ""beeeeeeeeeep-hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm-oooommmmmmm"" is enough, don't you think? Are they trying to get out of their recording contract or something?Radiohead is one of the more talented groups around and I'll admit that a few of these ""tunes"" are OK but I want more than this for my hard-earned cash.Please fellas, give us all a break and make some other kinds of sounds with your instruments."
4,Not Radiohead's best,"For 1, buy the regular edition, the limeted isn't all that good.This is a cd of great songs, but it dosn't seem to be all one album like Kid A or Amnesiac or OKC. It combines all of them, which makes it harder to listen to from start to finish. Great moments enclude, The Gloaming, and Punch up through wolf. But if you are new to Radiohead, start with OKC, then Kid A, ect ect. You will enjoy listening to this and remember it as Radiohead's only pop album (hopefully.) So pick it up!If you want a sample, download these:Were i end and you beginScatterbrainMyxomatosisWolf At the Door"
1,Man this sucks,This cd sucks bad. its horrible. slow and steady dosent win the race hear. it sounds like one huge long song. the music videos are really bad. i think this could win one of the worst bands alive award. that or ok computer. be free to e-mail me if u wont to argue about it.
3,only listened to cd twice,"here's my deal: i WAS a huge radiohead fan. then Kid A came out. i hated and still hate Kid A.i dont know where the band that made OK Computer and the Bends went when they made Kid A but this seems to be right on with the rest of the reviews as having more similarity with OK Computer. this is a good CD so far. I've listened to it twice. it's kind of depressing. try not to take any sleeping pills while listening to it.overall, i like it. if you loved OK Computer like I do (i consider it one of the best rock albums of all time) you MAY like this cd. will you love it though? i doubt it."
3,Just because it's Radiohead doesn't mean it's great,"Ok, I'll be the first to agree with all the accolades heaped on Radiohead's previous work, especially ""OK Computer"". I bought Hail to the Thief based on some rather glowing reviews on Amazon.com and in the music press. Frankly, I don't get it. I've listened to the cd about 10 times and nothing really stands out. It's creative, however it will probably just end up collecting dust in my cd rack. It's my opinion that some fans just want to say it's great just because it's Yorke and company. I'm a huge Clash fan, but I'm not ashamed to say ""Combat Rock"" was mediocre at best."
4,No Copy Protection,"I really don't have anything new to say about this CD, but I would like to point out that contrary to one of the other reviewer's statements, my copy of this CD did not have any copy protection. I put it on my computer with iTunes fine, and I listen to it all the time on my iPod."
3,Stupid Copy Control Program!!!,"My brand new disc i bought is a big sufferer of Audio Clippings, especially on ""There There"" & as we all know, once you buy a new cd & open it, you're screwed. Now i have to go to iTunes & buy the tracks that aren't messed up again. I would've rated the album higher if it wasn't for that cheese... My advice is just go to iTunes for this album. Three of my friends bought 'Hail To the Thief' also & they all have the same problems in the exact same spots of the recording. Could we get a re-issue or something? Anyways, good band still. It's not their fault."
4,"very, very good","this cd is quite awesome. the first track (""2+2=5"") starts off with the guitar getting plugged in, and that's pretty rad. the whole cd is good, but i wouldnt say its as good as ""The Bends"" or ""Ok Computer"". either way its a good cd. if your a die-hard radiohead fan, get the special edition one. it has a free poster and it comes in its own unique way.(youll know what im talking about if you get it.) if your just a fan that likes ""creep"" and/or ""optomistic"", then get the normal edition."
2,and a half,"Ever since Ok computer and the ridiculous amount of praise and hype it got, Thom and crew beleive they don't have to try anymore. They write a few decent songs per album then fill the rest in with avante garde ""soundscapes"" and other awful mood peices. I doubt most people here ever really paid attention to electronic music such as Autechre, Massive attack or Krawftwerk before they heard Kid a. But as soon as Radiohead does it, its considered genius. Better run out and buy all those Aphex twin albums. Hail to the Thief isnt as electronic as thier previous 2 overated albums. Theres more of a Tom waits smokey piano ballads vibe to it. Theres also a few straight ahead rock songs here, 2+2=5, Go to sleep, There There, all of which are good. A Punchup at a wedding and A wolf at the door are the only other 2 tracks i would consider songs. The rest is for those who liked ""treefingers"" and ""pulk/pull revolving doors"", not me."
3,good but not too good,"I like Radiohead and have been following the band eversince I discovered OK computer which to my like continues to be their best, I see a lot of 5 star ratings but as much as I like this new album besides the fact that it took me the longest to digestI still dont consider it 5 stars because simply its not the besthear it yourself, after all its just my opinion."
2,Fans Deserve Better,"This album proves that it is possible to blow your money on a Radiohead CD. Radiohead is a unique band that can play two completely different styles of music (prog rock and experimental) exeptionaly well. Unfortunatly, this album proves that they cannot bridge this gap. There are three good songs on this ablum; ""there there"", ""where i end and you begin"", and ""a wolf at the door."" All the rest of the songs are [garbage]. For most bands, this would be an ok album, but I expect more from Radiohead."
4,Great!,"This is, in my humble opinion, their best work since OK Computer (however, there other stuff wasnt that bad either). A nice listen when your going to sleep."
1,Nothing worth keeping,"Terrible Terrible Terrible. Makes you feel like there is no hope for mankind or at least this band, which is true."
5,Wonderful,"This album is absolutely incredible. It combines the best of ""OK Computer"" with the new elctronic sounds of ""Kid A"" and ""Amnesiac."" For those who were looking for a OK 2 you will be disapointed with HTTT but if thats the only expectations you have for this band then you should probably find somthing else to listen too. Radiohead brings us a beautiful album with beautiful lyrics and music to back it up. We could'nt have asked for anything more."
3,lost between radioheads weakest moments,"I wanted to like this album i really did, i loved amnesiac and kid a, and of course like everyone else the bends and ok computer. But this doesnt belong in any of those groups, it doesnt even feel like a new radiohead album. sure sail to the moon and 2+2=5 are great songs, but why not just make a single. The album is half filler and half songs that hardly make it but for a brief instant. But thats just my opinion , its still radiohead and i suggest everyone try it, no person feels the same."
1,A Meal Fit For A Thief...,"Naw, even a thief would trash this pathetic excuse for an album. As much as it pains me to do it, I must agree with all the negative reviews here. This is boring. This is mind-numbing. This is poor. This is tired. This is nothingness. Actually, even nothingness is more than this CD. I'm guessing the 5-star reviewers are misguided fools that think they're shining with some sort of perceived superiority. Don't make me laugh. They're obviously not as slick as they think they are. They don't know why they like this album. They just like it cuz it's Radiohead. This is a hammy disasterpiece. Radiohead have disappointed me 3 times in a row. How can one of my favorite bands of all time disappoint me 3 times in a row?Make way for disappointment #4."
3,Not especially good,"Hail to the Theif was the first Radiohead album I'd heard that I didn't immediately fall in love with. On both OK Computer and The Bends, and even Kid A and In Rainbows, right from the opening songs I loved the albums, with even the lesser songs getting at least 4 stars. Not so with Hail to the Theif. There are some good cuts, sure, but on the whole... not their best album. I'd only recommend this for the most devoted fans and/or completists, and definitely not until you own their other albums."
2,"Still not back to their best, but give it a chance","I was hoping this album would see a return to the form of OK Computer or The Bends (though to even come close to equalling those two superb albums would be amazing) so was quite disappointed when I first listened to this album.While it is not as experimental as ""Kid A"" or ""Amnesiac"", thank goodness, it still has quite a few tracks that could be straight out of those two albums, complete with random noises and unintelligible or pointless lyrics. However, there are a few tracks that are reminders of the good old days: ""There There"" (by far the best track on the album), ""Where I end and you begin"", ""2+2=5"" and ""A punchup at a wedding""The songs that fall somewhere between the good stuff and the experimental stuff tend to grow on you though, so if the stuff that is reminiscent of Kid A (buzzing noise and pointless lyrics) is ignored, this album is pretty good, rather than just average."
2,Very dull and lifeless.,"I was really looking forward to this album when I heard about say, 7 MONTHS BEFORE IT CAME OUT! (Seriously, critics, stop trying to overhype new albums. It's getting old.) I thought that it would be a return to OK Computer material while still focusing on the electronic-based music of Kid A and Amnesiac. Sadly, I was wrong.Don't get me wrong. There are 6 great songs here. The first 4 songs are classic Radiohead, ""The Gloaming"" is a weird ambient song, and ""Myxamatosis"" sounds Depeche Mode doing metal. But the bulk of the album is made up of bland repetitive songs that are just plain boring. ""We Suck Young BLood"" sounds like Halloween music, for Christ's sake! And ""Wolf At The Door"" has Thom Yorke almost rapping! It's pathetic.While I do dig the ideas that went through the album to please ALL fans, there are just too many flaws on this album. Just wait for the next album, which should come out in 2004 or 2005."
3,A once great band.......further falling into mediocracy.,"I am waiting for the great Radiohead experiment to end. Personally, I thought Kid A, with the exception of a couple songs, was terrible. Amnesiac was even worse. Hail to the thief, while somewhat better, is a long way from their earlier work. Thom, put down the bong, pick up the guitars, and play.Also, I want to concur with sentiments other reviewers have made: Just becuase it's radiohead, does not make it good. Sure, Rolling Stone and every other critic loves them, but as a fan, and a music lover, I am still waiting for them to return to the glory days."
3,Were it any other band...,"Hail to the Thief doesn't do it for me like OK Computer and Kid A, and there's one reason why: this time around, it's about the songs and not the record. Those albums are conceptual masterpieces, the apotheosis of what can be accomplished in the record form. Hail to the Thief, while full of great (well, mostly just pretty good) songs, feels like a collection of unrelated songs, a moody, atmospheric b-sides collection. Any other band would be hailed for such work, but we hold Radiohead to a higher standard - when a great band makes a just good album, it's a little bit awful."
5,And I don't even like them,"I've never really liked Radiohead, the singer's voice kind of annoys me, but this album blew me away. I still think they're pretentious but here they actually pull it off without it being embaressing, which is pretty rare in music. There are so many different forms of music going on in this album it can take a while to digest, my suggestion is finding a favorite and listening to the rest of the album every time you want to hear that. That's what got me to love it. Backdrifts is just cool."
5,wow,"wow this album is amazing thats all i gotta say, dont listen to the fu ck faces that say this cd sux....cuz it doesnt."
2,a catchy mistake,"Although this album sounds as good as anything else they've recorded, I think conceptually the boys have sort of lost their way. One doesn't release two ground-breaking works of near genius and THEN decide to tackle ""the big issues"" like politics. I mean, I tend to cringe whenever politics enter music at all. Again, sounds lovely, but the ham-fisted title and cover art put me off. Feels like a career miss-step. Anyway, I'm not going to buy it."
5,Pulled Off the Impossible!,"The boys did what I thought was unthinkable. They made a freaky ""out there"" record and pleased both the pre-OK Computer camp as well as the post-Kid A electronicas. What a way to stay in the mainstream, stay popular, sell records boys. You're big stars, you'll really go far, have a cigar. By the way, which one's Radio? This album is Kid A/Amnesiac kissing OK Computer/The Bends. Some ripping guitar but not too much. Some electronic freaky sound effects but not too much. The usual quasi-cool cryptic lyrics. Did anyone know The Gloaming was about [to quote Thom Yorke] ""...the rise of the right wing..."" Wow! Heavy lyrics dude! A definite must buy for all certified lemmings."
3,I'm just not sure,I agree with the reviewer that Radiohead takes a couple of listens to appreciate but i am not currently impressed with this album. I long for the anthemic granduer that was OK Computer and the Bends. I think i can grow to appreciate their later records but not love them. But you have to respect a band who is constantly pushing their limits and the limits of popular music.
5,phenomenal,"Radiohead have gone and done it again and produced a brilliant album. For those fans who are hardcore Bends fanatics and feel betrayed by the experimentation done on Kid A and Amnesiac, you will not be disappointed by this album. And for fans who prefer the light-on-the-guitars approach taken by the two most recent records, well, you will not be disappointed either. The band has made an album that blends their early work with the latter-day Radiohead and produced a heavenly median. Standout tracks are 2+2=5, We Suck Young Blood, There There, The Gloaming, and Punch up at a Wedding. Of course, being Radiohead, these songs are just the extra-exceptional of the 'merely' exceptional. I recently saw Radiohead perform at the Tweeter Center in Massachusetts and was able to experience many of the songs off of ""Hail."" All I have to say is whatever it is they are doing, they should keep at it, because it's working. Really, really well."
5,Exceptional,"Perfect blend of old school Radiohead and the newer sound. If you want another OKComputer, look elsewhere. If you want some innovative, catchy, dense, kick-ass grooves then you have some to the right place."
5,How do they do it?,"Just as edgy and interesting as their last 3 studio albums, Hail to the Thief actually seems less forced, both musically and vocally than much of Radiohead's recent work. This album is never boring or predictable, and presents a nice blend of raw energy and thoughtful composition not often found in today's music scene. Listeners who were thrown by Amnesiac (which requires a lot of patience the first few times through) will find Hail to the Thief much easier to swallow, while die-hard fans who appreciate the ever-changing face of Radiohead will most definitely not be disappointed."
4,Strange and wonderful.,"Radiohead as always been a group that you either get or you don't. And ""Hail To The Theif"" is no exception. The album, filled with political comments and such, manages to deliver a good listen, with some tracks takeing a rock approach, while others going into depressing electronic sound. A great album that should not be missed."
5,Truly Great,All the songs on this album are mindblowing. HTTT is a work of art that will be remembered as a classic album that will change rock as Radiohead continues to do.
4,radiohead reigns again,"with a modern-sounding mixture of ok computer and kid a giving a soundtrack to fear of the present world, radiohead have proven themselves yet again.i can only give it 4 stars though, cuz 4 of these songs don't seem to sit well with me (backdrifts, the gloaming, i will, punch up at a wedding). maybe they're great, but they don't stick in my head. the other songs are great though."
3,Radiohead on a Plain,"Relative to their past glories (OK Computer and Kid A)this album feels half awake. It has SOME of the intelligence of the past ones, but fewer good melodies, hooks and peaks.After I sucked the goodness out of the excelent: 2 + 2=5, scatterbrained, sit down/stand up, sail to the moon, it felt a bit empty.And frankly, there are really boring stretches of music here.Granted, relative to all other popular band music, it fares better. And it's not realistic to ask a band to change the world of pop music 3 times.But this album is mostly for Radiohead fans. For the fairweather Radiobrains fans, stick with the aformentioned albums."
2,Worst Spec. Ed. Package Ever,"Although the album is radiohead's weakest I think, the recording package is definitely the worst ever concieved. Buy the regular version because the ""special edition"" is a films paper thing that doesn't fit in any cd racks, doesn't protect the cd, and it costs more."
