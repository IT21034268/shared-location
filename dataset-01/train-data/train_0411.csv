5,Completed costume,"This completed my grandson's halloween costume. He loves it, takes it every where he goes, it is made very well & the price was perfect."
1,you make it they break it,it was fun for about two minutes and is easily breakable. my 3 year old likes to play super hero but this shield was very flimsy. tried to mend cracks with duct tape but did not help much. Walmart and Toys R Us carry a frisbee like shield a bit smaller but very durable and is the one all the children play with.
5,Great shield for a great price! Our son LOVES it!,Durable! It has been taken just about everywhere with our 5 now 6 year old son. WARNING- the red paint will stay on anything that he accidentally bumps it on... including our BMW! Great construction and a favorite in our house!
3,Nice prop for price!,QUICK shipping! Nice prop to go with halloween costume! It matched the toddler costume perfecty; although he got bored with it and didnt want to hold on to it long it was nice to add to the costume! Works for pretend play for younger kids
4,Good addition,"I purchased this shield to go with the Captain America costume for my son. I chose this one thinking that since the price was higher than other similar shields I have seen, that the plastic would be thick and thus the shield would be less flimsy, more durable. Not the case. It is thin. BUT!! It has held up to my very active and rough 5yr old throwing it around maniacally so it is definitely doing the job!"
5,Capt. America Shield,"My grandson (2) is Captain America, at least, when you ask him who he is. His cousin, grandson (5) has a shield and when they got together and grandson2 saw the shield his eyes got huge. When he found he couldn't take it home with him he was heart broken, so grandpa to the rescue. When the shield arrived in the mail he knew who sent it. You made me a big man in my grandson's eyes. He's hardly with out it. Thanks!!!"
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","Bought this for my son for Christmas. It's the one and only thing he has asked for over and over for Christmas this year, but we are going to return it immediately. It looks cheap and feels cheap - it's so flimsy it'll likely break the first time he drops it on the ground."
3,Captain America Shield,This is a nice shield. I thought the shield would be more durable but it isn't too bad. As long as a child does not plan on sitting on it the shield will do. If it was more durable it would be a better buy. Not too bad for its price.
3,"Okay for little kids' costumes, NOT adults","Just got this in. It's about 12-18"" in diameter--wouldn't have ordered if it had that size listed on page. Oh well. Maybe a 6-year old kid this would be a perfect costume addon or if they were a Captain America fan (how likely though,right?), but its small size makes it not as good for giving as a novelty item to an adult. Don't get me wrong--looks great, and all, but definitely smaller than expected."
1,Breaks easily...not a good toy,I bought this for my 4 year old - who LOVED it - but the thin brittle plastic it's made of cracked in less than two days of normal play. It should have been priced more like a $2 party favor than a $15 gift. Apparently not made with children playing in mind.
3,nephew loves this,My nephew was so happy to get this shield. He loves to dress like superheros & has had so much enjoyment out of it. Luckily he is a child that is very careful with his toys. This is not the most durable product. Its made out of a flimsy plastic & I thought it was a bit overpriced.
5,Almost Famous,"The Bloodstream EP is no doubt a perfect debut. Whilst it is only an EP (four tracks) I still find myself listening to it a year after I purchased it, it is a recording that has had a profound influence on me - which is a nice change compared to a lot of the other rubbish that has been released in the last year. Apparently their full length release is due by the end of 2006 (very keen to get my hands on that).You can draw some comparisons between Stateless and other bands / groups, but I really feel that such comparisons will not give you a clear idea of their musical expression.Do yourself a favour and get this EP, or at least wait for the LP to be released."
1,A Terrible Account of a GREAT Story,"Anyone who loves the underdog has to love Gary Williams. He has bounced back time and again over the course of his career and faced tremendous odds. Winning the National Championship was truly Sweet Redemption for him.However, this is quite possibly one of THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. As a voracious sports biography reader, this book falls short of the mark made by even the lesser sports books out there. Vise did a TERRIBLE job of accounting the situation. This book is DEVOID of any passion on his part. It reads as if a high school journalism student slapped it together using a simple writing formula : ""Here is what happened"", <Slap in a quote from Gary>, ""Review what I just told you again.""You could get the ENTIRE contents of this book by reading newspaper clippings from Gary's career. That's basically all this book is, one big newspaper clipping.Gary Williams deserves a much better book than this one."
4,For all basketball fans and Maryland fans.,"Sweet Redemption is the well-told story of how a very good and very dedicated coach and some very good and very dedicated players -- whom most other schools overlooked -- finally brought the NCAA Division I men's basketball championship to the University of Maryland. Like the movie Hoosiers, it should be of interest to all basketball fans -- indeed all sports fans. But it will be a special treasure to supporters of Maryland basketball who for years watched their generally quite good teams suffer one frustration after another. Maryland's 2002 basketball championship was indeed sweet redemption which all true sports fans should be able to savor."
5,for the true maryland fan,"for those who knew and went through the pain of Len Bias this book takes the reader from the cellar to the top of the mountain and the struggle that one man endured along the way to restore the image of not only a program but the sport as a whole. Gary Williams for all of the things that people said about him and recruiting, did it his way and as a result it was a way in which produced a championship for the University it it's dedicated fan base. Just an overall great read"
4,Creative Headphones,A nice balance between compactness and the usually inherent over-the-ear design bulkiness. Very good sound quality. Little or no clipping at the highest volume levels.
3,Great for price,"This is our third pair! The sound quality is great, and I like having the option of them working actively or passively (in the event the battery dies). The battery life is great on them too! The only thing I would improve is the quality of the materials it's made of... the earmuff parts dry rot pretty quickly over the course of 1 year if not used frequently, and there are no replacement parts. I recently upgraded to an Ableplanet brand from costco and the new ones are better craftsmanship."
5,great set of headphones for the money,I had been looking for a pair of noise canceling headphones from Creative. When I got my Zen X-Fi it came with great earbuds but I have small ear canals and could not wear them. This headset works great with my X-Fi and they come with the airplane adapter and a great little carrying case. Terrific price.
2,Poor Sound Quality,Noise cancelling was ok. The sound quality was poor as if I had the treble turned way up. No bass response to speak of. Considered a waste of my money. Would not even want/use them for free.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased these noise cancelling head phones so my kids could watch their portable DVD players on long trips and be able to hear them better. Unfortunately, the noise cancelling feature is almost not discernable. I would not recommend them."
5,great CD,I enjoy listening to this one in the car. Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass boys really shine through in these old live recordings. Great live CD!
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I have previously purchased a knee brace for my husband from this seller which worked out Fantastic and I was very pleased. I just recently decided to purchase 2 different ones for my 88 year old mother, which arrived 5 days ago,unfortunately due to arthritis in her hands she is unable to fasten them and now have to return them. Upon reading the return policy they post under returns, it states they are not returnable. I wonder why they don't post this on the page where you order from. Be assured I will very thoroughtly check out a vendors return policy in the future. I only opened one and have all the original packing so I will wait to see and if anything changes I will update this review,Maryann"
1,RIP OFF,"Not shipped as shown on photo. No brackets to keep it in place. They want to sell you a floor mat that will roll up under your feet, blocking the pedals and cause you to wreck and die. This company sucks really bad."
3,This CD is a joke.,"I have to say it is quite a shame the Pixies broke up. ""Death to the Pixies"" is much more grand than this atrocity. The songs which were on the ""Bossanova"" CD and the ""Doolittle"" CD are classic, but none we have not heard before. And ""Subbacultcha"" and the songs from ""Trompe Le Monde"" are terrible. This CD is a complete waste of money. If you are a huge fan like me, just borrow it from someone and record ""Wild Honey Pie"" and ""the Radiator song."" This is a mockery of all the Pixies work. It falls below the standard and should be priced around 5 dollars."
1,"Excuse me, but did you say ""EXTRA TRACKS""????","The title of this CD mentions ""EXTRA TRACKS"", but the song listings are the same as the other PIXIES LIVE CD. They both have 15 songs listed, and are in the same order. I don't see any extra tracks here. Where are the extra tracks thou speakest of?"
2,Lacks Pixie power,"This album lacks the potency and power of the earlier studio albums, although fair, a pixies virgin would be better off starting with Trompe Le Monde, (one of the best records ever made). Little more than background music."
3,Another example of art imitating life.,"I was required to read this book for my American Lit class in college, and though I had heard that James was a bit verbose and that the plot of the novel was purportedly about the life of a telegraph-girl, I nevertheless enjoyed it thoroughly. The novel centers on a young girl who works at the sounding board of an English store. Because she is the main operator, she is privy to all of the customer's private affairs, for she transcribes all of their personal notes. Some of her insights regarding relationships and the often-intimate details of her state of mind seemed to articulate some of my own thoughts. The ""hook"" of the plot(as concern other female-heroines of her time) revolves around her intense fatuation with a male customer, with whom she eventually falls in love. ""In the Cage"" is taut, well-written, and eerily similar to the trials and tribulations of everyday life in the present era."
5,Absolutely exquisite.,"I was influenced by the one review that was posted when I bought the CD last month, so I want to add my enthusiastic recommendation. The first band alone is worth the price of admission. Beautiful musical taste, perfectly executed. I can't wait to get the other 12 CDs issued by Smithsonian."
4,How It Feels When Parents Divorce,The item arrived on time and was well packaged. It was very helpful in seeing things from a different point of view.
1,Senatorial Privilege,"You can breeze through this book in under an hour -- I just did. While it makes for a suspenseful, albeit entertaining, account of what happened that infamous night, Damore relies too heavily on witnesses' accounts and police remarks (often little more than Kennedy bashing). By now, most of us can accept the facts: that EMK drank way too much and drove off a bridge, subsequently leading to tragedy. DUI accidents happen every day, chillingly often to average people. The fact that this happened to one of the greatest Senators in the history of the United States only reaffirms this. ..."
3,"Certainly not her best . . . try ""2 x 4 Furniture"" instead","I was disappointed with many of the designs in this book. I think the pasted on fabric was tacky and extra-homemade looking. The colors she chose for the painted pieces are hard to look beyond. There is a great buffet and an interesting kitchen cabinet piece in here, though. I would recommend her previous book entitled ""2 x 4 Furniture - Simple, Inexpensive & Great-Looking Projects You Can Make"" over this selection."
2,"Mostly craft projects, not furniture","Unfortunately, this is not a book of plans for building solid, simple 2x4 furniture. A more accurate title would be: ""21 Home Woodcraft Projects for Women"". The first half is an overview of woodworking tools, and the second half describes 21 projects. Only two of the projects use actual ""2x4"" lumber, many are not ""furniture"", and ""great-looking"" depends on your taste."
5,Burning For Buddy,"How do you begin to describe the GREAT BUDDY RICH? What drummer hasn't been affected by Mr. Rich's thunderous snare drum roll. Neil Peart's and Cathy Rich's efforts in getting the great drummer's on the DVD in nothing but awarding!!! It's nice seeing ""rock"" drummers come to express their awe for one of the Jazz Greats!Mr. Dave Weckl's Mercy, Mercy Mercy was funky. Mr. Omar Hakim was great as usual. And the others keep me up at night reviewing the DVD over and over. It's refreshing to see the combination of veteran drummers like Joe Morello and newer drummers like Marvin ""Smitty"" Smith and Manu Katche. A must have for all drummers."
2,Headache,It does work but unfortunately it gives me a big headache and I cannot take even a half dose. Keep in mind that this is a sedative and not a hypnotic.
1,Read manufacturers summary....,"Hylands: Sleep Aid Calms Forte, 1 CtBe the first to write a reviewItem DescriptionTemporarily relieves the symptoms Of simple nervous tension And occasional SLEEPLESSNESSNon-habit FORMINGNon-Drowsy FORMULA100% naturalIngredientsPassiflora Hpus, Avena Sativa Hpus, Humulus Lupulus Hpus, Chamomila, Calcarea Hosphorica, Ferrum Phosphoricum, Natrum Phosphoricum, Magnesia PhosphoricumDirectionsAdults And children 12 years or over: as a relaxant 1 To 2 capletswith water as needed three times daily for occasional sleeplessness: 1to 3 caplets 1/2 To 1 hour before retiring children 6 To 12 years1/2adult dose*******************************************************************Above is the manufacturers summary of the product. Note where it says non drowsy formula. Well, they are correct. It did not help me sleep at all, nor did it help me relax. I wouldn't waste my money if I were you."
1,Weirdest dreams!,"Life has my mind on overload right now , so after reading the reviews , I figured an all natural sleep aid might not be a bad idea.Well, let me tell you ....I woke up from the most vidid dream I think I've ever had ! My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to get back to sleep ! I've thrown the pills away. Tonight , it'll be warm milk."
1,Try them if you don't want to sleep,"I never suffer from Insomnia but I was very tired last night and I wanted to have a good night of sleep, My husband has bought them, took them once and did not do anything to him, so I had one pill last night, only one, and could NOT fall asleep the entire night finally I got up at 3:00 A.M. got a tylenol p.m. and 30 mins. later I was deeply asleep. I wanted something natural but this thing is useless. So instead of helping me I think these pills were the cause of my insomnia, would never try them again."
2,Doesn't work for me,"Unfortunately these pills did nothing to help me get to sleep, however I did notice I was calmer after taking them, and that is one of the effects of the pills."
3,not so great,"I was hoping this product would help me sleep. I didn't notice much difference between it and all the other herbal remedies out there. It may have calmed me a little, but that's about it. Would not recommend for insomnia."
1,Does absolutely nothing - They are placebos,"There is nothing in these pills, not any active ingredients, just a bunch of herbal things that won't hurt you if you OD on them. Don't believe me? There's a Youtube video of a woman swallowing an entire bottle of these pills at once and she never gets sleepy or sick. Anyone who thinks this pill is doing something is experiencing a placebo effect. And of course, I took 2 of these before bed and was up all night, they didn't work. I wish I knew they were placebos before I bought them."
3,Undecided,"The only thing really to say is that ""it is what it is."" I'm not real big on homeopathic or alternative medicine but for the price I decided to give it a chance. I wanted to use it as an alternative to Xanax every night for help sleeping but it didn't work well enough for that. To be fair, I only notice a minor physical difference with the xanax, except for it puts me to sleep right away instead of rolling around for 3 hours like the nights when I don't take it. It may work for you, it may not... but the price isn't bad and it didn't have any side effects so it might be worth a shot. Oh and they're about the size of a sudafed, easy to swallow."
4,Fast service,"I am U.S. military, stationed on Okinawa, Japan. I received this in less then two weeks, which is incredibly fast for overseas. I would have never went with this company if they did not have the Amazon backing them up. Amazon has been known to have companies that are relible subworking under their name. The product was packed secure. Calms forte works. I sleep amoung hundreds of people at close range. It helps you relax and rest with noises everywhere."
3,Maybe works a Little Too Well,"I debated between giving this product three or four stars, but I decided to go with three so it's right in the middle. They do work, but almost too well. It says to take one for relaxation and two or three to sleep, but I just took one and after about twenty minutes my eyes got really heavy and fell asleep almost instantly. I wanted them for the anxiety purpose too so I thought that wasn't too great, but at least I was going to be able to sleep for the night. I was dead asleep for about twelves hours! And so groggy the next day. So they worked, but maybe too strong for me. Maybe I should cut them in half? I do love herbal products and homeopathy, and I've been trying to find the best procuts for me, but I'm a bit on the fence with this one."
4,helps me sleep thru the night,"I decided to try this product after reading about it and its reviews. I found that it indeed helps me sleep through the night. Sometimes if I do wake up, I find that because I am more relaxed from the Calms Forte' I can fall back asleep, which is always hard to do. I have learned that the best combination for me is one tablet of the Forte' with 1 or 2 1 mg tablets of melatonin. No grogginess or any other side effects and I do get better sleep now that I have started using it nightly. I would recommend it to folks that wake up after a few hours of sleep and stay awake long afterwards. This will help."
1,Do not waste your money on this!!!!,"I read the reviews and thought this is just what I need. Sounded harmless but this is seriously placebo pills. They do not work! I don't have insomnia, per say but sometimes have trouble falling asleep. This literally makes me more awake. No joke!!! I took 6 pills because the recommended dose did nothing and even 6 pills did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! One Benadryl can knock me out, I am going to be sticking to that. This is my first review ever and I'm writing it from half way across the globe. I bought it also to help me during the 20 hr flight but it did nothing. So save your money and get your self something that actually works!!! I wish I did."
3,Calms Forte,"It's a natural product, but most sleep aids do not work well for me! I felt a little calmer, but did not sleep as quickly as I would have liked."
1,didn't work for me,the first time i take 3 before bedtime and didn't help me i don't even feel sleepy!maybe because i used to take panadol night
3,hog callin,"Well i havent used the feral hod calling tapes yet but have talked to people who say they are great. We are taking a trip to east Texas in march to hunt feral hogs, ive hunted these animals many times in Texas, south in the brush country, in the panhandle, central , and east Texas piney woods, georgia, ala, and fla. weve used varmit tapes with a little success but i am looking forward to the hog tapes. When we return with success, ill write a followup review that should contain glowing colors."
2,WCW Fall Brawl 1998 review,"The tag team match between The Dancing Fools(Disco Inferno & Alex Wright) against the team of Jim Neidhart & The British Bulldog was a rather pedestrian tag match with the requisite goofs and timing issues. The Chris Jericho-Fake Goldberg match was a super dud. The Norman Smiley-The Cat match was agony for both the ears and eyes. The Rick Steiner-Scott Steiner match was a pretty good brawl until Buff Bagwell(who was in Scott Steiner's corner) got his neck broken. Don't worry he's okay now. The Cruiserweight title match between Silver King & Juventud Guerrera was not very good but at least they were trying. The Raven's Rules match between Raven & Perry Saturn was not great but still a pretty good hardcore brawl. The Curt Henning-Dean Malenko match was a one-sided nightmare. The Konnan-Scott Hall match was pitiful. The Wargames match between Team Hollywood, Team Wolfpack and Team WCW was pretty good wrestling wise but awful entertainment wise. I give this PPV a 4 out of 10."
5,"Great Quality, Good Fit & Great Price",I ordered this shirt to be an undershirt in the winter months so that the mock turtleneck would show through. The first thing I noticed was that the quality and thickness of the fabric is exactly what I expected from a Tommy Hilfiger product - 2nd to none. The price was great for a name brand like Tommy Hilfiger and the fit was great. I ordered a large and there was plenty of room and did not fit smaller than a true large like some other shirts I have bought in the past. This was exactly what I expected.
3,Be careful of what you're getting!,"The storyline in the ad is that of the 1954 full length feature film while the DVD is that of 20 half hour episodes of the TV show. I wanted the movie and ended up with the TV shows. While I enjoyed watching them, it wasn't what I expected. I didn't send them back because it wasn't worth the shipping costs. I should have read more carefully!"
4,Classic TV comes to the Theaters (1954 style!),"DRAGNET was a monster hit on Radio and television when, in 1954, it finally made its way to the big screen.Directed by creator/writer/star Jack Webb, the film, like the TV and Radio shows before it, show the real-life work of a big-city Police Force.This film, in a move very unusual for 1954, opens with a shotgun blast trained right at the viewer--an image that was decried at the time but seems tame today.The stylized acting and dialogue play as old-fashioned, but the mystery at the heart of the film works and the characters are well drawn.A nice film of its type--and one that led to another film and, eventually, still another TV series."
1,These reviews are not for the DVD shown,these reviews are not for the listed dvd. On the box of the picture shown it says 10 esps not the 20 or more everyone is listing . Please make sure you know what you are buying before you are disappointed... thanks
5,I liked this movie MUCH Better than the recent movie with Dan Akroyd!!!,"My mother and I really think the original movie based on the television series with Jack Webb as Joe Friday is a whole lot better!!! Jack Webb makes the crime story allot more real by telling the crime story as is as read from official police files!! With Webb as Friday and Ben Alexander as Friday's partner Frank Smith from the original radio and black and white television series of the 1950s, this color movie is the best Dragnet movie I have ever seen!!! I heard on a rerun of the radio series that this motion picture was advertized!! ""It is in wide screen and color"" said the announcer. The movie was in 1954!! Thank you very much!!"
4,Heart warming,"I found this book to be very good. I enjoyed the first time, I read it and I am enjoying it again. If you love poetry and different quotes then you will love this book. I too, wish that it was hardcover because the binding becomes worn after several readings of it."
2,High school,"Cute store, but you don't feel very involved with the characters. The message is good for young readers. I like that she felt thin for herself."
3,Surprising couple,"This book has a fun premise questioning what would happen if the tough girl falls for a nerd. During one of her scuffles Marisa and the person she is fighting with has a tutor with him. His tutor and Marisa accidentally get their phones mixed up. This sparks their romance. In addition, Marisa is ready for a change and transfers to his school, so they get to know each other even more.This was a fun book to see how the two would get to know each other's perspectives and both inspire each other to step out of their comfort zones. An example of their funny relationship is that Marisa tells him that he wears the pantalones, but she gets to pick them out. This tells a lot about their ""accidental love"".Adapted from my blog post: http://mrsvsreviews.blogspot.com/2009/02/accidental-love.html"
2,Lid does not fit properly,"The lid does not fit very securely and I thought it was defected and ordered a replacement, which doesn't fit as well. It slips around and won't give the seal that I was hoping for when cooking certain recipes."
4,"Full of suspense, mystery, and intriguing characters.","Owen and Spot make a great P.I. team. All the characters were interesting and unique, adding much interest to the story. I especially enjoyed Mr. Borg's descriptions of the Lake Tahoe basin. I felt myself visiting the mountains along side the characters."
5,"Page-turning, gut-wrenching mountain mystery","This is a great book. It is fun. it is informative. It gives you a great feel for the California/Nevada mountain areas and the treachery of unbridled wealth. The author has a good sense of humor and the presence of Spot adds to the personality of the book. I heartily recommend this author and hope you start with Tahoe Deathfall and continue through all of this writings. Thank you, Todd Borg, for the great read!"
5,Outstanding Thriller,"Had I known I would have loved this series so much, I would have probably finished all the books by now. This is the first book in the Owen McKenna detective series and it grabs you and just doesn't let you go. The characters are wonderful and the addition of Spot the dog is brilliant. He adds a dimension to the storyline that is pretty funny. But it's a good story, keeps you guessing, and has enough twists and turns to keep you from not wanting to do anything else but finish the book."
5,Great Read!!,"This book was my first book by Todd Borg, I enjoyed the Owen McKenna character and Todd Borg's style of writing. The book is a fast read and hard to put down. Looking forward to my next Owen McKenna novel."
4,enjoyable first book in the series,I like mystery series with repeating characters. this is the first book of several and plan to continue reading the series
4,Fun read while in Tahoe,While on vacation in South Lake Tahoe I came across the Tahoe series at the Red Hut restaurant. It was a very entertaining and fun read. It kept me turning the pages. Reading about many of the places I had just visited made my trip even more enjoyable. I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
4,Tahoe Deathfall,A very enjoyable read. Details of Tahoe are very accurate. I love the way he brought in the character of Street. Very different and interesting.
4,No Complaints Here.......,"This book was fantastic. It was a post-Civil War novel about a wagon train of individuals on their way to Texas. When I finished the novel I had an urge to start reading it all over again.The romance aspect of the book took a while to heat up, but the anticipation was exciting, frustrating, and sweet. I wouldn't change a thing about the book, including the controversial rape scene. People need to remember this it is just a story! It's not like women haven't fallen in love with someone who has taken advantage of them before. Give me a break. Besides, the character in question was also a known thief and murderer; I don't hear any complaints about that!You couldn't help but root for Lydia and Ross, even though Ross wasn't always likeable. Ross's character was flawed, but always desirable and I looked forward to his appearances.It's one of the better Sandra Brown novels for sure."
5,Loved it!,I bought this book in the airport on my way to Las Vegas and I could not put it down. I didn't leave my hotel room until I finished it! I love a good historical romance and these days its so hard to find a good one. If you haven't read this one yet then you are in for a treat! Happy reading.
5,This was an excellent book,"I read this bood about two months ago. It was one of Sandra Brown's many books that i have read, as she is one of my favorite authors. I could not put this book down. This has to be my favorite book, and I am an avid reader. Nearing the end of the book, i begin to get disappointed, as i didn't want it to end; that is how much i enjoyed it. I was delighted to discover that there was a sequel, Another Dawn. I would definitely reccomend these two books to anyone wanting an exciting romance"
2,Complicated reading,"The book is well written, it's an engaging story but the writer made the ""hero"" too nasty, the rape, ""yes it is a rape"" made him just as cruel as Russel, the real vilan in the story, and the reader is not expecting that from a ""hero"". That part in the book was a desapointment."
2,SUNSET EMBRACE,This book is great in that it describes heaving bosoms in so many different ways. It wasn't what I expected from such a writer. And what was this? He prized her knees apart? I think he pried. The descriptions of Ross and Lydia were so repetitious.And phony. The history wasn't right either. Divorces were not the common thing they are today.
3,Book Lover,This book was a little beat up. I was a little disappointed. Overall the book inside and out was okay.
5,sunset embrace,The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. Sandra Brown is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books
4,Most probably her best book!,"After having read almost all of Sandra Brown's full length novels, I have come to the conclusion that this is probably her best book. The hero, Ross Coleman is surely the best male character that she has ever created.The love story between Ross and Lydia is suely one of the most sensual and romantic one I have read in a long time.I have read the sequel to this novel, Another Dawn, which centres on Ross and Lydia's daughter Banner and Bubba Langston, one of the characters from Sunset Embrace. That too is a great novel, but nowhere as sensual and emotional as this one.That's why I was shocked about what happens to Ross at the end of Another Dawn!!...read Sunset Embrace if you are looking for a true hero you are not likely to forget anytime soon!"
5,MEMORABLE READ!,"After reading all of Brown's wonderful contemporaries, it doesn't surprise me to find that Brown pulled off an historical with the same memorable flair. SUNSET EMBRACE kept the pages turning as fast as I could turn them. The love story between Ross and Lydia leaves you thinking about them for days. I loved this story and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great love story."
1,Plodding. Wished it would be over. This was a mystery with a little romance.,"It was drawn out and uninteresting. The characters were ok, but the whole package of plot, action and characters was boring. Nothing surprised or delighted me. Story brief: father's wife died and he lives with his daughter Meg. He owns a chocolate factory and someone stole gift boxes and money from the factory. An Irishman Gareth works in the factory. Meg and Gareth seek to solve the mystery, since the guilty person is trying to frame Gareth. Meg has no plans to marry and wants to run the factory after her father dies.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: four. Setting: 1892 London. Copyright: 2006. Genre: historical mystery with some romance."
2,Not for me,could not get interested in the story. The premise was good and I liked the idea of the murder club but somehow it just wasn't for me.
1,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"This scale was DOA (dead on arrival). Upon reviewing the manufacturer's website, I saw this was quite common. Do yourself a favor and look for another scale."
4,Good but there are better!,"There is too much crappy rock and rap music. The dance music saves it though, with great songs from Styles & Breeze, Chemicals, Uniting Nations, Sunset Strippers and Geri."
3,Shell' WW of Golf,"The quality of the video and sound is OK. The transfer from tape seems to be the problem But if you want to see a near perfect golf round by Hogan, get this special DVD."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this item along with the 10pk single storage cases. Shame on me for thinking Memorex would be good quality. Cheap cheap cheap! Really thin plastice sleeve, really thin plastic altogether. The smell when I opened the package from Amazon was horrible! Smelled like burned oil. Just awful! Not to mention I'm not even sure if I have the new or old packaging because the packaging I recieved doesn't look anything like the packaging on Amazon's website. I will probably be throwing these away as soon as I find better ones. I've already opened the packages to see if it was Amazon's box that smelled or the actual cases so I'm sure I can't return them now so... $30+ wasted. Please don't waste your money on these."
5,This batch is OK,"I purchased 2 of these 10 packs of twin DVD cases on 07/27/2012. Judging by the other reviews, I lucked out and got one of the ""good"" batches. The cases are well constructed, the snaps for holding the discs secure and easy to use, and the plastic sleeves are thick and tightly bound to the cases.I didn't have as much luck with the single DVD cases (see my review atMemorex Standard DVD Cases 10 Pack.Based on the reviews for both products and my mixed experience with Memorex cases, I'll probably be shopping for other brands the next time I need to buy cases. That's too bad, because these twin cases are OK; unfortunately ""lucking out"" is not a good way to consider the same brand twice."
5,dvd storage,"These are sturdy, well made dvd cases. They hold two dvds. This is the third time that I have ordered this product and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I will probably buy from this seller again!"
5,excellent storage for DVDs,This product arrived on time and in perfect condition. We have a large library of MINI-DV videos and are in the process of transferring all to DVD. The 2-disc DVD case is the absolute best way to catalog and store the DVDs.
5,"Awesome job, Thank you.",Thank you of rthe prompt service. Packaging was professional and product was sent in a very timly manner. Thanks again.
3,Not What I Expected,"OK 2-disc cases, but not what I expected. A holder on each side, rather than a center holder for disc 2, thus no clips for literature, etc., such as scenes card. Description should point this problem out, maybe have an additional picture showing this problem (a problem at least for those people expecting the clips)."
4,Plastic is little thin otherwise good,"I just got back from a trip overseas and with the strict luggage restrictions and fees the airlines pose these days I had removed all the movies and music I purchased from the original cases to save on luggage room and weight. These seem to be constructed decently enough but they are just a little more flimsy than I had hoped, by that I mean the plastic is thin, I can easily see these cases getting accidentally crushed under foot as were most of the originals were thick and hard like rental store cases... that said they are still a good value for the price and really helpful for keeping pairs of discs together."
4,They're Ok,"I don't burn many disks anymore, but I like these 2-disk cases. The quality seems ok for me, no problems like others have stated. They're just plastic cases, so it was all good for me. Price is ok, but should cost less for a vanishing format. Clear window insert looked good too. Not hazy like some I've tried. overall, these are decent enough for me, though I doubt I'll have the need to buy again."
4,Just what I was looking for,The TWO DISC DVD cases are very hard to find in my area .... It was exactly what I needed ... and am happy I could find it at Amazon.com
5,excellent product,this product is very well made.it is very good quality. if you need a cd/dvd case get this product.i highly recommend this product.
2,Not What I Expected From Bon Appetit,"I anxiously await Bon Appetit's cookbooks. They are typically very good for someone like myself who enjoys cooking as a hobby but also loves tasting food. The recipes in this particular book were SOOO basic/boring, I was disappointed! The majority of the recipes were something I could have come up with after not having gone grocery shopping for three weeks! If you're looking for BASIC-BASIC, I guess this is okay--kinda like ""How to Make a Sandwich-101. But not for someone who thoroughly enjoys the art of cooking and entertaining. Sorry, Bon Appetit--I'll still buy your yearly cookbooks, though--they are wonderful!"
1,Big Disappointment,This cookbook was not what I expected at all. Most of the recipes are not that interesting/appealing and not what you would expect from Bon Appetit. I may use two recipes out of the entire book. Suggest you not waste your $$.
2,Not Up To My Expectations,"This one disapointed me, although the other Bon Appetit cookbooks that I own have yielded spectacular results. Check the individual recipes yourself on Epicurious on-line reviews. There are some real dogs in this volume--Prosciutto, Mozzarella & Basil Pizza--one should not cook basil; it looses its taste(p 93). Scallop Stir Fry (p 31) was average, although Noodle Pancake that goes with it was excellent. Also average--Broccoli & Cauliflower Cheese Soup w/ Sausage soup (p 63). Hubby had to wash the sauce of the Ravioli with Sage Cream Sauce (p 41)--sauce for two servings contained 3/4 cup white wine!I resold my copy of the book. Not worth keeping"
5,Book Review,I love this book. The recipies are very helpful. Easy to make and they make very nice meals. I would order this book again.
3,An informative political allegory,"X Men, the youthful animation that divides love and evil, is a good film, incorporating great special effects, not to mention the childish violence. But X Men really is a grave political allegiry, highlighting how the governments of the world sometimes thing they are making changes for the best, whilst the silent minority, in this case the mutants, think otherwise. Taking it on one level, this film is an entertaining, action-packed thriller, but one should really consider how the undertone of this animation reflects on a democracy whereby everyone should be considered, and not just the elite. Three stars; that really is all I'm giving."
5,Best movie ever!,"I didnt see this movie in theaters but when it came out on dvd, I bought it as soon as it came out and loved it. I still love it. I thought that it was better then spiderman, daredevil, and any other movie I have seen latly. I cant wait for x2. This time I wont miss out on seeing it in theaters."
4,What ever,"I have read most of the reviews for this movies and I must say I am not all that impressed with them. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie and I am a huge X-Men fan, but we have to realize that Rouge did not get that white streak in her hair from Magneto's machine she got that when she took Ms Marvels powers and that is also when she got the ability to fly. Not to mentioned that they kill Sabretooth he is like one of the best villians that they have as for Toad I don't remember him ever being in the comic books. I was heartbroken when they did no include Gambit, Beast and Juggernaut on the movie. I think that if they make a second part they need to include more of the original comic book characters. As for the cast I think everyone did a great job if they would have picked a different crew I might not have liked the movie as much. The movie all in all was great."
3,Disappointing Adaptation,"I disagree with those who say this movie remained faithful to the comics themselves... Particularly with the way the movie seemed to adjust the timeline--placing characters in the film when they shouldn't be, leaving out people that should be there based on the people they DID include, or making them appear at an age inappropriate to match the characters around them. There were just a lot of things that didn't add up. It WAS an ok movie, and it even had a bunch of fantastic scenes that really brought out the personality of the characters (like Wolverine's cage fight scene early in the movie)--but then there were other times when I thought the writing/acting didn't do the character justice at all... Rogue, for example, didn't quite come off as her usual self, nor did Magneto have enough of his cool, calculating charisma. Oh well. It's a watcher, but not neccessarily a frequent re-watcher."
3,"Stylish, but too short and lacking in emotion...","This movie, quite frankly, was a disappointment. It had great actors (Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart), a halfway decent plot and good special effects. So what's my problem? I didn't actually CARE about any of the characters...It fails on the gut level. Part of the problem is that the movie is very short, so there is no room for real character development.I'm comparing this movie to the Michael Keaton Batman flicks. Now THAT's how you turn a comic book into a movie! This is closer to Batman Returns (which I give 2 stars) than to Batman (5 stars).Rent, don't buy. (I unfortunately bought the DVD without having seen the flick. Wanna buy mine?)"
4,A great movie and a wonderful start for more...,"How do you pack 30-some years of X-history into a 2-hour movie? How do you please the people and make the movie still loyal to the comic? This film played out like an honest movie than a superhero-action flick. I was very impressed with the acting despite the numerous characters fighting for air time. It was a good start to introduce the millions of people not familiar with the X-family and the next movies should have even more of their universe. The problems I had with the movie are my own. I would have liked to have seen more mutant cameos (Havok, Cable, etc...) and Gambit as a character. The 2nd should be more action packed and hopefully, we'll get more development."
4,Caution as a gift for a comic book fan,"This is a great movie...however if you are looking to buy this for a comic fanitic be carefull. First off, all die hard comic fans have already seen this movie. The main problem lies in the characters. If you are expecting the marvel x-men with this is not the film for you. The die hard fans that I watched this movie with found many areas where the characters did not jive with the established lititure, but, none of them had any complaints about the rest of the movie. The only reason this did not get five-stars from me is because of the inaccuracy of the characters. On the other hand I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie. The DVD version is worth the extra couple of bucks simply because of the extra clips. DEFFINATLY ON PAR WITH MI2 AND GONE IN 60 SEC."
4,immediately decided to add to my collection,"As soon as our group got out of the theatre we all unanimously rated the movie as a four out of a possible five. As a science fiction/action adventure film I would give this a five. But as an X-Men fan, I felt a little disappointed that I did not see more characters. Also, the knowledge that I was going to have to wait a few more years before I would get the chance to see more of those characters rained on my parade a little.At the same time, I also immediately decided to add this movie to my collection after seeing it because it IS a good movie. For those who were introduced to the X-Men for the first time, this movie may have seemed sufficiently entertaining and complete in itself. But as for me, although I loved watching it, I just couldn't help myself from longing to see a more complete (and varied) team of X-Men and a greater sense of finality to the ending. Don't get me wrong - I loved the movie. But something inside me wanted just a little bit more."
3,"Fun, mindless, good effects.","Another mindless superhero type of movie, but enjoyed the costumes, effects and loose storyline. Just easy for a weekend night with the family."
5,The DVD extras were not that special,"I absolutely love this movie, but I really didn't like the extras that were included with the DVD. The extra 10 minutes of footage were mostly scenes that deserved to be cut (because they were stupid) or were just different versions of the same scenes in the movie. Hugh Jackman's screen test was not terribly exciting (after watching that I wondered how they knew he'd make a wonderful Wolverine), and I didn't even bother watching any of the other things included (interviews I think). But even though the extras are not that special, I still recommend buying the movie on DVD- the effects are of course amazing and the movie is a great sci-fi/action movie!"
3,More like 3 and 1/2 stars,The film raises some interesting questions such as what is the evolutionary path that we are on as human beings. Just as there's a reason there are different races born out of one blood we may one day experience mutations to our DNA that we can yet even begin to fathom.O.K. Forget about all that a let's just talk about the film which to me started out like gang busters and then lost some of it's intensity as the film progressed. The premise of the story laid a great foundation but I felt there could have been both greater character development or additional plot twists that would have made the movie more interesting. In short it seemed a little bit too predictable.The film is very enjoyable anyway. The effects are great and the acting is noteworthy. Particularly Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart.So check it out just don't expect too much from the story. I hope that if they do a sequel that it'll be better than the original.
5,THX Rules,"Just a quick thing to say, picture and sound quality on the feature during this film are absolutely stunning. THX certification really is the way to go. As with T2, the pic and sound here just rock completely. And the film is great as well. I personally really like it and find it very re-watchable as well. Extras also make this a great DVD for the price."
3,What's still missing in this movie !?,"The movie was good ! I actually didn't pay to watch it cause I fininshed watching one movie and went to another which happened to be X-Men. I say they needed characters like Gambit, where's Gambit !?, Beast, Juggernaut, etc. Why would they add a guy like Toad in the mix !? I hear a squeal soon !"
5,Exactly what I expected,"My best friend and I recently went to see X Men: First Class, after which she expressed an interest in seeing the others. I bought this edition to replace my VHS copy because it was inexpensive and looked reliable. The movie has some basic special features and plays well.As for the film itself: if you're a purist regarding the comics, you might not like it, but I have always found the earlier X Men films to be well acted and well written. Sirs Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart do quite well as Magneto and Charles Xavier, and Hugh Jackman makes a solid and admittedly attractive Wolverine. So, as before, there are deviations from the comics, but the film in itself is entertaining and intelligent. The X-Men is one of my favorite superhero films."
3,Triple-dip. Greed knows no limits.,"The X-Men movies are fantastic. The first being wonderful character-developing platform which re-launched the comics-to-film genre after Warner Bros killed it with the horrendous ""Batman and Robin"". The second being the typical rollercoaster action event with little plot, but multi-layered fight scenes and huge explosions.Fox's greed at cashing in on X-Men is rediculous. X3 comes out this summer, and fan furor will peak again, but why would fans want a bare-bones disc? especially considering most people have the two disc sets already (the original X-Men release and the 1.5 release) a third release is downright insulting."
4,X-men Dvd,"Good Product. Even better movie! Bryan Singer totally did this comic book justice in bringing it to the big screen. The second movie was even better than the first, but still doesn't take away from the first one as a single film. X-men was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a kid and the movie just made the story even better. The casting was great. The character building was perfect. The special affects were just right: enough to be sweet to the eye, but not overshadow the story or characters. Too bad Bryan Singer didn't stay on for the third movie. Oh well. He did great with Superman Returns."
1,Not much to say,"I would love to review the particular Item, but I never received it from the person I ordered it from, so alas, I can't give you a review. needless to say I will most likely not order from the person I ordered from when I ordered this VHS..."
2,Just terrible...so terrible,"First, what was the point in the introduction in the movie where it's WWII Poland? Who cares about that?Second, according to the comic books : Wolverine is alot shorter, meaner, and a better fighter. Rogue is older and taller-- not to mention more sexier-- plus she can FLY and lift up to 50 tons! Cyclops is older and muscular. Phoenix (Jean Grey) is extremely powerful! Storm has or had a mohawk.Third, where's Nightcrawler? Colussus and Beast? Why was Storm played by Halle Berry-- she's too light skinned and not tall enough. They could've casted Iman or Naomi Campbell.Fourth, why wasn't this movie played at it's original run time which has 80 minutes of footage cut out from it? The hell with the morons who have to sit through it and try to UNDERSTAND the movie. Let them see Batman 4."
1,Wish You Well,"Wish You Well by David Baldacci is one book I just couldn't put down. A great story about one family's life on top of a mountain in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia in the early 1940's. Its about honesty, integrity, hope and true love. In particular, it is about a young girl and her brother who grow up and learn what life is really all about...about having decent values and not compromising the truth. Great character development. Interesting facts about rural life in the mountains. Superb story. I only wish I could have been there myself."
1,Why oh why???,Totally overblown hype caused me to spend my money on this plotless waste of a movie. I'll learn one day. A comic book plot does not a good movie make.
1,HONESTLY I DOZED OFF AFTER 30 MINUTES OF THIS RUBBISH,BEFORE I SAW THIS FILM I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN AND ACTION PACKED. IT WAS BORING. IT WAS A 100 MINUTE FILM AND 90 MINUTES WAS TALKING. THE ONLY HALF DECENT THING WAS THE FIGHT ON THE STATUE OF LIBRETY BUT EVEN THAT WAS SHORT AND UNREALISTIC. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM RENT IT TO SEE FIRST. WHAT A BORE
1,X-Men,We did not receive this item. We would rather not rate this item since it was never received... We consider it a zero star not even 1 star.
3,"Is Hugh Jackman hot, or what !?!?!..","..this is a great movie for the older kids, and X-men fans; but I'm sorry, Hugh Jackman is just the hottest thing on two legs,and steals this movie away from everyone else."
3,"Not bad, pretty good.","Whether you're a fan of the comic books or not, this fun, action-filled adventure is an interesting venture into the world of comic-to-film, from the mind of ""The Usual Suspects"" director Bryan Singer.With a fairly impressive cast, including veterans of both stage and screen Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellan (Magneto) this film delivers a real-life yet futuristic look at the popular comic adventures. With several serious undertones of race, equality, and politics, there's a classic veneer of witty one-liners and excellent special effects, coupled with a sensitive story-line and well-presented action sequences.The DVD offers some good extras, but the one that most fans wanted was not to be found: an audio commentary. With a couple of Easter Eggs included, fantastic sound and good picture quality, it makes this DVD not bad, but not one of the best."
2,The comics are better,"A totally mindless film adaptation of Stan Lee's X-Men Comic book series. This film had me pndering for hours why a director would destroy a perfectly good comic series into an hour and a half of endless idiocy. The acting was fairly good to start, and the beggining looked almost promising, but then, it dropped off considerably once you hit the first action scene. This movie may be based on a comic book series, true, but to make a feature length film out of people flying in the air and smashing each other is pointless. The director did do a good job with the casting I must say though, Ian Mcklellan, and Patrick Stewart save this film from hitting rock bottom."
3,"Fun action flick, good Saturday night movie`","Anyone looking for a good, fun movie with no baggage and no heavy emotional involvement would be well served by X-MEN. This is not Orson Welles, it's not even Orson Scott Card, but it is fun nevertheless. Patrick Stewart is a dead-on Xavier, and Hugh Jackman is almost as perfectly cast as Wolverine. The costumes have been updated (and watch for jokes referencing the costumes from the comic series), and a few major characters from the cartoon show do not appear, such as the Beast and Jubilee, but overall this is a fun movie experience that will not disappoint but will not change your life, either."
1,Terrible! This is NOT X-Men!,"This movie destroyed the X-Men and weakened all the characters that they were not at all interesting or special in any way! And I can't believe people liked this junk! They are definitly no fans of the X-Men comics or the 90s cartoon, if they where they would agree with me and not like this film. There is no point in watching this movie just stick with the comics and 90s cartoon, they actually have entertainment in them unlike this film!"
2,I guess you have to be a comic book fan,"This movie was just OK. The special effects were excellent but that's all. The acting with the exception of Patrick Stewart was average. The plot was true to the comic book genre, in that it was simple and predictable. I hate to think that the future of movies lies simply in special effects created for the DVD audience and that the moviemakers forget that movies need believable plots and good acting to truly make a great movie."
2,It's all or nothing in my book...,"Hollywood made a good attempt. As both an X-men fan and an actor, I can understand complaints from both sides.The critic in me sees how characters were introduced in the wrong order (Beast and Angel came way before Wolverine or Storm). Some were even missing, such as Gambit. And then Toad and Sabretooth were killed, leaving Magneto with just Mystique.The actor in me understands how expensive it can get to travel all over, hosting auditions and gathering so many people together for a film, including big names that bring star-power to it: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Barry, etc.In the end, I feel the story of the X-men has been around far too long to be done in an incomplete manner."
1,DISSAPOINTMENT,"I went into this movie with an open mind, and left feeling like I wasted my $8. This movie lack the great story and special effects of movies like: Batman and Robin, Supergirl, Battlefield Earth, Happiness and Enemy Mine. Patrick Steward as Prof. X? AWFULL. They should have casted Wayne Newton (he has more acting chops). As for the rest of the cast, I thought their acting left alot to be desired. Personally, besides Newton as Prof. X, I would have had as Wolferine, Steven Segal; Storm, Sally Field; Cyclops, Robert Downey Jr.; Jean Grey, Rupaul; and Magnito, Nipsey Russel.Note to Brian Singer. Re-watch these classics, and if it's not too late, make the sequel much better."
2,This movie lacked too much,"To be brash and shortwinded in a review i shall say it screamed to have a sequel made of it no-one dies nothing major happens, the arch enemy is in an escapable situation and generally it could just be a long episode of the animated series. Now to take a look at how some trilogy films had great endings lets think of a few ... hmm the matrix with its other scripts already around i hear they shall be excellent and that had a brilliant ending did it not it allowed for sequel yet had a very major event in it. alien had a resonalbe ending although the next 2 films were feeble in comparision but that is not fault of the original. this film did have an excuse it could not change too much as then it would be too unlike the series and comic but where are the expendible charachters who they chose to edit, the film however has good special effects and would probably please a fan of it but possibly not the more discerning viewer"
2,Not as nice as it seems,"The graphics are somewhat cool, but the movie itself lacked a major factor ""an ENDING"" . The only part I like was a special feature of Spider Man entering into a scene which made everyone laughed. My last word is that the movie needed more than just special effects."
2,Sound STINKS,"My husband had seen this movie in the theaters but I missed it. I was eagerly looking forward to watching it on our 5.1 surround system/widescreen digital TV...however, the sound shifts between (and even in the middle of) scenes were so dramatic that I spent the whole movie changing the volume. Our volume was as high as 20 at some points (usually during dialogue), and as low as 8 (during the storm and fight scenes, for example). The sound quality was OK (it is, after all, THX), but the constant volume adjustments left me really irritated and I will not watch this DVD again."
2,If you have a brain you'll go do somethin constructive.,"What a disapointment. I'm a fan of Singer and the X-Men books that I've been reading since I was ten and this movie is worse than ""Batman & Robin"". Absoulutely pitiful script introduces characters through coincidentile run-ins and tries to fill in plot for non-fans within five minutes of dialouge between Wolverine and Xavier. Dammnit Singer what happened to you, ""The Usual Suspects"" rocked than you do a horrilbe adaption of Apt Pupil and this. Betrayed, utterly betrayed. If it wasn't for awesome special effects I'd give this one."
2,X-Communicated,"Sorry, but I just thought the movie was a complete BORE! The effects are the only thing going for this kiddie-flick. Better luck next time, guys."
2,What is this?,"The X-men movie had me going once it was announced to hit theaters. So I saw it on HBO shortly after its theater run was done. And I must say that this film is bad! While the acting is not what it should be and the tone just wasn't there, the film seemed to lag at every turn. Hugh Jackman was a good choice for Wolverine, but just about everyone else didn't fit their roles.The SFX were good and some of the fight scenes, while entertaining, were ridiculous. The film also seems to try and mimic the mood of Batman during the final battle of the film.X-men, though, did try to portray the comics the way they were supposed to be, but comes up tremendously short!!"
3,Good movie,"While three stars may not seem that big, I must admit that this is the best comic book to movie screen adaption ever. Even better than superman"
5,The Best Movie in The World,"I loved this movie. I wish I could watch X-Men everyday. This movie was great because it had wolverine in it. I loved wolverine in this movie because he has razor sharp claws and he could heal himself. I really loved the special effects. This movie was even better than ""Men in Black."""
3,Good movie but falls short of the comic book quality..,"Ive been a huge X-Men fan for quite a while. I imediatley though that it would be worth going to see, and invited my friend who is also a great fan of X-Men, more than me. But as I watched I realized something, not enough fight scenes. Fighting scenes have been an integral part of the series and I looked for a little more action in the movie. The final sequence was top knotch and gave me hope for the sequel. I also thought they left out some characters that could have bettered the movie. Gambit should definitly have been in it and Rouge didnt even act like Rouge considering she didnt fly or have super strength. She also looked like she was 15. The story is layed out well but I think the director came short in creating a true X-Men epic. Great special effects and good acting save this movie, I just think it needed a little more..."
3,Not as good as the comics.,"I expected more out of the namesake. The movie was decent, but does not live up to the reputation.The movie was still fun and the special effects were respectable."
4,Loved the Movie...Hate the Widescreen,"As the title says, I really loved the movie...as a long time fan of X-Men comics I feel they actually stayed pretty much true to the comic which is rare in theatre now-a-days. My only dislike was the DVD version was in 2.35.1 ratio which took my 36"" TV and made it 12!! Other than that, excellant movie and I can't wait for a sequel!"
4,X-treme Entertainment,"This movie kept my eyes glued to the screen when I first saw it at the theater (openning night). All the characters were well done and brought to life by a well picked cast. All the actors fit their roles so well, you could almost believe they were accually the characters. Hugh Jackman did an excellent job as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart (like always) produces an excellent performance as Professor Xavier. I know there are some net pickers out there that are saying that the film wasn't true to the characters in the comics. Well, tough. There are going to be some compromises when you try to bring a comic book with character such as the X-Men to life on the big screen. Regardless of anything that was left out from the comics, I think this movie does fine with what it has. This movie is perfect for a starting point to what will hopefully be an X-Men saga if not a trilogy. Become one of the X-Men and get this must have movie."
4,"Yeah, but did you see...","As an X-Men fan, I liked the fact that they finally hit the big-screen (Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart ROCK!). As a movie fan, I applaud Bryan Singer for concentrating on the criss-crossing relationships between the characters (though I wish Storm had gotten more screen time). And as a DVD fan, I hope a ""specialer"" edition comes out with director commentary, but it's fine. The ""Making Of"" and screen test are nice touches.But, what about the ""easter eggs""? I won't give away what you'll see, but look closely on the trailers and still gallery menus. The ice rose and Wolvie's dog tags... Hmmm..."
4,X-cellent,"I enjoyed this movie more than I ever thought I would in the theater and have enjoyed showing the DVD to people who had real doubts about its ability to entertain them at all. This is a fun movie, but more than that, it fits in enough drama and characterization to rise about standard action fare. It didn't try to be brilliant, but it tried to be thoughtful and good and it succeeded. Few will proclaim it a masterpiece, including me, but I will call it entertaining fun with a soul. I have shown it to many non-comic people and have always been pleased by their surprisingly favorable feedback.For what it is worth, I hope the good folks at Fox are making another solid script and director Brian Singer priorities for the sequal. I hope they don't, but fear they will count on just the X-Men name to carry subsequent films because that is not what made this show financially successful or good."
4,Enjoyable film,"X2 is better, but the first one provides a nice bit of context and adds to the overall experience. Enjoy."
4,A Bit of Fun,"X-Men is not a film that is going to last forever in the annals of film history, but it is a fun movie, enjoyable, fast moving, pretty good plot and excellent action sequences. The story is not particularly cerebral, but it doesn't have to be - good, solid entertainment with mutants beating each other over the head.Enjoyable stuff."
4,Oh...they should've given this the 2-Disc treatment,"This was the best summer movie of last year. This was also a great movie reditioning of the classic comic-book. Next, with all the cuts made before it was released, it should've made it easily onto a second disc. I mean, ye gods man, this was a great movie! How could they NOT give it 2 discs?"
4,Great Movie,"This is a great movie! I have loved the X-Men since I was little, and this is a great movie. My only hope is that they follow through and come out with a Weapon X sequel!"
4,x-men from amazon,i was very pleased at how quickly i received my purchase. watched it already movie in great shape for a great price
4,Good movie,"While this movie does not follow the canon of the comic books entirely, it is still a good movie, and a fair adaptation of the comic books, with nice special effects and a good cast. I enjoyed this movie even though I could spot what was different from the comic book."
2,no no no,Ok I'm a big huge x-men fan... but please gimme a break.Storm... I know there was a Storm in this movie... but where was the Storm I know of? It certainly wasn't the simpering scared girl depicted here.And the mix was terrible... Old x-men with New x-men with young x-men all at the same time...I still watch the movie a lot the special effects were great!
2,Good Effects Bad Movie.,"Two things to point out: 1. The speacial effects were great. Must Have on DVD for your home theater. 2. The worst movie ever, from cheezy lines to a plot with more holes than swiss cheeze! Its a horrible thing to do to the once great and prosperous X-Men Cartoon show on TV. I rather be wacthing X-men Re-runs than this movie!"
2,Um...This does not look good !,"Read the comic book series and pass this tepid release from 20th Century Fox. This, along with ""Spiderman"" (2002), are fine examples of why big-budget Hollywood should step aside and let the comics speak for themselves."
2,waste of time,"This movie is very simplistic and predictable, yet too violet for a young child to view. Some of the special effects are interesting, but not enough to make you forget how boring this movie is. I watched this movie with my husband and 2 sons, age 12 and 15. None of us liked it. I admit it is not my type of movie, but it could have been and SHOULD HAVE BEEN my sons type. They enjoyed the X-Men cartoon when they were younger."
1,$-Men,"Plotless flick made only to promote thousands of various merchandise items, especially the non-action figures. Probably the first movie that genuinely *is* merchandise itself... Will obviously be loved by two-digit-IQ people, who consider comic books high art and must syllabize their captions aloud in order to comprehend them. No wonder it gets so many positive reviews (though I doubt if most of their authors actually know the definition of the word)."
5,X-men,"if you like the x men comics and love the cartoon, you will love the movie, great story, great cast, and gread effects, This movie will keep you glued to your seat, This is a great movie"
3,Comic book comes to life,"This is a must if you are a X-Men fan. I thought everyone in the film did a good job of transposing the comic book to film which will always be a difficult thing to do. I think many people have way to high of expectations when someone tries to take a comic book and make it into a movie. I mean it is a comic book for pete sake, not Gone with the Wind, it will be a little cheesey here and there. I thought the characters, sets and costumes were done very well and many aspects of the movie made me interested enough to watch it again. I look forward to another X-Men film continuing where they left off in this movie. X-Men is definately not a ""must have"" DVD but it is fun to watch and as a fan I really enjoyed seeing the story brought to life."
5,X-Men! X-Men! You impressed yet another customer!,"Well, this is an awesome movie. Many of my favorite characters are in it, like Wolverine and Magneto, my two favorite characters in the X-Men universe, and it is greatly well done and made quite good too. Oh, and you should have seen the fight scenes and humorous moments. They were out of this world all the way to Uranus! Okay, nuff said! Buy this movie and enjoy, fellow X-Men lovers!"
3,Flaws in X-men make it a movie to rent.,"I cant believe all the excitment everyone made over this movie. I thought that there were some parts in the movie that really kept to the comic books. However I was really disappointed when I saw this at the movies. I was expecting the original X-men and then some. I was expecting Gambit to be in this and I thought Rouge was too young. In the comic books it shows her being older. The movie was ok but it was made up of anticipation of the movie coming out. If you want good movies that have been taken from comic books buy Blade, The punisher, The phantom, etc. Just rent this movie first and then if you like it then buy it."
3,A Beginners Guide to X-Men,"Overall, this was a good movie, considering what they tried to do. Compiling years of comic books into one movie and having it make sense is something that even the worlds greatest writers and directors can't accomplish without a few flaws. Die-hard comic book fans will immediatly recognize every error (and there are many), which spoils the movie for this (very large) percentage of the movie watchers. For the rest of you, the movie is a great show of special effects, and does a resonable job of showing what the X-men are, given the time restraints."
3,Not The X-Men I Know,I've been a X-Men comic book reader for a long time and all i have to say is who are these imposters playing in the X-Men movie they look and act nothing like the comic book heroes i know.What's up with those stupide costumes the're wearing?The only one that looks true to the original character is Prof X.The special effects are pretty good i'll give them that and i guess Magneto is kinda cool too it's an ok movie if you just wanna watch a movie but i find that hardcore comic book fans will agree that it could have been way better.
2,Pretty bad -- really.,"Even for a movie based on a comic book, this one is pretty unwatchable, partly because it tries to take itself way too seriously. I saw ""X-Men"" shortly after seeing ""Fantastic Four,"" and it suffers greatly by comparison. The only non-cardboard characters are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), and even then Wolverine was too much the nice guy instead of an antihero. This also may be Patrick Stewart's worst movie yet, and Ian McKellen doesn't come out much better. The other actors simply chew the scenery. And -- again, even for a comic book -- the plot holes are enormous. E.g., where did the billions of dollars come from to construct the underground complex at Xavier's private school? (I hate to think what the tuition bills are like. . . .) The original Superman and Batman flicks are proof that a good film of this type is possible."
3,Cheesy? Yes. Still- it's a COMIC BOOK forcryingoutloud,"Cheesy-factor is through the roof. Hollywood loves thissort of thing. There have been a bunch of other goodcomic book films and comic-bookish films over the lastfive years. This one falls in the middle of the pack: betterthan the worst of the Batmans, and worse than Spiderman."
3,X Men review part 2 part 1 on on X Men DVD reviews 7.5/10,Back to my review. I got the chance to see this movie again been 9 years. I liked the cast decent story good action scenes I will review all the X Men movies I hope you enjoyed this review & I hope you read part 1 first.
3,NOT BAD!,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT BAD. IT SEEMS THAT ONLY WOLVERINE AND THE TONGUE GUY (SORRY, NOT AN AVID VIEWER) WERE THE ONLY TRUE WARRIORS. EVERYONE ELSE WAS SO VULNERABLE AND ONE DIMENSIONAL. NONETHELESS, EVEN WITH THAT, IT WAS A GOOD FILM. VERY WELL MADE IN RELATION TO THE TV SHOW. GOOD CAST, HALLE BERRY WAS VERY A VERY APPEALING STORM. I'D COMPARE THIS TO MORTAL KOMBAT. HOPEFULLY THE SEQUEL WILL BE BETTER THOUGH."
4,Good for first time x-men viewers,"First of all I have to say that I am a die hard X-Men fan...Ever since I was a teen. I have X-Men #1 comic. So to say that the movie was some what of a dissapointment is an understatment. But, if a person knew nothing about the topic, it was a brief intro to the theory and storyline. Oh yeah, and the casting could have been much better....especially for Wolverine....but after all it was a movie, and if it raises interest in X-Men then it did its job."
3,X-Men,"I thought X-Men was okay, I mean the special effects were neat and all. Though this movie, is not the best and some of the characters are cool. A movie about some bad guy named Magneto who wants fo conguer the worldn and a professor who wnats to stop him is basically the plot. I thought Wolverine was cool, but this moving got a little boring. Some characters like Toad were plain dumb,they didn't even make sense. I mean a guy with a huge tongue that can do ""amazing things"" is really messed. The truth is X-Men I think is a movie that boys and only boys will like. It's has some action and will hopefully bore you."
2,Extra DVD features are pale in comparison to the Matrix,"Although the movie was good, it's clearly evident that this was a hastily put together DVD. The DVD features are pathetic and pale in comparison to what was done on the Matrix. It's a pity they didn't spend more time adding interactive content to take advantage of the DVD format, instead they relied on clips from the Charlie Rose show and artistic drawings. I also disliked the way they selected to show the extra 10 minutes of footage they spliced out. The DVD would display the original uncut scene and then it would display the cut scene directly afterwards. Wait for the enhanced version (if one ever does come out)."
2,A liitle too much but not enough...,"While adult fans who rememebr the comic book will like the updated trip down memory lane, Most adults will find it a little inane. My 10 year old thought is was soso and I would not let my 8 year old watch it. Some cool effects but really disapointing overall. I think it played a little better on the big screen but not much."
4,ALMOST 5 stars,"This movie would have gotten 5 stars except for one thing....not enough action. Like most new-era comicbook movies, the characters actually looked like themselves. Their super powers were acurate. Also, major comic book plot points were kept in, to provide some sense of continuity. If only all these elements were combined with mondblowing action. Sure the final battle scene was cool and long, but what else was there?Aside from this, the movie was very good. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) is destined to become a big star. Also, Patrick Stewart in a role he was born to play (wink,wink) Director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) helmed what could easily be called the definitive superhero movie of the new century!"
3,Pleasantly surprised,"Although I'm not familiar with the X-Men comic books, I found the film to be rather entertaining. The acting was much better than I expected, and the storyline was well defined and moved quickly. The special effects and action sequences were particularly well done, with a few ""standard"" action movie one-liners, but with minimal cheese. I found Halle Berry to be totally miscast as Storm, and her acting was the weakest, although she had a very small role and not much character to develop. The ending easily allows for sequels, so I expect there will be more."
3,"This was alright, I guess.","I wasn't an x-men fan or follower when I watched this, so I found characters a bit hard to take at first.The plot is pretty average. Nothing wowzers. It's not very immersive or provocative, but also not bad enough to put you to sleep, like The English Patient.The other main aspect of this film was the special effects. Again, they weren't state of the art, eye popping ones, like The Matrix.To sum it up: X-men is your typical action film.If your're an x-men fan, then you'll probably like this.But otherwise if your're like me, you'll find this just mediocre entertainment."
5,Great Movie for Great Superheros!,"This movie just isn't about good vs. evil. It is also about people or ""mutants."" The plot works on many levels. Also very suprising to me it was actually pretty funny. However you have to be an X-men fan to get some of the jokes.{I.E - Yellow Spandex)"
3,Not a bad adaptation...,"I was a big fan of the animated series, but never read the comics. All of the characters translated well to the screen, thanks to an excellent job of casting. The only character that fell flat (IMO) was ""Rogue"", I couldn't even figure out who she was until about 30 minutes into the movie. The only major complaint I had was that they should have worn thier usual costumes, the black leather left this movie with too much of a ""Batman"" vibe. I would give this movie 3-1/2 stars, but the system limits me to 3. A decent and entertaining little action movie."
4,One of the best comic movies,"The fact that Wolverine spoke what every non-comic book fan was thinking makes the movies heads above all other comic movies. For example, when Professor X was introducing the team, Wolverine made fun of them. This is what the person that thinks all these silly comic names are ridiculous. Wolverine turned the movie into a worhthwhile experience. Thank goodness ... Hugh Jackman was able to take the role."
5,X-Men Personified,"I want to say that I don't think they could have picked anyone better to be Wolverine in the X-Men movie. If you look at Hugh decked out as Wolverine, he actually is Wolverine personified, as was Chris Reeves when he portrayed Superman in the Superman movies. I think that with Hugh bringing Wolverine to life in the X-Men movie, it's going to have a great impact on the way he (Wolverine) is portrayed in the comic books, because now we have all got a grasp on the actual physically human side of wolverine that a drawing cannot give. The portraial of all of the X-men was everything that I hoped it would be. I was a bit skeptical about there being mad a live-action X-Men movie, because of the amount of difficulty that their powers and basically the marvel universe would be to make into a live-action movie, but it met my approval very much."
4,"Good flick, great fun","Full of great special effects, and just plain fun, this is a great movie to have for a night at home with friends. See how many of the X-Men you can spot, and count the number of X's as they go by. See if you can catch a glimpse of Stan Lee, the original creator of the X-Men."
3,"Saw it once, that was enough","I've collected XMen comic books for years, even liked the cartoon but when I went to see this movie I was disappointed. ONe, Angela Bassett would've made a better Storm. Two, Storm could've had more than 3 lines. The plot of Magneto wanting to take over the world is fine but U wasn't that impressed with the movie. Why? In a way I think that animation or heavy special effects beyond a reasonable budget would make these films better. The Matrix kind of has taken a monopoly on ways to demonstrate superhuman abilities and lo and behold this summer they'll be in direct competition. Though the lines will be long an dthe theater inevitably crowded, I'll sensibly wait a few days, maybe go midday on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Pay Matinee for both of them. Lets hope Xmen 2 is better and not just geared towards 12 year old boys..."
2,Was hoping for something better,"I was hoping for something better, after reading and hearing about the movie as much as I did I came away somewhat disappointed. I guess when we get X-Men 2 thru 10 we can look back and smile. A great beginning if the series will continue."
5,X-Men is a worthy attempt,"The movie was a worthy attempt of conveying the true feel underlying the X-Men series of comics. However, as with most movie adaptations, it fails to do so completely. It is an inherent limitation of the medium. As far as the story goes, it is well thought out and portrays the story arc well enough, but the absence of notable characters from the movie doesn't help matters a lot. The contradictions detract from the movie for someone familiar with the comics, but if I were new to the storyline, it would be an enjoyable exercise in fantasy. All in all the movie is well done technically. The DVD is really good and the hidden easter eggs are a nice treat. The picture and sound are first rate and make the DVD an overall good deal."
2,15 years too late!,"It's really too bad the timing of this movie didn't coincide with the mid-80's when the X-Men were red hot.Hugh Jackman was a little better than I expected, but I expected so much more.The DVD's screen test with Jackman in it left you with little doubt that he is a true actor.But the acting he performed in his screen test was better than anything he did in the movie.It's ok at best...even if you are a die-hard X-Men fan."
2,"A great film in a great box, but....","I'd lve to give the film 5 stars, it was a great movie. But the DVD is only getting 2 stars. Why? The package looks great. There a bucketful of extra features. The sound is great.But the picture quality is lousy. Somewhere along the line, DVD makers have to be told that the actual film is what people pay money to see.Take my advice and wait 'til the X-Men turn up in your local multiplex to see them in action again."
1,Not good,"i am a huge fan of X-Men and i know alot this movie had faws all over it. They do not even have the original five. Ice man does nothing, where is angel, where is beast, and tell me how Wolverine and Sabretooth not remember each other after all they were on the same special force squad and went through weapon X. This movie is a disgrace to the comics. Where is wolverine slicing and dicing his opponets. i mean come on mystique giving wolverine a hard time fighting lets get real he is a master of practically every fighting style in the world. In the comics mystique would have been dead in 10 seconds. Her body would be in hundreds of pieces. This is a total remake of the original characters. I just don't understand why Marvel would let this movie be made without exact specifications of the characters and the comics."
4,X-cellent,X-men was a good movie. Perfect summer action flick for teenagers to see with their friends. Can't wait for the next movies.
5,Take a Chance and Watch It!,"I teach second grade. Needless to say, I have come to know the X-men as humans who have very special qualities which are used to fight crime. When this movie was in the theatre, I absolutely refused to see it when my friend asked me to go. I'm not a science fiction fan and don't read comic books. I also don't watch cartoons. Why in the world did you rent it, you may be asking. There was nothing else to rent so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did.I can't really explain the movie because it was unique. I base my feelings about movies on suspense. Did it keep me interested? Did I fall asleep? Did I find myself reading a book instead of watching it? I found myself answering ""yes"" to the first question. If you aren't one to enjoy sci-fi, rent it and see if you too might like it."
3,Good movie,"I was never much of a fan of the X-Men comic book (I'm waiting for the live-action Spider-Man movie next year), but I have the admit the creators of this film did a pretty good job. The story is intelligent and fairly interesting. The special effects are impressive without being overbearing, as they were in ""The Phantom Menace"". I did find the Rogue character a bit dull. Wolverine is the standout of the picture, with his wisecracking attitude and ferocious fighting style. The DVD edition has plenty of special features that should keep you busy for a while."
4,For those of you who don't read X-Men,"The reason I went to see this movie is that I'm a huge fan of both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKlellan. I know very little about the X-Men except what I've heard and so I walked into this movie with very little expectation. I was mildly surprised with the storyline, in the fact that there was one. I was very pleased with the acting and the characters themselves. The script was weak, with Storm's best line coming in as ""Do you know what happens to frogs when they get struck by lightning? The same thing as everything else."" OOoo..striking. The villains were interesting and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in total blue is enough to set any young boy aflame. Not the greatest movie, but better than most of the other comic book movies out there."
5,Fantastic Movie,"Brian Singer did a fantastic job with bringing the X-Men to the silver screen. He definitely followed in the footsteps of tim Burton, Batman & Batman Returns. Whenever comic books are made into movies, they always fail when they try to be a comic book, i.e. - Batman & Robin. Singer kept the characters real and human. As silly as Wolverine's haircut is, I owuld never have it, one can't help but believe it and accept it as real. This movie has excellent, but far inbetween,action sequences. Less is definitely more here. The character development of Magnetto, Wolverine, and Rogue was fantastic. The special effects were fabulous. Anyone who likes an action movie with a story and real plot, i reccomend buying purchasing it."
3,"Entertaining enough, though a little dull at times","Entertaining enough, if sometimes a little dull. Acting is generally good. It lacks real pazazz somehow. It's really a prep for sequels more than anything. I particularly enjoyed Jackman as Wolverine & Anna Paquin as Rogue. Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly did a nice job as well. I found the first part of the movie more interesting than the last half where all the fireworks take place. It won't knock your socks off or give you fond memories, but it will provide a nice piece of entertainment for an evening."
3,"Great movie, still region locked.","I loved the movie, although, this is region locked to the US. Blu-Ray players or PS3 systems bought outside the USA will not play this movie. I made that mistake. Oh well! Free gift to someone."
4,enjoyed watching it,I don't remember if I saw this before but I wanted to see it and so I purchased/rented it on my amazon kindle fire. I have enjoyed watching movies on my kindle fire and I think for this movie I had maybe one or two breaks but the rest was continuous.
3,meh,"meh. Don't know much about X-men, and this didn't really enlighten or addict me. Decent action movie I guess. Good acting."
4,Best Movie adaption of Comic,Thank God they didn't screw this one much too. ONly problem I jave i if you are a big comic fan like I am the movie really doesn't do the comics justice. I was really impressed with the cast they brought the X-Men to life. I can't wait to see the sequel and I hope they come out with one.
3,Coming Soon: X-Men 2 . . .and X-Men 3. . .and X-Men 4. . .,"This a pretty good adaption of the wildly popularly Marvel Comics characters. My main criticism of this movie is that it is extremely weak on story, and in fact the only thing it does seem to be trying to do with the story it tells is set up the respective characters with storylines for the inevitable sequels that will no doubt be in theaters in starting in a couple of years."
5,X-Men,"X-Men is an amazing movie. I was reluctant to see it a first.I knew a lot about the history because I had watched the cartoon when I was younger and ""played"" it with the local kids. The first thing that came to mind was a Batman and Robin type movie. Fakey and typical. It's nothing like that! I can promise you one thing, if I love this movie anyone will. It's really not what you may think but so much more. You can't get more gurly than me, 16 year old, mall going, fashion crazy girl,and yet I still love it. It's great for all ages and you will want to see it again. Best of all it has the hot guy action going on too. With Cyclops for the 21 and under age group and the more provacative Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) for the older crowd. Although I go for Hugh! I guess there are exception for ever rule. This film is fun, great for all ages and the gurly's will dig it too!"
2,I LOVE THE MOVIE,I was so excited that it finally came in the mail but it was broken. it didnt even play the full movie. I love the movie in the theaters so wanted to get on dvd.
2,X-Men 1,I liked the second more but the first one sets up the background for the battle between good and evil. The battle is in each of us as well as us against them. I like the concept alot.
3,Good start,"In X-men the movie we find a majority of the major x-men characters are there trying to save the world. However, the storyline has been done before. Therefore, it gets tiresome after about 30-40 minutes of watching the film. However, we do get to be introduced to most of the characters and see what their lives have turned out to be or what they are battling through in their personal lives. Other than that it is an average save the world type movie."
3,i have mixed feelings about this film.,"to the reviewer who said this movie was preachy because of the first scene in poland needs to get a grip.same goes to the reviewer who posted at yahoo.com who said nobody cares about the holocauhst.must of been some young white kid in denial.anyways this movie suffers from bad casting.mainly storm,cyclops,and rogue.the actors chosen for them was all wrong.halle berry is my girl but she just doesn't fit the role of storm.maybe,iman,or vanessa williams.and the make up for mystic was a tad bit too much.and wheres the dialogue?.the action was a bit too restrain.and plus not enough x-men.but the movie did do good by making the comic book semi real life issues real.done verry maturly.hopefully the sequel will deal with the sentinels and friends of humanity.now that story will be good real life drama and sci-fi comic book action."
2,Not as good as the cartoon,"I grew up watching the X-Men cartoons, so I was disappointed to realize that they were going to try and make it real (so to speak). I really didn't enjoy this movie very much; they left off most of the better mutants (think Gambit and Beast) and the ones that were present weren't the same as in the cartoon. Trust me, pass this one up (unless you aren't familiar with the cartoon--my husband never saw it, and he enjoyed this movie)."
4,This movie should have been longer,"I was totally psyched to see X-men. Patrick Stewart was *born*, born I tell you, to play the role of Professor X. Ian McKellan made a fantastic Magneto and if you could have cast anyone other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine I would like to know who that person is. That being said there were some disappointments about X-men, the largest being that the movie wasn't that long. I felt that the movie could have used another 30 or 40 minutes to further develop the characters. Supposedly there are a lot of scenes that were deleted from the movie, so perhaps ""X-Men, the obsessive comics geek version"" will be released some day with those scenes reintegrated into the movie."
3,"""We are the future Charles, not them."" Ain't that the truth!","I wrote this line because the X-Men are the future of good comic book adaptations. Yes Spider-Man is coming, but i'm not seeing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, and Kristen Dunst is just not red haired. The X-Men is not a Batman (for me the best adaptation yet), but is really entertaining: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen ARE perfect on their roles, the other actors are good but they don't have comparsion with them. Good FXs , good plot but with some minor holes (is not a big deal), and it's simply good to see the X-Men on action in the big screen. 6 out of 10, 3 stars out of five."
2,X-crement,"What a let down. Why did it get rave reviews? Just as it got interesting it ended. Being a fan of the comic book I was happy with the disposal of the Blue & Yellow outfits in favor of leather, and Jackman was spot on as Wolverine. But overall it was flat and disappointing"
1,Should be renamed F90 unexplained.,"I bought this book because it was much cheaper than the other titles. Unfortunatly I got what I paid for. It just briefly mentions new features, and if you don't already understand them, you are lost."
5,Happy Gilmore,"This movie is a must have in any comdey lover's collection. One of the best movie's I have ever seen.""God I hate that Bob Barker"""
5,Just Tap Tap it in-Give it a little tap aroo,This was a classic movie for Adam Sandler and it might be the greatest golf movie ever plus its Adam Sandler as Happy Gilmorethe guy who was a Hockey player who can hit a golf ball 400 yards and like me he goes nuts for any damn reason in hell who knows why plus he wins the big tournament-Great MovieStory 9 Acting 10 Directing 10 Action 10 Entertainment 10Overall=49/50 wich is a 98% This is Great.This movie is recommended to any one.
3,About What You Could Expect (or Maybe a Little Better),"I bought this on a whim after seeing Adam Sandler in ""Anger Management."" I was also aware of his ""goof-ball"" reputation from his SNL years. ""Happy Gilmore"" is about what I expected: zany, goofy, and thouroughly enjoyable in the right mood. It's not the kind of movie I'll watch over and over again (or even over again), but it was definitely worth the bucks spent. You learn absolutely nothing about golf here, but if you like Sandler, or goofy comedy in general, I bet you will like this."
4,"Funny Movie, Horrible DVD","Adam Sandler's ""Happy Gilmore"" is a very funny movie that I watch on a regular basis. It's very amusing and I consider it to be one of Adam Sandler's best movies. However, the DVD of ""Happy Gilmore"" is the worst DVD I own in terms of bonus material and extras. The DVD only comes with four bonuses, one of witch being the theatrical trailer. The other three are production notes, bios, and film highlights. None of these three bonuses are actually watch able. They're just written out and have to be read like an ordinary text. There is no commentary on the movie, or anything like that. Reading the bonuses is relatively irritating. However, since I bought the DVD for the movie, not the extras, I still give it 4/5 stars."
4,Fun-Funny-Classic,"Well, you get just the right amount of sarcasm, wit, raunchiness and craziness in this classic flick about wanna be hockey star turned pro golfer Happy Gilmore.Watched it again last night and will probably watch it a couple of times a year!"
2,Silly Movie!!,If you only ran out of good movie watch it. I do not recommend it and never watch it gain. So silly!!
5,This is arguably the funniest movie ever made!,"Even the most jaded, cynical Sandler hater will be hard pressed not to laugh at this movie. It's the only entertaing film ever made about golf, and hearing Sandler say ""Friends listen to 'Endless Love' in the dark..."" is enough to make me laugh. Watch it and prove me right."
5,The Greatest Movie Ever!,i saw this movie and its my favorite adam sandler did excellent iwill see the movie anytime possible adam and golf really mix
5,One of my top 10 Favorites!,"This is by far the best Adam Sandler movie, if you don't have this in your collection you are missing out."
4,The Caddy Shack for Generation X,"I knew this movie meant far more than I realized when I unconsciously began doing ""The Bull Dance"" after sinking a fifteen-footer on the course. Great, great movie. I normally find Adam Sandler's work taxing on the nerves, but Happy Gilmore is the only comedy I have bothered to place in my little DVD collection."
4,One of the best comedies of all time,"Adam Sandler is hilarious. You can't deny that. This is his best movie (along with Big Daddy). This movie is filled with hilarious one-liners that make you laugh out loud. If you're in a bad mood, pop in Happy Gilmore and it is sure to cheer you up!"
3,The best of the bunch,Don't be fooled by Adam Sandlers past films like Billy Madison which was the most irritating film I have ever seen. Happy Gilmore is a good movie and Sandler uses his less anoying voice unlike in the WaterBoy and Billy Madison.
3,Comedy at its best--The Adam Sandler Way,"Another classic comedy from the master himself. Watch as this failed hockey player turns his dynamite slapshot into a four-hundered-yard golf drive. Sandler's character has to deal with a number of problems including his volatile temper, an overinflated golf pro, the IRS, and his love for a beautiful member of the PGA's staff. It's laugh-out-load, rolling-on-the-floor comedy for any fan of the many SNL cast members. (If you like this one try seeing Billy Madison of The Water Boy)"
4,Boy Sandler is funny,"Most of us remember Sandler from his Saturday Night Live days....so when he jumped to movies there was great expectation that he would be terrific. Well, thats just what happened. Happy Gilmore is an aspiring hockey player who happens to stumble into Golf. Sandler with his outrageous style keeps you in stitches all throughout the movie....I damn near fell out of my chair laughing.So if youre a fan of great comedy...check it out...its a gas!!!"
5,So funny!,Adam Sandler is so funny and he is really great in this movie!!! A million stars for him!! =) *~Becky~*
2,Not as happy as I would like,"This sports comedy is entirely too typical in most respects, with an embarrassingly bad subplot involving a former golf great and an alligator. But many of the gags are pretty funny, and there is some real humor in a blue collar hockey player forced to deal with the elite golfing world. The comeuppance for the cartoonish bad guy is cringe-inducing, looking like it came right out of the early eighties. But there are enough funnies to keep my interest."
1,Just plain dumb,"I think I laughed once during the whole movie. It really surprises me how many people thought this movie was hilarious. I've only recently watched a couple Adam Sandler movies because I told a friend I didn't like Adam Sandler(I couldn't stand his routine on Saturday Night Live), so he challenged me to watch some.He raved, and others of my friends raved, about Happy Gilmore. Well I watched it and I just thought it was so dumb. That idiotic voice he uses sometimes and beating everyone up...it was just so stupid to me. I would've stopped after the first 10 minutes, but I thought I owed it to my friend to finish the whole thing. Yuck! This was the typical Adam Sandler that I expected and do not like. Click was pretty good. I was surprised to like that one. But Happy Gilmore gets a big thumbs down from me. I guess I'm the odd ball since everyone else seems to love it. Ha."
1,Dissatisfied,"I bought the Happy Gilmore DVD for my kids at Christmas. We just opened it, it has no cover it is just the black case and it doesn't work. It freezes, and then skips half the movie. So annoyed, I paid for something and got something that doesn't work"
3,Ok To Watch Once,"I am a big fan of Adam Sandler movies and I had not seen this movie until now. This movie is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. Gilmore has not wanted anything his whole life but to be a hockey player. Gilmore can't skate in the ice rink very well which is what always stops him from becoming a professional hockey player. A golf talent notices how far Gilmore can hit a golf ball and gets Gilmore involved in golf. There are some funny scenes in this movie. Some of the humor though is dirty or just not funny.Basically in this movie, Adam Sandler acts like he does in all of following movies like Big Daddy and Mr. Deeds - a guy who is tough, but nice on the inside and always falls in love with a woman. However, as the years go on, Adam Sandler has polished himself and his character has geniunly become more likable with each movie."
2,"If this is Sandler's best, his worst must be wretched...","This movie was kind of funny the first time I saw it. It was ridiculously boring the second time. Adam Sandler couldn't be funny in this film if his life depended on it. Yet he has a knack for attracting the best comedy costars ever. Take for instance Christopher McDonnel in this movie. He's hilarious as the villain. And Bob Barker's role is funny, if not small. But Sandler is bothersome at the center of this movie. The plot is chock full of cliches and the humor is obnoxious and pestering. Sandler has had better movies, but he has not done better. If you're looking for humor from Adam Sandler, you're better off watching an Oliver Stone film."
4,Humour Knows No Boundaries 2,With this movie I learned how to appreciate quilt and how to fight with alligator!
4,"Happy ""SUBWAY"" Gilmore (Subway sandwiches)","Have you(SUBWAY)ever seen a movie(SUBWAY)that beats you over the head(SUBWAY)with it's product placement(SUBWAY) more than this one?(SUBWAY) The director/producer made no attempts to even be subtle(SUBWAY) about it. It was blatantly obvious, forced and jarring(SUBWAY) to the story flow.(SUBWAY) Even worse than the Coneheads(SUBWAY) movie. (SUBWAY)"
4,A missing scene???????,"When I first saw Happy Gilmore I loved it. It was on cable T.V. I am a huge Adam fan, so I had to buy it. So first I bought the VHS version. Then again bought it on a DVD. But I had a favorite scene. If you had ever seen Happy Gilmore on T.V, you might remember a scene with Happy talking to that guy that ""takes"" care of his Granmom. I guess she told Happy that he was treating her like trash. Then the guy says that she goes insane constsantly, then Happy punches him out the window of the big tall retirement place. That was my favorite scene. It is not on either the VHS or DVD. It was on T.V not that long ago and I watched it. But when I watched carefully through my VHS and DVD to see if it was there,... But it was MISSING!"
3,GOOD (NOT GREAT) COMEDY,"WHO HASN'T BEEN LOOKING FOR AN INSANE GOLF COMEDY THAT INCLUDES: A PSYCHO HOCKEY PLAYER TURNED GOLFER DUE TO HIS INABILITY TO ICE SKATE, AN OBSESSED GOLFER, A FREAK WITH A RUSTY NAIL STUCK IN HIS HEAD, A SWEET GRANDMA, A GOLF LEGEND WITH A WOODEN HAND, THE 70 YEAR OLD (+) HOST OF ""THE PRICE IS RIGHT"" SHOWING MORE MOVES THEN ALI, A SEVERED ALLIGATORS HEAD, A MIDGET IN GILMORE'S HAPPY PLACE, AN ABUSIVE NURSING HOME WORKER, AND DOZENS OF OTHER BIZAARE THINGS. ALL THOUGH ""HAPPY GILMORE"" IS NOT THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT IS CRITICLY ACCLAIMED BY PRO CRITIC'S. IT IS A CROWD PLEASER FOR ANY GENERAL AUDIENCE AGES 13+."
4,one of adam sandler's best,"adam sandler is far from the brightest star in the SNL pantheon. even brighter lights like eddie murphy, dan akroyd and chevy chase have had spotty movie output, and sandler has made some serious stinkers. but this goofy movie about a ""regular joe"" beer-drinking hockey player who storms the golf world is in sandler's sweet spot. good silly movie though not to be confused with masterpieces like caddy shack, meatballs or wedding crashers. older kids will love it but beware some serious swearing!"
1,Not suggested for people who don't like crude humor,"It's the crude Adam Sandler humor. It had a great idea for a story line, but Adam has a way to ruining that warm and fuzzy feeling of do good movies."
2,The Adam Sandler my brother enjoys,"Altogether too crude for my taste. Sorry. I prefer more character, less of everything that makes Sandler appeal to the 18_24 male demographic."
5,Happy Gilmore,There is nothing that I would of liked to know. I am very pleased with this product and it was a very speedy delivery. I had a wonderful experience with Amazon I have ordered several movies from Amazon and I am very pleased. I recomened Amazon to all of my friends and family.Thank You
3,Funny but uneven,"Adam Sandler films are a guilty pleasure. His characters, like Happy, are generally very gimmicky, and the jokes are one sided. With ""Happy Gilmore,"" he barely pulls it off. The films funnier moments are the surreal ones (like when Happy dreamworld includes a midget riding a broom like a pony), and the Bob Barker scene really isn't that funny. This is light humor."
4,One of the best comedies of the 90's generation!,"Adam Sandler stars in one of the most funniest movies I have ever seen. A cocky hockey player who turns pro golfer. Adam Sandler wisecrack jokes and comments bring out endless laughs through this whole movie. Funny for people ages 16-25, the younger generation and golf fans absolutely love this hilarious comedy which is up with the ranks of caddy shack. Tons of wisecracking comments and jokes a real laugh out loud comedy. DVD version is ok, not great, it was kind of cool to see the trailers and I like the full screen format of the movie, that is a good feature. All in All, awesome"
1,Love the Movie But Hate the DVD!,I Love the movie but hate the DVD! How could they not have also released a widescreen version for Happy Gilmore?If this DVD also included a widescreen option I would give it 5 stars so Please also do a widescreen DVD!
5,A good laugh!,"Hilarious! Hilarious! Oh yes, did I forget to mention that this movie is HILARIOUS!!!!!!! Everyone in this movie is funny and sweet, except for Bob Barker, Shooter McGavin, and the Nursing Home Orderly. I enjoyed every minute of the movie. YOU GOTTA SEE IT!!!"
5,Adams' best work!,This was the first Adam Sandler movie i saw and i couldnt stop laughing. This is diffinitly one of my favorite movies and you should buy it!
2,Fabric of this World,"This is a fascinating read on the history of work and how we have evolved culturally to our current mentality of vocation. It gives a Christian perspective on calling and how this fits in Western culture. Fairly heavy reading, but very interesting."
3,Please don't support business practices like these.,"I'm tired of studios releasing a few episodes on a disc and giving it a fancy name, then later on releasing the entire season on DVD to force the kids to buy something twice if they want all the episodes.Support FULL-SEASON releases ONLY and they will stop these shady practices of double dipping the consumer (namely kids in most cases). Usually the full season release is much cheaper than buying seperate ""volumes"" anyways."
1,"Great show, but don't buy this","Like others have said, this just is not worth buying. They should release the whole season for $20, not some episodes for $15. thats just dumb."
5,My 3 year old grandson loved this movie!,"He loves all Spider-Man movies. This was the first one I purchased for him and he hasn't stopped talking about it. He now refers to this movie as ""Spider-Man's big fight with the Green Lizard."" He loves it."
5,Edge Guard,Keep your fingers safe and keep from damaging your other knives cant say much more about this but product but just take care of your investments.
5,A New Creation...a promise and a way to live,"I first purchasedBodyPrayer: The Posture of Intimacy with Godand was so impressed, I wanted to see what else the author might have written. Growing up Catholic, and now at a staid and true Presbyterian church, I am a mixed bag at best. Pagitt and the Solomon's Porch group show that worship is as diverse as creation, and community isn't something you pay your taxes for someonelse to maintain. Great narratives from fellow pilgrims. My first reading on the emergent church, and now I'm wanting to learn more. Inspirational and easy to read...you feel you know the author as a real person trying to live REAL, and for him, the Word is ALIVE."
3,Could be better,"PROS: The little metal closure on the front is nice and they include a matching black wrist strap. There's a belt loop on the back but really, who would wear it on their belt? You might as well strap on a pager. The nicest bonus is on the inside where there's a discreet card holder sewn in.CONS: The case is not as slim as I had hoped. It practically doubles the thickness of the camera. And the top flap doesn't fit as snug as it should. Overall, the case feels like it was meant for a slightly larger camera. The enclosure is velcro not magnetic, making it feel cheap despite the nice metal detail.The inside color is brown with brown thread."
4,Getting Old,"It's an amazing book that does ""covers a lot of good topics"", but it's getting outdated. Is a new edition on the way?"
3,Vietnam Vet baseball cap,Very nice cap for the price. But I do not think most Vietnam Vets want a cap made in China. Had I know that I would not have ordered it.
5,Finally in the Open,"From a practical standpoint, this cap is well made and good looking. From a more personal standpoint, the men who for so long hid their service in this war can finally receive some healing. After being spit on when he came home in 1972, my husband was thanked by a complete stranger in WalMart last week. A fringe benefit neither of us ever expected."
3,A promising talent,"""A Promise of Spring"" is an early work by the superb Mary Balogh and shows promise of the excellence to come. The theme of a newly married couple learning to communicate is enhanced by a few unusual touches: Grace is ten years older than Perry, and has a past that she has not overcome, though Perry, with surprising maturity for his age and era, takes it in stride. Perry is the more interesting character, though the focus is on the heroine. This is a Regency romance in which the hero is not interested in traditional masculine roles and allows an unheard-of amount of freedom to his wife. I'm not sure that comes off well. It seems like too much of an anomaly, particularly for so young a man. But it is an emotional read and also includes many secondary characters who reappear in later books, and I consider it a good book if not a great one."
1,Her age was mentioned over and over and over and over,"SPOILER! Marriage of convenience between 25-year-old man & lady 10 years older than him. Although I'm sure the age gap would have been a big issue back in the day, but did it have to be mentioned in the story every few pages? The story ran for a period of 2 1/2 years, and yes, her age was brought up all the time. 2 1/2 years of insecurity on her part.Unfortunately, I did not like this story due to this repetitive issue - it kept distracting me from the storyline so much that I felt that the heroine's insecurity of her age was essentially the main idea of this story."
5,Very Pleasant,this puzzle has large enough pieces that myself and all my grandkids can help put it together. It will stay on a large cardboard bottom where it can easily be moved but we all have fun by walking by it and stopping to find a few pieces to put together. very enjoyable time for the whole family.
3,Nice,"I think what i love most about this video is that the teacher is a wonderful conceptual artist. She brings imagination and freedom to the dance. This video is wonderful for any level of dancer who wants a different perspective or needs a pathway to freedom. If you are coming out of basic belly dance movements, i think this video would make a wonderful transition from drilling to dancing. I like the way this teacher explains things. I liked the choreography but hated the song, which made it hard for me to want to keep trying the choreography. Other than that, i think this video is great for beggining to intermediate dancers or for any dancer who wants a fresh perspective on movement. Very nice."
4,Better than I expected (from collegiate selections),"I listen to the last two songs (Ain't Got Time to Die & Wade in the Water) over and over and over again. Selections 5, 7, 10, 16, and 17 are great for sing-along. Seven more still have appeal. 14 of 19 - a better than average CD!"
3,A Little Too Classical for Me,"I love spirituals and knew the names of these choirs. What I was a little disappointed with is that the selections were a bit too ""classically orchestrated"" for me. I had hoped that the music would more nearly reflect the sounds of the original spirituals, but, the musicians were very talented and the selection of music was good."
2,Not so good,"My brother and I bought this book and used it to plan our biking trip in the Maritimes in 2001, but we weren't too happy with the route selection. Too many of the suggested routes were on main roads that were too busy with traffic. Bike touring is best when you get off the main roads, but this book doesn't help you find them. If you go to PEI, I do recommend that you bike on the clay roads that the book recommends. Don't follow the coastal roads--too much traffic. I like the Maritimes, in spite of this book!"
5,21 Tours Geared for Discovery!,"Invaluable information, even if you're not going to use the exact roads mentioned.Use this one as the best planning source available and well worth the small investment."
4,Vitamin shoppe,"Vitamin Shoppe - Cranberry Actio[[ASIN:B00012NC70 Vitamin Shoppe - Calcium Citrate + Magnesium & Vitamin D, 600 capsulesn, 300 softgels]]"
3,Lots of detail,I grew up in a large Irish Catholic family in the fifties and was looking forward to the story of this family. I was disappointed in the great detail about all the contests won (and lost) and would have liked less contest detail and more substance to the family story.
4,Nice story!,"I really enjoyed this book. As a true memoir it was a fascinating glimpse into the culture of the '50s and the Contesters! The father's alcoholism was addressed as the underlying cause of the family's financial ills, but the man was not demonized, which was refreshing. I admired the author's loving, yet realistic, remembrance of what must have been, in many ways, a difficult childhood."
2,Poorly written.,"The only redeeming part of the book was the epilogue. It had the potential to be a good story, but was never developed. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Pass on this one,"I expected this book to be more fulfilling and entertaining. It wasn't. It was more of a collection of stories and ditties taped together with the requisite alcoholic father and poverty. I've read many, many other similar tales that were better crafted. Couldn't wait to get to the end so I could get this book club pick behind me."
4,Please judge this book by its cover!,"This is a great book about a lady who was a ""sweeper"" back in the 1950's. She managed to keep her family of 10 children afloat by winning prizes from contests. Every $1 win helped with the family finances and the big wins.....the grocery spree ($4,000 with today's dollar value), a new sports car, and $5,000 ($35,000 with today's dollar value.....really helped the family out! I highly recommend this book!"
5,A moving and entertaining memoir with depth,"This is one of the best family memoirs I've ever read. I laughed, cried and cheered this woman of courage, wit and faith. Why watch a C+ movie? Read the A+ book for the real Evelyn who was so much deeper than just a chipper housewife with a knack for winning contests."
1,Such a SNOOZE!,"The whit wasn't catchy & neither was the book. I suffered through the first 5 chapters, then put myself out of my misery by tossing this one in the donation pile!"
2,This story could have been told in 25 words or less,"I found it depressing and way too long. Instead of admiration for the heroine, I felt aggravation. An abusive alcoholic for a husband, no way to make ends meet except the occasional contest win, for items that had no use to the family--Arthur Murray Dancing Shoes, for example. Barely able to feed the kids she already has, she eventually has 10. I know women lived differently in the 50's, still, most learned to drive a car! With so many little ones, it seems to me irresponsible to not be able to drive, esp. with all the emergencies in this very dysfuntional family. I kept waiting for the part when she would throw the bum out, obtain an education or job skills and show her family how to survive on more than luck and corny jingles."
4,The Prize Winner,This is an Amazon purchase for my Kindle. This was a delightful book to read. The perserverance of the author is incredible and the description of the family is wonderful. Truly an inspirational read.
5,As inspirational a book as the Holy Bible. . .,"I don't have enough positive things to say about this book. I have cried tears, I have laughed so hard I had to put the book down to compose myself. If you are a mother, if you are a writer, if you are poor, if you are downtrodden, if you feel hopeless, do yourself a favor and read this book. My copy is in tatters. I have dropped it in the tub so many times it's the size of the Yellow Pages. The author (Terry Ryan, daughter of Evelyn Ryan) has since passed away. Before she died, I wrote her telling her how much I love her book, it has changed my life."
4,As good as I thought it would be,I first heard of this book on the Today Show. Then I happened to run across the movie on HBO. It is a good quick read.
4,Inspirational and a page-turner,"Has anyone seen the movie yet? I hope it is true to the book. The real-life characters are REAL and the author brings the 1950-1960s era to life! I really loved the mother and her quick prose while ironing...she saved the family from homelessness many times! You'll like it, but it's a clean, family fun memoir. No gossip, no sex, no violence....nice for a change!"
3,Cute easy read,I enjoyed reading about the exploits of the mom and family and how she was able to pull the family out of the depths of despair with her winnings. This is a nice little memoir and made me want to enter some contests myself.
5,more amazing than fiction,"You will never read of another person quite as unique as Evelyn Ryan. Her imagination was far beyond what most of us can only begin to visualize. She kept her family together by the sheer force of her will and the incredible scope of her intuition. Her husband was an alcoholic,and at times, he was abusive to Evelyn. She remained steadfast throughout, raising their ten children with love and courage. Her genius was the ability to write winning slogans and jingles for advertising contests. Evelyn supported her family for many years by winning prizes. If necessary, the prizes were sold for much-needed cash. This heartwarming true story was written by Evelyn's daughter, Terry ""Tuffy"" Ryan."
5,"The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio","In this charming memoir, Terry Ryan details the life of a busy household, growing up as one of 10 children in Defiance, Ohio. Raised by a mother who has a knack with words and jingles, and a father who is an alcoholic, Terry Ryan lets us in to her family life and how her mother struggled to make ends meet by entering contests and winning prizes for her family.Not only is the book jam packed with old contests and jingles, it is laced with heartfelt humor and triumph. Terry's mother is a woman, who after reading this story, you can't help but love, admire and respect. The Ryan family will stay with you, and there are a lot of laugh out loud moments. A great, wholesome read~"
5,"Finally some Original music, from the BIG corpmusic world","These guys ( I think the drummer is female, though) rock"
4,"Not perfect, but acceptable.","My product was shipped overseas. Took about 2-3 weeks for delivery from England to FL, US. Upon receiving it, the packaging was acceptable. The book I ordered bent at the corners and the spine ripped an inch from the outside in. The contents of the book remains intact. All and all, it's a trustworthy source."
4,diagrams please,"I was thrilled to find this book because it includes instructions for the ""Butterfly Ball"" (which I have been looking for for a while now) plus it has a nice selection of other models as well. I'd like it much better, however, if it had diagrams instead of photos. I'm an experienced folder, but I had trouble following the photographs. Several of the steps were unclear and it was really very difficult to see what to do in several of the models."
2,suction dish,"It does not stick to high chair tray, my grandson could pull it off and all the food went on the floor."
2,"Good for travel, but doesn't suction to tray",This bowl is great for travel but I wish it would suction to the high chair tray.
2,Poor Suction,"I bought this suctioned bowl and one other (the Sassy Baby Less Mess toddler bowl) hoping that one of them would actually stick. The Sassy Baby sticks slightly better than this one, BUT neither one of them really suctions that well on our high chair tray or wooden table. Suction seems to be better on our glass coffee table, but of course that's NOT where we need it! Note that the suction ring on the Munchin does not come off for washing so I assume the suction will just get worse due to drying out, but doubt I'll be using it very long since my daughter just throws it."
2,Suction sucks.,"We love the lid and the depth of the bowl, but the suction does not work very well. It took only seconds for my son to pull it off of the table and it does not suction to the highchair try at all."
5,Perfect,This bowl is perfect for toddlers just learning to use a fork.It stays put and they cannot pick it up and dump the food out!Love it!
2,Doesn't work well,"It's an okay product for traveling or storing food because of the lid, but it has to sit flat because the divider in the bowl doesn't come up high enough to keep contents separate (so I can't use it in my sons lunch box). As for the suction cup part that is supposed to keep it from sliding around, it works great on my kitchen counter but not on the plastic high chair or the wood dinning table."
2,Not Impressed,"We bought this for our toddler and instantly found out the bowl does not stick well to the high chair or the table. We decided to put it aside for when our child was older for a lunch. First week of pre-school we put some plain pasta with grated cheese in the bowl using the cover to secure it. When we unpacked the lunchbox after picking up from school that day, what a mess! Pretty bummed we can't find anything that works that well. Love the concept though."
3,Cups not great,"The idea behind these cups is a good one. But they just don't deliver. I used them on my twins highchairs (plastic trays - not wooden) and they stuck on great -- for about 60 seconds. Unfortunately, my children take a little longer than 60 seconds to finish their food. So I find that I am constantly re-sticking them on. Not worth the $$."
2,suction doesn't last long,The suction cup on this bowl doesn't work on the SVAN high chair plastic tray. My son threw the bowl and the Cheerios in it all over the floor the first time he used it.
5,Good plate for toddler,Wish the suction worked a little better but overall its a nice size for a toddler meal
2,Didn't stick to highchair tray,"The first thing DD did was to toss this off her tray. The suction bowl didn't stick to the tray. It could be because her tray is wooden, and it may work better with plastic trays.On the plus side, it comes with a lid which is handy."
5,my lovely kitchen windows,"I had already bought the curtains for my kitchen, soon realizing the one window didn't have a full enough curtain. Getting this last set made them look perfect. Am so enjoying my kitchen."
1,Horrible.,"Any text that advises poverty-stricken Africans to use solar-powered stoves as opposed to wood-burning fires to cook their food in attempt to lower energy consumption has gone too far off the deep end as to be a suitable college source.Too many typos, too opinionated in the wrong places, not opinionated enough in the right places, just horrible. Wretched book. And to think, my family spent over $100 on the package. Ack![Ask your prof to use one of the labs to research better textbooks if this is all he/she can come up with.]"
1,bad,very outdated book... I ordered a hard cover book but I got a soft cover book. what else can I say....
4,A Pack Ready Meals,"I bought these for an upcoming elk hunt so I thought I would try one before the trip. I tried the chicken and spanish rice, overall I was satisfied, keep in mind this is pure camping food or emergency food nothing more. If you are looking for Ruth Chris prepare to be dissapointed.The only thing I couldn't eat was the raisins, wow are they bad! I love raisins, but these are dipped in some type of oil, I wouldn't call it motor oil but damn close!The rest is as expected, product arrived quickly."
5,it's simply wonderful....,"....and I don't only say because I live in Harlem. It's a marvellous collection of wonderfully soulful tunes that capture the essence of an era perfectly. There aren't enough adjectives to give this justice, so just buy it. Don't let the title (blaxploitation) put you off, this is really great music which stands on it's own. I've had this for a long time and listen to it frequently. A great double mix-tape, I commend whoever compiled it. Good stuff..."
3,It just ends....,"While there was a pretty good build up of the characters and the story was peppered with some mystery, lies and bit of action, I knew with only 35 pages left that there was no way this book could end gracefully. There is no ending because this story has basically been split into two books. Once a Thief is the first half and book two titled Always a Thief is the second half. I have started Always a Thief and it picks right up were Once a Thief left off. If you plan to buy One a Thief you need to buy Always a Thief at the same time."
3,Good...but a disappointment,"the book was well written but it could have been a lot better. it was supposed to be about morgan and quinn, which it did start out as, but as soon as storm was brought into the story it then became about wolfe and storm. morgan was then mentioned every now and then, but mostly as a go between referee for wolfe and storm. i also didn't like at the end how it started a new story . it's confusing and it leaves you hanging."
2,What happened to ending one story before starting another?,"I usually enjoy Kay Hooper's books, and I probably enjoyed this one the first time around. But this book has left me confused. Normally we have one set of primary characters whose story concludes at the end of the book. Who was the Primary here: Morgan and Quinn or Storm and Wolfe?And if I have to wait to next summer for the book to end, will I even care? I don't mind waiting a month or two, but six months is a bit long. Why not make just one little larger book with both sets of characters, but give me an ending, please."
2,less than typical Romantic Suspense.....,"other reviewers have covered the storyline well, so I'll add just a few points.1-almost no storyline-just jumping between the TWO couples interacting, or fighting, with each other. There was not enough story for one couple, much less two. Even with that, none of the characters worked together-they just argued, and then made out, of course.2-inconsistencies-for supposedly modern, intelligent characters, the author has them doing implausible, immature actions. The biggest wrong move-the heroine-whose the exhibit curator, who says she'll do anything to protect the exhibit, but she immediately falls for the thief who plainly states he's going to ransack the exhibit? Save me from stupid heroines!not recommended-1.5 stars."
1,no story and no ending,I have to agree with those readers who are insulted by the poor writing in this latest effort by Kay Hooper. In addition to there being very little plot we are expected to shell out [more of our hard earned cash] to find the conclusion of this story. If Hooper wanted to receive [profit] for her book it would have been more honest had she produced one volume and allowed readers to decide wether to pay for her story. She might also have let readers know that this is a reissue. I will not pay for the second installment of this reissued garbage.
1,Disappointed!!!!,"This is typical Kay Hooper material which I normally like. Strong-minded females meet equally strong-minded males, you know what happens. What really ticked me off was the fact that this is only HALF a book. In order to find out what happens to the storyline - thieves are trying to steal Max Bannister's priceless collection of jewells - you have to buy the next book - Always a Thief. The book just ends with no resolution, just in the middle of the story..."
4,To The Dazed And Confused !!!,"For those of you Kay Hooper fans, Once A Thief may seem abit confusing. There is a reason for this, this story is a kindof repeat. Kay Hooper wrote FOUR stories for Loveswept Books in 1993. She called it the ""Men Of Mysteries Past"" series. Thesebook titles were ""The Touch Of Max"", ""Hunting The Wolf"", ""TheTrouble With Jared"", and ""All For Quin"".Once A Thief, Is a kind of combination of the first two books.This is not a reprint exactly. There are just different in-depthdetails that you did not get in the origial publication.I really enjoyed this book because it expanded on a story thatI really love to read. I hope this helps to explain the confusionof more than one sub plot, because there are several there to keep you guessing. By the way you will love the ending!!!!"
2,"When I Read A Book, I Expect An Ending","I couldn't wait for the opportunity to write this review!!! I travel a lot in my job, so I keep a book with me for airport waits & to fill time between meetings. I made the mistake of buying 'Once A Thief'. Not only did it contain characters that were never developed (there is great potential), but a story line that was left dangling as well. I am a bit resentful about having purchased a book with no conclusion. The fact that it was a two part story should have been made obvious so that I could determine whether it was a reasonable purchase at the time. Better yet, why not just wait until the characters are developed and there is an ending and put it all in one book?At the end of the book I sat in the airport feeling unsatified and tricked."
2,Not the best read.,Kay Hooper creates many good stories but this is not one of them. The product itself was in flawless shape. Just not a good book.
2,Murder in Coweta County,Amazon had a rating of very good quality.The product that I received was a very poor quality. It was scratchy and streaked.It was jumpy and I could not get this out by adjusting the tracking.I would probably never buy another used product from Amazon. Rating is not to be trusted.
3,VHS Tape,"Product was basically as stated, but was expensive for the age and condition. Took several weeks to arrive, but could have been due to the Christmas rush."
1,Nothing like the Preview,"This movie was a waste of money. It is not scary at all, which from the preview was expected. There is nothing but bad attempts of trying to make you laugh. If I had known what this movie was like I would of never of paid for a ticket. No laughs, no jumps just a waste of time. I rather sit and watch something as bad as The Spirit then watch this ever again."
2,R U really Sam? That Sam?,"After I watched this film, I was pretty much upset.I didn't expect watching movies like Omen. A serious horror.But this one doesn't have anything inside. Not like Evil Dead, this one losts it's way from the very beginning.Also I didn't find a single reason why I should like the actress. She is just faceless.Also the result is pretty easy to figure from the very beginning.I hate to say this but, Sam, stop pretending to be an independent horror film director anymore. You lost your own color!"
4,It's a horror movie,It's a fun movie. Try not to think too much about the plot. Just watch it. Let all the plot holes go. Enjoy the gore. Try not to think of Apple products.
2,A big dissapointment,"First let me say that I am a big Evil Dead Trilogy fan and I had such high expectations for this film after reading the press reviews. But after actually seeing the movie for myself, it is quite a let down. The humor you read about just isn't here, I did not laugh once during this movie. There are no memorable lines worth quoting as there are in Sam's other horror classics. And oh, the horror, of a goat and an old lady with no teeth! Are you kidding me. Also, if you are like me, you will see the twist at the end coming a mile away. The acting was ok but nothing memorable there either. Save your money and rent this one and then go out a buy Trick r Treat, it is everything this movie tries to be. Sorry Sam Raimi but you are no longer the king."
1,Disgusting crap,"This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. And I LOVE horror movies. It started out great...and i had high expectations. But very shortly, the main character showed herself to be unlikeable, stupid and two dimensional. This movie was less gory than oozy, wormy and just gross, and not in the good way. It had some decent special effects, I will give it that. But by the end, my boyfriend and I were yelling at the tv...""Just drag her to hell!! We dont care anymore!!"""
1,The WrestleDude's 2nd Halloween Special Review,"It's a confused mess at best. The jump scares get real old after the first 10 times thus making them predictable. I mean it's like one jump scare after another with little-to-no quiet moments. The leads are bland and the rest are forgettable. The villian is 1D at best. The ending is phoned in a mile away. The only A+ in this film that it does try to scare you and it does have scary images,unlike Exorcist 2. Overall,it's nothing more then a Evil Dead wannabe that fails to be funny. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Drag me away from this movie,"Terrible. Simply terrible. Not scary, not funny, poorly acted. I really gave up when she released the anvil that was suspended from the ceiling. Are you kidding me - an ANVIL? Didn't know if I was watching a horror movie or a Road Runner cartoon. This was so hokey, so lame. I was also surprised to see just how bad the effects were. I thought Sam Raimi had reached the level where he could afford the best and put it on screen. I guess not. Definately avoid this movie."
2,I'd like to be dragged to hell... after watching this movie.,"This movie started out with promise. There were some scenes that made me jump and shocked me a bit, but I found myself laughing at the cheesy flick more than anything.An eyeball in her cake watching her, the demon spitting her dead cat at her, an old gypsy taking out her dentures and gumming her to death. these things combined to make nothing more than a silly movie that took itself to seriously.My advice... skip it."
2,Ehhh,"I'm actually shocked at the number of positive reviews this movie is getting. I feel as if it could have been sooo much better, but the movie seemed a bit overdone. It could have been so much more. She just wasn't a believable character.The reason I gave the movie 2 stars is because I liked the ending. The rest of the movie was a bust."
2,I want to like it.,I was so excited when I went to see this movie in theater. It didn't do much for me though. It has some parts that did scare me. But I've seen better scary movies.
3,"youthful, gross out movie","Sylvia Ganush does some terrible things to Allison Loehmann's character whenever they are face to face. This movie feels young like Final Destination despite being made by now established auteur, Sam Raimi. It's polished and fast-paced. Apart from the tete a tete scenes, what remains with me from this movie is that not even the love of mensch will protect you."
3,Fun Funny Horror Movie,This movie really didn't scare me but it was funny and a fun flick to watch. It took me a while to realize this is the chick from Matchstick Men. All it all I had a good time watching it.
2,DRAG ME TO HELL,"THIS STARTED OUT AS A GOOD MOVIE, BUT THE STUPID OVERDONE STUNTS BROUGHT IT DOWN. IT IS OK TO BUY IT USED, BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING IT NEW."
5,Scary enough!,When this was at the theaters I chickened out on going to see it(don't like people hearing my girl scream)so as soon as I stumbled on it on Amazon I had to buy it.I really like Justin Long and think he's a very good actor.
4,Classic Sam Raimi,If you are a fan of The Evil Dead 2 then you'll want to see this one. I won't go as far as saying it is as good as that cult classic but it's a close second. Maybe not quite as much hammy humor but it delivers the goods on the over-the-top gore (gory in that Evil Dead kind of way). Sammy also has more budget to work with here as well. Nice twist (you knew SOMETHING had to happen) at the end.
2,not that good,"This movie is not very good. There are some scenes that make you jump, but for the most part, it just drags thru. I wouldn't add it to a collection of my best films or even mediocre ones at that."
1,Drag me to hell,The advertise of movies made it look good. I am a horror freak and this was not all that. This movie lacked in the story line. I would not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Big horror fan, worst big production horror movie in years",From the beginning the movie/director shows you that the movie is not very well made. The first scene is so badly done I was very close to walking out of the theatre. Like many of sam raimi's movies they are ruined by his bad sense of humor. The girl in the movie gets cursed by this rediculous character (old witch lady) and then tries to get the curse lifted by a fortune teller. The old woman then goes on to puke on here and gum her to death. Sadly I'm not exagerrating.The plot line is boring. None of the characters you care about. Not just because the acting is bad its more because the characters motives are so genuinely lame that you can't understand where they are coming from or where they got their common sense. And the ending was just painful. Overrall I would say if you like sam raimi's movie like quick in the dead or evil dead then you might like this movie.
1,Tacky Gross-Out Movie,"After reading all the rave reviews, I bought a copy of this DVD. It was a major disappointment. It's nothing but a sadistic (torture and animal murder) gross-out movie aimed at teenage boys. The production looks cheap - it's loaded with cliches, and the villain is a repulsive witch. The film is loaded with old age stereotypes, snobby yuppies. I urge everyone to watch a classic Hammer film or something with genuine style - not this potboiler!"
2,"Disappointing - Rent, Do Not Own","As a fan of Raimi films and the horror genre, I was rather disappointed by this predictable film. The ending was easily seen when the 2nd sealed envelope was created. The gypsy woman was not set up properly as a sympathetic character. In fact, the main character was more victim than the gypsy witch, and the 'romance' seemed tacked on and lacked believable chemistry between the 2 actors. There were many spots where FFWD is needed just to skip to some action. The graphics (in the action/attack scenes) were decent, and the diner scene at least had a true 'moral' element.But this is best as a rental, not a full purchase. Or at least wait until a bargain bin sale. Especially given the paltry bonus features. I regret gambling the full DVD purchase price."
3,"BUY THE RECOMMENDATIONS I MADE, THIS MOVIE WAS NOT SCARY!","DRAG ME TO HELL WAS OK, THE ACTING WAS NOT THE GREATEST...OVE RTHE TOP PERFORMANCES DOES NOT MAKE YOU A GOOD ACTOR. I THINK THE HYPE OF THE FILM IS WHAT SOLD THIS PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO ALL THE HYPE. 2 OF THE ACTORS WEE IN 3 OF MY FEATURE FILMS.

2,A Lot of Spit,"As a fanatic with so many versions of Evil Dead films that my family threatenedintervention, I looked forward to Drag Me to Hell. I saw the opening sequence, and thought, ""This is going to be good."" I was oh...so...wrong.It seems that the road to hell is not paved with good, intentions, flying limbs,terrifying monsters, or anything remotely interesting. It is paved with mucus.That's right. I won't say it again, though the movie did, ad nauseum. Yes, I said it. (I watched the unrated cut. The theatrical might have less. I didn't check.)The surprise trick ending was right out of those Victorian fireside tales. In other words, so fresh.It doesn't seem like I wanted to like this film, but I really, really did.Especially as I had bought it.Why 2 stars? Well, Alison Lohman did a good job, and looked like she was really put through it. The rest of the cast was good, too, in the minutes they wereonscreen. And I liked the seance."
3,Bad Ending,"Movie is kind of creepy, and kind of realistic. Scary. It could happen. But, the ending is very bad. I can't stand the way they ended this movie..."
2,Leave old ladies alone!,"If you are an actor/actress and are offered a role in such a movie, then it's a sign that your career is going down!In short, an old lady cast a spell on a bank employee who refuses to extend her another chance to keep her house. Yeah, there is surprising scenes of the old lady throwing up on different occasions and sucking on her chin after losing her dentures, so in short it's kind of disgusting not suspenseful.I suggest that you don't bug us old ladies, and most importantly don't use us in stupid movies!"
3,"It was a good idea, but","I liked the idea of this movie, but the movie, to me, was just ok. The special affects were not very good. Some people-in the theater, were actually laughing at the so call scary parts in this movie, I was just kind of bored."
2,Luke warm ...,"This movie could have been good, you have 2 good actors trying to slush out a good performance with this low brow, attempt at entertainment, this movie drags you to sleep with the goof ball antics, half wit attempts at a story line and wasted CGILets also mention the ho hum cliché's. The heroin in this movie doesn't really make you care about what happens to her if the movie was 30 min or 3 hours you wouldn't care if she got dragged to a chain gang let alone hell, in fact you wish she got dragged there sooner so you could leave this crapfest of a movie.... Watching my 1 year old blow spit bubbles is more entertaining."
2,dissapointed!!!,this is not the movie to carry on the evil dead mantel. go back to making superhero blockbusters for the masses sam. you peaked around evil dead II. what a letdown.
3,UUUUGGHH!!,I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS BEFORE ON PAY PER VIEW OR SOMETHING....BUT I DIDNT REMEMBER IT BEING THIS DISGUSTING. UNRATED NOT FOR ME....AND I LOVE LOVE LOVE HORROR
1,Just Stupid,"I love to be scared, I really do.But this movie was just silly, and stupid. The main character is so dumb that she is dumb beyone the normal stereotype of the female lead in a horror movie. If her acting wasn't bad enough, the stupid gags are even worse. For me the worst part was when we basically got a Looney Tunes gag thrown into the movie in the form of an anvil being suspended with a rope and pulley system and then dropped on the old gypsy lady's head. If that wasn't bad enough, then her eyes pop out of her head in the same cartoony effect that Wiley Coyote's do whenever a boulder/anvil drops on him in a Road Runner cartoon.This movie was not scary, and the writer relied too much on jump scares, which by the way I was able to call out every single one of them before they happened, and he also relied too much on vomit humor. Frankly he seemed to be more determined to gross his audience out rather than scare them.It was just stupid."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Being a horror movie fan, just the fact that a producer took a chance with a new horror flick I give them some props. That's where the 1 star comes from. This movie was full of boring scenes, bad acting, and way over the top drama (even for a horror flick). You probably could have added some good nudity with Alison Lohman and gotten away with having at least a small reason to endure this picture. I made the awful mistake of buying this movie on Blu-Ray before I even saw it. I should've taken note from what my friends who are into the horror genre said. I was a sucker and thought the trailer was convincing enough that it couldn't have been that bad of a movie. Boy was I wrong. At least I got a good deal off Amazon, considering."
1,Full of cliches including dead kitten,"After the ""heroine"" kills her kitten, I quit watching. At that point, I wanted the evil spirit to drag her to hell."
3,Deja Vue,Doesn't anyone else realize this is a remake of Curse of the Demon (also kown as Night of the Demon)?
3,...and Back!,"Kudos to Alison Lohman. She gets the Holy living crap beat out of her in this movie. Sam Raimi found such a good sport in the actress, and it's her willingness to participate that really sets this movie above others. The movie also succeeds on the direction from Sam Raimi with his return to form from his low-budget filmmmaking days. So many of the shots and edits in ""Hell"" reminds me of his work from the Evil Dead Trilogy. I'm still a little puzzled at the critical response to this movie. It's a solid entry in the horror genre, but not great as the critics would have you believe. But you could do a lot worse if you're looking for cheap Friday night thrills."
2,Redbox Rental,"This movie was horrible. I'm glad a redbox rental is only $1.00 per night. Do not purchase this movie, it is not worth your time!"
4,Fun for Raimi Fans,"If you are a fan of Sam Raimi flicks you will love this one. It is kind of like ""Evil Dead"" with some ""Casting the Runes/Curse of the Demon"" and ""Thinner"" all rolled up together. The ""jump"" shocks do get a little old as noted by some reviewers. If you like frenetic scares with a little humor thrown in this one is for you."
4,Sometimes The Good Die Young,"This post-""Spider-Man"" offering from Sam Raimi is not great but not bad entertainment. I would say that Raimi references ""Poltergeist"" by way of ""The Evil Dead"". Raimi intersperses real terror with some deliciously wicked dark humor. My favorite scene is where Christine(Alison Lohman) falls over the casket of the Gypsy woman who may or may not have put a curse on her and the corpse spews embalming fluid all over her. Our sense of horror is enhanced because the fetching Lohman makes for a sympathetic victim. My reservation is at times Raimi utilizes CGI to illicit terror. The effects look fake and doesn't even give you goosebumps."
3,Scary movie,"Good old-fashioned Saturday afternoon horror flick. Quick cuts, loud noises entertain and distract. A weak ending is the major drawback to this enjoyable B movie."
2,I didn't hate this movie...,"I just thought it was idiotic. The first scene with the kid was pretty cool but after that it was just tedious and poorly done from top to bottom. Bad special effects, bad acting, not scary, and just a little bit funny from time to time.One scene that stands out as being particularly bad was when she gets attacked by the old lady in her car. Okay I understand that her manager asked her to take a file home to review it. It was A FILE. Why did she have the entire contents of her desk with her. OH thats right to try to make the scene funny by having her fight the lady off with her stapler.And anyone who didn't see how this was going to end the moment the car stopped short and all the envelopes hit the floor. send me your address so I can come to your home and hit you on the head with a tack hammer and put you out of your misery."
3,not bad at all,this movie was not bad at all. but the teeth grossed me out.discusting. i think that was worse then gore. anyway a must see for horror fans. thank you
4,Wow! No one warned me this was part comedy!,"Seriously, I had no idea this movie would elicit some hearty belly laughs! And I'm not trying to make fun of the movie.... not directly anyway. The trailers for this movie never indicated this movie would be humorous nor do the descriptor tags on either IMDb or amazon say anything about this being kind of a comedy. And it really is, in the vein of ""House"" (1986 w/ William Katt) and ""Beetlejuice"" (1988). But if the creators of this movie never intended it to have so many laughs, then well...wow...reality check time, guys. The movie DOES have a few good ""gotcha"" make-you-jump moments, but mostly it has a lot of funny moments. Come on, those toothless spit-swapping mouth-to-mouth scenes can't be taken seriously! Anyhow, as long as you don't expect this to be a straightforward ""take me seriously"" horror flick, you should find reasons to find it enjoyable on some levels. I laughed during this movie more than I did watching Jack Black's ""Year One""."
2,*Spoiler Alert*,"Raimi, you had me right up to the point she sacrificed the kitten. Until then, it was a fun little throw-back gem, and I was having a blast. But that little bit of nastiness blew the whole thing for me. Sorry. I may be a seasoned die-hard horror junkie, but even I have a soft spot for little kitties. Completely unnecessary."
2,Drag me to Hell...or Anywhere to Stop Watching This...,"The comedy wasn't funny; the horror wasn't horrific. I'm stumped by those reviewers calling this ""hard-boiled"" horror. There is nothing remotely scary here. Over-the-top silly, yes (the gypsy in the parking garage scene), but frightening, no. I loved ""The Evil Dead,"" but found the two sequels insulting to the original. I know there are multitudes that love ""Army of Darkness,"" but it just never worked for me. As for ""Hell,"" there is one clever plot twist, but that's about it. I was gravely disappointed after reading good reviews. I'll stick with ""American Werewolf..."" instead."
1,"Do not watch while eating. >_< Disgusting gags, too.","Too much emphasis on disgusting gags. And ""gag"" is an apt word of choice, as that's exactly what I did in at least a couple of particularly stomach wrenching scenes. @_@ The chances of me actually sitting through the entire movie are slim to none.Perhaps if I had the option to actually skip without seeing disgusting things, perhaps I'd be more charitable with this film."
1,I want to watch horror movies that actually scare me!,"When Drag Me to Hell first came out I saw the previews,but didn't go and see it in the theater. I thought it didn't look very good,but that it might be just 'okay'.My mother loves horror movies also,and she had bought it on pay-per-view. She kept telling me I had to see it. She said that someone she knew had to leave the theater because they couldn't handle how scary it was!Well,I didn't end up watching it until it premiered on television and I could not believe how horrible it was! It was so silly and cartoonish I was utterly shocked. The writer of this script,did they mean for it to be a horror-comedy? Probably not. I think it's just bad film-making.Quite a few of the scenes in the movie focused on these wild special effects that made me think of looney tunes cartoons. It needed way more intelligence to do it for me. The movie ended up being several times worse than I would have ever thought."
2,Gag Me to Hell,"I love Sam Raimi from the very first Evil Dead I saw when I was a teenager but this movie had not one scare in it at all....it was over the top gore and special effects that weren't the least bit scary or funny. And the acting was awful, and the story line predictable...I just don't get why so many people liked this...."
4,Back to school for you.,Good movie. Don't give things bad reviews when it is you that needs improvement. Drag yourself back to school if you don't like it.
2,Bombed in the box office for a reason: word of mouth,"This is an OLD script of Sam's, one that he had written during his ARMY OF DARKNESS (another poorly received film)days.In no way does it equal THE EVIL DEAD 2 for ""horror-comedy"". This simply isn't a very ""interesting"" or compelling film, which is why it died in the box office.Rent it if you must, but don't buy it -- and you'll notice that Sam barely appears on the ""special features."" If he really loved this film, he'd be all over the extras like he is on EVIL DEAD 1 & 2.Not this time."
2,Please Drag Us To A More Entertaining Hell Next Time Sam,"Take a part of Thinner, hence a curse, part Evil Dead, cartoonish violence and a strong lead aka a female Ash. Stir well and serve it out to the easily pleased.I don't know what's wrong with Sam Raimi lately, he's lost his horror edge.The Spiderman films were fantastic as was Darkman, maybe he should stick to superhero films from now on.What is it with horror films today, don't they make them for adults anymore?"
2,Lots of Barfing,"This movie was a blind rent, based on some good reviews on this site. Unfortunately, it was a terrible blind rent. The movie itself had an interesting premise, but the execution came off as cheesy and forgettable. Most of the scare tactics involve some type of vomiting, or bugs. While the ending comes as unexpected, it does not make up for the rest of the 2 hours of my life that was wasted watching it. Please, look elsewhere if you're looking to be scared, and reserve this movie for a laugh with some drunk friends. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because I felt pity for the main actress, who wasn't entirely terrible. Justin Long came across as a Mac AD, with an iPhone and iMac on his desk, and a forgettable backstory.Boo"
1,A poor movie choice,A waste of time and money. I do not recommend this movie to anyone of any age. Better choices for fun scary movies are out there.
1,DVD didnt work :(,When i put the disk into my DVD player it wouldn't work. after further inspection of the disk it said that it was a dvd-rom and only suitable for a computer.... This was not what i ordered. i was upset because this was a Christmas gift.... I will be returning this item
1,Technical Issue,"The movie itself is very good. The problem is that this dvd does not work in this ""region"" (the US). This needs to be very clear in the add...large print and highlited. Until now I didn't know dvds had regions. What a pain. I had to change over my computer's region to the UK to watch it and then change it back afterwards. I can only do that 4 times according to the computer. Would not run on my dvd player at all."
5,CREEPY,I love creepy movies and this was creepy! Loved the twisted ending! I can't stop talking about it. Very good
4,A good horror film with an ironic ending,This is a riviting film that has you guessing until the final sceen. Just the right thing for you horror buffs out there.
4,Return of Sam Raimi to his horror film roots,"I was in high school when I watched Evil Dead, which was pretty scary for a horror movie. Sam Raimi directed that one and he returns to his horror roots with Drag me to hell. Alison Lohman is an assistant manager at a bank. She is forced to repossess the house of a woman who happens to be a gypsy. The gypsy goes and puts a curse on her.One of my favorite genre is horror and I can say I have seen hundreds of horror films. This movie will satisfy most horror film buffs as well as film lovers. The action is fast, the scary scenes are heart stopping and there is ample comedy. Four stars 10/10/10"
2,romeo must die,I purchased this movie only because I'm an admirer of Jet Li's ability to incorporate his martial arts skills into any genre of movie. There were some comical points in the movie but overall the plot was weak.
2,The type of movie u don't remember much about (2.5/5 stars),"This movie is nothing special, a week after u seen it u don't remember anything about the movie except for a lot of Kung-Fu kicks and that DMX was hardly in the movie...U can watch RUMBLE IN THE BRONX (Jackie Chan) if u want a kung-fu movie...The movie isn't bad but it isn't good either"
3,good production but not a believable story,Jet Li was quite impressive as an action guy and Aaliyah is quite attractive but they just don't light up the screen together. Their romance was too contrived. Not too mention that the general plot was a stretch.I had heard some negative comments about the soundtrack but I have to say that what I heard throughout the film was pretty good so i'll have to pick it up.And there's a major difference between veteran actors and singers. All you have to do is watch Isiah Washington's flawless performance and then look at Aaliyah and DMX. It's night and day. But I don't think that Isiah Wasington would be a very good musical artist. So the moral of the story is stick to what you know best.
2,Korny,"A virtual kitsch of gore and senseless action.It is supposed to take off from where Matrix left off but except for some hanging around suspended in the air, throwing around limbs,the film disintegrates into the thin air.With a story line that is as thick as the air in your garden it's no wonder that the fil relies entirley on action factor but falls flat on it's face"
4,treat for the eyes,It was one of the best movies i have seen recently.it was a great fun watching the movie.
3,zooming jet!,"""Romeo Must Die"" is a perfect movie for a weekend. Jet Lee is one of the many Asian actors who has not been given his due worth yet. The rivalry between the two families in U.S.was the basic parameter of the movie BUT definately worth a watch."
3,"Very Good, Bad Editing","Jet Li did really well at acting in this movie, and it's not his fault that the editing needs work. Alliyah and DMX also did a good job for a music artist celebrity, I mean, look at how bad Shaq (Shaq had a very bad rap albumn out) was at acting and look at them. The storyline is exciting, and it is good that this movie doesn't promote racism, but rather promotes unity. The fights could be a little better, but this movie has Hella funny scenes! The editing... Well, the movie sometimes looks like a 1960 Peter Pan Broadway show, as it looks like the characters are held by strings. Considering that the studio spent most of their money gettind DMX and Alliyah and didn't have a lot left for the graphics, they did an adequate job of what they had with them. Good luck next time Jet Li."
3,good movie lots of action but doesn't click,I would say the movie is well madee and the action is good as it is jet li movie but the concept doesn't get clear untill the end
3,big disappointment!,"This movie isn't even worth a rental. The acting was weak and I expected to see some great moves by Jet Li one of the finest at martial arts but those scences were far between and not enoough. Did jet no justice to his talents. The overall plot was boring, Hope Jet gets into a movie were he can really show off his talents."
4,hench film,"hey guy's you're wondering shall i buy this dvd right now are'nt you? thought so well hell yeahhh is the answer i know all of you guy's think aaliyah(rip) is fine and she is but jet is cute eye candy for us girls,i'd love to play aaliyahs charictor with the ghetto love thing goin on! it's full of action love and comedy and is fantastic like all jet movies, it also stars dmxand an actor from the jet li smash bodyguard from beijing( the defender) its cool great hench hevvy messy bad da bomb nne i say more? luv ya jet- j"
3,Romeo Must Die,"This movie is an attempt to integrate elements of the Hong Kong kung fu movie into the traditional Hollywood action hero movie, with unspectacular results. Jet Li is as solid as ever, given that he's starring in an American movie and has a limited command of English. Some of the fight scenes are very good. The plot, though is generic, as is, with the exception of Delroy Lindo, the supporting cast. ROMEO MUST DIE is not on par with the best of Li's work in Hong Kong, or even his most recent HK work, BLACK MASK. I'd recommend starting with THE LEGEND, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, then think about ROMEO MUST DIE."
1,WORST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE EVER MADE,"It begins with phony martial arts in a ghetto atmosphere of profanity (and not just the movie, I felt like letting a few words fly after paying for this!) and crummy dialogue. Then my finger hit the fast-forward button more times than my heart was beating.I wasn't asking for much. All I wanted was a movie along the lines of Van Damme. Some martial arts action with a semi-decent story. Instead I was so bored, especially with the ridiculous fight scenes (defying the laws of physics and common sense) and awful dialogue and story.This movie should be listed as fantasy. Howard the Duck was more believable than this thing.If you wanted to see realistic martial arts, you should've been at my house when I did the Crane as I was about to kick my TV in while this horrendous movie was playing."
2,entertaining but..........,"The movie is entertaining enough. Soundtrack is okay if you like that kind of music. The martial arts is very good, as can be expected of yet li. The story is ....... well, you all know Romeo and Juliet. Nothing else special to mention.You can spend 2 hour being entertained but don't expect a good plot. Just wait for the next fighting scene and you'll cope."
3,Where's the romance?,"A few things about this film really bothered me and brought my rating down. First, the fight scenes were shot from close range and edited too quickly to really show off Jet Li's martial arts talents. Second, the relationship between the two leads was more of a buddy relationship than a romantic/sexual one (not good in a film with a Romeo and Juliet reference in the title). Third, and this one is a SPOILER, the movie doesn't live up to the title. If you name a film ""Romeo Must Die"", then Romeo had better die."
3,terrible thriller,i generally like thrillers & all kinds of gory details but i didn't in this it was o.k if u'r boyfriend has let u high 'n dry.but if u'r still goin strong...then its best to avoid it.
3,Action Packed 'Romeo And Juliet'!,"This film offers great production design and admirable action sequences. It stars Kung Fu expert Jet Li in his first English-speaking role, he plays an escaped convict out for blood named Han (how original). The film also features the beautiful and promising Aaliyah as Li's love interest (Juliet, respectively) Aaliyah and Li have a kind of puppy-love chemistry that keeps the film above float between Li's fight sequences. All of the other supporting characters are one-dimensional and some performances are laughable. The fight scenes are amazing, the one where Li escapes from the prison and the last fight where they're surrounded by fire are highlights, also Li figured a way to get Aaliyah in a fight using her legs and arms to fight off a hostile female fighter because 'I can't hit a girl'. Overall delivers, but sometimes tries to hard. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
5,Aaliyah's Legacy,"Her stardom was soaring high and the highly talented Aaliyah made her first screen debut. Aaliyah's debut in ""Romeo Must Die"" will show, not her singing ability, but acting ability. Aside from selling millions of records, this movie and ""Queen of the Damned"" will be remembered for her participation alone. Her screen presence is electrifying and you won't be able to take your eyes off of her. Aaliyah's energy and enthusiasm made this movie worth while. The beautiful singer/actress definitely had 'IT'."
3,"Good, but not what he's fully capable of","Don't get me wrong, this movie blows ""Black Mask"" out of the universe, but it's still not what Jet's truly capable of putting out. The fight scenes are great (especially when he disarms a group of guys with wire ties as he goes along), but the use of wires here and there make it seem unrealistic. Jet, you're an awesome fighter and don't need to use wires, so lose them, ok?? Not as much flying around as in BM, but it's still there. Russell Wong makes an incredible villian, and his martial arts work is fluid and graceful. We definitely need to see him in something else soon! The plot is stretched reeeeeally thin, but it's still good. I'd suggest seeing it at least once, but I don't know that you'll go for repeated viewings. ""Fist of Legend"" is the best of the best of his, so get to that one too."
2,sleepy-time movie,"I can't really write a review here on the content of the movie, but if this say's anything for it... I tryed to watch it 3 times fell to sleep each time. it was just to boring for me. there were a few good fights but all and all it just put me to sleep."
2,Romeo Must Kiss Juliet,"Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out. Romeo must kiss Juliet. Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky. A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers."
2,what a bore..!!!,a movie made with the sole aim of taking u out of this world even if it's a silly tour.
4,Great movie to watch out for,"If there's a Romeo, there must be a Juliet, and this Oakland-set bone-crusher deals with two warring gang families (one African-American, one Chinese) whose straight-and-narrow offspring want no part of the inevitable mayhem. Martial arts star Li's English-language starring debut has toned down the brutality to fashion a movie of slightly broader appeal. OK but overelaborate and overlong. Directorial debut for renowned cinematographer Bartkowiak. Panavision."
3,marginal outing for jet li,"Jet Li is a great martial artist and a pretty darn good actor to boot, so his stuff is always at least pretty good. This one was disappointing, however. A couple of nice fight scenes, particularly the little sparring match on the roof with Russell Wong. But over all there isn't enough kung fu action for the martial arts afficionados and the story line is a little too tired for the non martial arts crowd. The Romeo and Juliet bit actually plays pretty well, but overall this one is merely okay. Jet Li has done better (for example, Fists of Legend). Let's hope his next outing is back up to par."
2,The Pits....,The much anticipated and hyped about movie came across as a damp squib... too much of confusion and no clear picture emerged as to what was happening in the movie. The action sequences are the only saving grace and not to metion the beautiful Aaliyah who put some glamor in the movie
1,Weak and Overrated,"This Movie does Jet Li no justice. Romeo Must Die tries so hard to dazzle the viewer with special effects that it forgets who its core audience is...Martial Arts Fans! The plot and screenplay are so predictable that you know who the traitor is from the very beginning. But the worst crime is the lack of serious Martial artistry from Jet Li. This movie needed less elements from the Matrix and more from Fist of Legend. Jet Li is all about Kung Fu mastery, Romeo Must Die is all about Matrix mockery."
2,More was expected,"I really expected more.. The fight scenes look a lot like puppets hanging with strings defying gravity and the laws of physics. I mean it was acceptable in the Matrix because the story line dictated it, but it's not so acceptable here though.The plot is weak and does not nail you to your seat as an action movie. You can easily go open the door for the pizza delivery without stopping it and continue watching the movie without missing a thing.In summary, if you had 2 options: 1) To watch this movie. Or 2) Go buy vegetables at the supermarket... I would choose option 2."
2,Romeo has died...........,"I just dont know what they was thinking in this one, I mean who is Romeo? what was his involvement with this movie? If I could rated this film for the fight scenes, it would be higher maybe. Jet Li is not the same Jet Li of Black Mask in this movie, now when co-star Aaliyah comes in the scenes a glow of lights lite up, then dim when absence."
5,magic flim,Jet Li was funny and hardcore at the same damn time doing his best the late great Aaliyah movie debut was flawless she was great a must see flim
5,Romeo Must Die,"Tough ex-cop Han Sing travels from Hong Kong to America to find justice for his brother, who was murdered in an ongoing battle between Chinese and African-American gangs. Han soon takes his brother's place in the war and becomes entangled in the violence, until he falls in love with Trish, the daughter of the rival gang's leader. Jet Li is in top form in this movie as he jumps, kicks, and flips with a quick and flawless grace of a dancer. Jet Li fight work and chemistry with costar Aaliyah makes this a very entertaining movie."
4,A different martial arts movie,"Han Sing is a former Hong Kong cop now living in Oakland. He shares an attraction to Trish, a mob bosses daughter. Even though they are from rival families, Han and Trish, become very close and try to uncover the truth behind the blood feud.This is a pretty good martial arts movie. As usual, Jet Li kicks everybody's butt. He's the only decent actor in this movie, and he's not that great. The intensity and compelling story keep you interested. Romeo Must Die is pretty good, but maybe not worth owning. I do think it's worth seeing once. So I recommend that you rent it. You may really enjoy it and decide to buy it later."
3,Movie can't be seen twice.,Lack of vision was evident & the movie was searching it'ds direction.It lacks proper direction.
2,This film does not live up to its hype!,"Romeo Must Die is a mildly entertaining film that just doesn't live up to its potential. Many of the reviews I have read compare it favorably to The Matrix, but this is ridiculous. Now, don't get me wrong...Jet Li is a phenomenal martial artist. Martial arts alone, however, do not make a great film. The acting was poor and the improbable fight sequences were downright silly, as they were physically impossible (at least in The Matrix, there is a logic that allows for gravity-defying flips, etc). Finally, the relationship between Han and Trish simply doesn't go far enough to warrant a ""Romeo & Juliet"" romantic link. They never even kiss for crying out loud! Overall, not a good film."
2,Boring Movie Good Music,"The movie draggs and has too many characters budding to be the center of attention. The story is weak can't we get past the racial**** and just be people? If you like KungFu action rent a different movie Jet Li seems more like a Gymnast and Ballet Dancer in this movie. Aaliyah, well looks hot but other than that...Oh yeah the Music is really good."
2,"To slow, To Stupid, and way to over the top!","After buying this DVD from Amazon and hearing some good reviews about the movie, I have to say I was slightly disapointed with the overall movie.First off the story gets far to confusing, the badies are not bad enought (playing n64 games at one point in the movie) and lastly the action sequences and few and far between and when they do come the are a let down, well over the top, A sort of kung fu matrix style action,I would have to tell anyone thinking of buying this to please save there money and If they are after an action movie get the matrix or the more recent release of chill factor"
2,I am not a big Jet Li fan...,"but I know what a good movie is. This is not one. Although it is tauted as ""From the producer of The MAtrix"" don't be fooled. The two have one simularity: Wall-walking. The comic-relief is horrible, and I was bored with the plot. ""Black Mask"" was much better."
4,action movie with a difference,with the come back of superstar Jet Li in yet another action packed movie which depicts a very traditional chinese family and its conflicts to a black business family . The war between these family's is mainly due to the control of the dockyard which is owened half by the blacks and half by the chinese . We can also see a emotional backing to it where Jet Li proves his love to his brother by finding his kileer's. So very much worth seeing movie
3,jet li at his best,jet li shows high class martial arts techniques.with its slick stunts it's a movie everyone should atleast watch once.
4,excellent,"It's a great story of romie & juliet. I thought the first half of the movie was interesting, and quite pick up until the second half. It's good to watch this movie."
4,Great Stuff,This movie is a great watch for all action lovers. Its after a long time that we get to see such a movie and it refreshes you with for the 120 mins you are in the theatre.
4,A must for Jackie Chan fans,A movie worth watching .With all great stunts by Jackie Chan one gets glued to it .
2,Very Americanized Jet Li,"Jet Li is as charismatic as ever, but the only other actor with any presence at all is Delroy Lindo. The story tries to mix in a football ownership angle which comes off as simply silly. Very innovative shots of the interior of a person's body as a devastating blow hits are neat, but serve no real purpose. Without Jet Li, this film wouldn't be worth anyone's time. ... ."
3,"It has something, I just don't know what. . .","I went to see this movie in the theaters and was not impressed with the storyline. The effects were good, but the plot was lacking. Also, Aaliyah and jet-li (our Romeo and Juliet) didn't really have great chemistry, I wasn't convinced that this was a tale of star crossed lovers. Basically, they seemed like two people thrown together who became good buddies and united in a common goal, except it never got that intense. Aaliyah is great to watch because she is stunningly beautiful and she does not do a BAD job for her first acting role. Jet Li is amazing to watch in action. The movie had bits of comedy. However, nothing came together to make a good story. The acting as a whole was semi-good at best, though you could tell the actors were trying to make it strong.I'm glad I went to see this in the theater for the fight scenes and the effects. But the movie itself isn't all that great."
3,Martial Arts goes Mainstream,"What othe reviews of this movie have failed to mention is it's popularity among people who are not normally martial arts fans. Most of this is due to the plot, there is one. The othe cause is that acting talents are called upon. The fact that they are not always delivered is inmaterial. The movie sets a fairly brisk pace and the fights are well staged and always plot driven. Not since Jackie Chan's First Strike has a martial arts movie been as well received in the US. I look forward to more of the same from Jet Li."
3,romeo juliet,if there is a romeo there must be a juliet.movie has a lot of action. the ployb could have been better
1,Dud,Jet's talents are not evident in this film. I believe that they are best displayed with little to no special effects. the 'Matrix' style effects used in this film were completely out of place. It also annoyed me that the film tried to be a showcase for aaliyah or whatever her name is. BIG LETDOWN.you want good jet li fights..... buy Fist of Legend. a bruce lee re-make that is very well done.
1,Great Action but Wack Movie,The Action in this Film was Tight but the Movie on a Whole ...&Was Very Cliche.Jet&Aaliyah never got a Proper Romantic Spin.The Action was this Films Only Saving grace.Avoid at all Costs.Jet is Badd.Aaliyah is a Cool Artist but making Films ain't the Ticket.Predictable&Boring.
3,Cool fight scenes,"Jet Li plays en ex-cop who went to prison in Hong Kong for crimes his father committed. The father and younger brother move to the U.S. and continue with their criminal enterprises. Their main competition comes from a black family headed by Delroy Lindo. When Li's brother is killed, he breaks out of prison and comes to the U.S. to find out who did it. He meets Delroy Lindo's daughter who is the only one in the family not involved in the family business. She helps Li investigate who killed his brother. Along the way, her brother also gets killed and their are people in both organizations who are not as loyal as their bosses believe.Romeo Must Die was an enjoyable movie. The story moves along at a decent pace and Jet Li and Aaliyah have good chemistry together. There were some excellent fights with imaginative use of items at hand. I especially liked a fight Li was having with a woman. Deciding he couldn't hit a woman, he used Aaliyah's body to throw the punches and kicks."
4,One Of The Better Martial-Arts Movies,"I was surprised I enjoyed much of this since martial arts movies are okay but nothing I really get into often. Jet Li plays the only likable character in this Asians vs. Blacks gang story.Some of the stunts were tremendous. Some were so over-the-top, so unbelievable that they were funny. The movie certainly isn't one to be taken seriously.The wild action scenes, fairly involving story and nice colors and interesting sound track all make this movie a cut above the normal martial arts fare. The excellent surround sound and sharp picture make it a good one for DVD."
2,Entertainment not at it's best,"Jet Li stars in this movie about a policeman of Hong Kong who went to jail for covering his Father crimes in order to get his brother safely in the U.S., but when that brother is killed, he escapes from prison, takes a plane and comes to find his brother's killer.The rest of the movie is a very dull detective film, with coincidences all around, but some good fights where you can almost see the cables. One good point, the killer of the brother was very unexpected."
3,Good; but miss-cast...,"This is one Jet Li movie I believe could've been better if Li was the villian and Russell Wong was the lead!Try as they will, Jet and Aaliyah did not have the chemistry to pull off a believable romance, not too mention, they didn't even look good together. Handsome Russell Wong, on the otherhand, could've easily pulled off a realistic romance with the beautiful Aaliyah.(RIP)"
3,certainly better than cradle 2 the grave but not as good as unleashed,"now certainly all the action kept me more entertained than unleashed did, but the long fight scenes were just better in unleashed. Overall I would givem the same rating, but unleashed gets the edge. For a movie that should have been cut by about 10 min, still entertaining. This certainly kicks the ass of the transpoter movies."
3,Romeo & Juliet,"Don't be fooled by this title I mean its is nothing what it seems.It's about Han(Jet Li) escaping from prison to search for his brother Death.While on the hunt he runs into Aaliyah(R.I.P)that plays trish and father of a Business man dad.Hans dad a mobster,faces off with trish family cus of misunderstanding of Which Russell Wong plays a big part of.This movie is not that bad,it just lacks alot of action just alot of running around but the matrix moves are really cool though."
4,Great Plot + Fantastic Action Sequences = Outstading Movie,"When I first saw trailers for this movie, I thought it was some hastily put together, no plot, American Martial Arts Movie. I was very surprised to see that the movie had 2 plots intertwined and took up most of the movie. You might say that the movie focused too much on the plot.The action sequences are fantastic, however, the X-Ray death sequences feel out of place at times. The movie is unexpected at times and is very entertaining.Also, the DVD is full of extras including Aaliyah's video for ""Try Again"", the movies top track that is very catchy. It can also remind you of your old elementary school teachers. I don't ever really feal like trying again after I fail.On a 1-10 scale, this movie is an 8. Wait, I forgot to include the great acting, 8.5"
3,"Text looks good, but can't open the examples in Panther <<< Clarification","The examples open fine in Tiger, but the project files aren't recognized in Panther.=================================================Page xxiv of the Preface:""Most of the examples will run properly on Jaguar and later versions.""Those are the examples that I could not open in Xcode 1.5 on Panther 10.3.9."
5,Excellent Book,"If all of the Apple frameworks were explained as well as CoreGraphics/Quartz is in this book, life would be so much better for independent programmers. I am not writing code in XCode, but one where I need to port calls to custom classes. This book has helped me so much. I have not located the link on the publisher's site (maybe I'm just missing it), but my only complaint (a very minor one) would be that they don't have a contact email for the authors to report errata or thank them.Well written, to the point, good code examples and does not duplicate the Apple documents. Covers Carbon and Cocoa calls. The chapters on axial and radial shadings were the most helpful for me."
2,No colors on the Kindle version,I bought the Kindle version of this book which was a mistake. The kindle version did not have colors and some of the diagrams or pictures do not come through. Diagrams are difficult/impossible to understand since all the different colors come as same shade of grey. The text also refers to things like 'Figure 3.4 on page 34' which is difficult to navigate because Kindle does not provide page numbers.I still want to buy programming books in ebook form so I can store them in my laptop. However lack of color makes Kindle not an option for reference books. I will be searcing for other ebook format alternatives.I would not recommend the Kindle version of this book.
5,great,"Haveread many of his books. The bondage breaker is bvery very good. Came in time, happy with it. Was a gift"
4,Let the Blood Flow,"These two brothers are just a couple of freaks. Alucard manages to put them to rest. As usual this is another fantastic volume of Hellsing. I've seen the entire series and have to say that the ending will be exciting. Although it seems like the series still needs more episodes to really feel finished.I own this one and I think that it's pretty good. However, there is a stupid filler episode thrown in to fill time. The filler episode is the reason I give this volume 4 stars instead of five. Why they do this I don't know except that the writers ran out of a good storyline for that particular episode. Look forward to the end being spectacular. Alucard is gonna let the blood flow."
4,Surprisingly Good,I was amazed by how interesting this series has become. The characters and the storyline are very interesting and the action scenes are pretty cool. The music score is also very well done and the dubbed voices compliment the film nicely. The whole series is worth your time and money.
2,Soft = Loud,What is up with this new Soft = Loud thing?Kind of dull...It's like Lillith Faire for men. ?I guess...They look mad cool though. All brown and like Greg Allman circa '72. Sweet brah...Well...you work hard all your life and then you have to do something...at least they're not killing anyone...Awesome.
5,"Beautiful, moving, amazing album!","I loved the first one by Vetiver but I just felt week in the knees listening to this one for the first one.The first track is a master piece, and the rest of the tracks are just perfect."
2,zzzzzz,"For old Vetiver fans this may be a miss. Stream the whole thing on their website before hand. I find most of the songs sound just like the one before and after it. There is no originality and where is Alissa's transending deep and erotic cello? Honestly, the CD made me fall asleep, unlike their past ones. This fan is passing up on this one, sorry. :("
2,Size,"This product was to small for the intended child. A one year old might haveBeen able to use it, provide they could sit that long!"
5,Advanced workout!,This is a great workout especially if you have done the Basics. This is a fast work out so if you like your work outs slow you may want to go for the more Basic rather than advance. That being said I really liked this exercise video and would recommend it. I own 3 tapes of advanced tae bo tapes and think this is one of the best.
1,Toxic Smell,"The smell was horrible. Had to leave foam pieces (NOT a mattress, a mattress ""substitute"" 3 pieces of foam with a mattress pad cover) in room with door closed and window open for weeks in subzero temperatures, before being usable. Febreeze helped some. Tearing eyes, running nose, raw throat whenever exposed. This can't be healthy.Also, you can definitely overheat.The most annoying on-going problem I have is the 3 pieces of foam do not stay together and are forever sliding off the bedframe."
3,Not quite what I enjoy,It seems that it took forever to get in to the story. I only read about 30% of the book and decided I needed something with a bit more substance.
2,Not that great.,"I did like the mystery that starts immediately on page one, but I hate mystery books. I might have gone on reading more than the 15 or so pages I read, but the author was too ""wordy""; (I lack a better term of words), so that bored me, & the boredom finally over~rode the curiosity factor so I gave up on this book. If you love a mystery & can slip past the ""wordiness"" of this story, then maybe this book is for you."
1,Repetitive and dull,"I purchased this book because of the good reviews, but was extremely disappointed in it. I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting. I felt absolutely no connection to them, and just didn't care what happened to any of them. I found the main character to be boring, and too much time was spent on repeating the same feelings or ideas over and over. I like a good mystery, but this just did not grab my interest. I forced myself to complete it, because I don't like to leave a book unfinished, but it was a struggle and, I feel, a waste of time. I definitely would not read this author again."
1,Romanticized suicide,"I liked the plot, the mystery, the vintage charm of this novel. However, for a mystery, the pieces didn't fit together very well, and it totally romanticizes, of all things, suicide!"
3,A good little 'who-dunnit',I had never heard of this author before and only considered it because the title appealed to me; then read the first chapter and decided to buy it.I really enjoyed reading it until the ending let me down slightly. It seemed to me that the ending happened all too quickly (maybe even too simply) after a great build up of twists and turns.But I still really enjoyed it!
5,Beyond expectation,The company I have dealt with in the past 13 years. Very reliable and will recommend to anyone. They have very nice deals.
1,"Don't waste your time, thin as toilet paper and the sizes run VERY small","I wear suits shirts and ties 5 days a week. I have over 50 dress shirts in my closet. I like to keep a plain white shirt at the office in case of emergency spills. I ordered this shirt not expecting much and I got even less. First the fabric is sooo thin, it's listed as a cotton blend but it's 55 poly 45 cotton...that sounds more like a poly blend to me. Next the fitment is horrible. I have an 18 inch neck but I often have to order a 18.5 or 19 to fit my 50 inch chest. I ordered a 19 on this shirt and it was SOOOO tight. The sleeves were short and if I decided the roll them for use with french cuffs the sleeve would END at my forearm. The shirt was made in China and clearly meant to fit a petite Chinese boy.Stay away from this shirt, go to a Van Husein outlet and your money will be better spent."
2,Keep the output current in your mind when you order this,"I bought one from the Eforcity. This convert's output current is marked as 550-650mA, NOT the 1A described on the Amazon."
2,Didn't do what I wanted,Did not work for on what I bough it for (car vacuum). But I did work on something else (car phone charger.
1,Low power use only! 300mA,"Well I'm pissed. I need much more current. Nowhere on the product page did the seller say it's limited to 300mA. I'd return it, but shipping is more than the price of the item."
2,"maybe for you, not for me.",This didn't work for me. Admittedly I did not think it was going to. The Adapter likely has a very small usable amperage range. I tried it for a portable DVD player and it failed completely. Seemed to work fine for a cell phone though.
1,AC/DC converter plug,I purchased this item to use with a tire pump which plugs into the 12volt outlet in a car. It does not work. I plug it into an outlet in my home and plug in the 12volt auto plug and nothing happens. In fact the light on the adapter plug goes out
4,like it,like it for the prices i got it. works and sometimes i need it.....I`m getting ready to order another one...
1,Adapter does not work,This AC to DC adapter does not work. I tried on different outlets and electrical items with the same results.I am planning to return it for a replacement that eventually should work.
1,Shame On Me,"Shame on Me for not reading the reviews of this item before purchasing.Shame on Amazon for allowing this seller to continue this scam.The adapter is worthless...won't even light up a 12v light bulb...the small 12V air compressor I bought FERGETTABOUTIT!The old adage ""You Get What You Pay"" for is true.ONE star is more than it deserves."
1,does not work waste of money,don't waste your money it does not work and it's a cheap piece of junk! I wish i could get my money back
1,Totally useless even for low power requirements,"The 12V wall plug power adapter is rated for 1.0A current in the item description, the label on the actual item states 0.550-0.650mA. Does not provide a stable power for a small piece of electronics without any moving parts, causing frequent on/off cycles, although measured output voltage matching the specs. In my opinion, this merchandise deserves a zero stars rating, but one star is the lowest available."
1,AC to DC Cigarette Lighter Adapter,Don't waste your time and money. I have tried two of these and they are horrible. I have a small air comprssor for my car. This adapter will barely run the flashlight and doesn't even have a prayer of running the compressor. It's worthless.
1,doesn't source sufficient current for my needs,"At Amazon's ""frequently purchased together"" suggestion I bought this to run the small emergency auto air pump I also purchased. However, the converter can't source enough current to power the pump. The converter only provides 350 mA. The converter might work fine for lower power uses, but you better check to be sure."
3,Unknown,"It didn't work for my radar, which is what i bought it for. It keeps saying low voltage. Anyway it seems like it works for everything else, it just didn't work for me."
2,giving some wierd sound,I have a eforcity car charger. I dont have USA plugSo I bought car charger to USA plug converter(SEM-AC/DC: AC Wall Plug to 12V DC Auto Plug Adapter (Purchased on 01/17/2010)) when i keep all this combinations its not working.
1,I really usuless.,"This article helped me not me for what I bought it. Does not work with an air compressor 12 volts, although it has to come together."
1,AC to Dc car cigarette lighter socket adapter eForceCity Universal AC to DC,Both my air inflater for car tires & car vaccum cleaner work on my car cigarette lighter socket butwon't work on this AC to DC car cigarette lighter socket adapter when plugged to the wall electric receptacle
1,untruthful deceiving advertising,This item was never described as 500 ma.. it inferred that it would run a 12 v air compressor ( as it appeared on the same page at the bottom ) as the compressors. I was displeased when I got it. But as it would cost more to send it back than its worth I have no choice but to keep it or throw it out. Some of the reviews say that it exploded when pluged in. I am heasatant to even plug it in. Poor advertising minimum truth = junk.
3,"Adapter didn't work for me, but the order and shipping was flawless","I took a chance ordering this adapter, but wasn't sure if it would work with laptop power charger that has a cigarette lighter plug. Sadly, it didn't. Maybe not the right kind of adapter."
1,Poor quality. Does not work,Does not work.this was reccomended to be purchased with 12 volt air pump. Same flimsy construction as other one ordered. This also does not work. Vendor is sending replacement. This is important to me to have this converter working. I am disappointed at the quality of this product.
1,It doesn't work.,It doesn't work. I plugged into the household current and then attached the cigarette lighter type plug into the DC outlet. It did'nt work so I threw it away. This is the first time I got gypped on E-Bay.
2,Does Not Work With All Devices,I purchased this unit so that I could charge my Magellan GPS at home. The GPS would not power up when plugged into this device. It did work with some other 12V devices.
2,Did not work,I am not sure why this product did not work for my auto-compressor but it would have been nice and was at a good price.
4,Light Wieght and Porable,"I use it to charge my cellular, though it would work for anything that uses a 12V DC Auto Plug as a ellectical sorce. It is light wieght and therefore comviente to take with you. It puts out 500mA as apposed to a heaver one I also have that is rated at 1.000 mA."
3,an ok product.,"this ac to dc socket will charge cell phones, etc. but don't expect it to run a compressor or anything that needs a lot of juice."
1,Product Didn't work at all,"I bought this so that I could plug in my air compressor which works from my car only at this point. While the green light does go on when its plugged into the wall, it does not transmit power to the air compressor, so it was a total bust getting this. Luckily it was cheap."
2,Less of what was expected,"The idea of the product is excellent, however it is not what was expected. It works , but it not universal for all chargers."
1,Doesn't work- NO stars,Paid 35 cents for the unit and approx $4.00 shipping (unknown until purchase complete) and it does not work. You get what you pay for and the rip off on shipping is getting uiversal. Note: I had to click on a star to get out of this review page.
1,This is not working!!!,"This is not working. This is not usefull now. This product is not a good one, please try to test at the time of sending to customer."
1,Wrong Voltage,"This product did not properly convert the AC Voltage from the wall socket into DC Voltage to power my device. The device was not able to turn on. The output voltage listed on the device did not match the output voltage listed by the vendor on their site. The vendor only suggested that I return the device. However, I would have to pay for shipping. Do not recommend this product."
1,Socket Review,These item did not work when trying it with a hand held 12 volt powered hand held vac. I had ordered 2 of them and niether of them worked. All that happened was that fuse in the vac plug burned out!!!!!!!! Not only that but the vac plug got stuck in the socket adapter and both were ruined trying to get apart!!!!!!!
2,Adapter,"Held together by a screw and a sticker. Literally, a sticker... i.e. a piece of tape.If you leave it in the car it will melt off.This product is not meant to last. It is cheap.But it does work... As long as the sticker lasts. :-)"
3,I needed so I got it,"I purchased this item as it was listed as ""frequently purchased with"" the item I wanted to buy. It was an accessory I needed so I got it. It does not work with the kilotons cooler/warmer I purchased."
2,Doesn't work,"I plugged this into AC supply and hooked up the car vacuum(that works on 12v dc) but it does not operate that way. Same way i checked my car compressor too. Result is same. I have two of these products, none is working for the above situation. I might be wrong, but this is what it is right now."
1,Does not work!,"I plugged in my Droid Revolution and the Red lights on the device dim and get bright, dim and get bright and the % of charge on the Droid does not improve. Also, the Droid does weird things by itself. Goes to different screens by itself???"
1,Not what it pretends to be,"The technical specs claim the output is 12 VDC and the label in the photos shows 12 VDC, 500 mA. The product I received is labeled 13.5 VDC, 550-650 mA. Neither of these specs are near the truth. The actual load/output values observed from testing the three units I purchased are:~ 5 ma 13.5 - 13.6 V100 mA 13.2 - 13.3 V200 mA 11.5 - 11.7 V300 mA 8.3 - 8.5 V400 mA 5.7 - 6.0 V500 mA 4.0 - 4.3 VSo they may or may not work for charging a cell phone with a car charger cord, but they are useless as general purpose 12 VDC adapters. I am unfortunately used to marketing people taking liberties with specifications, but this is ridiculous. A more truthful spec would be: Open circuit voltage 13.5 VDC, short circuit current 550-650 mA, UNREGULATED."
5,Great Service,"Thank you the Product is just as Describe and it works,I was able to use it right away reliable"
1,Opening Too Shallow,The opening for the cigarette lighter plug is too shallow. I've tried a few different plugs and none of them will insert far enough to stay inserted. The spring clips on the sides push them back out again.
1,Very Upset,We were heading out for an 8-day houseboat trip and needed this adapter for the DC air compressor we were bringing. IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!! Don't let the cheap price fool you. You get what you pay for. Luckily I tested it before we left and realized what a hunk a junk it is so I had to change plans and find an alternate solution.
2,Just OK,"I found this book a little boring, the informations are easy to find elsewhere for free and the recipes are unappealing and bland."
5,Good Men's Work / Dress shoes,I am very happy to buy this shoes.The Design is somewhat different from my other Lugz shoes.Suggest for your best comfort if you look for the new one always add 1/2 size bigger as the newer design are less wide as the old one.
3,I dunno,"I'm giving it three stars because I remember watching it all the way through but I can't remember a thing about the plot. I watched the movie in December, and if it had been memorable in any way, I'd recall at least SOMETHING about the movie."
5,One of the Best,"Set up first by origin then male alpha followed by female alpha for each section. Tells the stories of names that come with stories to tell instead of just glossing over and assuming you know them already. The only thing of any annoyance with this book is that you need the origin to find the name or else you waste time flipping through looking for it in every country. A list in the back or front of the names and origins (only) would be appreciated if this is reprinted. On the plus side? Of course it would be the joy upon finding the name with pronounciation, historic meaning, nicknames and alternate spellings as well as those wonderful stories."
2,More research please,"I googled this book thru Baby Names Wizard and searched under only 1 name, Kari and this book has inaccurate information. Kari is a Norwegian diminuitive of Katherine and was very popular in Norway from about 1930-1960. I have never heard of the Irish version and I am not even certain if the info is accurate. Looking up Kristin, it does not even list that this is the Scandinavian variation of Christina/e. These omissions cast doubt on the accuracy of her research. I would not buy the book, but actually do a thorough web search on the origins of a name.Origin of the name Kari:Transferred use of an Irish place-name, which is now in common use as a girl's given name. Alternatively, Kerry is an Anglicized form of the Gaelic Ciardha (black-haired one)."
2,not very deep research,"I haven't read all of this book, but from what I've seen, some of the name meanings are wrong. This author has only repeated general superstition about where the manes come from instead of doing proper research into the names, it looks to me that she has googled some names and put them into print. You can pick up similar books like this on market stalls for a pound, but buy it if you aren't really that bothered whether it's correct or not."
3,"Okay, but too many mistakes.","I really like this book, having bought two copies of it. (I lost the first.) But I have a lot of problems with it, too. First off, I speak German fluently, so I can tell that a lot of the names in that section she does not provide the correct pronunciation of. It has to make you wonder about the names in the other sections. Also, she cops out, often, saying only that a name is ""of uncertain etymology"", without even saying what it is thought (or even popularly held) to mean. Lastly, I tend to evaluate the comprehensiveness of baby name books by whether or not they have my name (Sabra). This one didn't!"
2,too many off the wall names,"if you are looking for an irish name spelled in gaelic, this is your book. if you are hard-up for a romanian name for your little one, this is your book. if you are looking for a ""normal,"" pronouceable name, you'd do better looking elsewhere.yes, this book has a billion names in it, but well over half are utterly unusable--seriously. either you cannot pronounce them (see above referenced gaelic names) or they are just plain off the charts weird.we have this book and while i flipped through it a few times, mostly we made fun of the names in it."
5,A Page Turner,"A compelling read about and by one of the leading lights of our time. Not only does Joanna Macey's journey inspire the reader, it is a reminds us that passion and curiosity is the fuel for greatness. This book covers an astonishing array of subjects, but in such a personal, warm way, one is drawn along as a friend into matters profound and current. A beautiful, accessible book!"
3,What makes George Soros tick,"In order to understand who George Soros is, you must learn about his father. How to beat the system; why all human undertakings have flaws and how to exploit them. George learned early and well and developed a contempt for order that led him to become the world most manipulative, cynical financial genius."
5,Quality folk that lives on today,"Bascom is more than just a folk singer, in a way he is a messiah and role model of how human kind should live. When I listen to his music, a certain tranquility enters my heart, a tranquility that floods my body and mind with a warm, fuzzy tingly feeling. I think this could be the key to world peace and further understanding to the universe. The only reason Bascom is not used for world peace is because of the ignorance of other people. People always say that they HATE folk music and will not give Bascom a try. If we can rip away this ignorance from people and EVERYONE listens to Bascom, it would be a step closer to a perfect utopia where we would not need law. It would be a perfect society, a society of love and peace and tranquility."
2,I'd Rather Lick a Frozen Flagpole,"Wow. This guy has a talent for cheese, saccharine, and making genuinely good subjects feel bloated with the author's own self-importance. Talk about the writer inserting his ego to detrimental effect! He packs his sentences with such a smug writerly sensibility that it's difficult to get into the story at all. Like, gag me with a spoon!That being said, where's the movie version? Didn't I see Willem Dafoe someplace recently...? That's gotta sting! (I mean, golly, don't studios usually play the 'me too' game? Maybe they could hook the author up! Dunh dunh dunh... 'NOSFERATU,' starring, as Murnau, RICK MORANIS! And, as Shreck, in his biggest role since Diff'rent Strokes, it's KAREEM ABDUL JABBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!)"
4,"Taming Fire, V of D",This is one of two books I needed to complete my Voyages of Discovery set...thanks to Amazon.This series is still great though the info ends in the late 90's. I especially like the comparisons of the ages at the end of each series. The stickers and varied-shape pages keep one's interest.
5,"Wow...the best, most easy desert ever...","I buy this product because I am gluten intolerant and have not found gluten-free ready made deserts that I will eat. I don't always have time to bake homemade BUT this brownie mix tastes like homemade and it's so moist and yummy! The rest of my family can eat regular brownies BUT they can't tell that these are gluten free. The only bad thing about these brownies, is they don't stick around long at my house. TRY them, you won't be sorry."
3,Not the best,These brownies had that 'off' taste that you sometimes get with GF baked goods. I prefer the Bob's Red Mill mix.
4,EXTREME chocolate flavor!,"I recently was diagnosed with Celiac, and tried these brownies. I LOVE THEM! They have a bit of a gritty texture as compared to regular brownies, and they are SUPER chocolatey. It is the most intense chocolate flavor I've ever had in a brownie. But I like that kind of thing, so I love 'em! Plus, they don't have a ton of fat and they have fewer calories than non-GF brownies, and because they are so chocolatey, they satisfy me quicker than what I remember with non-GF brownies. The ingredients are all organic too, which is nice.Highly recommended. :)"
5,There's only one problem.....,"And that is the weight I will gain from eating too many of these scrumptious brownies! I used the fudgiest brownie recipe with just oil and water, followed the directions to bake them for 18 minutes and got moist, chocolatey delicious brownies. This is my first Pamela's product...next I'm going to try the corn bread!"
5,truly multipurpose,This product is great for not only brownies but also cake. I used the recipe on the side for decadent cake and everyone loved it. People didn't know it was gluten/casein free at all. Was flavorful and moist. I ran out of vanilla almond milk so I used chocolate almond milk. It made it more chocolatey.For a gluten/casein free chocoholic it was a wonderful treat.
5,Amazing Brownies,"I have been off gluten for three months and although I am getting used to being deprived of my favorite desserts, it does not make it fun. Pamela's products are by far the best gluten free deserts around and the brownies are the best! Unlike other gluten free products that are dense and dry, these brownies are moist, light, and delicious. Even people who can have gluten will love this product."
2,"Gritty, grainy, sludgy","Everyone raves about Pamela's mixes, so I had high hopes. My kids seem to like them, so that's good. Perhaps if I had eaten them fresh from the oven I would have liked them more. I ate one the next day and found it to be the usual grainy, gritty texture I associate with gluten free products. After a few chews it was like a mouthful of mud. I will definitely be looking for something else."
2,Brownie mix -- Nothing to write home about,"I tried Pamela's Brownie Mix on the recommendation of a relative with celiac, about a year after I was diagnosed. I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes. Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey. My non-GF family & friends said they were ""weird"" and ""different"". Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another. I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them."
3,"not ""chocolatey"" enough for me","Not bad but I found it has more of a ""carob"" flavor than the rich chocolate taste of the Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie mix. I am a chocolate-lover and this product was a disappointment to my taste buds. I tried it because I love Pamela's baking mix. I went back to the Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - far superior taste and texture."
1,"Odd taste, odd texture, not worth it.","The store was out of the usual GF brownie mix we use (Namaste brand), so I bought these instead. That was a mistake. These brownies taste like chocolate is missing from the recipe, have a very odd aftertaste, and a really grainy texture.They smelled delicious so I was really hopeful but they are quite nasty. One of the previous reviewers said it tastes ""grainy"" and that is the perfect word to use. Not even my 3 year old chocoholic would touch these after one bite! I will not be making the mistake of buying these again.However, as a better alternative to those looking for a good mix, I highly recommend the Namaste brand brownie mix, I think they are even better than brownies with gluten!"
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy,"Okay, when you try to go gluten or wheat free there are many things that you miss. A nice fresh loaf of bread happens to be number one, but a close second is a wonderful pan of moist brownies. The sad thing is that many gluten-free mixes end up with products that are coarse and dry...and, believe me, I've tried many.This one, however, is fabulous. You'd never know it was gluten free. In fact, if you make it for people who aren't going gluten free, they'll never know. But why do that? They can have their regular old brownies and you can have these...all for yourself.Easy to make. Moist. Nice texture. They don't even need frosting. Just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top if you like (if you sprinkle it through a doily it will make a pattern for fancy events). I've also added nuts to this mix, such as almonds, walnuts, and even brazil nuts.Simply heaven."
3,Not a bad edition,"There are much better editions out there, I should have known that when I purchased it. The binding is extremely tight and difficult to use at the keyboard."
3,"The Hardcover is wonderful, but the printing is not good","I was stunned at the quality of its cloth cover. But the inside dissapointed me quite a bit. The Ink used to print this book is not uniformily applied throughout the book, so there are places where the ink is black and some others gray."
5,The song has great lyrics and the beat is highly contagious.,"This CD is a must have for all fans of pop music mixed with light rap. I love this CD and I have it. Five is a great new band that has broken through the charts and landed at number 12 and may have a chance at going into the top ten, possibly even the top FIVE. hehehehe. You should really buy this CD, it's a whole bunch of fun to listen to and it's easy to memorize. The song's beat gets branded into your head and is so rythmic you'll be addicted to the song. Listening to the song once or twice a day isn't enough. You'll play it with your head-phones on at night, on the bus, even at work!"
4,Hip Hop Be BACK !!!!!!!!,This album is one of the best hip hop/drum 'n' bass/jungle/rap/funk/jazz/big beat albums ive ever heard. It spans from early eighties hip hop to the late ninties jungle drum and bass very well. It even has hints at s'express and cheesy hip hop but it does it well. It has top MC's like tenor fly and navigator who give wicked performances. Every tune is a wicked tune and never bores unlike this review. Buy it if you like big beat and hip hop. Dont buy this if you like coal chamber........ ok?
1,"Actually, a great deception...","Revising now after 1+ year, actually this item works excellently only through the first 5 or 6 charges. Then it begins a steep curve down related to longevity; and now, it doesn't even starts to charge at all..."
5,"""Extraordinary Chester"" an ""Extraordinary"" book",Chester is a funny guy who learns a very important lesson in this wonderfully written and illustrated book. A must to give to your kids!
3,I heard this author being interviewed and read the book,"I heard David Hariton say that you can eat anything you want and lose weight as long as you exercise on a Los Angeles radio show last night. The author was very well spoken and made some good points but this did not make sense. The host, a Doctor, gave many reasons why Hariton's statements were not true, which I agree with. I was more impressed with the host and his other guests, especially Dr. Glickman, the author of one of my favorite books, Optimal Thinking-How To Be Your Best Self. They discussed the reasons for self-sabotage and gave practical solutions whereas David Hariton seemed like a salesman. A friend of mine had his book and gave it to me this morning. I agree with the author about the body having a thermostat but I knew that before he came into my life space. If you want to be convinced about this, this book will have some value."
2,This may work for the most part but...,I do think you will need to watch what you eat at least for health reasons. Another problem here is it seems like the same people wrote all these glorious reviews. I don't think the reviews by all these first time posters or readers are genuine. Just exercise vigorously for 30-40 minutes everyday without buying a book and see what happens.
5,One of those books that sticks with you long after you've finished it...,"I first read this book over about 20 years ago. Since then I've read and re-read it so much that I had to buy several copies because I wore the old ones out.It is a thought provoking tale that touches your soul and honestly makes you appreciate life just a little more than before you read it.Be warned, though, it is not your typical Pike book. If you're a fan of the teenage thrillers he's so famous for, this book doesn't even come close to that genre. If you're a fan of The Shack, than this book may enlighten you. That is not to say that this is a ""Christian"" story but more of a philisophical fable that weaves a little mysticism, a little religion and a whole lot of spirituality all into one.This book always picks me up and I honestly love it more each time I read it. I highly recommend it if you have an open mind towards creation and spiritualism."
1,Should have left this one alone,"My dislike for this book stems more from my personal views and expectations than the author's writing style.I was hoping this book would be something like The Immortal (my favourite Pike book ever since I read it 18 years ago), but was truly dissappointed when it turned out to have a feel similar to one of those hateful self-esteem-fix-up religious books that pops up everywhere like mushrooms these days. That's probably because this book is written in the first person narrative.Loads of people, however, seemed to have enjoyed it - if the Amazon rating is anything to go by. Yet, I can honestly say that I utterly disliked it.If you are in any way a spiritual person this book will appeal to you, but otherwise, just skip it."
5,Pure Awesomeness !!,"Love the name ""Sati""and love the story ;))) xoIt's a touching story that warms the heart and also full of suspense. Gave it to my daughters to read afterwards and its now making rounds at their high school !! Well done..."
1,"CPike, what were you thinking?","i had previously read pike's ""The Visior"" and ""The Last Vampire"" and i'm a hardcore pike fan (as well as stephen king), and this book is lacking everything that makes a good pike book. a usual pike book is about a teenage girl who goes on some quest over a murder and meets and falls for another guy and somebody probably dies in between too (if u've never read pike before, u won't know what i'm talking about). but this book was lacking everything. another thing i noticed was the main charachter was an mature male adult, which set the book with a very BORING storyline. the font is small compared to pike's others, so i just want to get the book over with and finish it, and move onto some of pike's more quality titles such as 'the last vampire' and the 'final friends trilogy'."
5,Sati is an ispirational novel!,I was scepticle at first to even read a novel by Christopher Pike becasue he is known young adult hooror stories. But my friend got me to read this and I loved it! It really makes you think about life and all the good things it has to offer. I read this book once a year now. It is one of my favorites. I encourage everyone to read this book one time intheir life.
5,Just a girl...,"She is who she is and she is there to be happy. What could be wrong with that? Along the way she happens to spread her peace and love to others, maybe awakening their souls, which, although have been sleeping for so long, are still tired and worn. Don't read this book if you are not prepared to look within and awaken."
4,If God was a girl.,"A trucker meets a young woman in the desert. She claims to be God, and fascinates everyone she meets, changing their lives in ways they aren't always aware of.Enlightening and not too preachy, this is a well-handled and convincingly realised story about an obviously heavy topic. And hey, what could be wrong with a book that suggests that silence and cookies point the way to heaven?"
4,very good,"I really liked this book. It was interesting...and all. But I thought that the ending wasn't too good. It was fine and all, but not my favorite. Pike did good in the book."
3,Good book,"What if God were one of us? It has happened before. If you read the bible, then you know. And no, I am not talking about Jesus. Anywho, I really liked this book. I adored Sati. She was a bit strange but she did what she came to do.I admit that some things that she did where not all god like. There were some parts that had me raising my eyebrows. I really enjoyed the plot though. Sati came into other peoples life's and completely changed them.They has no idea what she did to them until she was gone.The characters were all unique. The each had their own problems and had Sati helped them. Some lost their life's while others gained a new perspective.Overall, this book is good, fast read but nothing that I read again. There was some cursing."
3,The funny little things you notice,If you have read this book you must have read 'the last vampire' notice the character names SITA SATI how bazzar if you want someone to talk to about Chris E-MAIL ME NOW
1,TERRIBLE,"This book sucked, plain and simple. I tried to read it years ago, but could not continue the torture so I put it down. I tried again 5 years later and found it even more boring. Christopher Pike is not a spiritual writer. He should stick to the teen mysteries."
5,A wonderful surprise,"I was skeptical at first, for this book is unlike anything that Pike has ever written. This piece of work inspires the soul and broadens the mind of the unsuspecting reader. Most who read this will find something truly worth believing in: themselves."
2,Edwardian drivel,"I will concede two things to this novel: The author had me fooled and despite a terrible opening, I wanted to know what happened, but this book doesn't know what it is: not quite a Victorian gothic romance, nor a geopolitical thriller, it was hardly at all informative on the historic events leading up to the Great War, and the baronet was essentially wooden, as if that was enough to fool the English and Germans around him that he was one man or the other. I do not mind reading for light entertainment, but there were too many highly improbable threads, not enough plot, nor full fledged characters facing real moral conflicts. It is worse than modern pulp fiction."
4,Nice,A quality item shipped fast my only con would be the size. I was looking for a smaller lure and these were standard size.
1,Terror on the Titanic,I bought this book for my daughter and as we began reading and choosing our own adventures we realized the pages don't match the choices. Maybe ours is a misprint copy. We're going to return it for something else.
4,Good introductory tape on the Titanic,"The tape is good at introducing the Titanic story, posing questions, and then answering them using a mix of film footage, still photos, and computer animations to illustrate the narration. Much of the film footage is of ships other than either Titanic or her sister Olympic so some of the intended effect is lost. The information is broad is scope, from conceptual idea to finding the wreck, and presented in a clear and concise manner. It is hardly definitive, but does provide a good starting point for further reading. END"
2,Not very good,"This book was terrible! Choose your own adventure books are hard to keep up with where the choces are. It's better to read a book with a set plot. Also, it has hardly anything on everyday life on the ship. It's okay if you like Choose your own adventures, though"
2,"Some good stuff here and there, but mostly jazzed up and ""up to date""","GOD WITH US is for the most part a feeble attempt by CCM's most talented musicians to bring timeless Christmas carols ""up to date."" Most of these are simply jazzed up with fast notes and stylized tunes, while the performing musicians almost immediately forget that these songs were already masterpieces and had no need for improvement. You might as well take a work of DaVinci or Rembrandt and apply some magic markers to it to bring it more up to date and acceptable for today's audiences.The redeeming songs which earned this CD two stars from me instead of one included the ever-melodic ""Sweet Little Jesus Boy"" by Chris Willis and the breath of fresh air by Sandi Patty, ""Child of Peace,"" which features Bach's ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring.""Although I've always been a huge fan of contemporary Christian music, I will be staying away from most CCM Christmas albums in the future."
5,Excellent CD,"It was stolen with our CD player, and I had to find it again, as it is one of our Christmas favorites."
5,Travels of William Bartram: Naturalist Edition,"This is the best reprint of ""Travels"" and includes informative commentary and a huge annotated index useful for additional research."
4,A look at a part of the United States when everything was new and wonderful.,"William Bartram traveled the southeast, discovering and documenting new plant species and describing everything he saw on his travels. It puts the reader back in time when very little white settlement had yet occurred."
2,"An important, but not enthralling, book","William Bartram was a far better botanist than a writer. This book was a great achievement in that it was really the first work of American nature writing, and Bartram made a lot of great botanical discoveries during his journeys through the American Southeast. But his language is excruciatingly tedious. He uses ten pages to express what probably could be said in a single paragraph, and he often will offer two choices or options, when one would suffice: ""We encamped on a high cliff or bluff..."" And although he makes some interesting observations about the Cherokees, Creeks, and Seminoles, his views are often distressingly unenlightened or idealized. Although I love nature writing, and although I love the works of Thoreau, who came just a half-century later, I found Bartram's book painful to get through."
5,Thrilling!,"This one was just plain awesome! Just when you think you understand everything, Pratchett throws a curveball! Really kept me engrossed!"
5,Think Elves are nice?,"Most people do. They remember them for their beauty, grace, and magic. Which they do have. However this is all a matter of perception. The power of the elves lies in them making you think that they are better than you will ever be. They have Class. They have Style. And you are animals. The truth is elves are unbeliveably cruel. The only reason why they dont kill things right away is because it is so much fun to tourture them. They are cruel. They are selfish. They take and take and give nothing back except their merry laughter at how pathetic you are. But all people remember is their beauty. Granny Weatherwax is smarter than most though. She knows elves for what they are and would rather die than see them take over her town. Buy the book to see how the story turns out. I give it 5 stars :)."
3,Winner of the Not-Quite-As-Good-As-His-Other-Books-Award,"Let me start out by saying that I read Pratchett's books for two reasons. The first is that they are FUNNY. The second is that I enjoy the way he presents a twisted, cynical view of our world through the Discworld's crazy characters. Bearing that in mind, I can't agree with the other reviews of this book here... Lords & Ladies just isn't that great. It is well-written and has a decent plot, but I have read every one of Pratchett's Discworld novels, and this is the most disappointing one (with the exception of the slender Eric). I think Pratchett is suffering from the same ""disease"" that Douglas Adams caught... once the reader expects the unexpected, then it is no longer funny. If you've never read Pratchett, start at the beginning, with The Colour of Magic. Mort and Sourcery are good as well. When I shell out my 5 bucks for a Pratchett novel, I expect to laugh out loud while I read it. This time I didn't"
4,Good...but below Pratchett standards,"Compared with any book from any other author, this book is excellent.Compared with Pratchetts other books, it's quite mediocre.It's funny, and has some excellent moments, but in the middle it gets quite confusing. Furthermore, there are nearly no serious themes treated in this book, which is a shame because discussing serious themes is what Pratchett masters best. The only thing that makes me rate this book with 4 stars is the excellent character of Casanunda, the best of the book. Without him, I would have rated it 3, because it's worse than most other Discworld novels, but still better than most other things written by most other authors."
4,i needed this,"I found this book to be very amusing. Quite a change from the ordinary end of the world type Sci-Fi. Very light hearted and with an interesting plot line. I plan to buy the rest of the books in this series and enjoy them as well. Thank you Mr. Prachett, I needed a good laugh."
5,The best adventure of the three witches.,"Granny Weatherwax has to stop the elves, with Nanny Ogg and Margrat Garlic is the queen to be. So they set off on their greatest adventure yet. Digby York"
5,The summit of his career,"This is the summit of Pratchett's Work, as I see it. His books since have been going a bit on empty steam, and before this he was not stylistically complete. This has a great story, characterisation, and humour. It took until the third or fourth reading to get the more subtle jokes, yet it is also a masterpiece of immediate humour. Multiple-levelled and stylistically perfect."
3,"Funny at times, but heavy-handed","This is my first Pratchett book, and, judging from the book and some of the other reviews, perhaps that wasn't such a good choice. If one likes Tolkien, the Wizard of Oz, Hitchiker's Guide (which I don't like _that_ much), and Monty Python (really not my favorite) then Lords and Ladies could be good. It pokes fun at these other imaginary worlds, and does get you thinking about witches, magic, and even feminism in history. Very slow start, though -- no action for the first 140 pages or so. I almost gave up. Then it got exciting, albeit with drama at the level of a BBC comedy series. Satirical, but the narration, though implicit, is just too heavy-handed. If I try Pratchett again, I'll choose more carefully."
5,Compelling with great drama...,"This suspenseful story of three surgeons captured my interest from the first page. These three men that held lives in their hands, not only of their patients, also were threatened in their own livelyhood.Dr. Carrington whose uncompromising work ethic drives away the woman he loves; Dr. Savage, brilliant GYN doctor with the morals of a ""savage"" alley cat and Dr. Merrick, Chief of Surgery, has a do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do behavior problem.The story blends the secret lives of these three men into an intriguing drama of love, lust and revenge. Written in the '70's and still a dramatic presentation."
3,An okay book,"It is a good book for introducing someone to Mysticism in the Christian tradition. It is pleasant and easy to read.Other good takes on Christian mysticism include the works of Father Thomas Keating and Brother David Steindl-Rast, to name a few. I prefer their up to date teachings compared with what is in Jager's book."
5,The Case for Capitalism,"This book is 30 years old, but it presents an enduring case for the free market. An important point made in this book is that when any person starts a business in a relatively free market, the first thing he has to be concerned with is what OTHER people want, need and desire. In other words, free market capitalism actually FORCES entrepreneurs to first consider the others."
5,"Fantastic, Fascinating Read","This book speaks to the heart and soul of the conserative movement. A very engrossing, interesting, thoughtful read which speaks to the wider concepts of the economics and sociology of wealth creation."
5,A Very good perspective to human elements of economics,"This book carries in it the spirit of the economic and capitalist process. Capitalism is not solely about greed and profitability. It is about Humans realising their dreams, and living their lives.If business and economics were empirical science then all the big degree holders should be in the top echolons of human achievement and they are not.It is easy to use averages, against this book. But averages are averages and as George puts it best , we are born againat astronomical odds, in the bilogical process of selection. It is nothing compared to the odds we face in life. As George puts it , It is CHANCE, FAITH, RISK, UNCERTAINITY, INTUTION, ANIMAL INSTINCT all which are responsible for the progress of humanity and wealth creation."
2,Avoid,"I recommend that you skip this book despite what you may have heard about it. Those who consider it the ""supply-side bible"" are people who have only read this book and nothing else on economics. While Gilder does make some good points throughout, you are much better off reading Jude Wanniski's_THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS_ (a new edition was just released) and Robert Bartley's_THE SEVEN FAT YEARS_. I have nothing against Gilder, but this book has been overrated."
3,Is it economics and morals? (Pat Padley's review),"Even though I have had to read this book for an Economic class, I actually got something out of it. From what I understand this has become an aditional way of learning about supply side economics, which is still very confusing. I have also read many of the other reviews and I agree that this could very well become a bible for Reaganomics. I guess the one question I would ask is if George Gilder also took an Adam Smith view to some things. It seemed like he kept focusing on the individual view point of things. The way he proposed ideas is that it sounded like he wanted us to look over not just the mathematics, but the whole human spectrum. This includes faith, history, technology, etc.This book actually suprised me. I really didn't think I would enjoy it at all. Even though I was forced to read it for Econ, I'm glad I got to read this book. Gilder's as if moral views kept me interested."
5,Have built 2,"Great for the beginner in go cart construction. After completing the first one I build a second one> however, it was way more the 100.00"
2,Not really worth it.,"This book isn't too bad overall, but don't go getting any silly ideas like you are going to be able to build this thing for anything like a hundred pounds (about a hundred and fifty US dollars), because it isn't going to happen. You need access to a lathe and a welder, as well as drills and other tools, which you are assumed to already own. The amount of money you would end up spending on it, you would be better off buying a second hand one, as I doubt you will learn much from this book that you didn't already know. So overall, I'm not sure if it's worth bothering with, especially when the author's other book : ""Build you own sports car for as little as 250 and race it"" is available. That's a much better choice in my opinion- it really teaches you a thing or two."
2,Sequel Madness,"If you have ever gone to see the sequel of your favorite move only to be horribly disappointed, then you know how I felt after reading this book. It really is not in the same league as the author's previous excellent work. ""Build Your Own Sports Car"" is a classic and well written, but this book is really just a piece of fluff. The product you would get if you completed the project is merely a child's toy, and the instructions are poor. Skip it and buy the original book... you'll be happy you did."
5,"Great old usable textbook, great for techniques and wide coverage",This is actually a great old textbook to have. Advanced Algebra means college algebra and plus some. This covers everything from basic algebra to probability to theory of equations and some combinatorics.It has a ton of exercies and alot of great techniques for factoring and finding roots. The older textbooks are great for finding pre-calculator techniques and this is a treasure of them.It is worth picking up if you can find it cheap.
5,A MUST!,"Great stories. Few writers would dare to rewrite Salinger's ""Just Before the War with the Eskimos"" in a white trash landscape and Roth's ""The Conversion of the Jews"" in a catholic school. But Shepard did it. And landed on his feet. Amazing! Read this and follow with the novel ""Nosferatu"" (a fragment included here). ""Batting Against Castro"" is all that a short-stories collection should be: a kaleidoscope vision of the world as we don't know it and, also, an intimate invitation to visit a writer's mind. A rare privilege.R.S.V.P. NOW!"
5,Pretty amazing stuff here...,"If you're as sick as I am of cookie-cutter, writer's program writing, you should check out this fine collection of stories. Divided into two sections, ""Strangers"" and ""Family,"" it manages to avoid every cliche going in contemporary American fiction. Shepard goes straight into the character, and if you don't like it, that's your problem. Quick example: ""Who We Are, What We're Doing,"" in which you get a speed rap from a gung-ho flyboy who totally digs killing other people from his over-teched fighter plane. For three pages, you're there, like it or not. That's ""Strangers"" for you, but the ""Family"" is no less hard-edged. I usually burn out on a book of short stories after a couple, and lay it down to come back to later. Not with ""Batting Against Castro."" Shepard's a winner.-- Ed Ward"
1,A review?,"Why are people ""reviewing"" this since it hasn't been released? Yeah, we know you're dissapointed, we all are. But honestly, why does Amazon even have this up for reviews considering you can't buy it?And yes, I get the irony of me writing this as a ""review""."
5,victory,"This is a true story of victory & the fight to survive emotionally! Mr. Dawson successfully expressed in the book ""That Which Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger"" the pain, anticipation and the disappointment he was facing on a daily basis. My Heart was weak and all I wanted to do was reach out and grab this boy and let him know people do Love him.... but then I realized he's an adult now and had over powered the temptations of the ways of the street life - drug dealing, hustling, etc and he become a successful, inspirational role model for other foster kids going through similar circumstances and are looking for an answer or a way out."
3,"Not the product on the description, but Amazon made it good!","I ordered a meat grinder from Amazon. I was going to attach it to the countertop. When I received it, it was a model that wasn't able to handle a clamp, so I sent an email to Amazon. I told them that the product they sent me was not the product in the description which as a clamp-on type.After checking it out, the CS rep called me and expressed that there was, indeed, a discrepancy. she gave me several options including sending it back and getting a refund, but I opted for an amount refunded which would pay for hardware and board I needed to buy to make it a clamp-on.I was impressed and totally satisfied with the result. I have had nothing but positive results with everything I order from Amazon and can recommend them without hesitation.I rated the product at 3 stars, but I rate the personal service at a ""10!"""
3,Worked ok but leaks quite a bit from the handle,I bought this to make cranberry relish and I liked the way it processed the cranberries but it leaked quite a bit from the handle. I ended up using the food processor which made the relish a little too fine. I have not used it to make sausage.
3,Social-Commentary Science Fiction,"I own thousands of books now but this one was my first purchase. I recently revisited the book and was surprised to find a story that had survived the years quite well. As in much of 70s science fiction, this work focuses on social issues under a veneer of space opera.The protagonist is a member of a subjugated race that bears patiently the burdens of prejudice and intolerance. Fortunately he finds an enlightened soul who looks past common prejudice and gives our hero the chance to break free. Predictably we learn that this oppressed race has an intellect to match their brute strength. Unfortunately the author forgets to pay as much attention to the plot as to the message.Despite the overt and preachy tone of the story the science fiction is actually pretty good. Nothing that is going to challenge the likes of Dune--but enough to warrant seeking out others of Mr. Morressy's works."
3,A tough call for some great music,"Musically I am a big fan of this cd, but my main complaint would have to be that when listened to in headphones the instruments are not spaced well so overall, the cd comes off as sounding a bit ""small"".I do love the music though. The female who sings on a couple of the tracks is the main focus of my fascination with this cd. This is the only Thai cd I own (so far! ), so I'm not an expert, but the female vocalist has what I could only describe as a ""backwards"" style of singing. I don't mean ""backwards"" as a cultural slur. I mean that sometimes her voice sounds like she is singing in reverse, and it is mesmerizing.Actually I am torn. My first instinct was four stars, but I have decided on three, but I give it three stars with the disclaimer that I am a big fan of this cd and me and my music collection are better for owning it. So far I have only reviewed one cd that I gave two stars to, but this cd is head-and-shoulders more worth the money than that one is."
3,GREAT 4 HISTORY OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENT LOVERS,If you are interested in the history of musical instruments this is a good book for you! I personally didn't like the book topic but I did enjoy the structure of the book and all the flaps and moving parts. The stickers that you can reuse are a lot of fun and the mini book inside the book is cool! If you would like to learn more about the history of musical instruments you should read this book.
3,GREAT 4 HISTORY OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENT LOVERS,"Musical Instruments is about the history of musical instruments. It is a good book for people who would like to learn more about the history of musical instruments. I, personally didn't like this book that much because I am not into history of musical instruments, however, I did enjoy the flaps throughout the book. If you would like to learn more about the history of musical instruments you should read this book."
5,Namu Dai Bosa - Zen to America...,"Namu Dai Bosa is a book like any other. Words on paper. The book could be taken as a simple history. Names, dates, arrivals and departures. However, this book actually captures the souls of some of the real Zen pioneers. I must say, the first time I read the book, it had a strong effect on me. I think I am on my 7th or 8th reading. Like any good Zen book, it reveals more with each reading.The book is a touchstone to those of us who live in the west and have embraced Zen. I was made aware of this volume by my teacher, Roshi, Lou Mitsunen Nordstrom. Mitsunen actually edited the book back when he was a monk at Dai Bosatsu. (The stories he has told that didn't get in the book.)As of this writing, Namu Dai Bosa is still available direct from Dai Bosatsu Monastery. However you choose to obtain a copy, be sure to treasure it but be sure to share it with others.Paul Enmei Jizo Cummins, Zen MonkKuge-In TempleBrevard Zen Center"
4,"love, love, love this workout!","I had actually taped a portion of this workout 2 years ago from cable t.v. I taped it on a vhs and realized that if I didn't find a dvd, eventually the tape would wear out! It's a good workout...burns calories. But I also just love the instructor (not too cutesy & annoyingly peppy!) and the kick-box workout gives a sense of strength, power & confidence. I love that she has moves that work your abs (core) while doing the standing workout...something besides crunches. I don't really do the part with the bar. I'm thinking I should buy another copy just in case something happens to this one! I either take it on vacation, or some of the moves & routines I can do from memory...basically, a good workout that you don't need any weights or equipment for."
3,white irredescent beads,"the packaging was a little flimsy and the beads fall off the suspension bar too easily, but my niece loved it for her bedroom and all her friends thought it was very pretty."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this deodorant at a health food store and loved the smell of it. I was really excited about it....only to be completely disappointed. I have had to apply it several times per day, so much that the bottle is almost empty and I have only had it for 3 weeks! At $23, this is too pricey to perform so poorly. I did give it one star because it does smell really good. That would be the only thing it actually does....smell good. But when you start to sweat, it does not smell good, it's like you don't have any deodorant on at all. This product does NOT work. Do not waste your hard earned money. Off to continue my search for a chemical free deodorant...next I will try one by living libations."
2,Peppery smell,"I love Dr. Hauschka, and I'd rather not deal with the consequences linked to aluminum antiperspirants. So I decided to give this a try...1. The texture is creamy but dries quickly. No complaints there.2. It actually seems to work pretty well considering it has no antiperspirant ingredients. I was pretty impressed on this front, actually.So what's the problem? (Besides the high price, that is.)3. THE SMELL, to me, is basically intolerable. It's not floral at all, more like pepper. And I bought it directly from Dr. Hauscka's website so I don't think it's a problem of getting an old product. Even my mom, not one to hate on hippie scents, found it nauseating.I wanted to like this product, but the smell is a deal-breaker. :("
2,Overpriced. Should work better.,"This product works better than some, but still I find I that after using it in the morning, by the time I go to bed, it is necessary to wash the underarm area before putting on clean pajamas at night. It is way way over priced. Should cost in the neighborhood of $5.00 instead of $22 + . Won't be buying it again."
4,Pretty good!,"This is a pretty tiny breeders box (check the dimensions), but it's pretty well made and detailed. There is a bottom slat where the fry can swim or fall to the bottom of the box and there's a divider so you can divide the box into two parts for two fish.The idea is that you put the pregnant fish on to the top compartment. They give birth to live young (the fry), who then fall to the bottom. The divider is in case you have two pregnant fish. There are slats on the sides for water flow, and there's even a lid so fish won't jump in or out. The whole box just sticks to the side of the tank inside by surface tension.Right now, I'm just using it to keep fry in and so far it works pretty well. It's small for any kind of fish, even small guppies, but for fry it's ok. I'm satisfied with it so far."
4,Breeder box works well,"Good product, exactly what I ordered. The description doesn't provide as much info as I would have liked, but it was only a few bucks so I bought it and it works well. This would not be suitable for fish that lay smaller egg (i.e. zebra danios). The only issue I have has is the top popping off, which I fixed with a piece of tape. I used a wire to support it on the side of the tank. It hangs right on the side. I have already deliver a batch of fry."
3,3 out of 5 fish survived,We lost 2 fish that got sucked out by bigger fish through the openings in the side unfortunately. Its a bit of a pain to clean when you have fish in there but I don't think you can get around that.
3,It's ok.,"This floating box is ok. the v shaped piece allows fry to drop down without incident, and the slits on the side are fairly small. some of your smaller newborn fry will get out though, but it contained most of mine. it does seem to make the tank a lot more crowded though, because it sits in the tank. I prefer the hang-on-tank style, where you use an air line to pump water in and the water trickles back into the main tank."
1,The Mystery Cap,"Wow! This is the coolest yamaka I never ordered. I would have liked it better if it would have covered the tops of the ears, but it doesn't. This is actually more akin to a sailors cap. Returned...."
4,Arsonist and a depressed Great Dane,"Solid little thriller with a great sidekick named Spot. The main character Owen has to try and stop an arsonist, who seems to be targetting him and the people he cares about. That is in essence the story with the added bonus of infos and details on search and rescue dogs, arsonists and serial killers. One of the facts I found most interesting was the way the search animal reacts to live or dead finds, and the way it needs to be restimulated out of it's depression depending on the outcome. The book also delved into the pathology of arsonists and serial killers, including the some of the criteria a profiler works with. The book was a good read, however I felt it was a bit winded in places and spent too much time on plot inconsequential storylines, for instance the wounded mountain lion. I received a free copy of this book for my review."
5,ONE OF THE BEST NEW AUTHORS TO READ!,"AN ABSORBING MYSTERY THRILLER SET IN WONDERFUL LAKE TAHOE THAT OFFERS PENETRATING CHARACTERS ALONG WITH COLORFUL, NONSTOP ACTION. READERS WILL WANT MORE!PLEASE KEEP WRITING, MR. BORG!!"
5,Keep your dog close for protection as you read this one!,"Owen McKenna retired early from the San Francisco police form and is now working as a private detective in Lake Tahoe. This case, however, is personal. An arsonist sets a fire that threatens his home, With the help of a search and rescue dog and his own Great Dane, they find the source of the fire and a dead body. The arsonist taunts local police with uncannily accurate predictions of how many homes his next fires will burn. When Owen's girlfriend is kidnapped, the race to find her and the arsonist reaches a thrilling climax that will keep you reading late into the night. As a dog lover, I also enjoyed this book for the character of Spot the Great Dane. The dog is as fully developed a character as any of the humans in the story.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for a review. I will definitely be reading more Owen McKenna stories."
5,Tahoe BlowUp,This is a newly discovered author for me. I enjoyed his book very much. Couldn't put it down. I plan to read the remainder of his books..
4,A great find!,"This is the second of Mr. Borg's books that I have read and they have both been very entertaining. The final acts tend to be a bit overboard in the believability department (but that's the nature of the game), and they're a bit formulaic, but they are absolutely thrilling page-turners. Being familiar with the magnificent Tahoe area adds a lot of bonus enjoyment, but these books are not for locals only (I'm not one, but I visit yearly). This is first-rate storytelling. Why this guy hasn't been picked up by a major publisher is beyond me.Do yourself a favor - if you like mysteries, thrillers, great characters, or just plain fun reading, try one of these Tahoe mysteries. You'll likely return for more."
4,A Good Read,"The story opens with a bang, literally, as fire surrounds the house of the main character. And it's not the only fire in the town of Lake Tahoe, as Ownen McKenna and his dog try to ferret out the firebug.This is the second book in the Owen McKenna series, and it was nice to be able to read the second, without knowing anything about the first book.The characters were very well drawn, and the plot kept me turning the pages. Perhaps a bit of a predictable end, as there weren't that many characters in the book, but enjoyable nevertheless.I will definitely be on the lookout for other works by this author.I received a complimentary copy of this book to review."
4,Good Book,I enjoyed the further adventures of Owen McKenna and Spot. I also enjoyed reading how he was going to solve this mystery!
5,Great book...Great series,"This book was hard to put down and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters are believable and fun. I absolutely LOVE the inclusion of Spot the dog. He is an integral part of the book and I hope the rest of the series. I intend to keep going through the Owen McKenna series and I hope that Mr. Borg keeps Owen, Street, and Spot going for many more books."
3,Information of which everyone should be made aware.,"It's sometimes frightening to face the reality of escalating population growth vs. environmental sustainability. The authors are well-known and honored environmentalists that lay out the problems and solutions without fanfare. The book contains alot of hard facts in the way of data, charts, and graphs. At several points this created burdensome reading, but it is information of which everyone should be made aware. Take your reading a bit further and investigate the authors. We need more people like them."
5,asterix and the mansions of the gods: wha the people thought,"This is one of my favourate ASTERIX books with many laughs along the way, ideal for childrean and a perfect christmas present! Kids are bound to love it! We find out that Ceasar and his young architect (squarontheypotenus) are planning to build a new city surrounding asterixs' peaceful village. So asterix and his trusty freind obelix decide that something has to be done, so with a bit of magic along the way the story unveals, giving the romans a headache, the gauls some fun and us well a good laugh!"
5,Magnificent - Hilarious - Superb,"A classic piece of French litterature, and a wonderfull translation. Every joke, every piece of humor is adapted in this English version. A delicacy for the mind."
5,What a great adventure!,"This is one of the best books in the series of Asterix adventures. Finally it has been translated to English so that it can be enjoyed in the US as well. This book is full of reliable historical details. For example, do you know that Caesar in his ""De Bello Gallico"" (translation: ""About the war in Gaul"") talks about himself using the third person? Well, Goscinny and Uderzo knew: this is one of the many ""cultural"" jokes in this beautiful comics book.The graphic is also wonderful. I personally enjoy looking at the brochure presenting ""The mansion of Gods"" to possible buyers. Of course the brochure is engraved in marble.Having read these books as a child in Italy I am looking forward to more translated adventures to enjoy reading together with my kid in the US."
3,The gentrification of the Gaulish village.,"Rene Goscinny, The Mansions of the Gods (Dargaud, 1971)The seventeenth Asterix adventure, and (at least if you're going through the library system) seemingly the hardest to get hold of-- perhaps because the title doesn't have ""Asterix"" or ""Obelix"" in it. Caesar has a new plan for getting the Gaulish village to acquiesce-- develop the forest around it into Roman housing blocks called the Mansions of the Gods. All well and good, except, of course, the Gauls have some tricks up their sleeves for holding construction up, including organizing the workers. Fun stuff, this. ***"
3,Some images outdated,"I ordered this as a gift for my grandson, but after reading it and some additional thought, returned it. The text and many of the images are witty and multilayered, but the depiction of the African character seemed rooted in some pretty outdated stereotypes. I don't consider myself overly politically correct, but while the literary content of this book is still strong, culturally we've moved far enough along that some of the book's visual images seem really out of line."
1,Used Goods,"Unbelievable!! I open the Amazon box and the box is all torn up. I pulled out the plastic container and I thought I was dreaming but the fluid was ~25% gone, no seal under the cap and build-up around the cap screw lines...IT WAS USED!"
4,smells great,purchased this for my father for christmas and he loves the scent. its not easy to find scented powder and he was very happy with this one.
3,more indoors than outdoors,"I like Caswell Massey products so I bought this to try a new scent. The picture of a sailboat and the description suggests outdoor, fresh air type of scent. Don't be fooled. It is super floral - of the type of flowers that are not so fresh-cut and have been indoors already for a few of days. In short, it is more reminiscent of indoor sports than outdoor sports."
4,Definitely different,"Ordered this CD not really sure whether or not I would like the music. I LOVE IT!!!! It is a great CD , especially for someone like me who likes to explore new music from around the world. I really enjoy hearing something out of the mainstream. In fact, the further out of the mainstream the better and more interesting. This CD certainly qualifies on all counts. I am very happy I took the chance and ordered it."
3,The main contents of (On the government of rulers),IM AN ASSISTANT IN THE FACULATY OF ARTS IN CAIRO UNIVERSITY . STAFF MEMBER IN THE DEBRTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY AND I WANT BUY THIS BOOK(ON THE GOVERNMENT OF RULERS)
1,Fell apart!,"This frog fell apart when my husband used it. The first time he wore it, one of the bands came undone. Since he had no other way to wear his sword with his costume, he tried using it a second time- the remaining loops came undone. The sword he uses fits properly, so I don't believe it's a matter of size, but that the frog can't handle any kind of weight if you have an actual sword. Don't buy!!"
3,Easier than making one from scratch.,"You just about NEED a frog if you're going to carry a rapier, so I bought this one. Despite the description, there are no snaps, only rivets. The result is no adjustability. My rapier's scabbard was a very loose fit. I was able to modify the fit by tightening the scabbard loops with some leather lacing. It'll do for now, but I'm going to keep my eyes open for a better one."
4,Works for me,"The frog fits my home-made scabbard (3/4"" diameter PVC, covered in black duct tape) quite nicely, with very little slipping. Great for the price. I do not know why not all the rivets are there, though... Anybody?"
3,What I expected....,I bought four of these and it was what I expected. It will only fit all blade styles when you use less loops in the holder. Also make sure you have a thick enough belt to hold both the frog and sword.
3,Some damaged cases,"Used 300 out of 400 for a client(bought 2 packs of 200). Some had scratches. Usable but not desirable, especially on a paying job. A few had broken hinges. Unusable. So out of 400 around 385 were usable."
3,interesting but frustrating,"I'm afraid Ms. Merkin is a bit anti-women (because anti-feminist), but she writes well. If you are familiar with her sometimes entertaining and gossipy New Yorker pieces, you'll get the same stuff here. A good beach read, but if you are committed to fighting anti-feminism, this book isn't for you."
1,A Major Turnoff,"I was rather appalled at the author's utter lack of refinement. I found her book frequently offensive and vulgar. Her ""open"" discussion of sexual perversion and other delights is right up-to-the moment, but trendiness is no indicator of literary value. Her witty ramblings are as appealing, and about as nutritional, as cotton candy."
1,unpractical overpriced piece,This book is anything but practical and barely touches on how to actually grow mushrooms for 90.00 it's the biggest rip off ever it's barely even 90 pages and the author doesn't even have a decent knowledge of mushrooms himself it's like he recycles the same information throughout the 90 pages like i used to do with my high school term papers also it keeps mentioning illustration and there are none to be found in the book if you buy this book you will most likely regret it. i sure do.
4,Excellent Study,"Makiya's book is THE definitive study of Saddam's Iraq, Pre-Iraqi Freedom. His in-depth review of the linkages between Pan-Arabism and the rise of the Ba'ath party provide an excellent context for the rise of the Saddam Regime. His descriptions of the horrors of Saddam's world are gripping. The only limitation of this book is that it was written years before the fall of Baghdad-it would be fascinating to see what his view of Iraqi society in 2011 is."
3,Good historical background on Iraq and it's politics.,This book goes into great details on the politics of Iraq for the past several decades.
2,okay...but,"I am a backyard DIY mechanic. Also, like many, I am frugal and budget conscious. So I discovered that I required an oil pressure gauge. Searching thru Amazon I came up with this one and purchased it. The assortment of fittings is fine. The hose is also very good. The actual gauge bodies appear chintzy. They are lightweight stamped steel and by holding them and looking at them, I really wonder how accurate they will prove to be. I suppose that for ""ballpark"" pressure readings these will be satisfactory. I would not consider this set to be ""professional"" quality by any means. (Not that I expected a high class precision thing.) If I were to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I woulda, shoulda, coulda, for a few dollars more, purchased something more substantial with respect to the confidence in the tester's accuracy. I have no way of testing or calibrating these gauges. I'm just sayin', by the looks of them, I wouldn't trust 'em."
1,cynical retread of 60's girl groups,"THe Pipettes are cribbing from the 60's girl group bible but not bringing anything fresh in songs or style. Bananarama redux. Amy Winehouse is better for current retro-pop. Buy the Shangri-La's, the Supremes, Ronettes. The Waitresses, the Bangles and the Go-Go's started from the 60's girl group template and went someplace interesting with it. The NY Dolls also did a great take on girl groups and they had a much better look (see the first Dolls cover)."
4,Great 60's style pop from the UK,"Well, the title of this review pretty much says it all: Perfect pop songs from a UK band who started out with a string of singles, culiminating in this full length release. My favorite song right now is ""Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me,"" but ""We Are The Pipettes,"" ""Dirty Mind"" and ""Pull Shapes"" are pretty great, too. In fact, this whole album is pretty solid. The description of their sound as being like the Go Team produced by Phil Spector is pretty dead on, but I think fans of Belle and Sebastian and Camera Obscura will find plenty to like here, too."
4,A solid book on the history of corporate raiders,"I found this book to be filled with fascinating stories about Thomas Evans and other like him who changed the face of Wall Street in the 50's. As far as corporate raiders, most people only think back to the 1980's for when it began. This book will give you insight into how it all began half a century ago. It is not just a single story, but numerous ones about various radiers and the companies they targeted. For anyone who wants to learn about Wall Street history, this book is a must."
5,Overall Good Sleuthing,"I think is it sad, that a worthy first effort has been dragged down in the reviews by some sick individual. (Have a look at all three in the series - Split Seconds, Mall Rats, Matter of Perspective - always two short, meaningless 1/5 reviews). Whoever wrote these reviews must have something against handicapped people and is obviously doing this maliciously, as evident by their anonymous and content-free reviews. The rest of the reviewing community shuns you fool.Anyway, back to the review: The author obviously has chosen the character of ""Stick"" so he can write from a point of view that he knows. As mentioned in the trade reviews, the ending can be a bit pat, but overall a good first sleuthing. I want to give 4 stars - but to counter balance the below useless reviews, I am awarding 5."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH IT!,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER. IT'S NOT REAL MYSTERY AND IT'S BORING. WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? ROBINSON SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES WRITING.
2,good for history buffs,"This is great for those wishing to know about the historical origins of the dow theory, but practically useless for those who want to understand how to apply the dow theory.As one example, there are no graphs or table data on the rail averages (but there are for the djia) which is considered half of what is necessary for the dow theory."
4,Best book about The Dow Theory,"I think this book is the best among the ""classic"" books explaining the Dow Theory.This may be subjective as reading is very personal."
1,Level lost its level,"It worked well for about a week. Now its off by 6 inches on an 11 ft wall. I did not drop it, bump it or abuse it. I even took the batteries out when stored. Don't waste your money."
2,Could be better,"We've had this maching for about a year.Good- It's powerful. Remote control is nice.Bad- Barrel drum is too small. Pleated filter cleaning system is horrible and almost impossible to pull and is a real chore. Without cleaning, the system has no power. Bag below filter tore after several hours of use, however I just take large heavy duty black garbage bags, double them up and they work well. Overall I will be trying to replace the filter with a bag of some sort as cleaning the filter is unrealistic. Bad job Grizzly. I have other Grizzly tools and have good luck with them."
1,Can't get bags - backordred for 3+ months,Can't get plastic bags - backordred for 3+ months. This is the second time - apparently normal for Grizzly.
1,Wrong ingredients,"This product is unscented, but that's all that's right about it.The listed ingredients are different than what is actually in the bottle. The main difference is that the shampoo contains the harsh cleanser sodium myreth sulfate, which damages the hair and scalp. This was not listed under the ingredients."
3,I tried many fragrance free shampoos and conditioners,"including this one. I have very sensitive skin and fragrance issues. Even natural scents from unscented products bug me. I also have oily skin and hair. Because of the oil issue types I fall in this didn't work for me but otherwise it would have. It is not a clean rinse shampoo and that is a big reason I no longer use it.If your like me or want fabulous shiny clean hair I recommend what I use which is clean and clear from psico company. I use their shampoo and conditioner. It's pricey unfortunatly and not really available at most online or off line stores. But it cleans your hair AND SCALP wonderfully. If you have psioris or dandruff that needs special shampoo it assists well with them but don't use it exclusivly. Psico is the company website name you can go to also. Free and clear is better at cleaning and is for all hair types but, it is not tear free. If that doesn't work check out Paula's products on her website."
5,One of the best I've tried,"I get migraines from fragrances, so have been searching for a good fragrance-free shampoo. All products I have tried dry out my hair, but this product seems somewhat better than most (although I think this is due more to the conditioner than the shampoo). This product lathers well and seems to add some body as it shampoos, but does cause tangles that you need to comb out. Even some products that claim to be fragrance-free have a detectable odor, but I have detected no odor with this product at all.I ordered several bottles at once to save on future S&H; charges. The product arrived promptly and was 12 oz. bottles, so no problems there. Overall, I would recommend trying this product if you are searching for a fragrance-free alternative."
3,Same name--same shampoo?,"I'm wondering how this Earth Science Fragrance-free shampoo (which I'vefound acceptable)differs Earth Science product with exactly the same name and a different price. I've searched for Earth Science Chamomle Shampoo for special occasions because it adds body and lustre with no noticeable irritation or itching, at least with a single application. That's 'chamomile.'"
5,"Great Shampoo, bad supplier","I'm very sensitive to chemicals and this shampoo is great. Unfortunately, I ordered 17oz and only got 12oz....a month and a half late. Needless to say, I won't be using Vitamin Shoppe again."
1,"Formula has recently been changed, be aware!","Recently, the company changed the formula for the product. I had used the previous formula for years and loved it and would have rated it 5 stars. The new formula causes my eyes to burn throughout the day and leaves me with a headache. These types of reactions are individual and your results may be completely different. But be aware, if you previously used the green bottle formula, what you will be purchasing now is different so you may want to move cautiously before buying in bulk. They also reduced the amount you get in a bottle."
2,Didn't Like It,I've been trying multiple types of natural dandruff shampoos. This one rated the worse for me. They suggested this to help dandruff and it didn't do a thing plus it left my hair oily and itchy. Not to go off on a tangent but Aubrey's has a Selenium formula Dandruff Shampoo that takes care of 95% of my dandruff problem caused by dermal psoriasis. Aubrey's isn't offered on Amazon :( so you'll have to go to thier site.
1,This book needs an editor!,"I am trying to learn Spanish and this book is helping to familiarize me with all aspect of the language, however I am finding so many mis- prints and wrong answers in the answer key that it is making me doubt everything else I am trying to learn. Seriously, did anyone edit or check answers in this book? The author and publishing company should be embarrassed. I would not reccomend this edition to anyone unless they were just brushing up on their Spanish and would know a mis- print when they see it."
2,Dumbed-down text,"I bought this book to supplement a set of CD's for learning Spanish. I was dissapointed in the way the book was layed out--not quite a dictionary, not quite a learning text. It has been very difficult for me to find references to particular parts of laguage, especially specific words and phrases--it was difficult to find different ways to say 'please' and 'thank you'! It looks like I made a bad choice in a supplemental book. The Idiot's guide, I suppose, is meant to be used starting at the front cover and moving to the back. It may be a good teaching tool when used this way, but has been a very dissapointing reference for me in my efforts to learn a little Spanish."
1,Useful only for TRUE idiots,"As a sometimes Spanish teacher, I was stunned when a student brought me this book and then couldn't figure out why they hadn't learned Spanish. Most of the information in the title is so basic it could be found anywhere, the meat of grammar and other important concepts is concealed in outright silliness, and the book strikes me as being incomplete, even in what it covers. If you want to learn Spanish, spend the money on a REAL textbook. It may not have the cutesy cartoons and the inane humor, but it will certainly have more substantial information for the serious learner of the Spanish language."
1,Appropriately titled,"I considered buying this book, but was apalled when I glanced at the section which claims that each syllable in a Spanish word has equal stress, unless there is an accent. Everyone who has ever studied Spanish for more than two days knows that this is incorrect. In fact, the rules are simple: if the word ends in a vowel or in an ""n"" or an ""s"", the accent is on the next to the last syllable. Otherwise, it's on the last syllable. If these rules are not followed, then an accent is required over the accented syllable. Or am I studying some other language..."
4,Lives up to the series,"I have a high standard for nonfiction books. They have to be easy to understand AND pack in a large amount of information. This series, ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to..."", is really the best out there. This book lives up to that title. It is a great resource once you've mastered the language, but it also takes it from the very beginning for people who've never even thought about learning a language before. The guide is written in an understandable way and is still informative and fun. If you are even remotely interesting in learning the Spanish language, this is a valuable resource that is definitely not a waste of money!"
1,Full of typos,I found many typos and/or errors in the spelling. Dangerous if one does not have some prior knowledge of Spanish.
2,Not very helpful.,"Maybe it's just me, and I need something more along the lines of ""The Hopeless Moron's Guide"", etc., but I'm disappointed in this book. It's very disorganized and confusing. One of the major failings is that, instead of following a step-by-step progression, the author has come up with what can only be described as a hodge-podge. Material that should be covered in later chapters appears in the early ones.Also, it would be very helpful if vocabulary words included examples of the words (especially verb conjugations) as used in complete sentences, with both English and Spanish translations. Unfortunately, this is not the case.In short, if one is a beginner to Spanish language study, this book is probably only going to discourage the reader. It's certainly had that effect on me."
3,book should have more work,"This book was really great. It gave the phonetics of almost anyhting you could run into. It was very clear. The chapters are OK but I would like to have more workbook type pages at the end of the chapters or sections. This book tells you to put everything you just learned on index cards on your fridge and then practice everyday.. I am using the book in a group setting and no one has time to do this index card stuff. and without more practice in the book, you don't remember what you learned 3 days ago.Also this book does not have a dictionary in the back that has all of the words being used in the chapters. Not the best book for group s."
4,This bra is a must,The Playtex 18 Hour Soft cup bra is a must for anybody who loves value. With a hard to find size such as 40B I gasped when I saw this bra. I had to order two.
5,playtex 18 hour bra,I have been wearing this bra for as many years as i can remember----they are the most comfortable of ANY bra and I've tries many other kinds--I have had problems getting my size in stores---34-B---and i was SO pleased to find them on Amazon and at a considerably lower price than in other stores or catalogues---thanks for having them and in my size----
2,Sizing,"Playtex Women's 18 Hour Original Comfort Strap Bra #4693This bra runs smaller than other Playtex products. I recommend ordering a size larger, including cup size."
1,Strange fit,"Usually, when you order from a specific line (Playtex 18-hour for instance), when you find a bra that fits, you know that any bra in that line will have the same fit.Not in this case; and that is frustrating.Ordered my uaual size in this brand, but this style (20/27) fit nothing like other bras in Playtex 18-hour line. Band fit a size smaller; cup a size larger. Don't know if bra was miss-sized, miss-identified, or what.Checked the return specifications. Way too complicated to bother with. Stuffed it back in the box and will hold it for next charity clothing drive."
4,Playtex 18 hr. soft cup original,I received my soft cup bra yesterday. I had a positive experience with Amazon.com. was disappointed with one feature advertised in the description. The bra was advertised to have non strech straps on cups DD and DDD. There is still a small amount of elastic toward the bottom of the strap. My size is 48DDD and I need all the uplift possible. Any elastic is never strong enough to hold the size of DDD.
2,Not so handy creel,I found after I received this item that the pouches are not very usable due to the sizes that they are. It is perfect for holding fish as long as you don't need to carry much fishing gear as well (which I do cause I am great at getting my line caught on things). Unfortunately I was disappointed and only use this one as a backup. I do like the color!
1,Poor quality control,"I spent the better part of one morning this week trying to buy one of these in my town. Three large sporting goods stores carried them. The first one I bought had the strap sewn on backwards. I took it back. At each store I went to, everyone was assembled backwards. One was even sewn with the strap twisted so that it would have to be re-sewn to hang right. The quality overall is great except that they are useless unless you take the strap off and sew it on right. I have been using this kind of creel for over 40 years and this is the first time I have seen this problem. What do you expect from China?"
2,May contain lead,"So I wanted a cheap creel in case I decide to not release something I catch (a rarity). Well careful what you wish for, because for less than $15.00 I got this decently constructed creel which was of higher quality than I expected, but there is a caveat on the tag that says it may contain lead. This is somewhat troubling because, now I'm not sure if this is something I should keep, due to issues of lead in trout streams. I'm sure the minor amount of lead in this very light creel is negligible, but I would have appreciated a little blurb on the product description about its leaden construction. I'll probably hang on to it until I find something better (and lead-free)."
5,"sexy, and I will tell!","The models on the cover are so NOT the characters I picture in the book! arg! Also I have a problem with unprotected sex with someone you've known hours (not weeks, not months... hours/days). That is my huge complaint with this story and I don't think that part was needed for the story AT ALL.Now that my rant on those two details is over I can tell you what I really think: Kiss and tell is a flat sexy fabulous book. Jake is so pure raw essence of man... I could swoon just thinking about it. Marnie (our heroine) is strong but very female. It's a pure fantasy- sexy stranger, danger, trapped in the remote wilderness. Sexy, adventure filled, and definitely a book I re-read once in a while! :)"
3,iffy reading; total no brainer,Not sure what the hype is about this book. I found it dull. Hot parts yes but overall dull.
5,A Great Romantic Suspense!,"This book is a definite keeper. From the first page to the last, it grips you. From the danger to the romance between Marnie and Jake you will get hooked on this story. Marnie is a woman who knows what she wants and goes after it and is not afraid to fight. Jake is a fighter and had to learn about love and fighting for the one he loves.I hated to see the book end. I want to read more about Marnie and Jake. I hope she does books on Marnie's brothers. This is my first book by Cherry Adair, and it will not be my last."
4,Good but...,I liked this book but I like the characters in the first book better. Still worth reading and I hope to read the next in the series soon.
5,I wish I could give this more than 5 stars,"This is the best book I have read in the past year. If you haven't read it yet, you are missing out!! I can't wait to read her other books. I hope she writes a book about one of Marnie's brothers so that we can see how Marnie and jake turn out."
3,It's still a Cherry tale.,"Pretty thin plot and the chatacters are not stellar, but I guess I'm just comfortable with her style, because I enjoyed reading this book. I would just like to see the installment writers push themselves more and maybe take some chances with the direction of the storylines and the characters. This book suffers from an all to familiar predictability"
3,Not a total waste of time,"This was a very interesting, fast paced adventure. With witty dialogue and a good story line. It doesn't deserve a derogatory review, but...it was a little far fetched. Like an intimate shower scene a few hours after both hero and heroine are ailing in one way or another. The intimate scenes were nice and steamy, as far as the puppy goes, not even Lassie was that clever. The hero was good, but could have been a little nicer at some point. And the author constantly used slang words, some of which I haven't even heard. The inconsistencies could be annoying, but if read with an open mind, this is an enjoyable read."
4,Must read this one!,This is a really good suspense romance. Marnie's grandmother has recently passed away. She goes to visit her grandmother's cabin and the meets a stranger named Jake. Jake quickly becomes involved in Marnie's life. Now he has to keep her safe from the bad guys who are trying to kill him. You have to read it to find out exactly what happens. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good suspense book.
3,"Kiss, Kiss and more Kiss","Marnie goes to her Grandmother's old cabin in the Sierra mountains for a weekend to reflect upon her life and set a more daring course. She didn't bargain for getting caught up in Jake Dolan's world of terrorist intrigue but that's what happened. He's trying to deal with assassins and get Marnie home safely.I really enjoyed Jake and Marnie and their romance was off the charts steamy! They couldn't be more different but at the same time perfectly suited for each other. She's funny and he's sardonic so the dialogue was a pleasure to follow.My problem with the book is it didn't seem to integrate the two aspects of the story very well. The romance seemed to be happening independently of the ops segment, which was rather protracted. The romantic tension was perfect but the intrigue related to the terrorists/assassins flagged. While I enjoyed the story, it was just okay. Even so, I'm glad I read it and will continue the series for now."
2,NOT THAT GREAT!!,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. I thought it was BORING!! I read the reviews before I bought it and am alittle stumped by how good they are...Did I miss something???? I would suggest a Nicole Jordon book or Linda Howard or Sandra Brown, or Emma Holly if you want some great romance reading. Don't waste your money. Check it out from the library if you are tempted to see for yourself if you like it."
1,Another annoying heroine,"I've had to stop reading 4 romances in the past few weeks because the heroine annoyed me. Unfortunately, I've added this book to the reject pile, although I know so many people who've loved it. But I just couldn't get past her annoying chatter when they were in trouble. Reminded me too much of Sandra Bullock in 'Speed'. I love Sandra, but when was ""Annie"" going to get that maybe they were in big trouble and stop the bantering? I felt the same with this heroine, and so decided to spend my time elsewhere."
2,depressing with lacklustre hero,"The hereoine's sister has been abducted by sleazy, sadistic druglord with horrid mother. The heroine, a kindergarten teacher from california who takes ballet goes to rescue her, and finds former fling lover posing as evil scientist to druglord.The plot was so unbelievable and the hero was so shallow, i had a hard time finishing the book. The hero loved the heroine because she was beautiful, loyal, courageous,etc.,but other than being handsome and sexy what did the hero have to offer? I could never figure that one out.The heroes were too heroic and the bad guys too bad, with nothing inbetween. Disappointing"
4,AN EXCITING ADVENTURE,"This book makes me want to read more of Ms. Adair's work. I think that's high praise. Lots of excitement and sexual tension in this one. Sure there are some parts that are a little (!) unbelievable, but you'll go willingly into this story. Interesting and strong main characters with problems on both sides. Original. A keeper. Buy it!"
4,Good writing and great characters,"Good writing and great characters, what more could you ask for? This was the first book I read by Cherry Adair, but it won't be my last. Her writing style and character development reminds me a lot of Linda Howard (need I say more). In a nutshell the book is about a super-spy guy (with a bruised and battered heart), meeting his soul mate in the form of a feisty petite blond. Add an affectionate Grate Dane and some extremely nasty ""baddies"", and you get one memorable book."
5,Wow--I can't wait for her next book!,The two previous reviews have said it all. I fell in love with the Jake and Marnie (and Duchess). What a wonderful new author. And I loved Cherry Adair's message under Editorial Reviews. Check it out. Her sense of humor is wonderful.
5,This Book is a Keeper,"What a great read. This story moves along at a rapid pace and is full of adventure, humor and great characters, including the Great Dane. Marnie is not your everyday average heroine and she has a delightful sense of humor. Our hero is everthing a hero should be and then some.I have read and reread this several times, and cannnot wait for the next book. This an author I look forward to collecting."
4,quick and fun,"Sure the theme is old -- nice girl meets military stud. You probably won't be surprised when they face danger and find love. But if you like Linda Howard, you will like Cherry Adair. The writing is crisp, the dialog is fun and other than a happy ending, you can't tell what will happen next. Jake's a stud, I wouldn't mind meeting a on lonely mountain and Marnie is just plain fun. It truely is ""a sassy, sexy roller coaster ride""."
2,Cliche,"I would not recommend this book...OK...Maybe you will call me picky but I am looking for the original...the gutsy portrat of human feelings and souls...true conflicts and passions when I pick a book....well written and intense captivating stories...the same old, same old doesn't do it for me anymore...so If I don't find that ""it"" factor that screams these characters have skin and blood and their guts are clearly portrayed through pages filed with a narative that flows ...I just won't say I liked what I read...There is a lot to the romance style and it will never be what it can be if we always settle for the same old cliche....SO far, the only writter that has fully accomplished that... in my opinion... is Diana Gabaldon...that my friends is a good writter...but I'll kep on searching...keep on siping from all authors and books that fall on my lap...I want to find more amazing romance writters and novels....I a sure I will....but Kiss and Tell was not one of those...sorry"
1,size of a matchbox car,"thankfully i opened the package right away when i received it - totally not what i thought - they are the size of matchbox cars, maybe smallerwill return"
3,Polly Wheels,I bought this toy based on one of the reviews that stated the toy has batteries - it does NOT! Cute and I think my granddaughter will like them. She's really into Polly Pocket anything.
3,Watch dimensions!,"This toy is very small, cars are only about two inches long, the dolls barely measure an inch tall. I tried to find it at Wal-Mart and Shopko to see if I could exchange it, they don't carry it."
2,Make sure to read about size,I bought these assuming they were larger cars. You think I would have learned by now to read the fine print.
2,Just a big advertisement really...,"This is the second Vault guide that I have read, and the second disappointment that I have had with this series. I really isn't a career guide at all, just a very short back ground on what IB is. You can find a description of IB on the internet for free. The only redeeming value is the ""day in a life of"", but even then, there are only a dozen pages or so. In all, you can find most of what is in the book for free on the internet. I won't be buying any more vault products, as they have little information, and more pages of ads for other vault products than pages of usefull information."
1,"LOTS of grammatical errors, sparse useful info","Let me just say that there are waaay better books out there on the subject, even if you just want to get a brief rundown. And you needn't even be a grammar nut like myself to feel antsy about when the next spelling or syntax error is going to show up, because there's an average of one per page. Honestly, I couldn't get through half the book, but I'm pretty sure there was nothing in the latter pages to make up for it."
3,Blue Lodge History,"If your looking for a book of wild conspiracy theories about the Masons this isn't the book for you. What this is, is a somewhat dry historical and sociological study of Masonic lodges in America from 1880 to 1930. I can't imagine this interesting anybody but someone doing mainstream historical research on the Freemasons but if thats your cup of tea then you might want to give this a read."
3,Not the best,"Jeff Healey can be brilliant and has produced some magic tracks. Unfortunately there are not many on this CD. His best album in my opinion is 'See the Light' of which only 'Confidence Man' and 'See the Light' appear here. Any best of should include 'Roadhouse Blues', 'Blue Jean Blues', 'Highway 49', 'As the Years Go Passing By', 'Holding on', 'I Think I Love You Too Much' for starters. There is a definite gap in recording/production quality of some of the tracks on this album which creates a negative feeling. Jeff can tend towards the flashy which definitely spoilt the concert I saw of him some years back, but when he plays with reserve and true blues feeling, he is worth every dollar. On this album the gap between styles is also too great. 'It could all get blown away' highlights the best, 'Shapes of things' the worst."
2,"NO WAY, PAL !!!","No way on Earth this is the ""very best of Jeff Healey"" !!! The album "" HELL TO PAY"" alone is much better than this one. Some songs are great, but the majority are boring and dry blues. Irc !"
1,Nothing but hatred,What at first glance appears to be a book about the crime of slaying police officers soon uncloaks itself as a self-serving medium of hatred. If you can stomach the first few pages you will be drawn into some bazaar cathartic rant on the evils of law enforcement.If I had to guess I'd say the author is venting after some run in with law enforcement.Your money is better spent elsewhere.
3,"After 7 months of flawless operation, the left reel keeps locking up.","I bought this blank tape to use in my VHS security camera/vcr to keep an eye on some low life neighbors. The tape worked perfectly since May, being recorded and erased on a continual daily basis. Recently, the left reel keeps locking up inside the cassette and the tape won't run in the vcr. I took the cassette apart and everything seems to look okay. But as soon as it is inserted into the vcr, it will not run. I checked the vcr and other tapes run fine, so I know there is something wrong with this tape. I am going to try another one and see if I can return this one to Maxell as they say they have a ""limited"" lifetime warranty on it."
1,Messed up after a months use,"The picture quality at the beginning was outstanding. Real crisp and clear, but over a period of a month, little lines started showing up in my recordings. I was going to return the item, but my return window has expired. I guess you get what you pay for. I do not believe I will purchase this item again in the future."
3,"Good, Not Great","As a long time collector of vintage and antique charms I was disappointed with this book. The charms listed were so pedestrain. With so much wonderful stuff out there the articulated charms were almost ignored, as were the gold charms.Good for a novice. I wouldn't recommend it to a true charm collector."
4,Yum.,"I have become a serious collector of vintage and antique charm jewelry and I've also assembled some themed bracelets for family.This book was pointed out to me, I did not know of it, and after reading it I knew some of the girls would love and need it too, to discover how charms came about and from where some originated, although population from The Year Dot have always had their talismans and voodoo symbols to hold on to.This books goes some way towards telling that story: photographic wonderful examples are displayed.I have five books on vintage/antique charms, this is certainly the largest in format. Thankyou for this book it's wonderful reference book, coffee table book, picture book, history book, treasure book, feelgood book.If you don't want to buy the jewelry, you can buy the pictures.Recommended."
3,"The Ovverstreet Grading Guide is a good book, but.......","I agree with with other reviews on this book. What i would have liked to see from it was exactly haw many points do you take of for a certian defect.For example, If i have a MINT 100 with a 1/4 inch corner crease on front cover, how many points would i take off, what if it was on the rear cover, would it be the same?They give examples of books but don't realy tell you how they came up with the points for the book."
2,Nutrition advice based on religion,There is some good nutritional and lifestyle advice here for the beginner but the information is based on lds religious belief. For me the book was not useful at all since I already am well read in this genre. The book was recommended by another source and I find myself wondering what that person was thinking and why I didn't realize what it was before buying a copy. Perhaps for someone just starting to think about how food and nutrition impacts there well being it would be a possible religious based starting point. :-)
4,Fun read. 31/2-4 stars,"Not since ""Rules Of Engagement"" have I enjoyed a book more by this author. The heroine was delightful, the supporting cast just as enjoyable. Mary and her sisters are hilarious in their antics, however, Ms. Caskie allows Mary to shine. The story is Mary's and not `bogged down' with too many scenes involving her siblings. The driving scene is my favorite.The only issues I had, which are my personal preferences, were the story was told virtually from the heroine's point-of-view. I really wanted to know what was going on in Rogan's head. The plus side is with Ms. Caskie's talent in story telling, I almost didn't mind. I found the character of Mary extremely likeable and well-developed. Rogan's, however, was a disappointment. The love scenes were mild and I felt no sexual tension.That said, Ms. Caskie's writing is so talented, I couldn't help but read every word. ""HTSAD"" is just a tamer read than I am used to and many readers looking for this type of book will absolutely love it."
2,"Sort of dumb, actually.","The heroine belongs in the ""too stupid to live"" category. The hero is a fribble. And in what universe does a gentleman ask a lady to wait for him while he is escorting another lady around for a few weeks?I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews. I should have <yawn!> saved my money. This one went in the recycling pile before I even finished it."
1,so so stupid,"This book is actually very stupid and it is poorly written. The plot is not deep and the characters (oh lawd) are nonsensical. I was really irritated and this book put me to sleep several times. People, save your precious money and buy a better book."
2,The Royle Sister Disaster,"Though normally a Kathryn Caskie fan (i.e. the Sinclair series), the entire concept of three silly sisters attempting to prove themselves of royal blood was close to nauseating.I must have masochistic tendencies to have read past the first chapter that included bodies covered in rice powder to pose as marble statuary.Have not and will not read another of this series though am looking forward to the third episode of the ""Seven Deadly Sinclairs""."
3,...,"I didn't really love Mary at first. She was a bit bossy and prissy, and I never understood why she thought of Rogan as a rake either. The romance was just too slow for me. They're so hostile to each other the whole time, and that is so annoying after a while. It's an okay tactic to use, but it can't last too long, otherwise the reader gets fed up and doesn't understand how they could possibly end up together.Though the sex scene (that's right, there was only one) was very steamy, the book was written sort of...well, not professionally. It was too easy to read.Also, Caskie wrote the losing-virginity scene the same way in The Most Wicked of Sins. And it's a horribly unrealistic and unromantic scene."
2,Painful,"Over the years, I had read all of Le Carre's books except for this one. I recently decided to give ""Naive"" a try, notwithstanding the departure from a ""spy"" theme. Subject matter aside, which is a two man, one woman love triangle, the book is painfully slow. While I usually find Le Carre's character development to be compelling, and his books hard to put down, I had great difficulty getting through the middle of this one. I'd never before read one of his books and found myself anxious to be finished. I'm an enormous Le Carre fan--I think of him as my favorate author. Nonetheless, my advice is to skip this book."

5,A MUST HAVE,"This CD is perfect for lovers of alternative 80's music. I bought this 2-disc compilation over a year ago and it is still my ""most listened to"" CD. The songs lead into one another so that the music is continuous. I didn't like this idea at first, but it is actually very well done. The songs on this CD are great 80's songs, but not often found on the other numerous 80's compilations that seem to all have the same pop songs. Bottom line: If you are of true fan of eighties music, you must buy this CD!"
2,A little saddend...,"Im not the Anime Fan I used to be. In fact, I havent read a manga or watched one for a few years now (mainly because of what an ***expensive*** addiction it is). For some reason, I decided to watch all three in order again (these were the first DVD's I ever Had!) to pass the time.The first two were light, funny, and silly movies, which I enjoyed very much. Then I got to the third one, which was actually my former favorite movie, and I really saw what people had been dissapointed in in this film! The whole mood of the story was very dramatic and depressing! This is NOTHING like the usual Tenchi Fun and Laugther! Although I did laugh a couple times during this movie, it was sad to see Tenchi this way, ending on such a sour note! I'd really wish they'd make a fourth one, OLD-Tenchi style to end it RIGHT!"
4,God movie,"The reason it's rated R is because of some pretty 'hot' parts, (if you know what I mean)and partial nudity...Over all I love the movie. If you like romance & Tenchi, this is for you!"
4,Actually I would give it 4 1/2 if possible,"Well, there isn't much more to say that hasn't been said. Having been through all the reviews I was kinda worried Tenchi in Love 2 wouldn't be good. But I must say after watching it I just don't get what the fuss is all about. Sure the animation is different and sure I'm not exactly the end all be all Tenchi fans (only saw the tv series, heh), but I think this is a very well made movie with heavy symbolism on all sides. About the roles of the other women, I think they were more than just 'for the fans' but that's just my opinion. Overall it is a good ending to the saga, and I'm kinda glad it did end that way. I recommend it highly, unless you need fighting in your anime, which I don't. And yes, despite the serious tone it takes there are more than a few wisecracks tucked in there to tickle you funny bone. So what are ya waiting for? Go buy it!"
3,A Good Conclusion to the series,"I have been looking all over for this movie after I saw the first two. However, it didn't turn out as good as it's precedessors. Tenchi Forever is a love story with a nice setting. The characters are full of emotions, but the scenes are repetitive and the story is moving very slow. Overall, the atmospere is pretty low key. There were no ""actions"" (don't expect any exciting fighting scenes) in the entire movie. I think the producers want to do something different since this is possibly the conclusion; they are much more concentrate on character development. The love battle between the two female characters finally draw to a nice conclusion, which is good. The draw back of the movie is the lacking of humor (May be it is necessary for the character to grow up a bit), but it's a little too boring. The bottom line is ""even though Tenchi Forever is not like the other Tenchi movie/TV, it is still a good story. I would say it's above average. :)"
4,"Goodbye, Tenchi...?","I really hope that this isn't the last we see of Tenchi and the gang because it seems they went out on sort of a meloncoly note. The film itself was tremindous! Especially the way Ryoko and Aieka actually worked together and not trying to kill each other over Tenchi. There's a new fem trying to steal Tenchi's heart. Will she succeed or will Ryoko and Aieka stop her? You'll have to buy the DVD to find out. It's reasonably priced. And everybody from the cast is here but in much smaller roles than usual (although Washu has a pretty good chunk of screen time). The plot generally concentrates on Aieka, Ryoko and Tenchi. Oh, and the 'Mystery Woman'."
4,Tenchi the Movie III,"This movie, unlike the other Tenchi movies, is more of a soap opera than an action anime. Since this movie was the first Tenchi movie that I purchased I can't say that I was disappointed. This movie, of course, contains all of the original characters except for one that you will soon meet by the name of Haruna. Haruna, once in love with Yosho (Tenchi's grandfather and resigned prince of Jurai) dies on her long journey to earth. Her Jurain tree was planted on earth and, even though she was DEAD, ""sprung back to life"" because she felt decieved by Yosho since he had married someone else and had Achika (Tenchi's mother, who soon had Tenchi). As revenge she captured Tenchi and drew him into her own world made only of her desires. Now it's the gang's turn to bring back Tenchi with Washu's genius help. Since this movie has a couple nudity scenes I'd recommend it to those who are 14 and up."
4,"It's Tenchi, sorta","The same old charaters we all love, but none of the action. This movie has some great drama, though. Can anyone suggest a better translation for Tenchi's ""Big, warm, comforting hands""? ;-)"
1,Awful,"I don't know why this movie is getting five star reviews. I found this a complete dissapointment and the majority of my friends agreed. I don't care about the fact that it's serious, it just isn't Tenchi at all. It's the Haruna story with the Tenchi cast making a few appearences and someone named Tenchi around who's really a paper bag. I feel bad for anyone who thinks this is the high point of this wonderful series and am very glad that the director will not be returning for any future Tenchi stories. Skip it and buy the rest the OVA or the manga which are excellent."
1,The Worst Tenchi Movie,"I hated this Tenchi movie. I hated the animation, there was not action. This was not a Tenchi movie, it only had the charactors from Tenchi in it. The plot was so slow, and the whole movie was very depressing, I will probaly never watch this movie again, even though I paid almost thirty dollars for it. It was so depressing that I had to immediatly watch another Tenchi episode just to get the bad taste of this movie out of my mouth."
2,could have been better,"Oh Tenchi, poor poor Tenchi. What to say about Tenchi Forever? First off, I am absoloutely positive that the same people who brought the OVA series to life keeled over and were replaced by high animators who had no idea what the cast of Tenchi was supposed to look like! Second, even though the plot was semi-original many elements from the original Tenchi movie were reused. (Aka Tenchi disappearing with everyone there to help/look for him.) Haruna was okay, but I definetly could have done without the sex scenes. C'mon! Tenchi is supposed to be this wholesome guy whose stuck with all of these alien women and has the manners to accept them all for who they are and not to lay a finger on them! So...in conclusion, I advise anyone considering buying this movie to purchase the first two Tenchi movies before watching this one, so you can cleanse your mind of the memory of this shotty end to a great series!"
2,Worst of the 3 movies,"Someone here left a review claiming that this was the best of the Tenchi movies with a revealing conclusion to Tenchi/Aeka/Ryoko saga. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!It didn't give you the same feeling you get from the OAV/OVA series or the first two movies. The graphics are worse. It lacked the upbeat atmosphere from those familiar silliness. (Sorry, Washu-chan didn't even crack a single joke!) It lacked the feel of romance to help carry the excitement throughout the whole movie. What can I say? I just barely kept my eyes open to see that grand finale only to find out that it wasn't much of a conclusion to the Tenchi/Aeka/Ryoko saga. If you really loved the second movie, Daughter of the Darkness/Manatsu no Eve, don't expect to watch this movie over and over again. You are better off reading the No Need For Tenchi! comic books, which continue the OAV series."
4,Very good but incomplete...,"I love the Techi series and have seen the OVA series and the movies. The animation is of supreme quality, and the music is excellent, even though it becomes overpowering sometimes. What I don't understand is how Haruna fit into the whole scheme...Yosho isn't really an old man (for those of you who watched the OVA series), and I thought he left Jurai to fight Ryoko, not to run away with Haruna...despite the holes in the plot and the less than satisfactory ending (C'mon people, don't be afraid to ditch the loser and actually show the winner...subtlety does not cut it), it was a good movie and very moving...Watch it!"
3,Blaaahhhh,"This movie was average, so I gave it three stars. I absolutely loved Tenchi Muyo!, Tenchi Universe and the first movie. Tenchi Forever, on the other hand, disappointed me. I felt this movie was a little boring, predictable and nothing new to the Tenchi community. And you should really follow the R rating...."
2,Far too sappy,"I've pretty much got everything anime related to Tenchi, and if I had to give anything up, this definitely would be an easy first choice. The usual comical aspects of Tenchi are only to be found in about the first 5 minutes, and past that it just turns into a boring, irritatingly sedimental piece of... well, you get the point. Even diehard Tenchi fans I think will be disappointed in this one and it should be avoided."
1,Yuck!,"I really hope they don't plan on ending the Tenchi franchise with this piece of garbage.It's drawn like Tenchi in Tokyo (which I'm not a fan of). There's no action (fighting). Tenchi does however get some action, which is really unlike the OVA series & Tenchi Universe. This movie could have done without a lot of things, & I could have done without this movie."
5,Very Good,This movie was very good in mmy eyes.Its was funny and exciting though the whole movie..I think it was had wonderful animation.. I would reccoment this movie to any anime lover.And i can't wait to see the third one..i have herad many good reviews about it.
1,Forever Sucks,Man this movie stinks. First of all it revolves to much around this obsessive ghost woman. Then there's the porn scene. Man this was the dummest purchase I ever made besides starship troopers. In my opinion you shouldn't buy this movie. If you want to0 see it so bad then ask to borrow it from a friend.
2,This was a disappointment.,This is no way near as good as the three series or the other two films. Don't bother buying it. I was disillusioned and heartbroken. I now hate all the world.
4,Woman's Ordeal with IBD,"A humorous, touching autobiographical account of one woman's ordeal with IBD, from initial procedures and eventual diagnosis to surgery and gradual recovery. This is a story of courage, grit and determination with which many people with IBD can probably relate and it will pull your heartstrings"
2,You have to be good at Calculus for this to help,"This book is not helpful if your calculus skills are not strong. Rather helping you work through it, it gives you information and then assumes you should be able to apply it right off the bat. If you're a talented mathematician and this shouldn't be a problem for you then buy this book. If you prefer to have things explained to you then I wouldn't recommend it. Though I agree with an earlier review, that the historical notes at the end of a chapter are intriguing and a good idea."
1,too much one note,"It starts off well and you feel you can drift to another plane or your body dance to the rhythm; then, the drumming becomes monotonous - drones on and on repetitively seemingly one note until it becomes tedious and wearisome. Kudos though that they were able to carry on this drumming for such a dreary mind-numbing length of time."
4,Pretty,This is what I'd hoped it would be. Love the opening bail - more pendants need to be made with opening bails. I bought 3 of these and gave 2 as gifts. Both were well received!
3,"OK, but not as pictured","""The enhancer I received was a light green turquoise which was fine. However, all three beads were monotone with no matrix/shading whatsovever. It looks fake and plastic. I have purchased several Relios items, and this is the first item I've received an item that is not as the photo depicted. I plan to keep it, but will use as a stocking stuffer."""
5,Sash! has reached his peak!!,"This is the best dance track of 1998. Tina's smooth, seductive vocals go well on this track. Can Sash! better this??"
5,L-Carnitine,"Twin Lab brand is among the best I have tried for L-Carnitine. It gives me more than a boost of energy, it seems to even suppress my appetite. Besides, it's extremely affordable and delivered right at your door. I give this product and subscription program from amazon a 5 star rating."
5,Carnitine is a Very Good Friend!,I recommend this product to anyone and everyone in the world. I gave this particular brand five stars because I've never been able to buy a 90-day supply for just 20 bucks!
3,Expensive,"These are large pills, so keep that in mind if you have trouble taking large pills.But what I really want to comment on is the price- these are expensive. It's not bad for a 90 count if you take one per day. But according to the label you need to take 4 a day ""to achieve the clinically supported results of metabolizing fat into energy and supporting cardiovascular function"". Taking that into account 90 tablets lasts 22.5 days. This is a less than 1 month supply."
3,Undecided,"I'm not sure that this product was highly beneficial, but it could be my body chemistry, who knows. It has worked for others, but it didn't really do anything for me."
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't like the flavor. Twelve ounces is too small. I use large ""therapeutic doses, as recommended by my cardiologist. It might work for someone who takes it as a precautionary supplement, but isn't for me."
1,Very biased,"This ""biography"" of Krishnamurti is very biased, not only against the Theosophical Society, but also regarding Krishnamurti himself. The author seems not to have understood not only the meaning and depth of Krishnamurti's teachings, but also his life, which he's supposedly trying to explain ""objectively"", as he says. If you want to read interesting biographies of Krishnamurti, read those written by Mary Lutyens and Pupul Jayakar, who knew Krishnamurti personally for a long time, whereas Vernon is only collecting information and giving his biased opinions and interpretations. You can also read interesting books about Krishnamurti like Michael Krohnen's ""The Kitchen Chronicles"", Sidney Field's ""The Reluctant Messiah"" or Ingram Smith's ""The Transparent Mind"", but don't waste your time and money with this book."
1,Whether he is the Messiah is surely not important,"""Whether I am the World Teacher or the Messiah or something else is surely not important. If it is important to you then you will miss the truth of what I am saying because you will judge by the label - and the label is so flimsy. Somebody will say that I am the Messiah and somebody else will say that I am not and then where are you? What is important is to find out whether what I say is the truth by examining it and finding out whether it can be worked out in daily life. The speaker is speaking for himself, not for anybody else. He may be deceiving himself, he may be trying to pretend to be something or other. He may be, you don't know. So have a great deal of scepticism, doubt, question."" J.Krishnamurti"
1,KNOCK OFFS,These are not real naughty monkeys. I bought these and they were beyond cheaply made. If you really like these buy the ones that amazon has for 74.95. $19.95 is a rip off!
5,One of my favorites,There is one thing that I like in this episode more than in any other - drawing! Landscapes of Switzerland in this book truly show Uderzo's talent.
4,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"A wonderfully done book in which Asterix, Obelix, and Getafix, must save a roman inspector that has been poisened by an evil roman governor. To save the inspectors life they must travel to the mountains in Switzerland to get a flower that can heal him."
4,Magic Fondue?,"""Asterix in Switzerland"" is the sixteenth Asterix comic, first published in France in 1970. It's a fairly good one, and I liked it.The Governor of Condatum loves his Roman orgies, and has been taking the taxes for the Roman Empire and putting them in his own savings. A Quaestor from Rome comes to investigate, and the Governor poisons him. Dying, the Quaestor sends for Getafix, who has a reputation for medicine out in Gaul. He, and his friends Asterix and Obelix come to visit him in bed. Getafix can heal the man, but he needs the Edelweiss flower, and the best specimens come from the mountains in Helvetia, so Asterix and Obelix are sent to find it...It's worth a look for Asterix fans."
3,"One-trick pony, but at least it's a funny trick.","Rene Goscinny, Asterix in Switzerland (Dargaud, 1970)A corrupt Roman official poisons a tax collector, and Getafix is called in to cure him (since the Roman doctors are unable to do anything). Getafix requires an Edelweiss blossom for the antidote, and thus sends Asterix and Obelix off to Switzerland to get it. Another of the books where Goscinny actually tries to fulfill the original idea of using the Asterix books to teach something (geography always was Asterix and Obelix's best subject); it's quite fun in places, but the contrast of the slovenliness of the charges under the jurisdiction of the corrupt Roman and the orderliness of the Swiss tends to wear a little thin. ***"
4,Fantastic Visual References.,"It's really terrific to see so many creative depictions of mermaids and the like in one little book. I really enjoyed the different perspectives- some terrifying, others humorous, all outstanding in their own unique way."
2,Too expensive,This book could have been cheaper.The content is about identical to Bruce's but this one costs much more.This is just my personal opinions...
1,False Ad!,This book is not Hardcover as stated in the ad. The book is not for sale in the US and Canada and it is clearly marked on the cover. It's violating the Copyright Act. I gave it one star because there was anything lower than that.
4,look...,"I have an unhealthy obsession with the all american rejects, but it does not stop me from being honest. Dirty Little secret is an overrated song, which is good but, lets face it, cheesy and slightly annoying. Like most of the nearly-good singles around, this track has been played TOO MANY TIMES!Swing, Swing will never lose its amazingness soo buy the cd ... you will not be dissappointed if you keep this review in mind."
1,Misleading and inaccurate political propaganda,"This video is an attempt to spread a particular religious and political ideology, Christian Americanism--the idea that America was founded as and should remain a distinctively Christian nation. Its arguments consist of various quotations from the Founding Fathers, mostly taken out of context, and arguments and claims that don't hold up to logic, scrutiny, or further research. The video ignores any evidence contrary to its viewpoint. (Jefferson Bible, anyone? How about the writings of James Madison?) David Barton is neither a historian nor an educator; he is a political activist who runs a company dedicated to opposing the separation of church and state. There is no shortage of good, readable scholarship on the very important topic of religion and the founding of America--read the books and skip this video."
5,After the Flood,"This was agreat puzzle. My children and I spend several hours at night working on puzzles. It's a great family time project, besides it makes them have to use their brians, matching up colors or looking for the right puzzle piece. Even my 15 year old gets in on the fun. This puzzle was so pretty when we finished it we decided to frame it and hang it in my daughter's room. Thank you Melissa and Doug, and Amaazon for carrying their products."
4,"Fun Puzzle, Vibrant Colors","We were looking for a fun puzzle that would be a balance of challenging and yet attainable for first-time puzzle people. This is it! We loved Melissa $ Doug's ""After the Flood"" puzzle and will put it together again soon. It only took my husband and I several hours tag-team, but again, we were looking for one evening's worth of entertainment. One drawback: a dozen or so pieces had corners peeling up, so I glued those back down - no big deal. I suppose it is that way with any puzzle. The best aspect of this puzzle is the vibrant colors and fun details!"
1,Junk!,Their puzzles are in the worst condition we've ever seen!The layers of the pieces were seperating and many bent pieces!NOT very interlocking either.I will never buy the Melissa & Doug puzzles again!
2,After The Flood,"This puzzle was not as much fun as we had thought it would be. Many of the pieces were damaged but they were all there.We finished the puzzle, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,A Ho-Hum,"I purchased this puzzle based on the reviews on Amazon, but I was disappointed in the quality of the pieces. The pieces were warped and layers splitting. Yes, I put it together and liked the picture, but it went off to the library for donation. Quite disappointing."
2,Pretty...but disappointing,"I was happy with this watch, until after only 2 weeks of wearing it the band broke. I did not even wear this everyday. I am going to try and have the band fixed, but this is not what I expected for a watch this pricey."
1,Well...,"Well I WAS going to give this book a really good chance, but after reading what they said about Weezer in the Kiss reviews I just threw the damn thing in the fireplace."
4,a good second opinion,"I think people really missed the point on this book. The intro pretty much tells you what the criteria was for the selection of the bands reviewed, admitting that it's cool to like Abba and Cheap Trick and still dig the Sun City Girls or John Zorn. It also implies that it's necessary to have a well balanced musical scope so maybe you can make informed opinions and maybe get a record you wouldn't have otherwise. Y'know that whole opening the doors to new music thing. And yeah, it's Spin but the Rolling Stone Guide is worthless and Trouser Press is only 90's rock (but obviously great), the writing is well rounded and gasp! entertaining in itself not taking anything seriously very seriously. Not for DIY punk ethic types who only read illegible xeroxed zines and think barcodes are the work of Satan (Cher)."
2,All Style No Substance,"The candidates for inclusion are baffling (AC/DC is great but hardly alternative), the album ratings at times preposterous (a 10 for the Go Gos ""Beauty And The Beat""), the know-it-all ""hip"" factor generally grating if not unbearable. Rob Sheffield has got to be the worst rock critic of all-time (with apologies to Chuck Eddy and Lorraine Ali). It's amazing that this guy writes for a living when people with actual writing talent have to go out and get real jobs. It's a good book for discovering artists that you might have never heard of before, but the reviews themselves are very weak and narrow-minded; hate to tell you, but there was rock n' roll before the Velvet Underground. There was this group called the Beatles, for instance..."
3,"Very informative,but the reviewers are very annoying","I used to like looking through this book for the informaion it gave on artists or their records. However,the critics (weisbard,sheffield,etc) are very annoying and act like they (as one amazon reviewer said) are too cool to be listening to some of these albums. One example is the ignorant review of Never Mind The Bollocks,Here's The Sex Pistols."
2,One of the WORST record guides ever.,"All fluff and no stuff. They spent too much money on the printing and the four-color pages than the actual writing. Superficial reviews with no understanding for the music, incomplete discographies, incomplete band listings, unecessary artwork, and bad columnists. DJ Spooky actually mentions HIMSELF in his review of Orbital. What a waste. Oh, and I got it as a gift in case you were wondering... try The Trouser Press Guide(s) and The Rough Guide to Rock. Much, much better!"
4,Forgotten and Gone,"This book is a good resource to learn about many groups that are forgotten and gone but which might interest you. The worst part of the book are the Rob Sheffield reviews, which are almost always wrong, whether in overall quality or in the ranking of the albums an artist made. Still, you can laugh at him and say ""What a maroon!"" when he gets on your nerves too much."
3,"Inconsistent, but a good overview","This guide is a wonderful book to help music listeners get an idea of the vast scope the word ""alternative"" covers. Still, there are problems. Artists like Madonna, Teena Marie and Cyndi Lauper should not have been included, simply because there is no alternative in their music. Also, the reviews can be inconsistent, particularly by critic Rob Sheeffield. He gives The Smiths' ""Meat Is Murder"" a 2, yet gives Susannah Hoffs ""When You're A Boy"" (a blatant sell-out if there was one) a 8! The Top 100 Alternative releases are also botched and perplexing. Still, it is a good source, though The All Music Guide and Trouser Press guides are better"
1,disappointed,Any slouch socks I have ever purchased were very loose on the cuff part -allowing you to push them down to the desired height. These socks were nothing more than crew socks and there was just no length or width to push them down at all. I will never purchase them again.
4,Remember Compaq luggables?,"This has the size that rivals the Compaq ""luggable"" computer of the 1980s! It's heavy, big. It's fully of high-end features for its time. 8 Speakers and glossy 20"" display just turn heads. Excellent for marketing demos in business, and good enough as a gaming machine...again, for its time.Two hard disk slots are very useful. Wireless keyboard and mouse can actually go good 60 feet at least (in a line of sight). Front loading DVD drive is also a unique feature.The problem as of 2010 is the drivers for Windows 7. While it runs, there isn't custom drivers and software to take advantage of various features on this machine."
1,Don't you dare even think about buying this computer.,"I have already had to get mine replaced twice. DELL pretended like they never made this, decided to ""stick their heads in the mud"" (from the mouth of one of their own employees). Nothing works the way it is supposed to and DELL will NOT back this pc. Just check with all the listings at the better business bureau, that is who I had to finally go through in order to get a resolution. I would just sell it to recoup some of the original cost (5,000.00 +) but I would not be able to do it in good conscience. Please don't do it! I would not even give it a full star but I have not choice."
3,Dell XPS M2010,"When I am working on this computer around other people they are always impressed because they had never seen one. I didn't either because Dell did not promote it and discontinued it very quickly. My biggest complaint is that I paid full price shortly before Dell sold out their inventory at half price. I could have purchased three top of the line XPS laptops for what I paid for the M2010 portable. It is still under a three year warranty, but Dell will not respond to my complaint."
1,Don't purchase this piece of junk!!!,"This unit had mulitple failures, everything was replaced at one point or another in time span of less than a year. It has a major reliability/design issue. I had it repaired just last week and it failed again. Don't waste your money on this laptop. I have had many Dell products before and this XPS M2010 is the only one that does not meet my expectation. I was very disappointed with recent Dell performance both in their technical support and customer service personnel. They keep transferring my call and even hang up on me. Dell tech support even lied to me on system replacement. I am fed up with their excuses and Dell has moved to bottom of my list of future PC suppliers."
5,LogRhythm Recording Studio,"GREAT PC - a ""portable desktop"" that delivers. Does everything it says it can do. Has the advantages of a large screen computer that you can actually fold up and take with you - in my case, I use it for remote music performance recordings as well as business applications."
1,CULT JARGON,Reader beware this is a form of cult jargon that will result in the ruin of your business and your life -- take this advice from a reader and ex 4-day brainwashing training seminar attendee...
4,Wonderfully Painful! A core self examination tool!,"Reading this book was very eye opening. The expressed thoughts of how people think and react was very informative and gave new insight to some of my old patterns. This book is a must for anyone in between ""I have my life all together"" to ""Man I wish I could start all over again""! So, many possibilities were opened up to me after I studied this. And for the price - it is a must!"
4,Quality living is not easy,"This book can wreck your world, especially if you've become comfortable living as a victim. It's so easy to point fingers of blame at circumstances, parents, peers, bosses, and bad luck - but personal responsibility and action can turn a life around.I've read it, and recommend it to anyone interested in taking an honest look at what's at work in life & relationships. Not a particularly easy read, it can be wordy and complex - but well worth the effort! I encourage you to try it on, and see if it fits."
5,Completely adorable,"Both books in this DUETS are completely adorable. Funny, innovative and a darned good time. I read them both at one sitting. Don't miss this volume."
4,con law case summaries,"the case book is pretty bad so this is a big help, but your might need additional supplements to get through con law."
4,Great stuff from Pauly.,"Even though his song writing suffers greatly as of late, you can catch up on the good stuff before Paul went all cheeseball. Maybe I'm Amazed is such a great song."
3,Everything a boxed set isn't,"To you true Wings fans (like myself) you will be disappointed by the comiplation here. No new releases, no demos no alternate cuts. Some even is not Wings music just McCartney fill-ins. I guess that I was looking for a boxed set (which doesn't exist) and wound up with this. All of the Wings songs are on their previous albums so if you're looking for something new, look elsewhere. Very disappointed. (The 3 stars are only because ""They Are Wings""."
3,All you need from Paul McCartney is this cd,"I belive this cd includes all the 3 styles of Paul McCartney after the beatles time. R&B, soft pop, soft rock.Along with the ""back in the USSR"" is all Paul McCartney (solo)offered in rock music."
4,MCCARTNEY BRINGS BACK SOME GOOD TIMES,"Paul McCartney brings back some good times with ""Jet"", ""Silly Love Songs"", ""Let 'Em In"", ""Take It Away"" and the list goes on.A man of full distinction with a career that definitely goes full circle.A very good compilation that gets (4) stars instead of (5) because he is missing other hits as ""Ebony & Ivory"", ""Say Say Say"", ""Wonderful Christmastime"", and others.Still a great collection for the Beatle-esque/Wing afficianado. Paul McCartney ranks up there as one of the best pop writer/singers of all time, and to succeed after the Beatles with his band Wings with hits like ""My Love"", ""Jet"", ""Band On the Run"", etc. is a feat all its own.A very good collection that brings back very good music of what pop music once was and should still be."
4,A difficult task!,"With the musical catalog that Paul McCartney boasts, it's not surprising that Paul's selections couldn't please EVERYONE - me, for one. But, then again, Paul's thought process regarding what tracks go on an album and which ones don't get put on, has always puzzled me a little bit.Although a brilliant collection (how could it not be?), there are some tracks on ""Wingspan"" that I would have omitted, and replaced with other - more memorable - Wings tracks. Would have loved to have seen tunes like ""Girl's School"", ""Sally G"", ""Baby's Request"" and ""Dear Boy"" on there somewhere... and I'm bummed that tracks like ""Venus and Mars/Rock Show"" were edited to the point where I just can't listen to them. This all compells me to ask a question:Paul, how's about a boxed set??? Please?!?!?!?"
3,"Selective ""Hits and History""","Listening to Paul McCartney's two-disc ""Wingspan"" raises several questions. Where's the focus - is it a McCartney or Wings overview? Where are the great B-sides, such as ""Zoo Gang"" and ""Lunch Box/Odd Sox""? Why are there so many tracks from the ""McCartney"" and ""Ram"" albums, yet no room for the excellent live recording of ""Maybe I'm Amazed""? And do we really need TWO versions of ""No More Lonely Nights""? Needless to say, ""Wingspan"" could have been a stronger McCartney compilation (even the liner notes are lacking). Still, there are some classic Wings tracks as well as a few unheralded gems, particularly ""C Moon"" and ""Girlfriend."" What McCartney really needs (and deserves) is a comprehensive box set. ""Wingspan"" only scratches the surface."
5,KatMc,This has quickly become my favorite CD. Never knew Paul's wife could harmonize so beautifully. Music is fun to exercise to and his songwriting is fab.
3,We need a boxed set.,"I think everyone thinks like I do. There are too many songs that got left off of this baby. There are some great songs on English EPs and 12 inch singles (""Hanglide"" and ""I'll Give You a Ring"" are two that I remember) not to mention all the B-sides from the US and Britain. I also bet there are some good unreleased things floating around. My favorite Wings songs don't usually make compilations (Favorite albums are ""Back to the Egg"" and ""Press to Play"") A 5 disc boxed set is what we need and we really don't need one with all the hits. Come on, Paul reward your fans. I have 85 CDs by either the Beatles or Wings or Paul McCartney. I deserve a boxed set to pull together all those loose ends. You're the greatest ever."
4,Could have used a few more hits and a few less album tracks,"This is the best Paul McCartney ""greatest hits"" collection available. It includes most of his big hits and some of his better non-hit songs, along with a few mediocre songs that must have been special to him. Several of these songs have become classics still receiving airplay today. While it is very difficult compiling a career spanning collection for an artist as proficient and successful as McCartney, so there will always be disagreement about what songs to include, but I would have liked to have seen a few more hits and few less album cuts in this collection."
4,"Great value, but song selection could have been better.","I just want to point out that even though this is a super value, Paul's song selection was not the best. There are some bad selections (not to say they are bad songs) on the History side (ie: Man We Was Lonely, Heart of the Country, Girlfriend, Waterfalls, Bip Bop medley, No More Lonely Nights again, and Too Many People in my opinion). I think many of these were included because they were probably Linda's favorites, and summed up the period of that time for them. Also, the Hits CD is basically All the Best with the exception of some welcome new songs (Hi Hi Hi, Pipes of Peace, and Mull of Kintyre). I would have liked to see Getting Closer, Old Siam Sir, Arrow Through Me, Beware My Love, Somebody Who Cares, The Mess, Spies Like Us, Monkberry Moon Delight, Eat at Home, On the Way, Big Barn Bed, Love in Song, and Morse Moose and the Grey Goose."
5,Essential,"""Wingspan"" is a great collection. Even though I'm a McCartney fan I never could get my hands on ""Daytime, Nightime Suffering"" which made this even more essential. I suppose it was hard to follow up The Beatles - if Wings had any other front man, they would be considered legendary. I guess it was just expected from Sir Paul. In any event, Wings churned out some great songs and seemed to benefit from the changing lineup.Enjoy"
3,THIS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"Most of these songs have been rehashed on at least two other albums/CDs: Wings Greatest Hits and All My Best. I really can't argue about the song selections on Wingspan and they really sound fantastic. But with compilation sets such as this, you're always going to get your fill of unsatisfied customers who feel certain songs were left out. In my case, I have but two objections. First, why not give us the extended version of ""With A Little Luck"" instead of the so-called radio version? And second, where is ""Give Ireland Back To The Irish?"" Now, I can live with the radio version of ""With A Little Luck"" but had they included a clean, remastered version of ""Give Ireland Back To The Irish"" on this retrospective CD, I would have given Wingspan a 5 star rating. Very disappointing this great McCartney song/classic was omitted."
4,"""Wingspan"" a broad retrospective","""Wingspan"" is a fine compilation, which now includes tracks previously missing from 1978's ""Wings Greatest"". The ""Hits"" CD offers tracks available on ""Wings Greatest"" or ""All The Best"" with the exclusion of ""Ebony And Ivory"" and ""Say Say Say"" (I guess Paul still feels a chill towards former pal Michael Jackson) and the inclusion of the pleasant ""Pipes Of Peace"". The ""History"" CD is a collection of Paul's personal favorites such as the little heard ""Daytime Nightime Suffering"", ""The Lovely Linda"" and ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", which finally made it onto a compilation. I enjoy the tracks on the ""History"" CD and although some might dispute the selections they are, as I said, Paul's favorites. Nonetheless, with over two hours of music (40 tracks) for the price of one CD this is a great bargain."
4,The Post-Beatles Collection,"For those who had slightly written McCartney off for a few of his sillier 'pop' hits, one might want to take a listen to what may be his swan song collection. The big hits are here wether you like them or not, but the real treasures are packed in like his first great solo hit, ""Another Day"".""Give Ireland Back To The Irish"" was originally included in the first pressing, but deleted later due to a request from the friggin' Queen. Paul was knighted by her - so out of respect? Too bad.Disc One sticks to the Top 40. Disc Two is a great surprise, giving up great songs album cuts like, ""Heart Of The Country"", ""Back Seat Of My Car"", ""Too Many People"" and the sultry, ""Let Me Roll It"". McCartney even publicly trashed his old ditty ""Bip Bop"", but it stands as a reminder to his simple craftsmanship. That of one half of the greatest songwriting team in history."
3,Makes a Better Case for Paul,"Releasing Wingspan: Hits & History as a two-disc set is a good move by Paul McCartney, because quite frankly the hits don't hold up by themselves. On Hits, only ""Live and Let Die"" has any bite or emotional power. ""Band on the Run"" and ""Uncle Albert"" are by-the-numbers song suites, all craft and no content. ""My Love"" and ""With a Little Luck"" are way too fluffy, and ""Goodnight Tonight"" is pure garbage. At least Paul spares us his horrid 80s duets with Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.On the other hand, the album cuts on disc two are quite revealing. ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" is one of Paul's finest songs ever, even with the Fab Four. ""Heart of the Country"" is a great little folk tune, and ""Let Me Roll It"" gives Paul a rare chance to emote on record. Not everything on History works, of course, but it does show that Paul had more on his mind than just writing throwaways and bubblegum pop after the 60s ended."
5,Should have been a 3CD set,"Everything here is great, no doubt about that. I think every fan would add a song or two to this collection; well, I cant understand why he left 'Here Today' off the album. And of course, you need another 2 CD collection for all the greatest hits and history since 'Flowers in the Dirt'."
4,"All the best of Wings, even if you hate Linda McCartney","Okay, okay, I know there are millions of people who still haven't forgiven Paul McCartney for putting his wife in a band, but let's agree that it was, if nothing else, an act of courage considering her aversion to lipstick, blush and a decent haircut. As they say, there's no accounting for taste.Wings was one of the great bands of the 70s, much maligned and sneered at by Lennon devotees (how anyone can think Imagine is a great song is beyond my comprehension!) and Beatles fanatics who just couldn't quite forgive Paul for refusing to let Lennon and Ono drive the bus over the cliff. Pick this up for a dose of very decent rock and roll--especially the great guitar work.Skip the track where Linda sings the lead vocal--it's truly awful."
3,SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE CD,"i like many of the songs on this collection, but, as noted by other reviewer's, too many songs were included on this collection that are ""unknowns"" to be on a ""greatest hits"" type collection. what i do mainly is just listen to one cd but even that is hard to do because the songs aren't listed on the cd and the cd's look alike so i end up putting them both in the cd changer anyway. smart marketing move. but all in all, it is an ok cd set for the money."
3,Wingspan,"If you are a Beatle fan you will like this! I gave it a three because there are songs that I don't like including Listen To What The Man Said, Take It Away, Bip Bop/Hey Diddle, and more. But there are really good highlights of the album and if you like Wings you really got to listen to Hi Hi Hi and C Moon. Listen to Paul McCartney's Early years they are a lot better than his later years. Please try this album out."
3,Could Have Been Much Better,"The song selection here is puzzling. Wings is defined here as primarily Paul and Linda, or just Paul himself. Post Wings songs are included for some odd reason. ""C Moon"" and ""Pipes Of Peace"" are included on ""The Hits"" side ironically enough. Would have liked to have seen little gems like ""Oh Woman, Oh Why"", ""Rainclouds"", ""Mama's Little Girl"", ""Country Dreamer"" on this set. Still waiting for that ever-elusive box set of demos and unreleased tracks. Perhaps in my lifetime?? Paul is a great artist, but I'd avoid this and stick to the individual albums or the other greatest hits packages."
4,An excellent value,"This was the first, and only, Paul McCartney album I've ever purchased. I was happy with the song selection and quality on the two CD set. It's not often that I can get 2 CDs filled with music for less than twenty bucks. However, the liner notes on this album are more than a bit disappointing. Rather than providing insightful background into all of Paul's different albums and songs, it just gives us a hefty load of Paul and Linda pictures. As a beginning fan, I really would've appreciated some more info."
3,Wingspan or Pauls's spam?,"I have always enjoyed Paul's early Wings' material, along with his pre-Wings hits. I even won an official 'Band on the Run' T-shirt from his fun club in '74. But upon review of these two disc I am disappointed. There is much missing from the Wings period, and much added on to the disc that is clearly not of that period. Where is' Mary Had a Little Lamb'('72) or ' Give Ireland Back to the Irish'(72)? I'll bet it is being saved for [a] Box set. [I don't like the] Marketing Paul! Again don't get me wrong I am a true to heart Wings fan and that is why Paul's spam songs of the '80's(non-Wings songs) are grossly out of place on this disc. I am grateful for such inclusions as 'C Moon' and 'Hi Hi Hi' but I can definetly do without 'Pipes of Piece' and 'No More Lonely Nights'. Paul you can not be a completionist by incomplete productions. Here's hoping [a] box set will set the record right."
5,WILL IT NEVER END FOR THE BEATLES,THIS ALBUM IS JUST PROOF THAT WHEN YOU GOT IT NOTHING CAN STOP YOU FROM SHOWING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Wings Over The Universe,"This is definitely the best McCartney/Wings compilation yet. It contains all the same cuts from the American version of ""All the Best"", except for the Paul Mcartney/Michael Jackson duet ""Say Say"" (no real loss here), plus some excelent choice album cuts. Although I'm a bigger Lennon fan, you have to admit Mac's output of quality solo material eclipsed his old Beatle mate. Two complaints: 1.) Paul should have included more of his early solo b-sides (e.g. ""Country Dreamer"", ""The Mess"",""Oh Woman Oh Why"", etc.) Perhaps a future disc of all B sides are in the wings, I mean works. 2.) ""Give Ireland Back To the Irish"" is MIA, despite being listed on the track listing for Disc#1! Did Sir Paul have a last minute change of heart on including this controversial (for 1972... that is) single?"
2,Sorely Lacking Laine,"Hmmm. . .for a Wings greatest hits CD, this is a pretty good Paul McCartney best-of. It amazes me that they can anthologize this group and sell so short the contributions of Denny Laine, who any fan will know was the heart, soul, and muscles of Wings.""Let Em In""? ""Live and Let Die""? ""Band on the Run""? I can live with these, definitely. But where are ""Children Children""? ""Time to Hide""? ""Again and Again and Again""? Unjustly shelved, that's where they are. Making a Wings best of without Denny is akin to making a Beatles best of without John. You just don't do it. As a result, Wings will now continue to be seen mainly as a vehicle for Paul McCartney, when that simply isn't true. Wings was a band. A team. A unit.Now if you'll forgive me, I'm going to go listen to my own self-made version of Wingspan - the DENNY-FIED version!"
1,"WARNING, WILL ROBINSON!!!!!!!!!","Beware, all old Mccartney fans! This compilation contains shortened versions of two of my favorite songs(Junior's Farm & Venus and Mars/Rock Show). Caveat emptor, man. This rest of the tunes seemed to be full length, but I only listened to the ones I like. 1) I wonder if Sir Paul knows, and... 2) I wonder if he even cares. What a turn-off."
1,Absolutely Poor,"This collection is [bad]. The only decent songs are ""Let Me Roll It"" and i guess thta's it. I borrowed this cd and was disgusted. You'll like John Lennon and George Harrison better. Sorry Paul, we don't like your muzak."
5,The '70s revisited,"I used to hear a lot of the songs on Wingspan - Hits And History on the radio in the 1970s. I bought this two-disc set the day after Super Bowl XXXIX when Paul McCartney gave what I still feel is the best halftime performance ever at the Super Bowl. This set contains so many Wings hits from the '70s that I heard on the radio throughout the '70s and still hear to this day. Songs like Silly Love Songs, Listen To What The Man Said, Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Live And Let Die, Let 'Em In, Jet, Band On The Run, With A Little Luck, Maybe I'm Amazed, Take It Away, Man We Was Lonely, Let Me Roll It, and more.McCartney as we all know is one of the Beatles. His solo career has been equally brilliant and this two-disc set proves it. This set doesn't have ALL the hits, but it does have most of them. McCartney is a legend. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,I just don't know...,"I bought this recently, sort of on impulse, because it was really cheap, and I've been meaning to get some more solo Paul on disc. In retrospect, I kind of wish I'd bought _Flaming Pie_ or _Run Devil Run_ instead. Listening to this made me realize something... a lot of Paul McCartney's solo music gives me the creeps. I'm thinking about things like ""Coming Up"", ""Goodnight Tonight"", and ""No More Lonely Nights"" here. Now, understand, I'm a huge Beatle fan, and have been since early youth, but some of this stuff... well, it's kinda like seeing your best friend turned into a zombie before your very eyes."
3,I just don't know...,"Hmmm... I bought this on impulse, because it was really cheap, and I've meant to get some more solo Paul for a while. Having listened to it, though, I sort of wish I'd bought Flaming Pie or Run Devil Run instead. Hearing this stuff again made me realize something - a lot of Paul McCartney's solo music really freaks me out. I'm thinking about ""Coming Up"", ""Goodnight Tonight"", and ""No More Lonely Nights"" in particular. Now, understand, I am an enormous Beatles fan, and have been since early youth. But listening to this... well, it's sort of like seeing your best friend turned into a zombie, before your very eyes."
5,"A Straight To the Point, Short and Sweet Review...","....memorable tunes most of us grew up with. Fun, fast, pop, funky, melodic, upbeat--a ""you-get-your-money's-worth"" 2 CD set. ""Wingspan"" promises to do what ""Beatles 1"" did for parent/offspring sing-alongs....get both and have fun!"
3,The Best Really Are Out Of The Top Drawer.,"With 40 songs over 2.5 hours there must be something for everyone from fomer Beatle Paul.However to be honest the vast majority just don't hit the high spots for me.When it comes to the best there is Band On The Run, Live And Let Die, Jet and Maybe I/m Amazed.These can really stand beside any outstanding recordings from 1970s.To give him credit Paul shows no sign of retiring, which many 1960s stars did long ago."
5,"Please ignore the negative, a must have.","A bit about me - B.M. Berklee Col. Of Music, studied with Gary Burton, Mike Stern, Jeff Berlin, Bob Berg etc. Lots of gigs and then an MBA to pay the bills. Does this mean I know what I'm talking about - no. But, it means I've heard a bunch both good and bad. Yes, the synth tone is God awful and the production values are sub-terrain an but this is the single best DVD to help you navigate 'jazz' changes. Mr. Henderson revels how scales relate to chords in a systematic and though manner that will give the tools to unlock your ability to play modern chord progressions. The section of the DVD devoted to phrasing is brilliant - a must have if you want to avoid the stream of eights-notes saying nothing that is so easy to fall into. It will take some studying on your part and good deal of sheading before you can make this material 'yours' but it is such a valuable tool I cannot imagine a cheaper and easier way to get from point A to B."
3,Jazz rock mastery,The first part of the dvd featuring 'Screech' from t.v's 'saved by the bell' is the best part but the second part featuring 'Side show bob' from 'The simpsons' is quite painful to watch because of the facial expressions!
1,Garbage... A Waste of Money,"First I'd like to say I'm a Professional Guitarist 24/7 and have been Playing 35+ years and I have a Music DVD & Book Library that could Rival Amazons. This video is ""Garbage"". I'd even go as far to say this should be the ""Poster DVD"" for ""Don't Let This Happen To Your Playing"". It's basically Scott Henderson Droning a note on a ""Synth Guitar"" which sounds terrible, and then playing every scale and arpeggio over it, just drifting from mode, to mode, to mode, to mode ...etc. In the 2 hours of watching this video, there's not even ""One"" memorable riff.This is purely ""Cerebral"" Scales ( I won't even call it music ). This DVD will teach you how to be great ""Musicologist"", but ""Not"" how to be a great ""Musician"". If you want to learn this type of stuff check out ""Jimmy Bruno's No Nonsense Jazz Guitar"" DVD. Jimmy Bruno gives you "" Six Scales"" that cover all the modes and uses them in an extremely musical way. 'Nuff said!"
3,Only got for some Tips,"Used to own a Diet Center and just got the book again for some good recipes I remembered. The recipes are nothing compared to the diet program Body for Life recipe book called Eating for Life, now that's some good recipes."
1,What the heck,"My pre-teen downloaded this and was embarrassed to admit she had. It is so antiquated. Oh well, live and learn!"
1,"Not a very interesting book, even for teachers.",This book is very boring. I archived this book after the first paragraph. This was a waste of my time. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!
3,Southern Belles,"Tom Tierney's Fashions of the Old South paperdolls are pretty good, but not his finest work. There are several dolls, including two women, six children, and two confederate soldiers, and many plates of costumes. Included in the costumes are a riding habit, a house dress, a nightgown, a wedding dress, and a ball gown with Spanish-styled mantilla. While the costumes are historically accurate and very detailed, the color combinations are not always aesthetically pleasing. One of the prettiest dresses doesn't quite fit the doll. And I really didn't like the fact that four of the children are grouped together as one paperdoll. I liked the notes on each costume in the book, and found them very helpful. If you're a collector of antebellum stuff, you need to get these. But if you just want some pretty paperdolls, you might want to get a different book."
4,Mathematical Snapshots,"Mathematical Snapshots is a wonderful excursion into the mind of a mathematician. It answers a question that was asked of the author ""You claim to be a mathematician; well, what does one do all day when one is a mathematician?"" This book explores games, the computation of shortest paths, why two soap bubbles blown from the same pipe are different sizes, how to pursue another boat on the open water, how to color maps, the simplest forms of solid objects, mobius strips, where to locate schools, the ideal musical scale, and many, many others. Each topic is presented in a short, concise paragraph along with a diagram or picture of explanation. The author asks the reader to supply answers and reasoning. It is readily readable by those with mathematical inclination (even if they can no longer `push' the numbers) and provides hours of enjoyment and expansion of the mind."
2,"Culture, power, love and sci fi Delany style.",This novel was published nearly a decade after Delany's winning four Nebula Awards. The novel seems to be a bit rusty in contrast to his other works. It is also more mainstream than his other works.A good starting point for those who a just exploring this author.
5,Lyrical review,"I have just written an essay on this book for Birkbeck College. I think it is a truly wonderful book. Lyrical, sad, moving. It is written and set in 1930's London and I can imagine so much of the scenery. Not (underlined) that I can remember 1930's London, just my imigination and looking at old photos. I have tried to find out more about RL, but I have not been able to discover very much. Just tantalising bits. Is is a lovely book and I reccommend it. Avis Judd"
1,Seat split open rendering it useless,"We purchased this Kohler toilet seat because we thought it would be durable, and we also liked the quiet-close feature. Well, after 5 months, the lower part of the seat completely split open near one of the feet that makes contact with the toilet. I'm a 175 lb male and my spouse is petite. We certainly didn't overload it. I read another review here that mentioned the seat splitting. Think twice before buying this toilet seat."
3,"Things that make you go, hmmm?","Ok, this is a great idea and initially, it works very well. The idea is a welcome one and solves the problem of the banging seat syndrome however, after a little more than one year of light use, (it's installed within a master en-suite, no children involved), the spring no longer functions and the upper, top seat, slams shut. Great idea, short term investment."
1,Lousy design - expected more from Kohler,"The hinge design on this seat it terrible. It's not good out of the box and it only gets worse as time goes on until the seat just slides around every time you sit. I just replaced it with the Mayfair wood quiet-close, it's got a much better hinge design and the seat feels much more substantial than the thin plastic of the Kohler."
1,Poor design/manufacturing,"I'm an engineer. This toilet seat is poorly manufactured. The tolerances on the hinge mechanism are such that the slow close will not always work. I took the seat apart to see why and the cam that fits into the seat cover will not fully engage because of the sloppy manufacturing. When the cam does not engage you get the big slam. I have replaced two, and will return all and buy a different seat. Interesting that the floor samples in the store have very tight hinges (well made) with no sloppiness and work great."
1,it was too small for the Kohler toilet is was designed for!,The Kohler toilet set is about 1/4 inch too narrow .The ceramic bowl can touch you legs when you sit on it!!!
1,Removable Toilet Seat,"The description indicated that one size fit all. Not even close if you have an elongated toilet seat. It was a terrible fit and the seat arrived with a broken henge. I should have send it back for a refund but waited almost a month before opening the box. The product, at almost $40.00, was a disappointment and a waste of money."
1,"hard to install securely, broke after one month","As others have reported, it's apparently impossible to install the seat securely with the hardware provided. I needed to replace the plastic nuts with standard metal ones and apply a lot of torque to keep the seat from slipping. OK, job done ... except that the seat broke after one month of use. No abuse; the heaviest person to use it was 160 pounds, but the seat part developed a crack that eventually separated and made the entire thing unusable. This is inexcusable for a name-brand full-price product."
5,Toilet seat,This the 2nd seat I have purchased. The seat and lid come down slowly so little ones do not get their fingers pinched when the seat or lid come down. It is GREAT.
1,Disappointed,"Last April, we moved into our home and installed new Kohler Cachet quiet-close seats in our 4 bathrooms. The three elongated seats are fine so far. However, the round-front seat cracked yesterday under the weight of our guest (not a heavy person), much to her surprise. The crack is not a surface crack--the seat separates at the crack. So--it cannot be used without experiencing quite a pinch! Buyer beware!"
2,Returning one now,"I ordered two of these for two toilets. One is fine, the other has the same hinge, wobble problems as other people have reported. It's like the space between the hinges is too short so they are stretched out too wide. One of the hinges just snapped up and off, hitting someone today in the back.I have to return it now which is fairly unpleasant. No one wants to remove a toilet seat and then handle it to repackage.I love the one that does work - great quality - but the other has been a pain in the rump."
2,Uncomfortable throne,"I always thought toilet seats were pretty generic. Wrong!! I bought this because it matched my new toilet and it came up paired with it, as in ""people who bought your toilet also bought this seat"". Well this matches and that's about it. It is uncomfortable for my plus size butt and my husband and his skinny little man butt also found it uncomfortable too. It also almost looks too small for the comode. I bought another seat within a week!! Stay away!!!"
1,Disappointing product,"I purchased this toilet seat 2 months ago and everything was great. And then, just the other day, the seat cracked in half on the left side. Thankfully I avoided getting my leg pinched in this, but I did get my wallet pinched. I was informed by Amazon that I needed to return this product by June 2nd to have received a refund. I advise you do not purchase this product."
5,Koehler toilet seat a winner,"I am pleased with this toilet seat. It is attractive, seems well constructed, and works perfectly (quiet-close feature). A little pricey but worth it."
5,not only quiet but easy to clean,"This is the second of these seats installed, the first one lasted over 5 years, so long ago i don't remember when. The replacement one just snapped on, I didn't even have to reinstall the attachment bolts.This seat can be cleaned in 30 seconds. if you really need to do a thorough job it might take 2 minutes,clip off, clip on.If its really bad take it outside and hose it off.All my toilets have one. The easy off is far more important that the slow close. My wife might tell you that is because i don't close it..."
2,defective seat,the surface of seat has two creases which are indicativeof a potential crack about to occur.I have experiencedthis on a previously owned Kohler toilet seat whichcracked after about 8 years without a warning. We are afamily of 2 adults weighing 140 and 205 pounds not exactly heavyweights.I would like to return it for adifferent brand or style.
3,A different twist on a ghost story,"I enjoyed this book but it is far from my favorite Barbara Michaels' mystery. In this story, Meg is recovering from an accident which is causing hallucinations. She asks her wealthy aunt for assistance and is offered a six month stay in an old, Victorian style house in Pennsylvania. When Meg arrives there she finds that her aunt's stepson, Andy, is living in a small house on the property and serving as a caretaker. Unfortunately, Meg and Andy did not get along as children and get off to a rough start when they meet again as adults. Shortly after moving into the house, Meg has more hallucinations, but this time Andy can see them, too. They soon figure out that they are seeing former residents of a house that used to stand on the site. These are tragic figures and the evil that confronted them is apparently still on the property."
5,One of my favs,"This is one of my favorite books by Barbara Michaels. Although some might consider this ""old fashioned"" they have to realize it was written in the early 70's. Whenever I have a free saturday to sit around and read, I either reach for this or one of my other favorites of hers."
5,superb docu-drama,"i know i gave a review of this a few years a back. but this appeared again in my to be reviewed section for some reason. out of honor and respect for both author and the poor souls who had to endure this, Hail. should be about one of your best all time war ""novel""."
1,Catholic bashing anyone?,"It's one thing to disagree with some aspects of Catholicism but Lockyer takes every opportunity to spew his anti-Catholic venom... from dishonoring Mary to badmouthing the papacy to calling Peter a ""bumbling"" apostle.I had ordered the ""Miracles"" and the ""Apostles"" books that he wrote. I tore them both up and trashed them."
5,from soup to nuts,"Infused with real-world examples and humor and just a little Hollywood edge, Campisi takes you through (from a to z) how to prepare a business plan for investors that even a film-world neophyte can understand and learn from. It's not easy to have your pie-in-the-sky ideas shot down, if you were thinking in vague terms of what a business plan should be. But over and over enthusiasm for the indie newbee and a you-can-do-this attitude make rolling up your sleeves to do the hard work you need to do to wade into the choppy waters film finance, not as hard as you think. I'm using it like a bible right now,as I step into those choppy waters myself and need to catch that Campisi life-preserver he throws into the current now and then. Watery metaphors aside, I highly recommend this book. Besides the appendix rocks with a distilation of the book into a business plan - its worth it to work your way through the book, just for the appendix."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It told me nothing I didn't already know and nothing that isn't available in numerous other books of the same subject matter. Considering the nearly $ 40 price, I thought I was getting a definitive book on the subject matter and I would hardly call it that. Oh but the cover is beautiful. Smart marketing."
1,Doesnt work with my portable DVD player.,"I bought this cable for my Philips portable DVD player, but upon hooking everything up, I get choppy audio and no video. I swapped all the connections around (just in case some of the wires were crossed), but nothing helped.It may be an issue with the DVD player itself though, I can't 100% say that its a faulty cord. For $3, I have a nice addition to my junk drawer."
2,it doesn't work,It does not work with my Western Digital TV Live Plus unit. Outcome of the video is really bad. I wonder why not all 3.5mm to RCA are created equal.
4,Cool,"The item is very good, it works, but came a little slower then expected and a little wet(due to rain)."
4,cord,Make sure you don't throw it our if it's not working properly. The color coding may just be off like mine was. Other than that it is fully functional and gives no problems.
2,Junk,"Junk cable. Sound only comes out of one side, not stereo like it should be. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the price is so cheap I really didn't expect too much."
5,Chilling,"I can't remember the last time a recording turned my entire arm to gooseflesh- Roscoe Holcomb does it on near every song. Listen to him hit some crazy note on ""In the Pines"" and it's scarier than Kurt Cobain could ever dream of. Similar to Dock Boggs but with a loneliness that's completely his own. Absolutely essential."
4,"TRACK LISTING: (((Come on, you know it's a fun song!)))",1. rAdIo EdIt 3:222. ExTeNdEd VeRsIoN 5:033. dIsCO 70s mIx 3:23Light hearted dance pop from the ones who brought you Barbie Girl! Forget about talent and who did or didn't write the song. Do we care if Robert Dinerio does his own stunts? Do we care if the quarterback of our favorite football teams don't plan out the strategy? We enjoy the outcome.Come on and have a fun time with this amusment song. Perhaps the most fun version is the Disco 70's Mix.
5,Barely There,"I purchased Barely There Women's Comfortable Curves Underwire Bra #4364 about five years ago. After puchasing several other brands, I finally found these on the Internet since I could not locate in the store. They are the best for straps staying in place and the cups do not lose there shape after washing in a laundry bag on delicate cycle. Buy the taupe - it goes with anything."
5,Great Price / Fantastic Product,"Found these bras about 3 years ago and purchased 10. Well, three years of washing and some needed replaced. Can't beat the price for the product. Have turned many friends onto the product. Seller was excellent. All arrived in new condition and are wonderful."
2,straps do not tighten enough,because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening. Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable.
2,I'm in no mood for this!,"Have to tell you I am a HUGE fan of the previous Rachel Gibson books. They have intersting stories surrounding the sexy and romantic parts (which is the real reason we all read them!) Sex, Lies and Online Dating, See Jane Score, and Truly Madly Yours are my favorites.I was the first on the list of my library to read this book. Read it in about 3 hours and have to say it did not hold my interest. Played very much to formula. The author worked very hard to throw in references to characters from previous books and lead-ins for future books. Started to remind me why I've soured on Stephanie Laurens and, to a lesser extent, Julia Quinn. With the ""continuing characters"" approach, you can fill at least 15% of the pages of the new book by reintroducing characters and basic story lines from previous books to bring a new reader up to speed. Makes us loyal readers skip over these parts and feel almost like we haven't gotten our money's worth from the new book!"
4,good fun,A romp. If I wasn't laughing I had a smile on my face through most of the stoy. Makes me wish there was really a session for those who are to NICE.
3,Really more like 3.5 stars,"I enjoyed this book, but it was not my favorite out of the series. I liked Clare and Sebastian, but their story did not grab me like some of the others did (mostly Lucy & Quinn and then Maddie & Mick). It's still a good book though."
2,bored,"i read the first chapter of clare's story at the end of 'sex, lies, and online dating' and was completely hyped to read 'i'm in no mood for love!' i even raced to the local library to pick it up, but boy was i disappointed. unlike her other books, gibsons characters were really blah and not very exciting. there was no tangible heat between the characters, nothing to make their separation and return such a big deal. i just wasnt hooked and put it down after getting halfway through. i cant stand not finishing a book so i did finish it but seriously.. not worth it."
2,"Read her earlier books, forget this one","I didn't buy the love story at all. I just didn't believe it. People who are new to Gibson should buy Truly Madly Yours instead because this book is a pale imitation of that one. Some of the lines were straight out of that book, as was the idea for Clare's gift. The oversexed alpha male who comes to ""see the light"" and the uptight undersexed female who can't have sex without strings has just been done, done, done.Gibson can write really fun and hilarious books, I hope she finds that part of herself again."
3,Not Simply Irresistible,"I like Rachel Gibson's books. I read Simply Irresistible a zillion times. I loved See Jane Score and Truly Madly Yours. This book was not like those. It's okay.I'll buy whatever she writes, but this was not one of her best books. There was no tension. I didn't empathize with either of the main characters. I was not invested in the story. It was just okay. And I'll buy her next book, too. I'll just hope for more."
4,It's a romance people,"I don't know who pissed in the negative reviewers oatmeal, but get real people. This was a good book. Was it riveting? NO. Was it keep me on the edge of my seat intense? NO. I didn't realize a book had to be all that to enjoy it. It was a cute piece of fluff. If you are a Rachel Gibson fan and want a sweet book, read this one."
2,Just skip it,The book has many pledges it didn't fulfill an that's the worst could do a writer. The love story per se wasn't a love story and you'll get disappointed as the plot evolves. I really think that are too many love stories and writers to read this one. If I were you I'd skip this one
3,Just so-so,"I love Rachel Gibson. This was one of my least favorite books of hers (True Confessions was the worst). It was just so-so. I didn't particularly like the lead character. Clare is a high-class, well-bred woman who gets drunk and sleeps with strangers when something bad goes wrong in her life. Oh yeah, and she writes romance novels for a living. And the leading man, Sebastian, was just plain arrogant. I like confident -- I think all women do. But a braggart is different. I just couldn't care about their romance. As I write this, I think maybe 3 stars might be too much!I also REALLY hate the cross promotion that Gibson is doing. The previous book, Sex, Lies, and Online Dating was a complete set up for this book. This book not only set up the next book in the series (Tangled Up in You -- a much better read), but for those who read this one first, it also pre-sets-up the first book. UGH!"
2,I'm in no mood for Tedium,"I have previously enjoyed several Rachel Gibson books, Sex, Lies and Online Dating and Lola Carlisle Reveals All among them. Having enjoyed Online Dating, I had high hopes for Love. These hopes were never realized.While the writing was good and the story flowed well, it was really boring. The main characters, Sebastian and Clare, never seemed to interact with each other except at parties thrown at the Wingate estate. The book seemed to be more about Clare's relationship with her mother and Sebastian's relationship with his father than it was about the relationship between the two of them; their relationship never seemed to evolve.I enjoyed both characters, but I never understood why they were together or why I should care about their story."
1,a bummer,"whomever wrote the excerpt on the back cover of the book should be paid more, because she/ he makes the book sounds like it could be an interesting book, but lo and behold when you read it it falls flat. or maybe the author is just good with making up an interesting premise, but fails on execution.it's not a romance to me. sorry ms. gibson, too much things going on but with the romance the story seems it's just scratching on the surface. i think i'll think twice before picking up another book.for a good read, always go for linda howard's, karen robards', jude deveraux's or lindsey's."
2,"""Simply Irresistible"" it ain't","I loved Rachel Gibson's first six books, ""Simply Irresistible"" being one of my all-time favorites. I have continued to read her novels, but with less anticipation each time. Her latest lacks in both an interesting plot and in character development, i.e. likable characters you can connect with. I also recognized some wording that is identical to her other books. There just doesn't seem to be any love lost between her main characters, it's all about sex. Sex without feelings (even the typical unrealized or unadmitted kind) is not romantic. I donate all my books to the library. Maybe I'll go there are check out her old ones."
3,Not one of Ms. Gibson's best...,"I loved everything I'd read by Rachel Gibson up until I read this book. Don't get me wrong, it's fine if you've got nothing better to read but the plot was flat and the characters forgettable. If this is your first book by Rachel Gibson please give her other's a try. Sex, Lies and Online Dating & See Jane Score are two of my favs."
3,"Eh, good one to get from the library","I've been a big fan of Gibson, particular See Jane Score, but I was very disappointed in this one. The beginning was promising--but the rest of the book was pretty darn lackluster. The development of the ""relationship"" was a series of short encounters, variations on ""and then, 3 weeks later, they met up and had sex."" Eh. Not worth buying perhaps, but not a bad library read."
2,Very disappointing,"Not worth the money. Just a bunch of cliches strung together in the pretense of writing. Characters were unrealistic and you never got to the point where you believe in them or cared what they did. Very slow reading. If you want to read sex scenes but don't care about a storyline, you might enjoy this book."
3,"Good for some, but not for others","Do not bother with this book if you already know the basics of environmental care: eat an organic vegan diet, stop driving unless it is ABSOLUTELY necessary, don't waste electricity or any other energy source, & don't overconsume.If, however, you aren't yet clear on the facts about the environmental impact of food, transportation, housing, and resource use, then PLEASE get this book & awaken yourself to the truth."
3,restating the obvious,"Travel less, install more energy efficient appliances and lighting, get better gas mileage in you car, install better insulation in your house, eat less meat. That's most of the book, it does break things down to help you decide what choices make the most difference, but there is no groundbreaking information in here that will change your life. If you want to make an impact on your environmental footprint, you need to make sacrifices in your life, that's what it comes down to. The one thing I did learn was that heating a cup of water in the microwave uses less energy (less wasted heat) that on the stove. But much of the info in this book is interesting statistically, but not really that useful to the average consumer."
3,Somewhat misleading,"This book contains a lot of statistics, but when comparing products they often fail to account for the full product life cycle. For example regarding paper or plastic shopping bags, they focus on the environmental cost of producing the product. They conclude that plastic is 'better' because it uses less energy to produce. They do not consider the post consumer pollution factors associated with plastic; increased rates of littering, endangering wildlife (plastic ingestion) and water/ocean pollution (plastic photo-degrades). In addition they fail to mention reusable bags. They are too focused on numbers, and lack common sense solutions.When reading, remember to think about the full disposal costs.[...]"
3,Pratical Advice,"This book offers a lot of scientific input of our environmental problems, but I think it also gives people a choice to whether they want to make it. I would say that this is a helpful book in gearing people to make smarter choices, but at the same time almost tells people that somethings are not a big deal. Which can be debated. Read it and enjoy."
3,Strange omission,"This was an interesting enough book, if slightly repetitive. The best part about it was telling people not to sweat the small stuff like deciding between paper and plastic bags. But what I found particularly odd was that there was absolutely no mention of cigarettes anywhere. It's strange because tobacco is a crop like fruits and vegetables and therefore effects land use, water pollution, and stuff like that. It's clearly a personal health risk (cancer), and it may contribute to air pollution since there's tar and other toxic chemicals that are released into the air when they're smoked. I can't believe it's more important to eat organic foods than to stop smoking. Why such a glaring omission??"
4,Good book for beginners,"For as long as I can remember, I've had all these fantasies about adventures in backpacking, carrying everything I need with me nomad style, and being a semi-homeless wanderer through both nature and civilization. Books like this just encourage me."
1,"Clarence Carson and A Basic History of the United States,","As with all the volumes of Carson's history of the nation, this volume is usually based on some facts with a heavy dose of his own interpretations. Carson views history, as he does economics, from an ultra-conservative frame of reference. That does not make his interpretations de facto wrong, although this writer considers his views reactionary. My point is to alert readers that there is no attempt a balance; the book is a polemic as it written."
1,Carson is less an historian and more a propagandist in this work.,"Where to start? The author ignores the emerging science of his day, both historical and archeological, to insult and debase the original inhabitants of the new world. The text reverts to biblical quotes and conservative economic theory often enough that despite the wealth of historical minutia it is impossible not to sense an agenda. To use the language of the author, I would recomend this book to religious home schoolers and libertarians who don't mind being percieved as 'backward' and 'inferior' to the rest of society as a whole."
4,enjoyable series,"Ann Maxwell wrote three of the ""Dancer"" books in December 1982 and April and August1983 published by Signet ( Fire Dancer, Dancer's Luck and Dancer's Illusion) She created a wonderful fantasy world and a couple of characters that as in her other Sci-Fi books, have a relationship that is nothing short of wonderful and intense. I am sorry to say that I have waited 16 years for her to finish the series. So far as I know she has not done so. Despite this, readers will truly enjoy these books."
4,Very Good!,"Of all the ""Dancer's"" serie books of Maxwell, this one is I think the second best. I'm a great fan of Maxwell, and thought the book is well writen, the action is well paced, the end chapters is awesome... something was missing. I kept wondering when Maxwell would give us more information about all the mystery between the two races. It's true that she gave us some new glimpses, with the little boy (sorry I forget his name) and his protector (again sorry, a blank spot!) I just hope that something major will happen in the next book of that serie and I do hope there will be another one? Please Ms Maxwell."
4,Flimsy but does the job,"I'm currently using it to isolate an aggressive fish. It works. The construction is very basic -- 2 plastic rectangles connected by 4 plastic sticks, with a net stretched over it. The construction doesn't appear durable and I expect something to fail after several rounds of assembly/disassembly.The ""hooks"" to attach the net to the tank are flexible metal plates that you bend around the edge of the tank. It's ugly, not sturdy, can easily break, and don't appear replaceable. They don't hold the net evenly in place -- the front edge hangs 1/2"" lower than the back. I had to lower the water level in the tank to ensure that the front of the net is above the water line.Overall, it's fine for occasional use and the price is right. But I'd get something better for prolonged use, especially if it's going into a display tank."
4,OK,"It does what I wanted it to do perfectly, but personally I think Hagen's breeder boxes are better(they're also cheaper)."
4,I couldn't put this book down!,"I love reading success stories. Real life stories about real life people.This story about Glenn W. Turner is without a doubt, one of the greatest success stories of all time. A man who was given the least chance to succeed, but succeeded nonetheless.It is also a story about the abuse of power of the government at that time.My only complaint is that GWT didn't go deeper into his ""DARE TO BE GREAT"" Success principles. Perhaps that will be the topic of a future book.All in all, a really interesting book. I would suggest Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill and Maximum Achievement by Brian Tracy for more on the ""how to"" of success.Mr Turner: I hope you write another book that covers more of the ""how to"" of your success and covers more of your ""DARE TO BE GREAT"" success principles."
4,Fitment,"I bought the hat and was hoping it wouldn't be like many other fitted hats... It is as pictured but the small/medium just looked like it had a smaller elastic with the same base as the large/x-large. Took a while but after wearing it in, it looks a little better than the ""trucker"" hat peak on it."
3,Shool required it,If i did not have to buy this i would not but it was required for a class. I got a good deal on it
5,Asterix and Ancient Greece,"It is fun to travel to ancient Greece with our beloved Gaulish village. A story with a comical twist and a nice recreation of Athens with its golden Athena statue, Olympia and other beautiful places. Great work!"
4,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,This is one of those books that will keep you laughing. In this book all the gauls decided to compete in the Olympics against the Romans. It's a book that will put a smile on your face on a gloomy day.
3,Greek Asterix,"The Romans by Vitalstatistix's village are very excited. Their strongest legionaire, Glueteus Maximus, is going to the Greek Olympics. Vitalstatistix, and the rest of his village want to play too. Only Romans and Greeks are allowed. Luckily, the Gauls are Gallo-Romans now, Julius Caesar said so, so off they go to Greece to compete...Asterix #12 (1968) was ""Asterix and the Olympic Games"". Bit dry, I thought. Ending was disappointing. Just felt a bit out of style with how the Gauls go through with things. Getafix especially. Though it's nice to see Greece..."
3,"Great songs, Some flaws...","I've been a huge fan for all of my 37 years, and this is certainly an enjoyable and worthwhile compilation, BUT: How can edited versions of ""With a Little Luck"", & ""Venus & Mars/Rockshow"" be justified in this digital age? These great songs deserve better than to be ""fit in."" The edits are glaring. Of course, everyone has favorites that are sure to be left out, I won't add mine here, but two versions of ""No More Lonely Nights""? Also, while the studio take of ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" is one of the all time great love songs, sung and performed with simplistic beauty, the live ""Wings Over America"" version is the definitive track,a soaring rock classic, with perhaps Paul's best vocal ever, the band at peak form, and two truly awesome guitar solos. If this version had been included as well, you could see how it had evolved and grown from it's humble ""McCartney"" beginning. A multi-disc, (minimum 5 cd), box set from the legendary Sir Paul is eagerly awaited."
2,Recycled Melody's,"As an avid Beatles fan I usually couldn't wait for Paul's solo albums, but as the years go by and I listen to this music I have come to realize that it wasn't as good as it once sounded. The lyrics today sound silly (chilly Willy and his big band?) and dated. Linda's voice on the backgrounds proved that she should have stayed away from the recodring studio and the muscians are average at best. My guess, judging from the price decreases, is that most fans are staying away from this collection as well. Our tastes change and if you, I think, will find this collection very old, dated and poor"
4,Besides the track listing being incorrect..,"I like this 2 CD set. Sure, it's missing some rarities (like ""Give Ireland Back to The Irish"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb""). I bought this because [it was] advertised this with ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"" on it. Luckily, I still have my vinyl version of it!! Otherwise, it contains nearly every one of my favorites..""Juniors Farm"", ""Band on the Run"", ""My Love"", and ""Uncle Albert"". The cover art is 3-d, but otherwise the same as the ""non-collector"" version. The package does not contain a Wings pin as an earlier review stated. I think to have every Wings song on it, you probably need to have a box set. Otherwise, unless you don't care for Paul McCartney in the first place, you won't be unhappy with this compilation."
2,Clipped Wings,"Firstly, I want to say I am disappointed with this because I AS A FAN already have all these songs and was hoping for something a bit more, perhaps some of the Wings songs from the Cold Cuts LP I have remastered and but on a digital format?Secondly, a lot of these songs aren't even Wings songs! How much more disappointing can you get?I enjoyed the Special on TV but found it more a movie on Paul and Linda than anything really about Wings. Perhaps at some point something more akin to Beatles Anthology can be worked out in which we can get different cuts and takes from these songs, I have all these songs already here on these discs and didn't really need duplicates.Lastly, who arranged the order that these songs would go in? It seems to me to be a mess."
5,Score!,"Anything Sir Paul does is going to be a hit. This one is no exception. It's a brilliant car CD because you don't have to keep hunting for different CDs while you're driving to hear the best songs. Just pop this little baby in, and you've hours of great music all on one CD. Thanks Sir Paul, because you ""Don't Let Me Down""!"
3,Useful information for the McCartney completist,"If you already own the complete british remastered series of Paul McCartney's CDs (1993) which covers all the studio albums from McCartnet I (1970) to Flowers in the Dirt (1989). Then the only two new songs are: 1)the live version of Coming Up, not included as a bonus track on McCartney II (1980) and 2)the previously unreleased Bip Bop/Hey Diddle medley. That's all!You can also find slightly shorter versions (DJ Edits) of Junior's Farm, With a little luck, Venus and Mars/Rock Show, and Waterfalls. The rest of the material is already available, 38 of the 40 songs included in Wingspan, for example many people have complained of ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"" withdrawal, why? It is already available as a bonus track in ""Wings Wild Life"" British remastered edition 1993."
2,Horrible Remastering,"I love the music but the remastering has way way to much high end. Very much like tin. I a-b'd these with the remasterers from the UK and the Gold disc and this set is NOT GOOD. It's so strange that the CD was rematered by Geoff Emerick. Some are barely listenable and painful in headphones. At first I was wondering if I had a deffective one. Again, who could argue withe music but I can't listen to this one. I stick with the originals."
3,Only half a page of liner notes.,"One of the things that should be learnt from releasing collectors editions is that good liner notes are needed to give a history of the artist.""Wingspan"" has only half a page of liner notes which is very disappointing.There are plenty of photos but little in the way of information.It also would have been nice to have included songs like ""motor of love"" from the ""flowers in the dirt"" album.I know it was from a solo McCartney album,but so were songs like ""Maybe I'm Amazed,Junk"" and the solo single ""Another Day"" so that rule was bent a little anyway.This 2cd album is good value for money but one day I hope that we get a 2cd best of covering 1970-2000."
1,A little honesty here,"I hate to say it but it is pretty clear that the ""Our Customers' Advice"" for this CD are fakes. So are most of the reviews. On one hand you might have sympathy for a no-name artist trying to get some attention. On the other hand spamming Amazon with fake recommendations is not way to practice your art. Honestly the reviews I can live with, but I'm tired of seeing ""Shimmer"" listed on half the CDs on Amazon. Let's be honest, nobody has heard of it.You will have to decide for yourself whether this matters to you. For me it turns me off when they take it this far, and this guy has over-spammed his welcome with me."
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME...,"I was intrigued after seeing the numerous recommendations throughout Amazon... especially the ones trashing John Prine and Bruce Springsteen....I downloaded the samples and listened intently...wanting to like this guy and really trying to find the justification for such rave reviews...but after two days of listening to the 5 or so samples, all I can say is that his music is as transparent and full of fluff as the clearly 'fake' reviews which led me here.I'm very dissapointed.But I'll give him more respect than his crew gave other real and more deserving artists-- 2 stars, one for being able to sing and play guitar at the same time, and the other for almost nailing a poor attempt at shameless self promotion.And for the record, I advise the rest of you to stick to those artists who's sincerity is utmost, with their music, lyrics, and promotion."
1,"Not what I was hoping for, but close to what I feared","I was amused by the funny coincidence that this CD was ""suddenly"" recommended all over Amazon I decided to give the songs a listen. After all, feverish self-promotion could be a sign of overflowing artistic genius.Unfortunately this was not the case.The sample songs at least are not very good at all. This CD is an amateur effort with painfully abused melodies and lyrics that made me cringe. Perhaps some of the other songs are better, but based on the samples I could never imagine purchasing this CD. If I were you I would be certain to listen to the music samples before I bid farewell to my money."
1,Yogurt Powder - The truth,"Do not buy this!!! I love boba tea drinks. I've spent a small fortune buying them. To save money I realized it would be cheaper to find the ingredients and make it myself so I bought this powder. This is not yogurt powder! This is yogurt creamer, BIG DIFFERENCE! Tastes nothing like the drink I'm use to. The powder itself barely tastes sweet. Imagine buying creamer and adding it to black tea that is what you will get, gross. This creamer is not sweet nor does it taste like yogurt or at least the fake boba yogurt flavor that most Asians are familiar with. If you want to make real yogurt black tea or green tea boba drink then buy the syrup and not the powder. Trust me you will thank me!I think this powder is used for making yogurt milk tea or the yogurt ice blended drink but you have to add the yogurt syrup, sold separately."
2,Not a good historical read,"I discovered nothing from this read. This was writen after the author watched the movie Tora, Troa, Tora. Nothing new"
4,Personal approach to Pearl Harbor,"Tells the ""stories"" of Pearl Harbor through the eyes of many participants, great and small. A very enjoyable book to read."
5,"This Book Puts You At Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941","This was the first non-kids book I ever read. That was back in the 3rd Grade. And years later I still look at this book as one of my favorites.Walter Lord does not break any new ground in this classic but older story of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But what he does do is give you a perfect description of what happened and how it happened.Walter Lord is one of those historians that puts you there. And thats what he does in this book. You are there as the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.I highly recommend this book."
4,Day of Infamy,"Walter Lord's ""Day of Infamy"" should be read by every American each year on December seventh. This is a piece of history that must never be forgotten. It is the story of the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and was probably the basis for the original movie, ""Tora, Tora, Tora.""The companion book by the same author is ""Incredible Victory,"" the story of the battle of Midway, an important turning point in the war."
4,Great history,"Well researched and written work on the attack on Pearl Harbor. The minute details describing the events before, during and after paint a vivid picture of one of American histories most recognizable and important events. While bias is present, it does not diminish from the points made or the argument presented."
3,Somewhat tedious,"Found the early chapters of the book very interesting, especially the discussion on who fired the ""first shot"". The later chapters which depicted individuals personal accounting of the attack did get repetious and a little too graphic."
5,"Walter Lord, Author for the Little Guy","In all books where possible Walter Lord goes to interview those affected by events not just those who author the events.In ""Day of Infamy"" and ""Incredible Victory"" Lord gets the story of seamen and privates as well as admirals and generals.""A Night To Remember"" was written at a time when many of the Titanic survivors were still alive. Again, Lord got the stories of crew, steerage passengers as well as ship's officers and promenade deck passengers.""A Time To Stand"" was very revealing to this native Texan. Lord travelled to Mexico City to research Mexican records from the time of the Alamo. He even photographed the actual flag that flew over the Alamo. You will be surprised at what flag it was. Lord also busted the myth that all Texans died in the siege."
3,An old sounding Cenerentola but otherwise not bad,"I haven't heard this recording since the seventies and I remember that I like it then. Now, hearing it on CD 30 years later I am a little more critical. Simionato made this recording past her vocal prime and her voice sounds hollow and a little raspy but her characterization is good. Benelli is an adequate prince but kudos really go to Bruscantini as Dandini and Montarsolo as Don Magnifico. There are some cuts in the recitative and standard cuts in the repeated sections. Fabritiis' conducting is workmanlike. The CD packaging is very nice and folds out however, the libretto is in italian and french since this is a french-decca pressing."
1,VERY SORRY I ORDERED,"Very misleading. Says will ship in 1 or 2 days and then its nothing but excuse after excuse. I ordered my print on November 18th and here it is December 15th and still nothing but excuses. First their selling page stated that it would ship by November 23rd and then they said December 5th and then they said December 9th and now they tell me its mailed and that they will email me a tracking #, but of course they don't! BE AWARE!!!!!!!"
4,A Taste Of The Future,"This ep is excellent though a bit uneven sounding. ""Pinned Down"" has a certain spirit that has been lacking in Sioux's last releases, quite the treat. ""Guillotine"" shows Siouxsie with the venom in her voice that most defininitely has been absent or should we say dormant for the past few years while ""Thank You"" and ""Slipping Away"" show the Creatures knack for the unexpected."
4,Si! Si! Si!,"I bought this album on a whim 7 years ago. It was my first introduction to the sedutiveness of Marina Lima's voice! Powerful stuff! Graceful, melodic, the music carries you away with moving lyric and sultry guitar and electronica work. A must for any collection!"
3,Good for any Christian interested in our roots,"This book is a helpful resource for anyone interested in how the Jewish world views theology. In particular, I found it intriguing to hear Kohler's descriptions of the Jewish faith as creedless, while Gentile Christianity followed the more typical Gentile philosophical way of building creeds. Even today we see a much more creedally-minded focus in Western Christianity than the Eastern branches, and reminds us that a good portion of the divisions among Christians are self-imposed due to cultural variation."
4,Treading lightly,"In my younger days, I was very much into E.F.Schumacher. I didn't have much stuff of my own then, and didn't expect to. Since then, I've accumulated more. Now I have too much clutter. I won't do without Christian faith, family, friends, but the rest is encumbering. There are many good precepts in this book, some from faiths I don't share. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I can't find it. Perhaps I loaned it, but no one will admit to borrowing it. Now I wish I could return it to the pile of books beside my bed."
3,Worth the money IF it's on clearance...but don't pay retail.,"I found this camera on clearance for $49 at WalMart, and I bought it for my daughter. No, it's not perfect, but I think it's an excellent camera for $49! Would I suggest paying full list price? No. As other reviews said, the flash has issues. But if you can buy this item for under $50, I say go for it! My daughter loved it!"
4,"For what I Paid, It was a good deal.","Only reason I got this camera really was because of its great rechargeable lithium polymer battery. No more buying batteries for my camera, and it has longer battery life. Also, I only paid 49.99 for this camera at wal-mart."
1,Its not even good enuf for an entry level camera,"I paid $140 online, cudnt get the MP3 to work, the photos outside wer OK didnt try any inside, I got it for my wife but sent it back right away an got her a full featured 4 MP Kodak for $90"
4,"Pretty good rhetorical guide, though a bit skimpy on lit.","I actually use this book to teach college students how to write, research, edit, and cite, so I have picked up a great deal of info just from absorbing it. The book is laid out in chapters that progress from a basic context for writing, to prewriting strategies, to drafting and revision methods, to analysis of literature, and finally to researching and citing sources. The book covers MLA and APA formats. It also features a handbook section in case students wish to work independently on improving certain problem areas in their writing. There are very good explanations of all the rhetorical patterns.The one area that seems skimpy to me is the one on literary analysis. The book does not feature very many stories or poems either, so the teacher must supplement it. This is disappointing, since the chapter on argumentation is pretty decent."
4,Very Happy,I was very happy with the speedy shipment and the condition of the product. will buy again
3,I was okay,"It had a nice plot, though it was boring at first and was a bit of a difficult read. I also wasn't dying to read the second one, but over all I liked it."
5,Unforgettably enchanting ...,"""The Golden Compass,"" along with ""The Subtle Knife,"" is one of the best books I've ever read. While you would pull this gem out of a children's books section, it's certainly a gaurunteed delight for all ages."
5,This is the best book I've ever read!,"I have to say that when I picked up The Golden Compass, I just figured it would be another run-of-the-mill fantasy with dragons, princesses, and the like. However, I had to read a fantasy for a report, so I chose this book. I'm sure glad I did!Lyra and Pantalaimon, a pubescent girl and her dmon (the embodiment of a person's soul), were totally captivating. I just couldn't put the book down! I'd stay up until 1 A.M. just to read ""one more chapter."" The excitement and mystery were there from page 1.Philip Pullman has written a wonderful book, probably his best yet. I have gone on to read some of the Sally Lockhart books because of how good this book was. Pullman leaves readers wanting more at the end. I'm about to read The Subtle Knife, and I can't wait until I get it!"
5,One of those books you just cannot and will not put down...,"My Mum brought this book home one day and I thought ""Ohh.. Great! Another boring book to read!"". That night, I started to read it and found I could not put it down and stayed up 'till 11:30 p.m. reading. Being such a hard book to put down, I finished it in a few days and found it VERY interesting, with Lyra sneaking around Jordan College <in the beginning>, leading the life of a gyptian <around the middle>, and stumbling through the Arctic <near the end>. Do not be fooled by the book's length, it is a fantastic book and you will not be able to put down. A superb and adventurous book, I wish there were more books like this one. Phillip Pullman is quite talented and I cannot wait for his second book in this series. Enjoy! I know I did!"
5,A Review of the Golden Compass,"I have recently read Phillip Pullman's The Golden Compass. For myself I found it was a very good book. I enjoy reading Fiction or Science Fiction books, but if you are not interested in these types I wouldn't recommend this book. Phillip Pullman used his imagination very well to create this book and it is part of what makes this book so interesting. I hate reading books that have parts where there is no action going on and it gets really boring. The Golden Compass is packed with exiting events and you are never just reading stuff, there is always external or internal conflict going on. Parts of the book are really suspenseful and you want to read on, and you can never tell what is going to happen next because Phillip Pullman writes things that you would never expect to happen, or even think of. This is a great book, and I really recommend you read it, I am sure you will enjoy it thoroughly."
4,The Golden Compass: Can't go wrong,"The Novel the Golden Compass by Philip Pullman is a great book for teens because it is challenging to read, but not incredibly difficult. When I first began to read it, I was confused by some dialogue, but soon became accustomed to the confusing phrases. Its a great book that I would highly recommend for older and younger readers alike."
5,"I have a LOT of books, and this one is the mantle piece!","The Golden Compass is by far one of the best books I have ever had the good fortune to ever read! It creats a shimmering of world shapeshifting deamons, talking polar bears, and wonderfully spoken characters all in the glow of the Northern Lights."
1,bbboooorrrrrrrriiiiinnnngggggg,"this book is really boring. it's about some weirdo's who kidnap kids in england, and about a girl and a polar bear in the north pole, where somehow, aurora borealis (i didn't spell that right) just transformed in to an alter dimension thingy. This book has about 30 pages of action, and is really to long. This was such a let down, because after reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which i strongly suggest buying, this book was a joke. Poor writting, combined with a boring story."
1,"totally, utterly awful","I have never read a more poorly written book in my life. I'm an adult, but I like reading books for young adults. This book is very poorly plotted, is very uninvolving, and is generally written very sloppily. I had to give up 75 pages from the end, because it was so bogus. This author could not write a credible action sequence to save his life. The hero of the story does very little on her own behalf, takes very little initiative, very few risks. She just rides along like a good little princess. This book is also full of happy little patronising expository comments and lectures. It's like an episode of The Magic Schoolbus from PBS. This book is a drag anyway you slice it. If you want a good children's story adventure, read Robin Jarvis. You can order Jarvis's books from amazon.co.uk."
5,CD - Golden compass,Good book. Love to listen to these on trips. I don't get all of the hype. I was born and raised Catholic. It's a book!! Fiction! I hope to get the rest of the books soon.
1,I'm baffled that people enjoy this series,"It's surprising that readers compare this series to Harry Potter. I reached the end out of sheer determination to ignore the horrendous, blunt writing style of Philip Pullman, his ridiculous characters, and contrived story. Before you buy this, open the book and read a page ... that is all I need to say. It doesn't get any better -- every page is terrible."
1,The mindless ranting of a lunatic!,"After reading all the 5-star reviews, I felt I had to give this book a try. What a disappointment! The writer seems utterly uninspired and untalented. The story drags on and on, getting nowhere. It is full of totally irelevant gimmicks like the 'daemons'. The central character is an utter twit, like all the other shallow characters. This is such mindless drivel, that I think I'm going to burn the book!"
1,I love this book!!!!!!!! (EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I HATE IT...) ^_^,"1. I do not like it, at all.2. I don't like it because it has unessesary grammar.3. It bored be so much, I could not continue.4. The more I read it, I wanted to stop!5. My advice: Please do not waste your money on it. You will regret wasting your money. (Believe me. I usually love big fantasy books like this, but this one isn't like that. ^_^)"
1,The Worst Book I Have EVER Read,"Like the title of my review says, this is absolutely, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. The plot is inane, the characters are irritating and stupid, and the setting is utterly ridiculous. The concept of daemons and the even sillier concept of bears having armor just makes me want to cry. ..."
5,Amazing,The Golden Compass in an amazing and thought-provoking first installment to an amazing and thought-provoking trilogy. I have read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife(which is equally as great) and I am a few chapters away from fininshing The Amber Spyglass(which so far is incredible) I am looking forward to Lyra's Oxford and The Book Of Dust.
3,good book bad ending,"When I was told to read the Golden Compass for a school assignment I went home and skimmed through the book like I always do. Then as I got through the Book I started to love it. I couldnt put the book down. I enjoy reading and I love fantasy. The book was entriging and I Finished it in a week. When I got to the end however, I was dissapointed at the fact that questions i had went unsolved. I think there are a few possibilities why this books ending was not written well to the degree of the rest of the book. -The author wants you to read the next book(which i will, in all probability not do, because of my temper of the fist book) -The author is not a very strong writer when it comes to concluding. -The author was tired and so he made the ending sloppy.So basicly i enjoyed the book and would recomend it to a person who doesnt need all the strings tied up at the end."
3,hhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmm,"I actually haven't finsished the book yet, but cause of all da uda reveiws, use guys had ritten, i guess its an ok book. and hey! i had a test on it and i got a B+, even thou i still havnt finishshed it yet. Luv use alls. Caio, caio! Luv Aphrodite!"
2,Disappointed,"I tend to be skeptical when it comes to anything that is surrounded by a lot of hype and critical acclaim so as not to form expectations that may easily be disappointed. But how could I not give this book a chance when it has been so highly recognized and awarded, called a classic and compared to Tolkein and Lewis? These comparisons could not be further from the truth. This book is nowhere near the level of writing of these two celebrated authors. Give credit where credit is due.The Golden Compass is an interesting story, though the writing is a little childish for adult readers and the content a little mature for children. But let's compare apples to apples here. This is not a classic, and there is little reason Pullman should be mentioned in the same sentence as Tolkein or Lewis.I pity those reviewers who claim this is the best book they've ever read. It makes me wonder what they have been reading."
3,A Slow Starter,"Pullman's The Golden Compass starts off slow. The first part introduces the reader to daemons, an extension of humans. The heroine, Lyra is an orphan given free reign to roam Oxford and the streets and docks of the city. She has the barest of an education although she lives in a College. The story gathers steam when the children of England start disappearing. The adventure begins at this point. We meet a variety of characters who range from Lords, Scholars to gyptian and witches. Read the book if you plan to read the series. On its own it may be found lacking."
5,A great read for young adults.,"This book is intelligent, well written and organized, and has loveable characters. It may be a bit too much for anyone under 10, but from 10 to 14, this is great reading.True, it is rather dark and dreary, but it's about time. I always considered an ability to enjoy sadness a sign of genius. One can't live in the happy fairy tales forever.This is a great read for fans of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, and fans of this series should check Martin out as well. The two are different yet alike, difficult to explain but easy to appreciate.The final judgment? Intelligence and imagination collide to create the most original allegorical fantasy since Narnia."
5,Breathtaking,"An astoundingly good light-fantasy book. The author starts out from nothing but a simple scene of a girl doing a bit of childish mischief, and masterfully weaves everything from there into a tale so gripping, so heart-wrenching and so above anything I really expected that it left me looking in shock at the pages as I read.If you're looking for a comparison as to the style of the story, it resembles most closely the stories of Narnia, only a LOT darker, and WAY over the top on the action, violence and twists.On the other hand, Pullman pulls no punches with what may be his own personal opinion of religion OR may be simply the world he envisioned; either way, if you are religious you are sure to be offended, so tread cautiously. But if you are more open-minded, not squeamish about make-believe morality systems, and looking for a brilliant story with a brilliant protagonist, look no further. I go into the next two books with very high expectations."
3,Not bad,"I just finished this book a few minutes ago, so it's fresh in mind. I liked it, but am surprised at the ebullient reception it has apparently garnered. There are so many ideas here that a hundred more pages seem in order. The ending seemed rushed, as though the author was just glad to end it.Cool: The armored bears. Iorek Byrnison was just a real gem of a character, as placid and stolid as the arctic wastes of his home. Check out the last paragraph of chapter 10.Uncool: Lyra totally pulls the wool over the bear king, a character who throughout the book is described as clever and capable. The explanation that ""a bear who wants to be a human can be easily fooled"" is a little thin.I could go on with pros and cons, but the bottom line is:All in all, a good read."
5,Takes one away to another world as the best books do!,I read this book to my son who is 9 years old. Neither of us could wait for reading time every evening. The book is absorbing and the characters are alive for us. I don't know whether me or my son liked this book most. We both loved it! We are now reading The Subtle Knife and enjoying that too. I have purchased The Golden Compass for several other children and sing its' praises to all who love quality children's literature.
5,Anyone who wasn't captivated must have missed something!!!!!,"I have never been so impressed with a book in my life. Phillip Pullman draws you in with a wonderfully complex plot and amazing charactors. Lyra's world is captivating, the charactors are constantly changing, and the dangers are constantly becoming worse. Lyra herself is a wonderfly fiesty charactor, completed by her more subdued spirit -being Paintalaimon. The world lyra lives in is cleverly crafted, a mixture of our own and something completely different. The Golden Compas is a book that makes you think and wonder, and it leaves you waiting for more at the end. It is in a class by itself. Read the Subtle Knife as well."
5,Completly wonderful. . . couldn't put it down!,"The book was very interesting. It is one of those books that once you start reading you can not put down. You can read it over and over again and notice something new each time. I am a frequent fantasy reader and I know what to look for. This book has it all! Fantasy rich in detail, mystery of the sort that keeps tugging at your mind; urging you to continue reading. Intrigue, betrayel, friendship, love, magic, and a setting that keeps changing with every turn of the page. A good book doesn't need any pictures because the words themselves can form the pictures in your mind, this book does that with an intesity that most books do not have. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and books that open your mind to amazing possibilities and whole new worlds."
5,"Magical, happy, and sad at the same time!",This book was so wonderful! I was looking everywher for the second book! I wish it had never ended.
4,The Golden Compass,This book was so good. If you start reading it you will probably find it boring in the beginning but it gets much better. I may have given this book 4 stars but that is only because of the beginning other wise I would give it 5 stars. This book takes place in some other kind of world. Everyone has some kind of mysterious companion called a daemon. You never really learn too much about them in this book but all you find out is that everyone has one and they can change into any animal they want until you have grown up. Their final shape represents you and your personality. When I first found this out I was intrigued and couldn't stop reading. You have to read this book because you find out some pretty mysterious things in the end.
4,Inspired writing and strong ideas,"It is truly unfortunate when an adult returns to one of his favorite books from childhood and finds it utterly unreadable. Far better to read a fresh children's book, as an adult, and find it mature, complex and interesting. I looked into the books following the release of the excellent trailer for the movie which comes out this November. It is encouraging to see that young readers are being exposed to critical thought, theology and quantum physics at such a young age. I would have truly loved this book had I read it upon its publication, but even now I find the book captivating. The characterizations of Asriel and Coulter will need to be developed a little more fully in the subsequent two-thirds of the trilogy but I'm very excited to see where it takes me. Also, good for the youngsters to have some Greek to think about (the alethiometer, as well as daemons). I've already started the second book, which takes place in our universe, at least at the beginning."
5,The Golden Compass is an absolutely wonderful book.,"The Golden Compass is one of the best books I've read in my lifetime. It's fabulous, it's wonderful, it's perfect.I am about to begin reading the sequel, The Subtle Knife, and I have a feeling it's going to be great too. I have never read a book as entertaining and as exciting as The Golden Compass."
4,A Book to Remember,"This is a wonderful and insiring book. I could not put it down. I probably finished it in two to three days becuase I had to find out what happened next. The book is filled with beauty, adventure, heartbreak, and furry. I loved every minute of it! From the surprise to almost crying in fear and frustration. I hope that the next book THE SUBTLE KNIFE is just as adnveturouse and beautiful as the last."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is wonderful! It's one of my all-time favorites. This is the kind of book that you can't wait to read. Once you've started it you can't put it down. You'll read it at lunch, on your coffee breaks and any time you have a free second. The plot is superb, the characters wonderful, and the atmosphere perfect. You know how in some stories there are threads flowing all through them, then at the end they get all tied together? This is one of those stories."
5,"Totally, completely and incredibly amazing!","This was an amazing book! I highly recommend it for readers of all ages. The only thing I found vaguely annoying, and slightly disconcerting, was the way the author occasionally, and without a seeming pattern, sometimes switched voices. I felt that this technique detracted more from the story than it contributed. Otherwise, it was a well-crafted, well-told story, and Lyra is an extremely interesting character. I was intrigued by the idea of the human-daemon bond, and I'm looking forward to learning more about its connection to Dust and to the science and psychology of that world and ours.I'm glad to see that the book is out in paperback, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the others. Keep it up, Mr. Pullman!"
4,Good,"This book and the Harry Potter books are pretty similer. On both of them, the main charecter doesn't have any parentys, it invloves magic, ect. This book is sort of good. Pros: well writen, gripping story, rereadable. Cons: Teidious at some parts, many religious overtones. Overall this book is worth the money"
3,this book doesn't deserve the attention it's been getting,"I find that this is a good story only for those people who have not used their imaginations in a long, long, time and therefore can not take a very imaginative story just yet. The story is only okay, and as far as fantasy goes, it's not great- I'll take Harry Potter anyday. At several points the story gets very boring."
3,For very young children,"This is not a story for anyone with a bit of maturity. I suppose it's good for children but it's not even adecuate for teenagers. The character development is too poor(there isn't really one for most characters)and the story does not unfold in any logical way; that is to say there are a lot of contradictions (take for example all that bussines with bears than can't be tricket or the fact that, if you really think about it, what Lyra should be reading on the aletheometer is never what she reads. If she would have used it properly she could know the outcome of every meeting she has).To make it short: it lacks the complexity and devolopment that is needed to entretain adults or adults-to-be."
3,FYI,"""Northern Lights"" (British title) is published in the United States as ""The Golden Compass"" and is the first volume in Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy."
5,I can't believe they're turning this into a movie...,"Fortunately, the man doing the directing, is the one who did The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But it's still an awsome book. It's one of those books that you have to read at least twice, and then read the other two, and then go back and read them all again."
5,Good price,This was a very good price for a book on CD. I will probably buy more books on CD now that I know how easy it is.
3,Classic fantasy,"His Dark Materials are justifiably famous, and a must-read for any well-rounded fantasy fan. The world-building and characters are very well developed, and I enjoyed the story. It did sometimes feel a little slow, though very well written. All that said, I didn't love it as much as I wanted to. The slower pacing and less-than-likable protagonist made the journey sometimes a little dry."
2,I just didn't get it.,"The be perfectly honest, this book gave me a headache. There were seemignly endless pages waiting for the story to begin, and rapid fire introduction of new characters that my sleep deprived brain couldn't handle. I didn't like the main charecter, I couln't relate to her, and a lot of the time I wanted to smack her around. Nothing happened in the first three chapters of the book the get things rolling in a coherent fashion. You don't spend enough time with alot of the charecters to get to like them. The only reason that I read the book at all is because a friend pestered me into it. Now of course the other two are sitting on her shelf waiting for me. I'm not looking forward to it."
5,THE REVIEW,This book was amazing and always kept you hanging. Pullman has really outdone hisself this time. I give this book 5 stars and call it the greatest book I ever read.
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!,"I think this is one of the best books I've read.It may have been a little incomplete,but nevertheless it was still a great book!"
5,This is an awesome book!!!!!!,"This book was so good!!!!!!!!! I recomend it to anyone, there is such a sense of magic in it and mystery! I cried at the end and was raving a bout it for months after! I can't wait to read the second one! this is a great book! Read it!"
5,A Great Book,"Althogh I was a little confused in the beginning about daemons and everything, the book was really good. Lyra is a good character and all of the odd things that Philip Pullman has created make the story even better."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!,"This book is the best I've EVER read. If you read it, you will definately want to finish the series. The book has so many cliff-hangers that you will never want to stop reading it. The ending even makes you want to move on to the next book (The Subtle Knife) as though it is just another chapter! I can assure you that you will enjoy this book about Lyra and her magical life. You'll probably want a daeman and the many other cool things that Lyra has. It'll take you a little while to get into the book, but you will love it after the first 30 or so pages. Don't give up after a few pages. The rest of the series is just as good. The three books in the series are The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spy Glass. Buy the His Dark Materials books today!"
5,The plot wickedly twists and turns in a most exciting way.,"Lyra and the number of other characters in the book really made the story come alive. The plot wickedly twisted and turned but was not so confusing as say ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" series. I thought it was cool that you suspected the wrong people until to late. I also thought it was cool that they don't describe in great detail any super gory deaths. It was mostly clean good action."
5,the best book in the world!,"This was the best book I ever read!I love the d'mons.When I read this book I craved to have my own.It was an action packed book.Lyra ,the heroin goes to save her friend and befriends a polarbear.I truly incourage you to read this book!"
5,"Captivating, Exciting, WONDERFUL!","Being that I am an avid Harry Potter fan, I thouroughly enjoyed this book. If you're interested in reading fantasies, this book is for you. It's a nail biter you won't want to put down. I would include more in this review, but I don't want to give any part of the book away."
3,Quite good.,"The Golden Compass is a very enjoyable read with engaging characters, an interesting alternate world, and some fascinating ideas. I'm not ashamed to admit that I wept through a couple of scenes--Pullman writes well and unflinchingly without mincing details or prettying things up, and the result is poignant and beautiful writing that rings true in the mind of the reader.That said, this wonderfully-written book still feels somehow incomplete, with too many things begun and too few resolved. It begins rather than ends, making it feel like Part 1 rather than Book 1. Perhaps my opinion will change once I acquire the other two books, as The Golden Compass is evidently a book that needs to be taken as part of a whole. In this aspect it's more comparable to the Amber series by Roger Zelazny than to, say, the Harry Potter books."
4,This is a great book!,"I've read almost a 30% of it, great story. I'm enjoying it a lot. Can't wait to finish it! !"
5,The Golden Compass,The Golden Compass could be recommended to all children older than 10. I choose this rating because it was a real adventure. This was the best book ever.
5,Has Everything A Great Story Should Have,"The Golden Compass is the beginning of a great series - but also a story of it's own. Enlisting science, mysticism, history, geography, and great themes of heroism, determination, willpower, tragedy and destiny - this book will hook you and keep you interested. Although the content seems a bit older than it's central character, Lyra - she's still up to the challenges presented to her. This series is a great way to escape into a different world. The audio versions of this book are performed brilliantly - and are a joy to listen to. Looking forward to the movie this year: if anything like the book - it'll be a smash hit."
3,"Wonderful Plot, but too complicated for me!","I have read this book 3 or 4 times, and I definitely appreciate how creative this book is. However, as hard as I try, I am still left in the dark about many parts of this book. I still don't really understand the concept of dust. It would have been helpful to have parts of the story told through the eyes of charachters who understood what Lyra was going through (if any of them really ever did). It is, however a great book for those who have the competency to handle complex storylines. I would suggest that anyone interested enough to read this review will try the book out for themself."
4,It provokes much thought and interest.,This is a great fantasy novel that gets you thinking and plays with your imagination. I'm sure you will enjoy it greatly.
5,Pullman at his finest!,"The Golden Compass- best book ever! Just the way it's written, with politics, religon, and emotion combined in one, The Golden Compass definatley reaches the top of my list of superb books. Pullman writes about a child, Lyra Silvertongue, who goes from England to the North Pole, on an adventure that let's her see who she really is. Lyra journeys to the North to give her father an alethiometer, a truth measurer, only to find a-whole-nother adventure that's out of this world. If written any simpler, The Golden Compass would've ended up being an absurd book, but it's written so earnestly, that anyone can find it intriguing."
5,The most suspensful book I ever read!,"This book gave me the chills! I could not put it down. I am 13 years old an books like this amaze me. I read lots and have since grade 4. This book has been for sure one of the top three books I have ever read! Now that is a great complement considering that I have read all the books from the Dragon Riders of Pern series, many series from the author Mercedes Lackey and these are no small books. The character of Lera, pulls you right into the story and tends to, like to hold on to you. The suspence in some parts leaves you feeling like you are hanging over a cliff and your heart seems to skip a beat!"
5,One of the Best stories ever written!!!,"Extrodinary....Breathtaking....Awe-inspiring....words cannot begin to describe this rousing, powerfull, illustrious, page-turning adventure!! Philip Pullman's world is a totally involved fantasy with drama and vivid emotions! The characters immediately become real and you are suddently surrounded by danger, magic, adventure, courage, friendship, and betrayal. This book is for anyone who enjoys an excelent fantasy adventure and loves a story you just can't put down!"
5,The Golden Compass is a Golden Book!!,"From the very beginning Philip Pullman pulls you right into the story. Though this book can be confusing for younger readers it is a great one for older children. How he thinks of all this is unimaginable, it seems that so much time and effort and creativity went into it! A must read book and should be on every child's shelf!"
5,A fabulous book in an enthralling series!!!,"This is a wonderful book, and when I finished, all my friends wanted to borrow it (and even my teachers)!! I loved this book. It was imaginative, fun, beautiful, heartbreaking, and elaborate. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I don't believe I could do it justice by writing a summary of it, so I'll leave it to you. Read this book, then sigh with delight, then read the next one, then be depressed because he just can't throw these out fast enough. Read it, I know you'll like it. ~Sunn"
5,Not for religious people,"Lyra lives a happy life at Jordan college, having mud wars with her friends and rival colleges, running on the roof tops, and playing with her demon. Demon? every person in her world has one, it can change shapes until you reach puberty, then it fixes its form on your personality. She was happy until the Gobblers came to town. No one knows who or what they are, but they take children. When Lyra's best friend gets taken away she starts on a journy to find him. I would not suggest this book to religous people, as God and Angels are explained scientificaly. For anyone else it is a must read. If you read this book you have to read the other 2 books in the trilogy."
4,It's been two days and I'm still thinking about the ending.,"... The first 200 pages things seemed kind of slow and being a boy I wasn't so much into the tomboy character of Lra. There's a lot of time spent on describing the suroundings that I think can be boring. ... But I will say that when Golden picks up, you can't put it down. And the ending of this book is brilliant. It leaves you with such wonder and excitment that you'll want to dive right into the next book."
1,bbbbbbboooooooorrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnnnggggggggg,"this is just a boring book. I'm sorry, but after reading epics such as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, this is a big let down. Not packed with enough adventure, and poorly written is how i describe this book. If you like story's about wierd people who abduct kids in england, and travel to the north pole with a polar bear, than this is the book for you, but if you enjoy action packed, or well written novels that are not boring, then DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I don't know why several people like this book, but because i've read almost every good fantasy/adventure book out there, i can say fairly that this is a bad book"
1,Pullman didn't have to write such a stupid book,This book had cuss words that could have easily been avoided as well as many other inappropriate things..don't waste your time on this book. The even altered the BIBLE in this book. STEP AWAY
1,Feminist Pederasty,"Pullman's books parallel the murky culturally drained environment of contemporary England whose assorted committees of public decency expurgate classic books because of ""insensitivity"". Like Ursula K. Leguin his purpose is merely political emetic as New Age mumbo jumbo. The polar bear reminded me of the Coke commercials. Silly."
3,The Golden Compass: to read or not to read,"Recently I read the Golden compass and I must say i was very dissapointed. I had heard from other people that this was an excellent and that everyone should read it. It was one of the slowest, most confusing books i have ever read. if you must read this book i suggest skipping the first 50 pages. good luck"
2,"It's Not the Ideas, It's the Writing","For me, when reading fiction, I care far less about the content of the writer's message than with how effectively in graceful, subtle writing that message is conveyed. Pullman fails on that count -- he is a derivative bludgeon rather than a knife. As one small example, the Texan balloon pilot who plays a minor role is in one scene nothing more than a copy of Han Solo in Star Wars. I approached The Golden Compass ready to be plunged into an epic adventure; I finished it uninterested in what happens to any of the characters. And as for ever thinking about going on to the rest of the trilogy, forget it.I realize this is both harsh and a very minority view, but wanted to warn prospective readers/buyers who may be on the fence about The Dark Materials, having heard the decade-long buzz, that sometimes, for some people buzz is simply wrong."
2,Not for Kids,"I read the entire series. I bought the first book but would not have paid to read the rest. Instead, I found them at the library. The series describes two main characters who come together to save the world. Mr. Pullman surely must be an atheist or at the very least, a humanist. The book is full of allusions which are not very easily understood. This is the kind of series where characters DO die and not come back. There is not always a happy ending as you would expect for kids' books. The last book of the series has a professor renouncing her Roman Catholic religion because of its oppression of the pleasures of the flesh. We eventually see ""god"" being overthrown with man being left to rule his own world. Not recommended for children and barely recommended for adults."
5,The Golden Compass,"The Golden Compass is probably one of the best books that I have ever listened to. I am listening to it on a CD, and what's so unique about it is that there isn't one narrator. There is a cast of people that play different voices in the book. The Golden Compass is a story about Lyra, niece of Lord Asreal. Lyra is troubled because her uncle is always having adventures in the North. Lyra badly wants to go there with Lord Asreal, but she is still too young. Read the book to discover the Aurora Borealis, Dust, and dimensions beyond our own."
5,An Amazing Book,"The Golden Compass, by Philip Pullman, is the first book of an amazing trilogy. The main character is a young girl named Lyra with a craving for adventure living at a college in Oxford, England. She and her daemon, a shape-shifting animal that a human is bound to for life with, hid in a closet in a restricted room to women where she learned about Dust, a mysterious substance that can only be seen with a special spyglass. Immediately Lyra was fascinated by everything she heard about in the room not knowing what she was in for. Later she is presented an alethiometer, meaning a truth measure. Lyra has to learn to read the alethiometer to benifit her allies and the children they are seaking to rescue from the"
4,The Golden Compass,"The Golden Compass is a riveting book. It has many twists and turns. Lyra, an orphan girl, lives in a college in England. Her friend Roger, the kitchen boy, goes missing one night and Lyra goes on a quest with her deamon, Pantalaimon. A daemon is a creature that shares a soul with their human. It can change into many animal forms. Her quest takes her to every end of the earth in search of her destiny. In the end, Lyra finds out that her destiny will be fulfilled in a different way than she expected. This book is creative and mysterious at times. This story is very well written. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in reading a fantasy with a hint of reality."
5,Not just for fantasy fans!,"I read very little fantasy, but so many of my gifted 6th grade students were reading Pullman that I had to take the plunge and order the Dark Materials.I quickly become engrossed in the story of Lyra and her quest to find Roger and return the Golden Compass to her uncle Lord Asriel. One night I stayed awake, not reading, but contemplating the implications of the relationships between the humans of the book and their daemon familiars. (After a while, you begin to feel lonely without one!)While I can understand the sensitivity of some fundamentalist Christians to the depiction of the Church in the book, the love and steadfast values shown by Lyra, her daemon Pantalaimon, Iorek the armored bear, John Faa, and others make this a thoughtful fantasy for young adults.Loved the bears, the skewed Oxford, Lyra's street slang, the evil golden monkey, and Ma Costa. Now on to the next in the trilogy!"
2,Boring...,"Yet another linear, mediocre fantasy book. Add it to the others of its kind from David Eddings and the like. Definitely not in the same league as Tolkien, C.S.Lewis or a few others. The plot is like a Sydney Sheldon novel for ""kids"". The Church is the evil empire (!) in a paralell universe, and also, as we find out in later books, in our world. The plot moves only in one direction, and you can identify each of the author's afterthoughts as he tries to make it coherent. Is he really trying to sell us his subversive view of christianity as the equivalent of evil and ignorance ? If so, he fails miserably in my view. The characters are blatantly one-dimensional, you close the book and forget their names, and will not feel endeared to any of them. They are not lovable, they are just there, like the zombies and specters in his books, devoid of any life of their own. My strong recommendation: rather than reading this stuff pick your old copy of The Lord of the Rings and read it again..."
4,I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book,"I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book, even though it's supposed to be part of a children's series.The story moves at a fast pace and there are quite a few darker element to this story, so I would probably recommend it for grades 6 and up. The Golden Compass which is the first of 3 books known as Phillip Pullmans ""his dark Materials"" is also supposed to be released as a movie this year. Can't wait to see how they capture it on screen.The story revolves around Lyra Belacqua who ends up on a dark adventure trying to find her friend Roger who was kidnapped by The Gobblers. She meets many interesting people on her journey, including witches and armoured bears. The story takes part in a world very similar to ours, except in Lyra's world every human being has a daemon, which is essentially their soul in animal form.I can't wait to see where the journey leads us in ""The Subtle Knife""."
2,Fine if you are under 18...,"What can I say: the characters were flat and the story linear. There was just no depth to it, and after all the hype I was very disappointed."
2,Took me forever to read...,"Ok. First of all. This book took me two weeks to read, which is a ridiculously long time for me. I've been known to finish a couple of books in a day.The reason it took me so long was that I was lost from the very beginning. There was just way to many characters and questions introduced in the first few chaptes and I couldn't seem to catch up. I'm not sure if this was Pullman's writing style (lots of dialogue, not many descriptions) or my fragmented reading style - but I just couldn't get into the story.I wasn't a huge fan of the characters. I liked the setting and thought the premise was original... but I wasn't blown away.Yes, I will read it again because I think it will read better the second time.Yes, I will read the next book.But overall - I probably wouldn't have even finished it if I hadn't of purchased it."
5,(......),"In case you were wondering, i am at a lack of words.. this is one of the best books I have read in my entire life, as short as it may be at 17. I read a LOT of books, and I don't think any books have shown me such an involving and MOVING story as this book did.I know it sounds hackneyed and oversaid, but I have read the first two, and am currently finishing the third, I have to say the biggest (and quite possibly the ONLY) problem with this book is the fact that books can only be so long, and they do, eventually, end. the end of these books is like losing a loved pet or friend, you really enjoyed their presence, and they brought you joy and happiness when they were around, but now they are gone, and it's over. oh well, I'll just read it again :)"
5,I loved it!,"This book is the kind of book that I normally read, and I loved it. But you shouldn't just get the opinion from an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader, because this is a book anyone would love. I gave it to my friend to read and she is usually someone who will only read books that are historical fiction, but she loved it! If you want a book that's good enough to read over and over again, this would be the one!"
3,An entertaing read,"A good book, both for adults and children. Not one of my favorites, however, it was good enough that I bought the other 2 books in the series. Well written, interesting."
5,A compelling book on the border between fiction and fantasy,"A book that, from the first page, became one of my favourites. The tale of Lyra, a young girl from a Oxford England in a time parallel to ours, and her quest to find her father and about the experimentation on children, Dust and daemonds. A search that can relate to our own search to find ourselves."
5,A Must Read,"This book is filled with adventure and excitement. Once you start readiing you don't want to stop because you want to know what happens so much. The way the author wrote this book is truly spectacular and won't let you stop reading the book. The detai is amazing. The new ideas like, daemons, lifelong friends, that are bonded to human since birth are creative and new. this book defenetly deserveres a rating higher than five."
5,Magical and genius,"Upon first reading this stunning fantasy in 1998 as a 5th-grader, I didn't like it. However, something made me read it again a few years later, and I went ahead to read the next two in the series. Pullman's Golden Compass is a masterpiece. The invention of daemons, though similar to that of Pokemon, is very creative as well as symbolic of one's personality. Lyra (the main character) feels real. The character development is superb and the action engaging. It was this combination of fantasy and humanity that really stuck to me, pushing me further into the His Dark Materials series..."
4,a fantastic multi layered story,"this the first of the dark materials trilogy called the golden compass known to me as northern lights as this is the title it is published under here in the UK follows the adventures of young hero lyra belacqua and her demon companion pantalaimon in this world every human has their own animal shaped demon and it is unthinkable that anyone would not have a demon ,lyra adventures go from her home in Jordan college in Oxford to london then a boat journey to the fens and then up to the arctic circle after one of her friends is kidnapped by the gruesome Gobblers this is obviously a tightly ,multi layered series of books which in my opinion are more adult reading than childrens as some of the passages are quite gory and adult.This book is for the person who has finished Harry Potter and wants a book to stretch them a bit further,if you like gypsies,witches,armoured bears and a plot which twists and turns like a plate of spaghetti this is the book for you ENJOY!."
4,The Golden Compass,"This is a very good beginning to a triliogy of books.It is a story about a girl named Lyra and her adventures. In the beginning of the story she leads a carefree life that includes exploring and watching over kids at the college.Her life begins to change after her ""uncle"" comes to the college to give a presentation but is nearly killed. Lyra overhears the presentation about Dust which is a very mysterious substance.After the whole incidence with her uncle, Lyra's best friend Roger disappears. He is believed to of been kidnapped by Gobblers, which are a group of people that kidnap people to perform experiments on them in the artic.Lyra then goes on an adventure to save Roger. On the way she finds out many things about her family and whats really going on in the world.I would recommend this story to any person who is looking for a good adventure story."
5,"Really good, i enjoyed it alot","It is a great book. i couldent put it down! you will love it no matter what the age. it has alot of mysterys to begin with, then at the end all of the mysterys, most of the mysterys, are solved, the left overs are in the Subtle Knife!"
4,....................................,"Many people don't like this book because it is anti christian. When i read it and found out it took an anti-christan stance i was like, okay, i don't agree, but the book's good. But i am willing to admit that Iorek, the bear, probably made me like this book. So cheers for him. The first time i read this, it was a bit confusing and over my head, so i reread it and liked it a lot more. Nothing made me laugh though, and it would have been better if there were some sarcastic comments or something, but it was a little intense for laughter."
5,You'll Love This Book!,"This book was extremely good. It had all the elements of a classic novel: Many details, a beginning that starts you thinking, and a good, solid story that answers many of your questions from the beginning. Lyra and her daemon are two of the characters in books that you can easily agree with (usually)."
5,A Dazzling Book!,"I've read a lot of books and this is definitely the best. I've also read the Subtle Knife and I can't wait for the next Dark Materials book. If I were to recommend a book this book would be it! Philip Pullman expresses his uncommon beliefs but they're his and no one can take them away.You'll love this book I'm sure. (review by Jake Brown, age 9)"
5,"A gotta get, gotta read, gotta finish kinda book!",A touching story about a young girl who is full of life and adventure and is dieing to go north. You have to get this book! I saw in the library one day and checked it out. I read it constantly. Once I was finished with the Golden Compass I waited eagerly to go get the Subtle Knife. Buy this book and believe me you'll be asking for more of Philip Pullman's great books!
5,The Best Book in the World,"The Golden Compass is probably the best book I've ever read, and I've read alot of books. I never wanted to put it down because every page was an exciting adventure. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
4,Good book!,"I really liked the book! It left my dying to know what was going to happen next. And I still haven't read the sequel to it. It's a magical book and also a mystery. I recommend it to around 11 and up because I read it when I was 11 and I still thought it was good. If you are thinking about buying this book, let me tell you this: It is really good!"
4,a good book...,"i really liked ""the golden compass""... fascinating, exciting and suspenseful, you'll remember it for a long time. It begs you to read it's sequel, ""the subtle knife"", tho i didn't like it as much as ""the golden compass"", i have yet to read ""the amber spyglass"". be warned tho, if you are very easily offended, especially about religion, i wouldn't recommend this book."
4,will adults love this book?,I read about this series in the NY Times Book review and I was intrigued enough to buy The Golden Compass.I read the book in one sitting during a cross country plane trip and I must admit that it kept my attention. Pullman is an imaginative author and his book deserves acclaim. But better than Harry? A good read for adults? I don't know about that. It is awfully long and I found myself skimming the final 100+ pages just to find out how it all turns out.The other day I was standing in a bookstore with the sequel in my hand. I read the first page and put the book back on the shelf. I guess that tells you all you have to know.
3,An OK book,"I read this book for my AP english class as a freshman. I was rushed to read it, but I really enjoyed it. If you are into science fiction an like intriging books, then no doubt this is the book to indulge yourself in this summer. It is the story of a girl in another world and her struggles to search for the truth as well as her past."
4,Brilliantly written,"What a very powerful boo,. Very well written. I was not prepared for the cruelty toward children nor for some of the graphic fights, but it was a brilliant book nonetheless."
5,Much better than the movie.,More depth and better storyline than the movie. This books reads quickly and a good way to expand your vocabulary. It has an imaginative story that's hard to second guess. You'll want to order the second volume early so you can continue the epic.
3,Disapointed,"Maybe it was all the hype I got from friends who'd read it and recommended it, but it seems over-rated. Gets off to a slow start and doesn't really pick up and become a page-turner until Lyra falls through the ceiling and is in real danger. However, at that point I started to have a hard time suspending my disbelief over the fact that this 11-year-old can understand what's going on, be that clever, and have the conversations she's having. It's all too perfect. Still, I must admit that I have already put a reserve on the second book from the library, because I want to know what happens, so in that respect it's successful."
1,Against God,"All of this guy's books are pretty impressive, and the descriptions are pretty good, but I don't like the idea of all this pegan stuff he put in it. Also, the movie that is based on all his books is filled with propaganda as well. My daughter had heard of it and, being very imaginative, wanted to watch both the movie and read the books. But after I looked it up on Christian reviews, we both decided it was definitely not within our christian range. Therefore I advise against any of this person's books including the movie."
2,A good book for an adult...the trilogy becomes antireligious at the end,"I do not think this book should be given to young children who are looking for a good read. The themes in this book include a nun who breaks her vow of chastity and counsels the two main characters to have sex. Additionaly, God is pictured as an old man locked inside a box. The messages in the book are subtle and not apparent in the first book. I liked the trilogy but find it disturbing that it is given a good recommendation by librarians and booksellers without any thought as to the content or the appropriateness of the recommendation."
1,book of potential... destroyed,"I bought this book as a gift for someone. Naturally, I read it before I gave it away. The bottom line is that I didn't like it so very much that I gave this person something else instead, thinking they should have a good gift.Don't get me wrong, the story had a lot of potential, but as you get closer to the end you begin to notice that things are drawn out and entirely unfinished for the sake of a sequel. No discernable climax in the book. It's sad really, but there it is. At the end of the book it felt like all of the characters had just wasted their time not really ultimately doing anything. What a gip."
1,Completely Boring,"This book was completely boring to me. It was well written, but I formed no attachment to the characters except perhaps, the polar bear. The plot was a little better, but I found myself skimming pages.The basic plot: Lyra is a girl who lives in a world where everyone has a daemon. A daemon is like an companion that is connected to a person though some special bond. There seems to be a conspiracy afoot that involves Lyra's uncle and the scholars at Oxford University. Lyra's best friend is kidnapped along with other children. Lyra sets out to find her friend....The plot continues from there, and seems very dark and serious. There is murder and violence, but I was so uninterested in the book, that I hardly felt it. I don'tthink that this should be listed as a children's book, but I don't think that children(or adults) will find this interesting at all."
4,Northern Lights,"This book started slowly. I found the start so boring that i nearly put it down, but luckily i kept going. Once the story really starts the exitement begins and you find yourself captured inside the secrets and terrors of Pullmans imagination. dont do what i nearly did and put the book down! you will regret it if you do. Not neccasarily a book for harry potter fans and lord of the rings fans. A fantasy that has many links to our world. The end is a bit rushed and dissapointing, maybe to make people read the second. it worked for me and now im reading the third. a great book"
3,Decent but disappointing,"After hearing rave reviews of this book, I read it for myself and found it very disappointing. Though quite well-imagined and pristinely written, it failed to involve me emotionally in its characters and plot. I enjoy novels with philosophical subtext and complex internal logic, but this was somehow....lacking. While Harry Potter's philosophy is light-weight in comparison, its emotional implications pack a far more powerful punch than The Golden Compass's. I cared about Harry. I didn't care about Lyra. (And I cared even less about armored polar bears...)"
4,A Pleasant Enjoyment!,"I am writing this review on behalf of a fantastic group of 6th grade ladies at Boston Collegiate Charter School. Some strengths of the book are that it has great sensory detail and a good plot with a surprising ending. On the other hand, at times it was confusing and hard to follow with long explanations. Overall, though, it was a pleasant experience."
1,a kids review,"My gosh! this is the most atheist book i have ever read. pretty much evreyone has read or heard in the iterview that the authour is in where he says, ""my books are trying to kill God."" He has been called one of the most dangerous authours in all of britian. The movie is being released on Dec. 7. It's rated PG 13. I would not suggest any parents taking their kids to these movies unless they are and have been atheists all their lives."
5,Invigorating read,"This book is an invigorating read. It has action from beginning to end. I do not find it to be counter to my faith as a Christian at all. If I believed my faith to be one that hemmed me in and one that was binding, it would be contrary to my faith. However, I find Christianity to be liberating and the key to an abundant life, and I find nothing like this prohibited or attacked in this book."
5,The ending does have a point!,"I have been reading the reviews that people have written, and I was surprised to see that many reviewers thought that the book was a waste because of the ending or that many things went unanwsered. The ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy was supposed to be ""Paradise Lost"" in 1,200 pages. The idea fell in to three parts, the Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. The end of The Golden Compass was a cliff hanger just to make room for the second part of the book, just like a second chapter. If you think too many questions were not anwsered, then I suggest you read The Subtle Knife."
4,Think you don't like fantasy? Read this!,"I always said to people that I didn't like fantasy or science fiction novels. Then I bought this at a bookstore, and I couldn't put it down. The plot is so unique and original, and the world is so believable that you find yourself wishing that you too had a daemon companion. This is a great introduction to a fantastic series."
5,What a unique story!,"The Golden Compass is a book that I thought I wasn't going to finish. Then suddenly, I realized that it was growing and growing on me until I was to the point that I couldn't stop reading. I am glad that I stuck it out because this ended up being a teriffic book. It is set in an interesting world with complex characters and exciting action. I will not go into detail, but I will say that Iorek is the baddest bear ever. Literarily, it is a step up from most fantasy aimed at children 9-12 years old, and it is way better than the Chronicles of Narnia. I look forward to finishing the series, but I will wait about a month before I dive into number 2, because I like to spread my attention around. But the Golden Compass is just that, golden."
5,How could someone not like this book?,"This is the best book I have EVER read. The plot is a twisting and twirling roller coaster ride. Characters that someone can actually believe in. Lyra and Pan have all the adventures every kid would dream of having. It has all the magic one can imagine to be in Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" and Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", I seriously excepted Harry Potter to come flying out on his Firebolt with Serafina at his side, well, not really. Pullman sets a high standard for himself to make the rest of ""His Dark Materials"" just as good, which he does wonderfully, just like he does with the Sally Lockhart books. ""The Golden Compass"" has a wonderfully crafted ending that makes you run out of your chair, go to the nearest bookstore, empty your coffee money to buy the ""Subtle Knife"" Which is exactly what I did."
4,Great deal!,Book arrived earlier than expected. Really wanted a hard cover to match set but was delighted to find this paperback edition was signed by the author.
4,A classic to be,"‘The Golden Compass’ is a book with many different worlds and views. With twists, turns, and adventures here and there, this book is page after page, going on and on, on a long and suspending ride, and when it stops, you wish you could keep going. However, they do stretch some parts in the book and that makes me a little irritated. I find it would be vague for children under the age of 11. It would be a perfect for a young teen though."
4,fun filled thrilling imaginative ride........,i had never read a Phillipe Pullman book before...and when i started reading this book i was partly confused cuz i dint understand that DEMON thing......but as the book stated to unravel everything starts making sense.......the IMagination of PULLMAN is just stunning and the suspense and the thrill of this book is Gripping enough......the ending is quiet a cliffhanger..........all in all a good read..........
4,Innocence begins the journey,"A child begins a journey without the usual parental guides. Trusting strangers until they betray her, Lyra embarks on an adventure that will lead at least to other worlds and certainly to self awareness and maturity. Surprising numbers of betrayals and tragedies make this a very different child's fantasy. I'm hooked."
2,Phillip Pullman is a freak of nature.,"I am a new member of EFAAAL, a group of reviewers which is growing quickly. Along with a lot of other people, I, Calandra Garton, believe this book does not deserve to be published. Sorry, but that's just my thought. And I also agree with the readers from San Jose and Mexico City. I support you two."
1,Simply did not like,"This is a book that I read all the way through hoping that eventually it would get better. The writing is so poor that it was almost painful to read. Pullman, an adult male, has a very poor grasp on Lyra, his girl heroine. The Daemon concept is never fully articulated, and if I hadn't read the jacket I would have never understood it. In my mind, this is the quality of a first draft that needs a major overhaul. Great concept, dismal follow through."
4,The Golden Compass,"In the book The Golden Compass, Philip Pullman writes about the hardships and rewards of being a witch. He goes through the life of a little girl named Maria, and how hard it is for her to cope with her uncle, the head sourcer of Tourlox the town they live in. All of the people in Tourlox have these little ""shape shifters"" who are alot alike a servant, they do what they are told but whatever you tell them to do they cant get hurt. Maria and her shape shifter named Pentalomen go through the town causing troubble and finding out what the real scoop is and uncovering the dirt in the town. Many people don't like Maria but everyone knows her and know that they are in for a treat when she is around."
1,Potential butchered,"The plot starts off really slow. It does eventually develop into a good and exciting book. In fact I was thinking I really liked the book despite the beginning, until I got to the end. The book ends with a sad, pointless, dispicable ending. It just made me mad that such good potential could be butchered in such a terrible way. I'm returning the book."
1,If you want disobedient children,"If you want your children to believe it is heroic to disobey parents, adults are evil, and demons are their friends, then perhaps you will want this book."
4,The Golden Compass,"Lyra has always been adventurous and it has led her into several awkward predicaments, but she is about to stumble into her greatest adventure yet. An unknown force, known only as the Gobblers, has been stealing children. Rumors abound about what happens to the stolen children. When one of Lyra's friends is taken, she decides that she must go find him.Her quest takes her across the world from the city of Oxford to the swamps where the gyptians live and finally in to frozen north of Svalbard. Here she discovers the awful truth of what the Gobblers are really doing, and it's worse than anyone had imagined.Lyra's adventures are beyond belief and fantastic. While she can be quite an obnoxious brat at times, you can't help but fall in love with her and her friends. Her friends are varied but loyal. There's just something about the girl that they can't resist wanting to help. The story is written in a way that draws you into her life and had you rooting for her the whole time.4/5"
4,Very Intriguing,"I'll be honest: I wanted a subsitute for Harry Potter...Did I ever get it! Golden Compass is almost better than Harry Potter. I am into the second book of this series right now and it's incredible. The imagination Pullman has is magic. Harry Potter and this series are wonderful books for fantasy lovers. The beginning will be a little confusing, of course but by the second/third chapter you will know *exactly* what's going on and will be able to go on the adventure with Lyra. I hear the third book (Amber Spyglass) is even better than the first two books in the series..and I'm really looking forward to buy it! The series is incredible. You really should have a go at it."
4,WONDERFUL ADVENTURE FOR ALL AGES,"I purchased this book as a gift for a pre-teen. I decided to read a few pages to get a taste of the story. Before I knew it, I was sucked right into Lyra's big adventure. Pullman is an extraordinarily gifted writer who also happens to be a master story teller. I liked this book so much, I ran out and bought the sequel (The Subtle Knife) as soon as I finished."
2,The race to the Golden Compass,"Hey you! Ya you! When was the last time you read a fantasy story? How long? Wow, a year that's a long time. Well if you like fantasies, made you would like this. (That is, if you like to be confused ). The title is The Golden Compass.The main character is name Lyra. She lives in another dimension. The place she lives has other creatures and strange things. Also her best friend is a diamond. The author is Philip Pullman. This trilogy novel. The first book he wrote. There is a second book called the Sacred Sword (I think that is the title), also the third book is called the Amber Spy Glass.I Think am a confusing book because it jumps around. (See it just goes around that is confusing)? The book is about a girl trying to get The Golden Compass. They run into a lot of problems. I should not tell you those problems. You'll have to read it to figure it out."
3,Did I miss something?,"The Golden Compass is held by many to be marvelous, entertaining, and imaginative children's books. Fond of fantasy and children's books, I decided to try the book out. After reading it, I was a little bit depressed. While the tale is suspenseful, I didn't find the storyline quite so interesting. Another thing I didn't really like about it was that the book was not written with the reader in mind. I know that this is the author's writing style, but I find that this style of writing is not helpful in a children's fantasy book. I want to be drawn into the story. Pullman's story left me out. (I would say an author like Roald Dahl draws the reader in.) And lastly, for a fantasy book, the tale was not very imaginative. There weren't many made up creatures, or events inexplicable by modern means. So overall, I found the tale satisfactory, but certainly not thrilling. I suppose I will get to the next book in the series eventually, though."
5,Golden Compass ROCKS,"This is a must-read for all fantasy fans--and get the set now that you're at it!Pullman creates a believable world, unlike many ther fantasy writers, and he creates lovely characters that develop.Please, READ it."
5,Wow!!!!!!,"This is one of my all time favorite books!!! It was amazing!!! I have read all of the His Dark Materials books and this is by far my favorite. It's so captivating, I read it in 2 days. I actually did it in school. My teachers kept getting mad at me but I'd just pick it right back up five minutes later. Read it!!! my dad read it to me when I was like six. I liked it then and I like it even more now. It doesn't matter how old or young you are, you will love it. For little kids, I creates a world."
3,A very disturbing book.,"This book effectively holds your interest throughout although the subject matter of torturing and killing children is disturbing. The ending is a disappointment with no resolution, no emotional release. The author clearly has one thing in mind, he wants you to buy part two. I think I'll pass."
3,Missing Pages in Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition,"Three stars. What I read, I enjoyed. Unfortunately when I got to page 116 of the Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition of THE GOLDEN COMPASS, it skipped to page 149. Hopefully the replacement copy I requested will be complete."
1,"Blech. Great start, ok through the middle, dissapointing ending.","I really liked how this book started out, but the overall feeling of the book from towards the end made me drop the whole series. Don't waste your time, there's better reading out there."
3,Not so bad,the his dark material series is not soo bad. i mean just for timepass u may pick it up n read. it is not as good as harry potter series ofcourse but not a push away also.
4,late to the party,"I'm coming late to this popular fantasy trilogy, of which THE GOLDEN COMPASS is the first part. The setting is a world very much like but not entirely our own. Lyra, a young girl raised in the halls of an Oxford college, is hurled into a massive effort by the Church to reverse original sin (called ""Dust""). The plans involve kidnapping children and separating them from their daemons, the animal projections of their soul.Both of Lyra's parents are involved in the effort to understand Dust, and indeed Lyra's father may have discovered a portal to another world. THE GOLDEN COMPASS is often marketed to young adults, but the concerns are really adult. At what moment do we ""grow up"", how do we change? What is it that separates adults from children? There's high adventure but also a philosophical journey, and I look forward to reading the second & third volumes. Highly recommended."
5,The book everyone should read...,"This is my first review, so I thought I should choose a book IREALLY enjoyed. I've read this book 5 times as well as it's sequel,and I can't wait for the third to be published! The plot is greatbecause no matter what you look for in a book you'll get it here; horror, suspense, action, adventure, mystery, sci-fi- whatever! And the best thing about it is Pullman writes so you can imagine it's REAL. I liked the heroine best of all. Lyra is funny, wity, brave and adventurous, and best of all she isn't helpless. Daemons- they're a stroke of genius. Soul mates who share your every thought and feeling. The theories are awsome. Read this book the first chance you get and thank me latter."
5,The Best book I've ever read!!!!!!!!,I've read other Philip Pullman books but this is definitelythe best. It takes a little while to get in to it and to realise whatDaemons are meant to be but after that is thouroughly absorbing. Lyra and the other characters are brilliantly formed and the content is wonderful. As soon as I finished it I had to read the Subtle Knife. I wish I also had a Daemon. I would recommend it to ages 12 and up.
5,my piece of mind,"The book,The Golden Compass was an imazingly beutiful book. Philip Pullman has conjured a magical story with strong bonds between humans and animals. Pullman is a wonderful story teller that grabs your attention from the very first page.I really enjoyed this book because of the way the magic is twisted into a mystery that slowly unfolds to startling revolations. The world pullman shows you involves gypsies, witches, humans, and most of all the bond between deamons. If you are a reader that enjoys a book with mysteries, good characters, magic, exciting fast moving plot that will catch you off guard this book will be good for you. I strongly recomend this book to anyone who wants to escape. This book ends in a way where you will want to jump right into the sequal which just as promising as the fist. So, if your looking for a book that will keep your attention and have you always wanting to read the next page this book is for you."
4,Not just for fantasy lovers...,"I am more of a 'classic literature' lover, and when it comes to fantasy, I generally stick to the very classic classics, such as ""The Last Unicorn"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but I was completely drawn into and fascinated by this book. The story of Lyra Belacqua and her not-quite-like-our world where she is drawn into a fight for what she thinks is to save her friend, but we learn is much farther reaching. Although classified as a children's book, there is much more to keep an educated adult entertained. The concept is very complex, and, if you read it while thinking, can bring up issues about God, religion, science, human emotions such as loneliness and the will to be individual, and, of course, the ongoing battle between Good and Evil. This book also made me want a ""daemon"". Read the whole trilogy!"
3,The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman,"This book was Ok. I would compare it to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, because, unlike the first book in many trilogies, you can be satisfied after reading the first book. I don't mean to say that you should only read one book, because the The Golden Compass leads you into the world of Philip Pullman's dream-filled creations. The way Philip Pullman writes makes this book go very fast, but you can still grasp the adventure. I would suggest this book for fantasy and sci-fi fans alike."
5,Wow!,"If you liked A Wrinkle in Time, you'll love The Golden Compass. Its a mix of fantasy, science fiction, and a little bit of horror. It's a marvelous book!"
5,WOW!!,"This book is exciting and well written, if not always clear. Lyra is an imperfect character, which I think is a good quality, who knows how to stand up for herself, but she is not a good judge of character. I can't elaborate much, because it would give away the story. If you are going to start reading ""The Golden Compass"", be sure to get ""The Subtle Knife"" and ""His Dark Matirials"" first. I have not yet read the later, but the first two have cliff-hanger endings worse than the ends of most chapters. Don't be scared off because of the lenth of these books. Once I got into them, I found them far to short."
3,Interesting Philosophy; Mediocre Writing,"Maybe it's my fault I disliked this book. I have seen many recommendations for it, so I thought it would be a decent read. I must have had too high of expectations.The author presented important philosophical questions. I have heard that many people dismiss this book because of the author's philosophy, but I think it is important for people to read opposing ideas so that their mind can stretch.My problem with the book relates to the quality of its writing. Recently, I've read several books designed for similar age groups. These other books consistently painted an image of the narrative as I read through them. The quality of writing in this book varied from page to page. At times, I would find myself sufficiently engaged. However, there were more times when I would be caught up in the book only to have an awkwardly worded phrase knock me off track. I expected more from a book so widely heralded."
4,Good but Not Great,"The main character Lyra is described well. She is likeable and her adventure is great. There is a great deal of magic and different creatures in this story. My favorite is the armored bears. When I was reading this, it never really kept me all that captivated, sometimes I found it boring, but overall it was quite well done and I will read the next two to finish the set. Don't get me wrong, there are some great parts, when Lyra learns her past and there is a good amount of mystery still to be unraveled as we see in the stunning ending."
5,Read this book!,"This book is VERY well written, with all its fantasy and details, but not too many details so that you get lost. Its a thrilling tale, full of action, and amazing imaginary creatures, yet quiet and peaceful in some places.This book can transport you to another world, and you feel you're there, right in the midst of it! Philip Pullman Pullman has a wonderful imagination, and the sequels to this book are equally enchanting."
3,Praise Is What I Do,"I didn't really enjoy the CD, not because of the music but because I didn't know that it was only one music that was on the CD repeated over and over. Maybe I should have paid more attention so that I don't make that type of mistake. I do have the music in other CD albums. But I thought the CD had other music in it, otherwise I would not have bought it. Thanks."
