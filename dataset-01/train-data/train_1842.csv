2,Painfully Tuneless,"It's not whether or not you ""get"" Roger Waters, it's the fact that, aside from the title track, Every Stranger's Eyes, and Sexualy Revolution, this is an utterly tuneless album that even Eric Clapton can't save. It's a good thing that Gilmour and co. chose to do the Wall instead of spending time on this lame excuse of a CD."
1,The Cons of of an over inflated ego,"This album was one of the greatest disappointments for me ever as a rock fan. Pink Floyd was my favorite group when this came out--and landed with a huge thud. There is simply not a single decent song, melody or interesting lyric on the whole album. The album allegedly tells the tales of some hippies who moved to the countryside. Excuse me, but this was in 1984, who cared about hippies anymore? Eric Clapton must have been short on cash the week he agreed to apprear on this farce. Stay away, far away, from this total musical mistake."
1,craptastic,"The first of 3 post pink floyd albums. Of all of them, this has to be the crappiest. I guess since he knew it wouldn't sell well because he couldn't put Pink Floyd on the cover, he put a half naked chick on the cover. Nice. Roger must have had something on Eric Clapton to make him play on this album. Even with him on this album, it still sucked. I have to say his other albums were at least decent this is just not worth listening to."
1,A truly weak album,"Well, after listening to this album, now I know where Marylin Manson got his inspiration for the insipid ""Antichrist Superstar"". Waters has got to be the lamest, dumbest, most rediculous excuse for a ""cult icon"" ever. At times, I almost pity Rog. It's so easy to see that he's pretty much just an average joe blessed with exceptionally mediocre intelligence and little natural musical talent.The only reason to listen to this album is for the lyrics, as there is no musical substance to be found. And if all you want is to have lyrics recited to you, why not just get some good poetry on tape? .Seriously, Waters should just write a book filled with all of his ""insights"" and just get it out of his system.Don't even think about listening to waters other solo albums either, they're just as popouse and senseless as this on. All in all, the only solo Floyd matrial worth checking out is Syd Barrett's first solo album, ""The Madcap Laughs""."
4,Not as great as I was hoping.,"Now that I have the whole thing, I can understand why I only was given the first half on tape. From the start to ""The Remains of Our Love"" there is definite cohesion and smooth transitions which make it feel like one fantastic song. However, from ""Go Fishing"" on, I feel like he just wanted to add filler. That is why you hear melodies from other works like ""In the Flesh"" from The Wall. Some cohesion is still there, but it just doesn't flow with the first half IMHO. Upon reading another review here, I did get Amused to Death. It is definitely a more complete album and worth getting. All in all, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is still a great piece of work, and well worth the money to get."
4,needs digesting,"I caught a couple of youtube videos of ""comfortably numb"" and ""shine on you crazy diamond"" and recognized the recent anniversary of Syd's passing so I have been thinking about Water's creative talent.This is the first entirely Water's piece of art I have purchased and it reminds me much of ""The Wall"" and ""The Final Cut"". I have only had it for about 12 hours but I have enjoyed repeated listenings!"
4,Waters is just great,"I have always wondered why people keep comparing different albums and try to have a point of reference. Bottom line is if you enjoy Waters/Pink Floyd, this is a must-have album. Clapton guitar adds a different dimension to Waters work. It is as if you can trace the blues roots in the psychedelic genre. Sanborn mixes the jazz element and Waters voice is as solid as always. In fact his voice is just imperfectly perfect. Now adding the late Michael Kamen and the National Philarmonic Orchestra and you really can't go wrong.Great songs are plenty. The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, Every Strangers Eyes, Go Fishing and ...And finally the lyrics are strong as always. What else is there to a great album?"
4,Excellent Trip,"I really like this and I am not a fan of Rogers. Don't expect great songs here, the title track might be the only real song here and its the weakest on the album - but it is a commerical overture that seems to achieve the goal of leading to the close of the album. Clearly meant to be heard start to finish, I like the trip, and music moves well, the sax and Clapton's sparse guitar rifs fill in the beauty of the picture being painted here. Reading the other reviews I realize the story that plays in my head may not be exactly what its supposed to be! Oh well! I like the roadtrip the album takes me on."
3,Intimate!,"This is definitely not one of Waters best works, but it's such an intimate album! It must be damn hard for a musician to write something about personal, intimate feelings and experiences such as the permanent fear of losing someone so close to you. I have the feeling Waters is talking about something that really used to happen to him...this is a work about everyone of us, about our fears, paranoias, nightmares...don't you say you never felt this kind of things - feeling that you are never going to make it, feeling that you might lose something, feeling that you might stop breathing while you're asleep, that one day you might feel dumped and alone... Ok, the guy became paranoid since ""The wall"", and if you don't agree with that, just listen to ""The last cut"" and this one. But I wouldn't say this is a bad album: it's not a masterpiece, but it's a good work that one, not necessarely a Waters fan, could listen from time to time."
2,"Dreary, Self-Absorbed, & Unmelodic!","He ruined Floyd to do this???Great band! Great story & concept! Unfortunately the songs are dreary & not catchy! This is self-absorbed mysogyny, and lyrically top-heavy! Melody wise this is paper-thin! The Wall & Final Cut were both dreary, but both had solid songs with good hooks! Rog, it's called collaboration...look into it!PROS: Nice guitar solo on Sexual Revolution from Slowhand, and the brief duet on For the First Time Today Part 2 was a pleasant surprise!CONS: Clapton, Sandborn & the other A-Listers take a backseat to Waters' self-absorbed mysogynistic lyrics. The concept is an interesting one involving dreams, temptation & fidelity (kind of like Doctor Zhivago goes on a cross country trip across Europe). With a little less lyrics, some well written hooks from Clapton, and perhaps just a lttle more lead singing from others and this could have been a classic."
3,Just a little worse with age,"I had just about discovered and become addicted to Pink Floyd in 1984 at the same time this solo album came out. So naturally, I loved it (hell, Roger Waters could have released a record of him reciting a recipe and I would have loved THAT, too) and the provocative album cover. I was 16! Who wouldn't enjoy a blonde piece of ass standing on the highway?Twenty years later, the album does not hold up as well. Except for the title track and ""Every Stranger's Eyes"", it offers little in terms of music, lyrics and concept. Although a bit more ""campy"", ""Radio K.A.O.S."" faired better with me three years later."
5,*****Brilliant*****,Brilliant album with Clapton on guitar. It just doesn't get any better than this.
5,six stars?,"This is one of my favourite albums, it contains all that i want in a recording.Roger invited Eric Clapton to play the guitar, so, we have in this CD two of the greatest genius in the story of rock, Roger in the composition and Eric (as always) with an excellent guitar work.The rest of the band was formed by (another genius) Michael Kamen, Ray Cooper and another talented musicians.This is a must in a progressive rock collection, you will love it since the first time you listen to."
5,Get The IMPORT Version Only,"I'm so happy I just found this IMPORT version of the CD. As you can see, on the album/CD cover art, the girl's behind is not covered with a black rectangle mask like the US version has had since the CD was released in the 80s. For those of you who bought the LP when it originally came out, this extremely offensive black mask was only on the cellophane LP covering so as to not permenantly destroy the underlying artwork. The lazy and thoughtless defacement of this beautiful CD artwork has rankled and infuriated me since it came out. I am utterly thrilled to see the original LP artwork restored to its original condition on this CD IMPORT version!"
4,Obscure classic,"Ok, I grew up on a Pink Floyd music diet and have owned every single album of theirs and their solo offsprings. But of all, this one has touched me the deepest. It was the first CD I got when I began replacing my album collection and it is probably the most played ever. It is musically very talented at times, albeit with some strange moments, but it always manages to take me to that special place, reminding me of the happy times and great memories growing up. Clapton's work is the best I have heard from him (IMHO), I just wish he played like that more often. Listening to anything else from Clapton now seems too restricted in comparison. I recommend this album to anyone that appreciates music from the heart. Music is the best natural legal drug and this is a perfect example."
4,"High Concept, no singles.","If you have ever tried to write down a dream after waking, you'll appreciate this album. The premise is simple; a man has a long, twisting dream, alternatively pleasurable and painful. The sometimes smooth and sometimes jarring transitions between songs reflects the mental state of the dreamer and translates well musically, giving the album an edge that many may not like. For sheer horsepower, this album lines up Waters with Eric Clapton, David Sanborn, and Michael Kamen, among others. The voice cameo by Jack Palance is also pretty trippy. A great album, but not one for the faint of heart expecting trite singles."
2,One word...BORING,"I just do not like this album. The music is uninspired, and it seems too dark and bleak (after all, it IS about dreams). The only song I liked on this album was ""4:41AM (Sexual Revolution)"", but one song does not an album make. Only true Waters fans (or maybe only hardcore Waters fans) should get this one. I;m a Waters fan, but I do not like this one."
1,yeah...this was a good buy,"i can't really say i'm a pink floyd fan and after getting this album i'm certainly not a roger waters fan, but this album was just horrible. i noticed that a lot of the other reviews talked about the wall which, in most people's views, was a great album. the idea of the concept album is great and has a place in music and art but where the wall loosely linked the songs together with the concept allowing songs to stand on their own, this piece requires the listener to spend 45 minutes to get the idea that nothing's being said. maybe i just don't get the deep meaning buried within the pointless tunes, but then why should we have to work hard? the best songs have deep meaning and are good to listen to. anyone can throw another brick in the wall part 2 in the cd player after a day dealing with society and enjoy that song without having to listen to both disks just to get an idea of what's going on. DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!"
4,PNY 128 mb DIMM,"The product fit perfectly into my laptop and now, my laptop is faster. Unless your laptop is not compliant with this product, I recommend it."
1,Holy Sababa! This movie sucks!,"The only entertainment value this movie had was listening to our 7 year-old, 9 year-old, and 11 year-old make fun of it. Painful to watch."
4,Pewter jewelry holder,The jewelry holder is quite attractive and holds many earrings. It's a little difficult getting the earrings off the holder if they have a backing but all in all I quite like it.
1,Absolute waste of money and frustration for a toddler,These are horrible. The blocks will not stick together well at all so you just end up with a frustrated child. I wish we had never bought these! My advice is to wait until your child is old enough for Duplo because they can snap together and stay together until the child *wants* to take them apart.
2,"Skip Quatro, go straight for the Duplo","My daughter has had these for a year now (she is now 2), and doesn't play with them. They are almost too big for little hands. I have difficulties getting them to stay together (too loose!) and the lid is concave. I love the idea of Legos and will now move on to Duplos (which she DOES play with). I wish I had save the twenty dollars and bought Duplos in the first place."
3,"Lots of fun, but frustrating to small builders...stick to mega bloks maxis","after much researching, i purchased these blocks for my 3 year old. I chose these because the lego quatro big bucket is the only brand of giant blocks that currently offers the lid of the bucket as a a building platform.(the mega blok maxi tub has been discontinued). they are a lot of fun but the only issue is the tabs, you know the little bumps you connect the blocks together with are very small and flat, unlike the large tabs mega bloks offers. this takes much more precision to line up & actually connect the blocks together. and in turn caused more frustration than fun...they are more expensive than the mega bloks also..they are being returned to toys r us tommorow!"
4,Looks good,"Good looking design. Since it's a sarong, I don't think there's any need to say it's comfortable. Wore it for almost an entire weekend on a camping trip."
4,Overall this book is hard to grasp for first time TW readers,"If you are interested in twists, turns and some descriptive writing, this book is for you. If you can stomach some things that you normally wouldn't like then you can enter the marvelous world of Santuary."
2,Not large print as advertised,"I purchase large print books for an elderly family member, and although this particular book was advertised as such, it was only regular print. The Aunt Dimity series are great books for light readers and I give them 5 stars, but this 2 star rating is because I'm tired of ordering large print books from Amazon (which in all fairness I do get about 60% of the time) but getting regular type."
5,Enchanting suspense -- How refreshing!,"I found Aunt Dimity quite by accident. Since the first book, I have read all but two, and I have those on order. Lori is such a likable protagonist, although Aunt Dimity steals the show. I actually read two in one day -- Almost like peanuts: these books are so engaging that one just wants to stay in the Aunt Dimity world as long as possible!"
2,If you're bothered by typos in a book ...,"I just finished reading the Penguin 2000 hard cover edition, and it has at least 5 typos. They're all in the category of words that obviously were passed over by an electronic spell checker, but certainly would have been caught by a human proofreader, like the word ""noting"" when ""nothing"" is meant, or ""thought"" when ""though"" is meant.I hope the publisher did a better job with the paperback edition, because typos like these really detract from the pleasure of reading."
4,All of the Aunt Dimity series,"I am an expat living in Singapore, also very bored, between the serious reading,""Conversation with God"" for example I discovered the Dimity series, have enjoyed it immmensly. A days read which actually relaxes me and takes my mind off other problems.So a big thank you to the author, Can't she write quicker! What am I to do now!"
4,"More Ben Stillman, Less [love scenes] (please)","I enjoyed this book, though less than ONCE A MARSHALL. Stillman is a [handsome] guy-- not ""over the hill,"" but nearing the crest. And Fay is a smart, saavy, [beautiful] woman. And I love seeing the two of them interact-- but I don't want to go into the bedroom.I'd always thought that westerns were ""men's books."" Most impressive for me about Brandvold stories and characters-- outside the sirloin studio-- is that they appeal to women as well as to men. ONCE MORE WITH A .44 falls a mite short in its appeal. First, because of the descriptive [love scenes]; second, because the [love scenes] interferes with the storyline. I think that shoot-out on the train is one heck of a scene, and Ben is all hero. It's his nature. Leon's arrival tweaks the dynamics of plot and character. I'd like to see more. Read more. But right now I'm heading into DAKOTA KILL.... And looking forward to more western and less romance."
4,Once more...,"A number of years ago I got hooked on the romanticized Western stories of Louis L' Amour. I read every one of 'em. Reading books by Louis L'Amour is like eating potato chips. Once you empty the bag you need more. So I have been looking for authors who can deliver a similar experience ever since. For me, Peter Brandvold has been hit or miss. He tells a good story but I find his characters often have attitudes and mannerisms that I feel are too modern for characters living on the frontier in the late 1800's. That said, ""Once More with a .44"" is a fun read and a worthy addition to author Brandvold's ""Once..."" series featuring former U.S. Deputy Marshall turned Sheriff Ben Stillman."
3,ONLY A THREE????? REASONS BELOW!!!,"This is the second in the series about Ben Stillman. Ben has returned to Clantick, Montanta to clean up the town. He has again been requested by Jody Harmon. The train Ben is rideing is held up as he goes to Clantick. As the story unfolds he is really after two different groups, the train robbers and the people he needs to clean out of the town. The story is fast moving, he has to watch out for Norman Bilinsley, biggest rancher around and his hired hands are Ben's biggest headache. What about Bernard McFadden and Iris McFaddeen???????? With much action and the help of Leon McMannigle he manages to do his job. I agree with another reviewer, that is the reason for the three. The sexual content was a little much for me. I know or think I know the book could have been written with much of that left out. It may help sell books for some people but I buy a western for lot of action with guns and fist, there is that in this book, but the sexual part was a turn off for me."
3,Waxwork,"I remember seeing Waxwork as a kid and I liked it then and like it somewhat now,it is lacking in many things but fun in others,Part 2 I didn't see until now And It seems a bigger spoof and less entertaining,Overall 2 Corny Movies, but the Sequel Is the Worst."
4,GREAT HORROR/COMEDY!!!,"This movie is great!!! My favorite part is the werewolf segment. I liked the ""It's my party"" song at the end. Great gore and humor! A must-see horror film!!!"
3,NOT BAD NOT GOOD,"This movie is alright, its not to bad, but not great either. As for being scary its not ! But in general I think they did an ok job of putting this movie together."
4,Repetitive,"I would love to give this book 5 stars but I just could not do it. Though, I found this book to be very informative I also found it repeating itself (literally). If you took out all the repeated quotes you could probably get rid of at least 50 pages."
3,an homage to Julian Bream,"I didn't enjoy too much this DVD. it's much better the ""music journey through Spain"". but it's not bad at all, just less interesting."
3,Panty fun,These are entertaining to watch her squirm. Always a good time. Good value for couples fun. Shipped quick and discreetly.
1,OMG! Hard plastic! ?,This product is quite harsh to use. The material is a hard plastic. I did not enjoy this at all.
4,"So Far, So Good","I've taken this product for four days now. I've definitely noticed some real digestive changes and changes in physical appearances as well. *I must add I've been taking an organic Colon Cleanse powder* along with this detox kit, so I cannot 100% link the changes just to the Total Body Cleanse, hence 4/5 stars.I've already felt ""lighter"" so to speak, I've been able to wake up less drowsily, I can power through the day a little easier, and I feel less bloated and constipated which were almost every day occurances for me. On top of that, most foods did damage on my stomach one way or another, for no particular reason. That's gone away too...for the most part.I've still got a week and a half to go with the kit. We'll see how it all turns out. So far I have had a lot of runs to the bathroom (though expected), the occasional cramping, bloating, and false alarms, but overall I think once I get all cleaned up inside I'll feel amazing."
2,Didn't notice a thing,"This was the first box cleanse I had ever done, and I am sorry to say I was really disappointed. I didn't feel any more energetic or healthy when the cleanse was over. I followed it pretty closely and supplemented it by eating a diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, grains, and non-meat proteins. It was touted as gentler since it was organic. I didn't notice an increase in bowel frequency, but I did notice them to be a little bit firmer when I had them. After completing the cleanse, I did some research and read that for a cleanse to truly be effective it needs to be at least 1 month long. You can not get significant detox results from a 2 week program."
1,Didnt work,This item did not work. I took it as directed and I got bloated and gassy and constipated. This is the second in this line that I have tried and got the same effect. I will not use this brand again.
1,organic total body cleanse by Renew we all are very unhappyntedted we did not se,We all three in my family did this we are very unhappy with results.We expected to feel energized like we always do after cleansing this time all of us feel very tired and bloated we have no energy.I think we have to drink some wheat grass juice to get going.I really think this a waste of money since none of us got anything good to report.
2,No Movement,"This is my third day on the Organic Total Body Cleanse and I am disappointed. Normally, these types of cleanses loosen things up so that you go to the bathroom more often and things are softer and free flowing. In fact, that's a big part of detox--getting rid of excess waste in the colon. On other cleanses, I would go to the bathroom (BM) 2-3 times a day (once after each meal). This cleanse does nothing for me--at all! Yes, I am drinking a lot of water and eating healthy, but still nothing. The only redeeming factor is the free Cleanse More pills they include in the package. Cleanse More is what really makes things move, but they only have 3 free packets in the box so I'll have to go to the health food store to buy a bottle of this stuff. Bottom line--thumbs down for Organic Total Body Cleanse and thumbs up for Cleanse More."
1,this is lame,"this product does absoluetly nothing!!! it has hurt me, not helped me! my stomach aches, i feel bloated, my breath smells from all the smelly herbs in the capsuls, and i only have one or two very very small movements a day, they were better off before. buy something else."
1,Not for me.,"I bought this product in hopes of cleansing my body before spring. I've always read the best time to do a cleanse is after the winter since your eating habits and exercise aren't always at there best. Today would be my fourth day on the product..but i have decided to quit due to stomach pain, bloating and cramping.I for the most part live a very healthy lifestyle. I am usually very regualar and have no problems going to the bathroom. This product has made it way worse, I do not feel like I'm getting a cleanse at all. If anything it's backing me up. I'm going to quit with the capsules except the fish oil and continue to abstain from alcohol, coffee and continue to eat very healty the next 10 days and hope the results will be favorable. I would suggest that a juice fast may be better than all of these capsules."
1,Pretty useless!,"After reading scare stories about the negative effects of psyllium, cascara sagrada (buckthorn) and senna, I decided to try this cleanser since it doesn't have any ""bad"" herbs in it, but the effect was disappointing. For the first 3-4 days it did absolutely nothing. About the fourth day I felt some slight cramping, and on the fifth day I became constipated. Here I have to add that I only eat raw food, and I am never normally constipated. The constipation was actually caused by the cleanse. There was no changes in elimination besides that, so I felt I was worse off than before I did the cleanse.My husband also tried it, with no effect, until he decided to open the capsules and put the powder directly into water. After that, he did experience some kind of mild cleansing reaction.My own feeling is that this cleanse is basically useless, so don't waste your money."
1,Not worth it,I ended up having to quit half way through because of stomach pain and diarrhea. I wouldn't do it again.
2,Doesn't Work!,"Didn't work for me. I'm five days in and nothing, just nothing! And it's unfortunate, I thought for sure it'd work."
5,to the guy who rated it first,"Send it over to me. These are quality products that work. Obviously you needed less but that is for you to gage and not complain about. Ive had nothing but success with these products. They are well researched, quality ingredients."
5,A Treasure,"The title album is a set of pre-karaoke Riddle arrangements designed for you to sing along with and pretend you're Frank or Ella. Riddle's work is, as always, terrific. Subtle, swinging, beguiling. Good even just for listening.The treasure on this CD, however, is the never-before released LP album ""Hey Diddle Riddle."" It's a collection of nursery rhymes -- The Farmer in the Dell, Three Blind Mice, London Bridge, etc. -- in the kind of utterly captivating arrangements only Riddle knew how to produce.By the way, the notes with this CD are among the best I've ever met for popular music: Riddle's own comments on the song arrangements, and Will Friedman on Riddle in general -- full of information, non-condescending, no gush! -- and some specifics about ""Hey Diddle Riddle."" A real treasure for anyone Riddle fan."
4,The 'Vest-Pocket' Warren Buffett,"This is a great little book that encapsulates the life and investment career of the most widely written about investor in history, Warren Buffett. It is a collection of Warren's wit, wisdom, humor and charm spanning his very successful career as Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. The book is a collection of quotations covering everything from hiring people to his final goal: ""What I want people to say when they pass my casket is, Boy was he old!"" This little book is inspiring, funny and gives insights into what made Warren so successful. The author, Siimon Reynold, ends the book with a basic interpretation of Buffett's rules of investing. I call this book the ""Vest-Pocket"" Warren Buffett. It is an easy read that you'll refer to over and over."
2,Shell the few dollars to get the book if your a Warren fan.,"Hmm. For around 8 beans, you get Warren's quotes. Should you get it? Only if you hang onto every one of his words. Overall, the book was short and all right. Some excellent quotes to take note though."
1,A fifteen minute read,A fifteen minute read of various quotations by Warren Buffett. It ends with a brief summary of his technique. Build a focussed portfolio of shares in businesses you understand. These businesses are growing. Buy when they are selling at attractive prices only. Hold them while they continue growing. Allow compounding and earnings reinvestment to work for you.
5,Pure Chopin.,"The sound of the Pleyel piano really gives new life to this music. Everything sounds so right, so refreshing, and absolutely beautiful. I believe this sound is exactly what Chopin had in mind."
2,"Great intepretation, great play, horrible mix","I'd just like to point out that despite Ms. Boegner's delightfully different way of interpreting Chopin and great playing. This record falls a bit short of listenable for me due to all the footpedal and breathing that's mixed in. While I don't mind ""live noises"" usually, here it just makes the album unlistenable for me. I thought about giving it one star, but the play certainly is excellent, what a shame."
4,Great shows - quality??,"I love the Inspector Morse shows and these are absolutely awesome but I was disappointed in the quality. I'm not a technical expert with dvds and remastering but I immediately noticed that the shows looked like a homemade vcr tape edition. Wasn't the end of the world but a bit disappointing. I bought two different sets and found both the same so I'm guessing the small Canadian company didn't have the same standards as I have come to expect with dvds. Overall, great shows."
5,great show,"great show, excellant product, very good sound and picture, very well packaged, arrived on time, that should cover it all"
3,Disappointing in places,"This collection, with one exception, is passable entertainment. The acting and photography are consistently above average. But the scripts are highly complex and often confusing. The best example of this flaw is ""Service Of All the Dead."" I defy anyone to explain the plot after seeing it. Moreover, the anti-clericalism in the film is extreme and offensive, and the ending is melodramatic and wholly unconvincing. In short, this series on the whole is okay, but when it bombs the explosion tends to make one forget about earlier, more pleasant, programs."
1,Not in correct KEY!,It's difficult to know whether the entire ensemble transposed this classic work of Handel but it seems unlikely. It also seem unlikely that a DDD recording of any work could play in proper tempo at a pitch more than a semitone low. However it's explained; if you care whether the recording accurately replicates the key of the written composition DON'T BUY THIS! It does not.
1,Not Safe For Crabs,This is dangerous to use alone in your hermit crab tank. I was cleaning my tank and found it had hardend like concret at the bottom where my crabs dig to molt. I read up on it on the Hermit Crab Association forum and people have lost crabs because this stuff has concreted around a molting crab and killed it
1,taste bad,This stuff taste bad when I eat it r you guys sure this is fat free sugar ive trying to lose the weight with good and tsty stuff but just tastes horrible :(
3,Grow up Vic!,"I am new to this series so this was the second Solomon and Lord book I have read. I really enjoyed the first book. I found it to be smart and funny which made me want more. Unfortunately I found this story to be a little tiresome due to the amount of text devoted to Victoria's agonizing over her career and relationship with Steve. A little introspection is tolerable but this was dangerously close to taking over the story. And it was disappointingly perdictable that she concluded she loved Steve and would remain a partner in the firm only after he is almost killed (saving her case, I might add). Stop whining and grow up. I am reading book three now."
1,Big Problem!,"I bought this ebook because it sounded really interesting. But, after downloading it, the ebook would not open and froze on my device. I had to delete it after talking to customer support. I'm very disappointed."
5,LOVED IT!,I totally enjoyed reading this book. Steve and Victoria are the proof that opposites do attract. It was easy to follow and I look forward to another in the series.
5,Humorus yet intriguing,First book I have read by this author. I found it very enjoyable. The characters were well done. I will read more books by this author.
4,I LOVE THIS SERIES,"This is my second book read in the Solomon Lord series.The Florida law/comedy stories are well-done.The couple is great and all the characters are solidly drawn, not invisible and weak like some other books.The ending is also solid.Four stars- I'm a hard marker."
4,paul levine novel,"He's not going to win any literary prizes with these, but I hope he's making a nice living. Each is a fun read. Funny is hard."
4,Not Hiaasen but.......,"OK, as a fan of the Florida caper genre, I am forced to compare all to the incomparable Carl Hiaasen.So while Mr. Levine doesn't quite measure up, the novel IS a breezy and pleasant read. The protaganist couple are a likable and believable pair, and the sprinkling of Floridian characters is a tribute to the master. I'm not a big fan the ongoing squabble that is integral (hence the ""VS."" in the title), but the resolution helps.So, go ahead and pick up a Solomon Vs. Lord novel (while your waiting for Carl's next offering.)"
3,Watered down Jake Lassiter,"In this series, Steve Solomon is a basically watered-down version of Jake Lassiter. If that's OK with you, you'll enjoy this one (and its predecessor).The Lassiter novels were so over-the-top, so colorful, so compelling--I guess it's unrealistic to think they could go on forever. Only Ed McBain was able to sustain a series over decades without lapsing into repetition.And Levine is such a likeable writer that I just can't bring myself to criticize him too harshly (except for the abysmal _9 Scorpions_, which we'll just write off as a lapse in taste). Levine is still one of the best writers to come out of the Miami crime genre.This one is certainly a good read--all Levine novels are--but I can't help but miss Jake. The _Solomon vs. Lord_ series just doesn't have that wonderful gonzo element. But keep on keeping on, Paul!"
3,The deep Blue Alibi,"This was a decent book, but not very exciting. It qualifies for late night reading to put one to sleep."
3,Couldn't finish,"This may just not be my kind of book, but I tried to read this, thinking it may take awhile to get involved in it. It didn't happen & after a while I just removed it from my Kindle. The characters just didn't grab me,& I just didn't ""care"" about them or their goals, objectives, etc."
3,Not so good,"After reading Solomon vs Lord I couldn't wait to read the sequel. However I found it dissapointing. It lacked the charm and humor of the first book, nonetheless I am looking forward to reading the third book in the series."
3,"Just alright, no words of praise.","First, I would like to knock at least one star off of this review from Palm for making it so difficult to really see what games were actually on this card.Second, when I finally found out, I was a little disappointed, not by the quality of the games, but the quantity. Of all of the games, I play a couple regularly: Zap 2016 and Solitare.Come on Palm, I am sure that you could have rounded up a few more titles from the vast assortment of free and cheap Palm software to at least make the purchasers feel like they got something. After all, there was more room on the card."
1,Don't waste your money,"1. Most of the programs don't work. They either hose the PDA (m505) forcing a reset, or, in the case of SimCity, just tell you that ""This version of SimCity is unregistered. . The whole reason I bought this card was to get SimCity--the advertising never disclosed that all I got was an icon and a banner advertising a product that I had to purchase separately.2. The card only uses 1.6M of the 16M card, but is write protected so you can't make use of the rest of it--or recycle the card when you realize what's on it is not worth the 1.6M it consumes. Your money is better spent buying a blank 16M card and downloading the same games for free.3. I have been unable to find any support for the card. The Palm web site sends you to the web sites of the individual program suppliers."
5,A good deal!,I have had not problems with the card! The games are good and I tossed the freeware versions I had on the palm.I am surprised at the bad ratings of others. Don't know why they are having problems.This was a good buy for me.
2,Not enough bang for your buck!!,"I had high hopes for the card and the games that were on it. I was disappointed to say the least. If the price was 1/4 of what it is, I'd say buy it. I give it a thumbs down until then for those thinking of buying it."
3,Worth the price,Only about half the games are compatible with my Treo 700p but at $0.50 it was worth tacking on another order.
1,game packs,the games do not work well with the Palm that I purchased. Does not give an option to start a new game in Solitare.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought the game used because i wasn't going to pay the full price for it. I am glad I didn't pay the full price. The game is actually fun when the it is letting you do what you want to do. When trying to lock on you have to be close to your opponent (Fireballs auto lock for the most part). This wouldn't be so bad if the combat field were less chaotic. That leads to another problem. No radar, just an arrow. from a distance it is difficult to tell who is an enemy dragon and who is a friendly. Cut scenes unnecessarily interrupt the gameplay and then throw you right back into the fray with no warning. Combat fields are extremely chaotic at points with you being told to go do many different things at the same time.The game is fun but wait to see if the price goes way down.Pros: Gameplay is fun, cool storylineCons: Controls,"
2,It is as Bad as They Say it is...,"Yes, I wanted it because it was about dragons. Yes, it looked damn cool in the trailers. Yes, it got terrible reviews about the gameplay. Yes, I did not listen, and I regret it. I didn't even go past the fourth mission because I was so frustrated with the controls. Lair makes you draw your attention from the actual game because you are trying to figure out the game controls. It's too sensitive, and when you try to do something it makes you do something else. I was REALLY frustrated!! Not a recommended buy. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!However, the best part of the game (and I really mean it!) is the music. This game has had one of the most epic, and glorious music scored for a video game. If ANYTHING, get the soundtrack!! That is a great investment to your iTunes library. :)"
4,What's with all the gripes? This is a nice and fun game.,"Not a fan of reviews but had to speak up. I agree that the controls take some getting use to, but all in all, this is a fun game which is the bottom line. If you spend the time to get use the controller and controls you'll find that you'll get the hang of it and do quite well. Sure things could be a bit more responsive at times but the same gripes can be said of regular controllers on other games. Come on, how many times have you had a fit of anger with regular controllers during games such as Lost Planet or Resident Evil? Come on! I wanted you to fire to the right! Jesus!! So quit your belly aching and accept new technology to become better player. Everyone, just judge for yourself and rent it or try it at yours friends place."
3,The flying RULES!,"The best part of this game is the flying with the six-axis controller. It is quite intuitive which makes the game very immersive. It works very well most of the time. Turning is a long, slow arc and it's difficult to find a target you were just attacking after one. A solution they put in place is a 180 flip. To do this you yank the controller straight up. Unfortunately, this only works maybe 30% of the time. That leads to a lot of profanity.The graphics are great but the story is lame and it's very repetitive.It does have cool extras like behind the scenes featurettes, music pices and production art.This game can be frustrating because the levels get fairly difficult quickly and it's not always clear what you're supposed to be doing."
5,ever wanted to fly with a dragon? this is for you!,"lair is a excellent playstation 3 exclusive!as part of a ""top Gun"" like elite squadron of dragon riders, you get to ride your dragon through level after of level of flame scortching goodness.the ps3's graphics are incredible..highly detailed and realistic. the Motion controls of the sixaxis controller takes a bit getting used to , but after that it feels second nature.i love that you can shoot fireballs go toe to toe with other dragons..and lots more. if your on the fence about this title grab it. you'll be glad you did."
2,just ok,"Game play is just okay it's hard to get the dragon to do what you want,reaction to controls not reliable, graphics are great. Could have been a great game with more work"
1,Disappointment,This was absolutely the worst game i have ever seen in my life. I bought it and downloaded dlc. I am stuck on some bridge mission where you have to kill like a whole dang army and it is not fun. The graphics are nice but the gameplay and replay value are zero so this game really isn't fun.
2,Disappointed,"Before purchasing this game I read several reviews, but despite several mentioning the controls were difficult I wanted to try it anyway. The graphics on this game are pretty good and the story is interesting, but the controls were indeed an issue. The majority of the game takes place in flight and you control your dragon but tilting and moving the sixaxis controller. Unfortunately, the dragon does not always respond in time to execute your move, and sometimes it doesn't respond at all. Most notably when dodging or trying to do the '180' manuever. Additionally, your dragon is much slower than the enemies you are fighting. I enjoyed the game at first, but as the missions became more difficult the sluggish controls became more of an issue, to the point that playing the game became more aggravating than enjoyable."
3,Lair,"Lair is an action game about dragons. To control the dragons, Lair relied heavily on the user having mastered the Sixaxis function. I hate the sixaxis funciton. I was not able to control the dragon at all. I would tilt the controller one way and the dragon would go the opposite. This really, really frustrated me and ruined the game for me. I could only stand using this feature for about three levels of the game and then gave up on it completely. I would really like to finish the game, it seemed like a great story, but because of the sixaxis feature I may not even bother with the game at all. I tried the game after updating to the version that allows you to use the analog stick, but that is limited and the sixaxis still is the main way of controling the dragon. I don't recommend this game at all unless you like the sixaxis function."
2,Lair,"This game is not a lot fun, it's hard to understand what your supposed to do to get to the next level, I got tired of it and didt't finish it."
2,Failed to deliver,"A disappointment following such great hype from Sony. The SIXAXIS controller required to maneuver the dragon was difficult and not very responsive. Ground control was counter-intuitive too.The graphics at first glance looked impressive, especially on the intros. But a closer look showed a lot of repetitive rendering--something one wouldn't expect to see game designed exclusively for a top-of-the-line console like the PS3.Gameplay was linear with long intros you are forced to sit through each time you wanted to start a level/chapter with no way to skip. Story line was unoriginal and mediocre.I had great expectations for this game...few were met."
4,Graphics aren't so good,"Other reviews say that the graphics are very good but I do not agree... the colors used for landscapes scream at you that this is a game for a new console... Where have you seen a mountain with bright green and hard brown?The controls are very difficult at the beginning, but you'll get used to them after the bridge mission. The history is not bad but won't win any prize if it's written down on a book.Any way, I gave this game 4 stars because it's really fun but only after you master the controls. Burning, slaughtering and eating troops with your dragon is the best feature of this game."
4,This is not a jet-flight-sim,"To those who were expecting a jet flight sim, expect dissapointment. The controls, once you spend more than 15 minutes learning them, behave as one would expect of a dragon rider riding a big creature, and are quite intuitive.Just remember, you are riding a dragon, you are not the dragon. The ""laggy controls"", as some people have said, are expected.. If you don't think so, go ride a horse, see how well he responds..Given ample time to learn the controls, this game is a blast.. If you don't own it, don't plan to own it, owned it for 15 minutes and returned it, too bad for you. A lot of us are enjoying this game quite a bit. The only reason I didn't give it 5-stars is because it suffers the same as a lot of games now days -- too short.."
2,Dissapointing,"Was hoping for a revolutionary game, but it turns out the controls were to convoluted and confusing to really work well and create a fun game. They should have allowed for traditional controls, but rather instead force you to use the ""Six Axis"" controls. It seems many of the reviews of the game coming out are pretty accurate in this respect. I was hoping that the developers would take extra time to fix these issues as they did delay the game; but it seems they didn't have enough time to address these issues. This game could have been great, but is ultimately held back by the restrictive and confusing control scheme. Rent if you're not 100% sure you want this game, as you may not want to spend full price only to find it's not as good as you thought it would be."
5,Excellent resource for those involved with software design,"This book is a great ""tool kit"" for all parties involved in software development. It gives equal time to current methodogies, and offers suggestions for how to create blueprints others can read for application systems, in the same way architects and engineers design a home. Makes complete sense. Great information with rationale behind it."
4,Great Weapon for all levels,"I have had this weapon for a few months now and use it every time I play. I think the power is a little underrated, it shoots around 300fps and is very durable. It shoots perfectly straight and hits hard. I am an experienced player and own over 20 weapons. The only draw back is the limited clip and the fact that i have yet to find any spare clips."
4,Diamond Walnut Purachase,"Have used this poduct for years, despite the bit of extravagance for it is pricy. I found this amounton Amazon and was pleased with the freshness and quality of the walnuts. I would recommendpurchase of extra at this price and store in freezer as I do. They remain perfect for use at any time."
1,Missed the Target,This DVD does not deliver what it promises. It does not give enough detail to do the movements he is doing in the video. He has his hands formed into a weird shape like he has arthritis and that's being kind. There is zero martial arts instruction. Sure I am impressed by his ability but the DVD was a complete waste of money. There are better DVD's out there offering a fusion of martial arts and yoga. Save your time and money.
3,too much voice over...,"not bad, and obviously a seriously dedicated sadhaka, but if you're entry level there`are better and, if more immersed, the follow-up is far better value....buy that instead....still....inspiring...."
3,Interesting but way too fast,"Very creative, interesting DVD, love the wrist and shoulder excercises best. Beginners please stay away from this DVD, the excercises are explain way too fast, what about feeling what your doing so you try to conect to your body and see what the excercise did for you. It feels more like a yogic arts demo rather than an instructional DVD. Please Mr. Duncan you have a great material, but could you slow donw so we can all benefit from your teachings."
5,beautiful and different,"very well produced, beautifully shot, with a unique martial arts approach to yoga: a nice addition to my yoga library"
5,Master yogic arts,Terrific full body workout; You'lll feel inspired mentally and physically after duncan's intelligent process
1,Awakening Rip-off,"What a waste of money and time on this yogic arts dvd.I usually don't like to criticise any product, but I was so hyped about Duncan Wong's yogic arts, that after receiving it I was so..so..disappointed beyond belief. As I was watching this dvd, I couldn't believe my eyes....What exactly is this?It's not yoga! It's not martial arts! What the hell is it?I checked out Duncan Wong's website before purchasing this dvd, and I can tell you that the website and demo's are the opposite of what is on this dvd.The workout has no defined system to follow....it seems like he is in a trance trying to figure out what to do next....What a rip-off...don't buy this dvd"
4,A real eye opener for me,"I found this book very interesting and informative. I read it quickly and learned much from Tony's strategies. However, I found it very convenient that some of his best trades were after hours that provided a huge profit - these were not believable.I do wish that the format he used in the book would be recorded in a similar book with more recent trades. And, I would like to see a variety of sectors to trade rather than only tech and a very few others. Maybe he has already done this.A good read, worth the price, wish it were more recent."
3,"Not Bad, but Very Short","I like the approach that Oz takes in this book - keep it simple! He stresses discipline which is the exact key to trading. However, the book is poorly written (I counted at least 6 spelling or obvious grammatical errors) and very short. I like the diary approach to learning exactly how this trader trades, but it is so brief that I blew through it in 2 nights. There should be much more instruction around the support and resistance and breakout methods he uses. The book was a very good example about keeping a solid sell discipline (especially since he traded long only during a horrendous March-April, 2000)."
5,I recommending this book,My English no so good. I loving this book. Tony Oz making money in bear markets very hard thing for me to do. I needing to learn from him because this book so good. Very excellent tradings in this book. I recommending this book for many people.
2,Close but no Cigar,"Hi Everyone,I brought this book after reading comments and rave reviews on Amazon, but you must read what I have to say before your part with your money. If you have knowledge of basic technical analysis this book is not going to teach you anything new. The book is based on intraday trading tactics which are repeated again and again throughout the book. For example Tony makes numerous purchases on stocks that make intraday double bottoms but uses no other analysis to enter the trade, like intraday moving averages or candle stick patterns (is this how you would enter a trade?). The book is wriiten in font size 16, I read the book in 2 days sitting on the train to Cannon Street on my way to work. I think this is a weak title, if your looking for hardcore stuff that'll make you money check out: 'Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional' This will teach you more than you'll ever need. If you require more information on anything please feel free to write to Email me."
2,Not great quality,"I was disappointed to find numerous small chips in the enamel of most of the items in this set. Yes, they were all on the bottoms of the pieces but I thought Coleman products should not have had any chips at all."
3,"Classic, but chips.","Overall, this set isn't bad for what it's intended.I was disappointed when a cup and plate were chipped out of the box. It was something which happened after it was placed in the box, as the chips/dust were still in the box. Something Coleman could prevent with a little more care in packaging. However, I don't expect that to happen. They're having things made in China for a reason, and quality isn't one of them.I also picked up a red set like this from a local retailer, and it also had a cup and bowl which were chipped.It's nothing a little enamel can't patch up, but it's the point of the matter.The plates are decent size, and work well for camping. They're not huge, but work out well nonetheless.I am only rating this at 3 stars, simply for the packaging issue. It shouldn't be a problem, and Coleman is cutting corners. Personally, I'd rather pay $5 or $10 more, and have their stuff made here in the USA where quality would be better."
5,"Beautiful for entertaining ""camp"" style!","In excellent condition as promised. Speedy delivery too! Love my ""camp"" dishes!The plates are a decent size, and the bowls hold a nice amount of salad. The whole set makes a cute table setting, just add bandanas as cloth napkins!"
2,Chips Easily,For three camping trips these dishes worked quite well but on the forth we noticed that they were chipping all over the place. I guess that's what I get for buying cheap Made in China junk. Next time I'll buy American made.
1,Beware of Backcountry Purchases,"The Coleman 12 piece dining set arrived in a tattered box. The contents inside were in even worse condition. Several of the plates and mugs had significant chips in the enamel paint finish. One of the mugs looked like it had been run over by a lawn mower. The metal rim was completely chewed up, had sharp edges and contained little to no enamel at all. We were very disappointed by the condition of the product and returned it immediately."
2,"Nice history lesson, too bad about the reality.","""More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America."" ... blah blah blah.""Made in China""."
1,I wasted my hard earned money for this book!,"I am a student in Orange County, California. For a beginner, this book doesn't make any sense and gets you very confusing. The code is not explained in enough detail for somebody fresh in this course. I guess the ones that rate this book as beying great, are probably good programmers that know their stuff. But it's a whole different thing when this book is presented to a beginning student. Our instructor's excuse about getting stuck with this book is that the school assigned it to him.Most of the students in my class agree: No more COURSE books for us!"
1,Not for people who already have an idea,"This book does not help you bring your own programming ideas to a reality, it simply has a set of programs and haves you type them out and watch. The small section on textboxes in chapter 2 does not teach a thing. It simply shows that if all you have is a form the textbox will work, but does not get into if you have loaded a form from within a class and then want to get text from the user. OOP should be all about classes. This book fails in this category."
1,I wasted my money,This book is a waste of money. The book is very unhelpful to the beginning programmer. I have programmed various object-oriented languages before and I still found the book to be confusing. The end of chapter exercises frequently ask for things that were not explained in detail in the chapter.
1,This book is confusing.,"I have read numerous programming books, object oriented or not. This one stands out as:1. it's like a step-by-step tour guide that comes with MSVB 6.0 for free, instead of a teaching tool that helps people understand Visual Basic as a whole;2. it's poorly formated, with confusing sectioning of chapters and visually messy code examples (which are too fragmented to demonstrate a point);3. it's industry oriented - if you finally sort out the confusing threads of this book and manage to grasp VB programming, you can produce some real serious industrial strength stuff.In general, I feel this book is useful neither to beginners (as the authors claim) nor to advanced users, nor yet to CS students. If you want to teach yourself VB, don't use this book; if you want a desktop reference, don't use this book; if you attend a course that requires this book, try another course."
1,This book is fragmented and confusing.,"I have been unsuccessful in learning VB from this book. If there is a structured approach to programming then I think there should be a structured approach to learning programming and this book does not have it. I find myself referencing other text books when I want to understand the topic being discussed, or as the authors have us do all to often, the help guide. I will be happy to sell this book back at the end of the semester."
5,Bostin!!!!,"Bought as a present for a friend of ours who is a big fan of ""the black stuff"" He was over the moon with it. I was pleased with purchase and will order from retailer again in the future."
5,Bought this as a Christmas present for my fiance...,....and he just LOVES it! lol VERY heavy duty and stylish too! Perfect edition to his beer collection :-P lol
5,Just the thing for IPA!!,"A great wall-mounted bottle opener for those wonderful thirst quenchers. Heavy duty construction insures a long life and the iconic ""Guinness"" name invokes the flavor of hops and days of old."
2,Form Over Function,Looks great mounted to a stained piece of red oak but performs poorly. The part that's supposed to hook the bottle cap and pull it off as you move the bottle down is too short!
5,catchy beats,"i 1st heard the album back in 1996, from my sister's friend, honestly i thought the cover design's really cool and it looks ""contented"", and i was right! i then went searching around KL to find it and boy, it was expensive! and it's even expensive now! i didn't care much though and bought it. then one stupid accident happened when my sister put the CD in her bag and forgotten abt it, when i found out, the bag was already outside my porch hanging there after the a machine wash... and here i go again, searching for the CD in kl.. n found non."
5,One of the world's greatest mezzos,"Von Stade has a voice made of emotion. Her Cherubino (you can hear it on Solti's recording of Le Nozze) is simply THE BEST that there is, so it's vital that they included her ""Non So Piu"" on this CD - a very interesting arrangement, too, with violin. Not so good as with orchestral accompaniment but still it's nice. Now, I bought this CD for the Mignon gavotte and was not dissapointed. The notes are light and airy. Her voice compliments the natural beauty of the music. Equally gorgeous was the Massinet and oh! The Offenbach is wonderful. It drips with Von Stade-ness. I've heard Anne Sofie Von Otter sing the same aria and she seemed to overdo the comic aspect of it - although I am aware that after all, it is Offenbach. But my philosophy is play it straight and the funniness will shine through. Anyway, this is an excellent CD. Every piece on it is a gem. If you want a good sampling of a great singer, try this CD!"
5,Contemplative Commentary,"A skillful weave of scholarly knowledge with practical advice for nourishing authentic prayer. Matthew's gospel presented as story, with plot, characters, and dramatic movement. Describes historical setting, literary characteristics, and the probable author. Attempts to use the gospel narrative as a resource for prayer experiences. Discusses simple, sacred reading, imaginative contemplation, and scriptural sharing. An ideal book for undergraduate or high school Bible class or for study groups of any kind."
4,Marvellous,"The book is wonderful! Reach in picture and well structured. There is little research, but i'm proud i've bought it. It's really useful to my study."
1,Wonderful!,"My first reaction to this book was who reads this trash. Than after I read it, my throbbing heart nearly ruptured with vomit. I have a mental picture of this big sexy fat woman with potato chip grease on her hands writing this novelty. Am I write?If you don't want to read the story read the back cover or three pages and you will know it. The main character, who we will call Tim, becomes a secretary to be a shameless capitalist republican. She goes to a funeral with brother and meets Dylan, the guy with a 90210 name, how cute? Would Dylan look past her greed? Or course he would, it's a Christian romance novel!"

4,"NOT HER BEST, BUT STILL VERY GOOD!","I think it is terrific that Sandra Brown was writing books like this ten years ago. I wish I had discovered her then. This isn't my favorite by her,but it was not bad. I'm always amazed that Ms. Brown can tackle subjects that upon reading the back cover I believed I wouldn't like. She is a master at writing about controversial situations and relationships in a tasteful way. I love everything I have read by this author(with the one exception of ANOTHER DAWN),but my favorites by her are ""TEXAS LUCKY"", ""TEXAS CHASE"" AND ""TEXAS SAGE""."
1,Didn't like the abridged audio tape version!,"I bought the abridged audio tape because I like the actress who reads it, I have seen her on several different soap operas and TV guest appearances and I have always though that she was a good actress but I'm disappointed with her reading of this book she sounded flat and unemotional and used the same voice for each character and I like it when they use different voices for all the different characters so I was just not happy with the audio tape at all and promptly gave it away! I see the unabridged audio tape version is read by someone else but since I didn't like the abridged tape version I definitely will not buy the unabridged tapes!"
1,THE WORST,"This by far is one of the worst books that I have read. The characters are unlikeable. Who really talks like that. The story line was sappy. The relationship started much too fast and went downhill from there. This was the first Sandra Brown book that I read and I'm not sure if I want to read another. Hopefully, all of her books aren't this bad, because I did buy another one. Please Sandra, be more realistic next time."
2,"Lame, Lame, Lame!","I really was not impressed by this one. I am a huge Brown fan, but what was she thinking?The main heroine was boring and a little wierd if you ask me. The whole story was really annoying to me."
5,My First Love,"I may be partial, because this was my first. Breakfast in Bed was my introduction to Mrs. Brown, and I was HOOKED. So this book holds a special place in my heart (and in my collection too.) I have three categories of Sandra Brown books...C) Why did I buy this? I'll give it awayB) Nice read, I'll loan it outA) Sorry, you can't borrow it because I'm about to read it AGAIN!This one is an ""A"" lister. Yes, you may question what kind of friend Sloan is, but in the end, it won't matter and all will be forgiven. These characters have great chemistry and this is a great story, one where the end will not leave you flat. In fact, if you like it, pick up `Send No Flowers' when you're done. For those of you who like a good love story, especially a steamy love story, this one's for you. Run out and buy it today, I got it for less than $5. ...and it is definitely worth owning!"
5,A constistently good easy read,Sandra Brown writes another great novel. It never drags although it is a little predictable it is still a good escape.
5,exc read,"Breakfast in Bed by Sandra BrownSloan runs a bed and breakfast and allows single women and couples, not single men. Except her best girl friends soon to be husband, Carter will be staying there, finishing his novel then onto his wedding with Alesha.She helps him in writing his book, acting out scenes and things heat up over time and they wonder how they will be able to explain to Aleshi that they couldn't be wed.She doesn't want to continue with his advances but he's becoming very forceful.Due to the weather everyone has cancelled for the weekend. This means she will be in the B+B with just him, but then her girl friend calls and she is coming up to visit as Carter in his calls to her seems distant."
2,nautica towel bleeds,"This towel is big and soft, but the first time I took it to the pool the red nautica lettering got wet (of course!) and bled red to all surrounding areas. I washed the towel a couple times in cold water and got most of it out, but it's still kind of pink all around the lettering. I mean, it's a towel! It's supposed to get wet!"
1,DON'T BUT IT,"I spilled a glass of water on the towel- which shouldn't be an issue seeing as the purpose of a beach towel is to dry off a wet person. However, the red dye from the ""nautica"" on the corner immediately bled all over the towel. So now I have a half pink/half white towel with a distorted looking ""nautica"" printed on the bottom. What did they spray paint the nautica and symbol on the towel or something?"
1,SHOP ELSEWHERE!!!,I HATE Amazon. I have ordered approx 6 items from them directly and 4 of them have been wrong or the orders canceled altogether.
1,A REALLY TERRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS POORLY WRITTEN, HAS THE GUY NEVER HEARD OF SPELL CHECK. I AM THINKING THAT THIS MUST BE PUBLISHED BY A KIND OF VANITY PRESS. I HAVE MORE ADVENTURES AND BETTER STORIES THAN THIS PERSON. TELLS YOU NOTHING THAT YOU DID NOT ALREADY KNOW, GIVES ADVICE LIKE CHECK YOUR LOCAL SENIOR CENTER, REALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA TO WRITE MY OWN BOOK, WHICH WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AND GIVE SOME ACTUAL PLACES TO TRY....A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, WILL TRY TO RESELL IT ON AMAZON."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"THIS IS TRULY A BAD BOOK. I LOOKED THE PUBLISHER UP AND ITS A VANITY PRESS, IN OTHER WORDS A PAID FOR BY THE AUTHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT GOT ON AMAZON. ITS RAMBLINGS OF AN OLDER GENTLEMEN ABOUT VARIOUS DATES HE HAS HAD IT THE PAST. ITS CLEAR HE DOES NOT HAVE SPELL CHECK. I THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF HINT OF DIFFERENT THINGS HE TRIED, OTHTER THAN TRY YOUR LOCAL SENIOR CENTER.....A TRUE WASTE OF MONEY, I AM SELLING MINE ON AMAZON. IT HAS INSPIRED ME TO WRITE MY OWN BOOK, WHICH WILL BE SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER AND HAVE SOME GOOD INFORMATION."
2,They work but no support,"These work ok, but if you need just one side forget it. The company only sells the pairs. They don't fit well. I won't buy them again."
2,Disappointed,The usual SyFy made for TV fare. I didn't watch much of it because I'm hearing impaired and all I could do would be watch. I really thought that since The SyFy Channel has such a good track record of providing closed captioning with their broadcasts that a DVD with their name on it would have CC. NOPE! NO CLOSED CAPTIONS!
5,Fantastic presentation,"I first became interested in the Brooklyn Bridge from having watched part of a presentation on the History Channel. The building of the Brooklyn Bridge was an amazing feat considering the equipment available to workers more than 120 years ago.I read the book ""The Brooklyn Bridge"" first and then bought and watched the DVD. The combination of having read the book and then watching the DVD made it all come alive with the characters and time. The DVD is a fantastic presentation of the design and building of the Brooklyn Bridge."
3,Brooklyn Bridge - An engineering marvel!,"There are many engineering marvels in the world and the Brooklyn Bridge is certainly one of them. This hour long DVD focuses on the design and construction of this great bridge, but misses some of the interesting details that I have seen in other DVD historys on the same subject. But for the price I am glad to have it in my collection of engineering marvels."
4,"I like this album, but it's not as good as the others.","It's good album, but the track sounds like as if they were rushed, it's lacking something. There's little variety, don't get me wrong it's a good album. But not as good or varied as their earlier works."
3,xD? why...,"I'm not sure what Fuji was thinking when they came up with this format, sure it was tiny, but SD is small enough and we really don't need a dozen different flash media formats. I bought this to work with a Smart Media adapter (another format I'm glad to see go away) to go into my wife's electronic piano (I wish they had gone with something like compact flash, no need to miniaturize the media when your talking about a piano). So I give the product 3 stars... It works, but if you can avoid this format than please do."
4,hi im a kid who read this book,:) i liked this book a lot i recomenned it for younger readers around the age of 6-10 i think they would realy enjoy it.
5,Excellent product!,"Dickies brand has been a long-time favorite for us. My husband LOVES these T-shirts and rather than traipse from one store to another only ""hoping"" to find them for him, I ordered them from Amazon.com. These are 99% cotton; seemingly hugely oversized to begin with, but they will shrink ... as with any product made with a high percentage of cotton. After the first washing/drying, these fit my husband perfectly.As always, service from Amazon was great and the package arrived sooner than expected."
1,I don't think these are Dickies,"This is my first review. I've been wearing Dickies t-shirts for around 20 years. These are not Dickies. The iron-on collar tag is already worn off, they don't fit true, and are entirely too stretchy. I am still wearing shirts that are 6 years old, and they still have the tags. I also just ordered two new shirts from Dickies and they have changed their tags again. I wore them for a few months and I am now throwing them away. Just not comfortable. Save yourself some trouble and order directly from Dickies."
5,Good quality,"My husband has worn Dickies T-shirts for years, but they are getting more & more difficult to find (we live in a remote area). I enjoy the convenience of ordering online and he enjoys having his favorite t-shirts."
4,Dickies 2 pack T-Shirts,"My husband has been wearing Dickies T-Shirts for a very long time. I was glad to find this 2-pack, however they are not exactly the same shirts I have been buying individually. They shrink a little more, so if buying these, you may want to buy up 1 size. They are still good quality shirts."
5,Dickie T Shirt Two Pack Great deal,Recently I ordered the Dickie T-shirt twin pack from amazon and I am happy with my order. The shirts are great quality and I will be buying more.
2,Not for the Kindle,While I've used the printed version and felt it was worthy of the price the Kindle E version I downloaded had all of the recipes stripped from the content. Very disappointing.
5,Very good How-To,"This is not a networking or Cisco primer. This book assumes that you have a task to accomplish, then gives explanations and examples to help you accomplish them. It's extremely helpful when you have an idea of what needs to be done and need help with specific configurations.If you know how to create and administer Cisco networks but sometimes need outside help when unfamiliar situations arise, then this book can be that assistance."
4,Condon a winner,"I must confess a slight bias - we all know Thomas Condon as one of our foremost geologists. I, however, was lucky enough to know him as my great grandfather. Well, not know him - he died well before I was born - but I knew of him. Intimately. And now the common reader has the same opportunity! On the whole the book captures my great grandfather perfectly - but there are a few omissions. If the anecdotes my parents' entertained their eleven children with are true, Thomas Condon spent more time with women than involved in women's suffrage; more time in prison than involved in prison reform. But, bygones - on the whole, a job very well done and I recommend this book heartily for those interested in the pacific northwest, geology, reform, and/or irish americans."
3,Enjoyable but sometimes patchy,"As a geology major with a focus on the Pacific Northwest, I couldn't help but come in contact with Thomas Condon in many of the books I was reading for courses. I then decided to learn more about him by reading his biography. I have to say I was stunned to learn the details of his life before he began missionary work! Who knew?! Still, this book does a decent job of documenting the highs and lows of Condon's life as it related to his work as an educator. I was, however, a bit disappointed with its lack of coverage regarding his involvement with women's suffrage - maybe, contrary to public belief, this wasn't one of his major focuses? Overall, it was an enjoyable (if sometimes patchy) read."
2,Not quite what you get,"I ordered this charm because it looks like a Siamese cat, but the one I received is much less detailed. It still is obviously a cat, but did not match the picture."
2,very disappointing,"Good idea shame about the direction!The films look fantastic but the director decided to show large chunks of the scenery at very fast speeds leading to a combination of bewilderment, motion sickness and real disappointment. The director/producers are idiots."
4,A review of Doctorow segment only Pleasant,"E.L. Doctorow comes to talk about his novel 'Waterworks'. It is set in nineteenth century New York. Rose mentions that Doctorow's novels set in different times and places in the history of the City seem to constitute a special kind of history of it. Doctorow who appears very staid and calm says that this did not happen intentionally. He speaks about his own artistic process in which the artist follows and shapes what emerges, not what is strictly planned. Doctorow appears somehow more sombre than I had imagined him. Rose asks him questions which not always relaly connect with his intention and direction in thought. It turns out he was named after Poe, and that Poe has had a shaping hand in this fiction. Doctorow suprises by not having brilliance or hunger as part of his personality. This is a pleasant segment."
4,Worst program ever?,"This program is NOT a graphics program, it's a flow charting program. If you want a graphics program stick with Adobe, Jasc, or other related products. If you want a comprehensive flow charting program with ease of use, stick with Visio. I've used it for 8 plus years and found to be a valuable business tool.Because Microsoft purchased the product, then bumped the price up by 100%, I'm forced only give it four stars due to the cost.I bought the orginal program for under $50 when it first came out."
4,sticky,"bought these for the wife so she could stick up her picturs while she scrap books. she likes em and likes it how they are colorful and interesting, not just boring old magnets."
1,Worthless for anything but thin paper,"These magnets are fine for holding thin pieces of paper and that is about it. I threw them away because they were so weak. I suppose if you wanted to use them to make dot-designs or something on your appliances, they might be worthwhile. Besides that, skip it."
1,"Package was ripped, magnets are scratched","The package the magnets came in was ripped to shreds (the plastic package, not the box the item shipped in) and the magnets are all scratched up & chipped. This item should be marked used. Very unprofessional packaging & poor quality item. Buyer beware."
2,breaks easily,"The magnets are pretty weak, I need to use at least 2 to hold up a sheet of paper on the fridge. And if you happen to drop one, they will crack off and break. Very cheap product."
2,they're ok...,the plastic covers on the magnet are pretty thin/cheap. A couple have dropped to the floor and chipped. Probably should have shopped around a little more.
1,Magnets poor,Magnets have no power and cannot be used for purpose. Very disappointed. Ttied using to hold pictures on refrigerator and they didn't have power to stick and hold.
3,"Used, but they still do the job.","This item was said to be new, however, they had clearly already been used. But either way, they are still in good condition. Thank you!"
4,Extremely absorbent but does not stay in place,"Although this product has a thin adhesive strip and needs to be readjusted before and after EVERY feeding, its really absorbent and prevents leakage."
3,McQueen Puzzle review,The graphics on the puzzle are great. The blocks are the perfect size for small hands (4 yr old ). I purchased this for my nephew; it is a little much for him right now. The puzzle has six sides and the color sceem is VERY similuar on all sides. So it is a little difficult for him to put the puzzle together by himself. All in all it is a very unique gift. No one will duplicate this gift; of all the Disney Pixzar CARS products this is one no one will see coming.
1,Not Good Service,I ordered this book for class and paid for it to be expedited. It took about a week and a half for me to receive it. I ordered through other companies and I received my book in less than three to four days. I will give them credit though the book was in good condition. This company is okay if you aren't in a rush to receive your item.
3,surprise,"This was the first book I read by this author, and I was very impressed. I bought the book for an assignment and I was worried it would be cheesy. In the end I enjoyed the book. I thought the topics were great and needed to be exposed."
2,What is she grumbling about?,"What I hate about books like this one is that the main character is a girl of average height and size who can't stop complaining about how horrible her body is. So what if she's not tall and skinny like model-like Nadine? So what if she hasn't got a figure of 8 like sexy Magda? When reading this, normal young girls with perfectly healthy, normal bodies may feel that there is something wrong with their figure, and that they too should be worrying like Ellie does or going to extreme measures to lose weight..."
2,Girls Under Pressure,"This isn't the best book in this series. The entire time you get to listen to Ellie moan and complain about her weight- yet the second someone sticks food under her nose she can't seem to help herself. Shouldn't she have a little more willpower?Wilson turned Ellie into a mean, argumentitive character. I understand what she was getting at- that not eating enough was making Ellie's temper suffer- but I really don't care to read a book where the main character is such a baby.I did buy the other books in this series, which I thought were an improvement on this one."
3,Eh. Mediocre at best.,"Being a fan of the rest of the books in the series, I couldn't wait to read GIRLS UNDER PRESSURE. I knew this book would deal with Ellie's battle against her weight, but it was a bit of a letdown.Ellie is upset that both her friends are gorgeous and thin, and she's on the shorter, stockier side. She also thinks she's ugly, and her way of dealing with this is simple - lose weight by dieting. Of course, the diet goes out of control and soon she's in a serious battle with anorexia.My least favorite part of the book is the fact that nobody realized Ellie's problems sooner, and the fact that Ellie befriended an incredibly anorexic girl, without realizing that she was in the same condition. It's a good book, but GIRLS UNDER PRESSURE is probably the worst in the series.Overall grade - C"
2,Not that good,"I would not recommend buying this. If you are extremely bored and just looking for a way to pass the time, I suggest checking it out from the library. I have read the first three ""Girls"" books and this is my least favorite... The characters aren't very likeable in my opinion in any of the books, frankly, they are all way too self centered and just annoying. And the ending seemed like it was cut too short, and not an accurate portrayal of an eating disorder. An anorexic/bulemic doesnt just suddenly decide that she doesnt want to end up that way and simply go eat, its not that easy. I am disappointed in this series and will not waste my time or money on the 4th book."
5,"It's simple to absorb this engrossing, realistic story","Ellie's encounter with a modeling contest does more than challenge her friendship with her best friend: it shows her that she weighs too much and is in need of some serious dieting. Suddenly life becomes a big effort to avoid food at all costs: even newcomers to Jacqueline Wilson fiction writing will find it's simple to absorb this engrossing, realistic story, which also encompasses Ellie's parents' reaction."
5,Can't hear it,A wonderful Christmas gift. Perfect picture. Got all ready to enjoy the whole set. But unfortunately I need closed-captioning to view the DVD and I discovered that this set did not have it. I'm extremely disappointed because Morse was one of my favorites (Guess I heard better in those days) Anyone know if there are Morse DVDs with CC?
5,Inspector Morse: Always Right On Time,"I have always enjoyed watching the Inspector Morse mysteries on PBS and A&E. However, A&E has changed a once vibrant, artistic format to garbage, plain and simple. Since the death of John Thaw, the actor who portrayed the melancholy Inspector Morse, even PBS has ceased to show these wonderful dramas. Thank God for Amazon, because now I can continue to purchase my favorite Inspector Morse mysteries and thoroughly enjoy them again as well. Thank you!!!"
4,Perfect Timing,I was worried that the video would not make it for the party but it came in the nick of time.
2,Inspector Morse collection bought from Amazon,we are big fans of Inspector Morse and looked forward to receiving the series. The first tape is flawed and the show interrupted. I am disappointed in Amazon; I paid more to buy the series from Amazon rather than a third party so am doubly disappointed.
3,Not the best effort,"I liked Scott Krippayne's More album, but it is nothing when put up against is previous effort, Wild Imagination, and his third album, Bright Star, Big Sky... The sophomore effort usually suffers, but I'm glad to hear that Mr. Krippayne has gotten back to real instruments, and sound song writing in the third album."
2,Could have been better . . .,"This book had a lot of information, to it's credit. I found quite a bit of material that seemed to be copied right out of the Visual Basic 6 help documentation. Also, I was disturbed to find I was reading multiple paragraphs over again, because they were repeated in the book verbatim multiple times. I found the DAO/ADO sections, to be useful, but no the ODBC sections. I also found a few (less than 5) coding errors."
2,Fell Short,"I enjoyed the overview but the book rushed through a lot of details when I read through the ADO portion. Also much of the code did not compile until I fixed a few things, all in all dissapointing. Sam's VB Database Programming Guide was a much better book."
1,Everyone strikes out now and then,"I'm a fan of Higgins, and his Kennedy series. This entry, however, is not at all representative of his work. The dialogue takes tangents from tangents. Skip it."
5,Awesome!,"This sweet valley was really good, considering whats going to happen to the twins and their family. Liz and Blue and Salvador have a little love triangle, kind of strange but this book is REALLY REALLY good, You should read it!"
4,An enchanting tale,"This book was brief but, to me, very satisfying despite a flaw or two. The book is based on Norse and Scottish folk ballads and myths (e.g. Hugin and Munin, Odin't two ravens, make a couple of appearances).It's written in a lyrical way, reading very much like those tales and myths as they would have been told by some bard at a feast in a great house. Yet in the case of the two youngest characters, you do get into their heads and their experience quite thoroughly. The characters feel much more sympathetic and real than Farmer's characters did.There was the occasional weak point, like the swiftness with which the prince solved his personal problem, or the blank spot where the reader wanted to witness a long-sought family reunion. Those weren't minor, and the book is weaker because of them.But on the whole, I really loved the book, and for the most part, it was an enchanting tale."
5,Pure magic... wonderful!,"This story is beautiful. It is pure magic... a wonderful book, from the very first word. It is so easy to imagine ones self living out the lives of the principal characters; a gem."
1,"Bad Writing, had good potential though","The plot was intriging and original, but the writing is something quite horrid to read. Nothing lyrical or beautiful or magical about the story came up, due towards the unflattering writing style. The writing was very unapealing. Maybe an English course for the writer will spice up her next book!"
1,dissapointing,"The plot of this book seemed so impressing and original, so I had expected a good read, put finished the book unfulfilled and wishing I hadn't read it. From the first chapter, you could tell that this was one of those books with ""unlyrical"" and bad ""word"" usage on the pages. Sentence forms were dull, there was nothing to use to imagine the green beautiful scenery that was on the cover."
1,Just Bored me to Death,"How much worse could a book get than this? The writing was so dry and untasteful, and the design of the book was putrid.If you'd like to read a bad book read this, if you're looking for a good one, look else where, anywhere else."
2,Not as good as American clips,I ran out of my old American butterfly clips. These Chinese clips are made with an inferior steel that are less springy; they clamp less strongly and bend out of shape easier than the old American brands. Springy steel must cost more?
3,Land Of The Giants: Flight Of Fear,"For any Irwin Allen's ""Land Of The Giant"" fan, this is a must read! The wonderful storylines of the first episode's of this epic, ground-breaking scifi show from the 60's brings all the wonder and awe of this show flooding back! And, despite the fact that the show is out on DVD, sometimes, it's just better to read the adventure than to view it again. Plus, there's an added character that was not brought onto the show, that after reading the role this character plays in the survival and character-development of the castaways, actually might have added an extra spark to the actual show if the original script(s) had been developed. A must buy for all Land Of The Giant's fan!"
2,Readable Coffee Table Book,"Its only a fairly average book. If you want a change from your favorite author once in a while, this maybe a good change.PROS- The pace of the book flowed quite quickly.CONS- Not enough fresh was being put into the main characters, especially in terms of their postings and empowerments in the SIS(Having read some other reviews, I am not sure could this be due to the inadequate knowledge of the author).- As the plot was supposed to be related to banking, more details should have been given to the industry to educate the readers. Again, this is lacking.- Change of scene was not being done smoothly, leaving the readers confused.- Plot was too predictable.There was a sub-plot that was only revealed at the last few page which i believe was meant to be the final ""suspense"" (Not very impressive).CONCLUSIONI will give it a 2 star as its still readable."
2,Worst case of editing I have even seen,"Not only are parts of this story farfetched, the editing is terrible. One character is said ""to be in her late thirties."" A few pages later her father is said ""to be in his late forties."" Two women are said to be cousins and a few pages later are half-sisters. Is Colin Forbes getting too old to write or as a well-known author his manuscripts are not carefully edited?"
3,Plenty of action but not much else,"Paula Grey and Deputy Director of the SIS Tweed are on their way to Hengitsbury Manor, a weird area to house the headquarters of the Main Chance Bank. It is a completely independent bank with no shares on the Stock Exchange and controlled by a woman called Bella Main. Indeed the government thinks that there is something funny about that bank. So Tweed and Paula are on the outlook for money-launderers, terrorist funds and robbery proceeds and they're quite surprised when Bella Main announces that billionaire Calouste Doubenkian, an oil magnate from the Balkans, offers a huge sum to buy the Main Chance.The tension starts building up when Paula and Tweed are missed but for a few inches by a massive left-hand caterpillar track revolving like a terrible machine just as they are about to approach Hengitsbury Manor..."
3,beauty,"This books pictures are very beautiful, but the information we already know about diet and exercise. This book is nice to look at but highly priced."
1,What ? Is that Bo Derek on the cover?,"This book would never have made it to press had it not been for the fact that India Hicks is the granddaughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten and 2nd cousin to Prince Charles. Can we talk? The book is pure drivel. All of the information contained in this airy-fairy, pseudo-aristocratic, jet-setty, new-agey book has been written about for years. Such pearls of wisdom as: Get enough sleep. Drink lots of water. Please, spare me. While this could have been a classy book, naked photos of India Hicks, made it lose my vote. I guess I'm an old ""prude"", but if you are connected to the Royal family, keep your clothes on."
5,It Glows,"I compared Merlet's performance with that of Kathryn Stott, especiallythe last Nocturne, #13. Merlet's has more tragedy and bite, call it pathos. Stott's( as well as JP Collard's) are likewise amazing. Other pieces here ripple amaziingly. Theme and Variations is great.This is an oft played CD, it has lasted well, very enjoyable."
2,Have not received the item,I ordered the item 11/19 and have not received it yet. I know it said may not received before Christmas. This is my review at this time.
5,K&N Air Filter,Installed easily in my '07 Vette and has returned noticable better fuel economy. Have no way to substantiate extra power.
1,returned it,the 2 filters for my corvette were so drenched in oil that i was afraid they would screw up the mass air flow sensor
3,Just okay!,"This book had great potential.. but was just okay! Found the situation with the mother-in-law unrealistic. At the end of the book there is a twist in the plot, thought that the way Constantino handled it was far fetched."
2,Bad Buy,"I bought a new computer with the highest speed available to do video work. I talked to several people at different stores to find the best capture card I could find for a PC. Most recomended Avermedia DVD ezmaker. It hooked up easy and pretty much worked out of the box, but the bundled software was very lacking. I decided to upgrade from Ulead studio 7 Se to Ulead studio 8 and found out it won't work with anything but 7SE. EZmaker pro led me to believe it was as good as any other pro video capture devices for the PC. Wrong. No one doing video work as a pro would want something that can't use better software than came with the capture device. So if you want a capture device that you can't use with anything but what came with it and pay a premium price for it as well this is it. If you can't use programs that have more and better features even from the same software company you are buying something that is obsolete right from the box."
1,Not a video capture card?,I bought this product thinking that I could plug my analog camcorder right into my USB port and capture the video that way. No such luck. Then I read on their website that you need an analog capture card to do such a thing. So what exactly is this product supposed to do? Any help would be appreciated.
3,think before buying,"The quality of capturing is decent.But there are several problems with this devise and bundled softwares.It works with not all computers - perhaps you need really very high quality and stable comp.Caturing devise in my comp works only with bundled Ulead DVD software. I can't use other softwares like Nero, Dr Divx, Virtual Dub, Blaze, etc.As far as Ulead DVD software is concerned its quality, in my opinion, is less than for example Nero and others. It has a little option - once it set up for one region, e.g. US it will burn only in NTSC.Technical support of Avermedia is bad."
4,Works Pretty Well,"This product has worked pretty well for me. I've read many bad reviews for other similar products so I was careful when I picked out this one. The software seems stable and had no problems with the audio being out of sync.I have not been able to find the manual on the install CD but haven't looked too hard.If you're looking for an inexpensive product to move your vhs tapes to dvd, this is it!"
2,Looks nice but...,"The package and case for the device looked real nice. I tried to set everything up and it appeared to be ok except for a slight delay in audio between what I heard on the tv and what I heard on my laptop. However, after watching a recording that lasted longer than 15 minutes I noticed the audio was out of sync. I could not uderstand why, my machine more than excedes the minimum requirements. It seems to be a common problem with similar devices."
3,Literary Theory More Than Socio-Historical Analysis,"I had hoped this book would provide a good social history of power and gender in the Victorian period. It does provide some insights, particularly into the class system, whereby the upper classes engaged in discrete and ""genteel"" marital coercion, while open displays of physical abuse were associated with the working class. The author does mention some of the legal reforms in the period. However, she spends most of her time on subtle textual analysis of some of the novels of the period, such as ""The Woman In White"" by Wilkie Collins. She applies concepts of the fashionable European theorists, such as Foucault. And she draws conclusions for today, including a defense of Lorena Bobbitt. Bottom Line: If you are an English major or Womens's Studies major interested in literary theory, you will find this book well written. If you are a History, Sociology, or Law major, this text will be of peripheral value."
2,overrated,"I bought this book believing the hype perpetuated by Nobel Prize winners and famous newspapers. In a nutshell, they were wrong. This book starts with a lot of promise, but Silver begins to get irrating around the fifth chapter. He moves away from the real science and goes overboard with goofy scenarios. Much of what Silver writes sounds like it appeared on Oprah. This book isn't exactly a waste of time, but there are better choices out there."
2,Paid by the Word...,"A biologist at the end of his useful life flirts with NYT reporter Gina Kolata and jumps into the limelight to praise cloning. Pow, bing, boom he's...a bioethicist! This is what happens when narrow, mindless molecular genetics folks try to write scholarly books rather than running gels. Silver mouths simple platitudes about politics and ethics, basically claiming that everything new is good. Even worse though is his science: ""it is safer to clone than to reproduce naturally because the correct number of chromosomes is guaranteed."" Brilliant! Not. This isn't courage, it is profiteering. There isn't a careful or original idea in this book. But at least our biologist has found a way to stay at Princeton!"
1,Weak,"It says in the bio the writer teaches at Princeton, but based on the writing, listless and without a compelling narrative, I can only hope the gentleman works as a subsitute teacher, rather than someone fully tenured. For a far more gripping story, both in information and narrative style, read MERCHANTS of IMMORTALITY. Science writing at it's very best!"
5,Perfect transaction!,I received the book only a few days after I ordered it and it was in great condition. Thanks.
5,Exactly as advertised,"Just a perfectly sized tote bag for a picnic or soccer game or whatever. It will see a lot of use when the weather warms up a bit, and will probably see a few road trips before then. Good quality bag, too - about what you'd expect from Coleman."
5,Great source for books,The book was a great find. It was in great condition and a bargain. I'll be back.
1,Defective,"I was immediately disappointed that this product was made from particle board. While the product description indicates that it has a wood laminate finish it does not say that underlying the laminate is particle board. The laminate is pretty obvious and makes the cabinet look cheap. Nevertheless, it was relatively inexpensive and I needed it so I decided to put it together. The instructions were not the best, but I managed to construct it. After it was built I set a ream of paper in the top drawer and while opening and closing this drawer half of the drawer cover simply came off. I can no longer open the top drawer the the front of it is just hanging off. Poorly designed, cheap looking, cheap materials, bad instructions, etc. I also bought a desk from the same seller with very similar results/quality."
2,misleading,"Be aware that this product is 90% sawdust and glue and that the actual wood is only on the outside. And, it comes with three bags of hardware for assembly. I also suggest that you ship the styrofoam back to the manufacturer. Why do they feel a need to use something that can't be recycled where there are plenty of alternatives. Good luck!"
3,"OK, if you're carful.","Very time comsuming to assemble. Veneer is easy to scratch. Bottoms are very weak - only designed for hanging folders - so if you want to use one drawer for storage, you have to strengthen the bottom. But once assembled, unit looks good and functions well."
5,Great Book on the Holy Spirit,Dr. Larry Pettegrew is to be praised for his book on the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the context of the New Covenant. Dr. Pettegrew does a great job of not only teaching on the ministries of the Spirit but he gives hundreds of Scriptures for his points. He deals with nearly every possible work in the new covenant from coversion to glorification.If you are a Charismatic you may not fully agree with all that Dr. Pettegrew writes concerning the Spirit but nonetheless he will cause you to biblically think about the Holy Spirit and remain committed to biblical truth (1 Timothy 4:16; Titus 2:1).
1,More (...junk) from Bob Klein,"Waited a while for this tape, should have canceled it when I saw how bad his Chinese Kickboxing tapes were. Poor technical demonstrations, poor instructor comments. His demos of internal strength are terrible. This was made in 1987 however."
2,Poor manufacturing control,"The crown fell off on receiving the product, so I had to return it. The bracelet is composed of folded links instead of solid links, and it is somewhat cheap-looking overall."
5,love it!,"bought for my daughter, who is 20, one of her favorite movies! Came very quickly, in time for Christmas."
3,An OK Christmas Movie,"This movie is for kids, but a bit juvenile for adults. However, Jessica Biel, even in her teen years, is very hot!! Her backside fills out those tight jeans very well!"
4,Great Funny Chistmas Laughs,This was a very funny Christmas movie. Its great to get in the mood for the holidays. It has a very funny cast of characters with a kind of hoaky plot but still it was fun to watch.
1,"It's No ""It's a Wonderful Life""","I thought this movie sent many wrong messages - abandoning someone in the dessert, lying about volunteering at children's hospitals, delivering donor organs, etc. to get what one wants, the materialism of the quest of a Porshe, handing out stolen merchandise to children, the list goes on and on! I can see how this movie would be appealing to teenagers but I do not think this sends the right Christmas message."
1,Bah humbug!,"""I'll be home for Christmas"" stars former child star Jonathan Taylor Thomas. JT2 is a teenaged boy who'd rather not go home for Christmas to be with his family, since his father remarried 10 months after his mother died (if this were Shakespeare,he'd be bemoaning that his father would be warming the marital bed while his mother is barely cold in her grave) His father bribes him with a Porsche- in the spirit of Christmas giving.As if an answer to his prayers, JT2 gets beaten up by bullies&stranded; in the desert in a Santa outfit. Jessica Biel has a thankless role as JT2's girlfriend. She gets to be pretty,and that's all,folks. JT2 encounters cattle, elderly Tom Jones fans, and so on. It all makes for a boring odyssey.""I'll be home for Christmas"" has the power to make the hapless reviewer into an Ebenezer Scrooge."
2,It didn't wanna work right about 10 minutes in.,"I always lost like 7 minutes at about 10 minutes in, most likely due to it was cracked a little bit. Plus it skipped a few times too. So you can imagine I was very disappointed and plus it being labeled 'Very good' got under my skin a bit too. 'Acceptable' would have been best."
1,Terrible movie,"I liked this movie when I was a kid. I guess because I had a man crush on JTT.But, sweet biscuits, this movie does not hold up today. Jessica Biel looks nice though..."
2,More like a movie made for TV than a theatrical release,"This must be the worst holiday movie I've ever seen. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college student who gets left in a desert with a Santa suit ""glued"" to him because his classmates wanted to get even. But he has to get home because his dad promised to give him a Porche if he was there on Christmas eve. Of course he needs to win his girl back on the way.Everything about this movie seems like it was made for TV. There are some really funny parts but they can't save it. Why would you buy this when there are so many other holiday movies that are far better? The Santa Clause, Jingle All The Way, Home Alone, Home Alone 2 and many others make this movie look stupid. If you have to own every Christmas movie out there, then buy the VHS version since you're only going to watch it twice a year."
2,"A shallow, unconvincing waste of time and money.","This is definitely not a Christmas classic. The actors/ actresses were extremely superficial in their parts. First of all, the script was a standard Jr. High style script that offers very little real life dialogue. Secondly, the character's interaction with one another seemed rather... acted. That may sound good, but when you can tell that actors/ actresses are acting, you have a dull, unbelievable movie.Perhaps if you enjoy wasting your time and money this would be a good movie. However, if you value your thinking ability steer clear of ""I'll Be Home for Christmas."""
1,They Leak,Two out of the four valves I installed do not shut off completely. That's 50% failure. It is such a huge ordeal in time and money to replace valves you've just installed.
1,Clip board,"When I was looking at this product online, the description said it was one size, but it was actually a lot longer. This makes a difference in the job I do. Sux"
2,Mr Silver writes like he has blinders on.,"Mr Silver puts forward some interesting possibilities, however, haven't we heard them all before? I also found the book to make the broadest of generalisations and assumptions, and in doing so, I believe Mr Silver's approach is somewhat close minded. He virtually proposes 'it's only a matter of time', but what about the matter of choice? The Roman Empire though it was 'only a matter of time' too. Might is not always right. And neither is the majority, or the market. I also think Mr Silver should take the time to correctly acknowledge authorship. e.g. ""the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey written by Arthur C. Clarke."" The film was also written by Stanley Kubrick. And while he's at it, he could perhaps not misquote things. ""I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."" was not a response to a direct request for HAL to turn himself off."
4,Narragansett Bay History,"Excellent telling of the events leading to the assination of the Indian Chieftain ""King Phillip"" and the succeeding developement of the town of Bristol (RI) as a major seaport prior to the Civil War."
1,I did not like this book at all.,"I did not like this book at all. I thought it would help on the dating scene or help rekindle the lost flame, but it did neither. I advise you not to buy it, instead buy something better. It just was a bunch of sayings that people said-thats all."
2,Another message from a spirit,"First of all, this book was not written by Joan Darby; the authors wished to remain anonymous and used the pseudonyms ""Darby & Joan"". The book title refers to the entity known as ""Stephen"" who purports to be the spirit of a soldier who fell in battle in WWI. This ""Stephen"" explains the meaning and purpose of life; unfortunately nothing he says can be verified. Like all other ""revelations"", you are forced to have faith in the source."
1,Hard to squeeze if you have weak hands,"I recently purchased this stick to help me grab packages stuffed in my mailbox and hard to pull out by hand. Unfortunately, i found squeezing the handle to operate the gripper was pretty difficult. I have another gripper by a diff manufacturer which is very easy to squeeze but its too long. I bought this mainly for the short size. This stick is going back. If you have a neuro-muscular problem or arthritis..i dont recommend this stick."
2,Well made - terrible grip,This is a very well made reacher. Unfortunately it has a VERY terrible grip at the tip. Everything SLIPS. I would not buy this as a first choice. I plan to modify mine to improve the grip. OK... you've been warned! :)
3,DISAPPOINTED,I found this PikStick Pro Aluminum Reacher very hard to use. The grip is very tight especially if you have trouble with your hands.
2,Frustrating reacher/grabber,"The handle of this is nicely made, and the trigger works great. But the jaws are angled oddly, and make using this item very frustrating. The rubber jaws meet only at the tips, and things just slide out. Small items, big items, it doesn't seem to matter. I tried about five times to pick up a remote from the floor, and never could manage it. Wish they had thought this through more carefully, because the length is great. I won't order a PikStik again, and I had high hopes for it from the writeup."
3,good length - poor clamping,The short length is a good alternative to the longer one we had but disappointed in the clamping. Items slip through the clamp too easily.
5,PicStick,"Works great for wheelchair. Just the right length (20"") from chair to floor pickups. Heavy duty,well built. Love the way the pickup clamp head rotates vertical or horizontal."
1,Do Not Pik PikStik,Horrible product. Quit working within one week. Handicapped wife used it and could not abuse it if she had to. The jaws will not close. You are better off with Salad Tongs!! I emailed the PikStik service department on their website and they kicked back their own page back to me. Stay away from PikStik!!
1,worthless,"Won't close up tight enough to grasp anything. Good thing I also ordered a folding one, but it also has it's fallbacks, after a lot of use, the cable breaks. Can't win for losing."
1,Not what it claims to be,"I was very disappointed in this item. I have arthritis in both hands and this was supposed to be easy gripping. I have not found it so. The tips are not as flexible as other grabbers I have. It is very hard to grip some things. I didn't return it because it came in a huge box and I couldn't deal with it. Also, too short, but that is my fault-I did not measure it."
1,Contains LATEX,"The description didn't match what was sent. Needs to state if the product contains Latex. Product contains LATEX and caused immediate problems for the end user. It would be fantastic to have a product that is 20"" and one 12"" if it didn't contain latex."
3,Great But a little short,"I bought this for my wife who is only 5'2"", but even for her its a little short. Other than that the grip is easy to use, and appears to be pretty heavy-duty. Next time I'll go for the longer model."
5,Fun strenght training,"I love Leslie Sansone, and am a long time fan. I do enjoy some workouts more than others, and on another site I belong to I saw some negative reviews on this one, but decided to give it a shot. I completely disagree! If you are a Sansone fan (if not still go for it!) But it has two of the old tried and trues, Mary Kay and Carol working along with Leslie. It is a strenght training workout that you will need weights for, and is not hard, but gives you a great feeling that you have built up some strenght and worked some muscles. I love the background which is someone's beautiful house, and the music is upbeat and uplifting. I loved this one!!"
3,"Not a ""walk"" at all","I am familiar with Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs. I already own the 1, 2 and 3 mile series so I was looking for something different. Well, I am disapointed in this DVD. It's not walking at all, unless you count the 5 minutes you spend walking in the warm up. After that, it's just standing around doing different exercises with weights. If you want to walk as a form of exercise, don't buy this DVD!"
5,Work out video,"I LOVE Leslie Sansone's workout video's! Sometimes, though, I wish she would stop talking so I can hear the Christian music. I got the product fast and the price was comparable to what I would have paid at the store - but Amazon has a better selection of her videos."
5,Excellent Workout..... Two Thumbs Up ! Leslie's the Best,"I love it !Leslie and her two instructor's lead you through 4 diffrent strength training excercises, walking to warm up, upper body with dumbbells, lower body with ankle weights and abs on the floor.And finally full body stretching.If you like any of Leslie's videos from 1998 to present.. you will love this one.There's not a lot of chatty people,and the music is beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful and complete workout in 35 mins."
3,PNY P-PNY233-3D-PB Processor Upgrade for Pentium,"I read the short description of the product, then there is no Specifications what so ever mention or found to this item.I would like to say for any upgrade around a $100.00 to achieve 300 to 400 MHz and of course enough Ram is sufficiant to run windows without crashing or locking up, and yes, minimum to keep up the moderate gaming apps. What I need is the required voltage settings (Core Volts) and frequency range and multiplier set. Also, the Front Bus speed... Well, that's the bottom line, Oh, one more thing the 'pin' count. Thanks 'trd55'."
3,"Es mejor ""Nunca te diré adiós""","Guardian es uno de los pocos grupos de rock cristiano estadounidense que entrega su ministerio en español para los más de 500 millones de hispanos en el mundo y lleva sus giras en Centro y Sudamérica. En Chile dieron un concierto gratuito a una cárcel y mostraron en una presentación al público días antes del concierto que en realidad su música la hacen por amor a Cristo y no por el ""show-business"". Estoy muy contento que sigan entregando música cristiana en su estilo... pero encontré mejor ""Nunca te diré adiós"", su primer álbum en español. Ojalá Amazon pueda vender este CD, ya que mi casette está maltrecha de tanto escucharla... (can you hear me, Amazon's boys?. Sell ""Nunca te diré adiós"" tape and CD!)"
2,A Spanish Rerecording of Guardian Songs,"This is a recording primarily of interest for those that want to have everything Guardian has recorded.It contains songs from Miracle Mile, Swing, Swang, Swung, Buzz, and Bottle Rocket, all recorded in Spanish.As such, there is no new material not available (in English) on their other albums.Pretty much what you'd expect from a translation of an album to a different language..."
1,STINKY STUFF!,"Sorry, but I have bought several Lemongrass Mint products from different manufacturers and this smells NOTHING like them. It smells more like a hospital cleaner than anything else. I have a GOOD nose, and I am sorry, but this smell is NOT PLEASANT to me in any way."
4,Wonderful introduction to clematis,"I have very much enjoyed this book. Clearly, the author grows clematis and is an avid fan of them. She doesn't talk down to the reader, but offers plenty of advice in a breezy, conversational manner. This is no plain catalog-like listing of as many cultivars as possible with barebones information. This is a book to read. This book can get a new clematis grower grounded."
1,big disappointmnet,"I had great hopes for this book; hope that it would be the first REAL book about clematis for the North American grower. Don't bother. The author's style is too casual and cavalier. There isn't even one really new cultivar. She should have stayed with photography. By the way, I have a HUGE clematis garden. Trust me. I own every book ever written about clematis!!"
1,Very worthless book.,"The book,talked a lot about Clematis,but it was just talk.There was nothing,in the book,to grow better and healther Clematis.In my opimion,the book,is worthless."
3,All the stories even out average.,"There were only two stories that I really thought were funny. Most were pretty good, about 12, but the rest were AWFUL! For collectors, but most might want to borrow it. Especially the story by Jean Rabe. First she mangles Dragonlance, Krynn. Now, she must ruin Faerun."
4,Get to know someone kinky,"This is a collection of 54 columns written by Sensuous Sadie. The vast majority of these are very personal, dealing with her kink, her experiences, and her feelings. Only a few are really about topics of general information and even these are based on her experiences. Overall if you know who Sadie is and have enjoyed her online columns this book is a good way to catch up. If you aren't familiar with her, you'll get to be as you read. I really wish the entire book were organized chronologically instead of by subject because I think that would make our journey into her mind more powerful."
2,Disappointing,A series of reprinted columns that make occasional titilating reading but more often cursory discussion of topics and disjointed reading. The title was the best part of this book.
5,great,the all product is acctualy 13 episodes and you need to sell the all 13 of it as an option.pleas check and tell me how to buy 5-6 and 1-2.all the rest i have.thanks
3,I was expecting better :(,"I purchased this product a few months back, expecting to receive some very cool PowerPoint and Word templates, but was very much disappointed. PowerPoint temps are more for use in creating digital photoalbums, the ones that are dedicated presentation slides are very lame and drab I would certainly stick to the ones in Office. The ones in Word were very disappointing, its like they were trying to turn Word into a desktop publishing programme, its very difficult to navigate in application that was not made for creating postcards. The Outlook stationaries are satisfactory but I do not always use them, Excel is also satisfactory it has templates for creating book list and ""student register"". Overall I would suggest purchasing a third party app with much more pleasing templates than this. I was also expecting templates for MS Access."
3,Good for home users and students,"These templates are good for home users and students but if you're a business looking for more professional looking templates, you can skip this item. This is not a product for the office environment."
2,obtiene lo que paga,realmente el precio dice lo que se obtiene. Personal portfolio es muy grande el titulo para lo que el programa ofrece. En cualquier sitio gratis de la web puede abtener algo mejor. Jorge G. El Salvador
1,Awful book,"This book was awful. The sociological concepts were so trite and unimportant, not to mention the obvious bias from the age of the sociologist in a college setting..."
5,Another Great Perspective,"A REAL story about college life. Insightful, honest, and true. I found it comforting (and a little disturbing) to hear about college through the eyes and ears of an observer living it day to day. This book tells it like it is, something very few books on college life achieve. Another title I can't recommend enough is The Naked Roommate: And 107 Other Issues You Might Run Into in College. Another non-fiction account of college life, right from the mouths of students from over 100 college campuses (author is Harlan Cohen). I read it and then gave it to my daughter. Both are 5 stars."
5,Students Delighted!,"I can't believe how many people have criticized this book. This teacher wanted people to see what a Freshman goes through. I am a student at Northern Arizona University unlike most of you and don't like people who don't even ATTEND NAU trying to speak for us students. You should judge the book for its content, not how the information was gathered. I speak for a lot of students when I say a job well done."
2,Undecided,"I just finished reading this book for my English class and I have to say I'm completely unsure whether I like this book or not. The author was a bit unethical in not telling the people around her about her real reasons for being there and I thought it was kind of sketchy that a lady her age was living in a dorm full of 18 year olds. I think her data might be biased because even if she did become a student, most actual students wouldn't divulge their inner most thoughts with someone that's not exactly like them. I wouldn't for sure anyhow for fear of getting in trouble or something like that. She seems like a nice enough lady with good intentions however, I'm just not sure she went about this study in the correct way."
1,...,A cutesy Hallmark book ... not good anthropological work. Read this in anthropology class as an example of what not to write in an ethnography.
1,Research based on betrayal has no place in anthropology,"My daughter is a sophmore in college, and she loaned me her copy of My Freshman Year. As an anthropologist I was disapointed to see ""Rebekah Nathan"" use dishonesty at so many junctures where a straight forward approach would have produced similar or better results. Nathan seemed to believed that these freshmen were so exotic that they would not be honest with her, so then she chose to become the liar and misrepresented herself to them. I hope she leaves anthropology for sociology, where such practices are more accepted, anthropologists have no use for such trickery. It is remarkable how many of these non-anthropologist reviewers here don't understand the damage ""Rebekah Nathan"" has done."
3,"Not a Review, or What Cathleen Donovan Should Have Titled Her ""Review""","As the title indicates this is not a review, but a rebuke of Cathleen Donovan's attack on the Author's ""Methodolgy.""The fact that this ""review"" made it past Amazon's IRB signals that they must be more concerned about having high numbers of reviews for each title than they are about the substance and appropriateness of the reviews in questions. If amazon dares to show its face at a National Conference of Online book sellers who profess to provide Reviews of the items they sell then they will surely be met with hostility.I am curious how the ""obvious ethical shortcomings"" blinded NAU. Cathleen writes, ""NAU seems to have become blinded by the obvious ethical shortcomings."" Anyway enough already with this other ""non-review"" of a book that I learned about in The Chronicle of Higher Education not The New York Sun.If you found this useful then good."
2,Inaccuracies make book amusing,"When someone in their fifties decides to go back to college as a student, their view is in no way going to be what the average student sees from college life. The author failed as an anthropologist to report concise and accurate data, as she did few consistant studies and never reported as an unbiased individual. Since she was a professor, she looked at college from a professor's eyes, not that of a students. Therefore, this work is not in any means insightful as to the real college experience."
4,Honest and Heartfelt,"I waited with anticipation for my copy of ""My Freshman Year"" to be delivered from Amazon. I'd read a few reviews and was really curious what was new for college freshmen. After reading the book, I was amazed at how Ms. Nathan (aka Dr. Small) was able to see college life as it really is through the eyes of a freshman. From the frustrations of dealing with college administration, financial aid, and negotiating the campus (wihtout the benefit of faculty parking) to really understanding the stresses of today's students, Nathan/Small did all students a service by showing the difficulties they face. As a resident of northern Arizona, I've also been able to talk to local students and have found their impressions to be much like mine. Positive and appreciative that one of their professors actually took the time to walk in their shoes."
2,not what i expected,"It takes a lot for me to stop reading a book I purchase. This book was not what it seemed. Most of the book read like an academic paper. I was hoping for more of a social take. After trying a few times to get into it, it didn't keep my interest."
4,"Good Pushpins - Reusable Box, Not So Much","They're just pushpins. Sturdy, functional pushpins. Very decent value for the price. My only complaint is the ""reusable box"" if they want to call it a reusable box, then I don't think it would be to much to ask for the box to latch. It looks like it was designed to latch shut but it doesn't. So if you accidentally knock over the box, be prepared to play 100 pushpin pick up. I just put a rubber band around the box and problem solved. Otherwise this product would have gotten a 5 star review."
4,Excellent mapping product but... with one exception.,"I have used MapPoint for about three years now and I just upgraded. Overall, it is an excellent, full-featured product that is very intuitive and easy to use.I use MapPoint along with a full-blown professional ArcView-based GIS system. I find that MapPoint allows me to perform ""quick and dirty"" and relatively simple GIS tasks without having to get into the more complicated and time consuming - albeit more capable - ArcView GIS system.Truth is, I could probably rely completely on MapPoint except for one shortfall in the program. You can only create customized boundaries based on the pre-existing included boundaries (Census Tracts, Zip Code areas, etc.).For example, rather than being able to go in and create a boundary around a neighborhood, I have to conform this ""custom"" boundary to something like Zip code boundaries or census tracts, etc. that are inluded in MapPoint.Microsoft, include this feature in MapPoint 2003 and you will get 10-stars!"
2,Obsolete when it hits your door,"While the mapping and search capability is awesome, the package is hopelessly obsolete when you get it.Freeways that went in near me three years ago are not reflected. If the files could be updated, I say it's a worthwhile product. In this case, though, it is not."
3,MapPoint 2002 Documentation Poor,"The program is a good idea and has potential but the documentation is very poor. Don't expect to get help from the Microsoft web page. When you call Microsoft for assistance they tell you that because you didn't buy the program as part of the office suite, they don't support it.I still manage to get great maps but I always feel like I'm only using about 25% of the programs potential but then again, how would I know? The program also has Microsoft's goofy new validation scheme on it. You can find better software at lower prices that are easier to use."
2,I suppose it's okay.....,"If it's what you need, it may work well. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money for my company and our needs. We need to be able to define worldwide territories as well as a few within the US, and it wouldn't do both. Importing from an Excel file would not work for both the US and other international regions. Further, it took up nearly a full gigabyte of hard drive."
2,missing and / or bad data,As with Microsoft's other trip planning software the data supporting places is both missing in many cases or just bad data. I had hoped that in their high end product that they would have improved the data supporting their product. They should leave the mapping software to Rand McNally and similar professionals.As a business professional I can't afford to use Microsoft's product and arrive at the wrong site.
3,MapPoint 2002 in VB.NET development environment,".""Drag and drop"" windows form control is great for VB6, but (deliberately ?) does not work as a web form control in VB.NETMicrosoft seems to want to encourage use of the MapPoint.NET web service, their first available (pay-per-use) public web service.However, that web service does not (yet ?) provide data overlay capabilities which many businesses require.[ P.S. ... as a developer, how am I supposed to test this in a secure test environment which doesn't permit internet connectivity ? ]Summary/Conclusion: MapPoint 2002 is a great product, but if you want to use it with Microsoft's latest and best .NET framework, it still has some serious gaps.."
3,Leave some things in the dust,"I was testing the program, and it was interesting, but still it's not up to date. I looked for a town of 1,000 residents in California, and it wasnt there. I then looked for a town of less than 20, and it was there. Very weird."
5,Awesome Mapping Software!!!,"I have used this software for the last 2 years for a major ""Walk"" in our school system. The features for entering addresses into Excel and importing them to MapPoint makes it wonderful. It's faster and offers many more functions than the online maps. Also, it has the capability to download updates on highway construction and street changes."
5,Microsoft helps you find your way!,"I am very impressed with Microsoft's newest MapPoint edition. We have been able to illustrate office locations, insert maps onto our website, and send directions/maps as attachments via e-mail.A terrific product for the consumer market."
3,Angel S'mores,"I ordered the set of 3 s'mores angel ornaments and received 2 of the same, instead of 3 different angels. When I requested to exchange, I was told I would need to send the entire set back for a full refund since there were no more of that set in stock. I chose to keep the ornaments and have 2 of the same instead of hasseling with sending them back and waiting for a refund. Maybe one day I will come across the angel holding the horn!"
5,Twinkie is awesome and anointed.,"I must say I have always loved the Clark Sisters. They have a certain quality in their voices that moves me. I loved the selection of songs on this CD. Some songs are new and some have been recorded before. However there aren't that many older songs on this CD. But I never get tired them. She always add something different to those songs that makes it sounds more moving than the previous recording. Actually Twinkie can sing ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and it would still move me to tears. I love this CD and I would definitely recommend it to everyone."
2,Very disappointed,I must say that I am a big fan of Ms. Twinkie.. but i am very disappointed... The songs are wonderful but if you have some of her early releases it is the same songs... I think Twinkie needs to come out with something new.. But it is a good buy if you don't own any of her other cds. if you own her previous cds don't waste your money..
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the CD. It was nothing like the one I had heard on the radio. Unfortunately, I did not know the title of the one I heard, so I picked one at randon, which did not compare at all."
3,Classics - 'For those rainy Sunday afternoons'.,"Not bad, but only for those die hard old-time Greek tales. The color and sound reasonable but I noticed the sound quality not to Warner DVD's usual standard and really had to push up the volume. Not sure if this was my copy or the entire DVD reproduction range.Still, an interesting story and if you like these old tales, then certainly a welcome edition to the library. If you have been to Greece and the island of Rhodes then this is a chance to see how it was in those days - and I say this tongue in cheek!"
2,"great story, cinematography, direction but rory calhoun is miscast in this movie.",the movie was superbly done by sergio leone well known for the spaghetti western of clint eastwood. great cinematography and action but rory calhoun is very badly miscast in this epic movie. steve reeves should have been chosen for his role here. rory calhoun looks like a cowboy wearing sword aand sandals. terrible!
3,I was looking for more documentary and less prima donna..,"I purchased this because I have always been a weather junkie and wanted to learn more; the chase episodes were very disappointing. If I were forced to ride in the vehicle for a day with the overwhelmingly negative photographer, I would find another chase vehicle to occupy! The second dvd is much more interesting, with various types of weather related disasters, what causes them, how they will affect us worst case scenario, etc. I also bought this for my sister, and she raved about the second dvd. Unless they find a new photographer, I won't be buying any additional seasons of the show. The woe-is-me doom and gloom attitude of the photographer guarantees that this won't make many repeat performances in my disc changer."
3,Just an OK DVD,I got this for my son (age 9) who loves this sort of thing on TV. I guess this wasn't as exciting as what he is used to.
4,"Product Activation scares, misinformation","The new XP Product Activation that is in Windows XP, Office XP, and this Visio do not require you to phone Microsoft when you ""upgrade your hard drive"" as is indicated below. It would take a monstrous upgrade of many components to require another phone call - please consider that ""ugly"" listed below is not nearly as ugly as described."
2,More flawed software from Microsoft,Upon using this software it has froze my Windows98 OS multiple times. Walls do not auto-align and in one month's worth of use it has caused 6 fatal errors.Granted it's easy to use but for the price lacks the power of other layout software. I only use it because it is a common tool and file layout within my industry.
4,A fun tale for cowboys and cowgirls alike,"Poor Ernestine! She comes all the way from County Clare, Ireland to be a mail-order bride in Lizard Lick, Texas, only to find that her bridegroom--who bears the wonderful name of Virgil Beetle--is a tobacco-chewing cad who lives with his awful family and who doesn't give a hoot what she thinks or feels.After biding her time with the Beetles until a preacher can be found, Ernestine boldly decides to make a quick getaway disguised as a cowboy. She meets up with the cowboy Texas Teeth and they have some adventures together herding cattle before eventually falling in love.Although the illustrations are colorful, they verge on amateurishness. But the story is well told, and author/illustrator Nicole Rubel has obvious affection for her subject, and that makes all the difference. Lots of fun for any little kid who's ever pretended to be a cattle-herdin' cowgirl or cowboy."
3,Sweet Duets,"If you're already a fan of either Harry ""Sweets"" Edison of Earl ""Fatha"" Hines this is yet another chapter in their long careers that's worth a listen. Recorded in 1978, this collection of 7 duets is a fine performance by both artists in the sunset of their playing days. Edison was 63 at this time and Hines must have been in the same neighborhood. As such, it's not the best performance technically, but don't get me wrong - they both still have their chops. Hines stride piano style is a nice undercurrent for Edison's bluesy improvisation and both remain inventive. The selection of tunes is appropriately standards and classic ballads. Recommended but not the best example of either man's contribution to jazz."
2,not good enough,This stuff does not have the proper levels of salt for your hermit crab. You are better off buying Instant Ocean and mixing 1/2 a cup per gallon of water.
5,perfect for my hermies,This is a great product.. makes it super easy to provide a salt water dish for my hermit crabs. Even provides a little measuring cup to make this completely foolproof.
2,Good Music - No Lyrics Included,If you know the Lyrics then this CD makes a good sound track to sing with at a friends wedding. If you do not know the Lyrics you may want to try a different source as lyrics are not included with this selection.
1,"15 Country Wedding Favorites, Compact Disc [CD]","Not sure what the other reviewer received in place of this CD, but there are most definitely lyrics. I would play this at any wedding unless I had live performers. Especially track 9: ""The Man In Love With You"" and the duet on track 14: ""You And I"""
5,great headboard for the money,I shopped a dozen furniture stores looking for a cottage style headboard in white and couldn't find anything under 500 dollars. This headboard was exactly what I was looking for. It's solid and substantial. The assebly took about fourty five minutes to an hour and I'm extremely pleased with it. I would highly recommend this item
2,NOT white!,"My daughter picked this out for her room, the picture makes it look like a distressed white, which would have matched the rest of her furniture. No, its nothing like white, antique or not. Its the color of sand. And the distressing is so fake looking. Also, you would think a headboard wouldn't take 10 pages of instructions to put together. The style is very cute. Once I paint it I'm sure it will be fine. What a pain though."
3,"Not ""antique white"", more of a beige color","Not too thrilled with how this is described as antique white color, the photo they display makes it took a more white color than it actually is. My husband & son put it together while I was out, it would be a hassle to try and return it now. it is actually more of a beige color, (I needed it to be white to match the rest of the room), not sure if I can paint it.... it was also missing the brackets that attach it to the bed frame."
3,Pre-drilled holes did not match up...,"I have been putting together this type of furniture for years. The pre-drilled holes on this product do not match up to the parts. Some of parts are were not cut to the proper length. I had to make my own holes and also reinforce the top portion because the hardware provided is not adequate to feel safely sleeping under it. Over all the product is heavy, but plan on reinforcing it yourself. Looks nice but I don't think it would survive a move or anything like that....strictly disposable furniture."
4,Very Sturdy Nice Looking Headboard,"Overall, a very nice product. Incredibly sturdy and heavy (package was about 95 pounds). Took a while to assemble and the curved part between the two knob posts on top of the headboard had the pre-drilled holes drilled too long so we had to order a new part but it shipped very fast. I recommend having one person to help hold parts as you have to do a lot of lining up of pre-drilled holes. I was looking for something with a cottagey feel and this fit the bill."
4,Dumb Girls Don't Go to Heaven,"Las tontas no van al Cielo (920 minutes) is a telenovela (English captions) I liked so much I bought a copy from Amazon.com. Billed as a comedy, it still has the requisite melodrama, wildly passionate characters, evil plotters and misguided relatives, murder attempts and custody battles we expect from a telenovela.Of course we see babies born out of wedlock, a runaway bride, a plastic surgeon, a teenager with HIV, a construction company that launders money for the Mafia, lots of DNA tests, seductions and philandering.One of my favorite characters is one who becomes the rock the rest of the family orbits around: a gay man who had been banished from the ""familia"" for being gay. This ended up being unpredictable and the alternate ending they tacked on in the Extras is hilarious! I REALLY like Valentine Lanús!"
5,Antibacterial wash that is not medicinal in the least,"I recently needed to find antibacterial cleansing products due to health reasons. This one is by far my favorite of the ones I've ordered and tried. It smells nice, not too flowery, and its nice and sudsy on a washcloth."
1,Original versions for sure?,"A few reviewers here state that the CD's in this 3-pakcompiliation are the orginal un-adulterated versions.My only question is why the three album covers depictedon the main cover are the same graphics as the singleadulterated versions? Don't want to be too ""Paranoid""here but just want to be sure before breaking open thepiggie bank."
3,Good CD set for true Ozzy fans.,"This is everything Ozzy fans want. They should have made it four CD's so we could have Crazy Train also. Without Crazy Train it is like having KISS without Rock n Roll all Night... You can get the CD cheaper at the AOL ""Shopping"" Channel so shop around."
3,Overrated,"This book is cute and interactive, and I can imagine it was much more ""thrilling"" in 1989 when it was first published. But I think this book (with consistent 5/5 star ratings) is very overrated. I own dozens of children's books that are cuter and more fun, and dozens of popups and interactive books that leave this in the dust."
4,Pop Up Mice is Nice!,"We had this book and my daughter destroyed it! Now that she is a bit older she was Thrilled when I surprised her with a new ""working"" version of the book. You just can't go wrong with an interactive version of a Dr. Suess book (Lesig spelled backward is Gisel - Dr. Suess' real last name!) I would suspect most kids would love this book - thumbs up!"
5,Good memories,My dad got me this book when I was little and I read it so much it doesn't really have any of the pop up things anymore. I'm 24 now and wanting books for the kids I will have and I found this and was so excited! It was one of my favorite books when I was little. It is full of fun and entertainment. Dr. Suess is one of my favorite children's book authors. I love this book.
3,They could have done better,This is a compilation of Irish music - suggesting the profound influence on American music- they could have made better selections
5,Cano: a musical Dali,"Nacho Cano en este álbum muestra en toda su furia la excentrica esencia de su calidad como compositor. Combina lo divino en una pesadilla sublime que a la vez que te hacen soñar con paraísos te envuelven en la tela de un liviano sueño a veces melancólico, a veces enfermizo en ocasiones sensual."
4,National Lampoon's Van Wilder,Extremely funny movie. A few shock laughs. Smokin hot babes. Bulldogs. One of my favorites. What more could you ask for?
3,Good sound machine,The sound machine helps me because I have Tinitis and I need a sound diversion. It is good for what I need. If I do not have the diversion of other sounds then my Tinitis is very annoying. It is a good product and I love that it is battery operated so I can take it when I travel.
4,Relax with Obus Forme Sound Therapy,"I bought this for myself after I bought this as a gift for someone else. I liked the features of the off/on button that remembers the last sound you set it on. All I have to do it hit the on button before I go to bed. My last sleep sound machine was the Life Wise. The on/off switch was difficult and was also the volumn control. Then I had to fumble for my sound button each night. I like the white noise to go to sleep with. It drowns out any barking dogs, car noise or snoring. When the grand-daughters come over to stay, I use it to help them fall asleep. Now all I have to do is remember to take it with me when I travel so I can get a restful night's sleep. I recommend this to anyone that has problems going to sleep because of outside noises."
2,So-So,I can't say we have used this a whole lot. I thought it would be good for my children to sleep by since I like a little noise when I sleep. But it keeps them awake for the most part. I guess it probably would be helpful for some other people. But just not us.
5,Obus Forme Sound Therapy Relaxation System,"This is a very well designed machine with a good number of selectable sounds and volume,also can be set to shut off after one hour,and can run on batts."
3,could be better,"I suppose this is normal for a machine of this type. But the sounds, while realistic initially, tend to grate on my nerves after awhile. Of course the sound is just repeated over and over with no variance. With a CD of nature sounds there is more variety to the sounds and that slight variety apparently is what lulls me to sleep. I can't say I recommend this machine. If you prefer the sound of a stream, try Relax With Mountain Streams it's great."
4,Sleep Made Easier!,"I'm enjoying using my sound therapy relaxation system. I primarily have used it to block out my husband's snoring and my dog's snoring. My kids love it, though! They like having it on while they are trying to sleep too! Nice volume control - all of the controls are easy to use during the night when the lights are off!"
1,wasnt worth it,"for the price, this product can be skipped. I was surprised at how the phones in the house were effected by this, and the sounds were not soothing. The service was good, just the product lacked..."
3,"Pretty good, but...","Unit is decent, but not great. Batteries seem to last a long time, Most of the sounds are good, the poor ones are really crappy. It could really use a better speaker, but it does what it's supposed to do."
5,Purchased as a gift,I purchased this for my mother as a gift. She uses it almost every night and says she loves it.
1,Save your $8 and order the Conair,"I ordered this sound machine, along with the Conair one to try out different ones for my babies rooms. Obviously, I'm a bit sleep deprived and didn't notice that they look exactly alike in the photos. Well, I got them both and they are EXACTLY the same, only this one is white and the Conair is silver. Same size, same noises, same everything, only this one is $8 MORE expensive. Silly. It works great, but get the Conair, it works great for less money."
3,Works Great - although....,"Pros -runs on batteries or AC...gets good mileage from batteries-easy to operate/turn on when you are half asleep-gets pretty loud, and the sound quality is quite good-can set for 1 hour duration, or constantly onCons -most of the sounds are simply not useful. I had hopes for the oceanwaves, but they are too close together (have they never heard ofentrainment?). Birds chirping? Sounds like a wakeup call! The onlysound I have found useful is the 'running stream', but hey, it worksreally well for this insomniac. I'm glad I found this thing, but wishthey had put more thought into the sounds."
2,Sound Therapy System,Sound is very fake sounding - it kept me awake and I ended up getting rid of it. Spend the money on something higher quality.
1,Not what expected,"The sound therapy system was not relaxing but annoying. The digital sound, each time the selected noise repeated, interferred with the quality expected."
2,Sound terapy machine not so good therapy,"This sound machine was a disappoint. I do not know if it was faulty, or just worked this way. The sound itself was too loud and you could not reduce it. We wanted it to run all night, but it unpredictably went to static off and on. We had no problem returning the item and obtaining a refund."
5,What would YOU do to get your hands on some acid......?,"Oh my God, how do you begin to review a film this bad? A film so terrible that it is easily beaten in the entertainment stakes by the appalling short that precedes it (an exhortation to get involved with industrial arts!?!). A film so misguided that it thinks that a good way to introduce one of the main characters is to have him fight with an identically-dressed and similarly-featured co-character - at night....with the camera about 30 yards away...and out of focus. Actually that's one of the better bits.Crow, Servo and Mike show their usual genius for mecilessly ripping a movie to pieces (although it doesn't really need much help in this) and also demonstrate a surprising skill at swing choir singing. Superb as always."
2,Mediocre and rushed adaptation...,"I was very disappointed when this product came out.Potentially it could have been the highlight of the early d20 system's open license, but the producers did a very 2nd rate job of putting together the materials.The presentation was no better then a novice could've accomplished on a home pc. The artwork was old, the organisation was not updated at all for the new book and directly borrowed from prior products.This setting is just waiting for someone who really cares to adapt it in a good light instead of rushing to make a quick buck.I expected more from such a fine company as Chaosium."
2,Missing Information,"Although the book chronicles the lives of one of the great car building and racing teams, it leaves out an integral part of the story. The author states, "" I've purposely decided to steer clear of the politics and disagreements that occurred between John (Holman) and Ralph (Moody)."" The author talks about all of the people who asked him to ""concentrate on the positive.""Can you imagine if every book was written this way? Although one learns alot about their relationship with Ford and the drivers, what's missing is the details of what made Holman & Moody such an intersting and dynamic combination.For $40, one would expect the whole story."
2,Holman & Moody deserve better.,"Overall the book has nice design, photos, and production but is sorely lacking in proof reading and editing. There are numerous and repeated examples of incorrect spellings. Some examples: Ford Galaxie is incorrectly spelled in book as ""Galaxy"" and driver Rodger Ward's name spelled ""Roger."" The authors were either sloppy or the proof reading nonexistent. It makes you wonder about the accuracy of other data."
3,Not all that simple for US undergrads,"Really, I could give this book four stars on some points, like its introducing Lagrangian mechanics at an introductory level. And it isn't a bad book at all -- just that it is NOT for first year undergrads at US universities as it is for Europeans who tend to be ahead of us at this level. It uses vector calculus almost from the start, for example, and its problem sets are difficult compared to most problems in Serway and other standard first-year physics texts. However, as a supplement (if you want to spend $37 for a small book), it will likely give you more of an edge in the long run if you can figure it out."
2,faded...,i had to give these to my sister and even she didn't care for them. they have a wide v-neck with a thick band and it just doesn't look right and they feel uncomfortable. and they fade a lot...
4,Manilla Road - 'Out Of The Abyss' (Leviathan Records),"Good all-American later '80's heavy rock effort by this little known trio that hails from Wichita,Kansas.I saw them in some dive on this very tour.Heard they had a decent sized following in and around certain parts of Europe,not sure of just how accurate that info is. Either way,this is a decent lp to listen to. Favorable cuts include ""Rites of Blood"", ""Return Of The Old Ones"", the heavy hitting ""Black Cauldron"" and ""War In Heaven"". Line-up: Mark Shelton-guitar&vocals,Scott Park-bass and Randy Fox-drums. Just might appeal to some fans of Uriah Heep, Foghat, early Ted Nugent and April Wine."
1,Visio 4 was great... don't bother upgrading,"I recently had to upgrade from Visio 4 to MS Visio 2000 because a customer used it and (of course) there were file incompatibilities! (Nothing like forcing customers to upgrade via incompatibilities rather than true features, huh Microsoft?)Sorry, I'm really a closet fan of Microsoft software in general, but if I hadn't paid the rediculous $350 myself, I might have never noticed the difference from Visio 4. The Visio 2000 upgrade just didn't change much, and the one new tool I tried to use (auto web page mapping) didn't work well.So in reading the new features and improvements in Visio 2002, I'm completely underwhelmed again. The basic Visio functionality is amazing, but it always was. If you have an older version of Visio, stick with it. I just don't see the need to upgrade."
2,Look at OpenOffice.org draw features before buying,"I've been fiddling with the OpenOffice.org and StarOffice features for a while, then took a look at the Draw program. I was blown away. It's like a mini Visio Elements -- it's got the connector lines you need and really good control over positioning, plus it's got a gallery where you can store prefab shapes.Seriously, download OpenOffice.org if you're not a huge Visio power user. You'll be really surprised and impressed, and of course OpenOffice.org is free, so that helps."
2,Totally agree: OpenOffice.org preferable for non power users,"I totally agree with the other reviewer; I use OpenOffice.org for most of my diagramming needs and it works really well. Visio is fine most of the time but I prefer to have more interchangeable formats and OpenOffice.org outputs to EPS etc. and I've just found it to be really great for my technical diagram needs.So yes. Power users, maybe spend the money on Visio; ""regular"" people, download OpenOffice.org and try those connector lines and the gallery where you can put all the existing shapes you need."
1,Worst Graphics Program Ever,"Once again Microsoft is putting out {garbage}. I use Adobe Illustrator and Visio is not even in the ballpark as far as ease of use or capability. Even for the most simple functions Visio is cumbersome, clumsy and difficult to use. One example is text that is not scaleable. Why would anybody in their right mind want a graphics program where the test does not scale with the graphic? Selecting objects and using layers are both absolutely horrible. The interface is also very not intuitive! Microsoft, please put this foolish excuse for a graphics program out of it's (and our) misery!"
2,Interesting but needs more counterarguments,"Darknet uses the stories about individuals and their relationship to media to discuss complex issues such as copyright and fair use. It is a very easy read. It does not get into legal or technical issues directly. It uses these personal stories to illustrate the impact of those issues on a few interesting, unusual people. Reading the book is like being around strangers who all believe the same thing and are reinforcing each others' beliefs. Yes there are truths here, but you know that you are only getting one side of the story. It would be nice to find a book that presents the counter arguments. Amazon would do the world a service by identifying that book and selling it with Darknet as a boxed set. Until then, if you are interested in understanding all sides of the debate over copyright and fair use, I do not recommend Darknet for a stand-alone read."
1,Regretfully unbalanced writing,"J. D. Lasica certainly has a large number of friends and family. There is no other explanation for the plethora of 5 star ratings for this biased diatribe. Based on many of the reviews, I was hoping for a thoughtful presentation of both sides of the arguments around some very important issues; fair use, artistic freedom, and consumer rights. Instead he presents the extreme end of one side's position and either mocks or omits completely any rational presentation of the other. Very disappointing. If you want to read it, check it out at the library - in keeping with his philosophy. Your money is better spent elsewhere."
1,"Good ideas, presented in an extremely biased manner","Having just read the book and reread these reviews, I am struck by the unarguable fact that the lower-starred reviews actually review the book, while the four and five star entries are advocates expressing their support for the author's position. This is a very frustrating book to read, not because what the author says is wrong, but because it is so unbalanced. The author fixates on the good that may come from 'freeing' content, but completely fails to discuss the 'chilling effect' such actions can have on artists who don't want their work to be freed. The author mocks and demonizes 'big media' without acknowledge that it supports the innovation and creativity of artists and artisans who chose to be a part of it."
5,Fun and fast,"This is a really classic game unlike many made these days. It's fun and super easy to learn, and while I've only played with adults I could see it being a great game for kids. It's colorful, tactile, and has a nice short game-play (one round for kids and tourneys for us!)"
3,not so pleased,When I got the watch I instantly want to send it back...it`s big and bulky for a Skagen and the band color it`s brick-orange not red at all.
3,Pioneer Jews,"Although the plot is somewhat hokey, it is refreshing to see a novel centering around a strong Jewish woman in the 1800's. Although the basis for the story (Jewish girl needs to chose between her parent's culture or making a new life for herself with the man she loves) is intriguing, the writing falls flat. The characters aren't quite one dimensional, but do seem a bit cardboard. All in all, a fine read for an afternoon by the pool, but nothing for posterity."
4,Productive approach to the problematic Islamic Law,"As a short monograph amounting to a mere 150 pages, it is hardly worth the exhorbitant price exceeding $80. Still, Gerber once again demonstrates productive approach to the question of 'kadi law' in the Ottoman context and the issue of its compatibility with modernity and secularism. Though some of his efforts to give a positive answer to this question are deeply problematic, his treatment of the literature and new examinations of the social practice of law in the empire is insightful and an invalueable resource for all interested in the topic."
4,Well worth the money,This phone has been dependable and well worth the price. My only complaint is that it seems to be impossible to turn off the ringer.
3,Great while it lasted,"This phone offered clear sound and decent range while it lasted, but it wasn't very durable. It quit working and I had to replace it less than a year after the original purchase. If price, sound quality and range are more important to you than durability, it might be a good value for you. If you want something that will stand up to a lot of use and that you won't have to replace anytime soon, keep looking."
3,Good for the price-loud ring,"I am happy with the phone, except, purchased it for my bedroom,the ring is terribly loud and unpleasant. I've always hadAT&T(Lucent) phones in the past and the ring was better.I havealso recently purchased a Uniden phone and the ring is similar, maybe this is just how the newer phones ringers are. I don't enjoy hearing my phone ring anymore, I have to remember to shut the phone in the bathroom at night, don't know what out there is better, but it is definitely loud if that is what you are looking for."
2,had one,"it was always clear, but after 5-7 months it just stopped working. Own a Uniden now, love it. Not quite as clear tho."
4,I love the Batman series,"The artwork in this series is different. More anime style, but it is still Batman!!! I love it!"
4,It's Steve. What else can I say?,"While not the best way to get started on your collection of Steve Morse's music, for those of us who have everything else, it is a way to hear a cut or two you may not have.I didn't have the RUSH tribute cut in my collection, for example.Any Steve Morse cut is worth having.By the way, I just got to see Deep Purple again and that may be another way to add to your collection of Steve's music. All of their material from the last 10 years is heavily laced with Steve's influence."
4,Prime time!,"I just bought ""Prime Cuts"" and ""Rapture of the Deep"" by Deep Purple (featuring Morse on guitar). Both albums are enjoyable in different ways. ""Prime Cuts"" shows off Steve's guitar work on this instrumental disc. ""Rapture of the Deep"" shows Steve blending in with the other musicians of Deep Purple. A powerful rock album.""Prime Cuts"" = 4 1/2 stars""Rapture of the Deep"" = 5 stars"
3,Prime Cuts,I some-what find a lot of Kansas assimilation on this album. There is reasons for keeping in my music collection though.
5,Outstanding CD,"Steve Morse is an accomplished guitarist no doubt, depending on your taste. This CD is one of his best works. If you like Steve Morse, you'll love this CD."
5,15 Traditional Wedding Favorites,"I've been looking for this really ""old"" song that I remember having heard at a wedding 30 years ago. Then I found it here. Thanks for including the songs you chose for this CD."
5,Great,"Just wanted to say to reviewer: Aquarius Records, there is no sax on the album. Its a trumpet. Learn your intstruments buddy!"
2,Highlights are few and far between,"I bought this album based on raving reviews from all over, and boy was I disappointed. There is very little structure involved here, and the style does not in any way grab me. The best parts were the Jazz-influenced parts. The middle tracks had great stretches, but in between those stretches are crammed long, unneccessary, totally masturbatory stretches of over-the-top noise.Fifteen or twenty minutes of this album are worth listening to and are, dare I say, intriguing. The problem is wading through the rest of the garbage to find it.Some say this is ""experimental"". Experimental is nice if it is something that is both (a) novel and (b) worthwhile. A new invention can only be considered good if it brings some kind of practical value to its target constituents. If you like random meandering, you might enjoy this; if you want something with focus, look elsewhere."
1,Ave atque Vale,"This book and its author rather call to mind the scene in 101 Dalmations, in which dozens of dogs and their owners are shown to be amusingly similar in appearance and behaviour.Like many readers, I am put off by how vain and self-promoting the author is, reviewing poorly otherwise well-regarded books while dropping in coy references to his own seventeen year-old book. Philosophers can tend to be teleological in their view of themselves. This is understandable, but can be tiring. The book is average, certainly could be written better, I think there are better books on the subject. Look through his most damning reviews for a good indication of what those books are. He has, perhaps, also written reviews of his own book. He probably isn't the only philosopher to do that.I'm sure that such comments will inevitably trigger another twelve paragraph response of some form. I'm not certain that I'll come back to read it. I think he's had enough of my time by this stage.Ave atque vale."
5,Top 100 book,Excellent. A very good introduction to philosophy of science quite up to date with the newest scientific developments.
5,Fascinating Legal Thriller,"A very enjoyable read. You are drawn into the personality of the unlikely herione, Josie as she wends her way through the mystery and intrigue that the writer develops. You take an instant liking to her and root for the ""underdog"" as she strives to clear her innocent client's name. Michael Idoyaga develops the characters very well and the story is entertaining to the point you won't put it down. A must purchase."
5,Alvin is Still The Best,"Here's another old-school art tool set for the artist and craftsman. I do a lot of work with ink, pencil, spraypaint/airbrushing, embroidery, and so on, and there are plenty of times when I work with manual tools on an old-fashioned drawing board. Alvin curves were for many years the gold standard, and they still serve me well. Can't beat them."
5,nice and clear,nice set and i really liked how clear they are since i had one before that had measurements and marks on it so i needed a clear one
5,Great Product is as stated,i have been looking everywhere for this item and always came up short in finding the right curve i needed. well with this set it provides you with everything you would need in a french curve set. i highly recommend this item. you won't be sorry and the price is great and they are made very well and not made of cheap thin plastic that some companies try to sell you.
4,"Pricey, but still gotta have","What can one say about the Inspector Morse series? Breathtaking settings, finely crafted story lines, engaging characters - one can go on and on.These are pricey sets, notwithstanding that each one has 5 or 6 episodes, and considering somewhat marginal quality and the fact that they are not (and should be!) captioned. Nevertheless I'm hooked; I must have them all.5-stars for content; 1 for presentation."
2,SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME,"I really wanted another BOSE but just didn't want to shell out the big bux. I read many reviews & decided on this one. I liked the fact that it has a little remote. That said, I just don't use this player. I find the buttons small & counter-intuitive.The sound is another minus. Maybe its OK for a kid's room but it does not compare with the rich sound of the bose. I really want the one with the disk changer but I've read neg comments about the changer being too loud for a bedroom at night.My kid says to get an ipod thingy which will hold about a million CD's but I'm an old dog & don't like ""new tricks"". Maybe when I conquer the new cell phone I'll think about the ipod."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this unit for Christmas of 08 for my daughter of 14. Just 4 months later with as little as 3 hours of use the CD player stopped reading the disc. I subsequently read reviews of this unit and found several other people experienced the same problem. A call to customer service was disappointing. Not worth fixing and out of the 90 day warranty, buy a new one. Other than not reading the disc, the display was impossible to read without lifting the unit to a 45degree angle. Emerson could care less about customer satisfaction. If it was my company, and I sold hundred of thousands of these units I would replace a defective one at a nominal cost to the customer."
3,Good sound,"Good sound but not great.Remote is great,able to turn on, change stations, volume, etc. without haveing to go to the radio.For the price it is a good buy. Bought two----for kitchen and living room.CD and cassette player included."
4,good radio,"While certainly not the most amazing radio I have ever heard, it does its job well. I use this as my kitchen/ portable radio. I like that it has a cd player and a tape player. I can finally borrow books on tape from the library! If you are looking for a reasonably priced radio/ cd player/ tape player this is a good choice."
1,NO INSTRUCTIONS. CD won't play.,"WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INSTRUCTIONS???I put itunes music on it and it didn't play. Don't know how to put stuff on there in RW format and listen to it. The CD-RW doesn't play in this CD-RW player. If I had instructions, maybe I can use it. Who sells an item without instrucitons or a warranty? Bad customer service."
1,broken in two months,"Bought this item at the end of November to use while I give massage, and by early February it no longer worked. Amazon did not bother to return my email asking to return it."
3,Nice quality for the price!!,"Hi Gang, listen this radio met our expectations. Probably, don't need the tape player, but you never know. Only negative is the sound quality really can't be adjusted. It does feature a bass boost but really hardly does anything? A nice sound, but sometimes you like to tinker with the sound a bit. Anyway, this far exceeds the JWIN model which I bought and sent right back. The remote is a nice little perk. Very durable in every aspect! Nice price, and a few bells and whistles. Makes cooking in the kitchen so much better."
3,not so bad,"Sound quality isn't that great and there's no tone control other than a bass booster button. Some CDs skip that play well on other players. Tuner isn't very sensitive, can't pull in stations that are less than very strong. OK for a child or ""utility"" listening. This unit smells like perfume - it took a few weeks for it to offgas - not for fragrance sensitive people."
1,cd player didn't work,"Cassette player and radio worked, but the sound quality was just ok. Sent it back because the cd player did not work. Bought a Sony CFD-S350 for $20 more and am totally happy with that. The sound is so much better and it is easier to use than the Emerson. It was definitely worth the additional $20."
2,CD feature can't take the heat,"I bought 5 of these for my childcare center in April. The CD players in 2 are broken in June. (skipping, not reading, etc.) 2 months of use, even continuous use, is not durable enough for the price."
2,I like the size and portability but...,"I received this item and the second day, I was listening to the radio and the sound stopped so I went to check if the power was off but actually the speakers weren't working even after I pressed the volume buttons.Very disappointing. Price is ok, it could be better."
5,Emerson PD6560BL Portable CD,I've just recieved the player today and I'm very impressed with the sound. Its a Christmas gift for my mother and she'll love it.
3,Okay but not great,"Old school boombox. I get very frustrated that the presets don't hold when this gets unplugged, even with batteries in it. And don't expect the batteries to run the CD player for long."
5,One of the best CD's I have heard since AENIMA.,"If you ever thought that (1) Rumstein was the only band to come out of Germany. (2) Farmer Boys are a bunch of farmers who play there bangos around a fire.Then you should find a gun , a alley, and put an end to you exsistance. The way this CD has been musicly put together is amazing. They can move from a true heavy metal riff, straight into backing harmany giutars that would bring a tear to any church organist. Not only does farmer boys have a graet guitar line up, because there vocalist is also a forced to be reckonded with. The slight German acsent in his voice gives life to songs that just wouldn't be the same without it. Do yourself a favour and throw your money at these demi-gods of music. Now!"
2,Browning excelsior sleeping bags,"This is a really well made sleeping bag. It has a nice cover and great stuff bag and compression straps. The bag is roomy and comfortable within it's temperature comfort range. The problem is the temperature rating. I own the 0 rated bag and -30 bag. I have used the 0 bag in cool weather. At about 30 degrees the bag gets cold. I'm not sure how they came up with the rating. All the other bags I own are much closer in their rating. I haven't tried the -30 bag yet, but it doesn't appear to have anymore loft than the 30 degree rated one.Browning Excelsior 0-degree Oversized hooded Sleeping Bag"
3,Helpful.,This book is helpful when rusty on the topic and need a quick refresher. You still need a good text book to actually learn the material.
1,educational,This was deffinitely not worth the money. It had a gamey taste to it will never do it again.
1,KD screw starter,"Both the Slotted and the Phillips screw starter were both absolute JUNK. I was surprised because KD used to be a quality tool company. I recommend, DO NOT purchase these screw starters."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Don't order from 1800EMART. They will not send you what you order. They will send you a cheap generic charger that doesn't even look close to this one. When you contact them they just tell you to use it and let them know if it works.Well I better get paid to be a tester, not have to buy their product and risk my own to test it.The one star is for 1800EMART not the described product."
5,A second Mrs Miniver,"Irene Dunne gives a stunning performance in this almost second version of Mrs Miniver,Although the story covers the time period of both the first and second world wars..there are many similarities in in this patrioticbeautifully crafted and photographed productionAll the supporting cast are just right, the only let down is as in Mrs Miniver..Hollywoods idea of what actually Great Britain was actually like to both live in and be in during the war..this however is far outweighed by this highly enjoyable and very rarely seen filmIf you are a fan of Mrs Miniver then you will want to view and own this movieBoth print and sound quality are excellent,and its nice to have the theater trailer"
2,The white cliffs of dover,"Great film, dvd quality was poor. The dvd got stuck before loading and required several attempts to get started. Tried on several dvd and blue ray players the same problem."
4,The White Cliffs of Dover video,"The product is exactly what I needed. However, I understood that the video would be shipped within 24 hours of receiving my order. Since this was a birthday gift, I was counting on that to be true. I received the video 13 days after I ordered it, unfortunately 1 day late for the birthday party I attended. People should know to allow more time than is advertised for delivery. I was very disappointed."
1,From memory,"What makes a good review? Specifically: I would have loved to have known before I purchased the product (somewhere, as it's not listed in the DVD details) that this DVD was to be played by North Americans only. I had bought other ""old"" movies on Amazon with no problems enjoying them on my flat screen TV. Now, too late, I understand that they must have been Region 0 not region 1.The DVD did arrive on time with no lengthy waiting considering I am in the south of Australia. I had already informed my gathered ""film night get together"" family that this was a really great movie. As their Nanna would say ""somsink for ze hart"". Unfortunately as we sat there with our popcorn and mixed nuts at the ready the only information we got was ""incorrect format""."
5,They sound as good as they look... damn good,"Listening to them for the first time, i thought that they were an excellent band. Mark's voice is unbelievable and the rest of the band emphasize it. I give many props to Larry for his outstanding ability on the guitar, to Fish for the way he fingers those bass strings and to Doug for taming those drums."
5,A CD You Can Listen Tto All The Way Through,"COG's ""No Time At All"" is definitely a CD worth buying. You can listen to it all the way through because everyone song was wonderfully written and recorded. The band is full of talent and it shows. This is a great CD!"
3,Good Movie!!!,"This movie is good. I remember it from when i was younger. Its about a wanna be writer and a wanna be dancer named Lola. The guy sees her dance and can't get her out of his head so he looks for her (but the catch is when she danced she was wearing a mask). He eventually finds her (even though he doesn't realize its the woman he's been looking for until the end). They become quick friends and he tells her how he lied to his parents by telling them he was rich and had a girlfriend. So she agrees to pretend to be his girlfriend and let him borrow her house so he can look rich, all the while she is lying to him because she's really a housekeeper that is house sitting. They basically get caught in a bunch of lies while unintentionally falling in love. It is a very funny and romantic story!!"
5,Looking For Lola DVD,"DVD came fast and in perfect condition. Movie plays great! Love it!!! Such an average movie, and yet I can't stop watching it. :)"
1,Amateurish and silly,Do not waste your time with this movie. The plot is predictably and silly. Remind me of those college movies. The dance is poor and not worth any praise. I had trouble not sleeping through it.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Made too early into the Hays Code to revel in the exploitation side of women's prison movies, Caged is certainly lurid but it's also a solidly made, engaging picture that I guarentee will entertain you if you give it half a chance; besides, how can you pass up a movie whose tagline reads ""Will she come out a woman OR A WILDCAT?"""
2,A disappointment,"More should have been expected from Walton, one of the most interesting personalities in basketball. This sidesteps all sorts of interesting points in his career, leaving the reader still somewhat in the dark."
3,"Handy and comfortable, but bad sound quality","While the design and comfort are very good, the sound quality of these headphones cannot compare to others that i have owned before. I bought these because the cushioning on my old sony's had fallen apart, and those sounded better. The main reason for the awkward sound quality is that it's so offbalance, probably because of the XBS bass. Then again, I'm comparing these headphones to my big over-ear noise cancelling ones, so that may be the reason that they lack in comparison. Overall, its travel-fold design and tangle-free cord (it never tangles!) are a big plus, but the sound quality lowers its ratings."
1,They fell apart in less than a week,"I've had a Panasonic headphones in the past; and went out of my way to buy Panasonic again. However, on this pair, the ear cushion fell off in less than a week. I can not get it back on. Sound quality was good; I liked the retractable cord. The neckband was too big to be comfortable for a small adult."
5,A great book based on real life EMT stories,"This book based on stories that the authors have had in the life as EMT's. They tell about their feelings when responding to the calls,what their treatment was, and what the outcome was. As any pre-hospital professional knows, there always isn't a happy ending.This book is great for people entering the EMS field, or for those who have been in it for years. EMT: Race for Life will also let you know what it is like to be an EMT is a rural EMS service. This is the best EMS book that I have read in years!"
4,Excellent Book,I now have all of Lloyd and Herman's books. I am also a volunteer E.M.T. I read this book in approx. 2 nights. I thought it was excellent reading. I felt like I was right there treating the patients. If you are wondering what it's like to be a volunteer E.M.T. then this is book is a must read.
1,You've got to be kidding,"As a working EMT, I have no idea what world the authors are living in. The stories are all ""dumbed down"" to match about a third-grader's understanding, and many don't even make sense to someone with the slightest bit of medical training. I honestly don't believe there is any way that the authors ever ran a real call.If you really want to know what it is like on the streets, stick to Peter Canning's series."
5,Great gift,I bought this candle as a gift for a friend and I almost didn't give it to her! The fragrance was so wonderful I wanted to keep it for myself. I did part with it though and my friend loves it!
3,Worth the money,I guess you get what you ask for. The RAM is what I expected and performed as I had imagined. Worth the money!
2,Pricy for What You Are Getting,"I had bought this awhile back for my old 486. I was expecting a major increase in performance, but I didn't see it that much. They said it would run at Pentium performance, but a true Pentium 60 can outrun it because of its better architecture. The cpu used in this, the AMD 5x86 133MHz isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer any way. A 486 25 or 33mhz bus speed can't keep up with the cpu. That letz-go guy ahead of me said to get more memory. Now you see, once you buy this cpu and more memory (which is difficult to find and expensive to buy), you'll be spending well over $150 dollars. Now who wants to upgrade something that will still be 3 or 4 years out of date, can't run most modern software, and can't use modern hardware. You can buy a brand new, 600Mhz or faster computer for around $400. After which you'll certainly be glad that you had done so, trust me."
2,Skip the CPU Upgrade and just buy a new PC!,"I wouldn't buy a CPU upgrade for a 486 CPU because when you install it you will still be outdated because you'd only get up to 133MHz of speed, and now they have 800MHz and faster CPU's out. So why waste your money on this and just put it towards a brand new computer. You'll be glad that you did!"
2,Rare Dennis Wilson song,"To much disco which I admit I dislike, however, Curt does it as well as anybody. I was surprized to hear The Dennis Wilson song ""Mexico"" in the instrumental ""California Music""."
5,A wonderful story of love and self-sacrifice.,"A young woman is tricked into a compromising position with a man she has secretly loved for many years. When Lord Berrington 'does the right thing' and proposes to her, Belinda, for once in her life, makes a decision with only her heart in mind. She loves Lord Berrington, and would rather be married to him knowing that he doesn't love her, than to not have him in her life. Once married, she vows to herself to allow Lord Berrington to live his life as he will, while keeping her love for him secret in her heart. I loved this story. I like the way Belinda grew into her own. She was a very insecure young woman, that grew into her own person despite being surrounded by distrust and hate. In the end, her self-sacrifice is rewarded. A wonderful story I recommend to others looking for a happily ever after ending."
5,A Great Read,"I loved Forced Offer... When the worries of the world are getting to you, there is nothing like escaping to another time and place... The characters develop quickly, the tension is palpable, and the resolution is truly satisfying... A great bargain for a few great hours of time away from the woes of the real world! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I've read it a few times and STILL enjoy it!"
4,"Pretty good, but...","I can't help feeling this tape could've, and should've, been a little bit longer. I mean, it isn't as though there aren't plenty of other superb MSTed shorts (""Mr. B. Natural"", ""Posture Pals"", the two ""Hired"" entries) that merit inclusion. And some of what was included, including ""Catching Trouble"" and ""The Days Of Our Years"", isn't exactly top-notch.Those quibbles aside, this compilation still boasts plenty of laughs and is well worth seeking out for fans of the show. Now, if only Rhino would issue a DVD with ALL the shorts included..."
4,Liquid seaweed plant food,"Great, natural food for plants and I saw results in a few short weeks. If you use some of the blue powder feed so many use on your houseplants you are doing them an injustice. After a few months you will notice yellowing and lackluster growth, that is because you are adding a lot of salts to you soil. Mix 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water and run through soil a few times to rinse out the salts (best to do this outside) use a natural product like ""Liquid Seaweed"" and you won't be sorry.The only negative is this product 1 oz. to a gallon water is very, very dark so you should be careful not to spill any on carpet, etc. other than this it is great."
1,garbage,"It is not anything like they show in the picture. I received a white bottle that was taped shut and leaking all over the place. The box was wet and liquid seaweed was dripping everywhere as I opened it. After using it the first time one capfull for one gallon, most of my plants died.......the next day. I had everything from tomatoes to bell peppers and even some basil and thyme, all dead. So I'm not sure what I got in that bottle but it doesn't seem to be any good."
5,Awesome,"This stuff is great. I started a small test aquaponics system and I am doing fishless/seeding cycling. Man, those tomatoes took off like crazy. So, I haven't even started getting nitrites in my system yet let alone nitrates and this stuff is making my plants just zoom up and they all look healthy."
4,"A good, quick read","Really enjoyed it. The style seems to be aimed at the young adult market and, thus, is different from some of his other books. The chapters involving the Battle of the Crater were especially interesting - and damning to the officers who decided to send in untrained troops instead of the colored regiments that had been training for days."
2,Binder Clips,"The Clips were not what they look like in the pics and some of the clips were broken in the container when we open them up, they look very cheap and distorted! Would not buy from them again for this product."
4,"John Easdale's ""Bright Side"" rocks harder than you think!!","John Easdale formerly of Dramarama has done a fabulous job on his latest CD call ""Bright Side"". The masterful lyricst has written some classic rock tunes that will keep you coming back again and again. Tunes like Call me Dave will just blow you away from the speakers and have you bopping to the beat. The beautiful meshing of Easdale's voice and music will also affirm the veteran's ability to compose great flowing tunes. The song ""Waiting For That Sound"" is a play on the actual music itself but won't keep you waiting for the next song!! This album is must for any rock n roll fan!!!"
4,"the ""typical"" aussie family?",i saw this movie while i was living in australia. it gets more and more funny each time you see it!
4,The Castle becomes timely with Supreme Court decision,"Though The Castle is set is Australia, it resonates this year with Americans who were stunned by the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court to allow citizens' homes to be taken by eminent domain and given to private developers for some alleged public use. We should identify with the Kerrigan family's desire to be left alone to enjoy their house and property, and their determination to fight back. Barbara Anderson, Massachusetts."
3,a trip out film,saw this film late one night last week and I hadn't payed it much attention and then something told me to check this film out and I was laughing big time. the family is a trip and there different journeys is a real trip. i dug how everybody in the neighborhood is fighting for there property.
2,"Terrific movie, American version is bad though","This is a great movie, I rented it when visiting a friend in Australia. I have since rented the US version, and it is not the same movie. As the other reviews say, much has been changed. Even the music has been replaced, so I've heard (its been years since I saw the original version so I wouldn't have caught that on my own). The Australian feel to it helped make it great. Now they've dubbed over everything with American phrases and names, and have simply cut out a few other things. There is now a DVD of it out in Australia, but it isn't widescreen. However, as much as I love widescreen, I'd rather hear the original soundtrack and have the scenes in place. A DVD with both versions for Americans would be nice even, though I'd never watch the American release as it sucks. Don't watch the US version!"
4,"excellent film, so-so dvd","I really enjoyed this film. The main characters are sort of like The Simpsons, but without the sarcasm and malice; they are simple, unpretentious folk who know what family is all about. It's a real charmer, and it even made me a little teary-eyed at the wrapup. The only problem: the picture quality is not much better than what you would find on videotape. It's adequate, and that's a real shame, because for all this film's good points, all throughout I kept wondering why they couldn't get a clearer print. But all in all, it's worth buying it, sight unseen."
3,A good film,"I've only seen the original Australian version which was released around 3 years before it was in the US. I understand they have added a fair bit of music and changed a fair few lines so Americans can get the jokes. It's a good film without being great, probably the 2nd best Aussie film ever behind Crocodile Dundee, but if anyone has seen many Aussie films that's not saying much. For the very small budget they had they did an okay job with everything. Would recommend, although maybe not to buy, just rent."
4,A great laugh,"Without a doubt this is the funniest Australian movie of all time. I have watched it so many times I almost know it off by heart. This launched the film careers of Eric Bana and Stephen Curry and made Michael Caton a household name. I dont know anyone who doesn't like this movie so if you want to familiarise yourself with some Aussie humour, make sure you add this one to your collection. It is not a movie you can watch just once, you will want to watch it again and again. Sadly no special features however, that is why the no 5th star.Get the Australian region 4 version if you can. I believe a lot of the original dialogue has been hacked and changed to suit American audiences. You will be missing what makes the movie so great."
5,Tell him he's dreaming!,"The Castle is a satire of the 'modern' family in particular the Australian suburbia family that is extremely funny. I saw this on video after spending a few months in Australia but it contains a number of issues that the average American could relate to. It is one of those movies with several memorable lines that you can quote for ages, but its just as funny the second and third time around. Its well worth checking out!"
2,The Castle - Not for Everyone,"I understand why some feel this movie gets high ratings for its parody of modern family relations. The previous reviews provide pretty good details of why they think so. But if you like the types of jokes and humour in the movie, be prepared to hear them again, and again and again......I got tired of the repetition 20 minutes into the show. My Australian relations could see the potential draw for watching such a movie, but were not themselves amused by it. If you're thinking of purchasing this movie, rent it first to make sure you like the humour. If you don't like the humour (and I found it tiresome) , you'll be sorry you bought it. The level of acting and general fiming of the movie is not a reason to make the purchase."
3,"""Interesting"" is key word here!","After seeing ""Precious"", I wanted to read more of ""Precious'"" author. I am not one who is discouraged from foul language or content. I would have enjoyed this in my late teens or mid-20's during my rebel years.As a 36 year old, I was setback due to the language used by characters in essays/poems composed here. I laughed at some of the dialogue used until it got old.I felt sorry for some of these ignorant people who don't get past their stupidity. Opened up my eyes to ignorance is learned from generation to generation. Therefore, sterilization should be imposed on all of humanity after third child or if you can't even take care of yourself."
5,ELECTRIFYING! A SOUL STIRRING ROLLERCOASTER RIDE OF BEAUTY,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER EVER READ OF POETRY AND SHORT STORIES THAT EXPLORE ISSUES OF SEXISM AND RACISM AND OVERALL HUMAN-ISM'S. THIS IS A TREASURE, THE MOZART, THE COLTRANE, THE HENDRIX OF BOOKS, CREME DE LA CREME. SAPPHIRE ADD A NEW #1 FAN TO YOUR LIST!!! YOU ARE THE BOMMMMMBBBBBB, BABEE!!!!"
1,A Nightmare,Just reading some of this author's so called poems could depress anyone. I realize some of the things she writes about happens but who wants to read about it in a poem. A poem is suppose to be beautiful. This stuff is crap too depressing....sorry......not something I want to curl up to and read on a rainy day. Life is depressing enough woman.
1,I never recieved my order,"I never recieved this purchase,they were supposed to be delivered on Oct. 15,2010,they still have not arrived,I now recieved a communication from this seller stating they had been returned to them because they had been damaged in shipment,WTF do they expect when they ship USPS.I will never order from this seller again,they still haven't credited my account for the purchase that was returned to them,so they say,actually I think their excuse is BS.No I'm not happy about my first time experience with this seller,and to make sure this never happens again to me through Amazon,I am closing my Amazon account and never buying from them or their sellers."
1,Buyer Beware - GMO,I just learned that this Hum Cola Syrup is made with high fructose corn syrup. It seems that a much better option is the Monin Sugar Cane Cola Syrup which has been noted as not having any GMO ingredients (genetically modified organism) such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Shame on Hum for not labeling this product with a GMO label!
5,Cola Syrup,"My grandmother and mother always kept this on hand as it works. We have not been able to find it locally in many years and now have this supplier. For minor complains of upset stomach this cannot be beat. Even if you now are the grandparents, you can continue this treatment that worked when you were a child."
2,"Worthless for musicians: no IPA, and very little other pronunciation help","I bought this dictionary to use when working on vocal music in Italian. I've used other Cassell's dictionaries before, so I assumed this would be just as good. Unfortunately the Italian portion of the dictionary gives very little information about pronunciation. The author's lame excuse for this is that Italian is ""almost phonetic"" -- which is true, but the ""almost"" part of that statement is very important. For singers, it is very important to know what vowel to sing. In Italian, the letters E and O may be pronounced either open (as in the English words ""get"" and ""cotton"") or closed (roughly as in ""gate"" or ""coat""). This is not a trivial difference; what's more, there are no 100% effective ""rules"" to tell you which version of the vowel to use in any given case. You have to.... that's right, consult a dictionary. Unfortunately this one is no help."
5,great for class work,very helpful intro book carry this with me every trip here.you can count it for quick words and simple quotes.
2,Computer games and movies don`t mix,"I didn`t expect much from this film, and I was right. The story and plot are not very good and the acting was so-so at best.Even a little on the poor side for a B movie. You know a movie is in trouble when you look at the out takes in the specialfeatures and the out takes might well have been better than what they actually put in the film.It`s not god awful, I did manage to watch it all the way to the end. I guess it rates 2 stars instead of 1, just barely."
5,Inspirational book,"As a contributor to The Compassion of Dogs, I had the opportunity to read the entire book. I was deeply touched by each of these stories, which were unique in their own way. As an owner of dogs, I was also able to personally understand and identify with aspects of the humane/canine bonds that were so beautifully described. I encourage anyone who loves dogs, to buy this book for themselves and as a gift for others. Each individual story is inspirational, touching, and worthy of remembering."
1,Toss in garbage can,"Ok, I will get straight to the point and say that you should NOT buy this book. Ashida Kim is not Asian, and his name comes from 2 different countires (Ashida=Japan, Kim=Korea). Now, Stephan Hayes is also not Asian, but has practiced NinjUtsu. Ashida Kim does not even say in his books how he got to be a ninja. He writes this farfetched stories that couldn't even get published in a fictional book.Save your money. You want NinjUtsu, not NinjItsu, go to Hatsumi or Hayes. Not Kim."
4,Best kept comedy secret on Long Island!,"I really enjoyed this great story about an average guy like you and me who has the guts to pursue his dream while keeping his 'day job' and juggling his family life, too. I've also had the chance to check out Moltzen's act - very funny, and the humor isn't lost in the translation to his book. Ed's writing style is warm and funny. Definitely worth the read."
5,A GREAT READ,Ed really tells it likes it is in this book. As a comic working in the industry I can totally agree with and empathize when it comes to some of the hell gigs that Ed describes. A fun read.
3,enact the ritual of near-sleep,"This is a collection from interchill of global space-out, meditateand ease off into haze pieces. Some perform the function of backgroundmusic for blissed-out conversations; others' benefits are in the soporific;while a good number enact the ritual of near-sleep and slow-drip comfort.There is the piano laden Fluxation by Lumo from UK, and the song Steeps' glidinghallucinogenic sounds of someone freaking out and what sounds like another getting theirteeth cleaned are really beatboxing, voices by Andreanne Alainand music by Freeworm of Montreal. There are the snips and snaps of Watershellfrom Toronto and the particularly trippy Omnimotion trackcalled Underdub. Some of the other artists featured are from Romania, New Zealand,and Czech Republic.MM,May 29/02"
5,#1 Christian Artist and Writer,"Bruce has uplifting and prevelant music for today. People from teen to 50+ can relate to the music he writes and signs. He is the ""James Taylor"" of Christian music. Love His Praise Filled, Faith Moving music!"
3,A good effort but not the best.,For the price you would expect more. But what it dose it dose well. You'd be best of spending that bit more and bying a Psion 3c or 3x than this. But a good effort non the lessCome to think of it anything would be better
4,Great for storage,I mostly bought this to store my telescope. It does have some padding to protect it from minor dings and mostly to keep the dust from collecting. It is very nice for transporting and it gives you some sense of comfort.
3,Still Mediocre,"This isn't really a review...it's just me complaining so here I go.I hate it when TV shows/movies use the old staples of ""we only use 10% of our brain"" and ""why is the sky blue"". We use more than 10% of our brain. That has been proven and is just a false statement ([...]). As for the sky being blue, the explanation is called Rayleigh Scatter or small particle scatter. Small particles in the atmosphere scatter light, and these small particles are more likely to scatter radiation of shorter wavelengths such as blues and violets. The eye picks us the scattering and sees the sky as blue.As for the show itself...it's getting better than the pilot but not by much. Still seems like some missed potential."
4,"Good show, good stars","I was a bit sad, but not surprised when this was canceled. Since the movie Terminator Salvation was due to be out, this show must have got put on the back burner, and subsequently cancelled. As far as I know, they were going to make season 3 but didn't due to lack of ratings. The stories and action sequences were on par, some even on par with an expensive movie flic.I mainly watched this show for Summer Glau though, is that a bad thing?"
4,Very good for a debut season,"I understand that people may find the tv show lacking in comparison to T1 or T2, but after sitting through Terminator Salvation this series seems like a mini masterpiece.The special effects, considering the budget of the series, are very good and I also thought the actors were great and perfect for their chosen parts. What makes this show so good though, are the stories. They are well written, daring and always entertaining. My only reservation is the lack of extras, but from what I understand the blu-ray is loaded with them."
5,Great character development in depth,"While there is a lot of fun shoot 'em up, the writing is surprisingly good and the acting is -quite- good. These are not your 2D comic book heroes. The characters have inner conflict that surfaces and is portrayed with a surprising range of emotion. A good ensemble cast.Too bad the series was canceled after two seasons. The second season was much stronger than the first, and the show finale set the stage for a whole host of interesting and new directions."
5,Awesome series!,"Another awesome series brought to a pre-mature end by the short-sighted Excutives of our ""Entertainment"" World! It is a shame such shows are dropped."
3,unable to view,Unable to view movie. movie Player kept crashing. All go back and try watching again abs at that time will grade according my.
2,"Pilot was good, but same sad writing as other dumb shows.","I had seen a few of the Terminator TV shows over the years but this was my first chance to watch them from the beginning of the series. The pilot show was good but it was downhill from there. It's like all the dumb shows, like ""24"" where the blond screws up every key moment and the show drags on for another week. I blame the writers and directors, not the actors. I will not watch another episode since Episode #2 killed it for me."
5,good all the way around,"Ok, there's only 9 episodes but the story and action are very good with just a touch of humor. Sarah Connor is played by the woman who played the queen in the movie 300. Summer Glau (Terminator) is best known from her days in Firefly and Serenity. The Blu-ray quality is is also very good."
4,would be 5 stars with season 3!,"I cant believe I never watched this before. Great series. Not perfect, but I wish i could get in a bubble travel back a couple years, and get everyone to watch this. Maybe then, Fox wouldn't have terminated my new favorite show =(PS I love Summer Glau & Amazon Prime <3"
4,Terminator - The Sarah Conner Chronicles (first season),"Summer Glau is the factor in this T.V. program that makes it so good, just like her part in the Fire Fly and Serenity. I was pleased with the timely arrival of the product and the price was fair."
4,Surprisingly good for a movie inspired TV series.,"Usually, movie-inspired TV shows are like their video game counterparts, i.e. a cheap means of conning unwary viewers/buyers. Occasionally, we are pleasantly surprised by the quality of the work. Buffy comes to mind. And now, Sarah Connor Chronicles has the potential to do it as well.The writing is superb. The acting is generally above par. The special effects are not major motion picture caliber but serviceable. Only the young John Connor is a little weak. Lena Headey's physique also compares unfavorably against Linda Hamilton in Judgment Day, but these are minor issues easy to overlook. Let's just hope that the series does not suffer a second season collapse a la Heroes."
4,"A good follow up of T2, great!","I have enjoyed this Terminator tv series, I can't wait for the second season, having said that it does not have the intensity of T1 or T2, but still great to watch, all you have to remember is that it is a tv show after all."
5,Terminator Sarah Connors Season 1,Thank you for the fast service. The product was in perfect condition. We are enjoying watching the series and are able to catch up on the ones that we missed when the series was running on TV.
5,Get this if you want season 3,"One of the best ways to ensure this show's survival to a third season is to buy this DVD. Buying DVD sets saved Family Guy, led to a movie the movie Serenity, and much more. Hopefully it can do the same for this amazing show!"

4,Sara Connor Chronicle,The rating on this DVD set was spot on. It is like new and we had no issues. Thank you
4,Summer Glau is the best!,"Terminator is a pretty entertaining, interesting show. Its one of the last shows I've watched and not been on my laptop the entire time! I can't wait for season 2 on blu ray!"
3,SCC - 1st Season,"Slow start ... do not think the casting pick for Sara Connor was a particularly a good one ... too much deviation in character from Linda Hamilton. Lots of eye candy scenes. All told, DVDs are worth the money if you a person like I am that wass reached the point of being fed up with commercial breaks in TV. Almost like the audience is treated as a whole as suffering from Adult ADD."
4,good movie,it was so excited that I went over the all of stories at once. The seller is very nice and reliable. Quick delivery.
3,Problems with this storyliine,"I haven't decided whether I like this series or not, I've only watched a couple episodes thus far. But I'm having major issue with what they're doing sending engineer's, helpers and everyone else back through time portals to stage stuff for John and Sarah. If they could do that... why not just send the army of future soldiers back and finish the job to begin with? This is really bugging me. I thought the movie series showed that time travel was extremely difficult. But in this storyline it's easy. At the end of the first episode they even use time travel to escape. Not as difficult as we were led to believe in the movies. Cheapens the whole Terminator universe with this introduced."
4,"AWESOME show, ANNOYING blu-ray.","No menu option to select specific episodes. Just a single PLAY button. If you want to watch the third episode on the disc, you have to fast-forward or chapter-skip until you get there. Stupid.Great image quality. Great show."
5,Surprising sleeper hit for me.,"I fully expected this to be horrible (like the Bionic Woman).To my surprise, this was a great show (unfortunately way too short. Thank you Writers Strike).I have 3 reasons to buy this.1. Great show2. Blu-Ray3. My DVR crapped out on me before I got the chance to watch he last episode. Talk about MAD.This was a great show to fill the void when ""24"" was clearly going to have to wait another year or so for better writing.$27.95 is not cheap. But you are getting over 6 hours of viewing. That's very good when you compair it to any other Blu-Rays priced at $27.95."
5,Terminator - Sarah Connor Chronicles,"Great DVD -- so sad that this great show got cancelled before it's time. I hope that SciFi would consider picking this up. I love Buffy and Joss Whedon; but Fox made BIG MISTAKE by cancelling this show, instead of Dollhouse. Having both shows on Friday night made my day. Now I will make sure to watch Ghost Whisperer and maybe tune in to Dollhouse. Can't wait for the Season 2 DVD of Sarah Connor to come out. I will miss this great show, RIP Terminator."
5,Wow!,"If you like the Terminator genre then you should love this series. It is very hard to watch one episode, always leaves you wondering what will happen next."
5,Consider me gobsmacked,"This is sheerly astounding television. I can barely believed they fit as much as they did into a nine episode season. At this price, you shouldn't even think twice. A great show with a great DVD box set."
4,Very Happy,"Hello,i was very happy with the time of Delivery and the product itself.don know what more to say ....thanks Craig"
3,"plot unfinish, poor effect","the idea is good, but 9 chapter with a plot doesn't finish for 1st season, also the special effect isn't match far from the movies."
3,Good series but......,"if I were the guy playing John Connor, I'd be pissed that only my back is shown on the front cover. What's up with that?"
1,There is no ending for this show,This was a great show in my opinion...but they cancelled the show. I was cancelled so quickly that it really doesn't have an ending...there is no closure. :)
4,Love this show!,"Don't know why FOX would consider canceling this one, it does a great job of expanding the Terminator mythos. More cerebral than most shows on the air, and Summer Glau does an amazing job of being a ""very scary robot"" despite her less than intimidating physical frame."
1,Not for the book or terminator movies' fans,"Now I remember why I never watched past the pilot. This series lacks convincing actors among other things, not worth the time or money.What's to dislike:CheesyPoorly writtenPoor actinglacks actionRecommended for the younger audience (<16 y/o)"
1,Dud,"I downloaded the free pilot and didn't care much for it. I even watched another couple of episodes since the writers strike is stil going strong and there is not much else on.I really like sci-fi, but I just couldn't get into this show."
1,Very unhappy with results,"This came as an incomplete order. The package should have had 3 disks in it and only had two. It was a birthday gift, so it was very embarassing. Not happy at all."
3,Mehh...,"The female terminator is the best part as both the John and Sarah Connor charaters are cringful in both action and verbal delivery. Action sequences are very well done for a T.V. series but the plot is dragging. No need to buy this at full price, as I'm sure ebay will be flooded by the end of the month."
1,Good if yopu need to sleep,I can't believe this is still on TV. Reminds me of cheezy 70's B-movie sci-fi. Where they try to get a pretty face to cover up the poor writing and plot. Doesn't follow the movie plot and is only good for puting you to sleep from bordom.
3,"not like the movies, obviously","It was nothing like the movies but I still enjoyed it, was disappointed that it didn't succeed and it was cancelled"
3,Better than second season,"I remember liking this one at the start, it even tied in pretty well with the movies. Lena Headey did a pretty good Sarah Connor and Summer Glau was perfect as the friendly terminator (I think one of the extras on the first or second season DVD sets said the role was written with her in mind.)- too bad the series took so dark a turn in second season."
3,Good series,"I am not sure how this show didn't make more than 2 seasons. It is pretty cool and definitely worth watching. The only drawback is that John seems a bit petulant and difficult to like (unlike the boy in T2). You also MUST suspend disbelief; physics don't work here and the plots often have glaring holes. Why watch it if there are problems? It is cotton candy for the mind that should just be enjoyed. I remember this series when it was first run; they moved it from time slot to time slot making it very difficult to keep track of. At least now we can watch it in sequence and without commercials. Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed."
4,You'll just love getting your weekly dose of Terminator,"Surprisingly this series is actually good, heck it's great. I didn't know what to expect, cause we all know The Terminator franchise is a lot to live up to. But this show simply delivers in all categories. It has action thanks to Sarah Conner and Cameron(the terminator). Drama between John and everyone who wants to protect him. Suspense cause you never know when they will be attacked next. As well as mystery cause to be honest, you think you know what's going on. But you really don't.Also since it's a series you have way more character development, than you would have in the movies. So even thou the show is called Sarah Conner Chronicles. It's really about John Conner and how he develops into the man that will eventually lead us to victory over the machines."
5,Steve Vai's Favored Nations Compilation!,"Greg Koch records for and is produced by Steve Vai and his Favored Nation label. On this CD Steve Vai personally assembles 17 of Koch's best numbers.The tunes are varied and do not represent any one particular style. ""Zoiks"" for example is a full blown shred fest that might comfortably appear on any of Vai's own CD's. ""Carlos Dale"" on the other hand is, as the name implies, a warped sense of what might happen if Carlos Santana and Dick Dale collided on stage. ""Spanish Castle Magic"" and ""Big Jim"" are tributes of sorts to Jimi Hendrix while ""Steppin' Out"" pays its respect to Eric Clapton. Finally, ""Chef's Blues"", ""Albert's Back"", ""Walking Wounded"" and ""Blind Lemon Pledge"" all play tribute to various blues musicians. The music is at all times up tempo, interesting and fun.The tone achieved by this musician thoughout the CD are second to none regardless of the stlye being played. This is highly recommended for guitar fans everywhere."
5,Sick Sick Sick,If you get this you are going go to stay home from work to listen to it because it is so good it is absolutely sick.
4,"The Grip! surprising album, my review from Barcelona","What a wonderful surprise this GREG KOCH's CD. `The Grip' is not a typical Blues album. It includes several styles but it sure is a terrific guitar exhibition from beginning to end. It's been a long time since I heard such an amazing first track: ""Zoiks"", brilliant. ""Spank It"" is phenomenal; the slow Blues ""Chef's Blues"" is enthralling; there are very good tributes to Jimmy Hendrix in ""Spanish Castle Magic"" and ""Big Jim""; to Eric Clapton in ""Steppin' Out""; and to Albert King in ""Albert's Back""; heavenly sound in ""Drawn My Number""; a little of high level hard Blues in ""The Grip"" and so on. In a few words, a very entertaining and interesting record. I recommend it and I give it 4,5 stars."
5,You will be sorry if you do not buy this CD NOW!!!!,"After reading the article about Greg Koch in Guitar Player magazine, I took the chance and purchased this CD unheard. If you are a fan of instrumental guitar music (although there is one cut with vocals), you've got to have this one. Trust me, you will love it. When I first heard this CD, I more or less catergorized the playing as possibly the Hellecasters on steroids. But the more I listen to it, it is in a class by itself. A difficult CD to describe so all I can suggest is that you get a hold of it as quickly as you possibly can. ""Tonus Diabolicus"" is spectacular, ""Spank It"" is phenomenal. The songs are musical as opposed to being just shred for shreds sake."
3,A bit formulaic... but appropriate for the status quo,"While there was some good information to be gleaned from this book, I found the methods presented rather formulaic... but given the current crop of formulaic, predictable and commercially tied-in animated movies in the past few years, I guess it's appropriate. I also found the driver/city block metaphor rather irritating after a while. But still, some useful ideas in here, hopefully one can learn ""The Rules"" to be able to break them and try to go outside the status quo and create something that isn't geared towards selling more toys to kids. Not surprising that the entire genre of adult animation was ignored (i.e., Anime, Bakshi, ""Heavy Metal"") since it's not commercially viable."
1,Please!!! Save Your Money!!! Marilyn Webber is TV Writing's Biggest Cookie-Cutter!!!,"How many books can she write that are the same information, only with a genre-specific twist? First she writes a general TV book and then she writes a book on sitcom writing - BOTH using this utterly stupid ""roadmap"" model. I've even been dumb enough to plunk money down on her live seminar in which she essentially reads from her own book. She latched on to this ""roadmap"" notion like a pitbull a LONG time ago and she STILL can't let go.THEN she has the utter gall to write yet another book, this time applying the same hackneyed techniques to the field of animation writing.When I was in college, using the same paper for three different classes would have been considered plagarizing oneself. It's amazing that her publisher hasn't caught on...Save your money. Or buy Jefferey Scott's book."
3,I was expecting more...,"Although I am well aware the author of this book was NOT an author by trade, this book seemed to be a bit on the ""rough"" side. By this, I mean, I found many passages repeated, stories as well,and found it not to be very enlightening at all. This author spent more time talking about herself, and her family etc than she did about Danvers. It seemed that too many references to her parents and family were uneccessary. I don't know WHO edited this book, but I sure hope they weren't paid for it.On the whole, this woman obviously felt the need to tell her story, but I found her story typical and stale. She tells of out-of-control patients...NO KIDDING. It's ""DANVERS"". Perhaps my expectations were a bit high, who knows...I guess she thought it would be a good read. SO did I, but now wish I had saved my money. I'm reselling it on Ebay."
1,Danvers State,"I was not impressed with this book. Maybe I expected more about the history of Danvers State, this book was just as it states Memoirs of a nurse in the asylum. It is all about the nurse's every day life working & raising a family. I was dissapointed I thought there would be more about the history of the hospital."
1,danvers state,"I was very dissapointed with this book. I am a registered nurse and did my psychiatric rotation at Danvers State Hospital in 1971 - 1972. I was expecting a book about this historic yet controversial state institution. Instead I got a boring autobiography of this womans life, her marriage, and her chidren growing up with little snipits of how Danvers fit in. I was expecting an in depth look at this facility, especially since I started my rotation as a student nurse the same year that the author resigned from Danvers."
1,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. It is extremely short, since it is double-spaced. Very quickly read it. I expected some stories of patients but stories were about one paragraph without much information. Information was repeated several times. I appreciate the story about her upbringing and family, but wanted more information on the patients. Book is way too brief."
2,Disappointed,"I was anticipating a much more detailed history of Danvers, considering the author actually worked there. I think the book has some good information but it is really just some excerts from her memory, no details or longer explanations."
2,A Major Disappointment,"Even after reading the dismal reviews for Danvers State, I still decided to give the book a chance. I wholeheartedly regret that decision. Reviews said that the book was poorly written, and they are correct. Previous readers claim that there was a lot or repetition, and there is. I also noticed that the author wasted a lot of print reliving family stories that had no bearing on the book itself. The reading level of the book was so low that I finished it in a few hours. This could have been a great book, but its shortcomings reduce it to something almost unreadable."
3,Danvers State Insane Asylum,"Danvers State Insane Asylum is in the process of being torn down, with only one-third of the Kirkbride Building to be restored by Avalon Bay Company for apartments. This building is (was) on the Register of Historic Places and is a beautiful example of Victorian architecture. I signed the petition to preserve the entire buiding, but to no avail. Therefore, I wanted to get any information I could about the running of the Asylum. This book is very informative with regard to patient care -- I wish Ms. Szot could have been more descriptive with regard to the Kirkbride building or the outbuildings. However, if you are interested in the Danvers Asylum, this is a must have book."
3,A good book that was mis-marketed,"I am glad that the way Amazon describes this book as being a devotion book. Other marketing techniques I have seen (especially in the Christian media arena) in my part of the country concerning this book portrayed this book as a book and not as a devotional guide that it really is. Therefore, I proceeded to read the book as a book until finding out that the book is a devotional. I was wondering why the chemistry seemed lacking as I read the first couple of chapters. When I began reading this book as a devotional book, the writings took new meaning and I was able to grasp some of the author's insights while the author left me more confused in other areas."
4,cant beat the price,"these are a great value for the price. some might think them flimsy, but i think they are a great value for so many of them. might not hold a whole stack o' papers but you get what you get for the money."
5,"Useful, multi colored binder clips","These are nice, colorful mini binder clips that are a must for any office environment. They do what they are supposed to do: hold papers together."
3,Small,"These particular ones are way smaller than I expected from the picture. You might be able to clamp 10-15 pages or so. The picture makes them look much bigger, so beware! Good quality, just small."
5,Great Product,I got this MP3 player and I really love this. The operations are cool. The manual that comes with the item is very user friendly. It has a in built mike and the recording is great the voice quality is very gud. It has been 6 motnhs since I have this item and I have no problems wht so ever with this.
4,a review that actually addresses the music,"matthew dear's earlier material (released mainly on vinyl) is straight-up minimal techno, but lately he's been going with a poppier approach with the addition of vocals. he sings on almost all the songs here, and there are lots of other nice touches, like guitar (i think) in ""tide"", and horns and latin percussion in ""and in the night"". there are lots of quirky melodies and interesting production effects. this music is very modern, individualistic, catchy, often dancy, and sometimes a bit spooky."
1,The worst CD ever!!!,"I cannot believe the crap that this label has been putting out. The only reason that this label started is because the owner's dad has a lot of money to throw around...The only reason people buy this stuff is because they are tricked into thinking this stuff is good...Ghostly pays magazines and newspapers to write good reviews about their work. If a magazine writes a bad review of their work, the money that Ghostly gives them stops coming in... So a CD like this that has been given a 10/10 in URB should have actually received a 2/10.You want to listen to some real music? Well, you can start by NOT purchasing this CD."
4,I love it,"I bought this receiver cause it had a very low price. I just wanted to replace my time damaged Clarion receiver and didn't have enough money to get another of the same brand. I thought this would be a 4-6 weeks temporary radio while I got the money but now it's staying right where it is.I like the way it sounds and it's pretty easy to set up. If for some reason you have to disconnect your car's battery you can set the radio to your likings in less than 2 minutes.The controls are easy to understand and not hard to reach while you are driving. The anti skip feature of the CD player has been tested in virtually destroyed roads, and it has performed great.It doesn't get the 5 stars rate just because its lights are very bright while driving at night. Edit: I dismounted the faceplate and covered the back of the buttons using some white nail polish. Now the glare is in the past.I recommend this console even if you have the money for a more expensive one."
4,Reasonable,"The price compared to the quality is very reasonable.Dash looks pretty nice. Buttons are quite small, so a little bit hard to select songs.Haven't checked if possible to choose songs by number.Can read CD-R with no problem, for me that's the most important thing.About the i-Plug, it's actually just an extra cord connected to an adapter, NOT on the dash.Sound quality is ok for me, not truly great (No bass, sounds quite flat -partially because of the speakers in my car)Overall, it's WORTH buying for those who just need a CD/MP3 Player to play with. If you're a professional, perhaps brandname is better."
2,No es lo que esperaba,"Antes de comprar este radio lei muchos review para estar seguro que era lo que iba a comprar, despue de tanto leer me decidi a comprarlo.Al instalarlo me lleve la sorpresa de que no era todo lo que yo esperaba.Anteriormente tenia un Pionner instalado ese radio muy raras veces brincaba o el disco saltaba cuando me iba en un hueco o transitaba por calle mala, con el Dual es imposible transitar calle mala el disco salta mucho.Otro defecto es el volumen del radio, si les gusta que su carro suene bien y duro no compren este radio que de eso tiene muy poco.Podria seguir diciendo cosas, pero al final quien a tenido un Pionner sabe lo que tuvo por lo cual estoy esperando que aparezca alguien para poder vender el Dual e ir a la tienda por el Pionner, bien vale el dicho ""mejor viejo conocido que nuevo por concer""."
2,You get what u pay for :-(,"I was looking for an inexpensive player and came across this one. The reviews looked promising and so i took the bate. Firstly the display is too bright, they should be a way to dim this. This can be very distracting when driving at night. 2 out of every 3 Cds i put in would give me the infamous ""error-01"". This is very frustrating. My compilations of mp3's would not play. Again that freaking ""error-01"". To get decent level of sound out of this unit would require an amplifier......... again...""error-01"""
3,did not get my complete oder,my oder was not completed for that dual XDM6820 AM MISSING THE MOUNTING SLEEVE i tried to contact the manifactor but it was useless it did not get no comferm reply
2,Plays CDs - but is Poorly Designed,"Yes, this CD player does everything it claims: it plays CDs, AM, FM, WMA, MP3, etc...However, the display is very hard to read and is incredibly bright at night. This is not a small annoyance by any means. It really distracts when driving and is really quite ridiculous. I would avoid this CD player again if I had the chance based on this seemingly small (but immensity annoying and unsafe) flaw."
1,It didn't work.,"I put this on my Wish List and someone bought it for me. Neither of us realized it would be junk. The disc player did not work right and I didn't realize it until after I left the car audio shop. The shop owner said he's seen more Dual units go bad than any other brand. Rather than wait around for another possibly bad unit, I bought a different brand that did work, for twice the price; fortunately he took pity on me and didn't charge me for two different installations. AVOID."
3,Beware of return policy,"I bought this car audio system for my husband for Christmas. My purchase of this product was based on the overall postive reviews this item received. Please be aware that this item has a VERY limited time in which it may be returned. I ordered it in advance because it was a Christmas gift. The return time limit had already expired even before it was unwrapped on Christmas day!! If he doesn't like it, I guess we're stuck with it."
2,AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this deck because I had had TWO previous ones stolen and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that just might be stolen. At first it was great! Great sound for me, it looked cool, and it played CDs. A lot of people have said the display lights are too bright, but they don't really bother me. After I had the unit for about 4 months I started having problems. First the screen would turn itself off even though all the other display lights remained on. Then the volume started to turn itself up randomly. I could deal with those two problems, but then the unit did something very strange. One day I went and moved my car without the faceplate on. The unit still played the CD I had in it without the faceplate!!!! None of these are really big problems but they are very annoying and I am considering buying a new brand name unit."
4,"Good price, decent quality, too bright LEDs","I liked the unit. it is very well built, materials and workmanship are close to perfect, sound quality is also very good. at least more than enough for a car.Mp3 player is quite fast - it takes 2-3 seconds to recognize the disk.""Random play"" is not really random - the sequence is always the same and very predictable.Controls are convinient, radio reception is also very good.The only issue which is VERY annoing - blue leds highhlighing push-buttons are EXTREMELY bright. there is no way to dim them or swith off. it's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on. I had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light:)"
4,Harsh reviews,"I was really torn over whether to buy this after reading some of the reviews here. I eventually did buy it and I am quite happy with it.- Yes, it is bright, but it doesn't bother me or my wife near as much as it bothers others here.-Yes, the buttons are small. I don't wear mittens in the car, so...- I think the sound is pretty good; it is certainly better than the stock stereo that came with my Toyota. Then again, I am NOT an audiophile, but I do have a bit of a palate. The whole reason I bought this is because all the other options for using my iPod with the existing stereo sounded horrible. This one sounds great. So, does it ""lack bass"" and is it ""hollow"" sounding? Not to my ears, but maybe I haven't heard some of the absolute top end decks.THE BAD- The one thing I've noticed that has been written about here is FM radio reception. My radio reception dropped considerably when compared to the stock unit I had before. I really don't use FM radio much, but some people might."
4,good but not great,it is a good cd player works great and sounds good the only downfall of tis produsct it not being able to dim the light on the keys durin noghttime driving it can be annoying and destracting with the keys bein so bright other than that it was a great cd player for the price that was paid
2,Disappointing,"After thirteen months, my display died. Also, the lights on this face plate are wayyy too bright. I've had to cover the blue buttons with electrical tape because they're too bright and there's no way to dim them."
3,Brighter than the sun !,"Did I mention this thing is bright? I mean it emits this blue light like I've never seen. Thought it was kinda cool until night time then look out. I drive a lot at night and this thing is very distracting. No way to dim it either. Also, of note the control layout is poor as are some of the display properties such as no clock unless you press a button. If you don't already have a clock this becomes a pain real fast. Also, the buttons are small and hard to read especially at night (blinding bright). The pluses are the price and the aux input for things like XM and Ipods. Honestly I wish I'd spent about $50 more to get another unit from a more established brand such as Pioneer or Sony. YMMV -- good luck."
1,DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE,"I bought 2 of these radios from "" the deep discount"" and both were defective beyond repair. Unfortunately for me since I did not have the radios tested before the return window expired, I got stuck with this junk. BEWARE WHEN BUYING FROM THIS RETAILER, they seem to be selling ""factory rejects""."
5,great buy,"This was a great buy for me, i replaced the stereo in an old dodge truck with this, and there is no comparison. It even made the old crappy speakers sound alot better (i still replaced them with good ones though). Wired it in, turned it on, worked like a charm. blue lighting is cool, though there is no wire for the dash lights dimmer. the plug in wires for the Iplug are the same as normal a/v cables, so you dont have to use the cable provided. I own a cable with the same plug ins that have the male end built into it, and it works great. no problems, sounds great, i dont even need an amp with my system, would recomend to friends."
3,Worked fine until its death at age 4 yrs.,"I had this player installed at Best Buy in 2005. It worked fine for 4 years, then caught on fire and died. The electrical fire appears to have sparked inside the actual box. It burned itself out in about a minute. It worked fine up until its death. I mostly used it with my iPod, transmitting the signal to its radio. I have no idea how to directly connect an iPod to the box as it suggests. I was never able to do that. I believe you need additional equipment (other than the stereo and iPod) to do that. The stereo would sometimes have trouble functioning in extreme temperatures (both hot and cold)."
2,Works okay,"Cons: The light on my stereo stopped working so I can't see track numbers, radio stations or the time. The ipod connection is outside the unit so its kind of bulky (I had one before from best buy that had the connection on the face plate). This last one may be the people who installed the player but the radio stations rarely come in, usually it's static fortunately I use the mp3 player and ipod connection most.Pros: it's fairly cheap and works decently"
2,you get what you pay for,"This was a serviceable unit and I had no complaints until the CD player died after about a year and half of use. It won't play any CDs, not even store bought ones. I won't be buying another Dual to replace it."
3,"Good player, but wma-compatibility is deceptive","I would have given (and loved to give) it a 5-star rating, if not for the fact that the machine doesn't play wma-formated music with any consistency, as it is supposed to in its product description. I called the company, and the person on the other end just said, straightforwardly, that the machine doesn't work with wma-format, and they have no fix and have no plan to fix it. I wish they had said that in their product description as straightforwardly. I am amazed that all the other reviewers just missed this glaring mis-description; or is it just me? Otherwise, this is a very good machine for playing mp3-formated everything, and I concur with all the other glowing reviews. Incidentally, the blue lights from the buttons are not that bad at all."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I agree with others comments on the display graphics; bright and gaudy. However the display items you may need to read, eq settings for example, are tiny and dim. But what I really want to speak on is the sound.Very poor detail, thin highs and poorly defined lows were immediately noticed by my wife. She asked if she can have my cassette adapter instead because is sounds clearly better than the aux in on this unit. The iPlug is just a mini to RCA adapter; use your own and get rid of one connection.That was the bad news...the good is the price. I payed less than $70 for mine and it is worth at least half that (to me). I feel the AudioVox FM modulator is a better buy."
2,Great features but hollow sound,"This receiver has every feature I wanted including MP3/WMA CD, and the iPlug Aux Input. They all work great. But the sound output is a big disappointment to me. I thought it might be the MP3/WMA file compression, but the radio suffers from the same problem. When they tuned this 200W amplifier with EQ settings, what kind of music were they listening to - trumpet solos ? There is no mid-range to provide ""fullness"". Its all high and low. The EQ settings are of no value, and the Loudness button is a MUST - without it the tinny sound is laughable. When the volume is low, there is not enough Bass & mid-range. When you turn it up the highs and the bass pound your speakers, and your ears, but still no mid-range.Function-wise it is a great deal and many people may think it sounds ""fine"". But Bottm line - if you really want Hi Fidelity, full-range rich sound, you might want to pass on this one."
3,"MP3 Deck for the price of a regular CD player, lacks bass though","It's a good deck for the price. I don't want to spend too much in case it gets stolen, that's one reason why I wanted a cheaper head unit.It plays MP3, which is something I really wanted in a deck. It doesn't play them in the order you put them on the CD, it goes buy the date they were originally burned, so whatever mp3 file/folder has the oldest date will play first.It lacks bass, that's it's biggest weakness.Yes it is bright, but I don't care too much about that.For the price it's good. If it had a little more bass I might give it a 4 or a 5.In this price range, this is the best deck you can get."
2,catalina caper,Big fan of MST3000 but there is just not enough in this movie to crack the jokes about. Also for some reason the volume is set to low in as far as the movie itself goe's. You will do much better with another MST3000...but not the Shakephere one !
3,"Fun, But Not Their Best","The plot in this 60's beach flick was generally unidentifiable. It had something to do with stolen artwork that is to be handed off at Catalina Island. The video sleeve depicted a skin-diving scene, but that was just given a brief lick in the film. Mostly visual of a lot of bikini girls and helmet hair guys ""having fun"". Kind of dorky. The music was kind of cool in a 60ish sort of way, with a neat cameo by Little Richard singing ""Scuba Party"". I don't see myself buying the soundtrack to this flick but the music was entertaining (sometimes), including Tom Servo's solo of ""Creepy Girl"". I agree with a fellow reviewer that Joel and the 'bots talked over the music too much, and probably ad-libbed a little too much . . . some of it just didn't come off. A 60's dork-fest, given a little help by MST3K."
5,"""They really sent the wrong guys to Vietnam...""","I think this was one of the funniest MST3K episodes I've ever seen. First of all, it's one of those all-white beach movies from the 60s, as can be seen when the gang link the crowd scenes to various far-right organizations (""This must be the 'Keep-Mandela-In-Jail' Dance""). Second, it's got Tommy Kirk (that's really all I need to say), not to mention the ""effeminate father"", ""creepy girl"", the ""stinky guy,"" and ""the guy who played Exxidor on 'Mork and Mindy'."" Joel and the bots were at their peak here, the Alan Sues reference during the Little Richard atrocity being a particularly fine moment. ""Thank you, Tommy Kirk, for making us laugh about love...again..."""
4,Not MST at it's best but still wonderful!,One of the only times that the Satellite of Love ever tackled a film that's supposed to be funny (but isn't at all). Some great riffs off the film and worth buying just for Tom Servo's Creepy Girl song (an MST3000 fan must see). Lots of fun but not quite as good as their absolute best. Still I would definitely recommend this for any fan of this show!
3,Not the greatest,"This is a movie without any semblance of a plot. Movie basically consisted of countless episodes of booty shaking. The guys riffs in this episode weren't top notch. This is a very early episode of the show, so they may still have been a little green. Recommended for hard core fans only."
5,La Oreja con Amaia,"Este dvd nos muestra los primeros videos de los primeros dos discos de La Oreja De Van Gogh en sus comienzos: Dile al Sol y El viaje de copperpot. Videos como: Cuentame al oído, primer single de la oreja, Pesadilla, Mariposa, Pop, La playa son parte de este dvd entre otros. Para los fans de la primera oreja este dvd es indispensable ya que, tiene extras de fotos, conciertos, etc. Cabe señalar que en estos discos la vocalista es la cantante Amaia Montero que cantó con la Oreja hasta el 2007. Actualmente la vocalista es Leire Martínez. Si te gustaba la participación de Amaia en la Oreja es un DVD que debes tener en tu colección."
4,LOVG DVD,Es un buen video para conocer la trayectoria de la banda. Puedes ver a los integrantes desde que comenzaron. Tambien contiene mucha informacion sobre la biografia de los mismos. El audio esta en Dolby 5.1 y se escucha muy bien.
4,does what its supose to do (I thought it was smoke frosted) ITS CLEAR!,"COmes clear for painting.i ment to buy the smoke colored one so i would not have to paint itWhen Painted on the Inside only leaves the clear plastic to prevent paint chipping.i had mine painted for $75.00 but insted of paying i traded some roofing materials for the paint joblooking at it now its way nicer then the smoke colored one when painted to match,"
2,Short Life,I only used this gauge two or three times on pressures of around 50 pounds. Now it is stuck on 20 pounds instead of zero.Now when I use it does it read the proper pressure or is it 20 pounds too high?? Very disappointed.
4,It works as designed,"What more can I say. It is functional, works as designed and is inexpensive. I only gave it four stars because the washer that comes with it is either too thin or too hard and leaked. I replaced it with a regular hose washer and problem solved."
4,Accurate and Inexpensive,"When checked against two known water pressures (99 and 41 psi), the gauge was accurate within +/- 2 psi after repeated testing. The gauge did show some condensation on the dial face. After it dried, I sealed the gauge with silicone. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5."
5,water pressure gage,I was very pleased with my purchase. It works just like it was described. I recomend this product to any one who is in need of it.
2,Not Good Quality,I'm a Home Inspector and the 3rd hose bib I checked with this froze at 70psi. I guess you get what you pay for...
4,Works Great,I had read reviews about the pressure meter leaking at the base so I sealed it up prior to using it but it worked great. No water leaked into the gauge any of the times I have used it.
3,water preesure tester,"What can I say, it tests water pressure @ your faucet outlets,hose faucets. It works as it should. Makes it easy to adjust your home water pressure regulator."
5,pressure gauge that works,"This pressure gauge was almost half the price the one from home depot, but so much nicer - solid construction and does not leak. Seems to be accurate too."
5,great buy,I purchased this item to test my water pressure and it did it's job without a hitch...I recommend this item to anyone.
1,cheap junk,Hooked this thing up to my faucet and got a reading of 140psi? With 60psi pvc pipes and a pressure regulator with a 75psi max? I'd have water up to my neck! Well you get what you pay for.
5,Household water pressure gauge.,"If you need something to simply check your household water pressure with, this is what you want. Our water pressure is eighty pounds. Yes, this is worth the price if simply for the information it gives you regarding your household water pressure. Lightweight and inexpensive. If you have Amazon Prime, then two day delivery is included. If you look real hard, you might be able to find this item for a buck or two cheaper but by buying on Amazon, you save a gallon of gas which is now half the price of this item; not to mention the hassles of traffic, finding one in a hardware store, getting through the checkout line and having to drive back home again, all to save a buck."
1,RECEIVED USED GAUGE!,"Received a gauge that was dirty, had water behind the plastic lens and a torn up box; obviously it was heavily used and then returned. Given that, I'm not convinced it's even accurate at this point. Not worth returning as it was so cheap and I could only get a replacement (no refund). Wasted my money so save yours and look elsewhere for a decent water pressure gauge."
4,Handy,"I purchased this to aid in adjusting the pressure regulating valve on my incoming city water supply, which is very high.I do not use the Rainbird Water Pressure Gauge often, but when you need one, this is a good one to have at a very reasonble price."
5,works great,"i do irrigation work and bought this for the occasional use. mainly to prove customers wrong about the water pressure they have on their house because it's NEVERRRRRR their fault something is wrong. or god for bid they have low water pressure. there was 1 instance where water droplets appeared on the under side of the glass. not much at all and didn't affect the use of it. the other times i've used it, it's worked fine. i would recommend it."
5,Works perfectly,"I'm not sure just what you can do with it other than satisfy your curiosity, but it works very well. If - for some reason - you simply want to know what kind of pressure you have at your house, this gauge works great!"
5,Works great with improved ease of reading the dial,"This Rain Bird pressure gauge replaces a four year old unit that I had. The old one was destroyed by curious children and a hammer. This unit allows you to tighten the gauge to the faucet with the ability to keep the dial in view. My older unit dial rotated as you tightened and many times pointing down or away from me making it difficult to see the pressure. The unit is very precise, easy to use and very responsive. The pictured product is a little different than what you receive. The actual product is much nicer with a display that shows psi and kg/cm2. It also has the Rain Bird logo on it - Made in China :)"
2,I can know read my water pressure.,"This is a very useful gaget. It now allow me to check the pressure of the water coming to me home. I have been fighting with my town on water pressure, now i have the prove."
3,Small,Order one size bigger than what you expect to need. I ordered these for my Daughter she had 3 other pairs (from different places) all the same size. When these arived they were a bit small even though they were the same size as the other pairs she has.. But other than that they are of nice quality.
1,Please do not buy,"This bike is a complete waste of money. I am a general contractor, very good with my hands, and this bike has many elements that are out of spec. The pedals would not thread onto the arms. The guard for the chain is plastic and is all kinds of warped. The paint finish is pretty awful. The directions may as well have been written in some dead language, totally useless. We bought it from Costco and they took it back no questions asked. Went and got a real bike made of metal and pre-assembled locally here in Austin. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
5,Great for girls,"My six year old loves this bike. She didn't need the training wheels but it is nice that it comes with them. It was easy to put together, my fourteen year old did it for her. She loves the little accessories that come with it and that it is Disney Princess. I had my first Huffy at age six and it is definitely a quality bike."
3,Terrible Assembly Directions,"Mostly I just want to say how terrible the assembly directions for this bike are.I went through the manual probably 10 times looking for the brake assembly and finally found it not actually in the manual, but on a separate loose page.The brake assembly was extremely difficult and following the directions was extremely useless. I finally had to go online for help and discovered that you actually need to loosen the cable from the wheel to get enough slack to have any hope of getting it to reach the handbrake itself. Once I figured this out, there was a lot of work involved getting it to the right tension so that the brake would grip easily, but not drag on the tires.Really frustrating assembly experience, but my daughter does love the bike."
4,Perfect Gift,The bike was a gift for my 2 year old daughter. She's been peddling for 6 months now and she has been begging for a bike like this. She is so happy to be riding. Fairly easy to put together. The only complaint I have is the box it was delivered in was pink and purple and it told anyone who saw it what it was. I found it on my porch I'm sure hours after it was delivered. And this was a from Santa gift. It took a lot of effort to get it into the house and in hiding without either of my kids finding out. Other than the packaging Great Buy!
1,Don't waste your money!,This bike is terrible! Do not waste your money! We tried for over two hours to put it together!
3,Not the suprise I had imagined...,"I wish I had realized that this bike would be delivered in a ""retail"" package, rather than an a brown unmarked box. The delivery guy brought up the brightly colored box (he didn't know it was a suprise), and my little girl saw it through the window. This was meant to be a suprise for her 4th bday...now I can only hope that she forgets about it in the next 2 weeks...but I doubt it. I have not began to assemble the bike...I may follow up with that review later."
1,Worse Purchase EVER!,"I bought this bike for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. Yes it is very cute, but everything falls apart. First off, when we took it out of the box you could see where the welding was very poorly done, and it was scuffed, and scratched in different parts. The hand brake has never worked, the pedal falls off almost every time its used, and the training wheels barely stay on. I have never seen a bike built so badly! Not only is it built bad, but it is very dangerous considering nothing stays put together. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
3,Pretty but not good,"It's very pretty and my daughter really loved it. However, we ended up returning it after one day. The pedal fell off continuously. The manufacturer didn't make the pedal insert area properly. Instead of spinning, the pedal would unwind itself and fall off. It was annoying at first then became dangerous as the pedal fell off in the middle of riding on the road. The floor model was doing this when we were trying it out at the store. We assumed it was due to over-use from the potential customers. It turns out that the bike parts are all made improperly."
2,candy-like aroma,"I was dissapointed by this candle, the wax is high quality but no way is it worth $25. I had to try it to see what all the fuss is about. Does not smell natural, smells like Pez or some other artifical fruit candy. Would not buy again, you can get high-quality soy candles for $15-$20 with a better aroma"
1,Very Dissatisfied,"This product is supposed to be an adult size and wouldn't fit over my thin petite friend with all my might to save her life. By the time we gave up she had a rubber burn on her leg. It's going to cost me more to ship it back for a refund so I'm batting zero. Seriously, just keep a belt handy in case of an emergency. That's what I'm planning to do. This page should have given exact length of product. I was having a little too much faith. My bad."
1,Broke the first time I used it...,"I literally opened the package, tried to see if it could actually fit around my thigh (It could not), and then tried it on my calf (could not fit either). I gave it a slight stretch around my calf as I assume a tourniquet should be at least a little tight and the cheap thing immediately snapped! What a piece of garbage!"
3,Doesn't live up to potential,"Unfortunately, this movie doesn't live up to the enormous potential that it is. The story is an intriguing one, and the cast is filled with underrated actors. There are many things never explained. While that is sometimes good to leave the audience guessing, I was left with the impression that it was mainly due to slopping directing.A lot of the imagery is cool however, and the story does keep the viewer interested. In the end, it isnt a bad movie, and if you are in the mood for a kinda creepy B-movie with awesome effects, then this DVD should suffice.Also in the ""Creature Feature"" series are two very well done movies called Earth Vs. The Spider and She-Creature. I definetly recommend those"
3,It's a pretty good movie!,"I was totally surprised when I bought this dvd very cheaply. Boredom one night forced me to watch it and it was most uniques. The special effects were decent. The story line was good, and kept me guessing at least 1/2 the way thru, and one small mystery til the very end!The actors all did a very good job. I think its a great movie for the little price, a little gore. No nudity but there is one sex scene. Very little swearing too. I enjoyed it. I think you will too."
2,"This one's ok, but put your time & money towards a better movie","This one's ok, but put your time & money towards a better movie.If you don't mind a B-grade movie with unspectacular effects, and a scary creature that isn't really scary, then you may enjoy this one.The acting is good, but the storyline is pretty ordinary.Nothing great here - but ok to pass the time."
2,Too much swearing and blaspheming,"The actors were very good. Randy Quaid did excellent performance and so did Nastassja Kinski. She really played a convincing role. However, I did not care for the vulgar sex act and the swearing and usage of blaspheme. Is not a movie to watch in mix company. I am sorry I purchased it. I wish I known ahead of time about the language and the sex I would have passed on it."
2,Bun A fire Pon Burrel,"Sizzla, please, please, please ,please tighten up noh! I almost return this one! Who compose/choose di tune dem star?Haffi hold onto it sameway.Blessed Love."
2,Wah?!?!?,"Sizzla, please, please, please ,please tighten up noh! I almost return this one! Who compose/choose di tune dem star?Haffi hold onto it sameway.Blessed Love."
3,Rastafari Teach I Everything,"It is always a joy to hear timely new words and beats from the Bobo, but i was disappointed after listening to this album in a local record store here in Orlando. I agree with Music Fan from Zion's review and selection of albums to purchase. I got the Taking Over album the said day, and also have Black History, love them both! Staunch Sizzla fans will love the 'RED' Bobo that prevails throughout the 'Taking Over' album!"
2,Nothing impressive here,"Sizzla always come out with three albums a year: A Greensleeves, VP, and a Jet Star release, so this 3rd release comes as no surpries. This release is the worst of the three this year. Whoever made the beats for these songs did an injustice to Sizzla. Just listen to the the sound clips for yourself. I heard the sound clips on CDNow.com (much better sound quality) and was not impressed at all having already bought Taking Over and Black History. This release is a sad attempt at crossing-over on the part of Greensleeves records. The ""hip-hop/r&b"" (or whatever they are) beats are weak!! I'm a big fan of Kalongi's music and I have every single album (from Burning Up to Taking Over) but this is one I prefer to leave with the distributor. If you're looking for new Sizzla music, do yourself a favor and get Taking Over or Black History instead."
5,Great low impact for those just starting out!!,"I started actively exercising a little over a year ago. I joined Weight Watchers and did Gilad's Bodies in Motion on TV for about 7 months. I got pg. in July and got out of the habit of exercising. I started again with a low impact pg. workout, but got bored with that. Being that I live in PA and it is usually cold and icy in the winter, I was looking for something to change up my workouts. I bought this video and I must say that it is pretty easy!! I did the 1 mile and have yet to do the 2 mile (maybe next week). It is low impact enough and didn't get my heartrate too much above normal that it is great for those last few months of pregnancy."
5,MY SECOND FAVORITE EXCERCISE TAPE OF LESLIE'S,I'M 51 YEARS OLD AND CAN NOT YET GET UP TO SPEED OF KATHY SMITH. (ALTHOUGH I HOPE ONE DAY I'LL BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE EXERCISE TAPES.) I BOUGHT THIS TAPE FIRST EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN AND LOVED IT! MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IS EASY STRETCH WITH GREG SMITHEY TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE!!! THEN? LESLIE SANSONE'S WALK & FIRM FOR OLDER ADULTS. THEN? THIS ONE!!!
5,Millionaire Marine Strikes Gold!,"Cathie Linz owns the Marine Corp! Her trademark humor has never been on better display than in Her Millionaire Marine. There are also some lovely, touching moments readers will enjoy. A terrific way to celebrate Spring!Susan Elizabeth Phillips"
5,what the * are you talking about if you want feeback say so,they are nice. they are just what I expected. did you want more then that?this is not high school I`m not going to rite an essay
3,Just use a regular fingernail clipper,There is nothing special about the fishing line clipper. It's just a big clipper like one uses on fingernails. It is not necessary to have this because there are no other tools included on it. The only thing you can do with it is clip line. I was disappointed.
3,"Great taste, way too expensive","I absolute LOVE this jelly, but it has gotten way over-priced. When I first started buying it, it was about $5.95 for an 8-oz jar. I was dismayed to open my recent shipment, which cost almost $10, and discover that the jar contained only 5 ounces, which is barely larger than a sample! It has a wonderful flavor, but I cannot rationalize spending that much money on jelly. Very disappointed."
3,Cheri's Prickly Pear Cactus Jelly - 8 0z,"Either I am reading some thing wrong or the previous review claiming the price went up on this product is an understatement. At $6.25 for an 8 oz. jar and $7.78 for shipping, this is a product costing over $14. This brings the per ounce cost to $1.75 an ounce. This seems a bit excessive when you can buy Lump fish Caviar for only $1.92 and ounce if you have Prime shipping. Just saying. Guess my guests won't be tasting this next weekend."
5,works well,"I am using this for a small extension to my hammock to be able to reach the other anchor. Works well, my only problem is that it makes noise when you move around, so I wrapped it up with cloth to fix that."
4,Great choice for a wedding music collection,"I'm a sound technician, and I have used this CD at many weddings over the last few years. I've had nothing but positive comments from the wedding party and from guests regarding the music on this CD. It's also bailed a handful of couples out when the rehearsal arrives and they realize they've forgotten to hire musicians! In no way does a CD replacing actual pianists and organists detract from the ceremony(some people contend that canned music ""cheapens"" the ceremony). All in all, it's a great choice."
1,this really is bad,"I do not recommend this to anyone, it was very crappy and I would rather have no music at my ceremony than to play any of these."
4,Does the job,"There aren't too many metric feeler gauges out there and this set is pretty good for the money. My only complaint is you have to combine leaves to get some thicknesses. To get .018mm you have to combine .010mm and .008mm. Not a huge problem but can cause a slight inaccuracy if you're not careful. If you need a metric feeler gauge set and don't want to get an English set and do the conversion, then get this one."
3,"Concept good, track list not so good","If you want a definitive Steely Dan collection, get the Citizen Steely Dan Boxed Set and buy Two Against Nature & Everything Must Go as separate CDs."
5,Steely Dan,DVD was indicative if the music and the sheenanikans of that era but I had to return it without fully appreciating it's worth due to the DVD arriving too late for the purpose it was purchased for. No problems with a refund which arrived back as soon as goods were received. Good ole Amazon - so true to their word.
3,"I agree, but I disagree, but I agree...","I agree that yet another Steely Dan hits disc seems excessive, but not if one is after a better mastering job than the older cds provided. However,I disagree that this is a better remaster. It is a subjective, relative matter, but I prefer the ""Decade of Steely Dan"" original disc to this one.I do agree that the earlier remasters were a bit lean sounding, lacking some natural richness, especially in the midrange. But this one is excessively warm with rolled-off treble. If you have a treble biased solid state amp, this might do it for you, but I have a system with pretty good resolution and overall neutrality, and this disk is worse than the originals, but in the other direction!I just picked up all of their records in used vinyl, at really decent prices, and the sound is better than either of the discs mentioned, or any other cd I have heard from Steely Dan. I don't have a great turntable or anything, its just that the source is so much better with the LPs."
4,Steely Dan - collection,"Great CD! Has all of the hits! Just what I was looking for, all in one package. Dont have to buy multiple CDs."
5,Replacing what girlfriend took,"The Definitive Collection from Steeley Dan is a great CD which, in my case, replaces the one my former girlfriend failed to return."
4,"Sadly, Not As Definitive As It Should Be","A lot of great Steely Dan music but this ""Definitive Collection"" is notvery definitive when it's missing a great song like Pretzel Logic."
4,Awesome CD-but scratched,"How can you go wrong w/ Steely Dan? It's an awesome collection. However 3 of the tracks were scratched upon arrival. Which stinks. I hope when I send it back, it goes smoothly."
2,"How can this be considerd ""The Definitive Collection ""","HOW can this be considered ""The Definitive Collection"" and it does'nt even include BLACK COW? IMO that was one of his big hits. This is NOT a ""Definitive Collection"" Not even close to being Definitive..decent yes DEFINITIVE no."
2,"FM, Indeed","Steely Dan has been chronicled in a number of greatest hits releases and this 2006 collection does nothing to replace the previous ones or provide new insight.This is a good starting part for those beginning to explore the band's catalog and do not want to immediately jump into the studio albums. And for those who are lodged into listening to a FM Classic Rock format, the collection presents the songs that have some rotation when Steely Dan's number is ""drawn"" for airplay.But repackaging the same selections time and again is not definitive and makes it impossible to recommend for fans who have progressed well past this point in their record libraries."
4,WHAT'S COOKING? SAMPLE THE ENJOYMENT DISHED OUT HERE,"Some words that immediately popped into our mind when we devoured this collection of short stories that dishes out our obsession with foods: Tasty. Terrific. Totally fat-free. The 55 well-written, well-seasoned tales here, drawn from the pages of various magazines and best-selling books, as well as original works, take us from Fiji to France, the Amazon.comto the Big Apple. Jeffrey Tayler encounters the pain of post-Soviet Russia in a humble sausage. Robert Strauss nibbles on a potato chip and experiences an exercise in Zen meditation. Jonathan Raban goes nuts s he discovers people eat squirrels in Wisconsin. David Lansing's cheese-smuggling confessional. Betcha you can't read just one!"
3,Not as strong as previous Salamat releases,"There are few music projects as interesting to follow as Salamat. Each release features a different combination of Egyptian and Nubian singers and musicians.I happened to like two of the four singers featured on this release, so it's only partly enjoyable. As usual, however, the CD features great artwork."
3,Above average,"The formula for the current career management books is: (1) start with self assessment (accomplishments, skills, values, strengths); (2) analysis of where you fit best -- what tyep of profession, organization, etc.; and (3) how to manage career challenges.As this formula goes, ""What Next"" does a decent job. It is populated with a variety of assessment tools, it covers the basics, such as resume writing, cover letter writing, interviewing, negotions.What holds the book back, in my opinion, is that it does not provide anything more than the basics -- surely, it's nicely illustrated and well written, but so are many other books in the field. If you are looking for a concise, to the point and practical guide, I recommend WetFeet ""Job Hunting A to Z""."
4,Simple and decent,"When I was looking for a pair of powered portable speakers, I looked at this pair from Sony, as well as a couple selections at Radio Shack, all for the same price of $19.99. Compared to the Radio Shack speakers, the Sony has these pros and cons:Pros:- lightweight- better build quality (all are made in China)- accommodates easier-to-find AA batteries vs. size C for RS- slightly better sound with more clarityCons:- no bass or treble controls as on the RS speakers- not as loud as the RS speakers, but the latter gets distorted so bad so the maximum volume is meaninglessIn the end I chose the Sony speakers for better sound and build quality as well as a longer warranty. I use them with my RCA Lyra MP3 Jukebox and also my Panasonic SL-SV550 CD/MP3/Radio player. Pretty happy so far."
2,Don't expect much.,"These speakers on definitely on the low end of sound quality. At a power rating of 1 watt per speaker, they sound much smaller than they look. The sound is a harsh mix of the mid-to-high-end range. There is no hint of bass.Battery life (four AA batteries) will give you between 15-30 hours of play. While this isn't bad, it also means that if you accidentally leave the power switch on, you'll be on your way to the store for more batteries. Good thing there is an AC plug (but no cables).On the lighter side, the packaging mine came with said that these could be used with a Walkman, CD Walkman, MD Walkman, or PC. It then stated that ""Walkman and PC is not supplied."" Rats, I thought I was going to get a PC for twenty bucks!"
3,You get what you pay for,"For under $20 these speakers do their job. They get loud, and that's probably their best quality. They are pretty clear, but there is no bass. You are definitely getting what you pay for.The speakers are not supplied w/ an A/C adapter and I had trouble finding an after market one to power them properly."
1,Stop the buzzing!,"These speakers have been trying my patience from the start. Direct mode (no power source) is useless unless the speakers are next to your head. The moment I added a power source (either with batteries or the Sony AC-E90HG adapter), the buzzing noise was present and would not stop. It seemed to be related to the non-removeable stereo cable. The buzzing was problematic enough to send these speakers packing after only a day."
3,O.K.!!!!!!!,"These speakers are ok, they do not go up that loud and they do not sound that great!!! I would not get them i would spent a little bit more money and get something better. But they are great if you are listening to them at a low volume."
1,AC adapter not included???,"...and that's how they get you. The Sony brand adapter is listed at $39. You can buy an universal adapter for under $20(the sony is rated at 9v and 800mA), but there is a catch. The universal adapter's plug is too long! It won't make the proper contact with these speakers. But there is a way to make them work. Find the right adapter plug and put a little piece of tinfoil in the hole of the adapter---don't put it in the speaker hole.So, Sony uses a shorter adapter so you think you can't use the universal adapter and charges you $39 for their adapter.You could try using a spring from a ballpoint pen or any small springs; or, cut a piece off a paper clip or copper wire, but the tinfoil is easy to use---just stuff enough into the whole to make contact. It can be scraped out if you need that plug for another device."
3,"Not good for music, but good enough for voice audio","Initially I bought these speakers because they looked really nice, were made by Sony and were cheap. I guess none of that made any sense when I initally used them for music. These speakers are just bad for music. However, I got a job as a teacher a few years back and I used these speakers for audio books and they worked great."
1,First sony product,These speakers are the first product that I have ordered from Sony that are absolutely terrible.1. No volumn without distorting2. No quality3. And no bassDo not buy.
2,Poor Sound Quality,"First of all, this speaker is for the office and not for music or entertainment. It has poor sound quality, and it sounds worse than the $10 dollar speakers I got from my brother. If you're going to be using these speakers for entertainment, do not buy these.If you are looking for entertainment speakers, buy the 2.1 or above. Don't buy one like these."
5,Sound from those speakers?,"I had a pair of Sony speakers that had no power source (no batteries or AC adaptor)...and they worked fine for what they were. however, I wanted something that could be low with no batteries, but if I wanted to hear them outside with people talking etc, I wanted to be able to power them up and actually hear the music from my IPOD as opposed to it being barely audible.I searched everywhere for something small, that worked with batteries, worked with AC adaptor, and also worked alone with no power. These were the only pair that I could find at the time and they perform excellently.Whenever I use them people are amazed at what kind of volume is able to be produced by these little things.They should definitely be a part of anybody's IPOD kit...highly recommended."
2,Shattered Expectations,"If you set your expectations low enough, you just might be satisfied. Sony SRS-A27 speakers aren't worth $14.99 let alone $19.99. With only 1w per Speaker, don't expect to much. I recommend you shop around unless you want to waste $19.99. Overall I give them 1 Star each for participation."
5,"Geoffrey Simmons, M.D..What Darwin Didn't Know","A superb book and well worth reading, no matter how one feels about the subject."
2,"Old theory, new flawed arguments","I don't want to add anything about Behe's reductionnist science since everything has already been said below, but I just want to ask a simple question: Why doesn't any religious reviewer grant God the intelligence to have created evolution. It seems to me that it would give God more positive attributes than simply creating a static world. If He is all powerful, he could have created evolution easily after all."
1,"Hogwash, pure and simple.","Behe's arguments are mental masturbation as he conveniently distorts concepts to argue that the lack of a Darwinian history is evidence that something was created by a designer (Zeus? Odin?). That wonderful whipping boy of ID, the bacterial flagellum, has indeed been show to be reducible. One of the ""motor"" proteins (Type Three Secretory System) is used by parasitic bacteria to inject material into host cells and has a function outside of being incorporated into flagella.Behe continues to provide evidence, that he relies on the supernatural any time he does not have the skill or imagination to understand biological science. I am tired of credulous charlatans who spout pseudoscience. Please do not trust arguments from authority as not all biologists, chemists and especially physicians, are trained sufficiently well in the principles of scientific inquiry."
1,I hope Behe is cashing on being a writer because he is a failure as a scientist,"When someone indites the 'Theory of Evolution' as a theory not a fact, it makes it sound as if theories and facts are opposite things, as if we are really sure of facts and not so sure of theories. In science theory is a higher level of understanding then facts, because what theories do is explain the facts by uniting them. Theory is a system of explanations that elucidate the observable facts of nature.This book is a failure of the human desire for scientific understanding: it's beenpeer reviewed and the response is unanimously negative. Don't waist your time with this waist of paper."
3,It's now discussed..,"Behe could bring the topic to scientific discussion as well as no one did. He could show some situations (irreducible complexity) that really intrigate Darwinism theory, but Behe appears not to shot a opinion. He believes in the ""intelligent design"" but he don't consider himself as a creationist. What it would be? The book has evoked the evolutionists to solve a controversial and a not sactisfatorily explained situation."
2,A Poor Book,"Behe's book is nonsense. If you read THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN, you'll understand evolution as its never been understood before."
4,A Stunning Challenge To Evolution,"Behe takes the kind of logical and reasoned approach that has often been missing from ""creationist"" arguments. In doing so he lays down a challenge to the theory of evolution that it has been so far unable to answer (a fact which he demonstrates by documenting extensive searches of applicable journals). The responses to this book cannot simply take the highly emotive path of implying that anyone who questions evolution is mentally deficient - this is the type of blind credulity widely associated with religion. Proponents of evolution need to present an equally detailed rebuttal demonstrating how the complex systems required for life, the component elements of which having no function or selective advantage to the organism by themselves, have come about by random chance."
1,I still believe Darwin,"The author of this book is so simple minded (and w/o imagination) that a simple physical system (the cell) has him looking to the sky. He disguises himself as a scientist and at the first sign of trouble (complexity) he bails out looking for a higher power. He has a good understanding of the biochemical processes that are in place, but fails to mention any research on more primitive organisms that could show us how our complex cells evolved. His argument about irreducibly complex is the biggest crap I ever read. Anything can be considered irreducibly complex in the context of what it does. Take the human body. You need a finger (among other things) to hold a chaulk. You finger is part of a irreducibly complex system when it comes to you picking up a chaulk. So does that mean all of a sudden that a higher power put the human body together? Give me a break. I think there's enough evidence in fosiles to prove otherwise. I don't recommend this book to any real scientfic mind."
3,"DARWIN'S BLACK BOX, an excellent argument for Creation","DARWIN'S BLACK BOX is an excellent argument for Creation. However, it is very technical, and difficult for non-scientists to follow."
2,Poor Science,"Behe shows his limited knowledge of modern evolutionary theory and totally forgets to speak of natural history, ecology, developmental biology and heterochrony.He argues that since we didn't find all the answers, we can't find them in the future, so the Creator must be responsible for all that we don't understand yet. A century ago no one believed that the continents move, but now everybody takes it for granted today. Next century, Behe's arguments (and Denton's too) will be shown to be ridicule.People without proper knowledge of the science involved should'nt take Behe's arguments for granted. They're is more to it than what is presented. See the new discovery about the origin of ARNt and the new hypothesis about the first eukaryotes (both in Nature magazine) as well as the results of experiments recreation in laboratory of deep-sea vents and the new findings of the metabolism that goes on in those sulfurous, hot waters. Life could very well have started ther (Earth magazine, jan. 98)."
2,"Flawed and deceptive - see my ""Behe's Empty Box"" page...","The ""3"" is for the appendix.I've dedicated an entire web page to exposing theserious flaws in this book. To sum it up:1) Evolution does produce ""Irreducibly complex"" systems2) There are published papers that attempt to flesh out the evolution of biochemical systems3) This is clearly a God-in-the-gaps argument4) Behe aligns himself with organizations that DO identify the designer - ""God"" - and he has become their new poster boy in the fight against ""material"" science.For much more see my ""Behe's Empty Box"":http://www.spacelab.net/~catalj/box/behe.htm"
4,A biochemist examines Darwin's theory of natural selection.,"Darwin's Black Box by Michael J. Behe examines naturalselection from a biochemist's viewpoint. Associate professor of Biochemistry at LehighUniversity, Behe questions the validity of Darwin's theory by looking at the cell and itsmechanism. He reveals the extreme complexity of cellular life and unfolds questionsthat beg answers without deferring to the creationist.From the Bacterial flagellum's complex propelling system to the deceptivelysimple clotting of blood, Behe shows that life is incredibly complex at the cellular level,and he reveals Darwin's misunderstanding of life's rudimentary elements."
2,disappointing,"For a detailed 'prebuttal' of this book's attempt to limit thescope of evolution, try: ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"",by Daniel Dennett"
1,Anti-science,"The reviewer of 15 sept. misrepresents the main tenet of ""intelligent design"". Behe admits in his ""response to critics"" of july 31, 2000 (on discovery.org), using his example of the bacterial flagellum, that ""intelligent design"" means that ""the flagellum can't be produced by natural selection acting on random mutation, or ANY OTHER unintelligent process"". In the same response, he then says ""I acknowledge that I cannot rule out the possibility future work might explain irreducibly complex biochemical systems without the need to invoke intelligent design"": Prof. Behe is already crawling back. Much ado about nothing, in other words."
5,Ignore the people who criticize this book,"This is an excellent book that brings to light excellent scientific reasons why darwinian evolution could not possibly be responsible for life as we know it. Keep in mind that the author believes in the theory of darwinian evolution, yet he makes such strong arguments against it being possible. Darwinists, take note. If your pet theory is to be ever scientifically proven, you'll need to be able to give answers to the questions raised by this book."
1,Facts Schmacts,I had to have this book for a Creation and Evolution class. I was really looking forward to hearing a scientifically based rebuttal to the Evolutionary Theory - I was sorely disappointed. Behe regularly misquotes statements and misrepresents data which doesn't do much to help his argument. What disappoints me even more are the number of people who will undoubtedly read this book without doing any research of their own to fact-check.
1,It actually deserves 0 stars...,"This book is filled with fallacies. It is a shame that Mr. Behe is abusing his title as a doctor and as a professor of biological sciences when so little in this book is actually scientific. Poorly researched, and incorrect quotes are throughout. A real embarassement to the American scientific community. Mr. Behe is doing our society a true disservice."
4,A worthwhile read for any REAL scientist,"This book provides an excellent account for the intricate complexities encountered in an orgransim as well as those found in individual cells. It provides sound examples of complex biochemical pathways that make a gradualistic explanation of their origination highly improbable. Dr. Behe provides an accurate and up-to-date understanding of these biological systems that was not available at the time of Darwin.As a dedicated, mainstream scientist who has conducted high quality research at two leading biomedical institutions, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is truly committed to authentic scientific exploration whether it be in the biological sciences or any other branch."
1,This is not science,"It's hard to believe that nobody took the time to really assess the pseudo-scientific arguments made by Behe. By just Googling around you would quickly discover that all Behe's argumements have been factually contradicted (the last time being in court for the Dover trial it seems).Just read the following, and see by yourself whether there are more than ad-hominem to the scientific argumentshttp://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html"
2,Alien Design,"My friend and I were looking at pictures of crop circles. He thinks its Aliens because he can think of no other explaination. I say ""I don't know how my Microwave works either, but I'm pretty darn sure it's not Aliens."" And so ID is a slippery slope of just how things you don't understand can come to exist. If you can't understand how life started and evolved over 4 billion years then how can thinking it all happened - just like that - in 6 days is a good scientific alternative? Maybe the answer for ID turns out to be something that kills the real premise - like Aliens. Two stars for sticking with it."
5,Keep an open mind.,"What I got out of Dr. Behe's book is that evolution is the obvious conclusion in some instances. In other instances, evolution does not seem to be a viable explaination. Now, he seems to jump to the intelligent design conclusion rather quickly. There are so many scientific questions that haven't been answered; humankind can only do so much in the 80 years since the electron microscope was invented. He never goes to the Bible or any religion as a resource, but relies on science journals and logic. I applaud the author's open-mindedness and hope that those who read this book can consider several options."
1,A reply to the prominent first review,"He assumes that a single insitution's study alone proves the mathematical impossibility of evolution because a brute random version of evolution would take impossibly wrong. This is a strawman argument.Some had compared the odds of life randomly assembling to some monkeys pounding on a few typewriters, hoping to somehow recreate the lingual, semantic, literary 'irreducible' complexity of ""Hamlet"". A researcher took them up on it: he used a program where only the fittest (most Hamlet-y) letters survived. It took only a few hours to produce a perfect copy.Evolution does not create whole, random objects. Copious incremental variations do the trick. It has been proven far better than a few erroneous calculations by a questionable institute fifty years ago."
4,"Good critique of natural selection, but...","As you can tell by the large number of reviews, Behe's book is very thought-provoking. I liked it best as a damaging critique of generally accepted ideas of evolution by natural selection. Behe points out that 100 years of biochemical research has raised questions that natural selection theory shows no signs of being able to answer. I personally don't agree with Behe's idea of Intelligent Design. At least, such a radical idea is only one hypothesis to answer the lingering questions about complex biochemical systems. Whether you like intelligent design or not, the burden now rests on neo-Darwinists to start explaining how natural selection can produce complex biochemical systems. And so far they HAVE NOT done this."
1,More gussied up creationism.,"Commits the usual creationist mistakes. Jumps to conclusions. Misrepresents the case for evolution. Makes unsupported absolutist statements. Looks for overly simple solutions to extremely technical and complex issues. Requires unsupportable belief in supernatural forces without explaining or providing proof of how they operate.""Irreducibly complexity"" and ""intelligent design"" are simply creationism gussied up with some technical sounding language to make it sound legitimate. This book is full of logical and technical flaws and is not being taken seriously by the scientific community at large.Look through the reviews here. Many point out major flaws of this book. There is a very good review by a J.M. Ridlon. And another person pointed out an excellent website, www.talkdesign.org that also makes clear this book's flaws."
1,disappointing due to serious omissions.,"This book makes the reader think it will contain some great revelation, but in the end i found it quite disappointing. The author ignores all the work that has been done to show that evolution can occur in a test tube at a molecular level. If you are going to attack the theory of natural selection, and the factual evidence of evolution, then really, biochemistry is precisely the worst place to try to do it, because the evidence in favor of the power of natural selection is simply so clear. But none of this is cited in the book, quite conveniently for the author. Perhaps most disappointing, the author ignores the obvious point that in many cases the current design of animals is NOT always optimal, suggesting that if they were designed, it was not done in an intelligent way. The ""theory"" presented here cannot pass its own test."
1,Does this bother you at all?,"Attorney: But you are clear, under your definition, the definition that sweeps in intelligent design, astrology is also a scientific theory, correct?Behe: Yes, that's correct.(October 18, 2005; Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District)"
2,"Old wine, new bottles","One would think that 80 years after the Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, that the Creationists would have given up. Their latest incarnation, proponents of Intelligent Design like the author of this book, are simply more devious. They could not prevent Darwin from being taught in the schools, so they want to present Intelligent Design as an alternative to Darwin.It is the purpose of science to explain how the world operates. The Theory of Intelligent Design explains nothing. It has nothing to do with science. It is thinly disguised religion, and has no place in a science class. If ID'ers want to teach their beliefs in parochial schools, fine. But beware, when their children transfer to college they are going to be laughing stocks."
2,the latest evolution of the creationist arguement,"Wow, a scientist well versed into the biomechanics of the cell has found new way to amaze us by creating a Creator in the confounding complexity of millions of years of evolution. I guess it goes to show that even the creationist arguement is not immune to the forces of evolution. Better than saying denying the existence of dinosaur bones or a spherical earth. It's an academic step up from the usual standard of creationist literature an average junior high student would laugh off. It all goes to show that the arguement for creationism will evolve like anything else. No, wait, God MUST HAVE BEEN the inventor of ink and paper and typesetting and binding because without those ""intelligent designs,"" I wouldn't have come across this in the first place! BTW I for one KNOW that a car is ""irreducably complex"" because all I can figure out about it is how to change the oil."
1,Too naive,"I am no Darwinist, but I think Behe is wrong too. He carefully examines minute details of the body, such as blood clotting. But noone can deny that you have to know the whole in order to know the part. Behe doesn't, nor does any scientist. Because we are part of truth you can't see truth, or be conscious of it. You have to be truth in order to know truth. Behe is just a scientist with all the dogmas of science. Science gives us a model of the world, but no model is true, because no model is the same as what it models. A photo of a man is no less the truth about that man than a biochemical analysis of bloodclotting is part of the truth of human beings.Gunnar Odhner, Swedish writer and philosopher"
2,Behe's Empty Box,"Sure Michael Behe is a scientist, but is intelligent design science? If so it will be the first field of science to be established without a single technical paper published for peer-review, and yes ZERO by Behe himself. Why bother when you can completely bypass scientific review and go directly to a Darwin-doubting public?I have created an extensive web resource related to this book, in case you want to know what scientists really think of the hypothesis for intelligent design - including Behe himself of course:"
2,But What Happened?,"This book falls into the broad category of criticism of evolution. Unfortunately, it fails because it does not offer a clear alternative. Behe tries to argue that things were 'designed' but then fails to say just what was designed and when (I can agree with Behe to skip 'who' for now). For example, he claims that the biochemical evidence on the mammalian clotting system was designed. When was it designed? In what animal? The paleontological evidence shows that mammals have been around for 150+ million years. Was the very first mammal imbued with a clotting system by the designer and then the rest of the mammals (humans included) evolved from that? Or is he proposing something else? Flagella have been around for most the beginning of life on earth; when did the designer do that? Before that, were there bacteria without flagella? Behe would do far better if he were to come out and say, even vaguely, what happened and when."
1,Behe is fake scientist and an intellectual light weight,"Let's be Perfectly clear, Behe is an interesting philosopher but not a scientist--in fact as a scientist he is a failure in his chosen profession.Behe is not known to the world because of recognition his work has received from the scientific community. None of his studies have shed any light into the underpinning of biochemistry or have advanced the field in any way.The only reason the world has heard of this Behe is because he has successfully used institutions such as the discovery institute and other fundamentalist organizations as a platform to distribute his propaganda.Scientist such as myself that have read his papers come to the same conclusion that his peers did at Lehigh University, who claim that:""It is our collective position that intelligent design has no basis in science, has not been tested experimentally and should not be regarded as scientific"""
1,foolish,"masking a political agenda with half truths and misplaced facts..............sadThe only people who will believe this tripe are the ones with no microbiology knowledge. I hope it gets put in the ""satire"" section of bookstores."
1,Good for creationists,"Just another brainless pseudo-cientist trying to prove the existence of a Creator based on the lack of a complete understanding of the Evolution's theory down to the biochemical level. If you appreciate real science and will not settle with any short cut explanation of life on earth, don't waist your money or your time with this book. One thing is for sure: The author enjoys a lot of metaphors. They account for nearly 75% of the book. Clearly writing for uneducated people, trying to sell his poor and lazy ideas."
1,Here's some logic for y'all...,"There go the creationists again. Ignoring the fossil record, our genes, etc. etc.Behe, however, is smarter than most. He can tell that the earth is old. He acknowledges that some things do evolve. Yet he claims that there's an irreducible complexity to life, and macroevolution just doesn't happen.Well, I've got a little exercise in logic for y'all:Long time + a series of small changes = BIG changes.You just can't deny that, no matter how hard you try. And yet Behe tries to. A hypocrite? Yes indeedy.Sorry dudes, if you accept micro, you get macro for free. And irreducible complexity? Please."
1,Moron posing as a chemist,"This ""book"" is absolute garbage. It doesn't even merit the single star in the rating category, and the only additional attention that it deserves is a quick toss into the recycling bin. Hopefully, the paper may be put to better use in the future."
3,"Neither ""right"" nor ""wrong"", but worth reading--in context.","I found this book interesting to read, not because Behe is ""right"" or ""wrong"", but because he provides enough interesting ideas to stimulate a fruitful discussion. He doesn't really prove his case for intelligent design, but neither does he simply shoot himself in the foot as so many Creationist writers and reviewers do. The ideas he presents in his book deserve a thoughtful critique, not a knee-jerk ""He's right!"" or ""He's wrong!"" response. A reviewer who points out specific holes in his material can be doing the author a great service, if the author's interest is in refining his hypotheses to make them more useful. I appreciate the efforts of those reviewers who have done this so far, and I hope their ongoing critique will continue in spite of the ravings of the True Believers who think he has proven their own pet theories for all time."
1,"Behe gets an ""F"" in Evolution 101","Behe's book is that same, tired irreducible complexity arguments, dressed up in scientific terminology to sound like it's cutting-edge. Behe demostrates a poor understanding of evolution: all complexity IS reducible. His examples of biomolecules working in perfect harmony, such that the absence of any one of them breaks the entire system, totally ignores the fact that these sets of molecules are the evolutionary products of earlier sets of molecules which did work independently. Behe is simply ignorant."
2,Not one of my favorites,"I ordinarily love reading this type of book, even if I don't agree with the author. However, I was very disappointed in this book and stopped reading it after 2-3 chapters.Dr. Behe's ""Biochemical Challenge to Evolution"" seems to be an inability to grasp that evolution can happen on a biochemical, as well as a macroscopic, level. For example, Dr. Behe attempts to refute Dr. Dawkins' scenario of how a a structure such as the eye could evolve. The argument boils down to ""...well maybe the *structure* did evolve, but the biochemistry couldn't possibly have!"".I must be missing something here..."
4,A new question on the subject,"What Behe has manage to achieve is a new question to the argument. The question is larger than Behe. It is in the public domain and as an alternative view anyone could apply it. Science works in the present and that is the state of play that the books deals with. His critics tend to avoid real scientific explanations, with real cells, choosing rather to concentrate on ad hominem attacks, just so stories and at best the speculative theory of cooption evolution, of which no one has observed it. The black is open and his critics hasn't closed it."
2,Underwhelmed,"While I wasn't convinced of his argments, Michael Behe does a credible job of presenting the position of Intelligent Design. He gets bogged down in explaining the science and gets a little condescending in his attempts to draw correlations for the ""layman"" reader."
1,Politics and science don't mix,"Behe has chosen a strange way to promote a scientific theory: appealing to public. This book (as apparently shown by the high rating it gets) indeed has high political appeal to certain circles of believers whose favorite scapegoat is evolution. But in the field of science it is a whopping failure, since most of his arguments have been readily demonstrated to be, so to speak, shortsighted. Many of the biochemical chains he claims to be ""irreducibly complex"" have been shown to be quite reducible; even his pet mousetrap analogy has been debunked - by demonstrating a mousetrap reduced to a single spring. Add his dishonest treatment of quotations - and it robs Behe of most credit.Of course, I guess the supporters would still believe in this book no matter what. However, if you want another look at the issue, ... ."
2,Behe's blank book,"Behe is a scientist who mixes science with religious faith. He identifies areas in the life sciences that we don't fully understand to make a fallacious case for ""intelligent design."" One can read Behe for an appreciation of the complexity of life (hence my two star rating), but there are better books without the religious agenda. I've always liked the expression ""Black Box."" Too bad Behe has given it such a strong religious association."
2,"Bad science, worse religion",I'll toss my hat in here though I won't critique the arguments of the book as that has been done wonderfully and adequately by other reviewers. Instead I'll take my soap box and say what really bothers me about this book - Behe's arrogance. And not just Behe's but that of the whole ID gang.Here's the basic argument: as we study biochemical processes we find systems whose origins are difficult or currently impossible to explain in a step-wise evolutionary scheme. Thus there must be a god who created these systems.Come on. This is really bad science - actually it's not science at all - and pretty damned poor religion (though I claim no particular expertise in that.) Behe is saying that since he just can't conjure up a scheme for this process surely god must have originated it. Jeeze. Maybe we ought to make a guy that smart president???
1,Is this Science?,The reviwers of this book fail to grasp the nature of scientific inquiry. Just because we don't understand something doesn't mean we never will. Darwin established the Central Dogma of Evolution by Natural Selection without the knowledge of basic genetics. When Mendel's experiments were brought into the realm of evolutionary thinking they fit into Dawin's model almost perfectly. Behe's book is interesting but it should not be taken as a means to an end. It should encourage scientists young and old to formulate new hypotheses that will broaden our knowledge of biochemistry rather than bogging it down in religious mythology.
5,Darwin's Theory - Still Just a Theory,"Prof. Behe deftly dissects Darwin's theory with clear and concise language. Behe explains irreducible complexity, then further weakens Darwinism by the simplicity of minimal function. Does Evolution exist? Of course. Natural evolution influences all creation. Every formula of chemistry and science began as theory and remained so until proven. Once proven, each formula progressed into accomplishment or at least, into understanding. But Darwin's Origin of the Species still remains - a theory that has accomplished nothing but progression into ignorance. I recommend Michael Behe's 'Darwin's Black Box'. If nothing else the reader will learn to ascertain truth and ask the questions, ""How? What? Where? Why?"" At the least, readers will come away with a clearer understanding of life and the universe."
2,"Behe's argument, old news and weak!","I am a Christian, but it is simply obvious that evolution has created all the life we see on Earth. Behe's argument is like that of an under-educated child... to say natural selection could not have occured because perpahps one advance at a time could in a system that is ""irreducibly complex"" not have aided said species survival is rediculous! I suggest that Behe reread his Darwin!"
5,Enjoyable Book,"Unlike Behe's detractors I found his book stimulating and informative. I found his logic easy to follow and his analogies insightful. It was a great introduction to this area of biochemistry for the lay person. I thoroughly recommend it, even if you don't agree with his conclusions."
2,"The old ""half-an-eye-argument"" once more.","So: Michael Behe can't imagine the bacterias flagellum being created step by step through natural selection.Should we - the lay people - be concerned? No. This is just the old ""half-an-eye-"" or ""half-a-wing-argument"" over and over. A little bit more sophisticated (most people don't know a lot about the bacterias inner organs), but the essence is the same: The author can not imagine (or better: his religion forbids him to imagine) evolution creating a complex structure, and uses his scientific authority to force his point.This is a book for those interested in creationistic arguments, or those who follow every little detail of evolution debate. Are you interested in evolution in general - read another book.Michael Behe gets 2 stars because he is a charming and polite man - and because he writes well."
5,Great book... a must read !,"Actually one of many great books that, in effect, expose the great religion of materialism for what it is (merely unsubstaniated speculation)... Dr. Behe does a great job of presenting more facts that dispell the rumor of truth surrounding evolution. I love how one reviewer states that Behe completely bypasses the scientific community. HELLOOOOO ! Behe is (part of) the scientific community. I guess he meant that Behe bypassed the flawed status quo within the scientific community. This is one of many like books that you must seek out and read to find the truth in all the smoke (smog). Just follow the money trails and you'll find the impetus behind the critics of Behe... Buy this book, read it, and judge it for itself !"
1,Creationist Babble in New Clothing,"There's not a single scientific idea in this dreck, just recycled creationist sludge."
1,A verbose debate that didn't convince me,"I've always asked questions to my parents and pastor at church. Some of the things we learned in school just didn't seem to add up with what was in the Bible. Dinosaurs and fossils for example always fascinated me. I still am interested in the ID/evolution debate and want to become well read on both sides of the debate before coming siding with on ideology over the other. Behe fails miserably for the ID side, his several examples are all reiterations of the same idea that never is able to prove that evolution couldn't happen. Either he doesn't understand the concept of evolution (doubtful) or he tries to appeal to an audience whom is not well read in science philosophy. His arguments are faulty and logically can not lead one to believe that life could not have evolved from lower forms. It seems to more I try to understand the ID side of the debate, the more I lean toward the evolution design side."
1,A Serious Waste Of Time!,"From the beginning it is obvious that this is written, not for and objective scientific community, but for a closed minded, fundamentalist christian audience. Behe's method works in the reverse of the scientific method: he has his conclusions and then tries to twist facts to fit his biased beliefs.For real information on evolution instead of creationist, irreducible stupidity, here are a couple of great books:""What Evolution Is"", by Ernst Mayr""Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution"", by Lynn Margulis"
1,Astonishingly ignorant,"I am a molecular biologist, and I can tell you that the level of ignorance on display in this book is absolutely astonishing. Behe manages to completely misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent evolution at every turn, then revels in victory when he counters these straw men. Behe claims to be a molecular biologist. I AM a molecular biologist. Behe knows nothing of evolutionary biology, or of science. This book needs to be re shelved into the Religion section, as that's what this book is: theology. It is as far from science as the Bible itself."
1,The age of rocks NOT the rock of ages,"The hidden premise of Behe's Darwin's Black box is this: ""If I poke enough holes in Darwinism then Creationism wins by default"" Sorry, it doesn't work that way.Let's assume that natural selection over long periods of time did not account for life as we know it today, then why is it that we NEVER find fossilized remains of modern mammals? Is it any wonder we don't find ANY fossilized remains of Homo erectus mixed in with dinosaur fossils??If Mr. Behe is so damn smart, instead of trying to pull a rabbit out of his hat all he has to do to pull a rabbit (or any other modern mammal) out of the Cambrian or Jurassic Period then he would be able to turn Darwinism on its head. Yes, it should be that easy!!!!Even if Darwin was not 100% correct on all the details, Evolution is still a fact!!!Accept it and move on!!!"
4,No single person has all the answers!,"Ok, I liked this book simply because it dosent take the, jump in line attitude. Lets open our minds just a little and realise that ""us humans"" dont have it all figured out.I thought Mr Behe stated his case in a plain yet eloquent manner. He simply stated facts that needed to be addressed before global agrement is achived.Darwin was in his 20's when he wrote origin of species he hadent devoted his life to anything yet isnt there room for error in that too? Buy the book, borrow it from a friend, just read it and decide for yourself. I thought it was good but,lets not be militant about it on either side. Bear minimum the book is well writen P.S heres a good question for those of you so bored you cant find anything else to do but gripe about books "" what came first the chicken or the egg?"""
3,This Book is what makes Science Work!,"Science is corrupt, it is adhered to like a religion and it has it's own False Gods. It disgusts me! But it is the best institution we have, given the primitive abilities of our species. It is the first one that attempts to control the inherent nature we all possess that often undermines our lives. For example to become fanatical about our beliefs, especially our ""Gods"". As an open minded individual who ""wants"" to believe in God, I welcomed this book. But I felt that the conclusion of Intelligent Design from irreducible complexity was one that rung of an ""agenda"". (which is ok, we all have them, but at Behe's level, one would think it would not have been a priori). We are hard wired for God, so I do keep hope alive. But one thing I would have thought Behe would say is that if there is a GOd, he is NOTHING like our current primitive notions embedded in our Judeo-Christian culture."
1,"As ""scientific"" as astrology","Michael Behe claims that Intelligent Design is a scientific theory, by his own definition of ""scientific"".However, under oath on the witness stand in Kitzmiller v. Dover (2005), Behe admitted that by his definition, ASTROLOGY is also a ""scientific theory"".So why pay for this book, when you could turn to your newspaper's horoscopes and get something just as ""scientific"" at a much lower price?"
5,Argument for Intelligent Design and Biochemistry Primer,"The author not only makes a powerful argument for inteligent design of living organisms, but includes a relatively easy to read Biochemistry Primer. I particularly enjoyed his analogies, such as the one about the bicycle factory. How does a bicycle factory turn out a complex motorcycle by an error (mutation) in construction? Read the book for his very interesting argument."
1,Faith passed off as science: an awful work!!!,"Behe's arguments are the same old irreducible complexity arguments peddled under the guise of molecular biology and passed off as a ""breakthough"" in our understanding of nature. Though an intelligent writer, Behe clearly doesn't want to understand natural selection. His claims that there are complex molecular structures that cannot be reduced into more primitive forms are hollow. Just like opponents of evolutionary science 100 years ago, he misses the point that there is a gradation of usefulness in the structures of living things. And that structure that are strictly speaking ""useless"" at one stage in evolution may become useful in combination with new attributes and environments at a later time. Behe would have the reader believe that living things are either perfect or absolutely impossible, but a little common sense and honest reflection shows that the business of survival never has been, nor will it ever be perfect."
1,Closet Creationist idiocy.,"Behe does not realize that analogy is not a method of reasoning. His beliefs are clearly creationist, he just wont admit it. Instead he brings back a two-century old argument from design. His examples are few and stretched. Anyone with a background in molecular biology(or just a college education) would laugh at his evidence based on proteins. Its clearly a religious ploy to try and trick people into turning against one of the best proven theories in science. Dont forget, theory is the highest form of scientific truth! While Evolutionary theory will always be revised and improved, the core concepts will remain intact. Behe is trying to get us to believe that the entire foundation of a well proven theory is nonexistent, based on scant evidence and incorrect logic. Wrong Century Behe!"
1,Tired Old Argument,"This book did nothing to convince me of the necessity of divine intervention. Come on all you creationists out there. I challenge you to make me believe! Present a compelling argument. Richard Dawkins refutes the only real point this author makes, that life is too complex to have arisen by chance, time and time again in his books."
1,I expected more.,"This book starts with the promise of leading us in new directions of thought, but ultimately is very disappointing to anybody who really understands modern theories of evolution. Instead of new ideas with merit, Behe appeals to ignorance by falling back on the outdated argument of Irreducible Complexity. If you have not seriously studied evolution, then you are likely to be fooled by Behe. It essential to have a solid understanding of evolution before reading this book."
1,"Havent you heard? Evolution is Fact, not a theory anymore.....","Michael J. Behe argues that many biochemical systems are irreducibly complex, and thus the result of intelligent design rather than evolutionary processes.This is a completely absurd idea, however compelling. You must consider that this book was first published in 1996 - Its ten years later and recent strides in evolutionary science point out that EVOLUTION IS NOT A THEORY ANYMORE - ITS FACT.Behe hides his claims by his ideas that cannot be subjected to falsability and that his definition of an irreducibly complex system is ambiguous, and that he ignores previous work in biochemical evolution.Why wont these Jesus Freaks let go?"
1,Fundamentalist Christian propaganda.,"Nuff' said. If you're a Christian, this just reaffirm what you already believe. If not, it won't convince you of anything. It's just politics."
4,Seen that mousetrap?,"I find it interesting that there is a lot of big brained-big worded criticisms to this work, yet no one has been able to produce a working mousetrap without all its parts. Seems to be a lot of attacking going on using words like insidious and dangerous. May I ask what would be wrong with a belief in God? I don't see where it could be any worse that where beleif in evolution has led us.I am an uneducated construction worker but just a simple browsing of a college biology book reveals that evolution is based on untold assumptions, imaginations,chances, and suppositions, but is taught as fact.I found this book to be a stimulating and worthwhile read and I hope more will be studied and published about these problems with Darwinism."
1,Obsolete the day it was printed,"It's time for this book to be recalled. Judge for yourself. Read Finding Darwin's God. Not only does it show how Behe is wrong, it also shows just how many of those who have written reviews here also have failed to do their homework before making unqualified assertions that are simply wrong. Irreducible complexity is like one of Aristotle's ideas about physics. It's fine in theory, but much different if you start looking at physical examples. For those who don't understand blood clotting from Behe's book, Finding Darwin's God gives you a second and better chance at it."
1,totally devioid of any scientific content,"Michael Behe's ""Darwin's Black Box"" is totally devoid of any scientific content. The concept of ""irreducible complexity"" is vacuous. Testifying in the ""Dover"" trial he said there was a test for irreducible complexity but he ""would not invest the time or effort to perform it"". Even Behe's own colleagues at Lehigh University (and the entire biology department) issued a statement that ID has no basis in science.Anyone still maintaining that ID and Behe's work has any credibility after the dreadful performance in Dover must be immune to any reasonable argument."
1,Moronic tripe,Behe's logic is flawed. The only proof for (sub)-intelligent design is for his orchestration of data meant to fit his hypothesis. He conveniently overlooks research that doesn't fit his model. One wonders at the level of scholarship tolerated at Lehigh U.
3,Concept flawed but thought provoking,"For the much of the scientific world ""irreducible complexity"" is an invitation to do more research; for others, it's an invitation to ponder the mystical. Behe invites us to dismiss the 200 year-old concept of bioogical evolution and the nearly 150 year-old record of successful application of natural selection for the sole reason that we don't understand everything. Still, the book has had effects far beyond its validity. As much as I find the book frustratingly narrow in concept, to many it has become the newest book of the Bible and has become a Must Read for the same reasons as Mein Kampf in the 1930s - not because it's right, but because some people believe it is."
1,Dangerous and complete nonsense,"Please see a complete reubuttal to this book and other ID ""science"" at:www.talkcreation.orgwww.talkdesign.orgwww.talkreason.org"
1,"Where are the birds, the bees, the bacteria?","Behe's book lends itself the veneer of science by giving a great deal of information on biochemistry. But he completely ignores natural history - the variety of living forms we see around us. Natural history makes a nonsense of Behe's arguments. Every one of the supposedly ""irriducibly complex"" biochemical systems that Behe describes exists in a simpler version somewhere in the natural world. (Is that a specific or a generality?)Behe - amazingly - compares himself to Darwin. The comparison is telling. Darwin came to his ideas by spending a lifetime observing the variation in the natural world. Behe came to his by willfully ignoring it."
1,Is Behe hiding something?,"Stuart Kaufmann offers a direct explanation for ""irreducible complexity"". He argues that life is not so improbable as our intuition or pride leads us to believe. This is a serious challenge for Behe, yet Behe does not engage this line of reasoning at all. Instead he: 1) conflates Kaufmann's book-length argument into a paragraph and then calls it ""fuzzy"", 2) notes that a critic called Kaufmann's work ""fact-free science"" (Kaufmann is a theoretical biologist working with high-level characterizations of biochemical and genetic systems, 3) complains that there are no chemicals listed in Kaufmann's index. Behe apparently doesn't want his readers to consider Kaufmann. Overall, his tone is perjorative and dismissive; the tone of someone with an indefensible postion."
2,Includes some good science; also includes flakey arguments.,"As others have already pointed out, Behe includes some useful discussions of biochemistry in this book. However, his understanding of their implications for evolutionary theory is quite limited, and his arguments do not hold up well under scrutiny.A correction to a comment made by an earlier reviewer: Charles Darwin made extensive use of the microscope in his decades of biological research after his return from the voyage of HMS Beagle. In fact, he designed an improved microscope to meet the demands of his work, and commissioned a leading London instrument maker to build it."
3,Worth reading thoughtfully.,"I agree wholeheartedly with the following comment, made by the reviewer of December 3, 1996:""If we can admit there is a definite mystery to origins and our existence, then one should not be asked to choose between doubt and belief, between creation and evolution, but should instead be allowed to mix both in due proportion."""
1,Completely Incompetent,"As a researcher in biochemistry, I can expertly state that this book is, for lack of a more focused term, bunk. The most extraordinary thing I learned reading this book was that such a plainly idiotic and mentally deficient man could receive tenure. His university must clearly regret that decision about as much as Germany regrets the Reich that occured after the second."
2,As Recommended by the Editors of Scientific Kansas,"A thorough and disciplined critic of the theory of natural section at the biochemical level perhaps. But when he gets to his arguments in favor of his counter-theory, well, he sounds like a rhetorically nimble Jesuit. See his recent New York Times op-ed piece for a concise summation of his logic."
2,I gave it two stars because it isn't horribly written,"It is, however, terribly inaccurate. Irreducible complexity is his main argument. He spends a few hundred pages trying to establish examples of irreducible complexity in nature. To the uninitiated he seems to do a good job of this. Unfortunately for him he is wrong. His examples are not irreducible he just couldn't figure out how to reduce them to simpler systems. The eye, the explosive beetle, blood clotting are all reducible. Even the mouse trap (his greatest example of irreducible complexity) is reducible! Read it like you read a Rush Limbaugh book and laugh at the absurd claims."
3,Barely worth it,"A good idea crushed by weak radio style acting. If the stories were simply narated and not played as though they were old time radio broadcasts, the stories themselves are interesting. Painfull to listen to in the car driving b/c of poor volume in recording. Get some othe Star Wars audio book."
5,Nontoxic Alternative to Vicks for Kids Stuffy Head Colds.,Our Alternative Medicine doctor suggested using this for when our kids can't sleep due to being congested and not being able to breath.Get some of this Salve and rub it on the bottoms of their feet (and possibly a small dot of it on their chests). Put socks on their feet.Voila... they can sleep.Nontoxic compared to Vicks with petroleum jelly.For babies this should not be used. Use the Nosefrida from Sweden. Gets the gunk out better and less violently than the bulb syringe thingy.
3,A watered-down paraphrase,"This book consists of a modern paraphrase of the Rule of Benedict. I found it very watered-down. The author equivocates about God (says you can use the Higher Power, the First Cause or whatever makes sense to you), and while there's nothing bad or evil about this, it goes against the spirit of the original text and it certainly dilutes the force of Benedict's argument.For someone who is familiar with the Rule itself, this paraphrase offers a refreshing new look, but it's no substitute for the real thing. (Probably the author does not mean for it to substitute for the real thing, and it will probably be read by people who will never pick up the real thing -- and there's no harm in that, I admit.) Those who are really curious about the Rule of Benedict should also get one of the widely available editions of that text."
2,ok for what I wanted it for,"I needed this item for a stuka deplay so it was ok for what I wanted it for. As far as toys go, it easy falls apart and there are small pieces a child may choke on."
2,"Popularly written, but shallow and not up to date","Is this a good book? Yes if you want an informal and readable first introduction to quantum computation; No if you want a book that provides you with rigorous up-to-date descriptions of the main results of quantum computation. In particular on the side of computer science there are some errors and omissions. The presentation of complexity theory is not very good, and Grover's quantum search algorithm is not covered. Better grab a good free introduction from the web (for instance John Preskill's notes at Caltech)."
1,No detailed information,"""Explorations in Quantum Computing"" is an expensive book, but if you are looking for a good introduction to quantum computing visit a preprint server. A lot of free and good introductions are available. Therefore there is no need to buy a book without the necessary detailed information."
5,Just what I needed!,My mom got this CD for me to get some ideas of what I might want played at my wedding. It had exactly what I was looking for. I am having a lady sing one song and another song played off of the CD. It contains a little bit of everything that is perfect for all different types of Christian weddings. It was a good move on my mom's part!
3,Accompaniment disk wasn't exactly what I was looking for..my fault for not reading the description better,Worked well for my daughters wedding.. Like the music but I was looking for a disk with the words too.
5,PNY-RAM for iMac,WORKS GREAT! Easy to install although I had to use my iMac book for installation....no problems. Rebate was offered when I purchased PNY-128RAM and I received it...no problem. IT'S JUST RAM-you like it becasue you need or want it for computer performance.
5,Solid,A decent album. It repeats many of the same themes from other Hendrix albums. She seems more adventurous musically. Recommended.
2,Tough Going,"I was attracted to this book because I am an armchair archaeology buff. I managed to read it,however it was tough going. It is not readably written and is clearly aimed at professionals in the field. It focuses narrowly on the archaeological finds from the Bronze age which are primarily weapons. There is little attempt to flesh out the everyday lives of the people of the time. The author is more concerned with documenting every forth word. He doesn't correlate with any of the recent work in other fields such as linquistics or genetics. I was attracted to the cover picture. He eventually reveals that it is a drinking scene.Unfortunately it is cropped so that the steins are obscured.I was frustrated that he never gives any explanation of the garments depicted. There have been finds of ancient fabrics as attested to by Elizabeth W.Barber and her collegues. Women's work doesn't seem to interest Kristiansen.Unless you need it for your PhD.I suggest you give it a pass."
3,Marvelous digital camera,"We wanted a zoom lens with significant range so the 10x Camedia was an obvious candidate, and then purchase. We are very happy with the product. The 2MP CCD produces excellent shots with flawless color rendition and beautiful sharpness. Battery life is excellent. We use and carry Panasonic NiMH rechargeables. The most remarkable thing about the C-700 is its ability to shoot in true color indoors in dim light. We shot dozens of pictures in medieval churches in Italy a few weeks ago, all without flash of course, and they were perfectly exposed. Amazing! Think very, very seriously about buying this camera."
1,"Great potential,but","The C-700 is a camera I could really like if I could get it repaired. my C-700 is in the shop For the 2nd time. Can you believe Olympus repair sent it back to me, the first time without checking to see if it was working, it wasn't. I wish I had sent it back to Amazon.com before the time ran out. When I got the camera I rated it 4 stars, now I rate it one."
5,Perfect!,I am no techno-geek... I knew almost nothing about digital cameras before I got this. I love it. It does take a little getting used to and time to figure out how to do certain things. But I have taken great pictures and have been able to print them with great success. I highly recommend this camera!
4,"Excellent camera, brilliant pictures","I love this camera. The zoom is what makes it great. I would like better than 2.1 megapixels, but with the flash, I have literally thousands of great shots. We have a new baby, and I have taken lots! I only gave it 4 stars because the focusing could be a little faster.Buy a smart media reader, so you don't use up battery life formatting, and copying images. NM-Hi batteries last a long time in this camera, even when you use the screen on the back for viewing.Use the SHQ quality (1600x1200), you don't need the TIFF format, it is not that much better."
2,Good Camera,"I am not totally sure what to think except some things stick out right away that I do NOT like about the camera.Negative1. The shutter is VERY, VERY, slow.2. The supplied 8MB media card is too little. The saving grace is the Free 64 MB mail-in.3. 50% of the pictures I take are blurry.4. No power cable. That is an extra(...).5. ASM - you have to go to the menu to switch between A and SPositive1. 10X optical (never use digital, your software can do that)2. Fairly easy to use3. Good manual settingsI have an old Sony Mavica FD7 and Never get blurry pictures even at 10X zoom. All my picture were easy to take and now my kids use it w/o any difficulty at all. I don't see that the c-700 uses very good fixed settings on the dial (portrait, etc.)I am still seeing if I can get more out of this camera but need alot of convincing weather to keep it or return it."
4,Not bad Not the best I have seen,I bought this camera becouse of it's 10X zoom and becouse I liked the price range. I Loved the camera when I bought it but I found out the picture quality takes a back seat in low light. images are blury and grainy.Over All I would say buy it.
3,Disappointed,"I was really anticipating getting this camera because all the reveiwers seemed to rave about it. I also wanted a digital with great zoom capabilties. The camera is light-weight and user friendly. It has an awesome zoom ability. BUT... the stability is poopy, unless you have extremely steady hands or a tripod everything comes out blurred. If you want to capture a spur of the moment photo forget about it! I'm sorry to give a poor review but I feel the stability is a major drawback and I will be exchanging mine for something else once I do a little more research."
4,Taking pictures indoor with low light,"Some of the reviews prior this one told completely opposite stories abouts the ability of this camera to take photographs indoor and with low light. Probably, the truth is NOT thatthe C-700UZ isn't able to work well in such conditions, but rather that ITS AUTOMATIC MODES are not suitable for indooroperation with poor light. In such a case, all what one has to do is to switch from automatic to program or manual mode,and set the sensitivity to a fixed value among 100, 200 and 400 ISO - but not to 800 ISO, and, most important, NOT to AUTOMATIC selection. DON'T LET the sensitivity value be automatically selected, by the camera itself, because it will be almost certainly set beyond400 ISO, and you'll end up with ugly, grainy pictures, due to the color noise raised by the excess of sensitivity."
2,ok --when it worked (for only 6 months),"This camera suddenly stopped working after less than 6 months of light use. Olympus said it would take 10-14 days to get it back. They received it 6 weeks ago, and I'm still waiting. Getting through to customer service, or getting an email back is a nightmare. Buy a camera that is more reliable!"
3,Not Good For Low Light,I was in love with this camera for a while because I was using it to take pictures while hiking. The Zoom feature and all the manual settings made it the perfect camera for me. Then I tried taking pictures indoors and the first think that goes wrong is that you can't see a thing through the view-finder because it is a digital image and without a lot of light you can't even see your target. An even bigger problem was when taking the picture the auto focus never seems to work properly without a lot of light. Very disappointed with the indoor use of this camera.
2,"Nice features, terrible pictures","Loved the features this camera offered. It does takes pictures very quickly, but I was disappointed with the picture quality. The pictures seem dark and washed out. My Kodak DC215 takes much better pictures. Maybe I just needed to adjust something, but it doesn't retain your settings after powering off, so I'd have to set it every time. Also, it defaults to medium image quality every time it is powered off - very annoying. I think I will try the Kodak DC4800 instead."
3,Sole not Durable,"I have owned three pairs of these shoes. Obviously, I like them, however, the soles have gotten a hole in them quiite quickly. I use them when walking my dogs which means walking on asphalt. If you just want these for running errands I suspect the sole will hold up. My most recent pair wore out in less than a season so I replaced them with a pair of Timberlands that had a more substantial sole."
5,Great Shoe,"This is my third season wearing this shoe. I live in Michigan and the winters are cold, damp and snowy. These shoes keep my feet warm and dry and are comfortable. I definitely would recommend these shoes. They do run a little big. I normally wear a size 11 and I purchased these in a size 10 and they fit perfectly. I brag about them so much to my husband, he's now looking on the internet to find a pair for himself."
2,big big ice muckers,I ordered these for winter. We have a lot of snow and ice in our region.They were much wide and long. I was surprised as I wear clarks shoes almost every day.
4,f train gets an A,"i really loved reading the f train. The insights and the revealing of each characters flaws, physically and mentally; reveal more about us then we might want to admit.anxiety, depression which lead to the self healing potion of alcohol; which in turn leads to more destruction.Zalta has a way of narrarating that reminds me of jd salinger and f scott fitzgerald.there are editing errors and some rookie mistakes though, and i look foward to his next work!"
4,Perfect for busy parents,"I got this for free and thought it looked kind of cheesy, but it has turned out to be an extremely convenient way to keep track of my baby's development. I don't have time to write in a book every day (or even every week) but a sticker, I can do. The artwork is a little precious for my tastes, but I think it will probably age better than something edgier that I would have picked out, and I think it is the kind of thing that will appeal to my daughter when she is old enough to look at it herself. I will probably try to find something similar for future children and would consider buying one as a gift too."
2,Ok calendar,"Calendar seems cheaply made, but does have all essentials to keep track. My friends have better ones... I'd keep looking..."
5,Best Sticker Calendar,"We received this as a gift with our first daughter. When looking for our 2nd child, I looked at a bunch of other ones. All had less stickers and weren't gender neutral. I love that the op of each page has room for stats and other memories. I found the calendar approach much less time consuming then an actual book which I would dread doing."
3,Looks great but uncomfortable,These look like Willy Wonka glasses. I added some padding on the nose piece because they are not flexible and can cut into the nose a bit. I can deal with the comfort issues but the red tint is reflective on the inside so a person will be half blind when wearing them. They served their purpose as part of my halloween costume.
3,Not in the same league,"Peter Turnbull's Glasgow series has been one of my special favorites since the first book. That said, Fear of Drowning, introducing a new series and new characters, simply doesn't compare. While the writing is as good as ever, and the characters are well-drawn, there's an air of fatigue hovering over this slim tale--as if the author has run out of energy. It's very disappointing. There are no surprises, the solution to the murders of Max and Amanda Williams is pretty well telegraphed, and then the book simply ends. Clunk.If you're expecting the intensity and quality of Turnbull's previous books, you won't find it in this one. It reads almost as if it were written by someone else, someone lacking the compulsion to look at the dirt in the cracks the way the old Peter Turnbull did."
2,A change should be welcome.,"I have enjoyed Turnbull's Glasgow series but the characters and their relationship to each other had become a bit stale. A change should be good, but, I would rather he had developed the Glasgow characters a bit more and explored the cliques and conflicts that are likely to develop within such a group, rather than trying to create another scene and cast of characters."
5,What a great book!!!!,Finally a book I can relate to. Too Many good-byes is emotional but not like a romance novel. It is easy to follow and you can feel what is going on. The book is the last book of the series and really pulls all the books together. This book is about teo girls who had finally had fully adjusted to their school. Then out of the blue they find out that they are moving. They are both in realashonships with boys. So this puts them both in a emotional roller coaster. Overall this book was really exciting and great. Anyone who reads this book with definately like it.
2,okay,this was okay. it was kinda boring. all the Wakefields didnt want to move 2 utah and thats was it. i wish they would write more about Lila and Aaron and stuff. i also wish Damon and Jess brake up cuz hes boring.
3,Sufficient information but poor written,I believe this book contains sufficient information in order to learn and understand Real Estate Finance basics. At the same time the book is poor written and has considerable number of errors and contradictions. It is pretty hard to read and understand some of the chapters.
2,I've seen better - a lot better.,"Kind of far fetched. Seemed like they developed the hero around the cure. It was like the writers kept changing senerios and adding to the reasoning as the story plot developed, to justify the ending."
3,Fair SciFi Fare that....,"This is a fair scifi offering that gets better as it progresses. When it started, I thought, oh well, another not so good science fiction that I wished was better. Then it got better.Kind of put me in mind of the old scifi's like the Blob and The Stuff, and newer like The Ruins. Worked pretty well and became better as it went along. About a biological weapon developed late 50's and then locked away in an underground vault. Forgotten, the army base is abandoned and later scheduled for demolition. Guess what happens.Won't ruin the story for you but it is a good addition if you get it on DVD for $7 or less shipped. One thing you'll notice is some of the computer graphics aren't great, but the creature effects are actually pretty good. It doesn't have attempts at humor like the Stuff, so don't expect that. It is a little predictable, a little slow very early on but the pace picks up. Acting is good from the main characters. A good watch you might view from time to time."
2,"Bad, boring, B","Bad acting, idiotic dialogs, clumsy action, predictable situations... Yawn. Perfect for a Sunday afternoon after being dumped by your girl/boyfriend."
4,better than expected after reading some reviews,Been watching horror movies for half a century now and this one in comparison is better than alot I've seen. Ending like alot of movies in this genre is wanting but for the most part movie was enjoyable watching
4,A serious Martial Arts Movie,"Although the action sequences were quite short(except for the final duel), this is one of the more serious martial arts movie I have seen. Angela Mao and Wang Tao were spectacular. Mao was so serious that you rarely saw her smile. The plot was twisted and good, and it was hard to tell who the bad guys were. A story of deceipt and betrayal. There was a good reason behind all the fight scenes, rather than people looking for every excuse to fight like in some other kung-fu movies. Though you might think it is slow paced at times, this is a good movie to keep. The sound quality was not very good though."
1,I cant believe I paid $10 for this!!!,I bought this movie because I thought it was a Shaw Brothers movie. Being a Vemon's fan since I was like maybe 7 I thought this would be of the usual great Shaw Brother's fashion that was from 1975 through 1981. Oh what a disaster. Ugh the worst movie ever. I watched it all of the way through hoping at least the ending fight scene would be worth it. Nothing but disappointments. This movie came up when I searched Shaw Brothers but this is not what I expected. I feel bad for the actress because I think she had some real skills but this movie was so awful they werent even marginally presented here. Ugh dont let me get started on how they play out the plot...I could go on and on...
3,"The Nephilim: Future, Past, and Present",The book was more poetic than informational. Did not help my research as much as I'd hoped.
1,waste of money,"I would have given it 0 stars if I could. A waste of money. The author has written random 1 or 2 sentence thoughts and made ""chapters"" out of them. The whole ""book"" is about 300 WORDS long. I may be overstating that. I considerd it a rip off when I saw it. The author was steaing my money,DONT LET HIM STEAL YOURS!"
3,good book for sci-fi fans,"I found this book at a used-book store in Wisconsin and bought it solely for one of its newer stories -- the original Ender's Game novella, by Orson Scott Card -- later turned into an award-winning novel. However, in reading the other stories, I found that some of the other stories are quite good. The authors are your basic sci-fi group -- Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, etc. -- and some newer ones, like Card. The stories themselves are good science fiction, if not particularly deep -- none of them really stick with you as 'great literature', some of them -- like the Asimov story -- have a gimmick that can carry the story well. Generally this is an anthology for those who are already fans of science fiction war stories -- a small population, but one who would enjoy this book."
2,They leak - not using Evenflo bottles,"We used lvl 1 nipples on our evenflo, avent, and Medela bottles with no problems. These level 2s leaked in all of our bottles. We aren't using the evenflo bottles anymore since she drinks more than 4oz at a time now. At any rate, they're leaking and I've thrown them out. :o("
2,"too fast, daughter refused","The weird X in the top (instead of a hole) made fluids pour too easily from the nipple. My daughter wouldn't use them and they were a waste of time. On the other hand, they were the final step in weaning her off the bottle (at two years). So, they're good for that."
3,Fine nipple for a toddler using glass bottles,"We found these silicone nipples worked much better than the classic latex nipples, which had a lot of friction when screwing the cap on. After several months of use by a toddler with sharp teeth they tend to tear, and should be replaced for safety (so a piece does not accidentally come free and become a choking or ingestion hazard). They have an X in their top, and are indeed quite fast flowing. After some use, they may even leak if the bottle is lying on its side (or shaken by your child).However, now that there are bpa-free plastic bottles available (such as Avent) we would not recommend glass bottles (they break creating dangerous glass shards, and are quite hard when your child accidentally hits you with it or it gets dropped on your feet). So I would have avery low review of glass bottles. But once you have the glass bottles, these nipples are fine."
3,Not really fast flow,The holes in these are about the same size as the slow flow ones of the same brand. I'm not really sure why they're called fast flow because it's not like there were extra holes or anything.
1,hole way too big,"My little one was sucking way to hard on the medium flow to the point where i would have to take the bottle out and let the nipple inflate back up again so that he could get the milk, so I went out and purchased a bunch of the classic fast flow. Well instead of there being a hole, there is a large x shape at the top and the milk poured into his mouth and he just ended up choking on the milk. What a waste! Instead, the evenflo combi flow nipples are SO MUCH BETTER, so try those out. He doesnt choke on the milk because there is just a hole."
4,"Good, basic nipples","My baby has always used Evenflo nipples. At 3 months, he was having a hard time getting the milk to flow through the 0-3 month nipples, so we bought some of the 3-6 month and 6+month nipples. The 6 month nipples flowed too fast even at 5 months, but now that he's 6 months, they work perfectly for him."
2,Again a disappointment,"EA has produced FOOTBALL games since the beginning of dawn, and they have almost always been a disappointment. This time again. The gameplay of this game is insufficient. The option on your strategy arent available. Of course the game has its good things. The sounds and graphics are good, the fact that u play with the actual players superb. But, in the end, if u want a good football game go for Pro Evolution Soccer or for Winning Eleven. If u just want a simple game go for Eufa 2004, or even better (and cheaper) Fifa 2004"
2,Winning Eleven 7 wannabe,"This game tries to come close to the gameplay of Winning Eleven 7, but it doesn't even come close.Get Winning Eleven 7 if you want to play a true 'FOOTBALL' (and not, its not soccer) game."
3,American people...,"This isn't interesting for you people, maybe because you are not from europe, land of soccer and land of Euro Championship. Think of this like an expansion pack for Sims.Keep Practicing."
3,Enjoyable piece of fluff,"Haven't seen the show, but the CD is fun to listen to. Some songs are funny and cute (""Show Off,"" ""I Remember Love""); others are, well, a bit dull (""I am Aldolpho, Adolpho, Adolpho, Adolpho, Aaadddooolllphooooo . . .""). But on the whole it comes across as a sweet little show, and the cast is stellar. Also, the liner notes with all the detail about the fake musical-within-the-musical are very cleverly done."
2,"Costumes were Great, Music was Zzzzz","I loved the costuming for the show & the ""Man In Chair"" was a riot, but the music was not memorable. I think I'll take a nap!"
5,Escape from reality,"If you had the chance to see this show, then when you listen to this recording you will be doing the same thing as ""Man in Chair"": reliving the show. From the opening prayer (not heard on the recording-unfortunately) until the end, you can relive every hilarious moment of the show. Everyone who has ever put in a recording of ANY broadway show and acted out scenes or relived the performance in their mind will be able to understand the brilliance of the show. Perhaps those who have given negative reviews of this recording have not seen the show, or don't understand the point. It's a musical for those who love musicals. My best advice, try to see the show. I was lucky enough to win the lottery draw and was able to see the show in the front row. Even if i had sat way in back, it would still make me laugh. Bottom line, Go see it, and then you will ""get"" the recording more"
2,"OK, But Wouldn't Classify As A One Star","From reading the other reviews, it seems that people either completely like (5 star) or hate (1 star) this music. I'm probaly more in the middle. The score has its moments, but there are so many better ones out there. Five Star? - no way, but One Star seems a bit off as well."
5,Hysterical! Genius! A Treasure!,"I live in the midst of the theatre district in NYC and see tons of Broadway shows on a regular basis. I can honestly say I can't remember laughing harder than the first time I saw ""Drowsy..."" When Sutton Foster did her ""Show Off"" number I fell out of my seat, overheating with hysterical laughter. I've seen the show 3 times so far -- which is a first for me. The CD is great, too. Buy it and sing along! If you like over-the-top, unique, clever musical comedy, this is the show for you, baby!"
2,Disappointing At Best,"I had the opportunity to see the show and was relatively disappointed. The premise was fairly interesting, but did not feel the same for the production's score. Last year's crop of new scores were so much better."
5,Excellent!,Nice recording of current Broadway production. Sutton Foster is great - now we need the cast recording of Thoroughly Modern Millie!
2,At Least It Was Original,"My husband & I recently saw this show as it was one of the few original shows to come out this year. The songs were ok, but nothing really stood out for us. I purchased the cd as a memento, but enjoyed the show's visuals & comedy (especially, the ""Man In Chair"" who was hysterical) better than the cd itself. I would have rated this as average, but deducted a star since my husband fell asleep in the show."
2,Failry Unmemorable Score,"Since the label decided to move up the release date of this cd to coincide this weekend's Tonys, I decided to run out & pick it up. What a waste! While a couple of the tracks are ok, this score is fairly bland. Other cds for this year's crop of shows, namely ""Jersey Boys"", ""Sweeney Todd"", & even ""The Wedding Singer"", are much better."
2,Whole Family Fell Asleep In This One,"During a week trip to New York, we got to see Tarzan, Drowsy Chaperone & Color Purple. This one put us all to sleep. Tarzan wasn't much better, but at least the kids liked it. CP was best!"
1,ZZzzz - Please Wake Me When Its Over,"Obviously, this music is entertaining to some, but I thought it was nothing but boring dribble. ZZzzz"
2,The Drowsy Chaperone-Original Cast,"I often refer to this as ""The Lousy Chaperone"". The music is lackluster with no memorable tunes and very inane lyrics. I've heard a lot of hype about the show but based on this soundtrack I would not want to spend over $100 to see the musical."
2,Not The Worst Score Ever - Still A Yawnfest,"Broadway has produced so much great and memorable music over the years ... even from bad shows. ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" is a fairly entertaining show, but the score never rises much above mediocrity. There are ceratinly worse scores out there, but to have been awarded a Tony for Best Score should merit something much better than this. Yawn."
1,Why would anyone pay $110 to see this?,"Terrible, simply terrible. Why would anyone pay $110 to see this? Thankfully the purchase of this cd saved me from seeing the show."
1,Major disappointment,"I was looking forward to hearing this CD after everything I had read and heard about the production, but I found it a major disappointment. The premise of a fusty old show queen liking a show this bad just didn't work for me. The songs are more TV jingle-like than anything that recalls music from the Roaring '20s. I gave up trying to wade through the synopsis to figure out why Sutton Foster is singing that dull--and LONG!--song about the monkey. Cute is not a substitute for witty--the writers of this show must not know that. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,As We STUMBLE Along.. Dear god!,"The Broadway show was OK, but the score was its weakest point. This CD will bore you to tears. It is sad they only included 12 tracks and left all the other ""good"" music/dialogs out (they probably will include all of them in a different CD coming out soon, priced a lot higher). I wish I could say something better, but the music is just boring and repetitive, IMO. I suggest you buy a different Cast Recording, possibly THE PAJAMA GAME, SWEENEY TODD or THE WEDDING SINGER.. all three are much better then this drek."
5,The Drowsy Chaperone,"This is one of the most delightful, entertaining musical in years, and the recording is just as enjoyable. It should be with every collector."
4,The Drowsy Chaperone,"Recalls the 20's era, with music and typical lyrics. I like the premise of The Drowsy Chaperone, and thought it well executed. Wish I had been able to see the show live."
1,Weak Score,"""As We Stumble Along"" is not a bad song, but the rest of this score is pretty weak. Best part of the show was the ""Man In Chair""'s dialogue. Score reminds me a bit of ""Me & My Girl"" back in the late eighties, but M&MG was much much better."
2,Disappointing & Cheesey,"There are some high points, but mostly the music was disappointing and cheesey."
2,Want Something Fun? See Avenue Q Instead,"This was not the experience I had hoped for. Parts were ok, but nothing compared to the brilliance of ""Q""."
1,DROWSY IS RIGHT,"""The Drowsy Chaperone"" has a neat concept and that's it. The music and lyrics have no bite to be satiric and are not funny to be comedic. What is left are songs so desperately trying to evoke a 20s' musical, they sweat. ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" from a few seasons back was also a 20s' musical but didn't try to shove the period setting down our throats and was effortless and charming. ""Drowsy"" has been blessed by some of the critics trying to fool the public into thinking they will be having a great time watching this snoozer. This deception won't last for long as Broadway audiences are more savvy than that. Incidentally, Sutton Foster who played the title role in the above-mentioned ""Millie"" seems to have poor judgment in choosing roles-the dreadful ""Little Women"" and now this.If she keeps appearing in turkeys I may have to invite her over for Thankgiving dinner.The one-star is for the clever booklet accompanying the CD but after that.....BEWARE!"
2,"Original? - Yes, but Fairly Uninteresting!","I don't undertand the hype...and found the musical fairly uninteresting. Now the ""drowsy"" part makes sense."
2,"Fun Show, Weak Score","I enjoyed seeing the show earlier this month and, although the performances were fun, I didn't particularly enjoy listening to this cd. The score is simply not as strong."
1,I ACTUALLY LIKED TARZAN BETTER THAN THIS DRIVLE,"Never thought I would say it, but Tarzan's score is better than this lame effort. Buyers ... Beware!"
3,"OK, but Nothing Particularly Special","With all the pre-Tony media blitz associated with this show, I decided to give the score a good listen & decide for myself. Frankly, there was nothing terribly special about the score. Mind you, I didn't dislike it either, but only one or two songs merit repeat listens: ""Show Off"" & ""As We Stumble Along"". Maybe I would have enjoyed it a bit better if I had seen the show this Spring? Second thought, I'm glad I saw ""Jersey Boys"" & ""Sweeney Todd"" instead."
1,A Show for Old Ladies,"Simply put, I thought the show was an overall bore! Nothing was particularly interesting or fresh about the score either. What was all the fuss about? Too bad ""Kight In The Piazza"" is gone ... that was fresh!"
1,Must Be Over 70 to Enjoy,"This musical was trite & boring ... maybe I would have enjoyed if I was older, but instead its in the ""never to be played again"" stack."
1,Seriously Boring,"Just saw Wicked & Drowsy this week. Polar opposites: Wicked was terrific, Drowsy bored me to tears. Wish I hadn't purchased this cd beforehand!"
2,Mixed Emotions,"I purchased this cd before seeing the show and just did not understand the hype. The music is fairly bland - though a couple of songs had promise. Finally saw the show & it is cute (esp. the obsessed showtune-loving ""Man In Chair""), but not entirely what I had hoped for. I have listened to the music since, but it simply is better in the context of the show, and even then, only fair. Show: *** 1/2 ; Music: **"
3,OK,Great original tunes........Appreciate being able to find this cd on the internet. No good music stores withing 100 miles.Thanks
5,Preserved in Amber,"In spite of the primitive quality of the recordings, it is a priceless experience to hear the voice of Komitas singing these rare Armenian peasant tunes as he heard them in the early 20th century, captured just 3 years before the Armenian Genocide would wipe out the populations from whom he collected them, and lead to Komitas' own decline into insanity. Recorded in Paris in 1912, the priest-scholar-musicologist sings about half of the songs on the CD, while his student sings the rest. Particularly beautiful and moving is the ""Kristos Pataragyal"", the heart of the Armenian Mass. A precious artifact of the soon-to-be shattered culture, here preserved like a fly in amber."
2,alienating,"First, the title of the CD is misleading since it is not Komitas who sings, but a student of his. Second, the music may be celebrated by Armenians, but is in fact dull and lackluster: a mixture of opera and folklore, taking the worse sides of both arts. The whole experience is not unpleasant, but in the end I remained quite alienated from this type of music: it rang no bells (which was expected: I bought the CD so as to hear something new), but it did not make me more curious about Armenian music either. The quality of the first track is so poor, that it should have been omitted: even gthe greatest admirers of Komitas will certainly skip the piece anytime they listen to the other ones."
2,Seriously?,"I Have these wonderful headphones and I use the foam buds because none of the rubber ones fit my ears. That said, you have to replace the foam ones every month or two depending how gross you can stand them and at 40 for a measly 5 pairs: that's a total rip-off."
2,"neat book, but not worth the money",Why pay 10 bucks for URLs? It is easier to just go to a bookstore and spend a minute copying the best ones.
1,I.M.O.G.C.A.W. is a great buy when compared to retail but falls short of actually being a wearable watch,"This watch was a great value. I'm not in love with the dial color, but like it otherwise so ya don't buy it buy like a $4000 Rolex. Cool"
4,nice suit,"I like this suit because the print is really beautiful. The back of the suit is a ""T"" shape which is nice. It helps to concel the places I like covered up. The only negative is that I wish I could adjust the straps to support my bust more. I would recommend this suit to other plus size costumers."
5,The next leap in human evolution,Something inside everyone knows that one day we'll be able to wake up to a whole new world where the human race is totally in love with each other. This wonderful book is a do-it-yourself manual for the next leap in human evolution. It is full of excellent information and practical techniques for moving smoothly into the new consciousness. See you in 4D!
4,"Wonderful insights and ""nuggets"" of practical wisdom for now!","I really like the information and insights in this book for personal growth and spiritual development in these challenging times. The text offers practical and logical processes to work with in helping individuals maintain an internal ""balance"" during these shifting times. With so much going on in the external world, it is ever important to keep ourselves grounded and focused in our internal world. Lyssa Royal is able to offer these insights from many years of practice and working with others worldwide. I use many of the processes and meditations she offers in this work and find them extremely beneficial for myself, and others that I have shared them with. A worthwhile entry into my library of personal and spiritual development in my opinion. So far, I have purchased 5 additional copies for family/friends. So, I guess that is a YES! vote for this text.Kelli in Sedona"
5,An excellent recording of excellent contemporay music.,I first heard this CD 3 years ago when I was in a choir singing Gloria and Requiem. It blew me away and made singing the works all the more enjoyable! An amazing experience.
5,Sacred Music,Very inspiring. Will definitely drive me to eventually acquire all of this composer's work.
2,Poorly Recorded,"The music is wonderful, of course, but this is an old recording that needs to be remastered. The sound quality is awful. Look elsewhere for the breadth of expression these pieces deserve. For you Gloria fans, the Wallace Collection with Andrew Lumsden (Stephen Layton, cond.) gives a much better and energetic treatment to this piece."
1,Let's be honest,"This stuff is tacky. John Rutter's compositions are notorious among real musicians for being cheap and sentimental. His anthems are the church-music equivalent of the Big Mac, which has sold billions and billions of copies, but which neither nourishes nor satisfies. The music quickly bores the serious musician and leaves him with a tune he wishes he could get out of his head. If you like Rutter's music, go to it; he's produced a bevy of CDs to keep you happy. But don't mistake it for real music. Rutter is an unabashed sellout who's made a pretty penny pandering to people's basest musical tastes."
5,Rutter's genius truly shines on this disc.,"This CD is capable of stirring even the most heart-hardened individual. ""Gloria"" opens this collection with great fanfare and exhibits Rutter's compositional capabilities with the choir and full orchestral setting. The subsequent anthem settings, without exception, are some of the most moving pieces I've ever experienced from both a content and compositional standpoint. This CD is a glimpse of heaven itself that we can enjoy here and now."
3,Great for beginners,"The price of this flute continues to range between $130-$140. Its keys occasionally get stuck, as all flutes from online do. It may not be suitable for an advanced player, but it is perfect for beginners. The cables come out of place every so often, but it's simple to put them back into place. It's a much better deal rather than buying a flute from your average music store."
1,Not a good instrument,"I bought this for my son for his school music class after reading reviews here at Amazon in September 2008. Now after 3 months, the keys are giving problem; when you press one key, other keys also are pressed. My son's teacher asked me to show it to a music shop for fixing it and the music shop guy tells me it is not a good quality instrument and cannot be repaired/fixed. I recommend staying away from this. It will be a piece of junk in 2-3 months of use. The carrying case is substandard. The rivets in the hinges got loose."
3,priced more,This is a basic entry level flute; I didn't expect it to be professional quality. I was short for time because my daughter needed it ASAP. I found this one here and figured I would go for it only because shipping time was shorter than other stores. Shipping was on time and flute plays as it should. Flute is priced almost more than same brand at other websites. If you're not in a hurry buy the lowest price flute from other stores and you will be getting the same brand name as this one...
1,Did not receive item as requested.,"I ordered a flute on August 31, 2007. So I called on September 10, 2007. The day it was supposed to arrive. I called and was told it was on back order,but the owner says he could overnight it to me if I agreed to split the cost of overnighting it. I was told that he contacted Amazon about the the backorder. Amazon had no record of it. I feel I was misled and was asked to pay more to cover his mistake. Thank you Amazon for your help in resolving this matter."
2,Bad Quality Instrument,"This is a bad quality instrument. After a few months, the air was leaking out of one of the keys. I couldn't play an ""F"". I took it to the repair shop, but they said they wouldn't repair it because it was a bad quality instrument and it was too cheap. Also, the real instrument looks different from the image that is shown."
3,MIxed feelings,I had a more expenisve flute that was lost when we relocated. I waited a while but then could resist the urge to buy another one but I could afford to spend the same amount of money as I did on my last one. The signature flute was okay for the money but if you are an active player then I recommend buying a few steps up. The seats arent as well made as I am used to using and it needed a tune up right out of the box; even though it was brand new.
2,Not so great Flute,"This may be a good flute for grown ups but if you are planning to buy for your kids band, then it may be better to just rent one. Just after 3 months getting this flute, my Son's teacher started complaning about it. We can't even fix it locally."
1,2nd Time This Flute Has Failed Us!,"Ok, bought this thing in September 2012. By December, my child complained about his flute not working properly. The 4th pad from the end of the flute does not close all the way. The reason I am angry about this is that this is the 2nd flute I purchased (Hisonic) and BOTH of them have the same failure. We sent the flute out for repair only to have the repair shop (who specializes in flutes) refuse to work on it. Their reasoning was that no parts or support are available. We ended up buying a used name brand flute at a pawn store for $70 cash. BEWARE ALL!"
3,Beginner flute only!,"I've had this flute for about three days. This flute would be perfect for a beginner only. It's been twelve years since I last played. The key pads were a tad sticky and the case it came in is very poor quality. I literally have to force the flute into the box to make it sit right. Also, the cleaning rod is basically a thick plastic stick that when used with the cloth it comes with, doesn't even fit inside the flute! I will have to buy a new rod and cloth. If you don't mind a cheaply made case and cleaning kit, then the flute works for a beginner as opposed to renting or buying a higher priced flute. It is a good price for a student though!"
4,Good product,"I bought this as a present for my wife who wanted a decent beginners flute. It has good sound and is well made. She is very happy with it. It took about 2 weeks to come in, which was okay, but a little slower than I would have expected. Overall we are very happy with the purchase."
5,Better than the original !,Far better than the original hose !!!! Replacing this part saved me fro buying a whole new burner unit !
3,"High quality hose, so-so regulator","This works as advertised. The hose and fittings are very good quality and the regulator is adjustable. The regulator is a little on the coarse side, so a small turn of the knob changes the pressure a lot. A pretty good product for a very fair price."
5,Propane hose,This hose works great and fits the Bayou Classic just like the original but is much better. Original had rubber hose not the new braided one which is much sturdier and safer to use and also this has a secondary flow adjuster which the original did not have. Now our Bayou Classic is cooking again.
1,not delivered as shown,very disappointed that the hose pictured was not what was sent. The picture clearly shows a seperate valve to the left of the regulator. What was sent was a regulator valve combo. why would they show one style and ship another. probably my first and last purchase w/ amazon.
5,At the Copa! Copacabana! the Hottest Spot North of Havana!,"Every Barry fan should have this movie with their fan collection & memorabilia! Barry gave a wonderful performance in this movie as ""Tony Starr"". I enjoyed his sense of humor when Barry(""Tony"")said, ""Riley, Stern, & Starr ... sounds like a lawfirm"" - haha!It's a wonderful movie but I have to admit that I avoid watchingthe ending of this movie cause it's terribly sad. I only go as far watching the movie of the part when Tony rescues Lola, takes her back to New York with him & marries her. After the wedding scene, I don't watch the rest of the movie cause Rico should've been the one to have gotten killed by that gunshot, not Tony!!"
4,Delightfully perverse bit of camp fun,"Imagine if you will, an old 20th Century Fox musical; one starring, say, John Payne, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche wherein 2 young performers fall in love, seek stardom, have a falling out, but finally get together for a happy ending.All accompanied by a typical, i.e. better-than-average but just short of memorable, song score. Then, at the end, Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" enters and utters ""Say Hallo to my li'l fren'"" That's this film (and, no, I'm not giving anything away, that's the song,too!)Add to this a script by JAMES LIPTON! Yes, ""Actor's Studio"" James Lipton!(Is ""Manilow"" his least or most favorite word?)and you've got a unique treat."
2,Not quite!,"It was with great excitement that I bought this DVD and couldn't wait to sit down and watch. Twenty minutes into it I thought to myself, ""just give it time, I'm sure it'll pick up!!"" Well I was thinking that all the way to the credits!! If you want the stage show, then this is not the one to get. But if it's glorious 80's kitch and some nice Manilow tunes thrown into a rather tedious story, mediocre acting and singing that you want, well then this will hit the spot! Not a great DVD, but a nice souvenir of a past era!"
5,The best of mongo.,"We can talk about latin jazz, or afro cuban music, percussion, or just latin music, and in the conversation, we have to mention Mongo Santamaría.This is one of the finest musicians of latin jazz. his influence is everywere. This cd is a compilation of all the stages in his career. You have to have it. There's nothing more to say."
5,Prevention/Diagnosis of an Abuser,"Looking back on my Sociology class in college, I have discovered that this would have been a GREAT resource book to accompany my text. The author has organized an ideal characterization of an abuser and his victim. Perhaps through reading this book, many potential dependent women will become independent and their eyes will be open to the factors contributing to being physically, mentally, and or sexually abused. There are wonderful charts and diagrams (Venn) regarding the mental and physical factors of the abuser and the victim. The author has done a very good job in identifying the ""cycle"" of abuse. So many victims have closed their eyes to what they know as reality and choose to believe what is false. The section on ""The cycle of abuse"" was very informative. In closing, this was an informative, eye-opening reality check that must be read by all."
1,still havent received my book,"i ordered my book before xmas . its been over one month and still no book. no refund either. its been so long, i dont even care if it comes or not."
4,Morse : Remorseful Day set,"Great for those who enjoy an intellectual murder mystery, particularly labyrinthine in plot; makes for good repeat viewing. I am working my way through the entire series on DVD, and am delighted to view many which were not televised on PBS. Ordered the last in the series first, as I thought they would be the most ""modern"" in setting and references .... a caveat to viewers of this set that took me by surprise SPOILERS AHEAD: there are extended sessions dealing with Morse's health issues, and painstaking detail as to his care, sometimes at cost of the mystery narrative thread (too much time spent with his hospital stay and less time solving the ""crime""); that was a minor diasppointment for me. So, I've now ordered the earliest episodes, and will continue in sequence.Inspector Morse: Remorseful Day - Collection Set"
3,Good for reference,"This is an excellent reference work, though, as a text is is inadequate. I found that several of the answers in the back are incorrect and often the practice questions rely too much ""refer to problem 8-16."" The explanations are somewhat hard to follow as is the practice of placing figures some distance away from the related text. This is a Wiley book so it is over-priced, but what are you going to do?"
2,Average video on ADHD,"This is ADHD 101. If you're already diagnosed don't bother. If your gathering information for your kids, don't bother. If you've never heard of the term ADHD before then this sensationalistic, overly dramatic video is not a bad introduction. I think it gave a couple of key examples of problems ADHD types deal with: collapse of time, as well as a decent description of the 3 main subtypes. So if your brand new to this subject its a good beginning. If your looking for more depth, check out Misunderstood Minds."
3,Decent Item,"I can fit all of my camping cookware in this bag, including 2 propane bottles. Great for a jumble of camping supplies. However I was a little disappointed in the designing of the side walls. The picture fools you. It looks like it has some sort of stiff siding, but it collapses without anything it it. I would kind of prefer something more like a lunch bags siding material. You know how they stand up by themselves. Just a small preference, but otherwise a decent bag."
3,"Holds everything, and possibly the kitchen sink!!!","The Coleman Camper's storage tote is handy, but bulky. We packed pretty much all of our kitchen gear into this bag aside from the kitchen sink (unless your going to count the portable wash basin) and we still had room for more. This tote is a great price for as big as it is, but as others have said unless you pack it full it wont stand up by itself. Also because of the large ""pocket"", organization is out. The bottom storage area fits the stove nicely, but to get the stove out if you are not unpacking it, it's quite a chore.... and last but not least, if your going to pack it full make sure you don't have to carry it far!!!"
2,Horrible design...,"I was given this tote as a gift from a wedding registry. I admit when i first seeked the bag out I was very happy with reviews that I had read about it. Having used it once i realze that this bag is not for me. Contrary to many pictures that I found of the bag the sides of the bag are not hard sided making this bag somewhat hard to pack and stack things on top of. I lower compartment is great for the Coleman stove and was one of the main reasons I wanted the bag, but if you do not have one of the largest models of stove it leaves a lot of extra room in the lower compartment. Do not be fooled as I was of this bag. I would much prefer a large tupperware tub than this peice of camping equipment."
5,W-O-W !,This controversial book is a gem: you'll rediscover the people that made the 20th century in a way you never expected to see them! The illustrations by Guy Peellaert ar truly fabulous and the texts by english writer Nik Cohn match perfectly with them. A must-have!
5,Great item!!,"Was as described, got item quickly. Installed in just a few minutes. I would reccommend this buyer to any one."
5,great movie.,WHEN???????? WHAT IS TAKING SOOOOOOOOO LONG TO RELEASE THIS MOVIE. PLEASE SOMETIME BEFORE WE HAVE A MELTDOWN.
4,Sentimental family classic.,"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes is a sentimental family drama along the lines of The Human Comedy, I Remember Mama, My Girl, etc. Young farm girl Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me In St. Louis, The Secret Garden) learns lessons of life from her father (Edward G. Robinson), teacher (Frances Gifford), and small town newspaper editor (James Craig). The cast includes Agnes Moorehead (Bewitched), Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins (The Human Comedy, National Velvet), and Charles Middleton, who played Ming The Merciless in the Flash Gordon serials."
2,Our Vines have tender grapes,Yikes! someone cut their heads off in many of the scenes.Potsdam Senior
5,Is this the complete uncut version,"I have enjoyed this movie since my childhood. However, when it is shown on television one of the most important parts is left out. That is when Arnold first sees Judge Henderson and is completely overwhelmed by the judges prescence. There are several comic referrals to Judge Henderson throughout the movie. Taking out the sequence in which the Judge appears greatly diminishes the fun. If we are not given the chance to see Judge Henderson, how are we to appreciate the humor? A Fan in Chicago"
5,Everyone should see this movie.,"This is one of the great movies of all time. If tears do not come to your eyes in this movie, then there is something wrong with you. Edward G. Robinson plays an entirely different type in this movie. Margaret O'Brian and Butch Jenkins are wonderful. If you like this movie, then you will really love ""The Human Comedy."""
5,sweet father daughter relationship,"a beautiful family story-- reminded us of why we loved the movie. ""I Remember Mama"" - just straight up good story telling"
5,Super oldie/weenie,"This is a super old weepie which I first saw several decades ago.They could actually act in these days.It's just a nice Sunday afternoon's story for the whole family, and Edward G Robinson and the little girl are great. He is not a baddie (I.e. not a hard cop or a gangster.).Enjoy it.Jim Mercer"
2,"Informative, but confusing","I got this book planning to pass this exam as the last elective for my 4.0 track MCSE. This book assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of the Windows 2000 environment, and does not explain any of these concepts to you. If you already know Win2K well, this book might help you, but as for me - I'm going with the Exam Prep (from Exam Cram)."
2,This is not a good product,I guess its okay for the discounted price. The pieces are very light and the assembly design is atrocious. The screws don't fit tightly. The final product looks good but is very frail and won't survive a move.I would not recommend this product.
4,Excellent Moral Story,"Almost finished reading this book and it was a real page turner! Although it takes place in the 50's, I did not really have the feeling I get with most historial fiction. There were few references to current events, fashions, etc, that would give the reader the sense of that time frame. This is the only drawback to the novel and if you are a historical fiction fan (as I am) you might be a little disappointed. For that reason I gave the book four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it turned out to be a really great story!"
3,Review for the Game,"I remembered watching this when it first came out in 1996. As I began watching this a week or so ago I couldn't quite remember how it went exactly and I was taken again on the same twisted mental journey as I did on my first viewing That is what I would have to say of this movie, you are taken on a twisted mental jounney. At this films ending came again the chance to breathe."
4,shoplady55,"This curling iron is great for medium length hair and I might add a very hard size to find in stores. At on time a beauty supply store carried it but no more, I was very happy to find it at on Amazon, hope it is carried for a long time."
3,Commands attention,"Name any world figure or celebrity superstar, and Andy Kaufman could have upstaged him. What a shame the Lord took him so young, but I, for one, don't argue with God. I wonder where Andy would have gone with his career. Anyway, see MY BREAKFAST WITH BLASSIE. While not as funny as some of Kaufman's work, the film certainly does what the late artist did best: command undivided attention."
4,"""Classy"" Fred Blassie the Brilliant","An absolutely essential picture for any fan of professional wrestling. Andy Kaufman was never much of wrestler (what kind of a man fights girls only to lose?) True, the film starts a bit slowly, but the pace builds in an elegant way, to its finish, a finish that is not expected. ""Classy"" Fred Blassie - the man who added ""pencil-neck geek"" to our lexicon - is at his offensive best here. He is a tie to the Golden Age of Wrestling, before Hulk Hogan and the other latecomers. Whether it is puerile comments about ""broads"", or demonstrating the fine points of using a pre-moistened towelette, Blassie is a master to see at work. I took my girlfriend, not a wrestling fan, to see this picture, with no explanation. She laughed until her sides hurt. On my next movie night i paln to shoe ""My Dinner With Andre"" before the meal, and ""My Breakfast With Blassie"" afterwards. Why, O why couldn't Wallace Shawn do some work with Fred Blassie?"
3,a very strange film,"I wouldn't recomend this film to someone who's not pretty familiar with Andy Kaufman's style.Basically Kaufman and ex pro wrestler: Fred Blassie sit down at Denny's in LA(Sambo's then) and talk about wrestling,Washing and shaking hands,and girls.The greatest thing is the beginning of the film there's footage of Andy Kaufman at the premiere party sporting a mowhawk and a leather jacket.I'd love to see all of the premiere party.-Eric"
1,Not this KAUFMAN Guy Again - Bive me a break...,"Kaufman and Blassie - BIG DEAL.This movie has no plot and makes no sense.Probably as bad as that ""Moonman"" movie that's coming out this fall. I can't believe they're makin' a movie about Kaufman and not about me!"
2,I was expecting it to be good!,It was great to see more of the real Andy Kaufman but this movie was kind of boring. This movie was kind of like The Truman Show except that movie was better than this. I don't know why Andy had to be in this film. It was 60 minutes and it was dumb. Don't waste your time on this movie. Man on the Moon was a better biography except the real Andy Kaufman is not in it. Jim Carrey plays him. Stick with Man on the Moon. This movie was really slow. Don't even plan on seeing it.
4,What the heck was that?,"I picked up this video after reading Bob Zmuda's ""Andy Kaufman Revealed"". If you've read the book you get the humor in this video. If your a true Kaufman fan you get the humor in this video. If you watched ""Taxi"" and ""Man on the Moon"" and laughed at the goofy characters at the end of ""Breakfast With Blassie"" you'll be left saying what the heck was that? It's worth having in your Kaufman collection"
3,Very original creative unusual comedy.,We all have met someone like Fred Blassie before. His breakfast with Andy Kaufman will have you hysterical with so much off the wall humor. Is this film real or staged? Its hard to tell with these two guys. The memory of the film will have you recollecting and laughing for days after.
3,"No ""Innkeepers""!","If you look carefully, you'll see that some episodes are missing, including my favorite, ""The Inkeepers"" (#23)! Is this a cheap way to force us to buy the DVDs? I was thrilled to see that Frasier is available for streaming, but I wish Amazon hadn't cheated us!"
2,Each Episode Has To Be Played Individually,"But that wasn't the worst part. I've once again gotten a bad DVD from Amazon, one that I believe is probably used but sold as new. The episode ""Matchmaker"" doesn't even play. When selected, I'm taken to a menu of other things on the DVD. I tried watching other episode and going back to Matchmaker, but it's the same thing every time. I've never seen anything like it! I make sure the dot to select episodes is right next to Matchmaker, and yet I'm taken to a menu instead of it playing. Haven't gotten through the entire second season yet, but have asked for a refund and will return the entire thing to Amazon... so they can sell it to someone else?"
3,a little less sugar please.,"In this season there are some great classic episodes including classic scenes with Bulldog, Gil and Bibi. There are also a few off-timed moments and Frasier's character is too bombastic; Kelsey Grammar over-acts. Unfortunately the radio show cast are also badly directed and the awkwardness is evident."
3,funnier than seinfeld,"Apparantly this show was on for 11 years and won 31 emmy's or oscar's or i forget what, so it'd be hard to say that it was overlooked, but I never paid attention to it until the end of the series and I missed out. The special features are stupid as all hell (dating tips especially) but the episodes are the reason people buy the stuff. Notable ones are The unkindest cut (disc 1), the club (disc 3), fool me once shame on you fool me twice (disc 3) and the matchmaker (disc 1).There's an episode where Frasier continues to insist that men in general are trustworthy and then he gets betrayed. And there's one where he takes a call from a guy who's afraid to use the phone (that's at the beginning of the club). And there's an episode about confused sexuality. It's funny. Most spin-off's of tv shows don't work, but this spin-off of Cheers definitely did."
1,Incompatible,"The recording you sent me was not usable in United Kingdom, so I returned it and you refunded the purchase price."
2,NOT IN A BOX,"This was intended to be a gift, so I thought I was going to get the complete season in a nice boxed set... Nope! All the discs came in ONE, regular, plastic holder. Very disappointed! The product description even says ""boxed set!"" I don't know what I'm supposed to do now that the party is in 2 days!"
5,Frasier - The Complete Second Season,I got this for my seventeen year old daughter because she is a fan. She loves it. With so much drama in a teenagers life these days it nice to hear laughter.
2,Not a box set,"I bought this season new thinking it would come in a box set like all the other seasons but it came in a regular single DVD case instead. It does have all the disks, its just in a smaller case. A little disappointing but other than that there was nothing wrong with it."
5,Frasier Fan,"Started watching Frasier after seeing ""Daphne's Room"" episode 2 years ago, after laughing uncontrollably, I was hooked on the series. I had heard great reviews as well as how refreshing, witty, and hilarious the show is, in addition to being a multi-Emmy winner.I think Season 2 is the best of the series. I did not enjoy the final season as much as the earlier seasons."
4,Season 2 may be the best Frasier season,"The complete second season may be the best season of the show. All shows are witty and develop the characters more deeply. ""Flour Baby"" may be the funniest episode of all time."
1,Total Rip Off,"First of all, the picture for this item on Amazon is incorrect. Pictured is a much smaller light.Second, this light is INSULTINGLY dim for the price. It barely lights up the top of whatever you hang it above, despite taking a ridiculous amount of C batteries.The neck is loose and shoddy right out of the box, even after tightening.For the price, this is a criminally poor quality item. Complete waste of money."
4,Wonderful book.,"I am really enjoying using this book daily. Too bad that it appears to be out of print, so it can be difficult to get a nice, clean copy."
1,TERRIBLE ITEM,"This is a total rip off, when they say it fits in the palm of your hand-they mean a peanut can fit in your hand, and the eggsercizer may just as well be that big. I would not try to buy anything from these people because I tried to return it with no hard feelings (no bad comments) but instead they refused and asked for this review. Please do not purchase anything from these rip-off artists."
3,"Get A James Burton, Hank Marvin or Hendrix Compilation first","Greatest guitarist on the planet? Gatton, God rest his soul, is a damn good player; but he suffers from a severe case of Roy Buchanan clone disease. Great technical playing, but nothing original. I found myself fast forwarding one track after another until I found something that really rocked, twanged or jammed.Most of the previous reviews were obviously written by Danny Gatton fans. I am a guitar fan, and I know my guitar. I strongly suggest investigating music featuring the guitar of James Burton or Hank Marvin. Then work your way thru Duanne Eddy, Link Wray or The Ventures. Then get the Roy Buchanan Anthology.Some Danny Gatton albums are highly collectable and pricey. But if you can find his album ""Relentless"" with Joey De Francesco, buy that first."
5,The Telemaster will live forever,"The first time I saw and heard Danny Gatton live, I literally got the feeling that I was going to live forever. The skies parted and a geat light energy came down through his fingers and the wood and steel of his Tele. Everything was magic. A truely special person, and I miss him. Buy a Danny Gatton disc, any one."
4,Excellent album,"I bought Nighttime Calls along with Little Things.This is another great album by Sylver.My favourite tracks on this album are:Love Is An Angel, Summer Solstice, Who Am I, Make It, Tomorrow, and Don't Call Me.I wish that they had bonus remixes of Love Is An Angel & Make It on here.Great trance/dance album! Keep it up Sylver!"
2,sorry i bought it,purchased this and thought i would be happypretty weakbetter off with dj encore or kate ryantheir last cd was much betterthis one just drones on and on
1,EXTREMLY MISLEADING BUNK...,"This film is displayed as UNRATED which would give most citizens the idea that were purchasing a x-rated flick. This is not true as if you look at the cover it says it is the EDITED VERSION, which means all the juicy scenes(x-rated) are edited out... sexy babes etc yes... but you end up seeing a chopped up version of a no doubt decent film... anything with Sandra Irons in it has to be... but man!! really!! why can't companies properly display there products!!, now I have to send this bloody version back because it's more or less a late night tv show... Great film sure... but get the juicy version.. this isn't it....L. CooperNova Scotia, CANADA"
3,Good collection of mediocre movies,"I purchased this item because I wanted the movie ""Zero Hour,"" the serious movie that much of ""Airplane"" was based on. As it turned out, it was cheaper at the time to buy this set of three movies instead of just ""Zero Hour"" by itself. ""Zero Hour"" is a great movie to watch if you like ""Airplane,"" and it's a fairly good movie in its own right. The other two movies are less interesting, but not bad."
1,Did not like too well,"I needed to study this book for a class I was taking. I have to admit...I didn't like it too well and had a hard time getting through it. There WERE a few points I picked up on, however so it was not a total loss."
3,Comfortable.,"This was actually purchased for someone else. It was found to be comfortable, but not sure it helped in this situation."
3,Getting there,"After living with this thing for 3 weeks, I'm finally getting used to it. If you can find a soft version of it however I'd suggest that. The soft ones a what I had previously experienced ( it seems) at my chiropractors office and it was great! This one is much more firm than the ones he has in his office. It still works great in reducing many of my aches & pains but I find myself switching between it & my feather pillows throughout the night many evenings."
2,Made me feel suffocated,"Pretty much every night I could not fall asleep due to this pillow- on my side I felt like I couldnt breath and on my back, my neck would ache so much. I really tried to get used to it and to like it, but after 2 weeks I could not afford to lose the sleep anymore. It now is a great kitty pillow."
4,Tri-core Pillow,"It doesn't give me the total support I was looking for. It's a very hard pillow, if I use the outer edge for side sleeping support. I sometimes wake up with neck aches that I didn't ever have before with a regular pillow."
5,Less Pain in one night!,"It is not the most comfortable pillow in the beginning, but with a neck or upper back injury, it really can help take away pain and allow muscles in the area to heal- I tried not sleeping on it for a couple nights, and my neck pain got worse and worse- then I went back to it, and was instantly better the next day! Great product!"
5,Sleepy,Great product. Was a bit skeptical of the low price. It made sleeping a little more enjoyable. Hope this review helps you.General
2,Way too low in the middle,"I find that the triangle in the middle is way too low. There is NO stuffing in the triangle, so you feel like you are sleeping in a fluffy bowl. I have tried to stuff something in the middle, but it never stays put and is lumpy and uncomfortable. For me, the middle should have a little fluff to make this pillow workable."
2,"Nice pillow, just not for me","I ordered this pillow hoping that it would help me to comfortably sleep on my back. After reading other reviews, it seemed like a good choice for me. However, when I used it the night it arrived, I woke to terrible neck pain. I found the area between the edge of the pillow and the concaved area for the head, to be too long. My neck was being stretched to fit into the pillow correctly. Since this is my individual experience, and had probably more to do with my anatomy, I would still recommend the pillow. The quality was good and perhaps for a taller or larger person, the fit would be perfect. It is a stiff pillow, definitely on the extra firm side."
2,Depends on how you sleep,"It is a good firm pillow, but only if you sleep on your back. If you roll onto your side like I do in the middle of the night, the design seem to fold in my face."
5,Gentle Support -Orthopedic Pillow By Chattanooga,"Five years ago my C4 vertebrae was fractured and collapsed, had a C3-C5 cervical fusion and now have plates, wires, and screws anterior and posterior in my neck for life. Needless to say I've tried just about every pillow that will give me proper cervical support. I would recommend this pillow but it does take some time to get accustomed and you have to follow the instructions. I'm a side sleeper and for proper support you really need to sleep on either end (learned this the hard way). If you sleep on your back then use the center. Sometimes I lay on my back with this pillow and can actually hear my neck aligning. I've had this product for about 2 weeks and wake up with no headache, neck or shoulder pain, YAY! I still have to put a pillow underneath this one when sleeping because it's to low for me but it does work. Thanks to the chiropractor who submitted his review."
3,"It's OK, not worth the price",I bought it over a year ago and have been sleeping on it on and off since then. It is just a normal pillow material that is sown into that shape; nothing fancy.Would I buy it again? NO.
2,caused more neck pain,"Saw this while trying to find pillow to support my arthritic neck and thought ""A HA!!!"" Very disappointed when tried it; I gave it a month to see if my muscles could adapt...no way! I'm a back sleeper and I can't get my head into the hollow without having to get my shoulders on top of the side supports and thats very uncomfortable and eventually they slip off the sides and my neck is bent forward. The neck supports for back sleepers are just TOO WIDE and I am 5'7"".I've been thinking of doing some ""surgery"" on this and make the neck supports thinner so I can use this without having to strain my shoulders and neck. That's a lot of work and may not be possible so my search for a good neck support pillow continues."
1,neck support pillow,The pillow was much too large for me. They would not allow me to return it. It shouldhave been clearly stated that they would not take a return before I purchased. I wouldnot have bought it.
5,Cured morning headaches,"I was waking up every other day with a stiff neck and headache. Not anymore, thanks to this pillow!It takes some getting used to, but it's not difficult. This pillow is great!"
5,"No pain, no gain","First use, woke up with neck pain. Not the usual pain, but neck still hurt when I woke up.Second day, pain faded to a whimper. After second day, no pain. I got a more restful sleep & my neck had side-to-side movement that's it never had. I can turn my head over my left shoulder now.Read the instructions to ensure you're using the pillow as intended."
3,Not for side sleepers,"This does seem like a fine pillow for back sleepers, but it is absolutely silly to say that it is good for side sleepers.Maybe this should have been obvious from the pictures, but the only way a side sleeper can use this pillow is to keep his head on the edges of the pillow. If you roll over, you need to move all the way to the other side of the pillow.Who sleeps like that?"
4,Takes a while to get used to,The quality of this pillow is great. It helps keep my neck in a proper position while sleeping. My neck is a lot less stiff when I wake up in the morning. My range of motion when turning my neck is way better than it was with a regular pillow.The only problem is that it takes a while to get used to sleeping with it. I'm always tempted to grab my old pillow because I miss the soft cushy feel of a normal pillow. It also seems to take longer to fall asleep because I'm not as comfortable.
5,good pillow,"It took about a week to get use to it, the pillow pulled the head away from the shoulders slightly and now I have far less neck pain in the morning."
5,Less trips to the chiropractor needed,"A violinist/violist with long-standing (like 25 years) neck/shoulder issues: This pillow has made a huge difference, all for the better! I bought one for a pianist friend, and she loves it. I'm now buying one for a kayaking buddy. I highly recommend this pillow."
5,Cant live with out this pillow!!!,"I have been getting this pillow for few years now and I can't live without it. I used to have to go to a massage therapist for my neck and shoulders. Since I was introduced to this pillow, I don't need to go anymore. It just supports your head perferctly. I'm hard on pillows and I get a new one every 6 months, other pillows, I was replacing every every other month. I highly recommend it. Sweet dreams!"
4,Great Pillow,"I bought this pillow for my boyfriend who has blown disks in his neck. He sleeps much more comfortably, has little to no pain in the mornings, and he feels well rested now. We want to recommend this product. It is well worth the money (which is much cheaper than the chiropracter charges)."
2,Very uncomfortable for both myself and my husband,"I got this for my husband for his stiff neck and snoring. He gave it to me after a couple nights because it was so uncomfortable for him and yes he still snored. It is very thick and stiff. It might work for some people who spend all night laying flat on their back, but I don't see how it could work for a smaller person like myself at all. Plus if you like to sleep on your side sometimes there is no way this will work, its extremely uncomfortable."
5,"Neck and shoulder pain GONE, eventho still commuting/computing!","Before owning this pillow for nearly 1 year now, I tried all the usual therapeutic, buck wheat, natural form, neck roll, neckbone, microfoam pillows, and on and on....Finally, after just the first few nights, my neck pain and upper shoulder pain was eliminated...My pain, I believe was attributed to desk/computer work, and a 1.5 hour daily commute (which I still do).The success of this pillow is due to your neck being supported properly without your head or shoulders angling up, rather your head aligns with the rest of your body. Plus, it's not too hard or too soft, and easy for back or side sleeping.The pillow alone is super comfortable...If you want added support for your side sleeping, somewhere to put your arms and shoulders for support, as well as between your knees, opt for the Sleep Number body pillow.Well worth the investment, and the price can't be beat (believe me, after spending hundreds on others that didn't work)."
4,Uncomfortable at First,It's uncomfortable at first and definitely takes some getting used to. I have less problems with my neck and don't wake up in pain. I don't recommend it for those who sleep on their sides. I often used it sleeping on one side of the pillow and now I have a jaw problem. One side of my jaw pops all the time and it's irritating and hard to get rid of. Only sleep on your back when using this pillow.
2,not helpful for side sleeping,"This pillow made me leave my side position and keep rolling onto my back. So, it's great for back sleepers. For side-sleeping, the neck support was too big (either side of the pillow) to get your neck comfortably over it and head down into the nook."
5,Pretty Happy,So far I've only used it when my neck was hurting and even using it one night seemed to really help. I may have to try using it every night! I would have to say that it's more comfortable using it if you are a back sleeper as opposed to a side sleeping position. I chose the gentle support based on another reviewer's recommendation and happy I did!
4,Hard to sleep without it,"This extra firm pillow is great for someone who sleeps on their side. I tend to fold my flimsy pillow in half but I don't need to with this pillow. Plus, it doubles as a neck roll when you're on your back. It's been great!My boyfriend, on the other hand, can't stand it. He's not used to the firmness and curves."
3,"Feels Nice, But Not Sure About the Quality","I got this at the advice of my massotherapist since I have no curve in my neck. It felt pretty good after the first night, but now (less than 1 week later) there is a separation in the foam filling right exactly where I place my neck. As if the weight of my head (ok, I've been told it is very heavy!) is splitting it into two sections. I do not like this, since, that is where I need the most support. Anyone else have this issue?"
4,Great for back-sleepers,"This pillow took me a little getting used to, about a week, but it is very supportive for back-sleepers. I didn't find it as comfortable for side-sleeping, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five."
3,"Ok, but not firm enough",This pillow is just OK. The edge is too soft to really support my neck. I will be looking for another one soon.
5,Best Neck Support,"After the first night of use I awoke without neck or back pain! I'm very happy with the comfort and contours, unlike my old curve and wedge pillows. The design lets me turn with ease from my back onto my side and over to the other side. A great comfy sleep. I will absolutely buy this again"
2,Comfort!,"I have tried sleeping on this pillow for numerous nights, and still find it very uncomfortable. I understand it takes some time to get used to, but just how long before I can get a good night's sleep...painlessly???"
1,Not comfortable at all!,Ordered this pillow because I have neck problems. Seemed to be fine for the first week or 2.. so I ordered another to have at our cabin..should have waited! The fill in the part of the pillow that supports your neck is separating/splitting in half on bothsides/ends of pillow. Also if I slept on my side the pillows makes my ear hurt & wakes me up constantly through the night & is quite painful. Pillow is lumpy not filled correctly or evenly. Can't return because I removed the plastic bag on both so I could sleep on it.. I am very disappointed with this pillow. I did see others have complained about the same issue's that I have had..should have read the reviews. My bad!
1,Not good,I thought I would like this pillow but It seems to only be useful for back sleepers. I tried sleeping on my back with it but it tilted my head too far back and that caused me to snore. I tried sleeping on my side with it and it just wasn't comfortable. My husband tried it too and he didn't like it either so I gave it to good will.
3,A bit too firm,"I bought this after having pulled a muscle in my neck after reading reviews. While the support it provides is great, it is REALLY firm and wasn't as comfortable for me (a back sleeper) as I had hoped it would be."
3,"I didn't like it, but my cat LOVE it!",I bought this pillow because my chiropractor recommended it. I'm not a fan of the pillow cause I'm more of a side sleeper. I know they say you can use it being a side sleeper but I felt like there was no room for my head. Not very comfy. My cats on the other hand.....LOVE this pillow. It is sitting on my couch with a pillow case on it..they love sleeping on it with the little hole or dip in the middle and fight over it constantly. I debated buying a second one...for them...not me.
3,pillow,This pillow works good when I am sleeping on my side. I have not gotten used to when on my back yet. It is rather flat.
3,neck relief?,"I like the size of this pillow,but the core isn't big enough for my head to be comfortable. Maybe it is meant for smaller people. I've had others I like better."
3,Not for everyone.,"I had a neck sprain and realized it was time to care about my neck, so among other things I bought this.It arrived fine, and looked promising, but there's a breaking in period. It's uncomfortable at the start, and still has been for a month now. It's better now than before, but it's not like I lay down on it and think, ""wow I'm comfortable"".Also, it's starting to get flat already, sigh, but all pillows do that.I won't be replacing it, but I still give it a lukewarm recommendation. I believe it helped me heal my neck sprain faster than usual, and I believe it is helping fix my too straight neck."
3,Should be marked thick!,"I have owned tri-core pillows before, and this is the THICK one, not the standard! It's still a great pillow, but I had to wear down one side to be able to use it."
2,Too big!,"I purchased this pillow based on the good reviews and my desperation for a good nights sleep. Unfortunately, this pillow was not for me. I would have been willing to deal with a transitional period, but the pillow was too large for my neck, no way I could have slept with it. I'm 5'4"" and of average weight. Too bad, seems like many people have great luck with it. Luckily I left the plastic on so I was able to return it for a refund (less the shipping fees)."
1,"Nice idea, however...","Got this pillow and tried sleeping with it for a week, but could not make it a full week. It looked like and had reviews of a good pillow but the hole in the middle proved to be impossible to sleep with unless you are a back sleeper. I sleep on my side/stomach and could not make this work."
2,Not For Me,"We sell this pillow in the practice I work in, and it's suppose to keep one's spine aligned, especially the cervical spine. So, I bought the pillow, and now I wish I hadn't. Personally, I think the dip in the middle, no matter what side I lay on, is too deep for me, and it causes me more neck pain that I had before. I'm a side sleeper and the pillow is not conducive to my side sleeping. ... My advice for anyone interested in this particular pillow, is: ""Try before you buy!"""
1,very lumpy pillow,"This pillow is very big, and very lumpy..if you roll to the side you must lift your head up to the huge overstuffed side. This is very hard to deal with during the night.stay on your back, the hole for your head is massive. It is not a pillow you could take with you, it is way to big and heavy. I can not use it at all, to return it, you pay shipping, very expensive because of the size and weight, you cant afford to return it..thought maybe my dogs would use it, they wont either as it has a huge hole in the middle for your head, then built up sides...a total waste of money"
3,too hard,It is too hard for a side sleeper. I wake up with my ear hurting. Good if you are a back sleeper.
2,cervical pillow,"I am one of the rare reviewers that did not get pain relief from this pillow. I have an arthritic neck and and have not found any pillow to reduce my neck pain. That said, this is a nice pillow and would be wonderful if it made my neck feel better."
4,AWESOME Pillow,I have two herniated disks in my neck. I saw this on Dr. Oz's show. Started using the pillow the day I received it and i have slept terrific for the last few days. I am not waking up with any pain or numbness in my left arm!!
1,Tried it and Can't Return It,Be sure to read the return policy before purchasing. Once the plastic is off the pillow you are unable to return it even if you will never use it again. How do you try it completely without taking off the plastic? I was unable to sleep after trying the pillow twice and now I am stuck with it.
4,"Pretty good, but not great","This pillow is good, and the shape does give you support. I sleep a lot on my side, and I feel the pillow lacks a little space on both sides for this to be very comfortable.The material used inside the pillow is not overly comfortable, but it does provide support (which I guess is a little more important than comfort).Overall I am happy with this pillow, as I am no longer waking up with my neck out of whack."
2,Had to return it.,"I bought the gentle support after reading reviews here and have found it to be very soft after 2 weeks. Overall it could be a little firmer, but I am happy and the price was right.UPDATE : I had to return this pillow as it lost a lot of its loft after a month."
2,too big for me?,"Everyone who keeps writing that it's hard to tell if a pillow is right for you until you try it, now I get what they mean. Where this pillow shape is a great idea, I haven't been able to get used to it and I believe it's just too big for my neck. My neck isn't long enough to reach down into the center section, and I feel like my head is way too high while I'm on my back. (I'm 5'5"" and 120 lbs female). Also, I couldn't imagine a pillow as firm as people were describing, but yes -- it's pretty darn hard. I'm still trying to get used to it, but I don't have high hopes. The concept is exactly what I am looking for, though, so I'll likely try the smaller version or the softer version . . not sure which one I need . . ."
2,Tri-Core Pillow Gentle Support not the best,"I thought this pillow was just not good for me because I am short in stature. My head only reached the neck support so I would have to bunch it up and then it was uncomfortable on my neck. I then let a taller friend try it but she said it was too hard on her neck. Evidently, not a good pillow for either the short or tall."
1,Made neck pain worse,"I purchased this pillow because I'd been having severe neck pain and couldn't move my head without shooting pain going from my neck into my head. I used the pillow for two nights and the neck pain worsened. I followed the directions on how to use the pillow, so I'm not sure what went wrong for me. It seems as though this pillow helped a lot of people with neck pain. Maybe it just doesn't work on some people or with certain types of beds. Anyway, I went back to a normal pillow and my neck pain slowly went away over the next week."
1,Do not recommend,"I used the pillow enthusiastically, but ended up with a neck pain. It is not soft enough and to me the pillow is too thick. Would not recommend this pillow.."
5,praise for pillow,"http://www.amazon.com/Tri-Core-Orthopedic-Standard-Support-Pillow/dp/B000ET9TXQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1232815877&sr;=1-1I have neck problems, and I found this pillow to be great. I am a back sleeper, but was able to find proper support when I turned my head to the side. My two teenage nephews are fighting over it. Their mother tells me they love it, as well. I have bought another one."
2,THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN CHANGED,"I have been using, and loving, this product for many years. It was first recommended by my chiropractor. I just reordered and find that the product has changed for the worse. It no longer has the firm support it once gave me. I phoned customer support and they confirmed that the pillow was now made softer, they also admitted to many complaints from older customers like me.My neck pain has returned and I am trying to find a good replacement product. It truly is a pity when a firm takes a proven winner and tinkers with it. I doubt that they will have many repeat customers with this new product.It reminds me of when the Coca Cola folks discontinued their proven formula and changed the soda. Public uproar made them produce Classic Coke. Maybe Core Products will wake up too."
4,Good Pillow,I found this pillow to greatly reduce my neck pain. When sleeping on side it did make my ear sore. Also this pillow only lasted 6 months before becoming deformed.
5,Cant sleep without it,Chiropractor gave me one to try years ago. I sleep bad. I have to replace every year or else I have problems. It isnt the most comfortable pillow until you get use to it. Cant live without it.
5,Tri-core Pillow Firm,"I have used Core Products Tri-Core pillows for many years. This firm pillow supports my neck throughout the night, very comfortable to sleep on sides and back."
3,Back sleeping,I enjoy the pillow for back sleeping but not for side sleeping. The pillow felt too full for me to comfortably side sleep. I have a straight neck instead of the normal curvature and have also had one neck surgery.
2,May help if you like EXTRA FIRM,I have a reverse curve in my neck and herniated discs. I couldn't use this pillow for longer than a few minutes. I am hoping to return it and find something else.
1,Tri-core Cervical Pillow,This pillow did not help my problem with my neck at all and being a side sleeper was not usable for me. If you sleep on your back a lot it might be helpful.
5,Finally slept through the night,"I was having difficulty sleeping through the night due to uncomfortable pillows. I tried an expensive down pillow and various other ones, but they just didn't do the trick. The first night I tried this one I slept through the night."
3,not bad,Bought this pillow based on the assumption that this would help with my neck. The pillow is not all the seller claims it to be..the next support breaks down. not supportive at all....better off rolling up a towel and laying that under my neck.
3,"Better sleep, sore neck","Ordered the pillow for my husband, who after 4 nights had to go back to his old pillow...it was too hard for him. So I tried it and like it...I don't toss and turn nor do I wake up in the night. The Standard support is a bit too hard for me also but because I'm sleeping thru the night I'm going to stick it out another week or so."
1,don't waste your money,not comfortable unless you sleep in ONE position all night. this pillow made my neck hurt more!
2,Tri-Core Pillow Gentle Support,"I am writing about the Tri-Core Pillow (Gentle Support). I am a side sleeper. The pillow information should emphasize that it is designed primarily for back sleepers. It is not very comfortable for side sleeping. There is only a small section of the pillow to rest one's head on if sleeping on the side.The pillow seems pretty comfortable if I lie on my back, but I have to avoid the back position when I sleep, in order to avoid snoring and to avoid a tendency for sleep apnea."
5,Great Pillow!,"Great pillow. Helped relieve most of my head aches and neck pain. Fits in a standard pillow case (everyone who says it doesn't must use tiny pillow cases). I would never go with anything but the gentle. If it was any more firm it would be uncomfortable. I slept deeply for the first time in months when I got it, and I recommend it to anyone who wakes up in the morning with a sore or stiff neck."
4,Very good pillow.,"After trying about 6 different pillows over the last couple of years, this has been the most comfortable for side or back sleeping for me. It's not perfect, but it supports my neck better than any other pillow."
4,Good but a little too thick,"I have herniated discs in my neck and never sleep well. I was advised to get this type of contour pillow so I did. I definitely understand the reason for this product and the importance of reinforcing the natural curve in the neck so I was eager to use it. The ""thinner"" contour on the pillow is a little too thick and OVER reinforces the natural curve but it feels better now after about 2 wks. You have to give it a chance and let your neck get used to the change of the pillow. I have less pain and sleep better so I would recommend it but really wish they would make thinner contours for those of us who have smaller necks."
1,Too Hard,This pillow was too hard and just didn't fit my neck. Could not fall asleep with this thing -- made my upper shoulders hurt also.
2,Not just for comfort,"I purchased this pillow as I get a lot of neck strains and pain... the usual look one way and it pulls..I'm on a computer all day.. etc... I thought it may be a comfortable option to have a ""better"" pillow that supports my neck..I found this pillow very uncomfortable and actually replaced with my old pillow on my first night trying it... Its now collecting dust..I understand that for people with serious neck injuries this may keep your head in place as to avoid pain or further injury..I won't doubt the science behind it..But for the daily sleeper looking to buy something random on amazon when their neck hurts... I don't recommend it..."
4,Great for back-sleeping.,"This pillow is wonderful for back sleeping. It allows you to sleep almost flat, while cradling your head and beautifully supporting your neck. It also allows your head some swivel room, but without letting your neck get too out of sync--really great for neck problems that keep ending up at the chiropractor's office (it has substantially reduced my visits). Only minus is that it's a bit hot in the summer, since the sides all come up around your head. This pillow is beautifully and sturdily made as well. Can't say it completely eliminates snoring but my bedmate is a lot less often bothered by my back-sleep snoring."
4,tricore pillow,Tricore pillow reallly helps me sleep better. Very comfortable and supports my head and neck. Definitely a good buy for you.
4,Correct Delivery,The item I ordered was delivered on informed day. Thank you very much.i hope it is able to be shipped to overseas.
3,stiff,"works good but not a pillow to use everynight. very firm. i bought 2 one for me and hubby, he will not use his at all."
3,Could have been better,"'Three Men In A Boat' is one of the funniest books ever written. However, from the film-maker's point of view, the trouble with the book is that it has very little plot. Three men decide to spend a fortnight on the Thames, rowing up from Kingston to Oxford and back again. They are invovled in various humorous incidents, and recall other incidents from past trips. And that's it.Disatisfied with this, the makers of this film version decided to give the book more of a plot by having them puruse a trio of pretty girls up the river. A few passages from the book are quite well done: getting lost in Hampton Court maze, getting the oblivious courting couple to tow their boat, trying to open the tin of pineapple. However, much of the humour of the book has been replaced by heavy-handed and not very funny facrical incidents with the three girls, culminating in a very tedious cricket match.A pity that the film-makers didn't have the courage to just film the book as it was."
3,Three Men In A Boat,"Reading Jerome K. Jerome's novel was one of the highlights of my literary life. I would rate the novel as the funniest book ever written. The movie tries and has a good cast, but just doesn't reach the levels of the book. Still, an enjoyable view... but read the book first."
5,Can't stop laughing,"One of the best German farces, ridiculously funny. It's our sons' favorite movie, their mother hates it because she grew up reading Karl May books (German analog of James Fennimore Cooper) and takes them seriously. The movie is, of course, a farce based on a May story. The scene where Santa Maria dances is worth the whole show, as is the end where one discovers the origin of 'Think Pink' .... .Maybe second best German farce: Vaya con Dios with Chiara Schoras, but it's unavailable in the U.S."
4,Correct meanings,Now I have an excellent tool to understand the correct meaning and the use of many phrasal verbs.
2,Invicta Reality,"The watch keeps great time as long as it does not sit for more than ten hours. If it does, the time will be way off."
4,Giant Heavy Duty Automatic,"This Invicta is a great watch if you are looking for a giant size timepiece with a touch of elegance. It is well designed and the fit and finish is good. The Citizen automatic movement is a workhorse and very reliable. When you open the box, this watch will impress you and everytime you wear it, it will be noticed. It is not for the timid. Comments and more information can be obtained through the www.invictawatchforum.com. See what others think and general watch information."
1,Not as what I expected,"I recently purchased the product, the item is really not what I expected: too big, too heavy, the instruction of setting date is not clear, the crown for setting date/time comes with two positions, difficult to confirm it is pushed back, too difficult to get the pin out of the link without tool, it should at least come with some basic toolkit as a whole product."
2,Great unless you have the yakima fairing,"Has to be reversed if you have the fairing, or the wheel tightener will not swing past it. They did not design it to work with one of their most common components. When it is flipped around the rack sticks out over my windshield. Plus I think it looks kind of stupid to have your bike backwards up there. The High Roller Rack has the tensioner knob behind the wheel, so this should not be a problem."
2,Potentially informative for the semi-colon impaired,"I liked the tutorial approach at first, but found the book frustratingly over-simplified for experienced developers who want to use the tool to test their UI before releasing to systems or SQA. Many topics are touched on, for example a nomencalature discipline (naming convention), but there is no appendix where you can see the recommended convention for naming each type of constant for your controls (e.g. BTN_ for naming buttons, MNU_ for menus, ...). It is hardly a bible or a desktop reference, simply an expanded tutorial. I got the book in the hopes that it would fill in the holes in the Rational documentation, but it doesn't."
5,Thorogood boots,"I wore redwing boots for 20years and they are expensive and hard to break in feet hurt for weeks , i saw the thorogood brand online and decided to try them price was cheaper , made in usa and they looked good. I tried them on and they felt great i wore them to work the next day , they are the most comfortable boot i ever had , no sore feet no break in ,i will never buy redwing again i am sticking with thorogood"
4,Great Boot but it runs 1 size to large,"I have worn a size 12 boot since 17 years old. I was swimming in these thorogoods. I have sent them back for an exchange. I will update once I receive the smaller size. Other than that they felt great and well built. This is the perfect summer boot for us Operating Engineers. Non insulated and fairly light.Oh by the way, Buy American made Union Made"
4,Thorogood boot,This is one of the best USA made work boots. It is hard to beat considering the price and quality. My only complaint is the inside toe area should be lined in leather instead of thin cotton. The cotton lining wears too quickly. I am wearing my second pair and would buy a third.
5,My husband loves them!,I picked these boots for my husband after reading reviews of all the other work boots out there. I wanted a product made in the US and these are from Wisconsin. He loves these boots and they fit really well. Shipped quickly as well.
4,Great American Made Boot,"This boot is everything that it's advertised to be...comfortable, good fit and American Made (resole-able) My last two pair of boots, made by Timberland, literally disintegrated!"
5,"So far, so GOOOOOD!","I just ordered these and have now worn them for 2 - count 'em: TWO - days. They are remarkably comfortable and appear to be very well made. And the fact that they're made by good folks in Wisconsin is just icing on the cake. I'll update this review as I have more ""miles"" on these babies, but for now I am VERY satisfied. Also - i will concur with some other reviewers that the size seems to run a bit large; I ended up with a 9.5 whereas I normally wear a 10. I suppose everyone's feet are different, so who knows if my experience on sizing will be the same as yours, but that's what I ended up with. Love these American made classics! Yeah, they look good too. The sole is cushy also. Feels good."
5,Awesome boots,"Just received my boots this week and they are better than I expected them to be. I am quite picky with footwear and these shoes have surpassed my expectations. You can't go wrong with these boots and will be quite satisfied. Before purchasing these boots I did look at and was about to buy similar Redwing boots. I'm glad I waited and got these boots which I feel are similar, if not better in quality, for a significantly lesser price. The boots do run 1/2 size big as others have pointed out but I prefer my boots a little on the bigger side."
2,Strange fit,"Right away, one can tell the quality of this boot. It is made WELL.Also right away one can tell that this boot looks HUGE when worn. Bigger even than my army boots. They felt clunky and clumsy, like I was going to trip over my clown-feet.The color was darker than in Amazon's images.A shame since they look so good on the website. I had to return them."
5,Loved it and I will buy another one for my brother!,Very Cool! My friends told that they look cool with jeans and whatever I dress and my Bro asked for a pair!
4,A+ packaging,"The packaging is great(the best of any box set) The song choice was good but could have been better. I think they should have had all of PFY and Easy Action because they are both still out of print. A few more songs off the 80's records would have been nice too like ""Pass the Gun Around"", ""Don't Talk Old to Me"", ""I Better Be Nice"", and few more. Also 2 CDs of live stuff would have been cool. Not songs like ""18"" or No More Mr. Nice Guy songs he only played for one or two tours ""Who Do You Think We Are?"" etc... .The Box Set over all is great"
3,Lots of filler,Alice Cooper has had a long and fruitful career but this box set easily could have been condensed to two discs. Way too much filler on discs three and four.
3,"SINGLE VERSIONS ASIDE, A GOOD OVERVIEW","This collection provides a good overview of the Coop's career thus far. The remastering is revelatory, particularly when compared to the flat sounding reissues of the past. My only gripe is that they used single versions in some cases. There is no excuse for this on a $50-plus set. There are lesser tracks from the early-to-mid 80's that could easily have been omitted to make room for the full-length album tracks. It mars this set somewhat to have the intro gone from ""Welcome to my nightmare,"" one of the Coop's seminal tracks. Still, this isn't a bad place to start."
1,"Good sound, bad songs","As an Alice Cooper fan for over 25 years, I regarded this box set as a missed opportunity bordering on tragedy. The rarely-heard first two psychedelic albums are bypassed almost entirely, and classic tracks such as ""Hallowed Be My Name,"" ""Second Coming,"" ""Halo of Flies,"" ""Luney Tune,"" ""My Stars,"" ""Cold Turk,"" and ""Sick Things"" from the classic LOVE IT TO DEATH, KILLER, and SCHOOL'S OUT, BILLION DOLLAR BABIES period are bypassed in favor of embarrassing '80s and '90s power ballads, presumably because Alice was in a position to negotiate for higher reissue royalties later in his career. Curiously, the liner notes single out ""Luney Tune"" and ""My Stars"" for praise, but you won't find them here. The fact that the remastered sound on LIFE AND CRIMES is so superior to that of WEA's LOVE IT TO DEATH, KILLER, and SCHOOL'S OUT CDs makes the sparce pickings from these albums that much more lamentable."
1,"3% brillance, 97% filler","This is yet another example of the Rhino Records 90s ethos - 3% brilliance, 97% filler. After letting their Straight/Bizarre-licensed reissues of Pretties for You and Easy Action, not to mention the wonderful Live at the Whiskey, go out of print after only a matter of months, they now foist upon the public this bloated eyesore of a boxset. About as necessary as fried pork rinds. Avoid it at all costs."
2,Why get it?,"Who would want to buy this? If you don't know Alice Cooper, why spend the money for a small sampling that doesn't do him justice? If you are a fan, you already have most of this stuff. If you're new to Alice, my advice is to start with Killer, then Billion Dollar Babies, then Love it to Death. Those aren't my favorite albums in order, but it's a good start."
3,lackluster,"I teach U.S. History, and I was looking for a film about Truman to show my students, and I thought that this would be a good one. It is okay, but that is all. I think what is lacking is why Harry S. Truman is considered one of the great presidents, as they claim at the beginning of the program and then again at the end. Nothing in between really gives an indication of why he was such a great president. If all I had to do was watch this, I would not have any reason to think he was great. This film is lackluster, flat, rather boring, and holds little interest for today's teenagers. It's like a sales job from the government via Biography. I expected so much more."
5,Unclear Product Page!,"This is a 2-CD package, incorporating performances of Schubert's trios Opus 99 and Opus 100; both single CDs are still available, with only the color of the cover to distinguish them quickly. La Gaia Scienza is a rigorously ""historically informed"" ensemble, playing keyboard instruments and strings of precisely the sort Schubert might have played and heard. But authenticity is less important than their superb musicianship and their interpretative intensity. I've reviewed both of the separate CDs, if you're interested, as well as their stunning recording of the Piano Quartet and Piano Quintet of Johannes Brahms.Look sharply at the prices for the single CDs in comparison to this double CD package!"
2,poor quality.,"I ordered two of these clipboards to take orders at an international trade show in New York. We did not open them untilwe got to the convention center and then discovered that one (of the two we ordered) was defective. The clipping mechanism did not open. Very frustrating for a such a high priced item and also quite inconvenient. The slide out calculator was quite handy, but again, for the price of the clipboards everything should have been in working order."
2,American Salsa,"This DVD set was disappointing as it is not made clear that it will describe mostly dancing ""on 2""The Set is sparse and the quality is poor.Instruction seems to be badly scripted - if at all...Not really very useful."
5,Very entertaining,"I went to Alaska 2 years ago and loved it. Several of the locations I remembered being there. The other locations make me want to go back again. I was a little afraid that some of the wild animal scenes might get violent, but they didn't. I didn't want to see little bear cubs killed. Anyone planning to go to Alaska, I would recommend they watch this. It's very helpful in getting yourself set up for the trip."
2,So-so,"I got this book to become more familiar with network security. It goes over some good topics and really helps you to understand the ""secure your system"" concept. However, this book is a basic overview for the network manager and I would suggest that you find some other book to go with if you wanna buy it.."
2,"Unpractical, outdated, and useless","Being a hacker, i picked up this book to learn new ways of entering a system. What I found was 200 pages of garbage. The methods described in this book are old, unused, and juvenile. No real hacker uses these methods anymore."
2,Very little information...,"This book is simply a list of schools with contact information. It only has a short description of curriculum (which is not complete), a short section about facilities, and some other information about admissions and tuition. All this information can be obtained from the school's website and it will be more complete and up to date. If you want information on the best schools to go to for animation go the sites of the big F/X and animation companies like Pixar, Digital Domain, and Rythm + Hues. They have lists of schools that they frequently hire from. I was hoping for some more insight and recommendations for choosing a school based on what your field of interest is and where your talents lie. This book is worth about $5, simply because it can save some time in creating a list of possible schools. When you obtain that list or buy this book there is still a lot of research that you need to do, because this book provides very little additional information."
1,Don't bother. The internet is a better tool.,"Don't bother. The internet is better.I purchased this book expecting to get some useful information about 3D animation colleges (since I'm planning to finish getting my BFA soon). While the book does do a decent job in covering tution costs, fees, etc. It lacks in giving the reader useful information about the actual courses offered and what that school's particular cirriculum covers. The book was also missing several (established) art schools that I have located doing my own research on the internet. This book provides nothing more than what a simple search on the internet can provide through such sites as (name)list of schools. A very disappointing book."
5,genius,"by far converge's best album, over jane doe and the new release, you fail me. the saddest day is one of the best hardcore songs ever written. all the musicianship and song writing is so tight and flawless on this release. it also contain the WAY overlooked converge masterpiece, dead. a must have if you in any way like hardcore."
4,Converge - Petitioning the Empty Sky,"One of their best in my opinion, true, it does lose a little wind after the first two tracks (the Saddest Day and Forsaken), but over all shows a band focused in their metal influenced hardcore style."
5,great hardcore cd,"This is band that s very good at switching between brutal riffing and melodic breakdowns. The lyrics are also well writtin making this a treat to anyone into brutal, emotional, and literate hardcore. Highlights of this album are: the saddest day, buried but breathing, and color me blood red.If you like this check out American nightmare, coalesce, a life once lost, saetia, and orchid."
4,One of the best metalcore bands around by far!!,"This is a great(probably the best) release by converge, with an amazing introduction to an albumn(the saddest day). If only the production was a little better with the high fizzing sound on the guitars being lowered a little,this cd wouldnt be so painfull to listen to. Lets just hope that the new albumn ""jane doe"" lives up to the hype and manages to please people as much as ""petitioning"" did."
4,twisted,Compelling drama without resorting to the romantic or maudlin. The intentional vagueness ads alot to the emphemeral quality of the stories. I highly recommend this for people who enjoy non-traditional fiction.
4,The Diaries of Paul Klee,"He began this diary over 100 years ago. It is excellent insight into the extensive energies he would put into his approach tomodern art and where it would take him. It is too bad the diary did not continue to the end of his life since I think his yearsat the Bauhaus and beyond to Bern would be valuable history. But, better to make his art than write about it. Interesting thatit was translated so well from the original German and that his son, Felix added an addendum to his father's diary at the end."
5,Country Vol. 5 - Karaoke CDG Songlist:,"This karaoke CDG contains 15 karaoke songs. No guide vocals.1. Let Your Love Flow - (Bellamy Brothers)2. Let's Make Love - (Faith Hill and Tim McGraw)3.

5,An excellent introduction,"As with all the volumes of this series this work is filled with a large number of photos that seem to tell their own story of the life. The text is excellent .Woolf is a writer I know little about but this work tells her story in a painfully clear way. The early death of her mother, the tyrannical and overwhelmingly difficult if intellectually inspiring father whose death enabled her to be free enough to write are essential elements. What Clive Bell called the greatest luck of her life, her marriage to the devoted Leonard Woolf. Lehmann describes with compassion and understanding Woolf's mental illness, and how this would become most severe towards the end of writing one of her novels. He also gives short summaries of the novels and outlines their special qualities. This is a good introductory volume by a very sympathetic biographer."
5,An Amazing Treasure,"In this day and age where things fall apart after a few uses...or, if you are lucky,after a few years, this little beauty standsHead and shoulders above any processor you will ever buy! I have had mineFor 29 amazing years and it is still as powerful and reliable as the day I got it. And, I don't hindThis processor in a closet. It chops nuts, cheese, vegetables, and meats on a daily basis. ItMakes a mean pesto, sauces, dressings, etc. I dare anyone to find a better productOn the market! I just found one in a thrift store for $3.99 and scooped it up likeI found a discarded Picasso! I was thrilled..and so will my son be when i give itTo him!"
5,Sunbeam Oskar,"I love this! It fits on my counter and into my life! I have a disabled daughter who has to have her food ground.This little guy can handle the load. I grind everything including steaks and cheeseburgers fully dressed from the grill. My daughter is 31 and this has been going on since we let baby food behind. I had had three in 30 years! I use it at least twice a day. I have tried smaller ones, larger ones and sexier ones. Nothing beats the Oskar!"
2,"powerful, but too small","This food processor (and others in this size range, I'm sure) just don't have enough room. Anything that I wanted to chop / dice / mince had to be chopped small to fit into the hopper. There wasn't much point in using it because I had to do so much prep work first. I finally bought a full size model (Kitchenaid), and I suggest the same for anyone else looking for a food processor.I have found a use for this one, however. I keep it in the laundry room. In the summer the humidity makes my powdered laundry detergent clump up like a brick. I put a chunk of the soap in here, and take it for a spin. It works great!"
5,Love it!,I bought mine at a thrift store I paid about $5 for it. Although it didn't come with the processor part and cheese grater. I use it for making my famous salsa and guacamole. I love it and would be sad if it ever died. I hate cleaning kitchen gagets. this one is cake to clean.
5,Perfect sized processor - Oskar,"I have used mine since the 80's. Whenever I need to make salsa, it grinds the the garlic perfectly and the Jalapenos also. Making guacamole is also a dream with Oskar. For making marinade using garlic and Jalapenos it is also perfect. Using a large food processor does not make sense for salsa and guacamole, you would not get the same perfectly small granular sized bits of garlic and chiles you want to spread out that taste. Making Chocolate chip cookies I need this to grind those walnuts to whatever sized chucks I prefer. Oskar is the ONLY food processor I use. Another use is grinding (you don't want big chunks ? yuck!) those gizzards and giblets for making real Thanksgiving dressing. One other thing, I bought one for my brother because he borrowed mine so often, at the local swap meet for $7. It was his favorite birthday gift, even though it was used and yellowed from age."
4,mistake....,"I too intended to buy the watch pictured above with the gunmetal dial and round face. A different Kenneth COle watch came with a rectangular face. My wife liked it better so we kept it, but beware they will send you the wrong watch."
5,Excellent knives!,"This is the fourth knife of the Alton's Angle KAI Shun knives I have purchased. They are excellent knives which hold an edge. I am sure the Pro and Pro2 series would be nicer, but they are much more expensive, so I decided to try this line. The craftsmanship is excellent and the design ensures comfortable use. These have the 16 degree two-sided double-bevel edge (as opposed to the single-bevel on the Pro and Pro2). My previous knives (Sabatier Cousine de France) which I have been using for over 20 years do not come close in sharpness and then Sabatier is no longer a French company, so I decided to go Japanese from Seki. Well worth the money. In the future I will probably get a Pro or Pro2 for those really intricate kitchen chores."
2,Drip cap does not function,The plant food works fine (I've used it before) but the pouring cap was defective and I cannot use the drop delivery system.
5,plants love it,I have used this product for years and it never fails. My plants last for years and years and are healthy.
1,Not sure it worked...,..Cause now my plants are dead..thought my plants would flourish it just didn't help at all. I expected them to grow like weeds didn't happen.
1,Killed my plant,"I got this item and used it as directed by putting a few drops in the soil before planting my plant. The next day when I got up, but originally healthy plant was dead and shriveled up. Last time I use plant food if it is going to kill my plant rather than make it bigger and healthier."
4,Good as long as you don't use too much or too little,"The directions give you different fertilizing schedules you can use. One of them is every time you water your plants. This makes it so much easier because you don't have to remember or write down when you use it to figure out when to use it again.Using the less often fertilizing schedule, I and some people I know have killed plants following the directions, so I believe the recommended amount is too much for some plants. So I use the every time you water schedule, but from time to time, I skip putting fertilizer in the water."
4,It's plant food,Not too much to say. It's plant food. Do you have plants? Do you want to give them food? Then this is a good option. DONE!See? Wasn't that simple?
3,Not too impressed,"I picked up four mini roses at the local grocery store and i wanted them to survive and bloom as long as they possibly could...and after a lot of research i decided on the miracle gro...suffice it to say that i haven't had any miracles with this product and im not sure if i will repurchase...sure, the roses bloomed, but no different from a 'control' plant i had going without the stuff...so i really havent witnessed anything extraordinary with its usage...however, i would like to add that i live in an apartment with no direct sunlight and the plants i bought were not of the highest quality so there is a chance that it might work under different conditions...my review of the product is intended ONLY for average quality house plants..."
4,It's a cool cd....,"It's not perfect, but I liked it's originality. None is really scary, just some of the songs are kinda odd. I reccomend it just because it is different!"
3,Dastgah Nava,This CD has some really great Islamic or more so traditional Iranian chant/music. I recommend it if you are looking for that Islamic song style. No I am not Islamic. The Assyryian art cover is not related but it looks good and is what originally caught my eye.
3,"The Doctor, Space Marines and Dragons","By no means a groundbreaking novel, yet an entertaining one that proceeds along at a cracking pace. Christopher Bulis captures the voices of all four leads perfectly (though the First Doctor is slightly more active than in the televised stories), and the mystery of the seemingly magic- and fantasy-based planet is convincingly hidden till the end. Though a mash-up between fantasy and sci-fi sounds like a terrible idea, Bulis somehow pulls it off and avoids the thudding genre clash that so often occurs in such attempts. If you're a Doctor Who fan, you'll likely enjoy this novel. And if you're specifically a fan of the team of Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Susan, and dearly wish (like me) that they could have had more adventures together, there's no doubt: This book will surely satisfy, and scratch that itch."
2,Dry and Dull Perspective,"What makes good history writers versus dull (bad) history writers is the ability to, through the written word, effectively communicate the writer's perspective, while at the same time entertaining the reader. Chadwick crams a lot of information but a lot of information does not necessarily make for a very enjoyable read. The author's plodding writing style, repeating of the same ideas, and the need to present as much detail information as possible is a book more along the lines of a PHD thesis. Even the chapters are broken into subchapters, as though the author were addressing a university facility group or class, as opposed to the general reader.Stay away from this book. Read Leckie's Washington's War; an accurate, detailed, and at the same time enjoyable read."
4,George Washington - The Irreplacable Man,"George Washington's War is a portrait of Washington's irreplaceable leadership in the American War of Independence. Bruce Chadwick vividly describes the tremendous difficulties Washington overcame to keep an army in the field, and his underrated qualities as an administrator and tactician. In the end we see Washington as the central figure in America's long struggle to gain her independence."
1,Wasting Washington's War,"There are great overviews of the American Revolution: Angel in the Whirlwind, there are great analyses of critical moments: Washington's Crossing and there are many great biographies: John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, The First American. This tries to be all three fails miserably across the board. No insights, no new news and poor editing make this a real slog."
1,Not Armenian,"This CD is completely Turkish. The only Armenian thing about it are the singers. It may deserve 5 stars, I cannot be the judge of that. It should be filed under Turkish music."
5,"A must have for collectors, fans, and hi-fi nuts","If you're content with an MP3 and hear enough Cars on the radio you don't need to get this CD. But, if you're a Cars fan and want to hear this album as if it's brand new again the deluxe edition is for you. I've been collecting remasters of many 60s, 70s, and 80s albums. The list of material that sounded better on vinyl than the CD is shrinking with remastering of some of them. While there's only so much that could be done with this one thanks to rather noisy master tapes this version does breathe new life into it. If you've liked what remastering has done for some others you're bound to enjoy The Cars, deluxe edition."
4,A Story That Changed Our Life,"Ralph's account of what it took to leave his mega-church in Hermosa Beach and begin again in Hawaii is inspiring. I was there with him and saw how much he sacrificed to create not only a new church, but a movement that has spread around the world. Good read, especially if you have any part in the story."
2,"Music good, but several track skip","The music was good, but several of the tracks either skipped or would not play. I tried it on a different player with the same results.I am going to return it."
1,Does not have the same effect,"I have used this product from another seller. This one did not have one hundredth of the burning and warming effect as compared to my previous experience. I even stirred the ointment, just in case I was missing on an ingredient that might have settled on the bottom of the jar. I don't know if this is a different manufacturer, but I will buy from a different seller next time."
5,Unknown Genius,"This disc features the unknown genius of the Blues, John T. ""Funny Papa"" Smith, whose record company mistakenly called him ""Funny Paper"". There are many stand-out songs on this collection, but ""Fool's Blues"" and the two part ""Seven Sisters Blues"" are two of the greatest songs in the history of American music. The guitar playing in these songs, and the majority of Smith's work, is melodically complex but relies on simple bass riffs, and the lyrics are surely 100% original and were never used by any other Blues singers in the history of the music. Smith's voice is easy to listen to, the fidelity of the tracks is excellent, and all of the lyrics are easy to understand. This is essential listening, and it's a terrible shame that more people don't know about this wonderful musician, who was a lyrical genius whom Bob Dylan should envy."
4,Precious Metal Clay- Creative Projects for the Beginner,"This book was helpful in getting me started with PMC. The projects were quite creative and motivating.Unfortunately, at the time this book was written there was only PMC standard and plus. Many new products have since been released and so aren't covered.I would purchase this book for easy, fun, creative projects, but would purchase an additional book for info on the newest materials."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. As stated in one of the other reviews, some of the projects were too craftsy. At $32 an ounce, I'm not going to waste the clay by making little charms that hang off a lamp shade. Also, all the pictures are in black and white which I consider a major drawback. Creating with precious metal is a very visual and tactile medium. The book would be higher quality with color photos."
2,very cursory view of this new medium,"This book provides a VERY general look at this new medium. Very briefly discusses differences between PMC standard and PMC+ without mentioning PMC3. No good information about kiln parameters, the various forms of the clay (syringe, sheet, block etc) or any extensive discussion of tips/techniques. Actually, I found MUCH more infomation in 'Polymer Clay Explorations: Exploring New Techniques, New Materials' by Georgia Sargeant et al. If I'd flipped through this book in person at a store, I would have left it on the shelf."
1,Too crafty,There is only ideas on how to make pendants and things of that nature. PMC looks like it would be better for rings and chains than what they used it for. I got more detailed information from free sites online. Had I been able to see the table of contents online I would have passed it by.
3,"Beutiful, but not as good as the orginal broadcast","Although the video is well-made the music / sound quality is not what it should be. In the original broadcast the skaters skated silently to the music. In the video and dvd (I have tried both) the creators have seem to have added in the sound of the skates on the ice. These sounds are not quiet whisphers, they are loud scraping sounds that destroy the effect of the music and the etheral quality of the performances. This video would rank five stars if not for this."
4,latest edition of a great book,"Disclaimer: I haven't read the third edition. However, I still assign Newton & Dillingham's discussion of Love Canal in the first edition of Watersheds. The book isn't quite as distinctive as it used to be, but it's an excellent collection of accessible and fair-minded case studies. I would also recommend Judith Layzer's _The Environmental Case_, which places more emphasis on policy analysis (as opposed to ethics) and perhaps goes farther into some factual details. Any reviewer who recommends _Trashing the Planet_ to get the ""other side"" of ten different environmental issues has a pretty one-dimensional approach to environmental issues in general. Newton & Dillingham do believe that environmental problems are real, but beyond that they have no axes to grind."
1,What do you know..,A total waste of $. There are 2 pages out of 128 that deal with blood banking. The rest are all general lab questions and answers.I woud have never purchased this..
3,its okay,"While it seems to be a good light, the magnets are not strong enough to hold it down at highway speeds. After it fell off our semi and only having the cord keeping it from falling off completely, we had to come up with some clamps to keep it on our lightbar. Luckly enough, the light did not break and still works as it should."
2,Works but poorly,"This holds a charge, but unlike the original battery is already down to one bar at the end of the day. You get what you pay for"
2,Does it compare?,"This battery doesn't compare to some of the others on the market. It looses power way too quickly. I can't wait for my contract to be up on my cell phone so I can get a different phone, hopefully one that has a better battery.Yes, I know I could buy another phone but why when they come free with a contract? Oh...yeah...cause the free ones have bad batteries! LOL."
5,I hope the film's 1/2 as good ...,"I remember ditching school almost twenty years ago, buying a copy of this book and finishing it that same day.It was so good that I took it with me a few years later when I served aboard one of the last diesel submarines in the US Navy. The book made the rounds and was thoroughly enjoyed by my shipmates, who found the descriptions of the WW2-era fleetboat quite realistic.The story was intriguing, with time travel and ghosts, too -- I just wish I could find my copy. Haven't seen it since '83. I wonder if Chief Donald Hunt, STSC(SS), still has it? Are you out there, Chief?"
2,Ghost Boat Revisited,I read this book back in the eighties and found it riveting. It was passed around the office and everyone was impressed. I'm reading it again and it is just as engrossing the second time around.Palmer
2,Costly Call book 1 review,"Violent examples of persecution by Muslims against Muslims converting to Christianity. A sobering series of testimonies of ordinary people desperately seeking reality by escaping from painful and meaningless religious dogmas and rituals. Even though only Muslim persecution was portrayed, I have seen similar persecution used against Christians converting from other religions as well. I would not take the theme as attempting to bring extreme Muslims into a negative light as an attempt to contrast religious inflexibility and intolerance with a desperate search for true purpose and personal meaningfulness to life."
