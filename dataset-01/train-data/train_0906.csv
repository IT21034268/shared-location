5,granddaughter loves it,this set had so much in it for our granddaughter who loves playing teacher - price is right and it arrived right away.
4,Teacher loved it!,This makes a great teacher gift! The stamps are very appropriate and useful. A lid on the box would have been nice for storage.Good quality item!
4,Great quality and design..and very reasonable. My grand daughter loved the school set and has used it many time. I would,recommend this gift to anyone. Doug and Melissa products are very good quality and well designed for children of all ages
5,awesome,my kid hasnt put it down since getting it high quality as always from melissa and doug worth every penny
3,Do not buy if you are a teacher!,"The stamps are good... the ink pad is not, the pencils are horrible and the box it comes in falls apart. If you are a teacher, I would get something else. Perfect for a child wanting to play school or something though."
5,Makes you sing along!!,"I love this cd!! I work at a children's store and listen to all sorts of children's music...all day long!!! Sometimes the cd's can become annoying, but every time this one comes on you just have to sing along! It's so fun!!"
1,Creepie,"Higher Ground? Hardly. This was a negative movie. The message? Despair. It was creepie. ""Higher Ground"" has more in common with ""The Wasteland"" than elevated terrain. It doesn't take twenty words to say this movie was weird.Previous reviews must have been written by the promoters of this sad tripe."
4,Almost goes far enough....,This film mostly succeeds in showing the gradual transformation of a woman from a fundamentalist wife and mother to a doubter and a searching soul who leaves the church behind as well as her husband when she has several crises of faith. I would have like to see her say something about what happens to her friend with the brain tumor; she says nothing although she looks torn up.
1,What absolute rubbish!,"This was both a waste of money to rent and the time it took to watch. It appears like a film shot by some stupid kid with a super 8. The acting is moronic. The story is junk and the people look funky (in a bad way). Please...for the love of God, do not make a sequel."
2,Needs re-organized,"This book would be better if it was re-organized. By chapter 4 you are entering a program, but you can't run it until after several more chapters, as creating resource files isn't discussed until chapter 6. Without the resource files (icons, form definition, etc.) the program can't run. Sort of disappointing after typing in all that code.The books web site includes complete code for those using either CodeWarrior 8 or 9, but if you are using PODS you are out of luck. It discusses PODS, but as something of an after thought. The PODS documentation will serve you far better.I also hope you are already familiar with C/C++ programming.All the information to program for Palm OS appears to be here, but you will have to hunt around for it and be familiar with what you are doing.Definitely not a raw beginner's guide."
1,white man propagrandai,"extremely disappointing; nothing but propaganda; might as well go back to US kindergarden for an understanding of the american indian experience; horrible ""documentary,"" 100% slanted in favor of the white-man settler / military ""heros"". Waste of money, unless you like the old unintelligent cowboys and indians stories we americans were brought up with."
1,Sucks,"Sucks, period, probably made by the government since it tries to validate the killings of so many of us indigineous people."
2,Slanted against the dispossed aboriginal peoples,"Forgive me for not having the time to thoroughly research my objections, but this documentary is decidedly and unacceptably (IMO) slanted toward the Euro settlers. That slant and the inexpensive (read: cheesy) production values lead me to wonder how well the writers researched the subject. I felt as if I might be learning some interesting information, for instance, estimates of the numbers of aboriginals killed vs. the number of Euro settlers. But I had to wonder how much of this was outdated information, old saws & anecdotes along the lines of ""George Washington chopped down the cherry tree"" that have long been generally accepted but bear little resemblance to historical fact. Watch this with considerable skepticism."
4,We stuck it to the Indians time and time again.,It was somewhat depressing but a lot of history and mistakes repeatedly made in our dealings with the Native Americans
1,"Really, REALLY Bad!!","I picked this up due to the price and good reviews (in my experience 3+ stars is very good).HOWEVER, even at $4 this is a MASSIVE waste of money.I could not find 1 redeeming quality about it.Among the MANY Cons:Horribly mono-toned narration (Almost put me to sleep)Bad Research (So many falsehoods I wanted to throw my remote at the TV - the Seminoles ""were defeated"" [among other falsehoods and straight up LIES], what BS!!)Camcorder-style video quality (seriously!!)Tacky Writing (a Community Collegian could do better)Ridiculously uneven coverage of the Native North American tribesIf I could rate this at Zero or a 1/2 Star I would. I am SHREDDING my copy of this DVD (and will recycle the case)!!PLEASE ... DO NOT waste your money on this garbage!!"
1,A very biased point of view,"I agree 100% with Reviewer Douglas. I would of given it 0 stars if I could. Every massacre to the Indians seemed almost justified. If you really want to learn the truth of what really happened I would suggest getting a hold of the documentary ""500 Nations"". Its far better cinematically and historically with eyewitness accounts from both sides."
4,Plasmaglow purple frame,"I bought this to replace one that had been hit in an accident. It looks nice and installs in the same holes as the license plate, you just need screws that are a little more then an inch long. You can hook it to the power and ground of the headlights if you want it to come on with them, or you can hook it to a switch (which is what I did) so you can turn it on or off when you want."
4,AMAZING!!!!!,This book was one of the best books i have ever read written by one of the best authors around.Every thing jst seems so real and you ca just imagine yourselfs in the bok. FABULOUS
3,it had to continue,"The first in this series by Blake Crouch is excellent. Desert Places is full of all the tension and relentless evil and suspense which I found extremely well written. This follow-up.... well, it seemed to be functional so as to continue the story. It's not bad. It's just not as good as I was hoping it to be. I will continue with Blake Crouch. The story (as the trilogy) is great and so is Blake."
3,confusing,Liked the book eventually but for a long while was confused by the story line. Will probably read more of this writer
4,A Locked Door won't save you from Luthor!,"Lots of action, gut wrenching violence and edge of your seat suspense. In short everything you would expect from a thriller."
2,CRIME NOVEL,"AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR TRAVELING. KEEP IT WITH YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE, AND THROW IT OFF THE FIRST BRIDGE YOU CROSS. AS A CRIME NOVEL GOES, THE ONLY CRIME IS THAT I BOUGHT IT! IF THIS WAS THE FIRST OF CROUCH'S BOOKS THAT I BOUGHT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST."
4,Creepy in a good way,I was very happy to hear more about what happened to Andrew. You really need to read Desert Places before this one to get the full effect. You have to have a stomach for some hard core violence. The suspense it fabulous and the character building done very realistically. It makes you want to read the next one!
3,gory,"this was alittle to bloody for me. i wanted to just kill the killers, good characters you can love or hate."
2,Disappointing sequel,"As soon as I finished Desert Places, I ordered this sequel. Locked Doors is completely disappointing. Andrew Thomas seems to have lost any semblance of the intelligence he had in Desert Places because in Locked Doors, most of his actions are out of character. Halfway through the book, I was bored because the storyline was repetitious and Crouch spent more time describing the setting/surroundings than any action or insight into the leading characters. He includes one character for the sole purpose of setting up a sequel which I have no interest in reading."
2,Yawn.,"This book certainly falls short of thrilling me. About half-way through the book, I was rolling my eyes and then yawning. It feels like the author tried to throw every gruesome thing he could think of into this book to the effect that it just become ridiculous. Maybe I'll give the (hopefully) final book in this series a try."
5,Highly recommended,"This is a book which can be read on many different levels. It is about one woman and her relationships, it is about different cultures and how they interact, clash and come together, and it is about the force of history and tradition. It is also about every woman's need for a home, about choices and what determines them. The author, a Pakistani who has lived in California, in England and in Dubai, deals in masterly fashion with all these themes in her first book, which was recommended to me for its delightful evocation of life in Lahore and the insight into problems which can arise when an outsider decides to marry and settle in Pakistan. One of the characters, Madeline, is a woman of our times and the reader is left hoping she has made the right choice, but it is the universality of Zulaikha's story which will stay etched in the reader's memory."
4,Facing Shadows,"In another session of the California Lecture Series in Sacramento, CA, I had the pleasure of listening to Ha Jin in a live interview with Jeffry Calison of Public Radio and was enchanted with the strength, courage, gentleness of this man. Born in mainland China, he immigrated to the United States in his late twenties, earned a Ph.D in English from Brandeis University in 1992. This book of poems runs a scope of emotions and will not fail to move the reader."
5,It Works!,I purchased this to heal 1 of my danio's which had a small cut near it's dorsal fin. This product worked so fast that I second guessed myself about the cut (maybe it wasn't lol)I only needed to treat the danio for 24 hrs. By the next evening the cut was almost invisible and activity was back to normal. This is a natural Tea Tree product so it has a strong smell to it. Not a bad smell (it's tea tree extract) but a strong one. The smell goes away pretty fast after you replace the carbon in your filter.
1,Save your money,"In the first place, although advertised as a DVD, I received a video tape (VCR) version....Not a good thing!Secondly, if you have absolutely no idea of what a handgun is, then you may find this product informative. The video does an adequate job of explaining the difference between the trigger, the hammer, and the barrel. Even then, it's worth only half of the list price (at best).The product spent too much time explaining what a handgun is and how to load and unload the cartridges, and too little time exploring shooting techniques.To say that the presentation is overly elementary is an understatement."
2,"It's fine when it's fresh, and not been sitting around","This product has become hit-or-miss lately. I think Amazon has been getting old shipments, or this product is sitting around in their warehouse too long. It's supposed to have a creamy consistency, yet lately, the shipments I've received have been gooey, like old peanut butter, with oily separation, and it's still a few months away from the printed expiration date. Not continuing my subscription of this cream."
1,Good customer service terrible product.,"I ordered the .5 oz. Jason red eye cream. When I received it - it clearly was quite old and dried up. The oil had separated and what was left was thick brown goo.However, the customer service credited my account asap."
2,Not a great fit...,"In themselves, these boots seem fine: the fit closely over standard cat5 cable, and make a *very* snug fit over an 8P8C connector. They're very unlikely to slip off.However, their external dimensions are such that connectors fitted with these boots WILL NOT FIT into adjacent slots on several popular items of home networking equipment, as they protrude into the space occupied by either the adjacent sockets, or the hardware case:1. I tried to connect four cables with these hoods fitted into a Netgear router, and had to remove the hoods from alternate cables to get the plugs into the sockets.2. Even a single cable fitted with this hood will not fit into my Motorola cable modem, as it collides with the casing on the back of the unit. I spent a lot of time (admittedly, not much money!) re-wiring my home network and moving equipment around, to find that these hoods make some connections impossible in much of my hardware."
3,"Cheap, works ok.","I bought these along with some plugs to crimp cables of arbitrary lengths at home.Because, they're boring old cable accessories, they come in a ziplock baggie, without instructions or tools.I made a 1 foot cable, remembering to pop these onto the cable before I crimped.They stay on just by friction, holding onto the plug.The color is like 'shamrock' from the crayola colors listed here ([...]).Only with your monitor all dimmed out.I saw another review complain about the width of theirs.I was able to plug them in just fine between my zte gateway and asus dark knight wireless ap.Hope you bought some shamrock green cable to match.I didn't. Mine is gray, like the sea after a storm.But, the matching gray were 2 dollars more.I did wonder if there's a magic way to fuse/weld the end to the cable so they don't move, like a commercial cable.But, then I got an E_OUTOFCARING exception and moved on."
1,Don't buy GE Spacemaker OTR Microwave,"These microwaves are short lived and expensive to repair. GE customer service is terrible and unreliable. Don't believe me, just do a search on the web for GE Spacemaker OTR and read ALL of the complaints for yourself. Avoid the nightmares buy something other than GE!"
1,Door prone to cracking,"I had used two Spacemaker when I lived in an apartment and my existing townhouse respectively. They were both built-in by the builders. I have the same problem with both -- the door cracks as a result of the heat from cooking. My landlord replaced it for me when I lived in an apartment. When I needed to replace the one in my existing home, I was told that it costs $50 to get a replacement. I happened to talk to my friend who has the same problem and she had replaced one already but the new door started to crack again after a while. So I decided not to replace it, which turned out to be a good choice because it stopped heating after merely three years of service. I have since used a Whirlpool for two years without problems. I have the feeling that the manufacturer sell them to the builders at a low rate and hope to make money on accessories."
3,What You Get...,"The four films on this release bridge the gap between sci-fi and horror. Titles included are: KILLER EYE, in which a homeless man's eye goes on a kill-crazy rampage after being removed from its socket by a mad scientist; KRAA! THE SEA MONSTER, which finds the earth under threat from alien forces who have released a gigantic sea monster on the planet; MURDERCYCLE, in which a motorcyclist is possessed by an alien who transforms him into a killing machine; and the wonderfully named ZARKORR! THE INVADER, which sees a postal worker and a 5-inch-tall female hologram trying to stop an alien creature before it destroys the world."
2,Great Band Stays in a Rut,"Lambchop's masterpiece album Nixon whetted my appetite for greatness but I must say their subsequent albums have proven disappointing. Yes, there is the melancholy twang and Wagner's plaintive, almost lugubrious singing but the trap is that all their songs are starting to sound like the same song. They're pretty much singing the same aching, slow, down on their luck song over and over again. Everything Wagner sings sounds like an inferior variation of his most lovely ballads from Nixon, especially his wonderful song, ""The Old Gold Shoe."" If you don't believe me, play post-Nixon albums and I'm confident you'll agree. Or perhaps you like hearing ""The Old Gold Shoe"" over and over in all its mutations. If so, this album is for you."
1,"BURT""LAMBCHOP""BACHARACH""","Sorry,but this sucks! after reaching their zenith with""what another man spills"",its been all down hill!these latest two cds continue the same horrible soul/lounge music,as ""nixon""and""is a woman"",but much worse!we went from a good ameicana/soul mix,to burt bacharach!if thats your cup of tea,then all the power to ya!"
4,REMARKABLE,"This book goes into great detail of the creation of all things as how every thing is connected. It is writing in a way that the simple mind can grasp it.I was amazed at the revelation he had. He died in 1927 at the age of 45. He said some things that are just now coming to light in the church today. However, I would not recomend this book for someone that is a babe in there spiritual walk for fear of going to far in worshipping the wrong thing. They have to realize who God really is!"
2,I guess if you like Remo...,"I can see the appeal of Remo -- the dialogue and action are funny and fast-paced, and some of the names and situations are pretty hilarious. This book also had some intriguing mystical undercurrents. However, if rampant bloody killing (by our heroes, not the villains) and a singular lack of sympathy for abruptly-ended lives doesn't float your boat (I mean, I guess few people care about killing Stormtrooper-equivalents), or if some mild misogyny and other insensitivities get on your nerves, don't bother. The concepts of mercy and change of heart make brief cameo appearances, but don't look for them to play leading roles. A fun, silly, bloody, shallow, violent, sometimes unpleasant read."
4,"Great, but break out the gas mask","Upon opening the package I was practically knocked out by the fumes emitting from this thing. I live in a small place and sleep close to my stereo, and was not about to spend all night breathing in whatever chemicals were used to produce the insulation on this. After two weeks airing out on the porch, I was able to bring the cable in and hook it up. It's great to listen to the music on my computer without having to burn everything to a disk.I guess I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the toxic shock."
5,The perfect book for RVers who want to explore Baja.,"Adventurer and author Walt Petersondoes it again! With son Michael, hehas produced a guide to Baja forthose who want to explore this place ofmany wonders by RV. Walt and Michaelprovide an extraordinary book, filled withall the information RVers will need tohave a really great adventure in Baja.For those who prefer to rough it, Walt'sacclaimed Baja AdventureBook isjust the ticket"
3,"Compelling, Confusing, Constance....","I am a big fan of Ray Bradbury's work. He is a genious in literature. However, this book fell short of what I expected from him.The book starts off excellant. There is a good build up and it is very quick and interesting. As the plot thickens (hehe) things tended to get a little bit confusing to me. Part of it is Bradbury's classic writing style mixed with a very odd plot. The other part is sheer madness. Everything comes back into focus for the end only to end on an off note, almost leaving you hanging.Again, let me reiterate that this is not a bad novel at all, but as far as Ray Bradbury's work goes, it is on a lower level. If perhaps this was another author I would easily give it 4 stars, but I expected more out of a Bradbury novel.If you are a die hard fan of Mr. Bradbury's work, check this one out, however if you are new to his work, start off with one of his well known classics."
3,A labrinyth of mystery,"The novel is very much a Bradbury one-surreal, inventive and always esoteric, full of trivia and various Hollywood references. In fact, esoteric is the keyword. You either enjoy Bradbury's quirky, offbeat style of plot (and I should add that this one if particularly quirky, quite unlike most plots) or you don't. At it's best, this novel is rather good-there are some wonderfully memorable moments, including a trip to ""a labrinyth of newsprint"" that is reminescent of the library parts of 'Something Wicked This Way Comes"". It's not Bradbury's best, but it is certainly not his worst, and is above average."
3,",","I couldn't help but like the gothic cliches reworked but every few pages I was saying ""Really, book? I've got to call you out on your bull.""The biggest problem was the sight issue...The leading lady cannot see someone standing right next to her night after night because it is too dark, but she can jog in a wooded area the same nights in the same area and never run into a tree?"
5,Your Best Trail Friend,"I have used this book since 1980 to hike all or part of the PCT. It can make or break your trip. The most important info is where to find water. Some souces are difficult to find, but this book will lead you to it. The amount of info,maps, water, landmarks, milage,trail conditions, suppy points, etc., make this book a must on any hike along the PCT. If you don't have it with you, you're a lost soul."
2,Not a big thrill.,"We weren't really impressed with this product. We used it without a condom and it didn't stay put. Also, since ordering this product I continue to receive junk mail to the email address I used. I don't appreciate that at all."
3,Some enjoyment,Me and my girlfriend like to change things up in the bedroom so i bought one of these. Not bad but only lasts for 30 min or so. Was fun bu wouldnt buy another one. Better toys that you can replace the batteries in and get more fun from are out there.
3,Its a good fit but...,"I bought this Shift Knob A few days ago. I owned a 2011 Scion Tc and the installation was fairly easy. I installed it in less than 5min, the only problem I see with this product in my opinion is that it extends the length of the overall shaft...it seems higher than with my stock knob, but its o.k it looks great none then less. I super glue the spacer to a 3inch (length) bolt to the bottom of the plate inside the knob seeing that I have on use for the push down button on the top, and I can always change it to my stock knob If I wish, with no damage to the shaft itself...YAY!"
3,Shift Knob for Honda Accord,"I did like the product but required to do several modification. I have a Honda Accord 93 and the shift knob has to be modified to fit, also after a few days the knob started to move quite a bit hence I have to re-tightened the screws but while putting the bottom cover I had a hard time fitting it properly. The product looks good but needs better construction, for the price I would say it is a good back up shift knob."
2,Not worth it!,"This shift knob seemed to be well built, but came loose within two days. Also the instructions were not very detailed or helpful for that matter."
3,"good, but its NOT metal",it didnt not fit on my car so i had to highly modify my shaft to accept it. and it took about 3 hours. someone skilled might do it in 2hrs. the thing that scares me is if it brakes im screwed. but it does look cool. it does feel like cheap plastic tho. if it was real metal and not plastic i would give it a 5 star.
3,"easy on the eye, but need the patience to install it",Got this from a friend who said that it was easy to install but found out that one of the screw was bad and didnt hold the shift knob into place. any idea where to buy another screw for this?
1,Uhm Doesnt Fit,"Tried to fit this on to my car, but for some reason doesn't fit my 2003 cavalier. We'll see if i can fix, only then will I change this review."
1,YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR,I PUT THIS IN MY 2004 MONTE CARLO AND IT DIDNT LAST A DAY. THE SCREWS ARE NOT VERY STURDY SO IT CAME LOOSE AND AFTER HOURS OF FRUSTRATION I JUST BOUGHT A SMITH N WESSON ONE (WHO KNE THEY MADE THEM :) - FOR THE SAME PRICE!!
3,Automatic shift knob,Nice knob for the money. It has a problem loosening up even after loctite on the screws. It is still usable as is.
5,Automatic Shift Knob,"I looked for a Shift Knob on ebay and other sites,butdid not find what I was looking for until I found one of two Knobs on Amazon.The Knob that I bought worked just right on my Cadillac."
4,"Less than great construction, but looks good once installed","I bought this for my automatic 2004 Chevy Cavalier. This shifter looks very good in person, and since it's aluminum (and not plastic) it has a nice heft to it. Installation was easy, until I ran into issues with the shift knob falling apart. The top section with the button is not very well secured to the rest of the shifter, and popped off when I tried to shift the first time with it (good thing I was in a driveway). A little quality adhesive did the trick, and after getting the set screws just right (the most time consuming part of the install) I had a spiffy aluminum shifter. Anticipated downside: in a black car with a black interior on a 90 degree day, a metal shift knob becomes scorchingly hot. Just something to keep in mind if those conditions apply to you. All in all, aside from some slight build quality issues, this is a nice looking but not too flashy shifter knob that adds a little class to a dated car."
4,Very nice quality,"These coasters are exactly as shown in the pictures, which worked perfectly with my decor. Very happy with my purchase!"
1,Socks for Christmas,"Read this to my daughter without reading first as it was a gift from her Uncle. She just turned 9 and is questioning Santa and the magic of Christmas. Well, if she was questioning before, and I had continued to read this there would have been no more Santa in our house! PLEASE do not give this book until after a child knows that Santa is your parents..... We have spent years teaching our daughter to give to others less fortunate... so...this is a lesson she did not need. Thanks..."
3,Good story,"My copy of the book came with an audio version too. I play it all the time for my toddler son, I want him to grow up without a materialistic view of Christmas. This story is a very short but good reminder about the blessings in life that we overlook. Such as socks....."
2,Disappointed,"It was fun to see pictures of some favorite childhood toys, but the book was a disappointment. Too much time spent on everything but the message. I am an Andrews fan, but this book is not up to his usual standard. Not worth the price."
3,Good info...but just a repeat!,"I am glad I only got this from the library first. This book is pretty much just a repeat of the Formula, previously written by the same couple. Even the recipes are the same except for maybe a couple. I like the formula book better and have purchased that one...it has more recipes.If you don't have the Formula, this book still has helpful information and good recipes (just not as many) and is giving you more of a maintenance plan. The irst Formula book also offers the 21 day Fat Flush program to follow. The recipes in this book are very good though, and this at least deserves 3 stars for that (if you don't already own the first). My opinion is to purchase the Formula, and save money on the soft cover."
3,Formula 101 vs The Formula,"I have to admit, I was pretty excited when I read that a sequel was coming out. I have been on the formula diet since September and was getting pretty tired of the recipes. When I received the book, I felt that I was rereading the original book but with less recipes! I highly recommend the original Formula not only for the nutritional information (same in both books), but also for the recipes. It makes being on this diet a no brainer and the food is really good."
4,Worth Buying,"This book answers and clarifys many issues about ""The Formula"". It is a good companion to those following this diet or the Zone. Thanks to the authors for simplifying the Zone and making the 40-30-30 nutrition much easier to follow. The recipies are great. The Formula is the best and healthiest diet I have ever been on. My blood sugar has become manageable (I am diabetic) and under control and I have gone off of insulin. I highly recommend both Formula books. If there were more questions and answers and some better clarity on maintenance I would have rated the book 5 stars."
4,A Worth While Book,"People interested in the 40-30-30 nutrition plan can find many interesting and helpful tips in this book. It also contains some great recipes. While it is not an exciting read, I found that the concepts presented one at a time with explanation helped my to enhance my understanding of what works with 40-30-30 nutrition. The recipes are useful in themselves and also served as examples for me with my own meal planning.The first book in the Daoust's series (40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition) is the ""bible"" and I keep it in easy reach all the time for the tables it contains, but ""Formula 101"" has helped me broaden my understanding and better use this nutrition concept. That's why I am sending a copy of ""101"" to the friend who gave me my copy of ""40-30-30 Fat Burning Nurtition""."
3,Moderately Useful Information,"This book was very easy to read and I was able to read in a couple days. I thought it was better than their first book, 40-30-30, but basically it is just an expansion of that book, so I was disappointed in the redundancies and felt I sort of wasted my money. They just packaged it with a slightly different title, rather than do a revised version of the book.I like their explanations of why one should eat this way and I think they have simplified it from how The Zone does it, however, I've found an even easier way to eat the 40-30-30 plan that is extremely easy for a busy person like me. And, I've found a way to do this without having to do much cooking or preparation, yet still eating naturally. They made it a little more complicated than it needed to be (but less complicated than The Zone)."
3,Read It and Sleep,"I am going to write an unfair review. This book is probably useful for scholars or fans of Woodrow Wilson. However, I did not find it very interesting. Woodrow Wilson was not one of my favorite presidents. The book did not change my mind about him. It was not a good ""read"" and it was not sufficiently informative to me to justify reading through the pedestrian prose. In addition, I am told that Wilson scholarship is now more advanced and perhaps kinder to Wilson in this particular area. If you are deeply interested in this subject, do not let me put you off reading this book. If you have a more general interest in Wilson, I would suggest reading a different book."
4,Craig David's Female Counter,"Big ups to dis jazzy lil ting hailing from da UK! If you are feeling Craig David's vibe, you will enjoy this sassy lil lady. Lyrically solid, melodically balanced, genre melting, A Little Deeper stands to be one of the best albums of '03 (once released in the US). The album presents a nice mix of club hits like Crazy Crush, Dy Na Mi Te, and Feels So Good (Amazing); coupled with ballads like Brother and the title track A Little Deeper; and tracks to make you think Watch Over Them, Seeds Will Grow.This album recieves 4 star only because it is not a US selling album at this time, the extra cost is a little absorbant. Once released in the US this album will be a 5!"
2,Ended up giving this to my boyfriend.,"I was expecting more of the booty-shaking garage MC'ng I have come to love from Miss Dynamite...and what I got sounded more like something from Faith Evans or Deborah Cox. There's maybe 2 tracks where MD gets down and dirty, most of it is R&B. I was pretty darn disappointed, but my boyfriend loved it so I gave it to him. Don't expect much similar to her earlier work with So Solid Crew and other garage staples."
5,Really nice and easy to use,You can set a lot of different information on order to follow your exercise progress.The owncall feature is really amazing and helps a lot.
5,This is the real deal.,"I have tried many HRM watches and this one is the best in my opinion, it tells you everything you need to know at a glance once you get it all setup.Extremely easy to use and seems very durable."
5,"If you work out, you should get one of these","Knowing my heart rate while I am cycling/running/swimming has helped raise my fitness level. The watch beeps (which you can silence) when you are out of your target zone and keeps accurate statistics: calories, time, % fat burned, limits, average HR, etc. This will change the way you exercise for the better."
4,Good to excellent,"RS 100 works very well. Does everything it's advertised, easy to see and fits well. I would give it 5 stars but the buttons are not intuitive. It may actually have to many functions. It was easy enough to use AFTER I read the instructions."
2,Received...and working improperly,"It's new, purchased 10 days ago. The watch face turns black randomly, it depends on I dont know what. Whoww...Think twice before push enter (purchase)"
2,Misrepresented,This item was represented to have data download capability to a computer. it does not. I feel cheated.
4,Bad instructions,The reason this product did not get 5 stars is the instruction manual that came with the product. After several attempts to appropriately program the watch the heart rate info was inaccurate. It took an email to the company to learn of other functions an d programming that was not included in the enclosed instructions. Was on the verge of returning the item when we learned of the missing instructions. Now that it is properly programmed the product is working fine and is very much liked.
4,Works great!,"Was a little tricky to get used to the settings but works well keeping track of heart rate. I didn't need any ""bells & whistles"". Several years ago I had a Polar monitor and I like the improvements that have been made especially the detachable transmitter unit on the monitor strap which maximizes the trasnmitter battery lifetime."
2,Very Complicated,"I find it to be too complicated. I cannot readily change back to time and heart rate easily, even though the instructions say you can."
1,The transmitter is defective,"The transmitter is defective, I know because I checked with another watch I would like to send me another transmitter"
4,what happened?,Polar RS100 Heart Rate Monitor and Stopwatchi bougth this wacth and i want to know what this product doesnt get to the address i put
3,Polar sin la funcion mas importante,"Este modelo es buenisimo, pero le falta lo mas importante, oder calcular al terminar de entrenar con el toque de un boton, en un lapso de tiempo q uno programe (normalmente es 1 minuto) la recuperacionlograda despues del ejercicio( exactamente el numero de pulsaciones q desciende nuestro corazon en un minuto una vez parado el entrenamiento)Este dato es muy importatnte para medir los avances en aduision o perdida de condicion fisica"
1,This product do not have warranty by Polar,I received my RS100 HR Monitor and the monitor do not receive the transmitter signal. I was with my local dealer and when he knows that this Monitor was bought at Amazon he says that is not possible to have the replacement by warranty. This type of products should be buy at an authorized dealer.
2,Not so great,"This is a beginner heart rate monitor watch - designed by a beginner. Polar could learn a great deal about button layout from competitors.1. watch seems to have completely dropped the time and date reset. Set once, that's it? -can't adjust for Daylight Savings Time, can't change time zones? Pretty sad.2. testing the functions, can not reset to zero. Would be nice to begin each run with a clean 0:00 start point.Real disappointment, simply not too functional. Recommend buying something else."
5,HRM that actually works!,I had tried a timex hrm before this and it didnt even come close in accuracy. Even though the RS100 is a bit more than some of the timex models its well worth the money. It is accurate and simple enough to use. I would actually reccomend this one over the RS200 since that model seems to have more problems. The only gripe I had was the T31 chest strap which always felt like it was slipping down while I ran. Although my dog has recently destroyed the T31 transmitter and I am looking forward to getting the Wearlink chest strap which looks to be an improvement over the contemporary design. Apparently my dog didnt like the T31 either....
2,Not very accurate,"Tried out the HRM today without actually exercising.The transmitter is quite good and the watch picks up the heart beat in a heart beat!However the reading is not steady. My resting BPM ranged from 70-96. Within a matter of seconds it was jumping all over the place.The setup was quite straight forward and out of the box I had it all set up and ready to go within 5 minutes, without reading the manual.Will write an update once I have exercised with it."
4,Good but watch settings,I saw a few complaints about the Heart Rate reading too low...of course I Googled the question because mine (6 weeks old) had started reading in the 40's and 50's though I had not changed any settings. That said I found that they had changed (maybe a glitch in the chip that controls the thing..?) See info below from the manual..it was spot on and now my Polar RS100 is back to normal. I maintain I did not make any changes so look for other potential bugs to emerge.One more thing...a week after I bought this the price dropped significantly and when I called to get a credit for that amount I got nothing except a song-and-dance. Thanks AMAZON...BTW I am short your stock. BPKD**From Manual page 14** Note: You can review Timer settings (if activated) in Standby mode by pressing . Switch heart rate formats (heart rate as beats per minute or heart rate as a percentage of maximum heart rate; %HR) by pressing .
5,Great HRM for slightly more than a beginner,"This is my second Polar HRM. Being slightly more than a beginner I wanted an HRM that coule provide slightly more than the basics. The RS100 qualifies.Pros:Looks niceHas muliple features including personalization.Replacable baterries both for the watch and for the sensor.Polar user interfaceCons:History only for the last sessionPolar user interface (yes... for some it is a pro but if you are not used to it it is a real con).If you exercise often, care about your HR and being in the zone but not fanatic about tracking your data, this is a great, good priced solution."
2,Did not keep correct HR.,"Bought this and tried it several times and it would give me my correct HR. It said my resting HR was 40, actually 64 and never would register over 84 during good workout with actual HR at 120-130."
5,Heart Rate,The items came as advertised and faster than I had anticipated. I am pleased with the product. I highly recommend.
4,Nice quality and features for an entry level unit!,"Nice quality, display, appearance, etc. I'm pleased with the unit with one exception: I wish it would show time of day and heart rate on a single display. I should have examined the features more closely before buying."
4,Just what I needed !!,"I have had some another HR watches, but nothing like this, this is just great, I've been using is since the very first day, no problems so far, easy setup, ease to navegate thru all features.I use it most in my spinning class, also while I'm running and sometimes when I play outdoor soccer, it gives you an idea of your workout.Haven't try in the pool, I'm just afraid stop working, but I'll give a try once the summer comes:).If you are planing to buy a HR Monitor watch, this is one of the best options, Timex are good, but compare with the price this is much better.Sunnto watches are nice, but to small for me, and a little bit more expensive.I love my ""chaparrita""."
4,A satisfactory heart rate monitor with basic functions,"I was looking for a basic heart rate monitor after my Garmin 405 stopped working. There are other Polar models that have all the bells and whistles, but I was just interested in a stopwatch and heart rate display. The Polar RS 100 meets that need very well. It has basic functions like backlit display, lap timing, and upper and lower limits. After a couple months of use, the heart rate reading has been consistent.I like the comfort of the chest strap and the wristband is secure. I am satisfied with the RS 100."
4,Great first heart rate monitor,"This is my first heart rate monitor, which I use for running and cycling. It is pretty simple to use, fits great, and all components are hand washable. In addition to average heart rate, max and min, it tells you how many calories you've burned, and the percent of those calories from fat. You can also track your performance on laps, such as when you're doing intervals or speed work, but I haven't yet mastered that function.What this HRM lacks: A GPS to track distance and pace (I use the RunKeeper app on my mobile phone to do that), and the capability to transmit your workout data wirelessly to your computer. I enter that info manually into a training diary that I created on the Polar website. If that seems too tedious, you might want to spring for a more expensive model."
4,Good even for a newby,"This is my first heart rate monitor. Bought it after comparing reviews, and I'm not disapointed. It is easy enough to figure out, and the instruction manual helps you get there quickly with good illustrations and descriptions, and a layout that helps you find what you're looking for. I've used it while doing ligher weight supersets as a fatburning/toning exersize, to keep my heartrate within the zone. It is simple enough to use that I was able to read a few targeted pages in the manual, fiddle with it for about 5min, then go get started. So far I have not had any problems with the watch losing contact, except for the first trial-run when I didn't put any moisture on the electrodes in the band."
4,Good fitness computer,Quality product would recommend for anyone who wants to better understand what you doing while working out. Only con is no heartrate value display.
4,Good for trainning,"Excelent product, it arrived in very short term of time, just 4 days and under free shipping method. Polar has good trainning devices, they work very well. Haven't tried yet fully, just learning to use it. Havent swett it yet."
3,"Monitor is good, instructions are confusing","The monitor is a good value and appears to work, however, the instructions that were included were not useful. After looking up better instructions on the internet, we were able to use the monitor.Polar RS100 Heart Rate Monitor and Stopwatch. The heart rate does not match the medical monitor that my husband uses so we are not sure how accurate it is."
5,Awesome HR monitor,"This functions much better than the times I had previously. I really like that it will begin to display your hr before you actually start your workout. I don't use the calories burned function, but the avg hr and workout time give me exactly what I need. I definitely recommend this monitor."
5,Excelent Heart Rate!!,"I bought this heart rate to start my spinning sessions, it is very usefull and very simply to use it. I love it because told me everything that I need about my spinning sessions as quantity of calories and the % of fat used to burn that calories!!"
4,Well worth IT!,"After years on hesitation on buying this I finally did and love it! My husband purchased one and I saw how easy it was to use and accurate it was. So we have 2 in the house and have no complaints.Easy to use, sometimes it does not read the heart rate at first because you need to be a little sweaty for it to start reading but other than that it is great.Overall I love it."
2,It's a little confusing and a little annoying....,"I bought this heart rate monitor because it met my four requirements in a HRM: Polar, able to display HR as a percentage of max, backlight, and able to store a training session. In those areas, it's a stellar product. But the two things I don't like about this model are really annoying to me. It doesn't have a walk test, so it is difficult to program my zones. I can guess, but it doesn't feel right to me. Also, the beep it produces when you are not in the zone is obnoxious, and unlike my RS5, I can't turn it off. It gets the job done, and I'll live with it, but if I knew then....."
4,Very nice,"The monitor works very well and was very reasonably-priced.The only reason I am docking it a star is that the programming, control and navigation are not very intuitive."
1,polar,"this was new as advertised, but did not work. it appeared to need battery replacement which is a technical job that has to be done by a service center. i have sent it in & am awaiting a quote."
5,never run without it,The watch is awesome and the battery life lasts a long time. The strap is small and I quickly forget I am even wearing it. All the data seems to be very accurate.
1,I'm sticking to my old HRM,"My ancient polar S210 needed a new battery so I decided on a long overdue upgrade. Boy was I disappointed. The rs100 seemed to have all the features I was interested in, and the price was fair, but right out of the box, it never accurately recorded my heart rate, even when I used it with my old chest strap (which has always transmitted my heartrate accurately to my S210). The only good marks I can give this whole experience was that amazon.com has a very simple return process that made this ordeal nearly painless. I have since replaced my old S210 battery and watch band and am back in business."
4,run Forest... run!!,Works great. Super accurate. Easy set up and menu navigation. I should have purchased the model that also calculates my speed. Good buy nontheless. Monitor and strap are comfortable too.~Jeff
5,Great Product,"I really love this heart rate monitor! The only slightly negative thing I can say is that while it is unisex, it looks big on my wrist (I am a petite female). However, since female HRMs are smaller, it's hard (if not impossible) to find one that displays all the features that this HRM does. The fact that it is bigger makes it quite easy to read while running. And, you can toggle through the top line to display your lap time, time of day, or calories burned while you're using it. There's no way I could trade it for a female HRM.If you are a female, then my advice is to first decide whether you're okay with the larger watch (if it's any help you get used to the larger size after awhile). If so, then I highly recommend this one."
5,great starter watch!,I like this watch! It allows me to monitor my heart rate with percentages. Working out is more fun with this watch. It's also very easy to use.
3,Corrected Review - it is working ok,"I originally reported that my device was defective because it was showing wrong heart rate, it turned out it was showing percentage rather then the rate. I accidentally hit the lower right button to switch and didn't realize it.However it is not very stable, sometimes my rate would jump up to 220 for periods of time and then come back down...."
4,cannata,"Great cd but i must warn you, if you but it from cd baby it's a cdr. this cd is the same guy from Arc Angel,you will love it."
3,Where are the inseam measurements?,Even on Ebay they have inseam measurements. This would be a nice item at this price if it would fit correctly!
5,The Magical maker of music does it yet again!,"This is an absolutely incredible album with songs of the 70s made sooo much better. Whenever I hear these songs on the radio by the original artist I say, ""This song is so much better when Barry sings it."" Barry brings his own wonderful style to these songs, making it a listener's paradise."
3,Takin' me back,"Taking us all back if we were kids, teens or adults: This artist's versions will take you back to the 70s. Manilow is a little weak on some songs, but for the most part this is a likeable CD."
4,A Different Kind of Barry,"In the classic Barry Manilow style, the songs on this CD are well arranged and beautifully sung. A fun walk down memory lane, the songs are indeed popular tunes from '78 and were fun to hear again.I was, however, looking for a ""punch"" from Mr. Manilow. He is fabulous as a performer and can provide a bit more variety than he does on this CD. The songs seem to ""muddy"" together instead of each standing out on their own. As much as it hurts me to say it... he could have put a little more pizazz into it.Love ya Barry!"
5,One of the best Manilow albums to date!,"Barry Manilow puts some of my favotite songs from the 70s and performs them, in my opinion, better than the original artists. I'm looking foward to his next album."
3,THE ORIGINALS ARE BETTER,"Back in 1996, when I first purchased this CD, I thought, ""How great. Barry's doing some of the best songs of that summer!"". I listened and thought, okay, Barry, nice job. In listening to the CD over, however, I find that the only cover that compares to the original is his version of ""Never My Love."" However, his attempt at some others pale in comparison. ""Reminiscing"" is nowhere near as infectious as the Little River Band; his ""When I Need You"" and ""Air That I Breathe"" sound forced and strained; he can't touch the emotional delivery of Dan Hill's ""Sometimes When We Touch,"" and his loungish version of Firefall's ""Just Remember I Love You"" is downright embarrassing. I've always been a Manilow fan, and have defended him to friends many time on his schmaltzy-let's change the key ending ballads, but when he tries to do that to these songs, it just don't cook. Nice try, but overall disappointing."
3,"Sorry, not the best","I've been a fan of Barry since the beginning. The idea of the album is great, but I felt like I was listening to a lounge act singing old 70's songs. It's nice to reminisce, but this really didn't do anything for me."
2,The Seventies Not Quite As Good As You Remember It,"This album had a lot of potential. The songs were chosen from among those that might have been played beside Manilow's hits in summer of 78 (when he was at his commercial peak).But although Manilow's in fine voice, he is done in by the stringy, synthesized goop production of Michael Omartian, himself a producer of some of the 70s schlockiest hits (everything from ""Rock Me Gently,"" to ""Theme From SWAT"" to Christopher Cross). Manilow's version of ""I Go Crazy,"" is especially maddening; Paul Davis' hit version (a hit in 1978) sounded similar to Manilow's hits of the period."
1,ONE OF BARRY'S WORST RECORDINGS-DON'T BOTHER,"I DON'T KNOW WHY BARRY EVEN BOTHERED TO MAKE THIS RECORDING. HIS RENDITIONS OF THESE HIT SONGS FROM THE 70'S ARE TERRIBLE AND HIS SINGING VOICE DOES NOT SOUND UP TO PAR. I HAD ORDERED IT THROUGH A MUSIC CLUB AND MADE THEM GIVE ME A REFUND! ALSO, WHERE DID THE TITLE COME FROM? NOT ALL OF THESE SONGS WERE ACTUALLY RELEASED IN 1978!"
1,"Very disappointing album - dull, boring, and embarrasing.","I am usually a fan of Barry Manilow for over 20 years but this album is another one of his embarrasing CDs to date. His renditions do not add anything new to the original songs from the 70's. Hearing his versions of these songs make me want to hear the original artists' interpretations. Barry Manilow seem to have lost his touch of magic that was present in his albums 20 years ago. Today, he is satisfied to rehash old hits and unwilling to challenge his fans with new innovative music. Summer of '78 should never have been made."
2,"Sorry, but...","Even us Mani-Loonies must have to admit that this one is a dissappointment! What was he thinking? I have so much stuff that is heart-and-soul Barry, stuff you know he created with his foot on the gas pedal. He really let up on it on this one. He could have really taken those songs and made them his own, but it was like he couldn't quite take the reins so it all came out sorta...ordinary. Ouch. You have no idea how much it hurts me to say that! (much more than this review will ever hurt Barry!) I listened so hopefully to each track, waiting to latch on to just one I could love! (when it comes to Barry, you know I'm easy) Oh, well. One out of 14 ain't bad.Barry, call me if you'd like to defend yourself. I have an idea for a Barry ""40's songs from England... ""There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover...""Sorry. It's the end of the day and I get to go home in 5 minutes."
1,No!,"No, No, No. Do NOT take great hits and redo them. Ever. Anybody. If a song is already wonderful, why redo it? Don't want to hear your rendition, I want to hear the song that I love. I enjoy Manilow; he is a guilty pleasure I take pride in announcing, and his original songs are terrific. But this is a big no."
5,great for Radio stations,Brings worship to life.Is very instrumental and non-threatening to the average listener whilebringing glory to God at the same time!
2,"Dust Bunnies and Fur Babies Only, Please","We have hardwoods and a big dog that molts twice a year (blows her coat) so this was purchased just to pick up the seasonal Fur Babies that congregate within hours of vacuuming. The battery has a very short life but I can hit all of the corners before it is finished. Does not pick up cat litter well at all. Fur fills the small cup quickly. The cup is easy to clean, but you do have to touch fuzzy contents. The toggle type power switch is distant, awkward and snaps into the ""On"" and ""Off"" position -- if you have small hands it may take both of them just to turn it on and/or off. The attached crevice tool is a nice feature. We have had several Handheld Vacs and know their many limitations, this one does do the job i purchased it for. I gave it 2 stars because of it's very light duty, weak suction, short battery life, and awkward design."
2,Disappointed,"I'm afraid this vacuum was not powerful enough for my simple needs. It could not pick up any pet fur, nor could it remove cat litter or much of anything else from carpet. I realize small handhelds can't do as good a job as my big corded vacuum, but I expected more from this given the positive reviews. On the plus side, it is lightweight and appears to be easy to clean."
2,Battery life?,After charging for the recommended 16 hours...the battery lasted about 15 minutes! It's on its way back!!!!!!!
1,Junk,"It's a piece of junk. Suction opening poorly designed, so it doesn't pick up dirt well. Very difficult to put into and take out of the recharging base. Very poorly designed."
1,Suckless sucker for suckers,"It has very limited sucking power. We use it to suck up small dead insects in tight corners. That is about as good as it gets. The whole point of a vacuum cleaner is to suck. This one sucks, but only figuratively."
1,weak handheld vacuum,This is not the handheld vacuum to own if you have anything more than the lightest weight dust to clean up. The suction is very weak. I think there are just not enough volts to power it. No stars for it at all!
1,You May As Well Throw Your Money Into the Garbage,"I don't have this exact 1 but if it's anything like the red version (exactly the same style, but in red), then it's junk. I own the red 1 and it needs to be recharged WAY TOO OFTEN. You can't use it more than four times without having to fully re-charge it again. Once it gets weak, it won't suck small objects out of a semi-tight corner (like the crevasse between the rug and wall). Don't waste your money on Eureka products. When it comes to electronics, it's usually wiser to spend the few more dollars on the better brand than buy the cheaper one which will have to be replaced quickly."
3,gift,"this was a gift, i can't review it personally, but the recipients say they are using and enjoying it."
2,Crime and Punishment book vs. video,"i was dismayed at how far the movie strayed from the book. it was hard to follow when comparing to the book, peter lorre was badly miscast as raskolnikov and i was generally very disappointed in the movie."
1,Terrible,"I found this movie to be absolutely ludicrous. Peter Lorre is the only person speaking with a non english accent, and makes a somewhat absurd Raskolnikoff. Many details from the book are eliminated. The only good thing about this film is when the production becomes so bad as to be laughable-- then, at least, a small bit of enjoyment can be gleaned from this wreck."
4,Good ole exploitation fun!,"A good example of a 70s exploitation flick, but I say that in a good way. Fun, 70s girl power flick with some action, catfights, ""jive talkin"", and a bit of a lesson thrown in. Enjoy!"
3,Weeeellll! Can't say it was too bad.,"I have trouble with Ethan Thorpe's problem with the age difference. Most men like them young -- although I understood his hangup because of his ex.Indecisive, wishy-washy, hormones??? Naw! Just not thinking like a man. A man's attitude needs to be researched more for this type of book.Brittany Baldwin's gentle take-over of the son and grandfather was really great but she wants to let the hormones take over??? Not very mature --The ex was truly a bit of a witch. Made a good villian. Story not that bad just lacking somewhere. Still a decent read."
5,"ABSOLUTE, UTTER, SHEER PERFECTION!","The things that amazes me the most is the speed with which these people play their instruments and, still, maintain flawlessness! Moodswings is a mind-boggling group who is truly unique and will maintain that position for a long time! It just doesn't get any better than this bunch! Need to put some oomph into your life? Here it is!"
3,A Little Dissapointed,"After Moodfood, this album is a bit of a let down. Seems to be a little formulatic. The two songs that stand out are ""The Great Sound of letting Go"" and ""Redemption Song"", but even the latter reminds me a bit of ""State of Independence"" but not as good. The album is better than most out there, but if you know Moodfood like I do, you will be a little disappointed."
1,Screwback - lost,"I purchased these earings because my 4-year old daughter keeps losing earings. I understood that the ""screwbacks"" would not come lose. Unfortunatley this was not the case. They didn't last a week."
5,"""Brilliant""",A must for those who love dance & discipline ! A perfect mix of East & West which were'nt supposed to mix ?
2,turgid,"As much as I love ABBA it's always been pretty obvious that Agnetha and Frida - the singers - have been pretty clueless when it comes to their own material (the honourable exception being Frida's marvellous return album, 1996's ""Djupa Andetag""). ""That's Me"" only goes to show Agnetha is completely lost without Benny and Bjorn, as this 'best of' interminably demonstrates. Tacky, disposable, bland 80s pop is the order of the day here, and we'd all be no worse off without it. No wonder she hasn't bothered singing in more than 10 years."
3,"Good, but not great","This has 80's synthesizer sound all over it. While I love Agnetha's voice, I just can't handle alot of the songs on here. I realise her solo career was big in the 80's but this album is just too overkill. Alot of the songs do not do her voice justice. Luckily they have thrown in her ABBA vocal highlights which include the beautiful ""Slipping through my fingers"", and ""Winner Takes it All"".Don't get me wrong, there are still some treasures in this album - but it is ruined by the awful 80's sound."
2,I like Agnetha but....,"I agree that this album has that awful 1980's synthesizer sound to it. There is too much of the background sound and not enough of Agnetha's incredible voice. The only solo song of hers I really liked on here was ""Wrap Your Arm Around Me"". I agree with the person who suggested an ""Agnetha Unplugged"" album. I hope her album that is supposed to be coming out focuses more on her voice. I recommend this collection for die-hard fans only."
5,Great reference tool,I really enjoyed adding it to my reference collection. Helped me identify quite a few items in my collection.
2,u got to be kidding me,one was really good two just got away with it but 3! this is scary the cas has change and the plot is gone. Pleas go c #1. I gave it 2 stars for the cool dogs
1,Waste of time,"On a day when you've phoned in sick to work, only to realise you get very easily bored of lying on the couch, trying to sleep, the ideal thing would have been something light & fluffy.What exactly was the point in making yet another Beethoven? When the original cast refuse to come back, it should be easy enough to work out that the audience just isn't there. You've done, it's over. Particularly if you're just going to do the same story again. With a very annoying cast.I watched barely 20 minutes of this film, before realising I had a better selection in my DVD case than this. Shame it came packaged with the previous two, but I suppose I'll just have to put up with it."
3,the only good part,ha ha. this movie makes you fell sorry for that brennan kid. like the part when he's looking at the hello kitty stuff and the girl that he likes sees him.
4,Great Pleasure,"I take great pleasure in the ridiculous situations which arise in this family and the dog. They make me laugh. I find this dog pleasant and congenial, so I love every one of his films."
1,Roll over Beethoven,"Straight to video nonsense with Beethoven returning once again with a new batch of cutesy puppies. Wondering why the original cast are missing? Simple- the new family are their relatives and have been so kind as to take care of Beethoven.The only recognisable actor in the film is Judge Reinhold who plays the father in the family. Beethoven's 3rd is basically a film which trys to act as an improvement and replacement on the original Beethoven movie. In the end though, it just proves to be completely unnecessary and ridiculous."
2,"Strictly a family movie, but not fun to watch","I haven't watched the original Beethoven or its immediate sequel. This third installment is a big letdown. OK, maybe it's because I'm a grown-up. Kids did like it. But I found the acting amusingly terrible, esp. the phony performance put up by the wife. The kids are not even likable. The Penny girl is kinda pretty but not particularly convincing. The two villains are the bright spots besides the dog (or the three dogs that play Beethoven), but after about 60 minutes, nothing in this movie has any redeeming value left. I pretty much fast-forwarded the last 20 minutes of this 90-minute film."
4,Works well enough for the rpice,"I considered purchasing the pricier plastic lens polishing systems, which are offered, but decided to try this stuff since it was much cheaper and was highly recommended by others. I used it to polish the ten-year old headlight lenses on my van, which were very well scratched and oxidized so I could not see the lamps inside. But, after using this stuff with a regular shop rag, I was able to polish the lenses to where I could clearly see the lamps inside. Although, I was not able to get out the deeper scratches, It worked well enough for my purposes."
4,Plastic Cleaner,"I used this on plexiglass that I have on my desk. It worked better than anything else I have tried, but not as well as I was hoping."
4,Nice product,"GIves a nice polish. Works for fine scratches. Won't really do much for bad oxidation. You'll need polishing compound, at a minimum, for that. But for upkeep of plastic in good condition it seems to work well."
1,These ratings must be paid for,"This product did nothing for my car. I have tried all the plastic cleaners, and the only ones that work as advertise are the ones that require sanding. Save yourself the money and buy the 3M Headlight lens restoration system."
2,not the right item advertized,"I didn't know you had 3 differint types of the cleaner. This one if for very lite haze. You would need the one with heavy haze to fix the headlites the right way. I haven't even tried this yet, but know it won't work well."
3,Good stuff but need a sealant!,"Cleared up the headlights on my 05 TL, however I did not know that a sealant is needed after using the plastic cleaner and polish. Meguiar's cleaned up the headlight well but not great. I found out from reading reviews that a sealant is needed to keep the oxidation away. I ended up buying the Rain-X kit from Amazon. Huge difference after using the 3 step sandpapers and sealant. The plastic cleaner in the Rain X kit isn't as good as Meguiar's but the sealant makes a huge difference. So if you do buy this product, be sure to buy a sealant!"
2,"Polished for an hour, no improvement.",I washed my headlights and proceeded to polish with this product for an hour and saw no improvements. I will go back to the traditional method of restoration.
2,Not so great,Although this product seems to be rated highly by other buyers it fell way short of my expectations. My van is 5 years old and does not have severe discoloration but this product removed very little of it. I advise using one of the heavier duty products.
1,Did not clear 2000 Corolla headlamps well,"Brought PIAA bulbs for the car hoping to have brighter headlamps. PIAAs were brighter, but the haze/fog on the old headlamps really dull the light.Brought this hoping for a quick and cheap solution to fogging headlamp problem. Applied per instructions and it just cleaned the lenses but did not remove most of the fog. It is similar to the old turtle wax with a little bit of abrasives in the solution - cleans but not abrasive enough to take out the haze. A waste of money. I will try some chrome cleaner or silver polisher next. If that doesn't work, will just order replacement headlamps from Amazon.com; which is about 2x the price of the more expensive haze/fog removers. And those may not work either."
1,Did not clear plastic fading,I ordered this product to clear some fogging on a convertable vinyl window and it did not help at all. I was very dissapointed in it's performance.
2,Works about 50%,"This product did work... Some. I have a 2005 vow jetta out in California and the headlamps were pretty bad and one needed replacement. There my reference is pretty accurate. Comparing the 'repaied' with the new, this product only restores to about 50% of the original. This might be acceptable to simply improve 2 existing but looks obviously different aside a new headlamp."
2,Plastx not reccomended,"I tried it on my 2002 Lexus gs 300 and the results were not very good. I followed the exact directions that came with it. They improved but only for a few weeks-then they were cloudy again. Finally, i paid Lexus dealer $200.00 to do it with a product called BG. The result was very good, and 3 months out it continues to look very good. I do not reccomend Plastx, unless your headlights are mildly fogged. The BG is far better."
4,Works pretty well for me. Worth trying.,"It works pretty well for me and is easy to use. It does need to be applied and then buffed off properly. It is not expensive, so it is worth trying. From what I have heard, headlights can also be fogged on the inside, and of course it would not help for that. Consumer Reports says that the Sylvania and 3M restoration kits are the best, so I may try one of those. The Meguiar's is cheaper, easy to use and definitely worth a try. I use one lint-free cloth to apply it and a clean one to buff it."
2,Did nothing for my headlamps,"This product did not improve the clarity of the hazed headlamps on my 1997 Dodge Caravan. At least it did no harm.P.S. The product that did the trick was ""CCP 5 Minute Headlamp Lens Restorer"""
1,USELESS!!!,"i was excited to buy this product hoping it will clean my 2003 taurus' headlight shield but alas it didn't do a thing. all the advertisement that it will make the headlight shield look brand new is exagerated. don't buy this item, save your money or try another brand. and for my rating that should be 0 star not 1 star, i just accidentaly clicked the mouse......"
1,Two thumbs Down,I like this brand of auto wax so I thought I'd give this a try. Very dissapointed in the results. Doesn't work as well as another product I used a few years earlier and I'll have to search for that one again at my local auto parts store.
1,Works but there is much better out there! Buy Plexus,"This product worked just ok for my vehicles. In all honesty we want things done now and the best possible way and this just wasn't working. I suggest using Plexus cleaner, it is the best and used by the best. A little pricey but it works like no other. I love Meguiar's products and I use their waxes and soaps but when it comes to plastic cleaners use Plexus. It'll take you less than a minute per headlight to get the yellow out and look brand new."
1,Not as magical as reviewed,"I bought this product based on the number of 5-star positive reviews. I tried it on 4 separate cars ( ages of 16 years old, 11 years old , 8 years old and a 1-year old), that are both garaged and left outdoors in the mild, wet winters and the smoking hot, humid summers of Southeast Texas. The headlights were washed and dried before the PlastX cleaner was applied. The three oldest cars were tested first. From oxidized and foggy to perfectly clear? No, so not worth any stars. Any positive improvement? maybe 1/2 a star. This product did not help the aging oxidized headlights as previous reviews have suggested. The last headlights tested were on a 2009 honda van. They weren't damaged or faded, so there wasn't anything to notice except that it does work as a polish."
3,Not as good as I thought,"This product did clear the headlights on my car a little but it did not provide crystal clear shine. However, I use this product after each car wash to protect the headlights from UVs. I will try other brand next time."
4,Not Bad- Glad I Ordered,"The covers on my headlights were pretty bad. I noticed on the back of the bottle that there are three different strengths based on the condition (bad to worse!) of application. Had I known that, I would have probably ordered the type of product meant for hideously hazed plastic.I spent maybe 10-15 minutes on each headlight cover- it didn't get all of the haziness out, but definitely got most of it. There was a HUGE difference in the cover I finished and the one I had yet to start. I'm really pleased with the results. Granted, had I purchased the extra strength type, it may have gotten a little more off with a little less elbow grease, but for $5 (compared to the $20 stuff I saw in the store today) I don't have any complaint. I'm hoping that another few go arounds will remove the remaining haze marks."
2,Used on an oxidizing headlight...,"I used this product a few times on one of my headlights that was starting to oxidize and it covered up the problem, but within a few washes and a few more applications, it actually made the oxidation worse. Maybe I used it incorrectly, I'm not really sure, but I haven't used it since. That headlight was eventually restored by a professional and then replaced as it got damaged in an accident. I do like Meguiars products, just not this one. My other headlight is starting to look a little shabby and I decided to use Ultimate Compound by Meguiars and it has done a much better job. I also used it on my girlfriend's and dad's headlights and the Ultimate Compound really cleared away the oxidation. I then followed that with some carnauba wax, very nice."
2,fAIR,"This cleaner is nothing special. I applied it several times and I could not see a difference in the lens quality. It did remove a few spec of road grime. My freind gave me a product from walmart, that really worked well. So I went and purchased it. Applied it again. What a difference. You can purchase several cleaners products at Walmart for 1/2 the cost of Meguir's. Meguiar's Clear Plastic Cleaner is not worth the premium price you pay for it."
5,Good stuff,This stuff really works. buy this if you want plastic to really shine and it brings the best out of the covering.
5,Worked for me,"Worked on my 2005 honda accord. Had faded lens, and cleared up my headlights super fast. Couldn't be more happy."
3,not very durable,"Before this product, I was using Meguiar's 2 part plastic polishing kit on almost everything- from CD's, computer monitors, watch screens, gps, etc. So after one of the bottles (meguiar's 10) ran out, I decided to try this product, as it was advertised as a one step cleaner-polish. While it did do the job of cleaning things up, I found that the polish portion of PlastX did not necessarily fill in the fine scratches quite as effectively as the standalone Meguiar 10 polish. Not only that, but the protective coating wore off after a few months, returning the headlights to it's post sanded haze.So bottom line is, only use this kit if you plan on doing plastic restoration on a continual basis. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Meguiar's 10 + Meguiar's 17 as a more potent, long-lasting combo."
5,Clear Headlights,"This product works very well on lightly scratched or yellowed plastic lenses. If the lens is really bad, it will first need to be wet sanded. I worked up from 380 to 2000 grit. After finishing off with PlastX my headlights looked like new. Overall this stuff works great, and if the plastic isn't to badly neglected it works fine by it's self. It also seems to leave behind a wax which beads off water and protects the plastic. I highly recommend this product."
4,Great product,"Performs well at removing oxidation and light scratches. If your lights are stained on the inside, this may not help as much."
4,It really WORKS!!!!,"Well, I was skeptical just like most of you. But, someone told me that my car would look so much better if I were to clean my headlights. Prior to then, I'd never thought about it. So, I went to Walmart and started looking around. I saw a few different varieties. I googled the reviews on my i-phone and saw that this product had so many reviews. Some favorable and some not. But, the majority were favorable. So ... $5.97 later I took it home. I gave some to my younger sister for her car and I kept some for myself. Later that evening, my my other sister and I applied it to my car (actually she did it). And I couldn't believe that it actually worked. It truly was like MAGIC! I'd recommend it and I hope this helps someone like the reviews I read helped me :-) Good luck"
5,great for plastic windows,I bought this to use on plastic windows that I have in my sun porch. I clean them with a spray cleanaer to get the heavy dirt off then use the plastic cleaner and polish. They almost look new again.
2,whatever,"I got tired of seeing the commercials and wondering if these products really work. Now I know, they help a little, but do not restore the lense to perfect like they claim. It did make the light seem brighter, but the lense still looks old and dull, not like the one on the other side."
5,Amazing Product - Works GREAT !!!!,"Amazing Product that works great, removed the oxidation from the headlight lens,I also used the product on the rear tail lights as well gives both front and back lens a great new look."
2,Zymoil works better.,I tried this product after the 3M lens restoration kit to get the lense even clearer and it didn't help at all. I had some Zymol cleaner wax and it was much better. Amazon even sells Zymol.
3,Well done but trench warfare is handled in a shallow way,"The colourization is well done despite the improbably ginger mustache of Ludendorf and a pale blue (only) Union Jack. The repetition is often irritating. Delville wood and Pozieres are NOT mentioned with Vimy ridge only in passing. The commentary on the trench warfare tends to be of the ""donkeys"", ""butchers and bunglers"" and "". . . . planless, gutless lot of buffoons"" persuasion - Haig was the best of them all but was still an employee subject to sanction and in the beginning was starved of munitions and man power. Remember the northern section of the front was only 2 or 3 days march from the channel coast (Dunkirk etc). Haig DID NOT declare war, DID NOT invade Belgium, DID NOT destroy large tracts of France but he DID hold the show together between the French mutiny and the arrival of the Americans."
2,"Visually interesting, aurally irritating","The presentation of computer enhanced b&w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library, legacy of my father. However, the aural commentary of Brannagh was repetitive and boring, each episode basically repeated the same 6+ octagenarian survivors exact same comments and reflections."
4,"Touching story, excellently acted","I bought this DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie from some of the actors in it. I was not disappointed. Bob and Julie (Alun Armstrong and Lindsey Coulson) somewhat reluctantly open their home to two girls from Belarus who are suffering from the effects of the Chernobyl disaster. In the process they all learn different ways to respond to life's glitches. The young actors are both excellent, particularly Anna Krippa who plays the demanding role of Nelli, who besides dealing with language and cultural difficulties must also learn how to live in a loving and supportive home. The movie is just over an hour long, and could have benefited by a longer running time allowing a more in-depth look at motives. If there had been more exposition and character development, I think I would have given this 5 stars."
2,Where are the Children ( VHS ),"The movie was great,in some part's of the movie and at the end of the movie there was alot of the part's of the movie you could not see, the tape was damage in some part's.You could not see it or make out what it was.If there had been a part here and there,then I would haved rate this alittle better.I know that my kid's watch VSH movie's all the time.They have over 300 VSH tape's, and these tape's are old. We have had these when my kid's where born, my son is 21 now and my little girl is 14 years old. And these tapes still work like new."
1,Flat,"Domingo needed to sight read his music. Brightman was only average. The other ""stars"" actually sang FLAT! I could not believe my ears. When I played the DVD everyone in my living room said the same thing. They sang FLAT! A huge let down. The choice of music was less than exciting and the arrangements were not suited to the performers. Merry Christmas"
4,MUITO BOM,"Este DVD é ótimo para assistir em uma reunio com a Família, ou até mesmo sozinho. Gostei."
2,Sad :((,"When I read the first reviews, I could not (did not want to) believe them. Unfortunately they were true. It is sad that these great performers could not produce a more 'festive' concert. I am glad I did not pay to see the concert. Unfortunately, Sara, Pla...D, etal, will never see these reviews."
3,OK; For true blue fans only,"Its worth adding to your library only if you are a true blue fan of any of the singers. The orchestration sounds great in Dolby Digital 5.1 on a surround sound system. However the mix of the singers' voices could be better. Domingo is overpowering, Sarah. B is just right, and its difficult to understand Lotti and Cocciante at times. Sarah B. does a credible job with what she has to work with. Domingo's voice just doesn't work in this setting. Lotti sounds OK. I'm not sure what the big deal about Cocciante is. His voice sounds like gravel. A bad day?(Can't tell I've never heard him before.) Overall, just an average performance."
2,a gala christmas in Vienna,"Without mincing words, an unexpected dissapointment. Domingo is charming as always and the aging of his voice on this disk is very distinct, although in no way unpleasant. Brightman's performance is very credible and the audio production values, which were very poor on my copy, seemed to favor her more than any of the others. Lotti, so often versatile and acrobatic in his approach on other disks seems flat and clouded here. Cocciante is an annoying presence on this disk and his voice does not blend well at all with the other three...a marketing risk that did not pay off. I can only assume that all the performers, in retrospect, would prefer that the disk had never been released. Had I known about the non-traditional repertoire I might have been better prepared for the dissapointment...there was not a single number in which I was emotionally transported."
1,How I hate this book,My Teacher read it to us in class. It sounds in exciting but I don't think it was the greatest. The author should make the story happen quicker and she should have less characters so they'res less to concentrate on. Also think that the author should have more then one problem then of them being stuck in a snow cave.
3,Great and terrible at the same time,"You know how you just can't pull your eyes away from a train wreck? LDG is a lot like that. It's embarassingly bad in a few spots, but really a fine movie that really keeps you hanging on until the end. Keaton, like Allen, has her mannerisms that are occasionally like fingernails on a chalkboard, but she does a fine job in this movie. The supporting cast is really tremendous. I just wish that someone else had played the lead. Sig Weaver, perhaps? No, she could never have made naive believeable enough. Oh, well. . . . . someone."
4,Kept me interested,"This movie kept me interested, I really wanted to see how Charlie was going to pull it all off."
4,micast,"diane keaton is normally a limited actress but here she is simply micast. a fine actress would be needed to make the main character believable but miss keaton is not up to it. that being said, the rest of the film is quite good, especially klaus kinski. i hope for the making sometime of ""honourable schoolboy"" as ""tinker, tailor"" and ""smiley's people"" are superb. also, how about the len deighton trilogy ""game, set, match""?. saw ""berlin game"" on public tv years ago and it was first-rate."
1,YIKES,"I was surprised at how dopey this movie was -- I mean, right from the beginning. But then, it wasn't made yesterday -- it was made 20 years ago. I guess nowadays we demand a far more detailed setting for a flick involving Middle East intrigue. It felt so much like a standard issue TV episode from the early 80s that I kept expecting to see a commercial break. I swear I've seen episodes of Gilligan's Island that outperform this film in terms of suspense and plot development."
4,The Little Drummer Girl,"I really love this movie, although I have to admit I didn't catch the entire plot until I turned on closed captioning on my TV. A lot of the words are just too garbled to understand. My one big complaint about the movie itself is the casting of Diane Keaton. This isn't a criticism of her looks since I think she's very attractive, however for the role she was playing they needed someone who was very pretty in order to be convincing. She does do a magnificent job of acting the part.This movie is one the most romantic I have ever seen. Although there are only a few romantic areas in it, they are enough to carry the whole thing and make your your knees go weak. I became an instant Yorgo Voyagis fan after seeing this.The plot is excellent and carries you through to the end. I recommend this movie very much."
4,Diane Keaton at her best!,Superb acting and action! A must see for history and espionage buffs. Closed captions would be nice to have in a down streamed movie.
5,The best Le Carre story,"If you enjoy Le Carre's work, you will certainly enjoy The Little Drummer Girl. It's my favorite. Eighteen Total Words."
5,movie from book,I read the book years ago and then saw the movie. Wanted to see it again and so I bought it.It was just as good this time as when I saw it the first time. Not disappointed at all.
4,Awesome Techno!!,"Track Listing:01. Oh Yeah! (Final Fury Mix) 5:0002. Oh Yeah! (Pressure Mix) 5:1503. Oh Yeah! (Dark Treatment Mix) 4:0004. Axiom 7:0505. No Control 4:04If you like techno this should be right up your alley. This single features remixes of the song ""Oh Yeah!"" by Niko. If you never heard this song b4 they have a different mix on 'Killer Techno'. This cd also includes the ""Axiom"" & ""No Control"" song. It seems like the cd is being sold fairly cheap so if you got several dollars, pick this up!"
3,Sanding Sugar,This was less sugar than I was expecting. 4 oz is barely enough for rolling one batch of cookies.
1,Sanding Sugar,Way overpriced. I received a VERY SMALL amount - only 4oz. I will not be ordering this product from this company again.
3,"Good stories, not-so-hot writing","The other reviews describe the book's contents well. The stories are entertaining and educational, but Walsh's writing style struck me as not-quite-ready-for-prime-time. Many stories ended abruptly (perhaps a lousy editing job?) and the prose seemed like something out of a college-level creative writing class.I like Jeffrey Steingarten's books better...a matter of personal taste.Still, I give this 3 stars because the stories are excellent-- it's the storytelling that needs work."
3,Average at best,"After reading the many positive reviews (both Amazon and other sources) of this book, I was excited to begin my reading. However, both the prose and much of the subject matter left me cold.Mr. Walsh often appears to be trying too hard to ""grab"" the reader with subject matter that is both arcane and uninteresting.Those interested in fine culinary writing would be better served by authors like Alan Richman (GQ food writer), Jeffrey Steingarten (Vogue), or James Villas (Town & Country)."
2,Bad job by Fleer,"I already have this set but was just looking to maybe get another Griffey, Johnson, Biggio, or Smoltz rookie. I got a bad box though. The majority of the cards in the box I got were badly cut and had other nicks on the edges. Overall I liked the design of this set, unfortunately I got a box that Fleer should have just dumped."
3,They'll do.,The feet on these tights are very baggy. They bunch up with ballet slippers and do not look good. They will work until I can find a better pair. Price was good.
4,Confusion Clarified,"This was a text of mine, as a freshman, in college. It greatly influenced my own thought and action. for years my thinking was clouded, didn't know exactly what i should do in life. Books and words rang true but without knowing the action I needed. Forty, a good forty, years later, I knew what I was to do. It was too late for me,but I hope those around me will show the world how to direct their own thougts and actions in their lives and the lives of others. gmb"
3,Not the book I thought I was ordering,"The book I got was in very good condition, and arrived quickly. However, it was not exactly the same Book that I thought I was ordering, which was ""Language in Thought and Action"". The book I got was ""Language in Action"" published 1941."
1,The book itself is Propaganda,"If you like to know the definition and segmentation regarding linguistics, not the meaning and influence of language. Then this book is for you. Elaboration on symbolization, on context and connotation, on three parts on understanding - verifiability/inferences/judgments... etc. Unfortunately, those segmentation is merely for easy to analyze language and not grip language itself. Besides, take every arguments by granted, rather than convincing examples or comparsion. Pop books, like Steven Pinker's books.Recommedation:1. The new rhetoric by Perelman2. AristotleYou might not like their ideas on langauage, however, their wisdom are quite inspiring and helpful for your understanding of this field."
2,Great Disappointment,"The 5th edition of ""Language in Thought and Action"" is not the book that S.I. Hayakawa wrote in the forties. It is an impotent, edited-for-television, politically correct version of the brilliant original for which publisher and editors should be ashamed.For anyone who cares about language and its uses, I recommend that you track down the 1st edition. It's still around.Rowan Wolf"
3,Could be much better,"I read this book when I was in graduate school. I loved the book and still have an older edition. I just received the 5th edition. I have not yet had a chance to read it thoroughly, but the first thing that I have noticed is that it is a much smaller book and has omitted a chapter that made a very important point. That chapter was in the older editions. ""Red Eye and the Woman Problem"" taught a valuable lesson about cooperation and how the lack of it can stifle progress. I bought the book to expose my grandchildren the lessons in the older books. It is, no doubt, a very good one, but I am highly disappointed that very important chapter, and possibly more, was omitted from the 5th edition."
5,Everyone should read this book,This is an oldie but goodie brought up to date. An intelligent commentary on the uses of language to influence our lives. Clearly written with insight and humor. Real food for thought and even more meaningful in the age of information technology than when it was first published.
2,Needs a serious update,"The book is frequently referenced in journalistic writing. The book was good for professional writers 50 years ago, and it is very lacking in depth, offers too little examples, refers too little to linguistic theories, and does not analyze more recent, great writings."
5,Fascinating book!,"This book was one of my textbooks for English when I was a senior in high school in 1959-60. Looking back on 40+ years of an international career, it was probably the most meaningful book I ever studied in school, whether secondary, undergraduate or graduate. The proper use of language -- and semantics -- is very underrated in society today, as is the effect of nuances and different meanings on others. The edition following this one (1949) is even better, and includes unforgettable articles such as ""Two Views of the Bomb,"" that illustrate graphically how human beings can have very different views when witnessing the same event."
5,Thoughtful and Informative,"Language In Thought and Action by S.I. Hayakawa, updated by Alan Hayakawa, is a treasure of clear thinking and analysis of how language is used in our society and world. Wonderful for people who are skeptical of politicians and institutions of power. I appreciated the insights on words are just symbols, they do not mean anything by themselves ""The word is not the thing"", is a phrase used repeatedly in the book. Also appreciated was the insight ""Words change their meaning every time they are used"". Think about most words used by those in power - ""freedom"", ""democracy"", ""rights"", etc. Many of these hot-button words mean exactly what the speaker wishes them to mean, and nothing else."
2,Not what I expected,"Although some of his pronounciations come as a surprise to me, the point was to educate myself. However, I disagree totally with the Amazon review which stated that he provides useful information. The author is so intent on being ""clever"" that the history or trends regarding the usages of the words is ignored.I think it was a waste of money."
2,Not as good as it seems,"It is not as good as it seems, particularly for two reasons:-first, it does not use the regular phonetic code/key (the same dictionaries use), which makes it difficult at times to understand what the author meant;-second, it is not accurate for some words: it says that only one pronunciation is correct, although dictionaries and other reference books accept more than one pronunciation as standard."
2,Collar Review,"This is a great idea, and I love the collar. But for the price we paid it is not up to standard. It has already almost faded completely and we have not even had it for a month, it has faded so bad that it is even white in some places. I would not by this product from this seller again, but I am still going to try and find a nice saints collar. Like I said love the concept, but for quality it should be cheaper, or for the price the quality should be better!!"
2,expensive,This product is expensive and not packaged well. I received them in pieces.The nails need to be shrink wrapped prior to packaging.
3,Cover Image,"(I'm not actually rating this item, but the web page makes me pick something.) Amazon US is too lazy to post the cover image, but you can view it at amazon.co.uk."
3,GOHAN VS. FRIEZA,"In contrast to what one of the viewers above said, Gohan is stronger that vegita at this point because when gohan hit frieza he got hurt. Vegita hit him w/ a strong blast and didn't get a scratch. This video is pretty good though"
3,All Videos,"The new dub's of dragons balls z are really cool but the voices are so horrible Bulba sounds like a 17 year old 69er, Krillin sounds like he's gay, and don't get me started on King Ki's voice. The Names of the episodes give the whole thing away!! but overall I really liked it and so i'm giving it a 3."
5,Love these,I really think these bars are perfect before a workout or before ballet class. I am in really good shape.
2,"Works, but Just Purchase A New Scanner for Less","This document feeder works well; it comes automatically attached to the Microtek ScanMaker 5950. You can buy the Microtek Scanmaker 5950 for less than you can buy this attachment. So while this is a good unit, you can buy the unit and a scanner for less than the unit. Do that instead."
4,not made in USA,"I thought crayola was still made in the USA, I was very disappointed that these were not. It is my own fault though. They are fun to play with and they came on time, so I really can't complain."
3,Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,"This is how I feel about Charlie and The Great Glass Elevator. It was interesting because Charlie + his family + mr. Wonka had an adventure in outer space, but the story did not turn out to be how I thought it would be. I thought Charlie would invent a new type of chocolate to sell. It was a good book but I think Roald Dahl could add a little more pictures."
3,"Enjoyable, but not a must-read.","This is the sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory......and I'm afraid I didn't like it as much, probably because what happens to Charlie and his family and Mr. Wonka is much more far-fetched. And what I enjoyed in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was precisely that however extraordinary, everything was plausible, or at least very close to.In this book, our eight protagonists shoot to the stars in Mr. Wonka's glass elevator, and are mistaken for terrorists by astronauts in a space shuttle. Then they have to fight monsters called Vermicious Knids (sound the K), and when they finally get back down to the Chocolate Factory, the story shifts to something totally different... but closer to the style of the first book, therefore more to my liking: Wonka-vite, the rejuvenating pills.So yeah, it's enjoyable, but I wouldn't call it a must-read."
2,Weird,"If you REALLY liked the ""Charlie and the Choclate factory"" Then I recomend it. But if you though it was ""okay"" then the sequil, you might not enjoy. It is REALLY weird."
5,I hope Steven Spielberg buys the movie rights!,"I was looking through the Amazon.com books section for children and young adults, searching for just-slightly-past-Christmas presents for my niece, when I made an amazing discovery. For 24 years I have wondered just how Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Willy Wonka and the rest got back to earth after the great glass elevator left the building, and suddenly a way to answer my questions was at hand! After buying ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" for my niece, I ordered ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"" for myself. Once again Roald Dahl succeeded in creating a work so vivid that it creates a picture in your mind better than a movie (because you can go to the snack bar and not miss any action). This is a wonderful book for children with imagination (even the 35 year olds). If you've always wondered what happened next, this is a great way to answer those nagging questions."
2,Dahl was coasting when he wrote this,"The publishers must have demanded a sequel, so this is what Dahl came up with. Slow, repetitious, and not very imaginative.The glass elevator goes up-up-up. So what will come next? It will go down-down-down. The grandparents take pills in order to get very, very young. What will happen next? They take pills to get very, very old, of course. But not without alot of repetitive dialog to make the whole story last longer. Ugh.We both loved some of Dahl's other novels for their creativity and heart (for example, The BFG), but this one feels almost like it was written by someone else. Maybe kids will like reading this book to themselves, but reading it aloud to my daughter was a chore."
4,Should have been a series,"Even though I didnt enjoy this book as well as the first one, it was very cute and interesting. Roald Dahl should have had a series of ""Charlie"" books for us to enjoy. Adults as well as children will enjoy this book as a follow-up to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."
4,Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,"The book Charlie And the Great Glass Elevator is a great book. When Charlie, his family, and Mr. Wonka go in a ride in the elevator the glass elevator gets too far up. It ends up in space. Then they see a space hotel and want to link up with it. When they get onboard they have a feast, but as soon as they eat, ""knids"" start appearing one by one, and start to spell ""SCRAM."" Find out what happens to them by reading this great book ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator."""
4,Great Story,"It is a great story, with my favourite part being the part where the Glass Elevator went into space.Even though it wasn't as good as the first story(Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)It is a great story all the same."
1,Cruel and offensive,"We recently finished ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as a readaloud to our five year old daughter. What a cruel disappointment to read this book. By chapter three, we were all bored. And as a parent, I thought the characters were unusually mean as they spoke to each other. By chapter four, the ""President"" was racially stereotyping other cultures. As the parent of a Chinese child, I couldn't even bring myself to read aloud the Chinese Prime Minister's dialogue (for example: ""Gleetings, honorable Mr. Plesident"" and ""Excuse pleese, Mr. Plesident. You make big mistake.""Needless to say, we didn't finish chapter four, and we won't be finishing the book."
1,What was the point of that?,"While it's true that CHARLIE AND THE GREAT GLASS ELEVATOR picks right up where CHOCOLATE FACTORY left off, it does not continue on the same fun-filled path. There are adventures in space, a fight with an alien species, and many other senseless adventures which may work well in another children's story (or stories, since many of them do not work well in the same story). There is no central, cohesive plotline. There are no lessons or morals. The most glaringly absent item from this book is the sweetness and charm of its predecessor.I'll not read this again nor will I recommend it to anyone of any age."
5,This book is awesome!,"Actually, in comparison with the first book (Charlie and the chocolate factory) this book is definitely not as good. I did however read it in 2 days because I wanted it to be done in a matter of time for school, and, I couldn't put it down. This book does not have as much adventure because it's in space and then taking wonka vites and Vite Wonkas and so on and so forth. This book did keep your attention and of course, was written by roald dahl which makes it superior."
3,Could be better.....,"It's not as good as the orginal book.And it had phases used in the movie,that were never used int he first book.And it takes place right after they arrive at Charlie's home to go back to the factory.There is no Veruca,Violet,Mike or Augustes in this book.Violet is mentioned a couple times though.There are aliens trying to take oer the world,and Willy Wonka and company stop them.It has explores Charlie's family,unlike the book."
3,Good but not great,"This book was good but not great. My son and I read together and we liked it but it was not as good as the first book. It was a very strange trip through wonka world. Not gripping, but interesting."
4,"Quintessentially, Willy Wonka!","I had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I am a big fan of the movie, Willy Wonka, it is also one of my pre-schooler's favorites. We read Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator together, one chapter each night, and it was wonderful. It picks up right where the movie (and I assume the book) leaves off. The story was slightly inferior to The Chocolate Factory, hence the 4* rating, but nonetheless it was very enjoyable and well-written."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Not as good as the original.The takeoff into the Sequel of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is ok, but the rest doesn't live up to it, unfortunately.You can save the kids this one and go for some of Dahl's other work, or just go through the first book again.The space mission here isn't as much fun and doesn't offer as much clever commentary as the other book."
1,Don't read this book!!,"Much unlike the wonderful first book,Charlie and the chocolate factory, this book was horribly boring, and I had trouble not falling asleep while reading it.This book is definitely not one you'd want to read."
2,When Charlie Bores Me!,"OOOOOOPS!!!! WENT TO FAR!!!!When The Great Glass Elevator goes too far,there are some problems.They're being attacked by Vermicius Knids and there is a commuter capsule on their tail!! When they finally get back to The Chocolate Factory, Grandma Josephine, Grandma Georgina and Grandpa George are too lazy to get out of bed. Who (or what) will make them get out of bed?This book is recomended for people who like astronomy and crazy things. It is appropriate for kids from 8 to 10 years old. I gave this book two stars because I think that it is too crazy and not very interesting. For example: I don't much enjoy stories about aliens that invade space hotels. How can glass be Knid-proof?"
3,Charlie and The Great glass Elevator,This book that i reviewed is called Charlie and The Great Glass Elevator. The author of this book is Dahl Roald. My favorite character in this book is Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka is my favorite character because he was alway surprising and he never got worried when he got in to difficult sistuations. This book took place in space and the Chocolate Factory . I didn't learn anything from this book because it had crazy adventures. I would recommended this book to people who like crazy adventres.
1,PUTS ALL LITERATURE TO SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was the stupidest book that I have ever read,it had no imagination,it was totally confusing,and the plot kept on shifting. It made me wonder if Roald Dahl was sober when he had written this book. It sure doesn't seem that way. the point where the book totally lost me and convinced me that it wasn't even worth a 1 was the chapters in which we see what is going on in the white house! this book was totally stupid,and should never have even been published. it is a complete waste of time,and does not even hold up to the mavelous companion,published before it! mr. dahl: what were you thinking?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
3,it's good,"Here's what my 4 and 6yr old have to say about it. We just finished it after reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which they loved. They liked this one less than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but they still looked forward to reading it every night. It's true that it got boring when the characters floated around in space for so long, but they liked the part when the grandparents ate the pills--it led to a lot of mathematical calculations about how old their parents would be depending on how many pills we ate (each one makes you 20 yrs younger). Recommended!"
4,Willy Wonka in Space,"I really didn't know if I would enjoy this book as much as the first since the first half of the book is spent in outer space and not at the Chocolate factory. But once they do return to the factory, it picks up again. I still recommend this book, but the original is far superior. I don't know if I liked how selfish this book made Charlie's grandparents seem. This shouldn't be turned into a movie"
4,Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator Genesis R.,"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is a very funny book. I really recommend it. It's about Charlie's family go into a glass elevator and end up into space. In the story there is a president which is really dumb. Any kid of any age would really like it . If, you get this book I really hope you enjoy it."
5,Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,"It is really great!! Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Willy Wonka and everyone else go on a greater adventure right where they left off in the end of Charlie and the Choclate Factory. They enter a new hotel in space called Space Hotel U.S.A.! Well, don't want to tell you anything else."
2,A boring book!,"This book is not that good. Because there aren't too many things happeningin the begining. And then it just switches subject and another thing happens instead. Somrtimes it's very funny but when it's not funny, it's a very boring book.However the characters in the book are guite good. My favorite character is mr. Willy Wonka. He is very funny and he's never scared.I don't recommend this book to anyone, but if you want to read it it is better to read ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" first."
1,No,It was very boring.All that happened was them being out in space.It wasn't even very exiting when they got back to the chocolate factory and had trubles with the Wonka Vite pills.
1,Exceptionally Disappointing,"After having read Charlie and Chocolate Factory after seeing the movie based upon it, I was happy to discover that there was a sequel. I immediately checked this book from the library and started reading it right away. Needless to say - I was very disappointed.The plot of book is, truthfully and bluntly, quite stupid. It was sequel made for the purpose of having sequel. Don't waste your time reading this book."
3,a scattered sequel,"The sequel is more scattered than the original with some nice moments, but not as many as the first book, and it doesnt hang together as well."
3,Pretty Good.,Nice piece of material but I would reccomend buying one of his great big books so you can sit down by the fire and read all day.
1,Not worth reading,"Because my children dearly loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I could not have been more delighted to find a sequel. I bought it as soon as I discovered it, and proceded to read it to my daughter. My son then proceded to read the book himself.As I read it to my daughter, we were both very disappointed. We had hoped to discover what happened as Charlie learned about running the Chocolate factory and ultimately how he took over. Instead, we found some sort of a creepy science fiction type of story, complete with very frightening aliens. Neither one of us enjoyed the book very much.My son read the book and had nightmares about the aliens for months afterwards. He wrote a book report on it and stated that he did not like the book in his report. (I wonder why?)While I certainly recommend the first book, I cannot recommend this one at all. It isn't fun to read and just isn't the kind of story most of us are looking for after Charlie won his factory."
2,Too much fluff,"This book contains too much fluff. The title is somewhat misleading in my opinion. It has almost 300 pages but only about 150-170 of those pages actually deal with 802.11. Even of those pages, a considerable amount of space is devoted to covering the other 802.11 working groups leaving me disappointed in the 802.11b coverage. The rest of the book covers other wireless networking technologies (such as hiperlan, homeRF and countless others that most of us will never encounter). It also spends way too many pages on vague, 1-2 paragraph descriptions of how business x has implemented a 802.11 network to enhance productivity. And finally, the last 61 pages (aka appendix A), is a word-for-word reprint of the FCC regulations covering unlicensed emissions. These regulations apply to, but are not specific to, 802.11 and are surely available for free on the internet if you really have to have them. I'm still looking for a good WiFi book."
2,Too simple without insight,"This book severs as an introductory book. If you are an engineer with backgound on ethernet, you can skip this. This book is supposed for non-technical people, like marketing. Go for 802.11 wireless network if you want to know more."
4,A comparatively good read at a page a minute.,"This is an admirable explication of the interactive affects of standards, regulation, technology, service, and economics on the surprisingly convolved evolution of Wi-Fi. The authors effectively preserve these five themes throughout. Thus the reader should be able to recognize concepts of interest, and bypass the minutiae. What IT person, or armchair technocrat hasn't meditated about why a technology such as Wi-Fi survived the onslaught of ingenious alternatives. Consider it the story of Wi-Fi, as it has lived and breathed to date. I dare say that this ""history of Wi-Fi"" would give excellent service in business schools as a study of how successful electronic technologies actually survive many subtle interdisciplinary trials. This is a comparatively good read - advanced thinkers in IT or telecommunications could allocate a minute a page with entirely adequate comprehension."
3,Confused,I loved Ms. Simone's first book Reaching Back. (loved it)I was estatic when I heard her new book Reborn was out.I started to read it with so much excitement and was let down from page one. I tried to go back to her first book to tie the first chapter together but never happened. It lacked everything.Please either rewrite Reborn or write another wonderful story like Reaching Back.A fan alwaysL. Miller
3,Could have been better,"On the recommendation of other listeners, I went out and got ""Baby"". I'm sorry to say, but I was not pleased at all. ""One Second"" still blows them all away. If you already have that one, I suggest ""Stella"" and ""The Race"". Both very powerful and upbeat. You will not be dissappointed."
4,Fantastic,"On a good system, On The Run will blow you away with it's low end, Ocean Club will have you hearing ""Norman, Lou Norman"" for days, and Sweet Thunder is just plain Kickass.if you only get one yello cd, get '1980-85 : The New Mix All In One Go', but if you get two, get it and Baby."
5,Wonderful!,"First off, Debut is my least favorite of Bjork's albums. When I saw this at the store I couldnt help but buying it though (its bjork, it cant be bad!) So I started it up expecting it to be a little better than the live on MTV Unplugged DVD. Well, I was very suprised!! I believe this is my second favorite Bjork concert DVD next to RoH. Bjork is so awesome :)"
5,"Very well done, a definite musthave","This video is excellent. It is filmed very well for a live perfromance. It includes almost everything from Debut plus ""Atlantic"" a beautiful song. There are interviews with Bjork and she is adorable. It's fun to watch over and over. You must have this to add to your Bjork collection!"
4,pretty good show from a very nice first album,"i purchased this dvd recently.its a concert with little bjork interviews in between.the picture is good, the audio is dolby 2.0.... 5.1 or dts would have been better.she used mostly real instruments. like drums, electric bass and such. i would have rather she just had an apple computer up there. the live instruments dont have the same punch as her studio album.debut was a great cd with great catchy songs so i wanted to see a live show of it. this satisfied me.there is also a dvd of her mtv unplugged out there that i recommend. it has many songs from debut and she is dressed pretty cute."
5,Great classic horror,"Saw this movie when it premiered in Cleveland. These guys definitely know how to make a good, classic horror. Just enough gore, not too over the top. This movie has a plot, instead of just a bunch of special effects. Plan on seeing their newest release next weekend."
4,Good quality for the money,"This shoe has a pretty good fit and is pretty comfortable. I also like the cobalt blue color, as it is a hard one to find. It is pretty good quality for the price. Delivery was fast."
3,Caution,"I had to carefully bend the board holder arms outward because they are shaped to hold a board with legs that run at a 90 degree angle to those arms, and mine do not. Since the arms of my holder are no longer shaped as intended, the rubber covering has already worn off one of the arms. Also the screws that come with the holder are too short to work well in dry wall with anchors, so you will need to have longer screws at the ready if you are attaching the holder to dry wall. However, it is now very secure and does the job."
3,good for what you pay I guess,The product is a pretty good value for what you pay however note that the screws included aren't long enough for most installations and don't contain anchors for dry wall. This is easily fixed by a trip to your local hardware store but don't think you are getting everything you need in one box.
4,Sturdy and easy to install,"I bought this so I could clean up my office area where most of my cleaning supplies live. The installation was quick and simple, and it held the iron no problem.My only concerns are with the cable holder (it's not very secure, so we still loop the cable through the iron handle).Also, if you buy this, make sure your ironing board feet are the T design as pictured. We had a Y design and it wouldn't hold, so we had to go to the store to replace the board (had to anyway, the old one was old).Otherwise, great product!"
4,Useful product,Seems strong enough and fit the spot I wanted it in but in order for my new iron to fit in it we had to file off a little of the tabs that hold the iron in place. It seems new irons are wider than old ones. It would be helpful if the holders had a way to be adjustable.
3,Good product but didn't fit my iron,"This seemed to be a nice, well-built product. Unfortunately it didn't fit my iron. It's a Hamilton Beach and I guess it is a larger iron than most. But it didn't seem much larger than the rest of the irons on the shelf when we were picking it out. I'm wondering if irons in general have just grown larger lately. Whatever the case, I had to return it."
3,Good item but can find cheaper,"We ordered this when it was about $10 and had free shipping through Prime. It's fine for its purpose, but you should be able to find similar item cheaper and Target and Walmart."
4,Nice Sophomore Album,"If you liked 'The Sign', you'll like this one as it has all the same things that made 'The Sign' great. I love 'Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry' and 'Strange Ways'. 'Ravine' is haunting. Definitely worth buying if you like Ace of Base at all, even if you're a casual listener."
3,PURE EUROPOP of the MID 1990s !,"If you want to listen to a CD that provides you with the classic example of POP music during the rather bland decade of the 1990s then I suggest to you to listen to THE BRIDGE by ACE OF BASE.At one point, ACE OF BASE was globally the top recording pop act to emerge from Europe. Unfortunately, the promotial and sales team at BMG MUSIC did not properly do their job of promoting this product and radio ignored it.The songs on this CD are upbeat and a perfect example of the EURO POP SOUND in the 1990s (REAL McCOYs etc...).If you enjoy the sound of ABBA then I strongly suggest that you consider listening to this CD."
5,Ace of Base's Transition,"WOW-""The Sign"" was that techno-dance tunes we thought the Swedish quartet was. In this 1995 release, Jonas, Jenny, Linn, and Ulf aimed toward a genre less upbeat than their previous release, while they kept it up in such songs as ""Beautiful Life"" and ""Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry"" which was a song with the same drum arrangements of ""All That She Wants"" which was on their previous album. This release is Ace Of Base's second, so they're making a transition from Techno to Pop and Ballads. The full transition is made in the band's 3rd release, ""Cruel Summer"". This transitional album is Ace Of Base's best."
5,wow!,"Ace of Base has unbelievable talent. I can't say enough about how amazing this album is. Their lyrics are uplifting and spiritual, the music makes you want to get up and dance, and their voices, WOW!!! ""The Bridge"" is definetly my all time favorite album out of all my CDs. I recommend reading the lyrics as you listen to it. When you're done, you'll just sit back and think ""wow."" Ace of Base deserves much more fame than the have. Their songs really have meaning and make you think. If you don't already have this album, get it!"
5,Love and friendship in the first degree.../,"If you want an album that makes you think of love, life friends and hope:this is IT! All I could think about was the love this album showed. Especially ""Ravine"" and ""Angel Eyes"
3,A Disappointing Follow Up,"Perhaps it's a change of style, perhaps they were experimenting with a new genre, but my opinion is that Ace of Base's sophomore album ""The Bridge"" lacks in the peppy beats and catchy lyrics everyone remembers from the hits of ""The Sign."" I was much more impressed with the songs of ""The Sign"" and recommend if you don't have it, turn your attention there.I did enjoy the first three songs on this album, the hit ""Beautiful Life"", ""Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry"", and ""Lucky Love"", but it's all downhill from there. ""The Sign"" contains both the smash hits you'll know and the continued beat through the entire album, one which I still play often. ""The Bridge"", however, remains in my rack with a layer of dust on it.If you're a big Ace of Base fan, you may be able to appreciate the changes that occur in ""The Bridge"", but I, clearly, was disappointed."
2,Shallow and reliant on synthesized music,"Could they repeat any of the choruses more often? Ace of Base lacks creativity past a catchy tune. I've heard the phrase ""it's a beautiful life.."" 800 times...and I stopped the song before the end! The two stars I so generously awarded this CD comes from the two songs ""Lucky Love"" because of the acoustic stylings (very different fromt their ""let the computer do it"" attitude) and ""Angel Eyes"". The rest of the album violates music. They'll never top The Sign. Keep trying! Maybe you'll squeeze a hit out of your next album."
4,Don't let the lack of air play fool you.,"This album didn't get nearly as much attention in the states as the debut album 'The Sign' did, but if you were a fan of that album you'll probably like this one as well. The album is catchy throughout and there are a few great tunes on there as well. Overall I felt is was on par with their first album in most every respect other than the lack of promotion and sales relative to their first record breaking album."
2,i hated this album from the minute that I heard it,"By the time I bought this album, I had already worn out my ""The Sign"" cassette. I expected this album to be just as good or even better than the first one. I was soo wrong! The songs on ""The Bridge"" did not have the consistent dance beat that ""The Sign"" had. :-( The only really good song on this album is ""Its a beautiful life"". My problem with this album is that most of the music sounds repetitive."
1,Incorrect information about this CD.,This cd I received was supposed to be a Japanese Remaster that came out in 2010. I received one from Germany that came out in 1995. The cd is five stars but the information I used to purchase the product was faulty. It is misleading. I expected a Japanese 2010 cd. It will make me hesitant to buy any other special cd's if I am not going to receive the one I think I am buying. How do I know if they even look at the different ones available. They could just send the oldest one they have in their inventory.
2,I loved this album even though I am a not a Ace of Base fan (4 Stars),"I was in college around 1995, gosh it was way back, I never really listened to Ace of Base, I did like the song ""The Sign"", ""Wheel of Fortune"" they were big hits in South Africa. I was always into music so my friend gave me a recorded cassette of this album. mmmmm Ace of Base I thought, I put it on, used it as my cleaning the room cassette. The songs grew onto me, especially the non - hits, it was deeper than I expected, more professional, ""Angel Eyes"", ""Ravine"" beautiful ballads, ""Strange Ways"", ""Never gonna say I'm Sorry"", ""Whispers in Blindness"" all great tracks. I wore the tape out, had to eventually buy the CD. Although I do not have any other Ace of Base CD, I actually loved this CD. It really is a mature sound for Ace of Base even if it is not their best commercial success. I give it 4 Stars."
3,"A bit ballad-heavy, quantity dominated quality...","It seems like this basically has all the songs of a normal AoB album, but diluted by a bunch of much weaker songs that were thrown in just to make the running time longer. It turns out that Joker was on some ballad binge during this time period, and ended up producing such gems as ""Angel Eyes"" and ""Experience Pearls."" Unfortunately, this comes at the price of songs like ""Wave Wet Sand"" and ""Whispers in Blindness"" being included. Also, after hearing songs like ""Ravine,"" I'm convinced that the Berggren sisters should stick to singing and let the boys do all the songwriting.The better half of the songs on this album are ""Beautiful Life,"" ""Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry,"" ""Lucky Love,"" ""Edge of Heaven,"" ""Angel Eyes,"" ""Que Sera,"" and ""Experience Pearls.""Not AoB at their best, but still 200% better than any Britney album."
5,TIGHT!,"Although I like all 3 Ace of Base CD's, this is my favorite. Not that I minded the reggae influenced dance, but The Bridge offers more style and depth. The songs are well crafted synth-pop grooves. I always liked dance bands that also did ballads, and they got some great ones! ""Experience Pearls,"" and ""Angel Eyes"" are very pleasant. On the up beat side, ""Beautiful Life"" and ""Lucky Love"" are sure hits. Also loved ""Wave Wet Sand"" and ""Strange Ways."" Read the liner notes, and see what fun the band had making the CD, and how close they all are. The girls are hot too! Synth-pop fans, if you don't have this, your collection is incomplete."
4,The Bridge criticism,"Sorry. Somebody has to do the job of pointing out the bad things. If you are used to the positive 'high spirit' songs from The Sign then this album is not for you. All the songs except ""Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry"" hardly qualify as pop music. Too depressing, with Ravine being one of the most tedious (sorry) and boring AoB songs."
4,Rainaldi Quartet,"This is a very fine mystery, with knowledgable details about violin making and dealing. The author creates suspense without losing believable details. The characters are well depicted, and the situations suspenseful. Highly recommended."
3,Okay mystery but not for Italy,"As someone married to an Italian and who has lived in Italy, the characters jarred. The way they spoke, the way they moved - it didn't feel genuine. And this bothered me all through the mystery. It's been a little while since I read it, so I cannot give an exact example, but this mystery didn't work for me.As a contrast, Donna Leon writes very convincingly of Italy and Italians, as did Michael Dibdin. Now you know."
3,Rainaldi quartet,This book is full of facts about violins. The names of the violins and characters is a little challenging to keep track of. I don't think I would recommend this book it seemed rather contrived at times.
4,The Rainaldi Quartet,"This is a very nice read. Entertaining mystery and particularly enjoyable for anyone who loves classical music and is interested in violins, history of violins and violin-making. I learned a great deal about violins while enjoying the plot and characters at the same time. Highly recommended this book"
5,A breath of fresh air,"Randy Newman's Faust is a treat to listen to. The cast is unbelievable! The songs are so well written and the performances by everyone are so expressive. It is daring and raw, but the storyline definatly comes across to the listener. You come out of listening to this wanting to see the show, or for me, be in it. I hope it makes it to Broadway. It would shake it up, for the better. I especially loved James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, and Linda Ronstadt's performances. They were wonderful,but of course they would be. This is great material with great artists!"
5,A classic,I could not let the song with Bonnie Raitt pass into extinction-I love this rendition of Feels Like Home to me!!!
4,randy newman is almost always good,"I had no idea Newman had written a musical. A couple of good songs and some mediocre songs. The real jewel is the fact that he had some really well known and good singers. I'm not sure there was ever an original cast or an original cast recording...so he created a concept cast and had them sing the songs. My absolute favorite, and the reason I bought this without having heard it, was Bonnie Raitt singing, ""Feels like Home"". The whole album was worth that one song. I had not known where the song came from...but it is a GREAT song."
3,"15 Songs, or, Everybody Sings Newman","As someone who does not know the ""Faust"" story but likes Randy Newman, I find the FAUST album hard to follow on its own terms but definitely like several songs.In defense of the work, I guess the booklet explains the tale. But why did they have to print it in reverse type (white text on black)? It makes it difficult to read.If you like Randy Newman, he does it again on FAUST with several memorable tunes, including ""Feels Like Home,"" ""You Can't Keep A Good Man Down,"" ""The Man"" and ""Bleeding All Over The Place."" Newman sings a few and guest vocalists handle the rest, Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley standing out.I like FAUST just enough, not so much for the concept but rather for its better songs."
5,Initiation Explained,A very clear and lucid explanation of the many facets of Masonic Initiation from one of Freemasonry's best authors.
5,EXCELLENT!,"Brooks & Dunn never cease to amaze me. I own several of their albums and ""Borderline"" is one of their best. My favorite songs on the album are Why Would I Say Goodbye and My Love Will Follow You. Other good ones include A Man This Lonely, Mama Don't Get Dressed Up For Nothing, I Am That Man, and More Than A Margarita. The only song on the album that I didn't like was White Line Casanova, which I feel should've been left off of the album. However, it's easy to overlook one bad song when there are ten other songs on the CD that are top quality. Purchase this album today! You won't be disappointed. This is Brooks & Dunn at their best!"
2,aptly named album,"Boy, they sure picked an appropriate name for this one--it's ""borderline"" in quality. Too bad! Sounds like they cranked it out in a big hurry. The great songwriting of their past just ain't here. Trite arrangements (same old Nashville studio players everybody else uses). ZZZZZZZ."
3,"3-1/2, actually. Not bad, but not their best.","An album I started out totally prepared to like, though I have to admit, I eventually felt that most of the songs dragged on a bit too much. It kicks off with the album's biggest hit, a swell cover version of B.W. Stevenson's ""My Maria,"" which is great fun, although it follows the original so closely that it's really kinda of cheating. (I don't think most of their fans knew it was a cover tune, though, and I'm sure B.W. was plenty happy cashing the royalty checks...) I also liked the song ""One Heartache At A Time,"" which is a pretty straightforward honkytonk number, but the majority of the songs on here are too prefab and studio-perfect... Still, I like how the formula is being used; B'n'D are unashamedly commercial, and when they get their groove down right, they deserve all the success they can find. This one might not be a keeper, but it's not a dud, either."
2,"As a whole, very poor","I love Brooks and Dunn, but they have certainly had some mis-steps in their some 13 years of recording. This is by far their biggest. After putting out three hard rock/country masterpieces, they had the nerve to release something whose only platform to be considered a record is several mediocre, overplayed singles and the C.D. on which it is recorded. Don't support bad albums; anyone with any sense of what music is will not buy this piece of garbage."
3,Not as Good as Other Rubbermaid Products,"I really like the simplicity of these. They are clear, with the once charcoal strip on the lid. It is much easier to see what is inside when you compare it to other Rubbermaid storage containers. However, these are not made of the same matter as the other Rubbermaid containers and can break. Considering the cost of these compared to others, I would have expected better."
3,I want my Mummy,I was going to say that this reminded me of a Fred Olen Ray film and then noticed in the credits that there were thanks credited to him. So if you like his type of movies this is pretty good but with more female frontal nudity than in his films especially the lovely Christine Nguyen she plays the reporter of a low brow tabloid.]Nothing here to stretch the old grey matter but is an enjoyable b.movie with decent production values with extras to boot.
1,One for the garbage can!,"The first thing I saw with abject disgust were huge, fake looking breast that never looked real and went out of style quickly. I had hoped that there would be something about Mummy's in this DVD but all it was tasteless, trashy PORNO. GOD, what huge, silicone filled breasts. They caused me to feel nausius. I threw the DVD in my trash can after less than five minutes viewing. GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH. In this case, bigger isn't better!"
2,ICP Solar products and accessories,"The extension has a problem and it has to do with the connectors ICP uses. They have an o-ring for water protection but the o-ring wears out and crumbles after verly little time in the outdoors. As for the ICP panel I bought it for, it cracked withing 2 years of installation. ICP did not honor its 5 year warranty, saying it cracked due to getting flexed. It was mounted on a 3/4 inch board so there was no flex. ICP was not helpful. There are other panels on Amazon that I am now using that are half the cost, perform well, have better universal connectors, and above all, last."
4,I don't think it's their strongest CD,"I don't think it's their best, but it's Blackhawk. They don't record often enough anyway. Once you love them, you want all you can get."
3,Big Blackhawk fan disapointed on this album.....,"Although Blackhawk is one of my all time fav bands, this second album from their box isn't ""strong enough"" against it's other albums. The first five tracks, like ""Big Guitar"", ""Like Their Ain't No Yesterday"" and ""Almost A Memory Now"" are great calibre.The best, being the roots-rock heavyweight ""I'm Not Strong Enough To SAy No"" make a great Blackhawk formulated song. An excellent one. The rest, like ""Hook, Line And Sinker"" or others after it are all almost boring cardboard. The lyrics in these last tracks are weak, and (no joke) cliche. Not dreadful, just a half-effort in the last half.Other than that, it is a strong starter that didn't finish with better material.Better try the awesome ""Love And Gravity"", or their self titled debut."
4,Solid case,"Works great so far, my only complaint is no shoulder strap, but I knew that when I bought it."
3,forgotten Chandler 'classic' is not much of a classic..,"'Playback is a rather prosaic effort by Raymond Chandler, which is disappointing to anyone who has enjoyed his other great works starring the enigmatic private eye Philip Marlowe. The prose doesn't crackle like his earlier works, and the 'modernization' of Philipe Marlowe (he actually has sex with his femme fatales) is distressing.Now as for the story, we have Marlowe hired by some mysterious individuals to shadow a gorgeous woman for some unclear reason. Lots of running around San Diego County, some violence, but the overall effect of the story is one of randomness. A painless yet forgettable read.Bottom line: really not worth the bother."
2,Chandler's Last--And His Least,"The setting--a coastal town called Esmerelda--is well-evoked. The observations are clever and occasionally poignant. And the mystery surrounding Miss Betty Mayfield shows real promise. However, this time out the characters are familiar and too genteel, the revelations are unconvincing, and the whole thing feels tired, as if Chandler were simply going through the motions. A flat note on which to end a career."
5,American existentialism,"Last novel of Chandler, and Philip Marlowe. On the surface is a classic detective story.But you may be faced with a couple of deep reflexions; about solitude and the individual. About existence.Surprisingly bitter. I find it close to Sartre's The Nausea. Perhaps also to T.S Eliot, The Wasteland."
3,An Unfortunate Finish,"If not my very favorite author, Raymond Chandler is up in the top five. Which is why I loath to rate this book as I do.The Big Sleep and The Long Goodbye were masterworks in Noir literature. The imagery in The Lady in the Lake and Farwell, My Lovely drew you in.Playback, sadly, is but a shadow of the greats it followed. Shallow images, a not quite transparent plot, and well established characters acting, well, out of character. Marlowe burns a few bridges in this final novel (I've read Poodle Springs, and that wasn't Marlowe), and I think Chandler knew the end was near.Whenever I get the urge to slip back into Marlowe's trenchcoat (and those urges come often), I still read the series all the way through. But this book is like a ride home from Disneyland: It's a necessary part of the journey, but the one you look forward to the least."
2,Big Change in voices,"This was disappointing, with no Ed Bishop as Philip Marlowe.The original BBC collection was a wonderful series, and the latest versionswith Toby Stephens just doesn't seem to have the depth in sound and voices.I do remain an avid fan of the entire Raymond Chandler audio books, and love thecity background noises."
4,These versions are almost better,"I absolutely love Sarah's ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" This CD with it's acoustic versions is almost as good. In some cases, I like the acoustic versions, such as ""Ice"" or ""Hold On""; a song that is much more beautiful than on FTE. In other cases, such as ""Elsewhere"" I would readily stick to the FTE version. But it is nice to hear the songs a little differently, and for the most part, I enjoy this CD, and I'm not sure if I'll ever hear FTE the same again."
5,"""Fumbling Towards Ectasty"" the way it could have been",I much prefer the sparse sound of this music. The simple arrangements showcase the voice and the melodies. This cd has a basic streak that reminds me of listening to musicans playing in a dark smoky club - musicians playing because its a place to play. FTE sounds overproduced to me after listening to this.
4,Alternative versions of FTE songs.,"If you really liked Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, this album may appeal to you as well. In some cases, the remade songs are more interesting than the originals (""Plenty"", ""Ice""), in other places they fall a little short. The alternative versions are very interesting, and a worthwhile addition to any Sarah McLachlan collection."
5,A new twist on an old favorite,"The beautiful, ethereal songs or Sarah Mclachlan are expanded and stretched and molded beautifully into something out of the ordinary on these new versions of some of her best-known works. All the songs are done differently yet the essence remains. This is my favorite of her CDs."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I am a fan of Sarah thanks to my best friend. I believe this is the best album yet! It is so full of real music and not that remastered stuff you hear now a days. If a person with terrific talent, such as Sarah, can just record and be happy with the outcome, then it's gotta be a winner! The understanding of what true music sounds like is the way you feel when listening to this album. Freedom Sessions is real and any woman that can sing and play such beautiful music, must be an angel. Only one thing left to say... Women singers must be strong and Sarah sure shows that through Freedom Sessions!"
2,woozy and too impromptu,"Despite the inspiring album title, I dislike the music intensely. It sounds like a roomful of drunk and woozy people attempting to make some noise. Reminds me somewhat of Janis Joplin at a low point. This group is in dire need of artistry and editing. Definitely not for the music connoisseur."
1,What happened?,"What happened here? WHat in the world was she thinking with this release? It seem to be a pointless one, maybe a need for money? She seems to be in the ""money hungry gotta make a record"" mind frame here. Pointless garbage."
2,Defaulty Product,My package came in a brown paper package. The cologne looked and smelled old and not fresh. The sprayer doesnt work and I havent really been able to use the cologne. It may spray a spot but not a full sream like it should.I would like to have a fresh replacement bottle at no charge to me.
4,Clever and Fun!,"I am really enjoying ""Too Cute,"" which was given to me as a gift. The instructions are clear and the projects seem relatively easy to knit and still creatively challenging. I'm already at work on a sweater for the son of the friend who gave me the book and have learned a few new techniques, plus I like the humorous way the book ""reads."" Knitting is a fun hobby, not rocket science. I especially appreciate that the book includes sweaters and hats for all seasons...this book will keep me going through Christmas."
4,Adorable ~ Would not recommend for Beginners,"This book is wonderful! I have made the booties and hats and want to make the sweater on the front for my daughter (and enter it in the fair this summer before she wears it this fall!). Instructions are very good but if a beginner was to look at these they might toss the book across the room. I have been knitting for 20+ years and found the designs of the clothing a little on the advanced side (color changes, techniques, etc.), but the hats and booties were basic. Ms. Ware likes to use expensive yarn too ($5-$7/hank/skein) but the projects do turn out beautifully with her recommended yarn brand. Great book! Would recommend to any intermediate or above knitter. I will be purchasing more books from this designer in the future!"
4,Not really what I expected,"This movie is actually not really what I expected but it is a good movie.I liked the story it is about Sammy ""the Bull"" Gravano and it is until the moment he became a rat and went into the witness protection program.The story is OK the rest is acceptable. Overall a good enjoyable movie"
5,THE comparitive- religions primer,"This eminently readable introduction to cross-cultural religious studies is one of the gems of my personal library. Eliade does not believe that ""primitive"" means ""simple-minded"" or ""outmoded"", hence, his discussions of ""primitive"" religious ideas are sympathetic and penetrating. The final section of the book skewers ""modern"" humanity's pretensions to having transcended the sacred. The appendix contains a succinct and iluminating chronology of the development of ""history of religions"" studies. If you always thought (along with most of the rest of the world) that ""myth"" simply meant ""old superstition"" or ""false story""' this book has a few surprises in store for you. Just read it!"
4,A classic book for the library.,"Wonderful academic study that left me thirsting for a fundamental revelation. Well written but without the emotive force of ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton. Patton delivers the same basic information in a more attractive and digestible form. This book is great for winning academic debate, but left me feeling hungry for the main course."
1,Don't bother unless you're a philosophy PhD,Omg. I was really looking forward to this book but the title is very misleading. The author went on a huge ego trip of using million dollar words thinking it would impress people. I wasn't. I remember coming out of Grad school doing the same thing. People looked at me like what foriegn language are you speaking? If your target audience is the general public speak in real language. I understood it but it was so boring and reminded me of some teachers I had that did not know how to teach. Take out the million dallar words and you could sum up what he was trying to say in maybe 5 pages. I gave it away to a Philosophy Professor.
5,"Wise, Insightful","Before Huston Smith, Mircea Eliade was probably THE writer on religion. His writings are deep and beautiful, exploring what is profane and what is sacred particularly through the evolution of myth and early religion.""The point to be emphasized is that, from the beginning, religious man sets the model he is to attain on the transhuman plane, the plane revealed by his myths. One becomes truly a man only by conforming to the teaching of the myths, that is, by imitating the gods.""What has stuck with me is how he's described the way that primitive man would seek out and find the sacred. For example, finding and creating sacred space and the threshold between the sacred and profane space.If you like this, also consider Joseph Campbell's writings, as well as John Huston's."
3,Puzzling.,"I am surprised just how much is wrong in this book. I am even more puzzled by the unquestioning support given to it by luminaries such as John Klineberg and Mary Ellen Strote. While a writer on health and fitness topics should not be expected to have a thorough knowledge of space history and know how many errors this book contains, I would have thought that Klineberg, former director of Loral and the Goddard Space Flight Center, would have read it a little closer and spotted the many errors. It's puzzling to see how many glowing reviews this book is receiving despite its deep flaws."
4,"Well intentioned, but...","The author has made a great attempt to write an outstanding book here, and it is very close... but she doesn't seem to have much in-depth knowledge of the subject, and it really shows. She writes very well, and has had unprecedented access to some of the most important figures in space history. But her lack of general knowledge of the space program means that the book is filled with dozens of elemental mistakes which would have been easy to check. In a few places it makes undignified swipes at the personalities of dead people without any evidence to back the claims up. Hopefully a second editon can be brought out that can revise these many, many issues."
3,Good plot but college sophomore writing,"The idea of this book was very good - she should have taken it and run with it. Instead, it comes off like a college kid's composition paper, trying to sound grown-up with an eye towards having the absolute most similes and metaphors per page ever. If you get past the pretentiousness and find this debut author a new editor, she should be very good."
1,Complete garbage,I can't believe this cd is getting the praise that it is. It is by far the worst cd I have purchased in recent memory. There was nothing outstanding about it at all. The lead singer can't hit a note to save his life and the melodies are so disjointed that I couldn't stand to listen to more than 3 tracks. The only thing that warrants 5 stars for this cd is its function as a coaster on my coffee table.
1,Good luck getting these through Amazon!,"I ordered these as a stocking stuffer for my wife last Christmas. As Christmas approached, I checked the status of my shipment, only to be told that I had returned the package - even though I never received it. I complained to Amazon and they told me to try to settle it myself with the vendor. The vendor never answered e-mail. I was refunded the cost of the item, but they kept the shipping charges. Beware of buying Fiesta products from Amazon!!"
2,My husband has a FIT with these.,"These shakers are adorable. Very small and cute... BUT, unless you look closely at them, it's very easy to mix them up. My husband has fits over them and swears he'll find a way to mark them ""S"" and ""P"" if I don't switch them out. Often we'll use the larger range shakers by Fiesta instead of these. Buy the range shakers instead of these if you can find them. I bought mine from Amazon."
5,FIESTA IS SIMPLY THE BEST!,"These salt and pepper shakers will be with me for many, many years. They are just beautiful and match my lemongrass, scarlet and black collection (which incidently look really cool mixed together). After reading many complaints on the web about Fiesta stoppers falling out, I was pleasantly surprised these things were in there so tight I think they could survive a 20 pound weight and stay in! You really have to PRY them out and it's hard to imagine salt or pepper weighing them down. I think some people out there must have just received a bad batch of stoppers because if anything these things require some muscle to take them out. I'm very impressed and pleased. :)"
1,BADDDDDDDDDD,"i still haven't recieved my items, i can't get ahold of the store, it's taken off my visa...NOT HAPPY! please can someone figure this out for me???it is april 13/2012 and i just recieved my items! they are cute, but man are they LATE. AND NO ONE EVER GOT BACK 2 ME!!!"
4,These are cute -difficult to put the stopper in,"Pretty color and nice set. They are small-note the measurements.Once I have the stoppers in -they work fine. Putting in the salt (I just use them for salt) was challenging-at least for me! There is a rubber thing that goes in the opening on the bottom. As I was trying to get it in, I had to be careful that salt was not spilling all over. My teen daughter finally did it for me. She had a bit of trouble-but it was easier for her. Still cute and not expensive-like the color. Just have someone in your household who is patient."
3,S & P shakers,This was a gift for my mother that broke one of her fiesta shakers. Now she has a set of three. She's happy. Thanks Amazon!
1,Cold blood,There was only 1 disk in the case. Suppose to have 2. Just opened this past weekend.I was very disappointed.Aleta Ford
4,The Need for Earthquake Preparedness,"This book does an excellent job of describing the recent history of the New Madrid fault, and the impact of recorded earthquakes in that area.The book also serves as an effective planning guide for government agencies, businesses, and indiviuals. Proper preparation is critical if this now highly developed region is to survive another earthquake or series of earthquakes such as those that occured in 1811-12."
5,A Must for Anyone that Loves Good Music,"This compilation covers most of her material (mainly from her debut to her late 70's- early 80's material.) I love all her songs. She posesses earthy, soulful, diva vocals. Although she is mainly a soul singer, Thelma throws it down every time on uptempo numbers like ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"", which proves she is a highly engaging dance diva. Her music stands the test a time well. Hopefully she will be signed to at least a moderate or small record label and record music just for her fans who appreciate it. Any lover of soul and dance music should have this album. I also suggest fans untilize her message board at VH1.com."
3,Evergreen by Belva Plain,"While the story was very good, I found this book to be full of grammatical errors, improper punctuation, too many prepositional phrases and dangling participals. This made it hard to follow the flow of the story."
5,A very good book,I find myself re-reading her books. I really re-enjoyed this one. I seem to remember seeing this story in a made for tv movie. If I am correct I hope this put it out on dvd.
3,a great book,"I had read this book quite a few years before, and wanted to read it again. I found I had remembered more than I thought about it, so will read it later. But it is a wonderful book, probably the best of hers. A good saga!"
2,Sorry but this is just a boring biography,"This book is a biography of a woman who went to America to try to live well... and she did that, her story is simple, sometimes boring and the main part of the story is pathetic, why? Because when she was married she had and affair that she didn't want, you feel that she was almost rape and with that relationship she had a baby and you will feel sorry for her, but then she went again with the same man and continue her affair until her husband dies, when he dies she decide that she won't have another affair, why she does that? Because all she wanted was to deceive her husband and when he past away the affair doesn't mean nothing because she didn't deceive anybody?"
2,Confusing for Readers,"With all due respect for what the author endured, I have to be honest. The book has too much detail about mundane things, leaving the reader saying ""Get to the point already!"" In addition, Too much information is given in the book, yet little is learned about her memories. Peeling Back the Layers does not pick up speed until three quarters of the way into the book. The author did not even truly heal by the end of the book so reader is left wondering what the point of the story was. It is not very helpful for those who have suffered from repressed memories of abuse and may even confuse them. Sorry, but I have to be truthful."
3,30 years war from worm's eye perspective,"The book read more like a fable than history and if you want to understand the scope of this piece of history, this is not the book to read. It is not a ""page turner"" for sure."
5,A seldom seen view,Colorfully and emotionally provides the usually ignored perspective of the noncombatant to the reality of war.
3,"interesting history, not good writing","I wanted to enjoy this book, because of the Wall St. Journal article. The story is moderately engaging, but the ""plot"" is simply a narriative, and the characters are petrified wood. The prose style is Louis L'Amour or worse. One does get a good feel for the atmosphere of the times; as to whether it is good and accurate cultural history I am not qualified to say. I know this is an earnest effort, and I'm not trying to knock the guy who did the translation (it is probably just as stolid in German), but if you're looking for good German literature, this ain't it."
4,Great Account of a Great Filly,"I am an avid fan of Ruffian. There aren't too many books actually available about this fabulous filly and this is one of the first in a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Toby interviewed many people involved in the filly's life, so the story was a very personal one. I recommend this book to any Ruffian fan."
5,"TRACK LIST (Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., Gangsta RID, The Otha Side:)","1) Intro 2) If I Die, Let Me Roll 3) Karson Mks U Bounce 4) RID Is Coming 5) Chilling On The Westside 6) G's From The Otha Side 7) Operation Green Light 8) One Life, Last Breath 9) Born May 1st 10) Tellin' Who Sent Yo Ass 11) Happy Feeling 12) Occupation Hazardous 13) Once Upon A Mossberg."
3,Outdated,The book is useful and had some info but on the whole it needs a revision as the treatments for cancer have changed since the 80's.
5,Unique item,"These earrings are just the right size, for the second holes in my ears. They would also be a good size for a small child. They are, in my opinion, in a very good buy."
5,The why & wherefor of the Eastern Front in WWI,"This book totally changed how I looked at the eastern front. Anyone how wants to understand the unending drive for a breakthrough on the western front needs to understand the ebb and flow of the eastern front. I always thought that the Austro-Hungarian forces just simple bad, this book tells you why. Has one of the best Bibliographies I've seen in a popular history.P.S. I love the cover."
4,Detailed account of WW1 from the other side,"Not much can be added to the previous review, I can only add that this book is one of the best you'll find in detailing the war from the view point of the Central Powers. It is also one of the very few that gives an account of the role played by Austrian-Hungarian forces. The author provides the reader equal coverage of the fighting on the Russian & Italian Fronts along with the Western Front. Overall a very well researched & detailed account and well worth the time to sit down and read!"
4,Anthrax - 'Collection' (Universal),"Total of sixteen in-your-face moshing cuts by none other than the one and only notorious Anthrax.Many fan favorites are here compiled for your ear-splitting listening pleasure,like ""Madhouse"",""Anti-Social"",""Keep It In The Family""(hadn't heard this tune in awhile now)and ""I'm The Man""('91 remix).Plus two live edits are tagged at the tail end,""Efilnikufesin""(aka N.F.L.)and ""Metal Trashing Mad"".A good price,SPECIALLY on the used copies.Okay,I had two(2)patrons ask me recently about the previously mentioned ""Efilnikufesin"".Look REAL carefully.It's apparently a slighty misspelled ""Nice F***in' Life"" backwards.Don't feel too bad."
3,Buy only if it's rather cheap,"Good point: almost 79 minutes.Bad point: bad compilation - only one song from the classic album 'Among The Living'; no songs sung by Neil Turbin, the first singer."
4,anthrax - the collection,"Now,I listening this collection.It's very archaic from that era,thrash metal with hard core and typical sound from 80's.These 16 tracks are from '85-'94 with Charlie,Spitz,Ian Scott,Bello and Belladonna.Very old,very goooodd.....THIS IS A MADHOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Album Review,"Awesome album, must buy, deliver of item was promt, would recommend this seller to others. This is one of the best soundtrack albums. with artist from Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, to Mary J. Blige"
4,A terrific collection of r&b,"It seems like I am the only one who has never seen this movie. Oh well, I really am not one for watching movies too often. But music is a different story. I heard some of the songs from the film and heard a lot of positive things about the album, so I bought it, and was not disappointed. It has some wonderful songs by some of the best female r&b and soul singers. Although I do think that the TLC song is a bit out of place with its subject matter. Not really the kind of thing you want children to listen to. But, that aside, every other song is wonderful, and most deserve 5 stars. In fact the whole album deserves a 5 star rating, if it wasn't for that one track. Too bad that they felt it necessary to include it."
5,"Possibly one of the best ""song heavy"" soundtracks ever!","There are three types of film soundtracks: the orchestral/incidental music one, the Broadway-inspired one, and the pop/radio-friendly. Falling in the latter category, ""Waiting to Exhale"" ranks up there with the soundtrack to ""Saturday Night Fever"" at the top of the genre.Obviously, every woman that he ever met heavily influenced producer and songwriter Babyface. Each song, including the one NOT composed by the artist (Rodger's and Hart's classic ""My Funny Valentine""), seems to express the highs and lows that experience in any relationship. Babyface, like author Toni Morrison, hit a musical nerve that resulted in a critical and popular success.With a ""who's who"" of contemporary female greats, the album doesn't falter a single note.How can one lose when one has assembled Whitney, Toni, Aretha, Mary J., Chaka, and Patti?"
5,Waiting To Exhale,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
3,good!,this cd look good shape. you can tell it had been used little bit. but overall i was please with the cd.
2,Scratched CD,"Although this is a classic CD, my purchasing experience was diminished by the fact that I received the CD at the very end of the delivery period and upon playing the CD, discovered two of the tracks are scratched. The seller indicated the CD was in good condition when I purchased it."
5,"One of the best soundtracks ever produced, Period","Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds is already well known as one of this generations best producer/songwriter/artists. After sitting down and really listening to the production of this soundtrack it is key to point out that he ""put his stamp"" on this. Every track is directly linked to the motion picture and that is very key. Not just a bunch of artist trying to make a name for themselves. This soundtrack has mostly veterans with the exception of a few, but even the few sound like they have been around for a while. This is a direct reflection of Babyface. This is one hell of a soundtrack. 5+ Stars....."
5,One of my favorite soundtrack albums of all time,"First, there was the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Interesting. Then, some eighteen years later, Waiting to Exhale soundtrack. MARVELOUS. Simply marvelous. Every song on this album is pleasing to the ears. One of my favorites would have to be My Love, Sweet Love, by Patti Labelle. The other one would have to be Count on Me, by Whitney Houston, and Cece Winans. This soundtrack album definitely helps me out, especially when I am having one of those bad days. Or whenever I am in a sensual, yet excited mood. A must have album for all women."
4,great album,"I remember when the hit singles Exhale, Sittin Up In My Room, Not Gon Cry and Count on Me were released I just had to get this album and my girls TLC and SWV were on it too so I bought it. IT was a great album overall and full of slow soft & soothing beautiful ballads. Also other standouts aside from the hit singles are Let It Flow-Toni Braxton, Why Does It Hurt So Bad-Whitney, This Is How It Works-TLC, My Comic Valentine-Chaka Khan. This CD is good to relax to and just chill to cause it's so soothing and soulful and the movie was a huge success too."
2,Hard to judge the size with no reference point,"The ring looks fine online but was so surprisingly small once we received it. A point of reference shot would have helped avoid this problem. I suggest looking at at least .5 cttw, it is not much more and it looks so much better."
1,BORING.,"While your imagination may conjure up scary possibilities with the premise of this 'movie' it's sad to see that the video makers decided to shoot EVERY single step of the long hike these people take into the woods. When the action FINALLY does happen it plays like an episode from some generic TV show with nothing brutal or scary happening at all! Several opportunities for scares are passed up as if the makers weren't even aware there was an opportunity. There is virtually NO blood, no real tension, nothing whatsoever approaching suspense. Seriously folks, this waste of time is just about as boring and as tame as they come."
3,Price,"Sex and the City is a wonderful series, but it's much cheaper to buy the DVDs separately from amazon than in this set."
3,Lost in NYC,"Karen is so excited! Her class is going to New York City to see their Pen pals, have a picnic, and see real dinosaur skeletons! Karen can't wait, until her step-brother, David Michael, gets into a fight with her. The adventures in this book include a huge city tour bus, Stuart Little, and getting lost. I definitely recommend this book."
3,Very close to the vest ...,"Patti Davis writes beautiful, thoughtful prose. I was struck, though, by how little she revealed of her actual experiences with her father's condition. I found myself desperately trying to read between the lines to eke out a bit of substance.One of the few telling habits Davis revealed is that both she and her mother stay in hotels whenever they visit the other's home cities, all the while claiming they have grown to be very close.I also wish there had been an attempt to bridge the gap between 1996 and 2004. It was as if there were some sort of missing-time experience.On the whole, the book reminded me of my mother-in-law's letters written to me from a distant state. They are largely long descriptive details of the daily weather and her excursions to nearby green nurseries. I would like to have learned more."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"While I thought the book was well written, I was disappointed that more about the family's experience with Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's disease wasn't included. The title of the book is somewhat misleading, for that reason, in my opinion. The bulk of the book was more about the author's feelings and experiences than about her father's illness."
4,Great read,"I've read it more than once and enjoy it a lot. No problems w my order, I'd do business again - thanks!"
5,Poignant and beautifully written,"Patti Davis writes of her family's struggle against the flows of Alzheimers Disease as it took over her father, Ronald Reagan. It is not about the disease and what happens to the patient but more what happens to a family that was not together during the good times yet became extremely close during the hardest of times. Ms. Davis writes in beautiful prose throughout the entire book and I found myself copying paragraphs for future reference when I will have to travel that road in letting go of those I love."
2,the long goodbye,The book was somewhat interesting as a family drama set in the background of national history however Ifound it unsatisfying as a family struggling with the loss of a father to Alzheimer's. It was as if Ms Davis gottired of her subject about 5 years prior to President Reagan's death.
1,Practically unreadable,This is a hack-job of a book. Incomplete sentences; incomplete thoughts; repeated text and thoughts seemingly strewn at random through parts of this book. It is really difficult to analyze the book in terms of content because the text is so bad and the book so poorly organized. Don't waste your money.
1,Below average,"Content is OK although a bit dated.Print quality and paper is way below average,The poor quality makes the charts and graphics extremely hard to read.This book will not last long on my shelf."
2,Dated and very high level,"Not a great deal of depth here. This book is a good overview of metadirectories, but had little information about the actual implementation of them. Also it is in need of an update with information about changes in the directory space."
4,Cute and reasonably priced,Arrived really quickly and with a really reasonable shipping cost. We were looking for a small table to put a lamp on in our extra room and this table does the job! I'd been searching at goodwill and garage sales and didn't find a better deal. It was east to put together and it's sturdier than I expected.
4,It's a White Table From China,It's a white table from China. Where's the mystery?It has a drawer that I wouldn't trust and four legs.It has overwrought aged detailing.It looks fine for the 20 bucks you spend.
2,Disappointed,When the table arrived it had 5 black marks on the top of it. These marks will not come off of it. Even though this was an inexpensive table I was hoping for better quality then what I got. I am very disappointed.
3,you get what you pay for,"This table is not packed well, be prepared to do some touchup on the paint, as it will be damaged in shipping.The drawer handle is cheap, and the drawer does not slide very smoothly.Despite all that, I like the table's style. It was easy to assemble, and is relatively stable. If you are looking for an inexpensive table and are willing to deal with a few hassles, this might be a good deal for you."
5,This is a beauty!!!,"This little side table is just a beauty for the price. It's small, yet functional, and is just perfect for my need. I thought that the drawer on the front was just faux decoration and probably none functional . . . but it actually IS a drawer. SO CUTE! Would recommend to anyone looking for a 'shabby chic' style side table. I saw the exact same table on another site for $79, so you can't beat the price on AMAZON."
5,Perfect,I was Very pleased with this table i had no idea what to expect with the price being what it is. Very cute and easy to put together.
3,Decent Product,Decent product - easy to put together and lightweight. A bit on the cheap side but fits the price. Paint is very flat but does have the shabby chic look. Drawer (approximate inside measurement: 9x10 inches) has no stopper so will fall out if not careful. Overall appropriate for the price but would not have purchased had I seen it first.
3,Broken,The table corner was broken and glued back together. I'm upset but its not worth returning it. This could be a cute table for being so cheap.
3,white side table,Although the table is nice and sturdy there were 6 black marks on the table top. I think they were from the leg positioning. I will just paint the top to cover because I do like the size and style. Too much trouble to return. Good pricing.
2,Yea. No. Not exactly as described....,"You can't beat the price, it's true. And it is a cute, little table that fits in a cute, little corner in my home.So why not a higher review?The description states:""Wood with distressed white finish"".Okay. Their idea of ""distressed white finish"" apparently is to carve out large strips on the table top and then color them in with a black pen. I'm not exaggerating. This table would be perfect if they just didn't try to age it. It looks pretty stupid and, initially, I thought my table was actually damaged! I settled on covering the marks but just consider yourself warned. Look at the negative reviews carefully please...many/most of them are for users who believed their table arrived damaged, that is how poorly the ""distressed white finish"" is.Good luck, best wishes to you."
5,Great little table!,"I bought this table for my daughter's shabby chic bedroom makeover, and I was not disappointed! It is really easy to assemble (no tools needed) and it is surprisingly sturdy and well made considering the price and the fact that it was made in China. The designs on the sides and drawer are very cute and not too ornate or gaudy. And the drawer pull is very cute as well! I recommend this if you like the antiqued, shabby chic look and a small little nightstand or side table."
4,Not to bad,"The tables were actually a little nicer looking than I thought they would be. They would look great for a cottage, beach, or french styled room. They were easy to put together but be careful with the legs. One of the metal pilot hole casings came right out of the wood when I was trying to screw one of the legs in. Nothing a little bit of gorilla glue couldn't fix. They are pretty cheep nightstands, so I didn't want to send them back. They seem sturdy enough though and they look nice in my spare bedroom. Glad I got them."
3,"nice table, badly packed for shipping","The table itself is very nice. The instructions were clear (you just have to screw on legs). The drawer glides very smoothly even though it has no glides. The problem was the way it was packaged for shipping. One side of the flat piece that goes close to the bottom was marked with 4 black indentations. No problem - I just turned it good side up. But then I looked at the very top surface - same black marks and you can't turn that upside down! I spray painted over these and it the paint covers the blackness, but they are indentations so they are definitely still very visible. I'm still using it in my new bathroom but I am disappointed with the top."
4,mony well spent,I bought 2 of these for our bedroom and they worked out just right...very sturdy and cute once together...the drawer isn't much of a drawer more for looks then anything else.
4,"nice for price, but needs paint job","For the price this is a pretty end table. Of course it is made of cheap materials, but with a coat of paint it looks just fine now. I never cared for ""distressed paint"" which looks sloppy to me, so I knew ahead of time that I would paint it with ""natural cream"" color paint."
1,Do NOT Buy,This table is junk. It arrived with the front of the drawer falling off and the side decoration falling off. It is very cheaply made and not even worth this cheap of a price!
4,Great shabby chic table for the price!,I ordered two of these tables to use as nightstands in my shabby chic room. I was looking forever for something not overpriced as most shabby chic items are. I am very happy with this purchase! It was very easy to put together (no tools needed). None of the parts were damaged. The tables look great next to a bed. I will say that these tables are more for looks than function. This is a good stand to place small decorative items on. The drawer is a little flimsy so I wouldn't put anything too heavy inside. Also don't expect a very perfect distress finish on this item. You might have to do some additional sanding if you want it to look really aged. I was fine with them as they came though. Overall a great little nightstand! Also watch the prices as they fluctuate quite a bit. I got mine for about $40.
2,Weird chemical smell?,"I ordered 2 of these tables...and I have to leave the window open in my bedroom. I don't know it it is paint, or whatever...but both tables have this very strange toxic smell. I wiped both down with a damp sponge and still there. Probably made in China at some toxic chemical plant. They are OK tables...kinda cheap but good for a summer or vacation home. Did anyone else notice that stench? ugh."
2,every part damaged,"Wow I don't usually take the time to write these things but I feel I must warn others because I read another review that had the same issue. Lest see, the paint on the top was rubbed off in five spots the carving on the side was broken and half of it was missing and the spot where it used to be was cracked. Every leg was scratched to the wood at lest in two places. One leg looks like a 10 year old tried to repair it with wood putty. Buyer beware. I hope the seller can take care of me but not before Christmas Im sure."
2,was broken,"I love the antique of the shabby chic side table I got. But when it got here the drawer front was broken off the drawer, and one of the leg parts where it assembles to the other leg was stripped out. Luckily my husband was able to fix both."
2,Very disappointed!,"We purchased this table for our grandbaby's nursery. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but after seeing how terrible the top looks, I contacted the company to get a replacement. They replied that it is supposed to look like that. It has 5 black lines on the top & shelf, like it was stamped. Since we would have to pay over $18.00 to send it back, we plan to sand the top and paint it. It can't look worse!"
5,Perfect as a Nightstand Too!,"As other reviewers stated, you usually get what you pay for. Not so with this table! It went together in five minutes and is the perfect height next to my (quite tall) bed. It is far sturdier than I expected, and it does not wobble on the carpeting. The legs also have rubber guards on the bottoms, should you plan to have the table on a wood floor. I plan to buy more for the guest room. The only negative is that the sticky letters the manufacturer uses to mark the pieces are difficult to remove. Goo-Gone or rubbing alcohol should do the trick. It would be advisable to remove them before putting it together. I am considering cancelling a much higher-priced table I ordered and replacing it with this one... at 1/4 the price!"
3,Good enough for $40,"The table drawer arrived damaged, but was easily fixable with a few nails. This table looks nicer from afar than close up. You can tell it's just been spray painted fake wood and it's a little dusty with a white film. The ""antique/shabby chic"" look (where the product looks worn) looks like it was created by someone scratching the surface and coloring it in with black marker or pencil, I'm not kidding. But, you pay for what you get. All in all I'm satisfied with the purchase because it was only $40 (incl. shipping). And as long as you're looking at the table from more than 1 or 2 feet away, it looks like a cute table and is a nice height."
5,Just What I Needed,"I needed two small and cheap bedside tables for a temporary apartment I am renting. These tables turned out to be the perfect solution and probably something I will actually use in my next house. I am extremely glad that I read other reviews though about the five black marks on the table top otherwise I would have thought that my item was damaged (as my husband did). I turned the bottom shelf over when putting the tables together so the only black marks you can see are on the top. These tables were EXTREMELY easy to put together (5 minutes each table)! Overall, the tables are sturdy and very cute if you can overlook the black stripes... Perfect product for me!"
2,I really do love this,".. but one of the legs are about to break in half and there is such a horrible smell. There are black marks that can easily be painted and the legs can be glued together so it won't break, but that's so much an effort. I really do love this though, so I'm kind of stuck in the middle."
5,Lovely Table,Where to begin to explain how wonderful this little table is. Fast shipping and easy assembly makes this the perfect table. Sturdy and well worth the money. Would not hesitate to buy another if the need arises.
1,"Junk!!!! Bad finishes, not like picture.","So disappointed! I got this table for a side table in my little girls room. The first one arrived broken and discolored. I know it's suppose to look aged and shabby chic, however it just looked junky! It's easy to put together, but it looks like the bottom legs were manufactured in a different place than the middle legs. Finishes did NOT match. The appliqué on the side is cute, but the finish did not match the rst of the table. It looks yellowish and broken off easily when i was putting the table together.I contacted the company to ask to return the table and get a refund. They refused the refund and sent me another junky table. now I have 2 cheap looking tables....not happy with this purchase."
3,The factory missed an important detail!,"This little stand is entirely adequate for occasional use in a summer home bathroom. One flaw: when you pull out the drawer it hangs down. Maddening! It needs a small piece of wood glued in the drawer receptacle to fix the problem. This simple, common sense fix should be accomplished before such items are sent out! At the factory it would be a cinch to do this right! I have allowed three stars to express fair value for money paid."
1,Poor packaging caused product damage,"I ordered 2 of these tables. They both came poorly packed and there were deepblack stratches on the tops of both tables.I had to coat them with 4 layers of white sprary paint to cover the ugly marks causedin shipping. The scratches are deep into the surface, and can still be noticed evenafter the painting, but you would have to get up close to see them.Other then that, they were very easy to put together, and seem fairly sturdy."
5,Enjoyable show about fascinating topic,"I recently watched this video and was very impressed. I was not familiar with Eugene Shoemaker prior to the video, despite his important role in space exploration. It was a wonderful reminder that behind all of the famous faces of the space program, there are many dedicated scientists who spend years following their passion. I enjoyed learning about how his wife had joined him in his life-long quest.Unlike one previous reviewer, I did not find the video to be disjointed. Perhaps the title and/or cover image are misleading, since there is a great focus placed on the individuals involved (not just on asteroids).I highly recommend this for anyone interested in geology or space, including adults, homeschoolers, students, etc."
4,An unknown asteriod just hit Jupiter,"That a comet or an asteroid might hit the earth and has done so in the past(1908 in Siberia) is an established fact, yet we have no effective watchas yet for them.The kind of CCD camera used to detect the Pluto like Kuiper belt planetoidscould be used to detect their ( large objects near earth) characteristic rapid motion against the background.This movie convinces scientists but the politicians still haven't invested money in a government sky watch which is necessary."
5,Served its purpose,"This item was exactly what I needed for my laundry room. I didn't need a holder for the iron, just the board. It keeps the board hidden from view."
1,missing part,the door ironing board rubber tip was missing on holder. It was not in a package or anything. You would think the person packing this order would have noticed it.
3,"It does the job, but it sure as hell is annoying to close the door too quickly and hear it slam","Its the nature of the holder, but it doesnt make it any less annoying that when you close the door quickly the ironing board slams against the back of the door. Other then that complaint, the holder works well, and does exactly what it was designed to do."
3,Doesn't work for me,"Since this is over the door, it doesn't work for me. I have old, solid wood doors that are much thicker than these can handle. Too bad there is not another way to install on the door, rather than only over the door. So it is basically useless to me."
5,Great solution to a problem,"Having the over-the-door hanger for our ironing board solved a problem we had with space. I flipped the ironing board backwards, so the metal legs wouldn't hit the door every time we opened and closed the door. It works with the ironing board hanging in either direction."
5,A no-nonsense guide to the tastiest places in Chicago,"The Streets & San Man's Guide To Chicago Eats is a no-nonsense guide to the tastiest places in Chicago to grab a bite. Each brief restaurant listing offers a rating for food quality, address and phone number, directions, and a sumptuous summary of the quality of food to be found therein. A selection of coupons good until December 2006 rounds out this useful and handy reference for travelers and Chicago natives alike."
5,Cheap Chicago Food Places,"Fun, interesting guide to Chicago eats from those who like the hidden places to dine."
2,"Started out good, but went downhill fast!!!","This book took a sharp turn that I just don't understand. It began as a romance (hence the 2 stars)and then swerved off course big-time! If your idea of a romance includes a hero who is a bigamist and a heroine who attempts to self-abort her baby (a task which her mother happily completes)and then sleeps with another man (and lies about it to her husband), then this book is for you.But if not, then avoid it like the plague...I wish I had."
1,It's Not Even a Good Romance!,"Although most of her books I found were satisfactory, this book and another book of hers left me disappointed. The heroine in this book does not have much character for wanting and the hero was thinking of his selfish need. Even in the ending was not good because it was incomplete. There was a lot that needed to be covered."
1,boring !!!,"i am an ardent fan of ms. henley but ""bold conqest"" is a dissapointment from the begining. the hero & the heroine are both weak, selfish and stubborn, there wasn't much romance in the storyline. in simple words this book is boring..."
2,Too snug to zip,"I knew buying online would be tough not being able to see the material up close. The cotton outside is thin, but comparable to others available. The inside is rather thin vinyl as well. I have a college degree, but there are no directions, just the picture on the front of the bag. You assemble the cardboard pieces in a grid and just getting them in tore a couple of spots in the vinyl. Simple...NOT! The cardboard is taller all the way around than the top of the case and you have to stretch the material more than is desired (and barely possible) to get it to close (see pictures), which didn't seem right. I didn't plan to cut the cardboard. My husband looked at it for a few minutes and after some fooling around with the material he got it to close. I unzipped it, got my glasses inside and when closing it, the zipper teeth bent and the zipper got off track. No way to fix it so I am returning what I thought would be a great Christmas present. More material is needed."
4,Stemware Storage,"I bought 3 of the stemware storage for my christmas glasses. One of the zippers broke and the company did replace it. The zippers aren't a real heavy zipper but the storage containers worked very well for me. The cardboard dividers inside seem to be a little high than the container should have and you have to pull the material so the zipper can go around. It does work, I just didn't put all the sorters around the inside."
4,Great for my needs,"Not super durable on their own, but I am putting china in long term storage so will be putting these containers in plastic bins. The zippers are durable and all pieces are great for the price."
2,Bad buy,"I wanted this color so I could identify my Christmas china, but am very disappointed. It is flimsy, not really suited to do a good job of protecting china, but mainly the cup storage is not adequate for the most standard of cups. I also ordered the blue Hagerty storage system and am delighted with it, so have ordered 2 more.DrJimMwww.chezdesamis.com"
3,The Hundredth Monkey (Paperback) by Ken Keyes,"This paperback is written in large print and the reading can be completed quickly however, the paperback was needed to accompany a manuscript vs ( not offered on Amazon) in order to complete the course successfully."
5,Peace of mind when traveling,"Anyone who travels Europe knows that the standard voltage converter/adapter units do not accurately step down voltage. For a hairdryer or curling iron, this is fine. However, my electric toothbrush and even my AA battery charger fried. When my daughter was to spend the summer in Spain, I bought this for a VERY reasonable price for the peace of mind. It's not worth risking frying an expensive IPod. She used it all summer without any issues. I will pass it on to my duaghter-in-law for Japan."
2,Lasted a day,Got it for my kids for Christmas. Litterally lasted a day. Should have just gotted a stearing wheel for my Xbox. The graphics on this are old school.
3,plug n play,"Although not educational, my 4 year old son likes the games. It is easy for him to navigate and has kept his interest."
2,Not reliable,"I have bought 2 of these toys now. The first I bought and my son loved it to death. It inexplicably broke a few months later. There was no sound and the screen was a garbled mess. I finally went out and bought a new one for him. He got very excited until I assembled it and plugged it in and just got the lack of sound and garbled screen. It's a great toy when it works, but it breaks too easily for me to recommend."
2,I must have got the one bad one,"Bought this as a gift for my nephew. My B-i-L tried setting it up, but said it didn't work. I assumed he had it hooked up wrong, but there isn't anything to mess up! I tried it at my place and saw what he meant. The start up screen came up, but nothing happened. I am an engineer with a mechanical and electrical background and a penchant for electronic gadgets. He is an armed forces comm officer and has a masters in IT. I don't think this was operator error."
3,ok,"it's ok, all controls are on steering wheel, drive car with arrow buttons on steering wheel, not by turning the wheel like it appeared, 3 yr old grandson still seems to enjoy"
2,I don't see the point of wearing it..,"This product probably cost less than 50 cents to make.. It's so overpriced for its material and functionality. I don't see the point of wearing it. No nipple coverage, no shaping. For comfort? Nah, I'd rather not wear a bra at all!"
3,inaccurate,"I bought this DVD expecting a chocolate donut with pink sprinkles. I didn't get that. That alone lowers the score two points. When I buy a DVD with the word donut in the title, I expect a donut."
5,Delightful tidbits from the Master,"Chekhov wrote all of these stories under a pseudonym, some of them while he was still in medical school. Until his death, he denied being their author; perhaps he did not want to spoil his image with these bits of humor, or perhaps he did not want to spoil these stories' frivolity by attaching a name like Chekhov to them. Unlike the dark, brooding impression of Chekhov one may get from some of his plays, these stories are lively, lighthearted and often hilarious. All are short -- some as short as just a page or two -- but all will have clever endings, even for readers not familiar with Chekhov or with his specific Russian brand of humor. Many of the stories are not meant to be laugh-out-loud funny, but are comic in the more classical sense, bringing forth clever observations and juxtapositions in a seemingly familiar world. These are highly recommended either as a supplement to Chekhov's better known works, or as an easy introduction to his writings."
5,For a Student of Chekhov,"""The Comic Stories of Chekhov"" were needed to fill a gap in my Chekhov collection. The stories themselves, although possibly not essential Chekhov reading, are worth a good look."
3,Just okay,"Pros: This trailer has a sturdy frame and wheels and rides really smooth. Folds down easily for transport. Cons: The seat is like a hammock under baby's bum- not very comfortable (we placed a blanket on the seat for some extra padding). The front plastic window folds up so that rider can get some air flow, nice feature, but the mesh screen allows tons of dirt and debris to collect all over the rider (my baby was covered in dirt and debris- what a mess). We purchased some tulle fabric and pinned it to the front mesh screen to catch some of the debris- that seemed to help some. Also, the side plastic windows do not fold up for air flow."
4,Trailer usage,"This trailer rocks, the only drawback I have is because I suffer from arthritis, the locking pin for attaching it to a bike frame is very hard to negotiate as well as the pin for the swing arm. the flag to insert on the frame should not come rolled up as it is, it would be better to have this flat and attachable. The rolled up flag rarely opens, I had to roll it up the opposite direction and rubberband it together for a day just to look moderately like a flag.Other than these three inconveniences the trailer is awesome."
4,great trailer,"I have a running stroller made by Instep and love it, and was glad to find a bike trailer made by them as well. It is light weight, even for my behind a desk 50 hours a week husband who doesn't get as much exercise as he needs. I love that it can double as a double running stroller with the removable front wheel. It is very sturdy and the wheels are bigger and safer. We have rented the more expensive Burley trailers and found this one to be very comparable in quality and much less in price."
2,Cheap quality and small,"I did a lot of research in an attempt to buy a bike trailer under $250. At first I brought home the Avenir Discovery but my wife said it needed to be convertable to a stroller...so I returned it and ordered the InStep Rocket. For about the same price as the Avenir, the quality of the InStep's side windows and seating were not nearly as good. The seat was terrible and small - the kids slid into one another. I do not recomend this carrier."
4,Good Jogger'Trailer combo for the price,"I have had this for a year or so and have used it many times as both a jogger and trailer on our bikes. My daughter is 4 and still loves it. It fits her with plenty of room for another child still. My only complaint is I have recently had issues with the front swivel, once I stop and re adjust it works fine again."
4,"Love it, with some niggles","It is really light, easy to pull, attached easily to my bike, and my 2-year-old son LOVES to ride in it. I like the little cup-holder inside and all the pockets inside, he stores a couple of little toys in there.Niggles.... the harness straps are cheap-and-nasty, and can be a pain to unclip. The wheels are a bit fiddly to adjust so they lock tightly. One came unscrewed on a ride, while it didn't fall off, it was a bit unnerving. And it's also a bit fiddly to hook up to the bike too."
5,Wonderful!,"Wonderful. Our 10 month old loves riding and just sitting in this! We haven't used it as a stroller yet but will be soon on vacation. Rides smooth, lots of storage and once you have the straps setup for 1 child it is easy to use the seatbelt system ... for 2 kids it would be no issue at all from the start. We wanted her to sit in the middle and use the combined straps. Highly reccomend!"
3,Not bad for the money,"Bought this product to use at my parents' house out of state (way less expensive than buying a second Chariot). It doesn't protect our son from the sun like the Chariot, and the harness straps are more difficult to use, but he seems pretty happy in it all the same. For the price, it is completely functional for as often as it will be used. Also, the right wheel arrived completely bent out of shape. I am calling the company right now to see if they will replace it."
4,Great read,This is the book that got me into Military history novels 2 decades ago. The action is greatIan Mouer
5,great knife,"This is my second Shun Classic Left-Handed knife (the first was wide santoku). This knife simply rocks. It is very very sharp and fits perfectly in my hand.Really, stop buying over and over $11.99 knifes from retail stores.p.s. Shun company offers free sharpening (just pay one way shipping)."
5,solid country,"If you have only 10 Country CDs, this should be one of them. Alan Jackson is one of the best around today, and this CD is a collection of many of his most engaging songs. They're also great for dancing!"
5,The Clearest Voice in Country Music.,"Hey here's a guy singing and you can pick out every word he sings. The long version of A Lot About Livin' is a bonus. Excellent singing, material and sound quality on this album. Not a dud on it. Can Vol. 2 be far behind?"
5,every one a winner,"There isn't a lame song in this whole collection. Not only is Jackson a superstar for his talent as a performer, but his copious gift as a songwriter will ensure his fame long after he's gone from this earthly realm.He penned 15 of the 20 songs on this CD, among them many of my favorites like ""She's Got the Rhythm"" and most of all, ""Midnight in Montgomery""...the entire CD is worth buying for this song alone...a moving tribute to Hank Williams, with a haunting, beautiful melody.The musicianship thoughout is top-notch. Just listen to ""I Don't Even Know Your Name""...it's spectacular, and those guitars on ""Mercury Blues"" !...just amazing. The booklet is great, with lyrics and commentary by Jackson about each song (though you'll need a magnifying glass to read it, it's worth it), and lots of photos, including a back page ""centerfold"" of Mr. Long 'n' Lean himself that's really, I mean really good."
5,Alan Jackson's Greatest Hits,"I you are a coinsurer of Country music, Alan Jackson's Greatest Hits is a must have CD, he is truly one of the greatest artist of all times."
5,A.J. is a Super Songwriter - Duh!,"Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler. A must-have.By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's ""songwriting skills need work""?!!"
5,Some of Alan's Best on one CD,"I'm a big fan of Alan Jackson, and some of his biggest hits are all together on this one CD. If he included any more of his hit songs, we'd need 2 CD's. Every song is good. Pure Jackson! This CD is a welcome addition to his growing collection of hit albums. You won't make a mistake getting this one. It makes a great gift for any Alan fan. I also recommend his latest album, Drive. Another completely good CD."
5,What more could you ask for?,"Here it is. Alan Jackson at his best. He has a style all his own. For anyone who is looking for a good, first, Country Album. This is the one."
5,My Favrote,i got this CD when i was 5 and i still have it i have gone to all of His concerts (in miami) and i absoloutely love Living On Love. i have listend to this cd for a long time it has to be one of his best ever!!!
3,Don't expect this to trouble-shoot problems,"I turn to a book, especially one that should cover more than the basics and help when troubleshooting, but this one comes up short.The first time I tried to use a Mac it was Word 3.02 and I bought a book (Cobb Group) that covered the Mac OS, hardware, extensions, everything. Mac Internet Starter kit helped when I needed to go online and do email and use Mozaic and Anarchy, Gofer, etc.This is ""Office 101"" to walk you through doing simple tasks. Not trouble-shooting Office, exchanging with Windows users, or error codes, crashes, upgrades, patches, or links to places on the web.If someone is slightly familiar with earlier versions, there are best off with a short ""What's New, Quickstart Guide."" If your Entourage won't sync with a PDA, or your message database needs a complex rebuild, the things I look for in a tomb of this size, well, it seemed to come up short."
2,Poorly Written,"The book is poorly written with several grammar mistakes throughout the text. It also poorly cites things throughout the book for instance on page 4 it states ""In March 2007, the Washington Post reported ([...]) that Sears was being run as a hedge fund...."" Why not cite the Washington Post article itself? Did the book really just cite wikipedia? Seriously this is supposed to be material for masters level students not for high school students."
2,Oh... don't know,This was another don't like it book. I think it was too light of a book and wouldn't recommend it.
4,Used for class,"This was the recommended text for a class. We didn't end up really using it much for the course, but it helped me find some general information for our final exam."
1,boring and outdated,"This is the most boring book from the most boring class I have ever taken. Unless you are a manager in an 1800's era shoe factory, much of this material is mundane and outdated. But if you are in an MBA program, you probably have to take it regardless, so too bad for you."
4,Needed for a class in a hurry,"I can't review the actual product, but I will state a fact about Amazon's service. I found out I needed this book on a Thursday for a class that was beginning the next day. I ordered the book after 2 in the afternoon, next day air, and it had been delivered before noon the next day. Amazon had the cheapest price and the delivery wasn't that expensive. Amazon really saved the day and I'll definitely come back."
4,Color means everything,"Although white would have been more appropriate for my boat, at the time gray was going for $19, and what do I care, I'm fishin! *NOTE* If color is that important to you, and you can wait, keep checking back, because the discounted color keeps changing. Not sure why, probably something to do with supply & demand. Other than that, the quality of the construction is fine, base of seat is plastic/composite (?), better than my old seat (plywood) the bolster at the back of the seat could be stiffer, or more firm, and its way too early to know how the vinyl will hold up over time. All in all, if you can wait for your color to go on sale, it's one heck of bargain."
5,An encouragment,I have gone back to previous moves of God to gain insight into the difficulties we are facing today. This book reminded me that God still heals and was an encouragement.
4,Yummy muffins.,"Tasty muffins, quick and easy to make.The directions recommend using muffin cups, I had better luck in a Pam ed muffin tray."
3,"Not a bad ""Best of"" album.","This album is a bit short time wise at only 38 minutes, but it does cover material from the early 70's to the early 80's, so it gives you a broad perspective of the bands albums, plus it has 10 very good songs on it, its worth picking up at this great low price."
1,You get what you pay for...,"This lamp is not worth the money. I recently received mine, and while the design is alright, the quality and safety of it are questionable. The bottom of the lamp is poorly made, so that the plastic is uneven and it rocks. It is also smooth, so it moves very easily. The shade is made of metal, and it is extremely hot when in use. It also gives off a strange smell when it's on, enough of one that I'm probably going to return this lamp and buy a different one. All this happened while using a standard sixty watt bulb. Do not buy this product."
3,Eh...,"I found this to be a little cheap.It was off balance and kept falling over. At one point the bulb broke in a fall and we ended up tossing it.It was in a kids room and perhaps if we had more in the base, it wouldn't fall over so much, but we never had more than a few pencils in the base."
4,Pretty Good,"Well, it does what it supposed to do, I used it on marble staircase and I love the fact that it is clear and you really could never notice it, however now that I have it, I do wish I had bought the 2"" tape is this doesn't seem to cover enough area to really help keep you from slipping. But overall does the job"
3,Can't understand these sets,"I can't understand why anyone would purchase a set like this. If you buy all the included DVD's individually, not only will you still get free shipping, but it's actually [$$] cheaper. I think these movies are some of the best ever committed to celluloid, I encourage every motion picture fan to own these films, but I just think it's silly to purchase them in this way."
2,I don't have money to burn...,"Personally I didn't need all the movies in here, but I bought it anyway... Listen to me... buy just the movies you want, seperatly."
3,Parallel French?,"A good read for fans of parallel worlds; undoubtedly a great deal of research went into producing the book. But if you're going to insist on having Frenchmen speak in French, presumably to add 'color', why oh why not take the trouble to get it properly proofread? A Frenchman called Marcelle? (sic) Oh please! He seems much too hairy to be so gender-challenged. And 'vive la vin'? Sure, French genders are tricky, so get some help! Unfortunately these are not isolated examples, there are numerous schoolboy howlers. Or perhaps it was Alexander the Great's fault that the Académie Franaise never got their parallel grammar under control?"
3,The hero's only flaw is to love..,"This book was slow in most parts, with better flow towards the the last quarter of the book. It is an intriguing premise,and allows the reader to experience an unspoiled North America with a twist. Unfortunately, the protagonist was way too perfect a human. Running back in High School, hardworking farm boy, Ranger/special ops, perfect shape, knowledge of food, drink and art, swing dancer and latent Nordic beserking prowess (and on and on). I couldn't suspend my disbelief after halfway through the novel since the only thing he was deficient in was falling in love with the ""wrong, but all so right"" woman. I'd give this book a pass if possible and find something that reads a little more smoother."
5,S. M. Stirling's Best Novel To Date,"""Conquistador"" is S. M. Stirling's finest work of fiction. It's a delicious romp through the alternate history and alternate dimension subgenres of science fiction. Stirling offers an engrossing, spellbinding look at what if Hellenic civilization survived to dominate most of the known world, and that America would not be discovered until 1946 due to travelers from an alternate dimension, namely, ours. To his credit he has two splendid protagonists in California Fish and Game warden Tom Christianson and Adrienne Rolfe, the mysterious heir of a fortune discovered by her grandfather in 1946. But Stirling's other main characters are credible, three-dimensional characters. Unlike some other reviewers I am not going to spoil the plot, but will say that this is one of the best works of its kind that I've come across. Fans of Stirling's earlier work, and those who are admirers of alternative history will find this a superbly crafted tale."
3,An Average Effort,"Having read much of what S.M. Stirling has written, I felt a little let down by this book. The premise of the story is great, John Rolfe VI, a discharged WW2 vet finds a way to cross into an unspoiled parallel California and rule it as his own. Unfortunately, there are former friends seeking to wrest control from him, as after all there are always serpents in any Paradise. There are great moments in the book. I enjoyed the portrayal of different clans descended from Rolfe's unit, and vintage Mosquitoes as an Air Force. The tipping point of Alexander continuing to rule instead of dying in India provides a good point of divergence from our timeline. However, I was left wanting more than the stock ending with an obvious twist in the book. My feeling is that Conqiustador reads more like adventure and mystery in feudal California than the full blown novel of ""what if"" I had hoped for."
2,Very disappointing entry by an author I generally like,"I've enjoyed Stirling's other books quite a bit. This one spends way too much time exploring the ecological and political aspects of the alternate universe and way too little time on characterization and plot. The characters are shallow and way too ""perfect"". Everyone's good looking, smart, and athletic with a good sense of humor. I'm really having to force my way through to the end. I hope Stirling doesn't go the way of Turtledove, but after this I'm not optimistic."
2,Disappointing,"I made it one-third of the way before throwing in the towel. The characters are too shallow. The plot drags. Another reviewer noted that the descriptive passages seem ""dropped in."" I can agree. It makes me wonder if this is a punched-up novella."
2,just a comment,"This is my first Stirling book and I'm not through with it yet. I've read a lot of sci-fi and I guess this is fairly good but his references to popular culture are kind of annoying. Al Stewart for heaven's sake? This is supposed to be set in 2009! But the funniest one is his continued reference to ""safari wear"" from Banana Republic. Someone needs to tell Mr. Stirling that Banana Republic dropped the safari format many years ago! As far as ""alternate history"" goes I'm not sure this even classifies in that category since it really involves an alternate world, not what might have been in this one."
1,"Good concept, clunky writing","I find that, as I have grown older, my tolerance for clunky writing has diminished quite a lot. I love science fiction, but the genre is unfortunately rife with authors who have not really honed their craft. Stirling is such a writer, and no matter how interesting his ideas are, his sub-par writing gets in the way. Having given myself permission to give up on any book that isn't working for me, I found myself putting down Conquistador less than a quarter of the way in, a book I might have finished--but not necessarily enjoyed--10 years ago."
2,Typical Eurocentric Garbage,"Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this book and its premise. After the first chapter those hopes were dashed. The book is based around a society of people mostly of European descent that at most levels have a confrontational and aggressive policy towards Native Americans on the other side. Just like it occured over here in real history. Napalming a rogue band of ""indians""? The book bases its storyline around a eurocentric point of view that, due to superior firepower, the indians are on the loosing end again. Lame. This book could've been so much more. Its just a case of alternate history repeating history. Lame. To much Flash-Bang and repetitive themes and not enough substance. How about a storyline where indians and ""settlers"" get along? If your going to rewrite a ""history"" try being original. I got about half way through this dump of a book and couldn't take it anymore. Not worth the effort to get to the punchline."
3,Not what I expected,It was less than I expected. The book is fast paced. Interesting theme. The author didn't develop completely a wonderfull idea.
3,Formulaic,"Another reveiwer called it ""well-researched, well-paced, well-told adventure tale"" and I guess that's my problem. A bit too glib, stereotypical charcters doing stereotypical things. I haven't finished this but I want more edge, more surprises, not so much paint by numbers"
1,"Um, we subjugated the aborigines again!?","Having only read one of Stirlings books (Now Dies The Fire) this was stunningly disappointing. Premise very cool. Actual outcome? Sucky!! Have we learning nothing from our own history? Here was a chance to not kill the natives off with disease, I knew as soon as one of the characters coughed that the Chumash were doomed and not to be heard from again until the appendix!! What a waste of a fascinating premise. I nearly threw the book across the room, insteal it was merely dropped into the ""do not keep"" box."
4,Good debut...,"This album was a great debut for Deborah...This album is very pop compared to her last album(witch was more R&B, not to mention a little better too). But this album does contain a few gems including ""Who Do You Love"" witch is the song that turned me into a Deborah fan, also ""Sentimental"" and her version of ""Just Be Good To Me""."
5,Hott Damn,"This is a classic R&B album. Ms. Cox gets my vote for queen of R&B, vocally shes right there with Whitney. I have all of her albums and this one is still my favorite effort from Ms. Cox. My favorite cuts are It could have been you,My Radio,Call Me, Just be good to me, and Sentimental. This is probably not a cd Id recommend for kids or teenagers, It has a very formal mature R&B sound. If you can appriciate vocals than you should definately pick this album up because theres nothing out there right now that comes close. She executes her songs with class and elegence, and yes ladies and gentelmen she takes it there.Bravo Deborah"
4,Very good,"This album is a very good debut....even better than her follow-up I think. But I wouldn't compare her to Whiney Houston like some reviewers have. She doesn't have the same range as Whitney. I think she has more of a Toni Braxton style, although not as deep a voice as Toni. But if you are a fan of Toni's you will be sure to like Deborah as well. This is a very good r&b album, with some great ballads as well as dance tracks. Check it out!"
1,typical R-N-B of today,she sounds like a 2nd tier Toni Braxton all loud&all over the place.the music is weak and sounds just like everything else.
4,A stunning work from a new vocal tour de force,"Deborah Cox proves she has talent in her debut self titled album. She sings with a voice that reminds us of Whitney Houston and Taylor Dayne, which is not surprising since they were both Arista acts. But in all fairness, despite her wonderful voice, some of the songs could have been better. After listening to the pure magic she makes on I'm Your Natural Woman, Never Gonna Break My Heart Again, My First Night With You, and Where Do We Go From Here, one has to wonder why she would take a step down and sing funky hip hop on Call Me and My Radio. But then there is the dance version of Who Do You Love, which showcases her vocal power and really makes the toes tap. All in all, despite a few falters, the album is well worth buying. She is definately a break through Diva that deserves time to find her niche, because for sheer power, she is all that."
2,Bland and weak,"Unfortunately, this album falls under the category of ""A few great singles and 80% crappy filler"" Other then ""Sentimental"" and ""Who Do U Love?"" this is an extremely mediore album which fails to distinguish itself from the crowd. Perhaps Cox's second album will be better."
4,"Love it, 14 months later","This is great Crib. Our daughter has been sleeping in it since 2 months and is now 14 months. The different placements for the mattress is great for when the baby gets older and starts standing up. You just move the mattress down to the second or third position.Sometimes if you are short it is hard to get the child out, but I love it regardless.The only problem that we have is that Pine is a soft wood and the rails are too wide to put a plastic cover, so when your child goes through a chewing stage you will probably have teeth marks on the crib... but we figure it will be a great story to tell her when she is older. I can't wait to convert it when she is ready to get out of the crib.Also, if you get the other furniture (dresser and changing table) they are great together. I am going to buy the same set again for next baby due in June."
5,Love it,"This is a beautiful crib. The picture really doesn't do it justice. We have yet to use it, but it has been set up for a while. We looked at the prices of many different types of cribs, and we were willing to spend the extra money for a convertable, but we just like the elegant look of this one the most. And, with the money we are saving, we will be able to buy a toddler crib that our son will actually want."
3,Half of the equation,"As a life long pilot and college professor of aviation, I have long been aggrevated by the one sided nature of aerodynamic discussions. While not perfect, it does go into great detail about ""Newtonian"" lift. However, the authors' dismissal of Bernoulli is somewhat inappropriate and premature. Bernoulli's work can be derived from Newton's. In fact, Bernoulli used Newton's works in order to discover his equation that is commonly cited to describe lift. In short, you can't dismiss Newton when trying to understand Bernoulli and vice-versa."
5,Gets the Job Done,"The authors want to give you ""the SIMPLEST way to master an understanding of the science of flight"". They do this without any real math to speak of, but their text, illustrations, and pictures very well convey the physical description of lift and other material that they strive to present to the reader. A good book for the layman, the beginning and/or more experienced pilot, but too basic for the engineer. There are typos that may confuse (as on page 24), but for the most part the authors have delivered on what you're looking for when you purchase the book."
2,University logo wear a bust,Knew it was too good to be true! Quality of the sweatshirt/t-shirt was poor. Very thin material with threads hanging off the sides. Returned it as soon as we opened it. Get what you pay for.
5,A real Tissot winner,"Too bad they stopped making this one. It is extremely flexible and stylish. A dress watch not a sport watch. Very thin case, light on the wrist, the band puddles like mercury when you take it off it is so flexible. Catch is strong and takes a bit of doing to un catch it which is just fine with me. the gold accents in the band and around the bezel are subtle so this in not an over powering watch that screams ""gaudy"" as some watch do. IF you can find this watch and purchase it you will be glad you did even at full price."
3,Sunzet Dazed :(,"I bought this book because I thought I was buying a work done by one of Lamour's contemporaries that would be on the same level as Lamour. It was not on the same level. Not even close. It was more difficult to read, it hurky and jerky, not nearly as smooth as one of Lamour's works. The plot was more complex, even somewhat unexpected. The main character was brought to town because he heard a story that his old friend froze to death in a shack, but this seemed odd to him because his old bud was a great hand. The main character then decides that he will look around and see what this was really about. He eventually has to spend some time hidden in bush and sneaking around town, but in the end he is able to clear his friends name and ID the killer. It is action packed, and exciting, but still a little obtuse in some parts."
2,Breaks easily and is very poorly constructed,"I bought this for the office thinking we would be able to use as a little practice putting hole, instead it's turned into a better frisbee. Poorly constructed and the ""wings"" break very easily."
4,psychpopcandy - this is a great after-midnight album!,"well, I wish I had owned this a few months ago while I was still in college...Let's just say this is a great after midnight listen - I'm not advocating smoking pot...but if you're gonna, this cd would be a great counterpart to that activity - seriously though, lush pop, great melodies - haven't paid much attention to the lyrics - this is like candy - a very enjoyable listen, probably worth 3 and 1/2 stars, but since that's not an option it gets for. as an enjoyer of good packaging and cover art though, I must say the album cover is fairly ridiculous - not worthy of the lovely music inside - but don't let that stop you from buying it!"
4,What a Trip in LA,"I saw these guys at a club in LA in April. They were unbelievable. The music ""hooked"" me the second I heard their first song. The crowd was cool and attentive to what was going on with the band. Then I bought the CD 'cause I could not resist after seeing them live.These guys are great, as is their CD-highly recommended for anyone that loves psychedelic music, 2004 style. I played the CD driving on Mulholland and the two went well together, twists, turns, beautiful...as a visitor on a trip to LA seeing/hearing and now owning the CD must have been in the cosmos. These guys are good, really good...I wouldn't even hesitate - this CD is FAB."
4,W40K Comic Novel,"Here is a collection of Warhammer 40,000 tales that prove the courage and raw determination of the mighty Space Marines and Imperial Guardsmen. They hunt down and destroy all the enemies of mankind. They crush all invading greenskin (orks) hordes and lay waste to all the horrible forces of Chaos.**** I found only a few flaws. Most readers either will not notice the errors or simply not care since they are so minor. Yet I could not help but wonder how an ork would know what ""playing chicken"" even meant. Otherwise, Warhammer 40,000 fans will love the non-stop battles described within these stories ... whether the humans win or lose. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,A Different Side,"If you haven't caught the band live and have only listened to the album it would be like listening to an ""unplugged"" album and thinking that is what the artists were all about. I caught them when they toured with Fleck and at least the stage act I saw and heard there was a lot more emphasis on amps and an electrified version of the ngoni along with a lot more percussive drum work. Bassekou Koyate had a really impressive stage presence in those long flowing robes leaning out into the edge of the crowd like a rock god while Malians in the audience flung cash on the stage in the Malian tradition. One of the most memorable concerts I've ever been to. There's a whole different side to this group that the album fails to capture."
5,"The Greatest Hits Collection, Alan Jackson","This CD has great song selections for a total of 20, quite the bargain. If you are a AJ fan, you should purchase this one for your collection!"
1,Horrible customer support,"don't waste your time. Every time I try to use it, it makes me call them, then I have to wait about a week to get them to send me some authorization code, after they try to sell me a newer version for $$$"
3,Expert on Aliens,"This documentary is from the Area 51 Archives and comes from Zecharia Sitchin, author of the series books called The Earth Chronicles. This subject is pretty much his life's work, so what you get is a pretty dedicated view. The cinematography leaves something to be desired, but some might say that just adds to the authenticity. Pretty good price for a 3-DVD set."
5,Zen and the Art of the Detective Novel,"I read the first of the Flap Tucker series, EASY, and was on Amazon minutes after the last page ordering another in the series, EASY AS ONE, TWO, THREE. I really like this good ol' boy with a feng shui brainpan. These are readable, clever mysteries in the style of Lawrence Block. The only problem is...after number 4, you're Tucker'd out. We need more of this great series."
3,Big Inuyasha Fan....,"I'm a big Inuyasha fan, so of course I wanted to add this to my colletion. I ordered this one used, along with a few others... Shipping took almost 3 weeks, the case was shattered, it's amazing that the disc wasn't damaged along with it. The disc plays well enough, so I guess my shipping complaint isn't really that important. I just expected better, having previously ordered from this same shipper on more than one occasion."
1,AWFUL BOXED SET,"Carly Simon is a singer I do not like at all, and she does exactly three songs that I like, and one of them is not here: ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". Her version of ""Mockingbird"" is so inferior to Toby Keith's it is not even funny. I would recommend only getting one CD of hers to get a few selected songs, and that is it. A complete total waste of money."
3,A Really Nice Experience,"I bought this set for my wife for Christmas. She loves Carly. I have always had mixed feeling about Simon's music. Some of her stuff is so filled with insight and feeling that it makes me want to cry and I am convinced she is truly an artist on songs like ""Raining"" or ""The Stuff That Love is Made Of"". However, when she gets to going with the children's choirs and all that, she grates on me like a sandblaster. I can only listen to so much and then it is time for some serious music. As I said, my wife loves her, so Carly is OK by me, but I have to be in a mood for my feminine side to come out to get into her."
5,A BOXFUL OF EMOTION,"THIS BOX SET MAY WELL BE THE WISEST PURCHASE I'VE MADE ALL YEAR. EACH DISC IS DIFFERENT AND FANTASTIC IN IT'S OWN WAY. I FINALLY HAVE ALL THE GREAT ""CARLY"" TUNES TOGETHER INSTEAD OF SCATTERED ON DISCS, CASSETTES, ETC. AND I EVEN HAVE THE REASONS AND MOTIVATIONS WHY SOME SONGS WERE WRITTEN, WHICH MAKES THEM ALL THE MORE MEANINGFUL TO ME. I LOVE THIS SET!!"
5,quality sound,"I really like the packaging, the sound, the order of songs and, of course, Carly's voice. Happy she got over it and included James Taylor. Good value."
1,"Manara, where are you?","I think Milo Manara is one of the best illustrators. In Italy I found all of Manara's works, and - in my opinion - ""Click 4"" is one of the worst comics of his production.We have no plot. Nothing about the mood of Manara's ""Click 1""...Do you want to know the real great Manara? Buy ""Butterscotch"" or ""Click1"", or ""Indian Summer""..."
3,Not his best work.,The story and art of this book should have been fabulous. And they were if compared to the work of other writers/artists. But Manara is not your average adult comic book creator.The sketches are bland and not too interesting when compared to comics like Manara's Sutra or his various collections of drawings.
5,Anxious,"I can't wait for this to come out! I first caught sight of Inuyasha on Adult Swim, while watching the Full Metal Alchemist, and decided to sneak a peek. I was VERY glad to see another show I was interested in to outweigh the tragic plot of FMA. (Its very sad)lol. Anyway, Inuyasha is very amusing, and cute. It is also VERY long, and at times, can be a little redundant. But in the long run, it is very interesting, and the length adds sooo much to the plot. It really makes it less difficult to pick up in the middle, (Which we do not have any idea where the ""middle"" is yet)lol. For this reason, dont forget to start your collection of FMA, which is not over yet, but it does end, thank goodness. Then you'll have a complete collection to refer to, to remind yourself that Inuyasha Just might end. lol.Anyway, I almost made a mistake buying this set from anywhere else, cause everywhere else it is at least $90, Not the collectors set! Here it is so cheap, I wonder why."
5,love it,Seen on TV and now rewatching all the seasons from beggining to end up to the new seasons. Love it and so happy to own.
5,LOVE this DVD box set!!,"I have been an InuYasha fan since the year 2002 when I was 10 years old, and I LOVE it! This box set is perfectly organized and neat just like the 1st season box set! I am a very satisfied customer!"
5,Inuyasha season 2 box set,i have collected every season box sets of Inuyasha and individual dvd i think i can account for everyone because i love it so much so many wonderful characters that make each episode exciting its a true work of art so terrific in every way thanks Pam :)
4,All the best Dannii tracks on one album,"Dannii has released many singles over the years and this album contains them all in there pop perfection. Allthough this album is filled mainly with the cheesy pop of the early nineties it also has some of the songs from her recent album Girl. These songs are 'mature dance pop' style and have a great feel about them. The early songs are okay, but the pure excellence of dannii's more recent materiel make this album a must have for EVERYONE's CD collection."
1,not in stock,It's too bad that Amazon says things are in stock when they are not. Maybe when they outsource product they should have a little bit better inventory control.
3,"good book, good purchase","I very much enjoyed this book and have in fact just ordered a second copy of it for a friend of mine who has expressed a desire to learn just the most basic and rudimentary elements of housekeeping. I think this book should definitely fill the bill for her.I am being asked to tag this product (and informed that doing so is recommended) and I would be happy to do so -if only I knew what that meant - but I don't, so I can't."
5,Linden's Guide to Linux,"This is the book for anyone wanting to get full use out of Linspire 5.0. It has all the technical stuff you need to make using Linspire, the World's Easiest Desktop. It is a must for anyone that has already read The No Nonsense Guide."
2,Fresh From the Farmers' Market,"I ordered this book, because I spotted it at Whole Foods and wanted to check it out. I should have looked into it more closely, since it is specific to farmers' market crops grown in and around California. This is something I would have liked to have known before purchasing it; I can't buy most of the ingredients at my local farmers' market in Virginia, so it's difficult to use for the most part."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this book back in 1998. It looked beautiful. I tried a couple recipes over the years and was very disappointed every time. In fact this is a book that sticks in my mind because I can't figure out why it doesn't work. It should, just doesn't. Pulled the book out again today 12 years later and read it from cover to cover, marked the recipes I want to try that I haven't yet. Tried one of the zucchini recipes. Sounded nice. First time ever my boyfriend scraped it right off his plate into the trash after one bite. I tried it and was also confused. The zucchini and the compote on top just didn't work together separately sure, but not worthy of a being put in a book. So far this is my overall feeling about this book. The recipes just don't work. I use this book to look at photos and get inspired to use vegetable I haven't tried yet. Only I make my own recipes up rather than use Fletcher's.So no not my favorite."
3,Today's arrival,"I found this in our mailbox late this afternoon. Having just completed EFM, I've wondered how this would be presented; but I know, too, that the Canon teaching this class in September would pick the best book with which to work. I'm looking forward to reading this in the weeks to come in advance of beginning his class. I loved EFM, and can't wait to see what will emerge from within this Intro and through this class offering. The book is clean, has a few water stains and a handful of turned down pages, but it is a sound buy, will be treasured. Thanks."
2,A Poor Textbook,"I read this book for a course in Roman History, and found it more confusing than useful. Crawford assumed too much foreknowledge for the text to serve as a primer, but his analyses might prove more comprehensible to the non-beginner. It would take a fine professor, indeed, to overcome the pitfalls of this text in an introductory class."
2,For post-doctoral specialists in the classics only.,"At 200 short pages I thought this would be a nice introduction to the history of the Roman Republic. An introduction it was not. I am sure it is well-written for its audience, but the author assumes his reader already possesses an extensive knowledge of the republic, which makes me wonder why you would then want to read it. It is too subtle even for the thoroughly educated literati (did I use that word correctly?). Anyway, I bought the book, so by gosh, I read it! More seriously, the title and notes on the back are terribly misleading. Somewhere the notes need to convey that the book is intended only for specialists.A new title is in order: ""Scholarly Reflections on the Roman Republic,"" perhaps?"
1,Liberals in the Academy require chastising.,"A beginner or university student encountering this book would come away merely confirmed in the idea--though probably not converted to it--that the Roman Republic and Empire emerged not from a superior genius for civilization but as a miraculous by-product of the avarice of its leadership. Or is miraculous the right word? Absent throughout is any of the wonder or awe that have inspired interest in this subject since its first historians, and without which any history of the civilization is not only flawed, but false, and, at this late date, dishonest. Military campaigns, whether the most ancient or more modern, are often characterized as exercises in brutality; the governing classes are generally treated as no more than class-war caricatures--an impression as often as not insinuated by rather sneering asides and related effects. Etc. A depressing book."
4,Arthur Pryor Forever,"I play trombone, and I have listened to this album, and I think it's wonderful. The sound is not very good, as it is a VERY VERY VERY old original recording, but it is an absolute must have for any trombonist. What can I say, I love it."
5,a fantastic example,Arthur pryor's trombone playing in this exellent assortment of pieces recorded in the late 1800's gives both beginner and expert players fastastic insight on how to improve their playing. Arthur pryor will undoubtedly go down as one of the world's greatest trombonists of all time....and to actually hear him play is an awesome experience.
2,Not so great,"This product has a slight grittiness to it, and an odd smell and color. I suffered through those things waiting to see benefits... Never did. I wouldn't recommend this, as I saw no positive benefits to using it."
5,Fascinating and Informative Read,"This is an excellent book that also provides answers and suggestions and not just observations on how weak and ineffective security is since 9/11. Everybody knows the issues but analysis is limited and nobody has real solutions although this book provides many. The author's long time at Kroll, an investigative company very well known on Wall Street, lends a lot more credence than some of the books I read by former rogue news reporters. I also wouldn't give any thought to the anonymous reviewer here who can't be named, gives a bad rating, and is probably a competitor or someone who might have been caught!!! Made me want to buy this book even more..."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"I thought this book would say sensible security things, but it doesn't. It might be good business for his company to publish these sorts of things, but that doesn't make it sensible. The book is self-serving nonsense of the worst sort."
1,"Not for Me, Thanks",I spent half an hour with this book at a [local book store]. I thought it was the same half-baked everyone-should-be-scared nonsense that I read everywhere. This book has no new insights or ideas.I think they just wanted to paint all sorts of disaster scenarios so they could say I-told-you-so. Big deal.My advice is save your money
1,Give me a break!,I thougth we were all smarter than this. No one wants to read this kind of fearmongering anymore.
5,For Every American,"I have read many of the books regarding President Bush, 9-11 and the breakdown of our intelligence agencies. Although many of them made their points well, I couldn't recommend them because of their political slants to the right or left.Forwarned is by far the most important book any American can read. There were times that I actually lost my breath because of the real fear implicit in its pages. This book was very painful to read and yet I could not put it down!Regardless of one's political leanings this book proves beyond all doubt that we are at war with a very powerful and organized enemy and we better unite soon.I am neither a R or a D but it's time that we demand that our elected officials stop this political correctness b.s., and DECLARE WAR! Anyone who thinks otherwise is a damn fool."
4,"good book,much better than the movie","good blend of sf and guns.the book is not hard to find,u canpick it up at any 2nd hand book store"
5,One of the best film scores out there,"Yes ""I will remember you"" is a great song...but this album is much more than that one song. The score captures the mischevious (sp?) and soulful aspects of the film. The musicianship is outstanding and Egan seems unafraid to tap into genres that depart from the Irishness of the movie, combining jazz, folk, guitar fingerstyle, and even klezmer (I know I spelled that wrong!). A great listen."
4,all songs get better and better,I love this whole CD but IWill Remember You is definetly my favorite!
3,nice.,"i'm not heavy into ""smooth jazz,"" but most of these songs are chunkier than dentist's office fare. somewhere between european cafe and trendy teenage girl clothing store, but a little too soulful to lie exactly on the line that connects them. lightly funked-up beats, restrained electric keyboards, softly bright horns, some wah, one good vocalist, one annoying vocalist, and at least one nice set of steel drums. but 3 songs bite. 3 out of 11 is sort of a lot, but when you consider that some damn good albums only have about 8 songs on them, i suppose 3 isn't too large a number of screw-ups."
3,Difficult to write,"Let's face it, nobody likes every CD they buy--even after listening to samples. I like jazz, but not this one--too rough, too harsh. I have no quarrel with the dealer. The CD came timely and it's in decent condition."
1,Silly Putty,"It was the original product. Slow to arrive item only cost 2.99 but shipping was 4.49 for the small light weight item. I could have bought it in a store cheeper, shipping was a rip off."
5,Spellbound,"I started out reading ""Trials of Faith"" a chapter at a time. In a couple of days, that was no longer an option. I had to finish it. It is an excellent book to give to someone that you feel you need to witness to, but are hesitant to do so. The Plan of Salvation is very plain in this book. I am looking forward to Crystal's next book"
5,"Great price, fast shipping","After going to every store in my area, looking for size 31x34 jeans and not finding even one pair. I turned to Amazon.com and found just what I needed at a price very affordable.These are great jeans and a perfect fit. They have all the sizes and styles."
2,They stretch way too much,"I bought these jeans for my husband. The stretch out way too much when he wears them. He hates wearing a belt, but if he doesn't, these pants would fall down!! I do not recommend them at all"
5,One of the best sf romances around.,"""Dancer of the Sixth"" blends true science fiction and true romance so perfectly that I've yet to find another book in this genre that matches its quality. The love story is outstanding--vivid, real and true to life, though it's set in a futuristic world. As a devotee of good sf, I admired the author's knowledge about technology and aviation which infused the story with authenticity. It's rare to see an author balance romance and sf with such skill. I recommend this book to those who love a good love story and to those who enjoy a strong, solid sf read."
5,Wish there was a sequel or another novel by this author,"This is such a fantastic book. It was brilliantly written, and the plot and characters were original, captivating, and unforgettable. As you can see, the book was written a while ago, but it left a lasting impression. It is one of the best examples of compelling, exciting, and romantic science fiction."
2,Last Days,"I found the book too rock climbing technical for a non climber like myself. It seemed to lack depth in all areas except the ""on rock"" period of the book. I shall donate it to Goodwill."
4,This book is great,Machine Shop Basics provides an excellent reference for those looking for an introduction to the machine shop. There are some points of information that provides a good history of what led to the modern practices we have now and also current practices that will help any machinist.
4,Machine Shop Basics,"The Machine Shop Basics book provides a lot of information about tools and how they perform their task. From vises to chisels, hacksaws, files, gauges and measurements, drills and materials. It also digs into lathe cutting tools as well. Great book to have around for reference."
3,Metric???,"Machines is not my work, but my hobbyI have so far spend a lot on my workshop, and will spend more in the futureThis book was definitely a great addition, very complete, easy to understand,The author takes you from the basics right up to the more complex matter, not assuming prior knowledgea definite recommendso why 3 stars and not 5 ?well,the book is written in imperial, I live outside the US (the rest of the world), and we use metricI do know how to convert pounds to Kg's , but having to convert the whole time is a drag and can spoil a good read"
5,"Great Audel book, exactly what I needed","This book was a pleasure to find on Amazon. The authors cover all of the essential parts of a machine shop in a way that's really easy to read and understand. The book is an excellent reference.Here's the table of contents from my copy of the book:Chapter 1: Benchwork.Chapter 2: Precision Measurement and Gaging.Chapter 3: Materials.Chapter 4: Abrasives.Chapter 5: Grinding.Chapter 6: Cutting Fluids.Chapter 7: Cutting Tools.Chapter 8: Cutter and Tool Grinders.Chapter 9: Drills.Chapter 10: Reamers.Chapter 11: Taps.Chapter 12: Threading Dies.Chapter 13: Milling-Machine Cutters.Chapter 14: Milling-Machine Arbors, Collets, and Adapters.Chapter 15: Broaches and Broaching.Chapter 16: Electrical Safety in the Machine Shop."
2,Insufficient detail,"The editorial says this book, which assumes you have alredy read Audel Machine Shop Basics, will tell you all you need to know, but it falls far short of the mark.The book attempts to cover all machine operations, but fails to provide sufficient diagrams and detailed descriptions for all the operations. I will have to buy additional books in order to fill the gaps left by this author.I would still buy it if, for example, you already know how to set up a lathe to bore the inside of a hole and just need to know the appropriate cutting speeds and want a reminder of relevant machinist tips and tricks. It is also one of the few books on the subject available as an eBook for immediate download. If however, you can wait a day for the delivery of a paperback, choose something else."
2,too basic,I thought that buying this book would show me something new and help me at work. The book was just to basic and had little CNC related material.
5,Facny little lighter - sleek and cool,"Takes up less space in your pocket than a full size Zippo lighter. Works well, although I do find I'm filing it more often than my old Zippo lighter."
2,Get the full sized one instead,"I liked these little zippos years ago so i bought one again. Disappointment. Get the full size one instead. I have 3 of these small ones purchased from 3 seperate stores and they all suck. Full sized zippos work great in my experiance, carried them for years but for some reason the small ones don't work well."
4,Small and compact,My brother loved his that I got him for Christmas! It is very small and he has it with him all of the time now.
4,"Small sleek lighter, but not the most practical","This lighter looks awesome, works well, and serves it's purpose. But i'm not sure if it's a zippo thing, or just because this one is smaller than the other zippo lighters, but the fuel seems to evaporate or run out really quickly. I need to refill it really often. Almost to the point of it being useless unless I just filled it.It's definitely the sexiest lighter I've seen, but I think if you want something that you can use regularly, I would recommend just getting a cheap butane lighter from a gas station. If you want to use a sleek lighter when going out, fill this guy up and bring it with you.Overall 4 stars, because I did buy it for the looks, but it's not very practical, and uses old technology. It's more for fun and showing off than anything."
5,Exactly what I expected...,"Lighter is perfect, of course I'd expect nothing less from Zippo. On top of that the Free (super saver) Shipping and low price make it that much better..."
4,good but not great,"I like this lighter because it fits in pocket better than my full size Zippo lighters. It does not stay lit in the wind as good as the full size either. One thing about this lighter is you have to make sure that the wick is close to the flint or it will not light on the first try, it my take several tries to light. I fixed that with filling the lighter full of lighter fluid and turning it upside down until the wick was wet with fluid, then bent the wick to where it was pretty much touching the flint wheel. Now this lighter lights every time on the first try. This lighter is black and makes finding it in the dark almost impossible. All that said it is still a good lighter and if I lose it I will be purchasing another one."
3,Okay but doesn't hold enough fluid.,This is just like the full sized lighters and works just as well. But it only holds about half the fluid of the original. It doesn't hold enough fluid.
1,utter garbage,"I have four of these batteries, have charged each no more than 10 times. Two hold a charge for mere minutes. The best holds a serviceable charge for about 15. B&D should be ashamed and should come up with a decent battery or abandon the cordless market."
3,"B&D ""FireStorm"" battery","The reason for the 3 stars is that I paid extra for this battery because I ""assumed"" it must be better then the one without the ""FireStorm"" logo that Amazon offers for $10.00 less. I already have two of the ""non FireStorm"" batteries. I couldn't find any information on capacity on Amazon's site but I figured for the higher price it must have a higher capacity so I selected it. Delivery was excellent and I quickly put the battery to use. Bottom line is I do not see an iota of difference between this new battery labeled ""FireStorm"" and the ones I already have without that label except for the extra price. My recommendation is save your money and get the lower cost battery."
2,Rechargable Batteries,"I have found like many others that the Black and Decker batteries do not hold a charge well, they lose power rapidly just sitting on the shelf and take too long to charge. I also have found that longitivty is a problem. I have Black and Decker products in the past and their durability has been sadly lacking. I have found the Skil brand to be much better. What I would like to see is an indicator light that would let you know when the battery is fully charge and the ability of the battery to take a quick charge. I hope Black and Decker addresses these concerns."
2,Weak Batteries,"Here is my experience. I purchased a Black and Decker blower which is powered by these batteries. Followed the instructions on charging and had good results for the first 10 - 12 months of use.Now, I'm held at ransom every week by these batteries. I live in FL and depend on them heavily to get rid of the clippings on the sidewalk and the road.If they are not charged right up to the minute before needing them, they are unable to to do the job."
1,B&D Batteries Do Not Hold Up,"I bought one battery pack when I bought my new B&D drill in February 2007. I am a very light user and when the battery would not charge up in April '08 I bought a new battery, did the inital 9 hr. charge as the directions stated and the battery lasted about 20 seconds. Neither battery will charge up enough to use. Sorely disappointed. I am switching to Makita or DeWalt."
2,Inconsistant,"There seems to be different versions of this battery within the same part number, and I've yet to figure out how to tell them apart. Some of them hold a charge well (the older ones), others do not. If I didn't own 6 tools that use them, I'd never buy one again. I have 2 batteries that hold a good charge, even after being shelved for a couple days, others that must be charged before each use and run only for a few minutes. The different chargers also have widely varying degrees of effectiveness. If you do not already own tools from this system, I say to avoid it. I've done some research on this system, and B&D seems totally unwilling to divulge any information about how this system works."
4,FireStorm 18-Volt NiCad #3,"This is my third battery that I have purchased. They come in the mail fast as promised. From experience, they work great the first year; they hold a good charge and their power last for about 30 minutes of continuous work. This product is good for small jobs. Example, zero-lot yards or blowing off small porches. However, for larger yards, I would recommend an electric powered blower, or a gas powered blower."
3,Plan on replacing them with serious use,"I use these batteries with the B&D; chain saw. That may be more power hungry than some tools.When brand new, the saw really hums, wow! After 20 to 30 charges, though, the batteries seem to charge to about 70% of the ""out of the box"" capacity. I've had two that just died - would not hold a serious charge - within the Amazon product return time window (which they graciously replaced or refunded). Clearly there is some variability between individual batteries, but I'm guessing a max usable lifetime of 100 to 150 charges, if the battery makes it that long."
5,Black and Decker 18 volt battery,"This produsct is very good, good power, good life, easy to use, light weight, and so far, very reliable."
1,Black & Decker FSB18 FireStorm 18-volt NiCad Battery,Very disappointed in this battery. Does not hold much charge. Could not finish a perimeter of an area which is 40 by 60 ft. Past original equipment batteries lasted much longer. Would not recommend.I would be better off using a corded trimmer at this rate - cheaper than buying battery trimmer with ineffective batteries.
5,AWESOME BATTERY POWER,I NOW HAVE 5 OF THESE BATTERIES AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM..WHEN FULLY CHARGED THEY LAST CONTINUOUSLY FOR 30 MIN. EACH..I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITHT THE FIRE STORM BATTERY..IT WORKS!! I LOVE WEED EATING WITH THE BATTERY OPERATED WEED EATER...NO PULLING A CORD CONSTANTLY TO CRANK IT OR THE MESS WITH USING GAS AND OIL FOR THE GAS POWERED WEED EATERS...NOT TO MENTION THE SAVINGS IN GAS PRICES..
3,B&D Firestorm 18V original batteries suck,I have had my Firestorm 18V tools for several years. The batteries weren't great when I bought the tools and now they are almost useless. They don't hold a charge and even if you charge them just before you use them there is little chance they will last till even a short job is done. I am reluctant to buy new batteries considering these are NiCads in a lithium ion world. Why $70 bucks for new batteries when their history of usefulness is so poor. Perhaps the new ones are better but is it worth the risk. I wouldn't bother but I like the tools.
4,18 volt NiCad battery,"The fire storm drill is an excellent product. I have had the batteries less than 2 months but thus far they are performing well. The old batteries were not nicad, so i am inexperienced in the nicad realm. I can only hope that they are as reliable as the origionals."
2,Not for continuous use.,"I'm in the process of building a deck and had tons of screws to drive to hold down the deck boards. Well, things started off great but then went downhill fast. These batteries just aren't made for constant use. After a while I found myself sitting there waiting for the batteries to recharge. I was switching off between 2 of the 18v batteries and another B&D drill with 2 12v batteries. Ended up borrowing 2 more 18v batteries from a neighbor to get me going again while mine recharged. As an FYI, one of my 18v batrteries is the silver series which are supposed to be more powerful. Save your money, they're not not any better than the regular ones."
3,18 Volt FSB18 Battery,"Hopefully this replacement will last longer than the one year (and under 100 charges) of my original. If not, it will be time to read up on the warranty terms!"
3,NOT LABELED FIRE STORM AS SHOWN,"I AM NOT SURE IF I RECEIVED THE FIRE STORM OR NOT. I CERTAINLY ORDERED THAT BRAND NAME. I RETAINED THE CARD THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE BATTERIES....THEY HAVE A DESIGNATION OF HPB18. THERE ARE NO WORDS NOR DESIGNATIONS OF FIRE STORM ON THE BRAND VARIETY PACKING SLIP. THUS I WANT TO KNOW JUST EXACTLY WHAT I RECEIVED????HERB WELDON,"
3,Problematic Battery,"I bought my 18v cordless drill and it came with this battery pack. Unfortunately, when I attempted to charge it, it won't hold the charge. The B&D folks were really friendly about it, they told me where the nearest service center is for me to exchange the battery pack. Here's hoping the next one is able to hold a charge better than this one."
1,black and decker FSB18 battery,This battery went dead after 2 uses. It would not recharge even after using 2 different chargers. I had to junk it.
3,Review,The battery seems to be as good as it gets today. Battery technology needs improving. The battery last about one year. That seems adequate.
3,"Good battery, but no for me.",I had to return it for it was of a different type from what I needed. But seems to be good.
4,Fresh batteries,New batteries are amazing. They almost make the tool explode with power.What is the life span of a Black and Decker 18 volt battery? Will this be a yearly event or will these batteries outlast the original ones that came with the lawn tool?
5,18-volt battery pack,"This is a backup battery pack. I haven't used it yet, but the original pack is great."
1,Wrong size,"I just assumed this was the right battery since I had bought similar before and Amazon sent me a link to it. I opened the package before discovering it was the wrong size. It's still sitting in the ""peanuts"" in the workshop. What I really needed was the Firestorm 14.4v."
5,nice battery,I'm currently using this with the 18v 4pc combo set. It works just like all the rest...
4,B&D FSB18 Battery,The price was right but this is a cheaper battery than the ones that came with my tools. I have found out since that there are a few different models of these but I can't seem to find out just what the differences are. I sent my old batteries to a company called Primecell to get rebuilt and upgraded. It is a little expensive but they say that capacity and performance will be improved by at least 30%. I use my tools alot and better battery performance will be appreciated.
2,short life,I have found that much cheaper 18v batteries in cheaper tools last as long or longer than B&D batteries. Seems like B&D has designed their cordless tools to obtain their profits from the sale of battery replacement. I am switching to tools powered by lithium ion batteries.
2,Black & Decker RSB18 FireStorm 18-volt NiCad Battery,Disappointed with the short charge life of this battery. It seems that price goes up and quality goes down. Not really worth the money in my opinion.
1,serious power issues.,I picked up the Firestorm combo set about 6 years ago. We completely redid our kitchen and 2 bathrooms..also built a new dock. They have performed quite well. That being said the batteries finally gave out and I picked up some new ones. I'm not sure why but they are terrible. 20 minutes of work and they are ready to die. Maybe it's something I did..but I never babied the old batteries. It's a shame because the tools themselves served me well. I'm going to have to go with another brand.
2,So many versions of the same product number! The 2009 42-BM best so far for me.,"So many version of the same product number FSB18 Power Pack! I have owned & ordered many of these over the years from Amazon. I've had the best luck (recently) with the ones that have 2009 42-BM 415 etched on them. They have lasted the longest (1 year +). The 2009 37-BM 415 lasted only a few months. I always return/exchange with Amazon until I get a $35 battery that works correctly (90 days at least!). The warranty is 2 years though! I paid way too much for my edger, blower, and trimmer. You should all send yours back within the return policy to exchange. Amazon returns back to Black and Decker and gets credit. Black and Decker will make a better battery once they get all of these back! So don't feel bad... send it back!My old 2006 battery lasted 3 years until I recycled/disposed of. They made them better back then!! They most have found a cheap manufacture that is screwing them (well us)."
2,"Light weight, lousy sticking; Stanley Tools ? what happened?","I bought these as a second thought after buying the much cheaper ""Round White Plastic Self-Adhesive Utility Hook - 4Pk ... by InterDesign . Their hooks are BY FAR BETTER. I was shocked. I have used Stanley Tools for half a decade. I never ever ever imagined a cheapo brand of any item would be better. Man, was I wrong.Do yourself a BIG favor. Leave these on the shelf at Amazon. Buy the cheaper ones. The hook feels and seems stronger, the sticker is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the wimpy sticker on the Stanley brand. I hung a simple wood handle kitchen broom on it and it fell after three days. I still have a Swifter Sweeper hanging off the cheapo hook not even a hint of it falling off, peeling away, or breaking the hook.I just trashed the remaining Stanley hooks, they look almost identical, but I did not want to make the mistake of keeping that Stanley junk."
5,Performance accesories zr2 body lift,Great product. Easy to install and comes with everything you need to complete the lift.
1,Product does not live up to title.,"It is anything but ""heavy duty."" My vinyl is on a boat and is heavily soiled and this product did not touch it. Went with Simple Green, elbow grease and a scrubby and it worked better."
4,As described.,"Arrived one time and works fine, Seems to clean well. Have not had chance to use much but look forward to more use in the Spring."
2,Hope Springs Enternal (But Sometimes Gives False Positives),"Citing the great line from Road House: ""I thought you'd be taller"", I remember this work being taller in the seventies. Punk ruined me, and though Sparks can validly be seen as a precursor of Punk, I find this work essentially unlistenable. In their defense they have not turned into complete assclowns such as has Elvis Costello (you know I'm right!), or Van Morrison; but let's not go there. Buy it for Muff Winwood's production; but better still, buy the Butthole Surfers and join the 21st. Century."
5,Kimono Supremo,"When first released in the early 70's, I always was listening to it. I remember playing it so much that there was a skip on ""This town ain't big enough"" and I just got used to hearing it. It always surprises me when I listen to the song on CD and I do not hear the expected skip. This album is still great and, unfortunately, nothing done by the Maels has even come close to the genius of this recording. One thing that is almost never mentioned about the recording is the crisp, clear guitar sound. The songs are fun, sometimes sad, and always melodic. My favorites are ""Amateur Hour"" and ""Hasta Manana Monsieur."""
5,Big In England!,"Forget about the Mael brothers for a moment - sure Russell's falsetto is (ahem...) interesting, and Ron's robotic Hitler shtick provides for a few laughs - but behind the witty lyrics and arrangements, the boys always had, at least in the early days, a largely unheralded rockin' band behind them, perhaps no more so than on ""Kimono My House."" This is most evident on songs like ""This Town Ain't Big Enough,"" ""Amateur Hour,"" and ""Talent Is An Asset."" Adrian Fisher, put down that Les Paul and stand up and be counted!"
3,I'm not impressed.,"My son got the Clubhouse and all the figures for his birthday. He loves them but considering it cost about $90 to get everything to make a complete Mickey Mouse Clubhouse set, this toy does not do enough to keep a child entertained. I feel bad for making my mother spend the money on this as a gift to her grandson."
2,Basically a Biography of Robert Devereux Earl of Essex,"I brought this one from just the title knowing the author was one I liked, so your personal rating maybe much higher.Sheila Bishop writes some excellent Regency romancies, this isn't one of them.If you like historical tales of real people then this book may appeal. It deals with both Richard and his sister Penelope Rich, and deals with the last 5 years of his life. The tale is set in 1596 and I suspect a fair bit of work went into the research. I wondered about the word ""moppet"" since Sheila Bishop's other books are usually accurate so looked it up, first recorded use in the Oxford dictionary 1601 so spot on. A mixture of biography and a writer using words and actions to tell a tale."
2,"Item works as specified, WirelessGarden has terrible customer service.",I needed the Cantenna for an urgent product I was working on and mentioned this in my order comments to Wireless Garden. It took them a full 7 days from my order date to ship it out. I received it 11 days after my order. I sent a message to them asking if they could speed things along with no response. Bummer #1Bummer #2 is that it didn't come with the rptnc adapter mentioned as something included in this package. I need this to connect to my Linksys WRT54G. Now I need to go to RadioShack and hope they have one.
2,Wireless Garden SCB10 12 dBi Super Cantenna,really wasn't powerful enough for me. I think it would work alright if i were closer to the house.
1,WiFi user,"I purchased this item in hopes of connecting my house to my work building. I was disappointed by the quality of the item. The metal is very thin and dents easily. Also, it was not weather resistant and so I wasn't able to mount it anywhere to achieve a good signal. The N connector is also very cheap.There are better cantennas on the market. I went to [...] and found a better quality unit that is weather resistant and much more durable. I am able to mount it outside to get the signal I needed. It was a much better value and the tech support and customer service was excellent!"
3,My expectations were higher,"I really thought that I would get a five bar signal for my laptop,the advertising says 12dbi-thatWell It didnt come out like that, I only get 3 which is ok to connect andbrowse on the internet, but not to watch movies and download videos.Sometimes it looses the signal, so I have to reconnect it again, however itworks well most of the time, I am planning to buy an extension so I can moveit outdoors and get the full signal"
4,SWEEEEET free internet,We got our cantenna last month and were able to directly connect it to our belkin wireless modem on the back of our desktop computer. all it took was unscrewing the tiny antenna the card came with and screwing on the cable to the cantenna. While weather and the direction you have the cantenna does affect the reception you recieve it over all is a great product.The only thing that sucks about the cantenna is the length of the cable it comes with. since ours connects towards the bottom of the back of the computer tower it doesnt leave much room to adjust where the cantenna sits on the desk.
1,Do not order from wireless garden.,"I would stay away from wireless garden. I ordered the super cantenna from wireless garden and it arrived on time but without the rptnc adapter which is needed for a linksys router. The list of contents on the box says it should be included but was not. I have left several messages with their sales, tech support, and billing department over the last week and no one has returned my call or email. I guess I should of just built my own."
4,Whimsical Yet Realistic,"This book is probably one of the most fascinating ones I've ever read just because of the sheer way it is written. It is not written like most books and it often seems as if the writer is untrained yet they weave a spell. The book is based on realism yet it turns into these fantastical things like fairies, angels, and spirits! It is much easier also to read the 5 books in a row rather than trying to read one and then buy the next one ect."
1,Absolutely horrendous!,"My aunt sent me this book with a bunch of others she was getting rid of. After discovering that it was a book of retold fairy tales, I quickly began to read it. 5 pages later, however, I realized just why my aunt had gotten rid of it. It's awful! With all due respect to those who liked the book, it has absolutely no depth nor purpose. This book is a complete waste of time."
2,Dont bother,"From looking at the cover of this book it looks really good. But the story in it is really awful. I am not even finished with the book. i xant stay focused on the book for more than a minute. I have no idea what is going on. If the stupid author would stop making so many simili's and methaphors, maybe i could figure out what is going on.I read hundreds of pages a week and this is by far the worst book i have read in a long time. i am so glad that i dont own it."
1,Shallow and pointless,"I have to say, this book is far by the worse story that I have ever read. Every character is shallow and has they're own perfect storybook happy ending. I espicially hate the ""love at first sight"" with every character and the long, tedious paragraphs jam-packed with metaphors and simlies. Francesca Lia Block has obviously no idea what writing is about, nor how to do this. I am appalled that this has so many good reviews for such a shallow book. The plot is odd and twisted and the characters add absolutely no flavor. Are not your characters meant to run the story by some means, not just the story?"
5,This book was slinkster-cool.,"I'm 13 and I just started reading books by BLOCK. I have to say I'm very impressed, though. She writes like no other and says things that seem to mean one thing, but really makes you think about something else. Her words paint an awesome picture of these people's lives, feelings and expressions. I feel like I know them myself. My favorite book WEETZIE BAT and I would definately reccomend it to anyone with a desire to read something new."
4,Strange Angels,I really do love and enjoy this book. It's not for every one because it's a bit off beat. I really like the descriptions and relationships that build up in this story.
4,Beautiful,"With a luminous magical realism style, Block tells the stories of Weetzie Bat and her family and friends in the five books collected here. Usually marketed for a young adult audience, the books are more for the young at heart, covering adult themes like AIDS, racism, and sex. These heartwarming books overall tell about what a family really is: a group of people who care about each other through it all. ... It's the story of a young gay boy trying to find another like him, as well as his place in his family and the world."
5,"Fairy Tale meets LSD meets surf culture, in the best way possible.","I read the Weetzie Bat books as a teenager and they stuck with me for so many years, even after I'd lost track of the hardcopies - so I had to buy this kindle edition! They are as whimsical and entertaining and enlightening as I remember. Block's storytelling is simply decadent. She creates a beautiful version of reality that you can easily drown in."
4,Original and gritty feeling to writing.,"With this series I was hoping for more fantasy. While there is some there is also a piece of reality fitting into the story. The world of Weezie Bat is kinda of gritty and reminds of reading a Poppy Z. Brite book but less graphic. I thought because looking at covers there was fairies in the book and there are not fantasy fairies.. I wish there was more about Weezie's daughterl, Witch Baby. I felt I was itching to know more about her witch or djinn power."
4,good,"Well i havent quite finished this book yet... but so far it is kinda confusing. It is a really good book tho. It has love in different kinds of places. It tells about homosexuals, regular love, and different kinds of things about finding yourself and who you are. But i do plan on reading this book fully. It seems very good and the author is great. I plan on reading Girl Goddess #9."
5,five billion stars,"I wanted to cry when this book was over-but instead I just read it again, and again. When you read this book you feel like you're there watching the slinkster cool family living in LA which fracesca lia block paints vividly. This is my favorite book!"
3,Just didn't like it,"Ok, I did not enjoy reading this book. Honestly, I disliked the writing style and the names the characters had, My secret agent lover man, in particular, were stupid. I feel like I missed the big point. Yes these books show a most unusal group of people struggling together and living as a family. I guess with this book either you get it or you don't. Some people seem to love this book, or these books I should say. Personally, I really just didn't like the books at all. Sure there are many postives that I could list, but I still feel like gee, I really did not derive enjoyment from this book.So, all you people out there who love these books, good for you. I guess I'm missing out."
2,Weirdo central,I'm not saying this book wasn't interesting or anything I'd just like to point a very obvious fact this book is umm. kinda weird. But over all it is a great read. Justbe prepared to umm. dal with the weirdness.
2,Unrealistic.,"I found the book a little hard to believe. What was the point? It was too unrealisitc. Striking it rich, when My Secret Agent Lover Man appears out of nowhere. Yes, it was a wish-come-true, but a genie? The book doesn't explain the details. It feels like a hollow book, no meaning. I think that some people, who are more into this type of stuff may enjoy it, but I found it to be just a bunch of hocus pocus. Good thing I got it at the library first."
2,Fallen Angels is more like it,"I found this book tedious and disappointing in its glorification of social dysfunction and hollywood glamour. I read about half before I put it down for good. Don't bother, unless you're a druggie wannabe."
5,Dangerous Angels Rates 1000 Stars!,This is not just a book for young adults. I read this book when I was 21 and I fell in love with it. Please read this book; it will open your mind and change your life. Francesca Lia Block is simply marvelous.
5,"Not an overprotective parent, but a bookworm teen","In a world wherereality is so harsh that none can escape the torments of it, why can't we have an escape? Parents, Im a teenager, I know, WE KNOW ABOUT THESE SUBJECTS! Sex, drugs, homosexuality, aren't they all common conversation ground for teenagers? Isn't it possible that we don't need any more shielding from the world? FLB takes us into a world where nothing is hidden, but there are also the touchs of fantasy that we all wish we could grab. By reading this book, and coming into Weetzie Bat's world we are not shockingly finding out about these matters! All of these books are treasures, an insight to what the world really is. Instead of focusing on the troubles of the world, FLB shows us the troubles of the people in that world."
5,Make Magic and Find an Angel...*/^i^\*,"This book has become my bible. I think I've read it 8 times in six months. It's almost become an escape for me. When life depresses me, I read about Weetzie & Co., and I see that they go through hard times, but things turn out all right if you have love in your heart. I always feel rays of hope throughout my soul after reading it. I remember that although the world is full of pain, there is so much good in it as well. I've recommended it to about a million people, because it is the best book I have ever read. I wish I could move into their house in the canyon and live in the place where it's hot and cool, glam and slam, angels and devils, Los Angeles."
4,Redmond Wastebasket,Great wastebasket. I needed a narrow one next to my bed and this did the trick. Color is dark mahogany as shown. I plan to purchase another one for the other side of the room. Only issue was price but I rationalized it because size and color were what I needed.
2,Okay - not great,What they don't tell you in the description is that the bottom piece does not fit properly - resulting in gaps at each of the 4 corners of the bottom of the waste basket. The solution was to put in a cheap plastic tray in the bottom. It does not look good at all. I'm going to return it.
5,Articulating Mounts,"I installed the mount into a TV Box (47W x 33H x 35D) above my fireplace (This mount works perfect in this area!!). It took me approximately 2.0 hours to completely install starting from finding the studs to watching a movie. I have to admit I was extremely hesitant to suspend my 42"" Pany in the air. For some reason I just did not trust the mount and wall studs.Well, once I finished installing the mount I decided to give it the ultimate weight test...yep all 180 lbs. of me decided to hang from the mount fully articulated (I have medical insurance my plasma doesn't...extreme YEA). I suspended myself for a good minute...I never heard a creak, crack or popping sound. I figured that if the mount could withstand my weight then the 80 lbs. plasma would be OK.It's installed...people who come over love it...Although I do not really articulate and/or swivel the TV, the times that I did have made the movie that much more enjoyable."
3,United States bashing,"I enjoyed the humor in this book, and others by the same author. Keep in mind this is a CANADIAN author who has less than subtle digs at anything from the United States as being against her country and inferior. So much for fair trade. U.S. bashing should not be in fiction. Her main character Polly, smokes dope, lives in a cabin with no electricity or plumbing and has no ambition to improve yet we are to feel some sympathy. At first the book was amusing but as it went on I felt sorry for Polly and how she has gone no where with no thought to change. Very hard to relate to or feel fondness for a main character who is so strange."
2,Haynes is the only game in town but it stinks.,"If you are into disassembling your entire engine to get to a piece in the logical sequence of a teardown, this might be for you. Terrible pictures and the age old deconstruction approach to every repair make the Jaguar online forums a much better resource if something is broken on your kitty."
4,"lots to like, wish more breeds were pictured","This book has nice, large photos of chickens. The author's stated aim is exploring the world of exhibition poultry. The majority of the photos are of the more crazy looking chickens, including Polish types, cochins, games, frizzles, etc.I got this book from the library, hoping to see clear photos of a wide variety of old-fashioned dual-purpose breeds (Dominiques, Orps, Rocks, etc.). It didn't really meet that need, but was still enjoyable. It you love the crested breeds and ""fancy feathers"" you will enjoy this book. I think the author's new book ""Extra Extraordinary Chickens"" may be better, with many added photos and additional breeds. (I haven't seen that one.)"
5,Awesome Coffee Table Book!,"Excellent quality, stunning photos, makes a great coffee table book and topic of conversation! I never get tired of turning the pages, you can't help but laugh at the funny photos. The photography is awesome. Be sure to get the matching wall calendar, it's just as entertaining!"
2,Way to small,"I was disapointed in the size, it is 4""by 5"". It is not fun to look at as it is to small to share with a nother person, unless they sit in my lap. I have seen the large book and it is wonderful. My bust that I did not know what a CHUNKY book is. Thanks COLLEEN"
3,More Chickens!,"I got this for a friend as a birthday present. There are a lot of beautiful pictures of chickens. (I used to think that was an oxymoron, but the pictures really are great.) My biggest complaint is that the book is really tiny! (I didn't notice this in the product description when I ordered it.) It's less than 5""x5""x1"" so if you're sending it as a gift keep that in mind. It's definitely not a coffee table type book dues to its size."
3,Don't Buy Used,The information in the book is very helpful but do not buy the book used if you want to take full advantage of what it has to offer. A majority of the book is centered around the results of their online strength finder accessed with a code in the book jacket that can only be used once.
4,"Now, Discover Your Strengths","As a student in high school, I was assigned this book to read as extra credit over Winter Break. When I first began to read I wondered how the book could relate to my life right now. I don't work at an office and I certainly don't hire employees. As I began to read, I enjoyed the knowledge that the book shared with me. It was an interesting way to view life, especially focusing on an individual's strengths. My favorite part was the StrengthsFinder. It was very helpful in letting me see what talents a program thought I expressed. After reading the book and taking the online survey, my confidence grew and I was able to focus on my strengths more. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, in any career, at any age."
5,"Now, Discover Your Strengths","This item was pruchased per request of someone in the department. I wil assume they were satisfied. i am the person who does the ordering for the departmet, not the person using the item."
1,Unhappy customer,"Paid for book 'Now, Discover your Strengths' being used in a study group. Was to come with a certain code in order to fill form on strengths. No code in the book. Seller offered to credit account in August, have not seen a credit on my account yet (October)."
4,Good concept... Helped discover strengths,"This book was very well written. I agree totally that a lot of the time we spend too much time on our weaknesses. I did not give it 5 stars because I think it downplayed weaknesses too much. Although we should not spend too much time on weaknesses, we should have a plan to strive to improve them especially if they are affecting our performance on the job. I think the biggest issue with most is that many people are in jobs that don't line up with their strengths. I am going to have my teenage son take the survey to be able to pin point his strenghts. Hopefully he can find a job fomr the beginning of his career that fits with his stengths. Overall the book was very helpful. I purchased one of each of my staff."
3,"Don't buy this book ""used""...there is a code in the back...","Here is another book that I had to purchase twice---once ""used"", once ""new"". When I had purchased the book I did not know that I would need to take the ""survey"" for my class. The book I had purchased had a code to input when going online to take the survey. The code was invalid in that it was already used. If you are taking a class, and they expect you to write a paper based on the results of the online survey...YOU HAD BETTER PURCHASE A NEW COPY...."
4,Great for working with volunteers,"Overall this book is a quick and simple read that includes access to the Gallup's web strength analysis tool. This alone is worth the purchase for people you may lead volunteers in an organization, who may have no real appreciation for their own abilities. It will also help you to make effective use of people's talents and avoid organizational burnout. Do not expect depth here as the book only covers the surface. Knowing and using a tool such as Myers-Briggs will help you even more."
4,Requires effort to employ...like anythiing else,"I liked this book. It will not solve all of your life's problems, or make you an instant success. But, it provides useful information derived from polls, interviews and a lot of refining that helps you to realize that if you are to succeed, you need to do what you do best and ""manage"" your weaknesses. This can be accomplished through a solid staff that complement one another with their strengths. If it's not good for anything else, it sheds light on other peoples' tendencies and their root causes. I gave the book four instead of five stars because a few more ""how should you use this everyday"" examples would have been helpful. But, again, if you expect to get anything from the book, you should plan to work."
4,Good book,It's a good book. I liked the test and the way the authors show how we should deal with our talents. I just didn't like the description of each talent. I think that this part of the book could be better.
2,"Great book, False advertisement",Although this was a great read the book wasn't at all new. There is a strengths test that goes along with the book and this was the only reason I really ordered the book. I contacted the seller and they gave me a refund and I got to keep the book but unfortunately I still haven't been able to take my test for it. Bummer guess I shouldn't have bought it from amazon. Sad face......
4,The first step towards greatness,"Ask anyone including your self, What your top natural talents are and what do they do for you in your current roll? Very few will answer something specific; most of us cannot say in what thins we can bring consistent, near perfect performance that can be productively applied.This book is the first of its kind, it can reveal for you your top 5 talents and put them into perspective for you. This exercise was helpfull to me in order to arrange my priorities in learning, my job and life in general.If you dont know what you are made of, you have a slim chance to trsnform your life into something great. Unless you are the type of person that just follow your gut, like a musician; you can get caught up in a job that wont lead you very far.I have use this knoledge along with the other books in this series and I see my future with more clarity, with more potential. MUST HAVE."
2,Repetitively obnoxious,"Self-help or not, as I read this book I felt that I was being ""talked down to"". The author probably would make an excellent kindergarten teacher, because only there is teaching by repetition considered an option. I feel that all the ""advice"" could have been said in about 10 pages or so.I understand, however, that there are some people who enjoy reading such books and perhaps my opinion is tainted by the fact that I have not read that many ""self-help"" books. But I am a regular ""inspiration book"" reader, and I have been more inspired by ""Jack: Straight from the Gut"", ""A Passion to Win"", etc.I probably would have finished reading this book had I not gotten tired of the redundancy. This may be a good read if you have recently broken your leg and need something to pass the time. For me, I have a better source of nagging: my wife."
1,The only thing this book has going for it is the CD-Rom.,"Cute, in other words, but not worth the paper it's printed on in terms of being a useful resource for people wanting to change their lives. The authors obviously show a remarkable strength in the area of making money, if you decide to buy this book. (By the way, if you get it used, odds are the CD-Rom and its mysterious # won't work for you.)"
2,Assessment lacking,The book had some good insights. The on-line assessment was lame and unhelpful. Not sure there is a lot of value in it all by itself. These guys will try to suck you into a maze of additional products and services. None seem to be complete without several additional steps.
3,"Now, Discover Your Strengths","This book is well written and very easy to get through. The central thesis of bringing focus to individual strengths, and thereby not focusing on weaknesses, is supported with information from Gallup surveys.The web exercise that is required to identify your strengths is easy to use, but a little confusing as it appears that there is a later version of this book available and it is accompanied by some pricey consulting/coaching services.I'd recommend this as an addition to the reading lists of any 20somethings who are entering the working world, or even if you are not."
5,One of the most accessible and useful business books ever,"If you are like me, and want to avoid the ""flavor of the month"" type of business book, then you will love this one.First, it is short and well-written, which makes the information very accessible.Next, it is actually based on ""facts"" - actually thousands of interveiws that the Gallup organization has conducted over several years.Finally, it was fascinating to log into their website and run the test on Strength Finder. My business partner and co-founder said that they nailed me!I would strongly recommend this book to any manager or aspiring manager."
2,Shallow,"The basic premise of the book is great, and the on-line tool is useful. However, there is very little discussion of how to use these strengths. Also, I tend to be skeptical of the results when I'm not allowed to complete the survey again, 6 months or a year later, unless of course I buy another copy of the book!"
4,JP's Recommended Reading,I truly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to applying what I learned to how i do things moving forward.
5,Great for self awareness,Loved this book. Have since bought it for loved ones and customers as gifts.It's a great tool to learn more about yourself and others.
3,The VERY FIRST BOOK is the best!,"In reading some of the reviews about this book people seem to go back to one reoccuring theme which embraces the initial concept of relying on your strengths for success. That premise is the cornerstone of the book, but it gets bogged down from there with semantics. You MUST go back to Donald Clifton's very first book...""Soar With Your Strengths"", written about ten years ago. This is the book that gives the general parameters of their original concept and although broad in scope, is very effective in changing your outlook on life. As someone who makes a living out of speaking to people, I use this book as the premise of my presentations and you'd be amazed how overwhelmed people are when they hear the principals of that first book. Although this book has some good moments, it doesn't justify the work. Give people the premise and let them apply it to their own lives. In the end, the authors had it right the very first time."
1,Don't buy this book used/second hand,"In order to take the online test you have to enter a unique number printed at the back of the book. If someone else has used it, you're stuck, as I found to my cost. The publisher will not provide you with another one."
4,MUST BUY NEW,"This is a great book, I recommend it to all.VERY IMPORTANT. You must buy this book new in order to take the online test. I purchased a used book through the marketplace (always and excellent experience by the way) so the code has already been used. Now I have to spend the money to buy a new one just to take the test. In this case buying used does not save you anything."
1,"Now, Discover Your Strengths",DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK USED!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK USED!!!!There is a code in this book that is needed to take a test and understand more than half of this book and how it applies to you personally. This code is used at a website to find out your strengths and is only valid for a one time use. If you purchase this book used your chances of that code already being used are very high. You will then need to get a new copy of the book if you want to take the test. WHAT A WASTE!
1,Common Authors - Why,This book is very expensive and the authors tell you that taking multiple surveys are helpful in the book. They actually do not let you take the surveys multiple times and do not return your phonecalls when you leave a message on the 800 number that they list in the book. Do not waste your money until they allow more tests - especially for the price that they charge! You can buy 2 or 3 other good books for the price of this one.
2,Huge Disappointment,"This is my first time to write a review after buying dozens of books through Amazon. But a contrary opinion is needed here.The premise was great: working on our strengths is more important than focusing on our weaknesses. The first 2/3 of the book repeated this idea in various ways. That is great, but I already believed that or I would not have purchased the book.Almost 1/3 was spent explaining how to manage people by understanding the strengths of your employees. A few pages in between explained the profiles that are derived from the online test. These pages are descriptive, but quite general. They sound like horoscopes from the newspaper. But no space was spent on how to apply the descriptions of the strength profiles. And that is what I came expecting to learn."
2,Not sufficient,"Well this book is ok if you already have a successful career and you just want to fine tune some management issues. Oddly, this book ignores people looking for a new direction, new career. If you have a nagging sense that there may be something else you should be doing with your life, this book will not help. Very disapponting."
1,Needed this book for class- code was NO GOOD!,"I ordered this book- NEW- and received it in time for needing to take the assessment. This book is required for the Business class I am taking. I went to enter the code and it said it had already been used! I am very P-O'd because a great deal of my grade is resting on my assessment and how I enterpet it. I don't know if I can get a replacement- I emailed the seller- I doubt there is anything that can be done. I don't have money to go purchase this again... I am frustrated because it IS a good book- but I feel it's not worth it if you can't take the assessment. There could be a better way to distribute the code. Or maybe the book should be SEALED or something. Now, I will probably fail this course."
1,Great Premise No Follow-Thru,I heard great things about this book and enjoyed the introduction as well as the premise. The problem I found is that a)3 of the 5 Questionnaire results did NOT match my description b)The discussion of the results and the application of the purported strengths was lacking and not helpful.
1,cannot use the code,"the code packet came intact however the code does not work. And I'm sure that I put it in correctly.I guess it's probably the publisher's fault rather than amazon's. If their code generator has been cracked, then it's a huge problem."
2,Strengths Finder test not useful,"I have read the book and taken the test. While the concept is sound (focus and develop your strengths, do only damage control on your weaknesses), the test does not reveal anything that could be applicable to my work. Many of the 180 questions are just simply asking you where your strengths are and then telling you the same thing in the result. The applicability of the result is very low. 3 out of 5 of my strenght mean that I like to think, the 4th means that I feel everything is connected (how is that a strenght?) and the 5th is that I like to collect things (ideas, stuff). I don't feel this book and especially the test is worth the money nor the time. On the other hand I would be genuinely interested in hearing from someone who found the test useful in his/her life."
5,"Now, Discover Your Strengths = Your Greatest Talents at Work","Brilliant. Readable. Engaging. Empowering.I was originally introduced to this work through Kristine Gunn of www.HighVelocityTraining.com.It immediately provided hope that my inherent ideas about how to work with people to help them perform (and internally do the same) could be applied today.An inspiring work that truly helps you find the path to your own inherent success traits. A phenomenal book, and the integrated online test and report are vital to helping you return to center when you find yourself in the weeds, wondering why you're working so hard and not having fun.To your greatest success and most fulfilling work.Mark Alan Effinger,RichContent.comThoughtOffice.com"
2,A self help book that didn't help me at all,"The title implies that it will help YOU discover and use YOUR strengths, but it is actually more of a management/hiring book- it helps you place other people to use THEIR strengths effectively. Since I am in sales, (and only have one assistant who doesn't need much managing) it wasn't much of a help. The personality test wasn't even helpful. The book recommends that you use it to ""hone your strengths"" and then it doesn't tell you how to go about doing that. If I were managing 20 or so employees and had to make a lot of hiring decisions it might have been helpful- it did discuss how to match people with different talents to appropriate jobs. Since I am not- it was a total waste of time and money."
1,Caution on buying this particular book used.,"The major feature of this book is that you can go online and take a test to identify your strengths. This is key to reading this book. If you purchase this book used,(as I did) this will not be an option for you. There is a one-time use code inside the book that will not be valid if you purchase this item used. LET THE BUYER BE INFORMED THAT USED BOOKS ARE USELESS."
1,Now Discover Your Strenghts,"I was told this product was brand new and it definitely wasn't, the code the book comes with was already used so I was unable to take the Strengths Profile that is supposed to come with it. I am not happy"
1,Invalid Code,"I bought the book new from Amazon, and my code is invalid/had already been used...From looking at previous reviews I saw this problem happened to a handful of people, I guess I am now one of those people. This sucks."
1,Is it here yet?,I ordered this book about a week ago and it just shipped and it says that it is estimated that it will take 3 weeks to get to me!!! This is ridiculous. Never ordering from them again!
1,Book is great but buying it from Amazon was not,"The book is great but buying it from Amazon was not. There is a code inside the spine of the dust jacket. I bought the book as ""new"" but there was no code in the back to take the online test at the end of the book. I returned the book and got a refund but if I didn't know about the code I would have read 1/2 the book before learing about the code and I don't know how Amazon would have handled a returned 1/2 read book."
2,remedial,"this is a fine book for those who've never done a self analysis course or personality test. unfortunately, that's all this really is and the multiple references to sales and the word ""empathy"" make it clear that the authors were lazy in their providing the depth that this topic deserves. ""now, break the rules"" was infinitely better than this half written effort to make more money."
3,Feedback,"I only bought this book to get the number off the inside jacket to take the assessment--I did not really read it much. What I did read seemed to have a very corporate thrust which was not my preference. Overall, this assessment has some valuable merit and I recommend it to anyone."
4,Collects Dust VERY well,haven't opened it since I got it. Makes a great paperweight and serves as an excellent converation piece when visitors come into my office.
2,Not easy reading,"I like to read the introduction of a book, it gives me an idea of where the author is headed. This introduction was not a strong intro to the book, therefore I did not finish reading. I did not care for the writing style because it did not capture my attention."
5,All Managers Should read this book,"This book goes along with StrengthFinders by Rath. I enjoyed this book. I agree focusing on an employees strengths are key. In the book, Elephants Can't Change but Leopards can!!! it talks about the Now, Discover your Strengths book and how it can be implemented by Management."
5,"Now, Discover Your Strengths",This is an excellent book for all levels of managers. I am reading the book and reviewing it with the managers in my portfolio. Not only has it been helpful to me to learn their strengths it has been a real eye opener to them to realize how their strengths effect their work and how they have been successful in the work they do. I think it has also given them confidence in knowing they don't have to fix their weakness but grow their strengths. They are all very eager to learn the strengths of the people on their teams. I would highly recommend this book.
4,An important business book,"The book provides some good insights on individual performance. Given that many business managers have read the book, at minimum it is useful to understand the language and concepts introduced.A key take away is that a particular strength is developed by a combination of talent, skills, and knowledge. Talent is one's naturally recurring patterns of thought that is based on how your brain is wired. According to neuropsychology, this is pretty much fixed by the time one is in his/her teens. The other two, skills and knowledge can be learned over the course of one's life. So the key is to determine what one's talents are and develop those to achieve excellence.An interesting read overall."
1,Strengths Finder Profiler access code was not valid.,"I purchased this book NEW ten months ago and finally got the chance to take the Strengths Finder Profile online. When I attempted to register the access code listed on the inside jacket of the book, I received the following error: ""The access code you entered has already been registered or is invalid. Please enter an unused and valid access code or re-enter this code if you think you may have mistyped it.""I bought this book new from Amazon. The access code should have been valid. Since the time frame is beyond the return window, I cannot return it for an exchange. I bought the book so that I could take the Profile online. Very disappointing!If you purchase this book new and are interested in the online Strengths Finder Profile, be sure to register the access code as soon as possible, so that you can return it if the code is no longer valid."
3,GREAT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A VARIETY OF STRENGTHS,"I like this book because it is one of the first books for management that places a value on difference rather than on having all employees fit a cookie-cutter model. This is great for so many of my clients who feel ""stuck"" precisely because they don't feel the strengths they have are valued in the workplace. For example, Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to pick just one) do not want to climb only one career ladder but would rather use their love of learning to move from one focus area to another.I was disturbed, however, by the fact that each person who wants to take the inventory test to identify more of their strengths has to buy the book. When one client got the book from the library, he couldn't take the test because he didn't have his own personal entry number. Another wanted her adult children to take it, but why should she have to buy four copies?"
3,"Frankly, Not Worth Your Time","The strengths survey was interesting but didn't really tell me anything about myself that I didn't already know. Most of us know ourselves well enough to figure out what our strengths are. I suggest sitting down with a good glass of wine and give this some thought rather than wasting a little money and a bit more time sitting through this book.Bottom line, I wouldn't bother wasting your time with this book. The basic premise is sound, focus on your strengths. The book basically spends page after page rehashing this theme but not much more.So, think about your strengths. Are you compassionate, a competitor, a thinker, empathetic, etc.? Look for work that will utilize these strengths. Live a happier and more productive life.There you have it."
1,Another fad self-help book,"I read Now, Discover Your Strengths today, and took the ""StrengthsFinder"" quiz. Circuit City is in love with this book, and they give a copy to every employee.Of the five ""themes"" which ostensibly are my strongest talents, two are correct, one is so-so, and two are absurdly wrong.Like most personality tests and fad self-help books, this one is 30% common sense, 30% BS, and 40% a sales pitch for the publisher's other products. Don't waste your time."
2,Does not live upto the expectations,"I bought this book after reading the reviews here. I expected in depth analysis of each strengths and possibly tips on how to build up on to those strengths and all I got was a short descrition of top 5 strengths and nothing more. Most of the book is about the theory that using one's strengths is better than overcoming one's weaknesses. The book had been much better if only a chapter or two were devoted to it and rest were left for an in-depth analysis of those strengths. If you can get hold of the code off the jacket of the book and take the test online, then the book is worthless."
3,Basic Selfhelp book,"Another book telling you what your strenghts are in the work place. This book was on the right tracks with my strenghts but it was off in ceartian places, also you can only use the code twice to take the online test."
2,"What a disappointment, but","I know I should not complain about the fact that it was not the seller's obligation to let the buyer know that it is useless to use internet support to find out ""strength"" if the book is used one. Still, it is a big disappointment to find out the fact which used book means nothing to get support from the author."
4,"NOW, Discover Your Strengths",This book is excellent. It motivates the reader to want to exercise those things that the reader already does well. It stimulates that person to learn how to produce an excellent performance consistently.
2,Go straight to the last chapter and forget the rest,"Very dissapointed as to what the title leads you to believe about the book. Though the authors have done a tremendous amount of research, it flaws in 2 major issues which it forgets:a) the profile though quite specific, is similar to other profiles out thereb) 90% of the book is about why we should concentrate on our strenghts. Now lets face it, if you are a small business person like me who wants to grow his business, i already understand that i should be concentrating and exploring my strenghts and that of my organisation. I dont think i need to go thru the majority of the book to learn the concept.If you are a small business owner like me who wants the ""how to"", just read chapter 7 which goes to practical issues. If on the other hand you have nothing else to do, then yes do go ahead."
4,Marketing Excellence-Yes! New Information-?,"This book is an excellent illustration of the Gallup Organization's ability to market data as ""knowledge"". Today we seem to be so enamored of huge statistical databases that we assume better conclusions come from analyzing more information, in newer and more complex ways. When I finished reading this book, and taking the online ""Signature Themes"" profile evaluation I was struck by the enormity of my tranquilized obviousness. Everything I ""learned"" from this book I already knew, other than the valuable marketing lesson of how they got me to buy it!"
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,This book is based completly on an on-line quiz. My wife bought this book for me used and they will not let me take the quiz. I talked with customer support and they told me to buy a new book making my current book useless.
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this book from Amazon and I guess that it was used. The value of this book is an on-line strenghts assessment that is good for one user only. I contacted the company and told them I was not able to log on. They told me that the password they gave me was already used and I was not eligible to take the assessment. They could not help me since I didn't do enough due diligence before buying the book. ""Buyer beware.""This book has very little information without the on-line assessment and becomes worthless to anyone other than the original purchaser.I would be very wary about buying anything by marcus buckingham."
1,DO NOT BUY USED!!!!!!!,"This book is completely useless if bought used. Access code needed to take profile. Just go buy it at a book store, Amazon should tell buyers about this!!!!"
1,Ripped OFF!,"Before buying this book second hand, there should be a warning, that you will not be able to use code found on the inside of the paper cover to take the strengths finder profile online. I feel that I spent money for nothing and ripped off! I feel used! There is also no information on how to be able to go online and pay to take the profile. If you buy a second hand book, and find a way to pay to take the profile online, you will probably have spent more than if you had bought a brand new book."
3,"ok, but what now?","product explains in detail what strengths and weaknesses are. It gives many examples of different types and weaknesses and you can go on line and find out what your strengths are. At the end of the CD's, I found myself saying; ""ok, what now? What do I do now that I know my strengths""?"
1,Access Code doesn't work,"Disappointed because the Access Code didn't work, it said it had already been used. I bought the book new. I tried emailing the comapany several times, but did not have any response at all. Very disappointed."
2,code problem,"Bought this book in April and it was in excellent condition. The book comes with an online code that I am just now accessing. However, the code does not work and now I am in a tight bind with my homework."
3,Make sure it is NEW,"MAKE SURE the book is NEW!!! I have heard great things about this book but a USED book is almost worthless. At least half of it's value is in the on-line test you can take to determine your areas of strength. To access the test you need a code which is on the inside of the book (usually the book COVER). The code can only be used ONCE and then becomes inactive. I bought a copy that was supposed to be NEW. When I got it, there was somebody's bookmark in it and when I tried the code, it had already been used. I contacted the seller and they e-mailed me another code to try but that code had also been previously used."
3,DO NOT buy a used version,"This may be one of those uncommon common-sense sorta things, but DO NOT buy a used version of the book, since the code in all probability would have been used/expired already. I was browsing a bookstore and bought a used version on a hunch(not having heard of it before), and when I got to the meat and potatoes, the plate was kinda snatched away. Decent read so far, but thought I'd put this warning out."
3,"Don't buy this book used!! It's a one-time, one-person book!!","Much of the book hinges on the results of an online assessment. The access code to this is included with the book. If someone has already used it, you are out of luck. The only way to get one is to buy a new $18 book. Access codes can only be used once, no exceptions. My initial thought was to go ahead and buy a new one then I could just pass it along to someone else, but then they will be in the same mess. I'll give the first part of the book 5 stars, but very disappointed that I can't enjoy the second half. If anyone has a brilliant solution, please let me know!"
2,Bad Business,"I picked up a copy of this book from my library because it was mentioned inBeyond Talent: Become Someone Who Gets Extraordinary Results. The first third of the book is devoted to hyping and explaining the Strength Finder Test you're supposed to get to take which will help you assess your areas of strength and provide the basis for the rest of the book.Unfortunately, the test is only available on their website and only way to get an access code to take the assessment is by purchasing the book new. Codes are only valid once and cannot be purchased separately. Therefore, you will get very little out of this book unless you own a fresh copy and you cannot borrow or share it with anyone without buying additional brand new copies.I had expected to like this book, but given that the entire thing is based around an assessment I cannot access, I'm extremely disappointed. I will not be buying this book and recommend that you don't either."
3,Don't purchase used,"I purchased this used and discovered about halfway through the book that the reader needs to complete a survey or profile. The code is on the book cover. However, the original ownder of the book used it and there is no alternative but purchasing another new book. Frustrating. I would even purchase a new code, but this is not available."
4,"Very insightful, but a little bit of a let down","We ordered these books for everyone in my department at work. It was very insightful, not to mention interesting, to find out how each of us function. I think it will also be very beneficial in learning to work with each others' strengths. However, I really don't like that they only give you your top 5. There are 34 strengths. We all agreed that it would be better to maybe get your top and bottom 5s, and/or possibly your ranking that you've got on each strength. Overall though, definitely worth the money."
3,Découvrez vos forces le plus tt possible,"Le plus tt, le mieux. Ce livre présente un test qui vous permettra de découvrir quelles sont vos principales forces.Le problème, c'est qu'il ne permet de passer le test qu'une seule fois. Si vous souhaitez qu'un conjoint, un collègue ou un enfant découvre ses forces, vous devrez acheter une autre copie du livre."
3,Interesting but insufficient information,"The main concept of the book, based on lots of research, is that it it a waste of time to work on your weaknesses; instead, focus on your strnegths--if you know them. The test you take on the computer gives you your five strength; however the terminology left me cold and wondering what to do with them and how such strenghs work together in my profession. Most of the web site and the book is aimed at management and HR people and not individuals seeking personal answers. As it goes the book is a decent start but for folks to capitalize on it, they will need another book that is more specific and with more examples than the petty few in this work."
3,left hanging!,"A great start to understand your personality strengths but not enough information on what to do with this evaluation. You can purchase a subscription to a newsletter that discuses topics on this book, but again it is vague on disclosing what you get for your dollars. I guess I'll be left here hanging until a book comes out: ""Now that you have discovered what you really already knew, here is how you can use it."""
1,Very Disappointing,"Based on other reviews I got this book expecting to be informed. What I got was a long poorly disguised sales pitch for their selection test. As a former user of the Gallup test, I should have known better. The basic premise is not new. The things they tout as traits are really just characteristics. I can't believe I paid for a sales pitch."
3,Wish they had more details about your top strengths together,"I was hoping that it's a bit more comprehensive, like the myers briggs, it's fun but doesn't tell you much beyond explaining the individual strengths. you get your top 5 but they don't tell you what that means together, just individually by each strength."
4,Nobody's perfect but resolving problems is a good business practice.,I want to acknowledge Hines Books for going the extra mile to satisfy a problem with my order. No one is perfect and I appreciate that Hines Books responded to my request immediately and resolved the problem to my satisfaction.
1,Beware!!! If you buy this book USED it may be largely useless,"I purchased this book used through Amazon only to discover that for the book to be useful, you have to do an online Strength Finder Profile. The problem is that each book contains a SINGLE code that is only good for ONE USER! So if the original book owner used the code, you won't be able to, and the majority of the book will be meaningless to you because you can't do the profile. I felt completely ripped off when I discovered this! It would be easy for the publisher to note this on the cover so people would know before purchasing, but they don't, so I hold them responsible. They also don't provide or sell additional codes for a fee. I couldn't use the book for its intended purpose therefore it gets only one star."
5,The best book for figuring out your stengths,"This is the best book you want to get in figuring out your strengths, it makes a great gift to your mentees, and a great guide to nurturing your children's strengths. It also shows you how to go forward with your newly found knowledge!"
5,"Highly endorse this ""MUST-READ""!!","As a National Sales Leader . . . I highly endorse this book as a ""Must-Read"" and the Best Gift you can give yourself in terms of Positive Personal Growth and to your Peers in terms of Effectively understanding what makes them ""tick"" and how to Harness each one's strengths, including your own, for a WIN-WIN!!"
4,Now Discover Your Strenghts,"It was rewarding to read a book that helps you focus on strenghts, not weaknesses. It's going to take a while to put in practice what I've learned because it's hard to change thinking patters and habits, but it will help me become a better professional and individual. I highly recommend it."
5,HBO at it's best,"Makes the ""Wild, Wild, Wild West"" look kinda Sissy-fied. Comes complete with those rare moments you would want to repeat at work except that you are smart enough to realize: 1) They probably wouldn't get the reference & 2) You'ld be dragged into Human Resources so fast your head would spin around and you'ld puke green-pea-soup all over your supervisor."
1,This HDMI Switch is useless!,"The first HDMI switch arrived and after viewing a program for 3 to 4 minutes the audio would go mute every 2 minutes however the picture always remained on. I sent a complaint and the supplier sent a replacement and it arrived yesterday and after it was installed the audio went mute after 2 minutes and never returned. This item is not perfected and if it were would be a nice addition to my system. It is small the switching was no problem it also has an 5V electric option which they do not tell you in the ad but it switched fine without the power and I tried both. I even changed all the HDMI cables thinking the problem was a faulty cable. Nope, this is a piece of junk and I do not suggest ordering one. The review above that raved is probably the only guy the received the one good unit out of maybe 1000. I requested a refund tired of playing this game."
1,Worthless Because of Poor Quality Connectors,"I bought this device because I have an older HD television with only one HDMI input. I was hoping to be able to run my satellite dish and upconverting DVD player on the TV. Forget every other feature this device might offer. The connectors are of such low quality that jiggling the HDMI cables will cause the signal to drop in and out. Even without touching anything, the signal will drop out randomly. Every time this happened, I was able to restore the picture by jiggling the HDMI cables. I tried different cables (new and old ones that I knew worked) in different configurations. After an afternoon of frustration, I just pulled the device out. It will be headed for the trash."
5,Rusk Shampoo,"Fast shipping ! This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. I have very thick hair, and have a hard time finding hair products that can tame my hair. The shampoo does a great job ! Leaving my hair soft and smelling great! I also use the Rusk Coral Therapy conditioner as well, and they compliment each other very well. As far as the product detangling I have to give it a A++. Trust me I have tried them all, and usually they leave my hair at best smelling ok, But I still have to spend a while combing through. If you are considering this product please give it a try, I realize it may not work for everyone, but it sure did work for me."
1,Powerless power auger,Be careful ordering this item. You will end up with an auger that has no motor. Does not even come with a handle to crank the piece of crap. Power head is discontinued and yet they are still selling these units. This is nothow you keep me as a customer. Amazon-Sportsman's Guide thanks but no thanks!!
4,Laugh out loud!,"The more I read Wodehouse's Jeeves books, the more I love them. That is some wickedly funny and brilliant writing.All the Jeeves books are told in the first person by a dashing (if bumbling) young Englishman named Bertram Wooster (he occasionally--and pompously--often refers to himself in the first person, so don't be confused at first). Bertie is a bit of a lovable idiot--he messes up EVERYthing he tries to do, and his trusty butler Jeeves quietly swoops in to save the day.Here's the brilliance: It's a first-person novel. Bertie has *NO* idea that he is a fool and that Jeeves is the hero. But the audience is aware of it entirely. You could slice the rich irony with a knife!I've often ""read"" these as audiobooks--they're especially suited for it. Librivox has this and several of the other Jeeves books as free recordings."
5,Snarky fun!,"I love PG Wodehouse. His stories are lightening fast fun. I get woven into the storyline very warmly and snuggly. I want to be a part of the ""family & friends"". I need a Jeeves!!!"
3,Definitely have to be in the mood,"Right Ho, Jeeves . . . . . P G WodehouseThis is one of a number of ""Jeeves"" novels by P G Wodehouse . It epitomizes Wodehouse's unique brand of humor. I think one has to be in the correct mood to truly appreciate the ""Jeeves"" tales. This book was my first exposure to the series and I was expecting something quite different. So my review (3 star) is based on my mood at the time. I think my review of the next ""Jeeves"" novel might be higher, because I'll be in the right mood and judge it strictly on it's merits as that type of book"
3,"Wonderful book, weird edition","I know this is a sign of the times, but just for a heads-up: this edition (ships on cover) is print-on-demand, with an odd oversized format. Also, the format is unpleasant for reading, more like a manuscript than an actual book."
5,Great book,Purchased this book for my older teen son who loves to read - he loved it and could be heard laughing throughout the book. he can't wait to read more of the series.
3,Interesting Objectivist-flavored mystery.,"Has the same feel and flavor as Ayn Rand's ""The Night of January Sixteenth"" stageplay. It also share's Rand's philosophical principles -- which is fine with me. Unfortunately, it also shares Rand's humorlessness, and isn't really in the same league, as far as plot goes. Still, it's a decent effort, and it's refreshing to see some unapologetic moral certainty. If you haven't read Rand's books, this review won't mean much to you -- and in that case, I suggest you read some of her novels first (they're all great.) If you like Rand, then come back and look at Mr. Cline's book ... without that introduction, I suspect you'll find his detective's motivations inexplicable."
5,Yikes...,"This book was horribly hard to rip away from. Not for the weak minded. It is reminicent of Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury,"" although much easier to read and get into! It was absolutely amazing."
4,Sleeping Dogs,"What a fantastic book! It really pushes the boundaries of teenage fiction, its so crafted and mature. I loved the sense of futility that overshadowed the whole novel, and the atmosphere of impending doom. You could really feel the frustration of the characters as they buckled helplessly against the pointlessness of their existence. I felt completely shattered after finishing it. I'm so glad that some American readers have discovered this wonderful Australian author - she deserves so much more recognition than she gets."
4,I have never read a book so fast!,"When I was starkly reminded on Friday at school that I still hadn't read and reviewed my journal novel which we had, had the past 2 months to do. I had some work to do over the weekend! So, I sat down on Saturday morning with Sleeping Dogs and two hours later realised that I had finished this enthralling story. I was so encaptured by the book, I didn't even think of putting it down and now because of my English assignment and one amazing book I can say I read a book in two hours! Wow!"
1,And I'm being generous,"The first two stories were horrendous and anyone who says something else is lying to you. The last story was okay... I held my attention. However, it just ended. There was no real controversy then all of a sudden you turn the page and they were married. Can I get an insecure moment? Can I get a misunderstanding? Can I get something? The second story... forbidden fantasy... yeah I'm thinking homeboy was a pedophile. And both of them (Austin and Ashleigh) worked my nerves. How about you both invest in a therapist then try to get in a relationship. It was melodramatic and anticlimactic. And as far as loves masquerade goes, five words for you: give me my money back!Peace"
4,A perfect read,"I read this book soon after finishing my finals as well as a 700 page turner. This short novel was a great read and is exactly how a book should be. The books purpose is to tell the stories of several different people through the eyes of a slightly obsessive and very eccentric teenage girl. The one thing I enjoyed about this read was that it is unlike most teenage novels out there. The young girl isn't faced with the typical high school problems and the problems she does have she goes about them in a very relaxed way, There is nothing annoying or wrong about this book, and I say ""well done"" Patty Dann."
1,"lazy, cheap production","Computer generated sound track, sounds like it is being narrated by Steven Hawkings.Poor resolution on graphics, it looks like someone ""live animated"" a textbook. Boring, overly technical, painful to watch. (I am an ASE master mech.)I bought the OBD 2 diagnostic, a complete waste of money."
2,Pretty hard to watch.,The accent of the narrator was annoying as well as his use of the same phrases repeatedly. It took so long to cover the subject that it was difficult to sit through and watch it all. It could have been presented in less than half the time and be effective.
3,Basic Information for Electricity and Electrical Diagnosis,"The video is a decent source of information. The narrator's accent and the fact that he talks slowly makes the video drag on, I ended up having to skip through parts of the video. One annoying thing (why I rated it lower) is because it sounds like he is reading from a script, and he continuously says, ""actually"", it got annoying and hard to pay attention to after the 15th time. So, if you haven't had any previous education on automotive electrical theory, this may be a good video for you to watch (if you don't like to read)."
4,Where is the sequel?,"I can't remember where I picked up this book but I do recall being excited that it was by a local artist (Somerville, MA). I loved the characters who felt like people I could easily meet and become friends with. The dialogue is spot on. At the end I was really looking forward to the planned sequel. Sadly, that was 6 or 7 years ago and I haven't heard anything about it since."
3,Sheet Music,"Where can I get sheet music for this musical? I want our choir to do a production for this musical. I have been searching far and wide with not much luck, and my time is running out in starting this production. a venue and date is already allocated.Jr. Thomas"
3,A good fantasy novel for young readers.,"Patrick has found himself on the other side of the Barrier. After testing a computer in a shop ,Patrick's life has changed .He is now playing Finders Keepers ! Patrick has to find other peoples treasure and then return it to them.If he is succsessful Boopie Cupid spins a prize wheel, what ever number it lands on Patrick gets that prize.I thought the book Finders keepers was interesting to read.Alexandra Karacsay"
4,This book was interesting until the end.,This story is about aboy named Patrick.Who is in love with computers.He got on anothercomputer and typed his way into being on the show Finders Keepers. He goes over the Barrier to be on the exciting show Finders Keepers.One day he nearly gets caught over on the other side of the Barrier.He eventually comes back over. His babysiter is reunited with her sister..The next time he comes home he finds hes now got his own EasyWay computer.Devon Eddy.
2,"A GREAT studio band, but.........","I have to agree with the reviewer from California who gave this disc one star. I LOVE Be Bop Deluxe, even saw them live on the Drastic Plastic tour (great show!!). But their music, performed live, just sounds ""flat"" when transferred to tape/disc. I had the ""Live in the Air Age"" album when it first came out (white vinyl, too!!) and it left me cold. I hardly ever listened to it. I've picked up all of the live BBD stuff since then and it doesn't do it for me. It just loses something without that bit of studio flavoring and sweetening that makes their albums such a joy to listen to."
1,Correction to Previous Review,I meant....even he couldn't make their concerts sound anywhere near as good as their STUDIO albums.Sorry.
1,Don't bother,"I love BBD but the fact is that they never were a very good live band. Bill Nelson was the only great musician in the group and without the benefit of studio production and multi-tracking, even he couldn't make their concerts sound anywhere near as good as their live albums.This band is actually LESS dynamic live than in the studio.In addition, many of these songs suffer from inferior mixes.Get Sunburst Finish or Axe Victim instead."
5,BR5-49,"This is their 2nd CD and has some really great tunes. I love the way they mix country, blues, and comedy with their songs. It includes the hit ""Cherokee Boogie""."
5,This is one of the best...,This has got to be one of the best honky-tonk recordings of all time! Please see this band live!!!
5,Mariner Compass Quilts - Setting,It's a wonderful book to have in your library . It is simply explained beautiful pattern to choose from. A must have for me.
5,"Mariner's Compass Quilts-Setting a New C: New Process, New Patterns...",The book was a hit. Many hours were spent perusing the Christmas gift. Now home and setting up her quilting to perfect the newly learned skills in the book.
5,Mariner's Compass Quilts: Setting A New Course,The book is great. I can follow the directions and it is great on pictures and hints to make the quilts as they shoud be. The patterns are great and I am learning a lot
5,Best Quilting Book I Own,"I have wanted to make Mariner's Compass and New York Beauty blocks but, although an experienced quilter, I felt that these would be far too difficult. Judy Mathieson's book changed my mindset! With the aid of this wonderful detailed book I now have the confidence to tackle both these blocks and be assured of success."
5,GREAT LIGHT READING!,"This was my first Christina Skye book, but it won't be my last! It was fast-paced, and engaging in that way where you can read it even if you're not in the mood to read. It was delightfully sensual, and had a lot of romantic build-up. The plot was kind of silly, but that's what was so great about it. It was the kind of plot you don't have to think about - you can just enjoy. It had a great villain, that you really loved to hate, and a very happy ending. You definitely get your money's worth with this quick, fun read!"
1,quite simply the worst romance I've ever read,"This book was quite simply the worst romance I've ever read. I am not an especially fast reader but I usually manage to read a good book in one or two days. This book took me an entire week before I finally tossed it aside. The plot was inconsistent and so full of errors I found myself re-reading vast sections of it to make some sense of what was going on. The two main characters seem to repeat the same passionate scene to the point that it became not passionate at all but simply redundant. I bought this book based on the shinning reviews of other readers so I wrote this to warn any future buyers, at least one person thought this was a horrible romance novel."
1,If I could give this a lower rating I would!,"I ordered this diary thinking that it would be similar to other travel journals that I have used.What the publisher failed to mention, is that this is designed for the 8-10 year old age group.So while it would make a nice gift for a young friend, it is useless to an adult.I would suggest anyone looking for a small and handy travel diary, search for the one by Letts of London."
1,nice shirt bad buttons,well at 1st I was floored by this shirt but just after a few weeks the snap buttons started falling off ! The material is well made but what good is that if you cant button it ?
5,Great style!,"What can I say about Wrangler that everyone doesn`t know? Great looking, great fitting, great quality shirt, and my son looks great wearing it!"
3,returned this item,"At first ordered a medium, way too long....ordered this small and was extremely small...returned both shirts. Will wait till we find one in a store before we purchase again."
3,"Great shirt, not for the suburban cowboy.","This is really a fine shirt. The washed fabric's character is immediately soft and heavier than you might expect. Beware the meaning of 'cowboy cut' though. This shirt's 8 inch drop narrow body is perfect for the mounted cowboy roaming the grassland, herding stray heifers and wrestling calves for branding. This shirt is not so good for the suburban cowboy lifestyle of riding the couch and desk, rounding up stray spreadsheets and wrestling calf-skin clad heifers at the local dance club. I returned the shirt, but will consider buying a size up in the future."
5,La Mar & I Like Clown,"Just talked to and old friend from UK telling me that Steffen Aaskoven from Bliss (Quiet Letters, No One Built This Moment etc.) are one of the producers and songwriters on La Mar and I Like Clowns......Have this album since 1999 - can really recommended it!"
2,Sorta boring,"I bought this CD because I'd caught a few of Jose's tunes of the Cafe del Mar series, and thought, nice, maybe I should buy the whole CD. The CD is relazing and the first time I listened to it I really liked it, but somewhere around the second time, it just got boring. It sort of dreamy, repetitive music that just runs out of steam fast. I give this two stars and I'm considering putting this one up for sell."
1,earrings,the metal bar is too short to easily put into ear hole then clamp. the clamp is not tight and often comes loose. you can bend the wire back so the clamp is tighter but then it is hard to unclamp and get out of your ear.not satisfied with these earrings but you get what you pay for.
3,Good,"The watch came with an old battery ,which made it stop after few days,the alarm is not very loud,but it looks well."
5,I luv it I Iuv it I luv it,"This is the best gun ever it fires at 400 fps and shot through a soda can and out the other side THIS GUN IS AWESOME!!!! This gun is very accurate and shoots very very hard. The only thing i don't like is the fact that the trigger is really hard to pull, but you get use to it after like 50 shots. GET THIS GUN"
4,Airsoft TSD co2 m9,"This is a great gun and you will get your money's worth at forty dollars. I recommend using golden ball .20 bb's otherwise the bb will mess up the gun or fall apart and explode out the barrel. If you are looking for a quality non blowback co2 pistol, this is the gun for you. trust me ....it WILL be worth it."
2,Works at first but.,"I got this sometime last year thinking it was decent pricing for such a solid looking gun-I was wrong... When I got it, the canisters were very difficult to put in, and once i did screw them in finally it seemed as if it was leaking a bit. A week after I purchased it the canisters stopped screwing in all together, I took a closer look at it and realized the needle that punctures the canister was made too far away from the area you put the canister in... After an interesting battle with customer service over getting charged multiple times, I was fed up and decided just to put it away and forget the whole mess, until amazon reminded me i still had to review this product..."
1,leaked everywhere,when I first got this gun it seemed great entil i put a co2 carten in it sprayed everywhere. this is my first co2 gun and it keeps on spraying everywhere now it wont even shoot please help!
3,Good book with minor inaccuracies,"This is a good children's book though it has minor inaccuracies. An example is a page highlighting engine dials when they appear to be backup instruments for the artificial horizon, vertical speed indicator, and altimeter. The could have easily said backup gauges or backup flight instruments. Other than a few minor inaccuracies the book is good and bridges some of the little kids' books with the big kids' books."
4,"Rigging Knife, Black","I perchased the knife for my nephew who took it on and extedned sailing trip from Annapolis, MD to St. Marten......8 days at sea. He found it met all his expectations. At under $5.00 it could be an exceptional value if it holds up over time. Only time will tell if it is truley a good knife."
1,A bad LP transfer,"This is a typical ripoff, a recording of an LP-with clicks and pops and everything- to a tape and then to a cd.Save your money on this one.I have other Disky cds and they are fine-this one is just an insult, sorry."
3,Not bad...,"True to the title, the stitches are simple and the designs are OK, but many of the yarns are 'exotic', not easily obtainable. This isn't stuff you can go to [the store] and pick up, in fact, I haven't been able to find it in many of my yarn catalogs, and have been unable to determine the gauge of the yarns they used in the book, so that I could substitute something else."
4,Crocheted Sweaters,"This book has a nice selection of sweaters and they are actually wearable. A nice selection, well written and totally worth the money."
2,Intermediate Crocheter's Review,"This book must be for professional crocheters. The instructions and suggested yarns were beyond my thinking. I keep looking through this book and have come to the conclusion that it is for advanced crocheters only. I was enlightened on how to use beads in crocheting though, so all has not been lost. I will continue to read this book, and continue to crochet, and maybe one day I will be able to use this book.Credit is to be given for the ideas and the pictures."
1,not worth it,There is nothing in this book I would take the time to crochet. The sweaters are sloppy looking and amaturish.
1,Does not work!,I live on the Delmarva peninsula and this product did not touch water spots left by irrigation overspray . . . I would advise looking elsewhere.
1,DOES NOT WORK! DO NOT BUY!,"I tried this and it didn't work at all! I expected more from meguiars! I bought it from them because of there reputation, however don't waist your money."
1,This sucks,Worth less soap and water would do a better job. Do not buy this product. It's waste of time and money.
3,Table For Two,"I love putting this on while working in the office. The music makes me feel that I'm on vacation somewhere instead of at my desk! The CD is full of solid original music that gets me humming the rest of the day. The song ""Angelique"" is a wonderful tune that lets the trumpet speak of love, something not so easy to do. Most of the songs feature the trumpet, and take us to a beach somewhere in the Carribian. The song ""Having Fun"" is just a simple reflection on how important a day together just having fun can be. This music speaks well of love and friendship, pulling you along with a gentle hand to things simple and deep."
5,Lots of information,I found this book very informative. Very good book and captures all the research out there on the internet in an organized reference you can go to at any time. Highly recommended.
5,Great Information!,This book is a great resource for those curious about the process of making flour and nutritional value.
3,"good for a beginner, of limited value for those experienced","Far too much 'preliminary' stuff and not enough recipes. Over half the book describes grains, grinders, stuff like that, which is interesting to a beginner, but of little value to someone who knows something about using fresh-ground grains. It would be nice to find a more advanced version with more creative recipes and ideas."
2,"with or without the wife, it's a disappointing read","I was really happy to find this book because it is sort of a sequal to A Nice Girl... in that Ezra, the hero, it the brother of the heroine there. So I was hoping to see some familiar characters and a similiar sort of mix of passion, wit and intelligence.However this book was actually quite boring. You never really fell in love with Ezra. I can't remember the heroine's name but she had some complicated sub plot which was never resolved. And their relationship was neither passionate nor romantic. I'm a big Sellers fan but this one doesn't work..."
2,Really bad picture quality.,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a cardboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""Hunting Grounds"" (original title: Catch 'Em If You Can) and ""The Legend of the White Lion"" (original title: Journey into Time). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack."
4,Aussie Justice,"Well written and researched. It does not get bogged down in details but you understand everything. The trial moves along. Some authors think they need to put every word of the transcript and redundant lawyerspeak down in book, but thats like sitting in church and staying awake."
2,"Sub-par ""Relaxation"" music. Not recommended.","I'm not sure where I got this album, but it is likely from a clearance bin at the dollar store. The songs are droning and lengthy, and, I suspect, were recorded from a small Casio keyboard in someone's garage. It is professionally produced and the sound quality is just fine, but frankly, the music isn't very good. I found myself thinking more about how amateur and mundane the music was, rather than relaxing. Bottom Line: I recommend you spend your money on something else."
3,Not quite what it is billed as.,"This double album is advertised as a collection of the post-Cronos years. It is actually a haphazard collection of two albums and live versions of older songs. ""The Collection"" is a mid-price comp. of the same period, and has a better track selection. Get that one instead!"
2,Quite Disappointing,"I've liked Venom at least for their At War With Satan album. I like their simplicity and crudeness. Unfortunately, this two CD set contains the most bland and faceless tunes I've ever heard in one place. Nothing against the band but they seriously need a songwriter. I understand this is a collection of this and that and it shows. I've tried to get into the album but after five listens all the way through, I cannot remember a single cut, except for the chorus to the In memory of... whatever. There are not too many albums that can assemble so many songs that are instantly forgettable. This in no way compares to their earlier work.Not recommended. Get one of their earlier albums."
5,A great read for women in all stages of mothering,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was first a gift during my pregnancy given by my daughter's Godmother. A valuable resource, that's pleasant to read and full of wisdom gems, I then shared Buddha Mom with my prenatal yoga students. Many of them commented on the beauty, support and reassurance Jacqueline's words provided."
4,For mothers of all paths...,"I am not buddhist, but this book spoke to me in ways that go beyond spiritual definitions. I was looking for a way to have a more peaceful household, and Ms. Kramer's words gave me inspiration and ideas to change things within myself to create a family life that made my entire family more content. I highly recommend not only her book, but also her website (http://www.buddhamom.com) and email group."
1,"wow, so not what I expected.","After reading the various reviews, I decided to buy this book. However, I was really disappointed as it's less a book about buddhism and motherhood and more a book about the author. There was little content in the book that was either interesting or useful to me on a spiritual level as most of the text focuses on the author's experience. If you are looking for good book on buddhism and parenting, check out Everyday Blessings by Jon and Myla Kabat-Zinn and Buddhism for Mothers by Sarah Napthali."
1,not up to her usual,"Very disappointing. I normally enjoy her books, they usually hold my interest but this one had no meat to it."
4,Always A Good Story,"Nora Roberts, in my opinion, does not know how to write a story that is not appealing on some level. Just when I think I have read everything she has ever written, along comes another one, usually an earlier one being rereleased and it is still good. A talented woman is she. This one is light and enjoyable for teens and adults."
4,It was interesting.,I liked the settings and the characterisation of the Lady. I didnot like the way author has equalled sex with romance. The scenes with the hero and heroine in their normal settings was very interesting.
1,Typical,This is the typical strong woman who cannot think straight when around the good looking man. Determined to not get involved but of course...they do. Would not recommend this book to anyone. I was truly disappointed.
4,"Love the characters, both strong personalities",The Law is a Lady is well written book with believable characters. Would recommend this book to my friends.L
2,The Law is a Lady,"It was a nice love story, but too predictable. I ordered 2 of her other books as well and they all had the same premise. Boy & girl pretend they don't like each other, have sex and decide they are in love. Not much to the story."
2,"""objects in picture appear larger than real life""","I have several pair of Sony MDR headphones that my teenagers tear up. I've replaced two mini plugs already. Not an enjoyable experience. The little weighted gizmo with alligator clips and magnifying lens another reviewer suggested are definitely worth the 6 bucks. This plug is not larger than average. I bought Radio Shack's premium gold plug for less money. It has gold plated connections which take solder well, a large opening at the back of the barrel, and a strain relief coil.Happy soldering to you!"
3,Does what it needs to,"Ok product for fixing 3.5mm plugs. Comes in pieces, which isn't really well depicted. It would also help to sodder to contacts to the wire, just an FYI for planning purposes."
4,Neutrik 3.5mm stereo plug,I'm kind of a fixer and I had some old speakers that came with a Dell desktop. The plug that was factory molded onto the wire somehow had a bad wire inside the molded insulation. I ordered this plug and received it in good condition and on time as always when I order with Amazon.com. I made the repair and I'm now enjoying the speakers that I would have had to discard if not for this plug.
1,Received correct plug but wrong cap,"As usual Amazon Prime did its part by shipping my item in just two days. Great. It came in two parts in a plastic package. The gold plug and the plastic cover. I opened it up and decided to try and screw on the plastic cap on the headphone part and realized it doesn't fit. The cap wouldn't go past the two pointed ends of the metal plug. Also, I have to mention that the cap I received has Yongsheng and its logo on it vice Neutrik like the picture on the ad. I'm guessing Neutrik is part of Yongsheng or something but I still received the wrong cap. However, if you're willing to go through the extra effort to trim off the metal pieces then the cap will fit and screw on."
4,pretty nice 3.5mm plug,"I have purchased this plug to repair my earphone plug (because i use one that costs like 200 dollars+)Overall, i think this is great plug because it's easy to solder, and it also holds cable tight (you have to lock the cable before closing the cover) so I'm now worry-less on the plug partOnly con that I found was that it wears out somewhat quickly and plug itself is heavy and largeStill, best plug for the cost wise, and works perfectly fine and I'm probably gonna buy few more of these forthe futureIf you want 90degree angled plug, one from Neutrik is amazing soo look for that one also!Ps. If you want something that looks better, look for Belkin plugs if you can find it somewhere... or Pilliccs(orwhatsoevercalled)"
2,Big and clunky......,"Thought that this was a nice small replacement plug that would fit through the space in my iPhone case - NOT! Should have returned, but took it apart and too embarrassed..... Pretty though."
5,even sturdier than stock connector,"Very sturdy and easy to solder. Also, the clamp mechanism is very strong which is important when keeping the cord attached through stress. And it's gold plated so this is a no brainer when your cord or plug is done for."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON A MAC,"As other reviewers have stated, it worked once, beeped and then shut off. For some reason, it is not compatible with Macs. I would like to know why, couldn't get a hold of anyone at the manufacturer so I returned it to Amazon."
4,"Good quality, great price","This scanner works as advertised and very consistently. I'm an Amazon Marketplace seller and needed a scanner for bulk listings. Only a few books of mine didn't scan, such as when the paper that an ISBN number is slightly torn. Otherwise, the scanner quickly feeds the number into whatever field you've placed your cursor. You need to hold it close to the item/bar code since it's not a laser scanner. The scanner appears sturdy and ready for countless hours of use. Best of all, it's way cheaper than many similar scanners."
3,"Useless for books, otherwise ok","Bought this to scan my book collection, and it turned out to be 90% useless - it will ONLY scan EAN format book codes, as they have the price in the 5-digit addon which you can safely ignore, while UPC format book codes have the price in the middle, so without the 5-digit addon, you can't find the right book.Will scan other barcodes fine, like movies and video games, but just not books...Will be returning, since I need book scanning; would keep otherwise."
3,Works great when positioned just right,"this thing is a champ. Just plug and play. However, you may want to consider paying a little more for a scanner what does not need to be right on the barcode at just the right angle. I purchased it for inventory control at my coin shop, lowcountrycoins.com. My employees have not complained, but have made a few mistakes because it isn't as user friendly as could be."
3,Not sleek!,"It does what it says it will do, it was easy to just plug in and use, but it's a big old clunky tool, so if you are into aesthetics or design, it is not for you. It appears to be pretty reliable and robust."
3,"Good, but bad customer service.","After plugging in the scanner, it scanned barcodes that the other one I had never did. But I couldn't get it to read regular bacodes. It took me a week of calling and emailing to get any response. I am pleased with the quality and scanning ability, once I got help. I won't order any other products from this company due to the customer service."
5,Delivers what it says,"Nothing more, nothing less. Just plug and play for very adequate for home use. Keep the booklet that comes with it to program the scanner. You can opt to not hear a sound when it scans and more. I scanned in over 200 books into a collection with no problems. The price is right!"
1,"Poor item, poor service.","Absolute junk.Bought one, never worked at all out of the box. Never once transmitted a code.Played with all the settings, etc, etc, no go.Called Adesso. Here's the fun part. They offer a 1-800 number, yet no one answers it or returns messages. If you want service, you have to call the direct phone number. Nice trick.So, they figure it's defective, send me a new one. First, that shipment was slow. Second, despite promising the wouldn't, they charged my card for it.Third, the new unit didn't work either.Now I get to call them, again on my own dime, and try to send 2 of these useless items back.Stay away. Useless item, useless service."
3,Barcode scanner on Mac,"The scanner reads codes correctly and easily. However, every time my Macintosh sees the scanner (either because I plug it in or because I reboot), it thinks it is a new keyboard and tells me to press the key next to the left shift button. It obviously has no such key.I don't know how to eliminate this irritating window."
1,Does not fit my needs,"This is NOT a Laser bar code reader. Beam is very wide and thick, not good for tight close bar codes like serial numbers on equipment"
2,The Bar Code Scanner That Wasn't,"I purchased this bar code scanner to organize a large DVD colection. Thinking it would input the Title and any other information contained in the bar code, it only recorded the numbers that are beneith the code. That does me no good. I contacted the manufacturer, telling them what I wanted to do, and was told I would need a second party software. When I again asked what type of software they could recomend, they didn't have any suggestions. I can away with the feeling; ""You bought it, now deal with it"". I didn't even try to call the toll free number after reading other reviews saying thay could not get any answer on the phone.Shipped it back to Amazon, and was refunded the full price without a hitch. I'll keep looking for a scanner that does what I want it to."
3,Dana goes hardcore,"This german maxi single comes from the post ""Eurovision win"" period. Originally the song has been written and performed by Stevie Wonder. I don't have to add that Dana's version is quite distant from its predecessor...Track list:- single version - basic and in my opinion the best available here- alternative version - which could be also called ""dub"" as there is almost no text in it, but...it defends itself, it's a very good mix- c&n; remix - here we go: hardcore phase 1. Very strong beat (you can be sure your neighbours will here it!) and darker feeling. Well, could be worse, couldn't be?- dj orson w. remix - yeah, it gets worse - check hardcore phase 2. My personal name for this remix? ""Sudden death on a dancefloor"". THE WORST TRACK HERE.Rare item, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who seek for another ""Diva""-kind-of hit."
5,Fantastic,"I was traveling through Morocco and Spain in 2006 when I came across Sylvia in the Spanish town of Tarifa, where e she performed at a small cafe. Her music is wonderful to the ear and she really glows with life."
3,"There is good info here, but buy her other book.","This book is the exact same as the first half of Annabel's other book Portrait and Wedding photography. That book is hardcover, (this one is not), it's much cheaper here on amazon and it also covers wedding photography as well. It is like two books in one. I think it's fair to argue that Annabel gives many tips in the wedding section that would be helpful to a portrait photographer who has no intention of covering weddings.Otherwise this is a good book. Lots of helpful tips, but not overly technical. For those who like the technicalities, each image presented in the book is captioned with the technical details of the image (Camera, film type, lens, shutter speed & aperature).Even so, it is a better deal to buy the hardcover combo portrait & weddings book by Annabel."
2,Not Bad....butlacks details,"I agree with the other reviewers. There are good pictures in it, but the text is not very interesting. For example, some chapters describe an event with the time next to it. That is not important if all you are interested in is what to put in the picture. The pose, the light, the background, the look, the film, the camera are all important aspects in portraiture but it does not play a major role in the book."
1,Upset I had to pay return shipping,"It is upsetting that amazon even offers this book. There is no substance here. The book lacks details, and that is what is required when needing to know how to do professional portraiture. I returned it immediately."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was a disappointment. I feel as though I could have written this book myself. Trust me - that's not saying much. There were a few good pictures in the book, but for the most part I found the remainder to be noncaptivating. I disagree with the individual who stated that this book is, ""dripping with style."" If you consider ""style"" to be a family portrait posed in front of a rusted out building with pieces of scrap metal and pipe laying around, this book is for you!!! I'm all for ""rustic,"" but this just looked like trash!"
5,A teenage rock anthem,"Self is one of my favorite bands, and they (well he) hails from my hometown of Kingsport, TN, which is why I bought the album in the first place. I instantly fell in love with it. It's a definite must have for all. Every song grabs your attention and will not let it go. This album is a redemption for all of you left out to dry after the death of the infamous Alternative explosion (psst...you can stop listening to Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins now) However, the not-yet-released album sounds like it might even be better. If you want to hear how Self sounds now, then check out their song on the Deadman on Campus soundtrack. But if you want my advice...BUY THIS ALBUM NOW...you can thank me later."
2,Just Plain Average,"After hearing such amazing work on Gizmodgery, I went out to get Self's other albums, and nabbed myself this one. You can hear the beginnings of what makes Gizmodgery such a great album, but none of the songs are satisfying. The chord progressions dont work to build up energy or break into new beats or anything.. they're just more strung-together, seemingly without much thought. I didnt add a single song from it to my mp3 mix. This is their first album, and they've clearly grown a lot since, so I would skip this one and get Gizmodgery."
3,what?!? no way is this a 5-star album,"i had this review completely written when my power went out a few hours ago. and you know how frustrating it is to try to write something over by memory, so i won't. basically, i was disappointed by this album because i love self and was expecting their debut to sound really fresh and exciting and creative, but it's frankly not as good as their ""breakthrough"" album--if it can be called such--breakfast with girls. and of course, nothing tops their recorded-using-only-toy-instruments off-the-wall masterpiece gizmodgery, which everyone in the world should own (i recently sold my copy for 27 bucks at half.com...it's out of print, and i'm counting on it being rereleased relatively soon). anyway, subliminal plastic motives sounds like a fifth album, tired, uninspired, and while self had definitely already established the roots of their unique electropop sound, it wouldn't achieve ultimate fruition until the 2nd or 3rd album."
5,This dragon deserves more than 5 stars!!!,"This is the most beautiful dragon sculpture I have seen in a long time and it's a TOY! This is by far my son's favorite dragon toy. The detail on this dragon is unbelievable, especially on the heads. For dragon lover's, this is a MUST buy."
3,ok but,"suppose for the money its okthe tremolo bar does NOTHINGits not attached to springs in the body at allit just screws into pot metal and swivels up an downnottajust crapthe amp is okand like I said, it was cheapnot bitching but if you include the bar it should work, otherwise leave it off!"
2,came with a scratch!,"Really Upset!!! Just recieved this guitar today, but it didn't make me happy.After waiting a week for the guitar to be delivered, I was super excited to open the package. After I opened it, i saw a scratch down the middle of the white part of the guitar (i don't know what it's called, bought this guitar as a beginner). Also the guitar strap smells really bad, maybe from packaging. Anyways, I say don't buy THIS guitar. I don't know maybe it was just my luck, but if i were you i wouldn't take the risk."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,THIS IS THE WORST EVER I AM JUST LEARNING HOW TO PLAY AND AFTER THE SECOND DAY THE CABLE TO THE AMP STARTED TO MESS UP (I AM TELLING EVERYONE IN THE WORLD NOT TO BUY THIS JUNK.)
1,SS10 Guitar review,I didn't want to rate this item because I never got to try it out but the system forced me to choose a star in order to write this review. Guitar shipped from American Musical Store and wasn't packaged properly. Was shipped right off the shelf with no extra packaging for protection therefore when it arrived the guitar was damaged. Had to go thru American Musical to get a return shipping label as Amazon doesn't handle returns on things they don't ship directly. The guitar/amp/accessories where at great deal but unfortunately not great enough for me to keep damaged goods.
5,WOW!,"This packege is one of the best if not the best for the money. The guitar and amp work better than I imagened they would. Some reviews talk about the cord causing inferior sound, this has not been the case for me. It works perfectly. At $115.00 Delivered it can't be beat. Thanks Amazon!!!"
2,Is there a warranty on the amp?,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my son. He used it for about a month before he realized that there is a short in the cord for the amp. The amp is not blown, it is just a problem with the cord. I expected the amp to last longer than a month. I would have returned it sooner, but my son did not tell me that it was not working (typical 20 year old) until after the return date was past. I have read that there is a limited warranty on the guitar, but I can't find anything about a warranty on the amp. Is there anything I can do, short of paying more money to get the amp repaired? I am really dis-pleased that my first Amazon order ever only lasted a little over a month. My son loves the gutiar, I can't pry it out of his hands."
1,It cant be worse,The Amp doesnt work at all. The guitar's workmanship just match its price. If u r looking for a good guitar which is absolute not this one u can close this window.
5,Nice beginner kit,"Bought this kit for my nephew who wanted to learn to play, the guitar is very solid, the acessories were ok but as some others have noted the included tuner leaves a lot to be desired, luckily I had already bought a snark SN-1 tuner to go with this kit (if you need a tuner search Amazon for ""Snark"" they are affordable, 10-15 bucks depending on model, and extremely reliable) the bag, strap, amp excetra were solid no frills good for beginners tools of the trade."
3,"for the price, you can't really go wrong",nothing to complain about for the price but you get what you pay for... a 10 watt amp and a basic electric guitar - perfect for a beginner who just wants to goof around.
1,"GOOD LOOKING, CRAP SOUNDING!","The guitar is good looking, but as said in other reviews, the 6th string hits the fret board. no matter if you use the picks or your finger. it hits the fret all the way to the 4th fret before it stops vibrating on the frets. the other strings seem to do fine, but even that one string hitting the fret, it ruins trying to play it. The amp cord is pretty cheap, but its what you can expect for $119.00. The amp is pretty loud, and has a good amount of adjustments for various sounds. Even tightening the hell out of the 6th string will not prevent it from vibrating on the frets. a good looking guitar is pretty worthless if it does not play worth a damn.You would think that a guitar company that has been in business this long could manufacture a decent sounding guitar, but I guess it's since on the guitar it says ""MADE IN CHINA"" on the back."
5,Great guitar,This guitar is Great. I love playing it. It has a wonderful sound. And the accessories it comes with are good for anyone who is just starting out.
5,what a find!,I bought this cd on faith since I only knew one of the songs listed. I'm so glad that I did! Zucchero blends an intense and passionate voice with unusual but compelling lyrics. Give it a try. And don't underestimate the power of this cd for romantic mood-setting. Wow!
3,No Color,The books are in wonderful condition but I was disappointed to see that the illustrations are in black and white.
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this DVD set with high expectations. It was NOT what I expected. There were no fighting scenes or action scenes with Chise as the ""Ultimate Weapon"". She would appear as the ultimate weapon but there was no violence, fighting, or graphic context. The story was boring and the animation was poor in comparison to other animes Ive seen. I give it 2 out of 5 stars. Did not like this anime At ALL!!!"
1,Geri Halliwell,"the only thing worth listening to on the cd is the great dance track ""its raining men"". everything else is pitiful, horrible. the production is garbage, it sounds like geri is trapped in an Austin Powers movie with NO WAY OUT. her first cd was much better. better to buy the single than waste your money."
4,"Kinda sexy, kinda cheesy, but a whole lotta fun","Geri Halliwell's 2nd solo album after her break-up from the Spice Girls is a feisty, fun, and effortless listen. She doesn't have a great voice - more a low pitched growl than anything - but once she gets revved up on tracks like ""Scream If you Wanna Go Faster"", ""Feels Like Sex"", ""Shake Your Booty Cutie"", ""It's Raining Men"" and ""Heaven and Hell (Being Geri Halliwell)"" it does what it needs to do. A few of her mid-tempo ballads are nice as far as easy-listening is concerned, but it's the dance tunes that work best.Perhaps the best thing about Geri is the fun she seems to be having. Even if some of her lyrics are flat-out cheesy, you know it's all tongue-and-cheek. If anything, this album will bring a smile to your face for the hour or so that it takes to listen to it."
1,Can it get worse?,"For someone who left the Spice Girls, she sure can't let go of the past! Seems like she's trapped in it, as almost every song sounds like a Spiceworld reject. Ms. Halliwell's attempt at altering her musical pallet is laughable - the rocky and funky beats are as out of place as a goth kid in Disney Land.Nothing on this cheese packed excuse for a CD can redeem Ms. Halliwell. The only thing it brings into light is her total lack of any vocal talent, and not the mention song writing ability. If this CD got any cheesier, you'd find in between the Havarti and Chedder in your local Deli. Geez."
4,She's not Ginger Spice any more,"Instead she's some kind of strange blend of American TV star and srpport act for the CARRY ON comedies. ""It'a Raining Men"" was never the world's most difficult song but it does call for a singer with a powerful voice like the original duo who sang it, the Weather Girls. Why give this to Geri to carry? Surely something more suitable could ave been found, like Lee Hazelwood's ""Some Velvet Morning,"" a tune written in such a tiny range that even Kate Moss does a reputable job with it in a duet with Primal Scream on their DIRTY HITS LP.Still it's a rousing album with plenty of assured vocals from Ms. Halliwell. I think she's finally found her groove, but her weight loss and gain will keep her from finding an identity in the US because no way, no how will she ever again look like the skinny rake she plays on the cover."
4,Scream is an understatement,"After purchasing Schizophonic on Amazon I decided to give Scream a try. It took awhile for the album to wear on me. But it is an album I still listen to. Sometimes after a long day I'll play it and it always gets to me. Especially ""Circles Round the Moon"". One of the prettiest love songs I've heard in a long while. It is more of a playful pretty love song. But it is my fave. ""Don't Call Me Baby"" reminds me of the song ""Stop"" by the Spice Girls. Proabably the same writers. I was amazed that Dave from the Eurythmics worked on this album, as did the man who engineered a lot of the Eurythmics' albums. I always liked the New Radicals and I like his rock contribution to the album. For some reason the song and video for Scream IYWGF always reminds me of that Garbage song ""Special."" Overall a good album although I didn't purchase it for the #1 remake of Its raining Men. I loved this era of Geri when she got fit and into athletics and rock."
5,LOVE IT,This cd is so good....I love her energy and spirit and just everything it is way worth the money order it now it is her best cd yet much better than her first one.
5,lack of spice is everything nice,"I waited for two years and too many days to count, but I got a copy of this wonderful cd and it was infectious,I have not stoped playing it, every number is a smash with me,tell me why she was a spice girl agian, If you liked the 1st one, you'll love this,SO BUY IT TODAY,DON'T DELAY"
2,Betty Crocker Angel Food Cake Mixes,I was disappointed in the packing of this product. The product came in a case of 12. I planned to share them with two other people. Six of the boxes has small tears in the same location and could not be used. I gave the other six to my friends and did not keep any for myself.We all know the product is good because this cake is a traditional birthday cake for their family. We were so excited to find them on Amazon since they are no longer carried in our local grocery stores.
3,Shampoo... (?!),"I was so excited to have found the Confetti Angel Food Cake Mix here at Amazon as they don't sell it in the stores here --Until I discovered that included in the list of ingredients is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (just like in most shampoo)! I guess it's the 'fluffing agent.' On the plain white Angel Food Cake Mix, they call it 'Sodium Lauryl Flavor.' If you aren't familiar with this additive, you might want to Google 'Sodium Lauryl Sulfate' before deciding if you would really want to eat this or not..."
4,"Excellent for Relaxing, Working, Playing or Praying!","This cd has so many great songs on it. Fast, Slow, Recent, Old, they all speak to the heart. The best thing about this album is that there are various artists, so you won't hear the same sound the entire time!"
3,"Worth having, but not from THIS ""vendor""","These four films are, to any Stones' fan, indespensible. But it's pretty common knowledge that they're available elsewhere (a LOT of ""elsewheres"")for about one-third the price listed for this...""compilation."" You're just paying for the packaging here. And whoever designed the ""packaging"" seems to've spent a lot of time with certain...""Aerosmith artwork."""
4,"Not what I was expecting, but enjoyable","This is your typical Lucille Ball. She is a terrific actress and comedianne. I agree with other reviewers, put this on DVD! The movie is a bit slow at first, but gets better and better as it progresses. My favorite part is when they are on the ship with the diamonds, except for the banana spiders... You will not be disappointed with this one if you love Lucy. It's just another testament to Lucy's prowess to dominate the comedy world."
2,dont get this game,"it is a horrible game. you get a puppy, bring it home and all that stuff but it gets very boring in a hurry. this game was the worst game i bought with my own money. dont get this game. it is fun for a week and then it very boring."
5,FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!!!!!,"This is probably one of the funnest games of 2005.First of all, who dosn't want a puppy who never grows up, and never dies? I don't have a dog, so this game is perfect.The dogs are all cute, epecially the shetland sheepdog, shiba inu, and golden retriever, and don't make a huge mess. Using the built in microphone, you can teach it tricks, and blow bubbles for it. Anyone who dosn't like this game is SO LAME!"
5,nintendogs,I love this game. I told my kids if they can take care of these dogs then maybe we can get a real one. I love this game.
4,fun game with some minor bad spots,"This is a review coming from a kid. This game has some nice detialed graphics but some areas seamed rushed. You first buy your puppy from the kennel. Then you teach its name with the microphone. Then you can play with your puppy and teach it tricks. You take your dog on walks and compete it in competitions for money to bye more dogs. It lasts forever and is very fun. The sound is great. The barks sound real and the music is nice and catchy. Every thing acts real. The reason why this 4 stars is you can only walk your dog every 30 minutes, you can only enter 3 contests a day and can only teach 3-4 tricks a day. Overall this is a great game and any dog lover will like it."
1,Waste of time...,This is the biggest waste of time impulse purchase I have seen in a while. It's so sad that people have time to waste on a fake puppy when there are thousands of animals in shelters all around the US looking for a loving home.
1,my 7 yr old daughter found this very boring...,"I am sorry to say, we had great expectations for this game, as we are chihuahua owners and thought it would be really cute. My daughter, 7, was very disappointed. She dosen't play the game at all. She says the game only lets her teach the dog her name, and that is it. For us, it was a complete waste of cash."
4,Very fun,"I like this game. It is cute and fun. It is very realistic, so I think it's a great idea for people or kids who want a pet but can't have one.The sounds and commands are so realistic my chihuahua at home gets jealous when I play, and walks in front of it!"
5,"Entertaining, yet teaches real life responsibility","I got this item for my 7 year old grandaughter. She loves her new puppydogs. She learned the responsibility of the everyday needs of a puppy, and also learned alittle about budgeting her expenses when making purchases for the daily needs of her pups. She has so much fun when entering them into competitions,and shows pride in their acheivements. I would buy it again! Thanks for making this available so reasonable priced."
4,Fun Game,"This game is amazingly cute, and suprisingly realistic. You have to feed, bathe, train, walk, and socialize with your dog. You can enter it in competitions with earn you money and helps make the game more interesting. It's super cute."
5,ur not cool!,"i am writing to the kid who thinks he/she is soooo cool because they said mention me in your review and call me cool! well i am calling you stupid because you must be so little that you cant even spell the word waste right. but whatever, i am not calling you cool because you are a dork and your review didnt help me even though this one i am writing doesnt help either! but who cares! you are a dork kid!"
1,OMG!!!! Totally irritating game!,Don't bother with this one unless you like repeting yourself over and over and over and over.....................................
2,Don't listen to anyone else! Listen to me!,"Ok, there are a few things good with this game...There are dogs in it...there are lots of bad things, The game gets boring after a day or two, its the same thing every day...turn on the game, feed them, clean them, take them for a walk, pet them, play with them, and maybe get a new dog or enter a contest. It is really boring, oh yea, the dogs have voice recognition, but only for a certain voice, so if your buddy comes over and buys a new dog, you're gonna have to match his voice if you want the dog's attention. Don't waste your money. If you are gonna buy a DS, buy the weird minigame ones or the puzzle ones like Warioware, or Feel the Magic XX XY. Or Mario Kart DS...(its online) don't buy this game...You will not be satisfied."
1,Boring!!!,"Why the heck would you buy a game about training a dog?? I think the guy who said it was lame is totally right. Woops, the dogs bowl is empty, I gotta go feed him, what fun!! You gotta have something better to do then to play a game like this. I don't see any fun in controlling a dogs life in a video game. In real life, yea a dog would be great. But in a video game?? A video game???? About raising a dog?? Can somebody please tell me what is so fun about this game?? Seriously."
1,wow,We spend all our time on fake virtual dogs so much that all REAL dogs out there wil probably die of being neglected.
5,[...],"[...]I have owned my japanese import version of this game since first week of June, and even without the english, I can play it and it's probably the best portable game I've ever played, possibly the best computer/video game I've played, with the exception of starcraft.More importantly, I use it as an aid to make kids stop crying at the hospital, and let me tell you, this game stops kids COLD, when they see it at work. The first time you see a 14 month old kid start petting the dog through the window, it's pretty amazing... Same with the bubble blowing."
3,Chihahua Nintendogs,"Cute dogs, although too often they do not respond to their name while training them. My 8 year old got a little discouraged while training his dogs. Not as simple as it seems."
4,A fun interaction,Both of my daughters own this game and enjoy playing it. They especially like being able to take their dogs for walks and to bathe them. I have played it from time to time and I even find it a relaxing game with reasonable challenge to play. Good for all ages.
4,THE BEST GAME EVER,"I did not know what to think of this game . I thought it was thoes normal cool games . When i turned it on I knew it was going to be the best game ever . I loved it so much It ROCKS!!!. I still love it over every game . I think every person who can't have dogs should get this game . I got it in 2004 Now it is 2006 . And it still has won my heart . Who ever thought of this ...THANKS YOUR THE BEST GAME MAKER EVER !!!!!!!!.Maybe there is away to make your own breed that would be cool . The only flae is there should be more breeds . I goten every breed avalibal and the highest money rate . Well, the point is this is a grate game"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The second part of the story begun in Destination Moon. They manage to land safely, but find out they have stowaways, the Thompson Twins! While this is handy for getting work down, it will leave them with severe oxygen problems for the trip back to earth.Even worse, there are some enemy types there as well, which makes the problem even worse, both setting up their observatory, and getting back with enough air to breathe."
4,Helpful,Due to ongoing back problems I often require something strong. This product is quite helpful but the scent is very strong.
2,"Three tracks were bad. I wanted to send it back for a replcement, but I had been too busy.I need replacement.","Some of the tracks were bad. I wanted to send it back to you for a replacement, but I had been very busy. Is there a possibility that I can get a better one?"
5,Memories of the 70's,"Hero & Heroine it is an outstanding ""progressive rock"" album. of a group of talented artists in an environment of inspiration and team work effort. Original 1974 ""Vinyl"" released version shows Rick Wakeman's name on band formation credit chart.Famous musician ""master of the keyboards"" was very succesfull on his participation, just before joining The Yes. The album is a good combination of experimentation, mysterious lyrics and peculiar themes. It is an important register of a music style, time and a collector's obligatory ALBUM, now released on CD."
4,A greta clasic CD.,"I listened to a lot of Strawbs, in high school. This is also iswhere Rick Wakeman (currently on and off keyboard player with the group YES)played on the first two of these albums and later recruited to YES. But at that time I was buying everything connected to YES. Charles Cronk (bass,and vocals) does most of the writing,co-founder,belts out some of the classic Strawbs tunes,like""lay a little light on me"". This is one of those CD just to add to your classic 70's collection. It has that ""70's"" conceptfeel."
5,Paul Trembley,"The first time I heard this album, I thought it to be very wellmade, and it was pretty much a good album. Little did I realizethat it was the Strawbs' best album, and that I'd come acrossa classic. I had remember them from my college days, but wasn'tfamiliar with their music. That all changed after picking thisup and placing it in my collection. Even with all their otherpieces, I still go back to ""Hero and Heroine"" as one of my alltime favorites."
4,Strawbs' finest work.,"Where the Strawbs made a number of fine albums, and a few stinkers, this was their masterpiece. Hero and Heroine presents a seamless flow of musical ideas and prose that culminate in a rather beautiful masterwork. Where there were perhaps more skilled musicians in the progressive-rock family these gentlemen are more than competent and creative artists. This disc, Bursting at the Seams and Ghosts, remain the three ""must buy"" discs presently available. When A&M gets round to releasing No Madness that too is worth purchasing. Sadly, like many prog-rock bands the Strawbs succumbed to the demands of the music industry and bought a sad, slow painful demise for themselves. Well recommended."
3,Lay A Little Remastering On Me,"Oh, the dilemma! Fresh master tapes on scratchy vinyl, or old worn out masters on a clean CD? Strawbs best work is a disappointment on this so called digitally remastered version. Couldn't they find cleaner first generation tapes or use a higher bit converter? Also, the booklet is all commentary but no pics or lyrics. Anyway, Strawbs hit the nail when they went as prog as they were gonna get with this one and the same personnel line-up ""Ghosts"". Genesis meets Moody Blues! David Cousins's vocals may be an aquired taste for some but John Hawken's keys are exquisite, and ""Round And Round"" is flat out exhilarating! Shine on silver sun, indeed!"
4,Good sunglasses,"These are pretty good sunglasses. I've been wearing them now for a couple months and they seem durable. I have noticed the hinges become a little squeeky after awhile, but that's nothing I can't live with. The lenses are clear and crisp and the style is very nice."
4,Hes best,No doubt this is hes best piece of work to date. The opening track with Toi is a classic and as usual Toi is the perfect chick for this song. Her voice is so beautiful and she holds it all together. Without her the song would be nothing as Dr.Dres production is his become trade mark of very simple un-deep and un-complicated funk which doesnt lay down the grooves like it did with Snoop back in the early 90s. Somethin to bounce to and Young Locs slow down are the pic tracks for groove. As usual the album is still inconsistant but the lesser tracks on this album are much more enjoyable than on any of hes previous releases.
3,Heading the wrong direction,"Warren G is heading the wrong direction with this release.He started out with a classic album, followed it up with his worst album, then came back with a hot album and now this. This album is WAY too long and gets hard to listen to by the last few tracks. There aren't too many rewards on this album either. ""Ghetto Village"" is an alright track and the single ""Lookin at You"" isn't bad either, but after those two, theres not much else left worth listening to. If you want to hear good west coast G-Funk rap, get ""Regulate...The G Funk Era, not this."
3,"Tight but, ahhh...","Warren G was hot to def during the G Funk Era then he turned into an easy write off rapper. Return of the Regulater, not quite. Warren g still needs some improving before he reaches his platnuim status where he once was. Bottom Line:tight C.D. but nowhere near his potential."
1,Warren G is capable of more,"To keep it real, I bought this album and returned it the same day. Warren G is at his best when puts out mellow, laid back beats and laces them with simple, but catchy rhymes. This album is full of bouncy beats, and the flows don't really ride the beats well. I though reuniting with mista grimm would be a good idea, but it wasn't used right, and George Clinton doesn't belong here. This album was made for a particular west coast type of fan, and not really intended for hip hop fans in general. warrens best was his first, and take a look over your shoulder was tight too, I still don't know why people hated on his second album. That album was tight. His third, I want it all, was okay, but you could notice a bit of a decline, and this one just dropped his status. His next album, the g files:code 213 should get him back on track though, as I heard he is taking it back to his roots. That should drop sometime this summer, 2003."
1,This Ones A Dud,"My Favourite song right at the monemt would have to be ""somthing to bounce to"" this is basically the only good song on Warren G's disappointing release, ghetto village is alright and the intro soundz quite good, but the rest of the album doesn't sound good at all, warren g use to keep it g-funk, now he got dr dre to produce tracks and dre is getting a bit boring producing everyting now.soumthing to bounce to is a work of art and the rest is striaght up wrong."
4,Return of G-Funk? Not quite.,"Yo, first of all, I am one of the biggest Warren G fans out there. I have all of his first three cds, and the only flaw I found was on, ""I Want It All"". There was to many cameos. Once again that is the big problem with 'Return..' I listen to Warren G for his flow. I loved his layed back, mellow voice and the way he uses it to rhyme. That is why I do not like alot of cameos on his cds, I want to hear more of Warren. And this cd lacks what he is famous for, G-FUNK. I only heard 2 songs that had original G-Funk beats. The rest sounded like Dr.Dre beats. I recomend buying this if you like to hear the G-Child. But do not expect another Regulate...G Funk Era, or you will be dissapointed."
4,"great book, but no subway or train maps","I have used these books for London, Paris, and Rome, and I can tell you they are excellent for figuring out what to see, and do. The graphics are outstanding. My one gripe with this particular book, is the total lack of a subway and train map (they call them S-Bahn and U-Bahn) for Munich. The other DK Eyewitness books, for London, Paris , and Rome, all had these maps of public transport. The Munich system is not just 2 intersecting lines, like the Rome system, but quite a bit more extensive.I looked it up on line, and was rather surprised at the size of it, but then again, Munich does have approx 1 million people, so it makes sense. It should obviously be included, and is, in several other travel books for this area."
2,Not Helpful,"We brought this book along with several other books along to Germany. I found this book had a lot of flashy pictures, but not a lot of substance. While it did give information on all of the major tourist attractions, it did not provide guidance as to what was actually worth doing or seeing."
3,Remember it's F/12 and manual focus,The combination of F/12 and long focal length limit it's use to bright light. Remote shutter release and either live view or mirror lockup are a recommended. With that said the optics are great.
1,Baby Journal,"When I received this journal, I was disappointed. I was looking for something more structured. Flipping through the blank pages made me wonder if I would miss writing something important down... something that I would look back and regret not recording."
1,Bowl Cracked,"The bowl was beautiful, but cracked. I paid $15 for shipping (to me and back), so an expensive lesson."
3,"Good, but missing something",This was good book that provides a framework for writing basic research papers. I hope that the next edition will have a section on graph or table presentations.
2,These are NOT the hits.,"Having loved Soul Train for many years I bought this without much thought. Oops, bad mistake because this is decent music but this stuff by the Soul Train Gang is not part of the Soul Train hits we so fondly remember. Yes, as the first reviewer noted, this is pleasant, professional music, but NOT worth a 4 rating."
1,Another Big Disappointment!!,This set was even worse than Remembering Red.... very poor video quality and alot of tape wasted on commercial breaks. There were so many cherished episodes; where did they dig these bombs up? You still need to add 0 stars to the rating choice.
2,Taub is not a teacher,"Taub is a great shooter, but a horrible teacher. I've watched the video twice and can't follow most of what he says. He rambles, and his presentation non-linear."
2,Low Instructional Value,I have to agree with Adam. David Taub is a great shooter but not a great instructor. This video lacks any organized curriculum and is more just David talking and sharing lots of random declarative thoughts. The problem is that he doesn't explain the logic behind the things that he declares. He just expects us to take him at his word.Unfortunately this results in little educational value for this DVD.
4,"Nice watch, great value",Watch arrived within specified delivery time. Looks very nice with a business suit. Classic good looks make it suitable for work but also more formal occasions. Overall quite pleased with value and product.
5,An incomparable book,"Loco is a misnomer. Rather it should be ""The Cowboy Berserker."" Even that is incomplete. Rather I would say it's a classic and worth preserving as are the great classics preserved."
4,Emma's Review on Camp Counselors,"Never Say Good-Bye Is about a Junior Councelor called Jennifer Trowbridge and she has been trying all Summer to fall in love. With failing terriblely she enters the ""Junior Counselor Contest"" where she makes a bet with Andy Brenner one of her close friends, then things start to go wrong for both of them. Now they are at each others throats accusing the other of sabotage. Then Jennifer realizes that she is in love, but she has no idea what to do about it. Never Say Good-Bye is a funny exciting story with promises of love and humor. I give it 4 stars."
5,"Everything You Could Want to Know About Buffalo, NY","I found this book to be extremely interesting. If you are a history buff (novice or expert), this book will give you details to your heart's content. It contains many, many photos and stories of how life really was in Buffalo from the 1800's to the present. If you are not currently a Buffalo native, after reading this book you'll feel like you are! Two thumbs-up!"
4,A Great book about Science,"I found Cutler's book an engaging and accurate read of one of Denmark's most esteemed scientists. As a student of geology, I often seek out such interesting and thought-provoking science books to help fill the gap between chapters in my dry earth history text.Please remove the Creationist propaganda from the top of your review list. This is so damaging for students of science."
5,A Pleasure to Read,"We are privileged to live in a Golden Age of writing about the history of science. Several other reviewers have already sung the praises, aptly, of this book, so I will merely recommend a few other titles. If you enjoy this book, you'll also enjoy: The Ice Finders; The Man Who Discovered Time; Out of the Flames; The Lunar Men; World on Fire."
2,Boring,I bought SHOUT first and then went and got this and boy was it a letdown. Very boring christian pop. Maybe 2 bright spots but this CD never finds it's way into my player as there is so much better christian music out there nowadays. If you are looking for 65 dba when they were in their techno/ dance vein pick up SHOUT or BUBBLE!!!
3,London Symphony and MJ? Sounds weird but it works.,"Hearing the London Symphony do MJ was clever and interesting. I think it added a different feel to his songs. So, if want to here something ""Off the Wall"", then you should check out this CD. You may not like it at first, but it will grow on you."
5,Poetry at its best,If you like poetry you will love this book. The author invites you into his world and he shares it with you. A must have for any poetry lover.
3,Pretty nice,"Yep, even though the picture shows black mats, it's tan. The original size was slightly too big for my compact car, but the rubber material cuts very easily, so it was not a problem resizing them. Had to make some major cuts to the driver's side mat to accommodate the gas pedal though. Again, no big deal. A minor flaw is that there does not appear to be too strong of a grip to these mats. This is fine when it the front ones fit pretty snugly, but the rear ones will probably slide around with all the foot traffic. All in all, still recommend it."
5,Kudos & thanks to VTC for putting together a useful CD.,+ Covers all the basics of MS Project.+ Greg has experience and knowledge on PM and MS-Project.+ Presentation is simple and easy to follow.+ Can pause and replay the movies.+ Feels like a personal tutor is with/for you.- Greg has a heavy Australian accent.- Looks like the CD was recorded at home.- VTC CDs are priced a little too high.- Requires QuickTime to play the movies.
5,great product,i purchase this product after i had my baby. within two weeks i saw a big difference my skin got firmer and less saggy. it have a very cooling sensation. i apply it in the morning and at night and wear a girdle it really helps too.
3,too big,a size large that should really have said extra large. not happy but will share this with bigger family and friends
2,Fundamentally misconceived,"The radio mix and both of Joey Negro's mixes change the melody line on this track to disasterous effect. The album version on ""Our Time Is Coming"" is long and totally to be preferred. I am mad I spent the money on this CD. (I remember remix CD of Runaway back off their prior album-- now that was great...)"
2,Over priced considering low quality,I only used this stylus for maybe two weeks before the rubber tip started peeling off. Flimsy for the price. I was disappointed.
2,BoxWave Slimline Capacitive Stylus for Amazon Kindle Fire - Crimson Red,I loved it when I first got it. Slimness worked well with my arthritic fingers. But then a month later the rubber tip split in half now I can't use it.Could not remember if there was a warranty on it for so many days after buying it.I was thinking about buying another but after reading other post that they had the tip problem I might not if I can find another slim one cheaper.
1,Poor connection with screen,"I bought this for my wife so she could have people sign her invoices on a Kindle Fire. The tip does not make a good connection and often you could not make a selection, or turn a page. I have a Bamboo for my iPad and it works much better."
3,OK....,It's alright. Wish it was pointier. Not sure it's much slimmer than my finger. I wanted to use it mostly for drawing programs but it's pretty jumpy and not very exact.
1,Was not built well..,"I wanted a slim stylus for my tablet and saw this and thought, ""YAY, I HAVE WHAT I WANTED!"". Unfortunately, after less than an hour of use the top of the pen came off and the pen holder hook thing fell out and was very dissatisfied."
2,Tip Came Off,Liked it for a short while; liked that it's long and connects so you can't lose it. What I didn't like was that the tip has already come off and I can no longer use it less than a month after I purchased it.
1,NO,Tip fell apart in less than 2 weeks. I like the thinner barrel and color but that was it. I say do your home work when looking and pay a little more and buy 2 so you have a back up.
2,PCoA,"I have used PCoA on a few occasions and was hoping this book would explain how the method actually works. This was not the case. The book assumes more knowledge on matrix algebra than I have. I read through it but learned very little that I didn't already know, and what I wanted to know wasn't there. The examples are marinally useful."
2,Not as exciting as the others...,"This Christmas DVD did not keep my daughter's attention, like some of the others. She's a Dora fan but I would have to give this one a thumbs down."
3,Not really a Christmas moive,"My son loves watching Dora so I wanted to get him a Dora Christmas movie for him to enjoy over the holidays. However there is only one short Christmas episode, about 15 minutes long, and the rest is just normal Dora episodes. The Dora episodes are fine, I just wouldn't really call this a Christmas film. It has one short Christmas episode."
2,Just okay...,"Well, there were minor smudges on the disk, but the disk was loose in the case when I received this item. So, I was completely happy with this product and it's delivery."
3,Can't tell yet...,"Can't tell yet, because it will be for christmas gift, after that I can rate it..."
5,Bounty Lands - a true bounty,"I first read this book years ago. I have always remembered the things I learned about American History. Why, for instance, the streets in most American cities run north/south, east/west. What a reward was given to veterans of the revolutionary war. It's a wonderful read. Wonderful characters, including the pigs! C"
5,Best book on Warhol,"Great book - I couldn't put it down. Colacello is wise and witty not only about Andy but also about himself, and the effect that the 'Factory' had on people (most tragically, Fred Hughes)."
4,Riviting tale of the weird and wonderful Warhol,"This book tells all: The bohemian life of Andy Warhol and entourage are deliciously dished. It makes one want to visit the old days and the Factory lifestyle of non-stop parties, non-stop sex, non-stop drugs and non-stop whining from Andy. Andy had the world by the balls and knew it"
4,Not what I expected...,"This book was not what I expected. Banathy took the writings of several authors on the subject of systemic change and presented their ideas for readers in order to allow them to determine their own definitions of the various topics. The book seemed to be accompanied by a notebook or activity book, because every now and then a passage would be labeled Activity 1 or some such, and the author would say something like, now write in your notebook what you think the definition of social change would be based on the above writings. It read almost like a course textbook. It was interesting and held a lot of references on the topic. A rich resource for social change theory."
2,not thrilled,These felt like normal dress tights. relatively thin. I'm a waitress 7 days a week and decided to go with the thigh high compression. I knew these weren't going to be that comfortable. I just wish they felt more thicker like my other compression socks. I feel like these are going to tear very easily. I have tights that i paid like a buck for that feel like this.They did ship very fast and I am pleased with the seller. Just not the product.
5,Beauitiful stool,"Incredibly beautiful bar stool. Perfect length for our newly remodeled kitchen. There was a slight problem in the box and not all the parts right, but they worked with us to make it right. Now it's right and we are very very happy with both the customer service and the quality of the product which is very high quality. Thank you!"
3,Cheap wood,"They are very attractive and easy to assemble. The major flaw is the quality of the wood base under the cushion. I noticed the screws were not biting very well while attaching the cushions to the stool base. All four screws have already fallen out of one stool, the one used on a regular basis. The wood appears to be a low quality plywood. My next step would be to use larger screws and hope for the best. After that I think plastic wall anchors may be needed. I would have sent these stools back, but have changed the covers to a fabric instead of the faux leather."
2,Great cleaner but doesn't last long,"I bought this cleaner in November and have used it about a half dozen times. Tonight, the brushes quit spinning without warning. I think this is a problem with this Hoover because I had to return an identical one for the same problem. The manual makes two suggestions to get them to work, neither of which was successful. Too bad. It did a great job cleaning my carpets (when it worked)."
5,Simply Amazing,"I just couldn't put this book down. Approximately half of the book relates his experiences in the Apostolic Christian Church, eventually becoming a minister and eventually leaving, and the other half covers his experiences with a group that forms another church.Tom writes with an amazing amount of depth and packs an amazing amount of detail into 600 pages. This is a must read for those who have an interest in the Apostolic Christian Church or church leadership in general. He is frank and not afraid to outline areas of concern and grief. Highly recommended!!!!"
5,"Candid, Clear, and Supported","As a Pastor's wife of many years, I have seen people struggle with legalism over and over again. Many come to an intellectual freedom but very few will actually come out of religious systems where factors like family, heritage, church membership, and a code of conduct are necessary parts of the ""salvation"" package. I highly recommend this book to all who are in such groups and are questioning. It will provide them with a useful tool for clarifying the issues."
3,Personal Perspective,I found this book of interest because it deals with members of my family and a church that my father never joined.
1,NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS: total body soreness/aches,"I have Chronic fatigue syndrome/ME since many decades with severe episodes of body pain /aches.I decided to take Serrapeptase (3 times a day 2 x 80,000 IU), because it was said to help with inflammation causing the body pains.Well - unfortunately each time I take a dose, my body pains / soreness become a lot stronger for several hours.I have tried it only for 2 days being 6 dosages - with the increased body pains after each dosage. So I had to stop taking it again.I have googled for this type of side effect with Serrapeptase (independent of which brand) and was astonished how many people posted this same side effect.Why is it always sold has having 'virtually no side effects??? Makes me mad!So really do watch any possible side effects..."
1,3rd review - please do not send again,"This product caused me stomach problems and had to send it back. Some people like it, but not for me."
2,Wasn't effective for my issue,"I used this and the high potency formulations in attempts to improve various forms of scar tissue- I have some injury scars as well as acne scars and none of them showed any change over 10+ months of use. A shame, as it seems to work so well for some."
1,Beware of Serrapeptase,"Do not take more 2-3 capusules a day, If you take more than recommended amounts like most there are cases where it did more harm to you, like it did to me. It undid all Hyberbaric oxygen therapy for 30 days for 2 hrs a day. The book The Miracle Enzyme is Serrapeptase by Robert Redfern where he says does no harm is not true that there no side effects."
2,Didn't work for me,This product may work for some but for me created gas and discomfort. I figured I'd post so that the next person buys with caution or forewarning. Not returning it as it was only $11 but I won't be using it myself.
5,great product,I take this and nattokinase for fibroids and psos and it worked better than I could have imagined I have taken so many things over the years and this combo is the only thing that has helped.
1,Raised my blood pressure,"I tried this for foot neuromas. I didn't notice any improvement, but I only took it for about a week. My blood pressure increased from around 117/77 to around 140/95, with no other apparent reason, so I discontinued it."
2,Don't be fooled by 2 day shipping,"I ran out of serrapeptase and ordered this with a 2-day shipping for 10 bucks. I received it a week later (ordered on 07/06 and promised to be delivered by 07/08 but received it on 07/13). Be careful of 2-day shipping with this fella, you might end up wasting 10 dollars.As for the product itself, I haven't experienced any miracle yet, but I have been using it just for a little over a month. I have been recommended this product by many and I am positive that this product will help me with my condition.Regards,Tallahassee Guy"
1,Bought this for my two cats,"I bought this specifically to give to my two older cats. I purchased through Vitacost, and the ad stated that not only was the capsule enteric coated but that the serrapeptase granules were also enteric coated which meant I could put this in cat's food, and it would be digested correctly. This is not stated on the bottle so I opened a capsule and put on my tongue to test. The ""granules"" totally dissolved in my mouth!! So not good at all for pets plus this was false advertising. I'm also reading now that it should not be taken with food, so I'm at a loss as to how to give the Serrapet (specifically for pets) pills to them!"
5,Immediate relief,"I have had no energy for far too long. Blood pressure & Sugar was far below levels that makes one feel like a functioning human being, and then there are some other things that made it worse. Nothing worked, Exercise made it worse and just existing in my bed & chair was not a life, it was merely existing, for months and months.Then with some miracle I ended up at a natural healer who told to take Serrapeptase. He explained what it is, but not why I should take it. I listened and have not looked back. It is my fuel. Without it I am useless, literally, but as long as I take it, I am functioning and energetic and just Normal. If silkworm spit is what it takes to make my body work, then silkworm spit I shall eat until I keel over one day."
3,Cone13/14,"Before I purchased this product, I was using some cone wrenches I got for free from a bike store.I have used this item a while now. It suits the purpose I purchased it for."
3,A Little On The Light Side,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as I have the other books in this series. The action scenes were very good, but the plot was a little thin. I missed reading about Mutt, the homestead, and the folks back home. Still, a pretty good read."
4,Life in thewilderness,I thought this book was very interesting it gave a clear idea of what life in the Artic wilderness was like and also one could imagine the beauty of such wild surroundings and the hard life of the peoplethere I shall certainly purchase more of the boks by this author
5,Compelling,"I purchased this book at random and found it so intriguing and compelling that I am now reading her 9th book in this series. I am drawn in to the characters, the setting, the storylines. I highly recommend these books for anyone."
5,Terrific no fat frosting,"Have been using Betty Crocker fluffy white frosting mix for years, and the angel food cakes I bake and frost are pretty and delicious. The chocolate cake and this frosting are also scrumptious. My grandchildren state these are their favorite cakes of all time, and they are lower in calories than most cakes because of this low fat, yummy frosting. I highly recommend this product."
5,Just Like Homemade,This frosting is just like my dad used to make only he had to stand over the stove beating it with a mixer forever. It tastes exactly the same with little effort. I use it all the time and give several boxes away. I can't find it in the stores so I was sooooo glad to find it at Amazon.
5,Betty Crocker Homestyle Frosting Mix,"Not sweet, light and delicious. Hard to find in stores but thankful Amazon carries it. Try it once, you will never go back to canned frosting."
5,"cake icing, divinity candy mix,","I purchased this item because it is no longer available in the stores in my area. I wanted to try a divinity candy recipe I had and it called for a box of white frosting mix. The candy turned out real well, the only drawback is, that it takes several days to ""dry"" out. But it still beats the other recipes I have tried.....and failed at. ;("
5,love this frosting mix,"Love this frosting mix! Can't find it in the grocery stores anymore. Tastes like 7 minute frosting, in a mix. Everyone raves about this frosting when I make it ( and they want the recipe). Definately glad I have found this frosting mix again."
2,not for wedding cakes or professional cake decorating...,"i'm a professional cake decorator and wanted to see how this tasted, frosted and if it could give a smooth texture, but it can't.The texture is like marshmallow fluff, so it's almost impossible to have a very neat and clean look to it.On the bright side, it's definitely convenient and easy to make (just add boiling water) and is great for simple home baked cakes.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking to make professional looking cakes though. Home made is better :)"
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE!!!!,"IT IS VERY DISTURBING WHEN YOU PULL THIS UP UNDER THE GLUTEN FREE SELECTIONS!!! THIS ITEM IS ""NOT"" GLUTEN FREE!!!!"
4,Betty Crocker Home Style Frosting Mix is great,The Betty Crocker Home Style Frosting Mix is difficult to find in our area and several of my friends like it for one special recipe and really appreciated finding it at Amazon!
5,"THE Best Frosting mix, EVER","This is absolutely the BEST frosting I've ever used !! SO much better than the stuff that comes in a can, and easier than making my own from scratch. Everybody raves over this frosting and, it has no fat !!!!!"
4,This book stinks -- literally!,"Medieval Muck is a lot of fun. In addition to the smells (they're not ALL bad), there are many bits of historical trivia. For example, you'll learn more than you ever wanted to of the death of Thomas Becket. Kids who like the Goosebumps books will probably love this series. I can't wait to smell my way through more history."
2,Disappointed,This was OK as far as readings go but the format was disappointing because I got bored with watching him read.
3,A very good collection of a variety of Celtic artists.,"This video is a showcase for a variety of Celtic artists. The best part of the DVD is the music and the interviews... unfortunately, it is the worst part as well. While the music, interviews, and aritsts are all credible, the video never gives us even one complete tune. So if you're looking for a good cross section of modern Celtic aritsts from Great Britian and Canada, and you don't mind the snippets of music, this may suffice. If you are looking for the music, you may be disappointed."
1,Not what I expected.,"Like Reviewer Jon Mau, I feel disappointed and cheated with this DVD. I am a great fan of Celtic Music and expected something more than a documentary with snippets of music. OK for viewing ONCE, hardly something I would want to see again. ""Very misleading packaging! '"""
1,This was the worst DVD that was ever created,This DVD was useless. It had nothing to it. There was nothing that you could possibly get out of this DVD.
3,An interesting fusion,"This album is a fitting companion for Ana Rita Simonka's ""Bossa Nova Delhi"" in which she fuses bossa nova with Indian classical music.""Bossa Nova Delhi"" IS exotic&unusual; with Indian vocals.Here,in the ""Afro-Brazilian Project"",Ravi combines the African sound of the kora with native Amazonian music along with samba&bossa; nova.Overall,it's an okay album.The opening samba is excellent,as is ""Koracao Brasilero."" ""Driving to Buzios"",""Paranagua""&""Berimbao"" are fun,jazzy numbers.The only unnecessary track is ""Bird of Paradise"" in which Ravi attempts to sing.He should stick to the kora;it's his talent.""Amazon Journey"" is a fascinating collaboration with Marlui Miranda,who's also on Putumayo's ""Inuit to Inca:A Native American Odyssey."" She brings native Amazon music to Ravi's kora music.For those who enjoy world fusion music,this is great for a personal collection."
1,"I love this show, but....","I love Gash Bell, but I wouldn't buy this DVD because it is edited and only available in English. I watched the fansubs of this show, and it really isn't something to miss. But the voice actors in this series bug me to no end, and I never support the editing of content...at least without an un-edited version available."
1,Belief Based Instruction,"The philosophies of progressivism run deep and are often not amenable to rational discourse. That's the case here. Nearly 100 years worth of research converges on one simple, unassailable fact: Phonics taught systematically and directly is the key to the successful teaching of beginning reading. The logic in this book is difficult to follow because it rests on beliefs rather than the best science. Please read ""Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children"" or any of the research reports commissioned by Congress within the past three years."
3,Plenty of info - not all of it accurate,"This volume offers a wealth of info on the Endeavor, from deck fittings to rigging details. The largest compilation of data in one source I have ever come across. I am however, disappointed in this book - especially for the sales price.Unfortunately, the claims of a ""detailed fold-out plan"" turned out to be a side elevation only (and there are already several of those within), and the ""scaled drawings"" in the text are not accurately scaled and conflict with the stated dimensions elsewhere. For example, the ship's keel length is listed as 81'-0"", yet in the scaled drawings she is over 90' - and many of the detail drawings are not even scaled, and are of minor use to the modeler.If you want this book to be a general reference of the ship, you will not be disappointed - but if you buy it believing the statements of the publisher, and the previous reviewers, you will be ."
4,Captain Cook's Endeavour,"Cover is headed up 'Anatomy of the Endevour' and that is exactly what you receive, includes photos of various models of the Endeavour, followed by photos of full sized replicas. The rest of the book includes diagrams and an incredibly detailed breakdown of all external parts of the Endeavour. A must read for anyone contemplating construction of a model of the Endeavour or anyone with a historical interest in the Endeavour. Very limited internal detail of the Endeavour included which is unfortunate."
5,Ideas that will change the way you invest,"Look in the paper and find out how many funds are beating the S&P 500 or their appropriate index. Historically this is very few. And the one's that do well this year or two don't have long-standing power to stay among the leaders. And if you do find a fund that can beat the index, how much are they charging in fees and load that is eating into their margin of victory? After reading Mr. Bernstein's insightful guide into the history and psychology of investing I feel more confident in my new plan than I ever have before."
3,New edition?????????????,"Like Bogle, this is probably the best advice on investment you can obtain HOWEVER....I would have easily given it a five star but, Bernstein engages in the marketing tactics of the mutual funds (he scorns) who do the same in order to sell/market to make more money on increased volume(shame shame). He doesn't update the text throughout the book to represent the recent economic events (like a typical college text book). He adds a college midterm paper length addition at the end of the book to update recent economic events. I advise, buy the cheaper original version and read the added ending on amazon in the ""search inside this book"" link (if they don't get rid of it after I make this post). Dr. Bernstein, you have a fiduciary responsibility to be better than this ""new edition"". Please refund."
5,Great Boook,Excellent Book. This is the book I recommend to all people who are just learning about investing. It really provides solid advice on what asset classes to invest in and how to properly allocate your money. It also provides a little investor psychology and history that will give one confidence in times of ugly bear markets. I do not happen to agree with everything Dr Bernstein says. I strongly believe that an investor who can devote considerable time to investing and takes a value investing approach can beat the market. However for the 99.9% of people who do not fit this criteria they should only buy low cost index funds from Vanguard as the book suggests. I wrote an article on asset allocation and I recommended this book as the number one book for a new investor. You can see my article on the link below:[...]
5,Four Pillars of Investing,Excellent book filled with common sense wisdom on investing. Very readable and easy to follow. I'm tired of paying a financial firm and advisor to lose money for me. I can do that myself. I wanted a broad overview of investing and some straight forward discussion of market dynamics. This book provides it in an easy to read presentation of investing history.
5,Ignore that it was published in 2002,"This book starts by explaining risk and return from a historical perspective, from the middle ages to present day. The concept of bonds, stocks, then the market as a whole is gradually introduced. Great perspective.It also teaches fundamental concepts of investing in an easy to understand way (Chapter 2 was a bit rough, but the information is essential to understand).A book that teaches basic concepts should still be relevant years after it was published. No problem here. It covers what to do in bad economies as well as good ones. The only update might be to add the recent downturn as yet another example."
3,For the serious reader,"A well written book with a lot of detail about the history of investing. It is not as fun and easy to read as the author's latest book ""The Investors Manifesto."""
2,"Old information, lack of vision.","The book present only old information viewed from a pessimistic point of view, and reminds us that figures don't lie but liars' figure. The first part of the book emphasise the need to be sceptic in face of various financials annalists and the second tries to sell a system of investment from one of these financials company that we should fear. Mrs. Bernstein is probably one of the best salesman for that company, at least is book is."
1,Erudition Spoiled by Intellectual Dishonesty,"The best single critique of the efficient market theory was done by Warren Buffet in ""The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville."" Bernstein never troubled to address it."
4,A different Film,"This film has several stories going on at the same time, but it is easy to follow, the emotions are real, and it is not difficult to follow."
4,Handy Handle Cover,"The Lodge handle mitt is convenient to have, although it's best to keep it off the pan while in use and only expect to pick up the hot pan for a short period of time to move it. It does insulate to a point, but not for a long period of time."
5,Just What I Needed,"This Handle Mit for my Cast Iron Frying Pans is just what I needed!Not too big and ""galumphy""; hangs up for easy access."
4,Good for the short term,This mitt does the job that it is made to do but to me I think that it will not make it past a year. I have used it for a month now and it is showing signs of heat melting the outer liner. I do have to say it fits the handle very well and also my hand. When you pick up the pot you know that you are not going to be burned and you will have a good grip on the handle.
5,"Lodge Max Temp Handle Mitt, Black",This was one cool item. Fits over the handle of your iron skillet fits perfect. Made to be heavy duty. Very well made. And priced right to. A great accessory for your iron skillet!! A must have item for sure.
5,Work great!,Work very well with my cast iron skillets as long as you do not leave them on the handles for long periods of time.
5,Useful and Unobtrusive,I find this black handle mitt to be indispensible. I do a lot of outdoor cooking in the summer in cast iron cookware and handling hot cookware can be a challenge. This handle mitt takes a lot of the challenge out of that equation. It can handle up to 450 degrees with its well-designed lining. I feel very using this mitt and it seems to grip rather good as well. You can hang it up after use. I find this mitt to be very useful and unobtrusive.
4,As Advertised,"Works on the Lodge fry pans and is a little thinner than a regular hot pad. Does the job intended, so it is, As Advertised."
3,Works Great When It's Not Wet or On Fire,"I recommend this product if you have an electric stove. If you have a gas stove, though, you might think twice before buying it. I've lost track of the number of times I've been cooking, smelled something burning, and then realized that it was the handle mitt. If the stove flame comes anywhere near the edge of the pan, there is a risk that this handle mitt could begin smoldering. And if you douse the mitt to put out the flame, then it is useless until it dries again - when wet, it does conducts heat straight from the pan to your hand. On the plus side, even though about 10% of the mitt has now burned away, it works beautifully when it's not smoldering or wet."
3,Works okay,"I bought this to use with my cast iron skillet, and I have mixed opinions. I learned the hard way that you cannot just leave this on the handle - it will burn and produce acrid smoke. So I leave it next to the stove and only use it when I absolutely must move the skillet. It's an okay compromise, but next time I'll likely try a silicone handle."
4,A little Loose Fitting,"I used this for the first time today and found it very functional, although a little loose fitting. Be careful when lifting the heavy skillet so that the hangle doesn't turn within the mitt. After five minutes, I mastered the technique."
2,Not a glove,"I had assumed this was an mitt that fits over the hand. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be 1x4"". There is no description of this item in the ad, size or otherwise. I spent $10 for two figuring one for each hand, way too much money for what I recieved."
1,HANDLE mitt ... FITS ONE FINGER ONLY,"Perhaps I read poorly and/or too hastily, but was expecting an oven mitt that my hand would fit into. This is, as listed, a HANDLE mitt. I am slim and can only fit one finger into the tiny little thing....can't use it for a handle or anything else."
1,Too small to use,"Maybe I don't know how to use these mitts, but they are tiny--too small to put your hands inside and too small to wrap around the handle to use. I don't understand their use. I unwrapped them before really looking at them or I would have returned them."
3,Scorched after very few uses,"This mitt is good at insulating handles from heat... one can hold the skillet comfortably without feeling the heat. I don't think this thing can resist as high temperatures as stated on the product description because mine has already scorched at the edge where it comes in contact with the pan and as a result the fabric is fraying badly. I have never left the mitt in place while cooking, I have only used it to move the pan from the stove to the sink or to lift the pan to serve meals from it so I guess that the black fabric covering the outside of the mitt is not very heat-resistant."
5,Good mitt,"Fits perfectly over my cast iron skillet handles, and I can keep it on even while cooking. One word of caution, however, this thing is worthless when wet. If it gets wet it will conduct heat and burn you. (But, really, this is just a matter of physics and any cloth-based mitt will behave the same way)."
1,meh.,"the fine people of lodge make the best cast iron products on the market, hands down. unfortunately, i cannot say the same with their mitts. i was careful to keep it away from the heat and flames, but it still couldn't take the heat. it has fallen apart in no time at all. bummer."
1,Caught fire on the first use,"The first time I used this, it caught fire. It was no where near the flames, but the fire resistant mitt caught fire. If it burns on the first use, it's not worth the $5 I spent on it."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I am new to cast iron and this mitt has definitely kept me from burning my hand. I push it on the handle all the way when I pick up the pan, and pull it back about 1"" from the pan edge (so it doesn't scorch against the hot edge) when I sit the pan back down on the heat source. I then leave it on the handle - pulled back slightly - while the food is cooking.It's loose enough to slide back and forth like that easily and thick enough to protect my hand. I am very happy with it!"
3,do not leave on the skittle,I left this on the skillet while cooking and it began to burn. But it works well when not left on while cooking.
3,Really Small,This isn't what I thought it would be. Very small mitt that just fits the handle of the pot. Not too substantial. It works okay.
4,Perfect Fit,"Bought to accompany a Lodge 12"" Pro-Logic, it fits perfectly, doesn't slide about too much and stays reasonable cool even if left on while cooking. (Although it WILL warm up after a while.) Good product, a must for a new skillet."
1,don't wash them!,"I must have missed the one-star reviews on this mitt, because they are really bad.You could see the poor quality even through the plastic cover they shipped in, with unravelling threads and a strange sheen to their surface. Once removed from the packaging, they were sticky to the touch, so I tossed them in cold water in the washing machine and went to check on them later.Completely faded and left black dye everywhere.This was an impulse buy @ $7/each and I regret it. Will be looking for a better alternative. I suggest you do too!"
4,Works Well,"This mitt works well, but if you are cooking something at a high temperature ( > 400 degrees F, or so), the heat can penetrate the material."
3,"Not terrible - but not great, either.","I own 3 Lodge cast iron skillets. I love them, but they do get 'rocket hot' when they are in use. I purchased the Lodge Max Temp Handle Mitt because I figured it would be easier to use than a standard oven mitt. I was right about that - it is easier to use because it fits onto the handles of all my skillets. But, what I don't like is that this little handle mitt tends to scorch easily with normal use, so I probably won't buy another one."
2,Was nice,"I usually used a towel over the handle of my cast iron pan. I was excited to get this because it seemed more convenient. When cooking, I pulled it off part ways so it didn't get as hot. After a few times, the inside was singed and I had to throw it away."
2,Not so great at protecting hand for more than a few seconds.,"If you're using the Lodge skillet as a serving piece, the cover works well to prevent a dinner guest from grabbing the hot handle and burning themselves. If you're planning on using the cover as a pot holder to protect your hand from heat while you're serving, you better server really fast. After a few seconds, the heat transfers through the mitt, and it's painful to keep holding on."
4,"Could be a bit longer but overall useful, and a good value","This is just a few bucks, so how can it not be recommended? Because cast iron is so heavy, I like to ""choke up"" on the handle, holding the handle closer to the pan, and this handle mitt doesn't extend past the handle enough to allow me to hold it where I want without being cautious. If it was longer, I wouldn't worry, but as it is, one needs to be careful. Still, for less than $3 (at this writing), it's nice to be able to put this on the cast iron pan's handle while it's on the stove and leave it there while cooking, rather than grabbing an oven mitt every time I want to grip the handle. This is a useful too, and an exceptional value."
1,toxic smell and smoke when pan handle heats up,"This product is flawed in that the material used starts to smoke from inside the handle after the pan handle warms up. This creates a toxic smell..that is very poor for the food and probably to inhale. Also, the shipping charges are ridiculous, because this item would ship for about 90 cents by first class mail."
1,"Flammable, flimsy and flawed","These mitts are poorly constructed from flammable material. They don't hold up in the wash, the color comes off easily, and they melt and burn far too easily. I have a flat glasstop stove, so there are no open flames, but if these mitts are within 2-3"" of an active burner, they will quickly heat up and start to smoke. Once that happens they are brittle and charred to the point of being unusable."
1,This item,"I love lodge equipment. This is one of the do NOT buy items they offer. Cast iron skillets, griddles etc are great. Do not be fooled as I was into buying this over priced item that is pretty much useless."
3,Saved my fingers !,I wondered when I ordered this what on earth I'd ordered but after almost burning the tips of my fingers off last week now I know. It slipped over the handle of my Lodge skillet just perfectly and saved my hand from a major burn !
2,MADE IN CHINA,"I try to buy stuff that is made in USA, hence the Lodge Cast Iron cookware. You think a company like Lodge could find a way to make these in the US. How much money are they saving?Oh, it gets 2 stars because it works"
3,Wish it was a little thicker padding,"At first it worked well. But just like the other reviews say, you'll need to remove it on occasion because the pad will get too hot and it also cinges. Hopeful a better product comes out soon."
4,good,"need this product for the cast iron products, recomend this and is easy to use and spares the burns and pain"
3,might burn with cast iron,"Okay, my wife got these for use with her cast iron skillet(s) - I don't know, maybe the description says something about use with cast iron, but they started to burn (well, actually smoke lots - no actual flame). I told her, maybe she should use with the other (many) pots that she has, but she was not happy and ended up tossing them out. Otherwise, good quality and well made, just may not work on cast iron."
5,This lil Handle Mitt rocks,"I wasn't sure if I needed this handle mitt since I have various pot holder and mitts...BUT this little handle mitt is perfect. It keeps my paws from getting scorched, and fits then skillet handles just right. Someone had a clever idea when they made these. Glad I got one."
5,Lodge Logic 12-inch skillet,"A cast iron pan is just the perfect pan to use for sauteing, frying and even making French Crepes. The handle mitt is great for easy and ready to use mitt. The polycarbonate scrappers are good but not a necessity. Just use a metal spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan if needed. This pan does not have to be pampered. The Lodge Logic 12-inch pre-seasonned skillet is the best. I am glad to own a couple and it did make my daughter-in-law very happy."
5,IT WORKS,this is a handy little item if you cook with cast iron. Just slip it over the handle and viola not burn at all.
5,Great for Iron Skillets.,"This is a very useful pot holder forcast iron cookware. However, sincecast iron gets very hot in the oven,one cannot hold it very long. I also usea pot holder over the mitt."
3,"good heat protection, but the cover slips","we primarily purchased this to cover the handle of lodge ableskiver and lodge round griddle for use on ceramic stove top.The mitt/glove is good from a heat protection point of view. This is made in China with inner lining made of white cotton. Outer layer + threads seams to be coated or made pyrotec?? material.Beware:if you try to hold the mitt/glove/cover and move or lift the pan/ableskiver, it slips. The mitt does not hold tightly the handle."
3,better than nothing!,This handle is inexpensive and fits the cast iron skillet's handle prettttty well....frankly i only gave it 3 stars because it falls off and it just wont stay on there well...i would prefer if it had a tighter hold tot he skillet so it stayed on better... but other than that it does not transfer the heat through the mitt and i definitely recommend getting it otherwise i would have surely burnt my hand by now.... =)
4,Handle Mitt,"Have two of these little Handle Mitts, they work pretty well with my Lodge Cast Iron Pots. They can't stay on the handles too long though. But for a quick pick up of the lids and hold on the pots, It works good enough for me. Would I buy these again, Yes!"
2,Will use only until I find something better,"It does keep you from burning your hand but the quality of the product leaves a lot to be desired. The first time I used it was on a 12"" Lodge fry pan. The heat from the fry pan (cooking my burgers on high gas flame) melted the edge of the mitt (see my pic of damaged mitt above). Still usable but not good quality at all. I expected much better from Lodge, especially for the price of this item!!"
5,MUST HAVE ITEM,"This is a great addition to iron skillet cooking. I know a hot pad works just as well, however, this little item is neat, I just leave it on the handle of my skillet so it is always there for my protection against burning my hand on a hot skillet handle."
1,A waste of money,I thought this would be larger. It does fit the handle but a normal padded pot holder folded in half would do the same. This handle mitt isn't as thick as some of my pot holders which cost less and do a better job on covering handles on cookware.
