4,"Good movie, great actors!",I really liked this movie and love the actors. Would recommend this to someone else for sure!
5,Great book.,"Good information for all. If your a history buff, you need this book as part of your library of history."
4,blah...blah...blah...I still love it.,"I see the game is getting crappy reviews. I got to say I have had a ball with it. Interviewing new coaches is pretty frustrating, and your Scouting Director is an idiot, that I will admit. I find it refreshing not to have to control the players during the game. Calling plays, instructing player strategies without hitting the square button and the triangle to initiate a superhuman move to gain 5 more yards. The players seem to act as the real ones, I am coaching the Eagles and McNabb is an idiot in the game too. One correction from a review above, you can speed up the draft by simming to your next pick.The game clearly needs some work, but I am having fun with it. If you love the game of football and like x's an o's, and developing game plans, you'll probably like this game. Its a football strategy game not to be compared with Madden. To enjoy it you really need to be a student of the game first."
2,"Dissapointing, but there is potential","I was so excited to get this, and I was very disappointed. It is really hard to get through, and takes forever. However, I believe it is a great start, and could become a great title in the future. I'd wait for Madden, and check out NFL Head Coach '07."
1,Unbelievibly booooorrring,"I really thought that this game would be better. I liked the interview system, but with the mind-numbingly long load times and time waster ""office time"" it was just too much. I took it back the next day."
4,Great Camera...terrible company!,"I received this camera from my Dad for Christmas the year before last...never had a problem with it until January of this year when it decided to not turn on. I thought it was the battery, but it wasnt. I sent it in, it cost $94 to fix it and then less than a month later it broke again..after plenty of screaming they sent me a UPS label to send it in with, and now its going to be at least another 2 weeks before its returned. I hate that it is broken, because i really LOVE this camera..but dealing with Casio is useless. I am trying to avoid buying another casio...although i think they take great pictures."
3,Great little camera,"I purchased this as my ""bar"" camera to back up my Nikon D80. Love the size and features and price. It take great photos but be very careful!!! My screen cracked after a few weeks and it was never dropped or abused. Casio wants $100 to fix the screen of my 1 month old camera. If you are very gentle with it I am sure it will prove to be a great camera. DON'T PUT THIS IN YOUR POCKET!"
5,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful little camera. It takes great pictures even in low light situations, i rarely have to use the flash. I have 2 dogs that are always on the move & with a steady hand the pictures almost never blur. The ""best shot' is a great feature that really comes in handy!! The best part is this camera is so small fits right in your pocket, a sure way to always get that perfect picture."
2,Not thrilled after a year of use,"Auto focus diminished after several months, had to send back to Casio for repair. Menus/Lettering on the shell of the camera began to wear off but Casio wouldn't include this under warranty to replace as they would have to replace the entire shell. Always felt the delay was too long for taking photos. Not really happy with it so I am giving it to a friend. Going back to Canon. Can't beat the size though....unfortunately, that comes with image sacrifice."
1,Bad Customer Service,"I had returned this camera twice already and it is still not working great. The pictures get blury at times (focus issues). When I sent it back under warranty they ""fixed"" it and sent back to me without my usermanual or the little handle string! I asked for it back and never got it back. When I realized the focus issues weren't solved I sent back and I got it in the same condition!! Bad customer service... I will send it back the third time!"
4,Almost perfect digital camera!,"I like a lot of the bells and whistles of this digital camera and feel that most of them work great!The only drawback I've discovered with this camera is that a small amount of the digital pictures taken appear blurry or out of focus, which I find frustrating! My previous digital camera, which I owned for 3-4 years had a few of these types of pictures but far less of them than the Casio Exilim EX-S600. I thought the anti-shake feature on this Casio Exilim EX-S600 would help prevent the blurry pictures from happening at all."
5,"For its size, a great value","First Law of Photography: You can't take a photo if you don't have a camera. I never go anywhere without this shirt pocket marvel, and consequently have captured lots of pictures that otherwise would go unrecorded. This is no mobile phone quality camera - with 6 mp and 3x optical zoom and lots of other features, this thing is a great deal. And.. you can KEEP some family pics or other favorites (OK-GO on Treadmills) to share with others.Thumbs up from me...."
3,Not a bad camera.,"My lug around camera was a hulking Nikon D200. I wanted something small to take on vacation and to the pubs, so, after doing some research, bought this. I won't belabor the upsides, just say it takes really good pictures. My only complaints are: the digital stabilization is a scam. Instead of using an optical system, Casio simply increases ISO setting which forces an increase in shutter speed. My other complaint is that after less than two years, the outer metal ring surrounding the lens fell off. Once dust and crap started getting inside the lens gears, the zoom and focusing eventually stopped working. I've since gone back to Canon for my happy snap camera and now own a Canon SD 800IS (which has since been replaced by, I think, the 870IS). I love my little Canons."
1,Worst line of cameras ever,This camera keeps breaking. It needs major repair every six months. The lens refuses to extend or retract. I had it repaired twice under warranty and now that the warranty is up they want $137.00 to repair it. It only costs about $130.00 to replace. I also bought myself an Z850 before my daughter's camera started breaking and that model is no better. It also has the same lens problem which they fixed the first time it happened. This time they say the problem is not coverered under the warranty. I will never buy a casio camera again.
5,Best Camera EVER!!!,"This is definitely one of the best investments I've ever made. The camera does everything I could possibly want it to. And even better than that is the great deal I got on it:$70 off, friggin amazing!!"
5,great camera!,"Best little camera! Does a wonderful job, so easy to learn. I bought one of these camera's for my daughters family, they loved it! My other daughter liked it so much, bought a 2nd one for her family. I have a digital paid 3 X the money and doesn't do near the things this little camera does! Very much a good price & camera. Want one myself!!!!"
3,Good camera ... once it works,"I had to return my camera TWICE while it was under warranty within first few months of getting it. Casio told me they'd reimburse for shipping the 2nd time and never followed through. Once camera was repaired the 2nd time, I found myself happy with the camera. It's convenient and takes good pix. The macro feature is only one I'd say isn't up to par."
4,Excellent Camera,"An excellent camera with lots of features. The menus aren't too difficult to use and the instruction manuel is sparse, but the camera works great in any light and has produced some GREAT pictures for me. Two thumbs up."
2,Awful Experience,"I received my Casio camera barely three months ago and have used it maybe three times. I took it out this past week to find it had just stopped working. It turns on then immediately shuts itself off, making a sound like a broken ipod even though it has NEVER been dropped and the exterior is in perfect condition. Casio told me to ship it to their headquarters at my expense. After reading the reviews here, I'm very worried about whether Casio will honor its warranty, even though this is exactly the sort of situation warranties are made for. Even before it broke, the pictures taken with the Casio were mediocre and it often blurred itself on auto mode. Even if they fix the problem or ship me a new one, I may sell it for a better model. The one positive that does stand out, however, is it's ""cool"" factor; it's very small and sleek and stands out from the crowd. With its record of breaking and okay pictures, however, I couldn't recommend this camera."
4,Great Videos!,"I was attracted to the video mode on this camera---with a 2GB memory card, you can hold about 2 hours of video on the highest quality setting. The ""Best Shot"" modes are great too and can also be used while you're shooting video; I use the scenery ones a lot and there is definitely a difference, and the ""night portrait"" mode is great as well. The only con I've run into is that changing the settings for things like macro mode, motion, etc., are not intuitive and are hard to find without reading the manual first, as opposed to my older Nikon Coolpix camera, where everything was obvious and simple."
1,Don't buy Casio,"Three days after warranty expired my Casio EXS600 stopped working. The lens would not open. I called the support number hoping they could offer advice on repair. They offered no advice except to mail it in to them. I questioned three days out of warranty would they do the right thing and service under the warranty. They said mail it in and they would review. They want $126.95 to repair and no mention of my question of honoring the warranty. From reading other reviews it looks as if Casio never honors the warranty. Now I have to pay them to ship it back to me still broken. I am going to pay it because otherwise they will we sell it for $125.00. Yes that is what they are doing. The repair estimate comes with an offer to buy a refurbished model for $125.00. So any of you that send in your camera for repair beware, not only does Casio rip us off not honoring the warranty they resale them if we don't pay them to ship back the broken camera. I'll never buy a Casio product again."
1,Broken and warranty not honored by Casio,"We've had this camera for 6 months. We loved it. Then the ring around the lens popped off after simply turning it on; it could not be reattached. The machinery inside was exposed. Casio took it back since it was under warranty, but, after we sent it to them, we were told that the lens ring was not covered. Even with their warranty in hand that stated everything (excluding the battery and power cord I believe) is covered, Casio insisted we pay nearly $200. In addition, we have been waiting 2 months to get the camera back (we still don't have it). We're so very frustrated. I would pursue them legally if I could justify the expense and effort. We are using the only alternative left to us of warning people about Casio's actions."
3,Inaccurate color representation,Nice camera but the pictures did not show colors accurately. I returned the camera. I have a Casio EX-S3 which is 3 years old and I believe the color representation from that camera is more accurate.
1,Made in CHINA!,"I've been a long time owner of many of Milwaukee's tools but this is the last! I wanted a heavy duty drill to replace the older Milwaukee that was stolen out of my shop and naturally went with a trusted name. Much to my surprise when I recieved this drill from Amazon I saw that it is MADE IN CHINA. Now I know that Milwaukee was bought out by some nameless conglomerate that puts profit ahead of everything else but would it be to much trouble, Amazon, to list were this stuff is coming from before we lay down our money? Believe it or not but there are some of us that would rather do without before we would buy any chinese tools. I may as well have bought some cheap POS instead of this drill if they both come from the same place.Thats it! Never again will I buy any tools from Amazon if they won't list origin of manufacture.I had to laugh when the other post mentioned this drill could ""dig a hole to China"". I thought well it would know the way!"
1,uggghhhh,"Anime and manga have to rate as the down side to art and eroticism...The art is childish and bland at best, more the art of someone on LSD and a migraine than true art. The ugliness of women with purple hair and eyes the size of trash cans does little for the imagination; this is the art of anal retentives, pure and simple.."
5,Essential reading on race in America,"Race relations in the US is a difficult topic, given far more to misinformation and polemics than meaningful analysis. Korgen, however, has not only sifted through all of the confusion to present a clear picture of contemporary attitudes and beliefs about race, but she has captured the effects of these patterns on the experiences of people who maintain friendships across racial lines. This book is eminently readable, enjoyable, and timely."
2,Performance,"I bought this camera for my son who is 6 years old. It is very easy to use and hence is quite convenient for this age category. Also, synchronization with a computer is very easy to use.However, its endurance is much less than optimal. It quickly consumes batteries. It freezes quite often for no specific reason requiring a forced restart through opening the batteries compartment."
1,Beware with buying notebooks at AMAZON,"I have bought 3 notebooks at Amazon, but didn't know that if you received a notebook with a defective screen (up to 3 pixels dead) Amazon didn't not replace the Notebook. Now I have a notebook with dead pixels in the middle of the screen and it's very annoying.I would have loved to know this before buying this notebook, so I'm passing this information to notebook buyers.Also sometime the pictures are incorrect.Hope it would help when buying a notebook"
4,Nice bear,"This bear is very nice. The only drawback was the size. We hoped the bear to be a little larger. We thought 19"" was going to be the sitting height, but it seemed to be the standing height. Not a big deal, just a learning experience"
1,gross quality,do not not not get this toy. it is so ugly. the fur is this horribly cheap clumped synthetic junk. don't be fooled by the cute expression in the photo. it does have that expression- BUT it is basically hidden by the nasty synthetic material all around it. threw it out.
4,"Great soft bear, however it sheds","I got this bear for my love and she loves it. However I didn't like how it sheds. Overall I love this bear, I just wouldn't give it to a young child who likes to slobber on it since the fur might get into their mouth."
3,Does not look as cute in person as it is shown in picture,"This teddy looked so cute in the picture, I just wanted my 4 year old baby girl to have it. But when it was delivered, it did not look as cute and my daughter was not at all impressed with it. She hardly played with it.It looks durable. It is nearly stiched."
1,NEVER and EVER order it,"I have ordered this considering it is a 19"" teddy but it is lesser than what it supposed to be. It is not even soft either"
2,"Not in ""Plan 9"" league","In my opinion, this film doesn't reach the ""so bad it's good"" levelthat Plan 9 from Outer Space does. In reference to an earlier reviewer:anybody who says Tori Spelling CAN act is nuts. ""You'll find yourselflaughing at the absurd, over-the-top acting of all characters involved.Tori Spelling's bad acting is to be expected, but it's an extraterrible masterpiece in Mother, May I Sleep with Danger. Her canoepaddling scene will have you in stitches as you watch her struggle touse the paddles. Ivan Sergei is laughable as the crazy boyfriend with apenchant for danger. Her mother (you know, the one she's asking if it'sokay to sleep with danger) is awkward and annoying."" Though planned tobe released in theaters, it couldn't find a distributor willing to showit and had to be shown on TV. That should tell you something."
5,Includes brilliant non-album tracks,"This single is so worth having for the otherwise impossible to find cover of ""World Shut Your Mouth"", which children of the 80's will remember Julian Cope having a moderate alternative hit with back in 1987. The other non-album track is a lovely Death Cab gem that would have easily felt right at home on the ""Plans"" album. If you're a Death Cab completist, or a fan of the Julian Cope original, this one is a must."
3,Adrienne Barbeau = yummy !,"Fairly interesting late 80s slasher flick about a killer who uses open house showings to find potential real estate buyers and cut them up real good, like. By ""fairly interesting"", I'm not claiming this film is particularly groundbreaking or that distinguished in the horror genre with the distinction of Adrienne Barbeau being totally naked in a couple of scenes."
1,Not worth the $ or the time,"I don't know how Carmen Rasmusen made it to the final group on American Idol, let alone how she managed to get a CD out. Although Carmen can sing, her talent is simply not up to par. She can carry a tune, but it's carried in a warbly bucket. If you enjoy singers that like to mimic the shaky, throaty noises created by most goats, then, by all means, this is the album for you."
5,OUTSTANDING DEBUT!!,"I just got this today and all I have to say is that it is simply outstanding! Carmen has come a long way since the debacle of AI, a show that desperately needs cancelling. The songs here are first rate as are her performances! I'm looking forward to the next CD....a full 14 song one!!"
5,All I can say is Wow!!!,"All I can say is Wow, after hearing Carmen's album! All of her songs are amazing! Photograph and Crazy in Love have a huge contry feel to it, and are very catchy. The one ofter 9:09 and I've seen a face are two Beatles covers and are amazing! Carmen has a lot of talent and I know she will be around for years to come!"
1,She shouldn't have been given the chance,"Even though I don't often watch the show she was competing on, I caught her performances a few times and couldn't believe she made it past the initial audition. She was just terrible and I don't think it had anything to do with her development or anything else, she just didn't cut it. It's for this reason she shouldn't have been given this chance even though she has an audience considering her overlong stay on the TV show. She just doesn't deserve this based on what she accomplished no matter how good it is."
1,chaos princess,"ENOUGH ALREADY.. if she can get a recording contract to sing four songs so can I,actually so can you."
1,Goat girl,"WHY on earth did this girl release an album? She can't sing for her life, she sounds like a GOAT!!! Why was she on American Idol? AI is a singing contest, not a YODELING contest! Her ""innocent"" act is pure crap. At least this album didn't sell. (As if it would) Her fifteen minutes were over before they started."
1,What the Hell???,"Does this girl actually think that she can release an album? I mean, she did pretty good on idol, but come on! How can she get a record deal when there are so many other great american idol contestents that we haven't heard from yet? And after two years of waiting, it is a four-track album? GOD! What a waste! I really did like carmen on the show though, and I do think that if she took her time and recorded a nice 13-track album, then maybe I would buy it. But I would never get this CRAP!"
4,Good strong voice,"Carmen has a good strong voice. She is able to show off her vocal abilities in this album. I especially liked ""I've Just Seen a Face."" This album is different; it pulls in several different styles such as rock, country, and bluegrass. She's a great role model, and my kids love her. I reccomend this CD to all of Carmen's fans."
1,False advertising,"I'm sure Amazon isn't intentionally misleading buyers, but they are.This does NOT include the post and rubber mount, which makes it entirely useless for older VWs.The quality of the trim I received was decent enough, but it was poorly packaged and it was cracked by another item."
5,Don't Go Greek Without It!,"Seriously, this is my Greek Lifeline. In a thousand ways. All your key charts and paradigms, neatly arranged and organized. The tough lamination is a must, because you will make this chart work! So nice to have everything neatly put together for study and quick reference. Plus, the laminated surface is dry erase marker friendly, so you can circle and mark things are you trying to study."
1,Not a must have,"It is a handy tool for reviewing, but you don't have to buy it. As he/she make progress through the first year of Greek class, one can make his own review or cheat sheets, more through than this one, focusing on the issues he/she need to learn better. Not to mention the reviewing and the systematizing work itself that can provide a great help in order to organize the Greek grammar knowledge in one's mind (using different colors and highlights, tips and tricks, and so on).You can spend your money more wisely by buying Mounce's BBG vocabulary cards, which are really helpful (unless you decide to make your own cards...)"
3,grammar,"I'm beginning to learn the Greek language. I need the words, not composition. So I only use a small part of this."
2,Not happy,This is a lamented bi fold and it came with one end folded which left a severe creaase in the item.
3,Review,Purchased for a greek classNot as helpful as i would have likedThree hole punches are not big enough to fi xin hole binder
2,a useless tool for serious students,"While this tool may be useful for one who just want to get a rough idea about Biblical Greek, it is useless for serious students with the purpose of getting a real master of Biblical Greek. The reason is that it lacks things that really matter.What you need is <Morphology Biblical Greek> by the same Mounce and <A Morphology of New Testament Greek> by James A. Brooks. The first as a workbook and the latter as a referrence book."
5,The second edition now covers Bombieri's approach to the Stepanov method.,"The second edition includes 3 chapters, whose contents were discussed in Schmidt's lectures (as noted in the first edition's Preface). Chapters 7 and 8 develop material on `Valuations and Places' and `The Riemann-Roch theorem', which are used in Chapter 9's exposition of Bombieri's approach to Stepanov's ideas.For the second edition, the whole text has been reset in an attractive typeface, and some inaccuracies have been corrected.Paperback, $49.00 ISBN 0-9740427-1-4 X, 333 S.ISBN 0-9740427-1-4The Kendrick Press has in November 2005 the address (520C N. Main St., Heber City,UT 84032) and shipping details ($5 within the US, $10 abroad). Its Homepage is[...]Professor Bombieri's own Heights in Diophantine Geometry will soon be published by Cambridge University Press."
2,proofreader should be fired,"I expect printed and hard-bound matter to have pristine grammar. Twice in the book I found one of the hugest mistakes in the English language:Page 26""Her mother likes it that way, though it makes Shelley look even younger than she is, more innocent, vulnerable before life's darker truths, IT'S evils...""Page 46:""We note IT'S odd markings...""The caps are mine, but the mistakes are not. How embarrassing. I just couldn't keep reading. What makes matters worse is that this is a young adult book. Way to go, editors!"
4,Excellent Resource,"I found Traveler's Sourcebook to be an excellent resource. Full of information and lists, to both entertain and help. Look for this book in your library, probably in the Reference area."
5,The Complete Blacksmith is well worth the Money,Well written with information you would not normally get from one source. Practical and useful info. Well worth the money.
5,Good book for those who want to learn.,It was very informative and had a lot of illistrations. They gave vareous technequies and the author gave a lot of his ideas. If your interested in bladesmithing or swordsmithing then you should read this book. Wheather your just starting or have been doing it a while this book will teach you new things.
4,Great instruction manual,"This book is great for anyone interested in makeing small blades. It gives a complete run down of all the required gear you will need, how to set up a workshop, where to source your materials from, how to make a forge and most importantly of all, how to actually make a blade out of a lump of steel. Very interesting, even if you have no intention of actually making knives."
5,Hot Topic!,This is a fun and informative book. A must read for men of all ages (and smart women with a sense of humor!)
1,Desert Trek,"Well made, comfortable and easy to care for. The color is a darker brown in person compared to the photo."
1,Original or not?,"i did not get the tag on the shoe which says ""clarks original desert drek so i'm wondering if this shoe is an original itemreally not pleased with this purchase because of that."
4,"Beautiful, but at a price","Pros:Looks great with almost everything.They break in nicelyScuff marks really add to the personality of the shoe.Cons:Sole is terribly slippery when wet. I guess that's why they're called ""desert"" treks--they're not supposed to get wet.No arch support. Personal preference.Heel too high. Also a personal preference. Granted, they'll eventually wear down, but right now it's just slightly too high above the rest of the foot to allow me to walk completely comfortably.Overall: You'll look great. Clarks last a long time (I've had my desert boots forever). If you do it right, you'll have to work into the shoes. But the rewards are great."
5,Great shoes!!,I bought these shoes for my boyfriend as a birthday present and he loves them... They look really classic.
4,an old timer still great,Great shoe to wear. Only comes in medium width so I had to bring to a shoemaker to expand the width. Had a pair 20 years ago. The old ones were made in England. The new ones are made in Vietam.
2,Bad quallity of the sole,"Not quite sure if it was a particular case but I bought this model in Clarks store, after 4 months of usage (normal walk) the sole in the zone where the sole bent, has broken. I noticed the sole material is quite simple. The shoes looks fantastic the first days but the shoelace unleash often."
5,Forget those desert boots!,"I own these and a pair of Clarks Desert Boots - gotta say I much prefer the Desert Trek. The biggest difference for me is the flat sole of the Trek and the heel on the Boot. I've always thought the point where the heel begins on the Boot was a bit uncomfortable - I'd never walk around a city wearing them, for example. Definitely not the case with the Trek, where I'm confident they would be comfy for a whole day of city exploring. In other news, if you have a pair of Desert Boots I would order a half size larger in the Desert Trek. I originally ordered the same size but had to exchange mine."
5,Nice shoes,Have enjoyed these shoes. Fit true to size. Great condition. Comfortable to wear. Really good price. Would buy again. Thanks.
2,review,I don't like the color. It's quite different from the picture. It is very dark brown with no variations as advertised. Maybe in a few years it will look like the picture.
3,Clark's Trek Oxford,Good-looking shoes but not to trek in. What you see on the outside is the only layer - you step into a thin layer of suede that will not stand up to elements. The bottom is rubbery and sort of gluey and the inside is thin.
4,Little low but comfortable when totally inside,Little low for me but comfortable when totally inside.I think I must wear them naked the first few days because I cannot get in with socks. It's too low for me.
5,Great Shoe great price.,I seriously love these shoes. so comfortable. I really don't know how much I can personally write about a shoe but this pair makes me feel like rambo and brad pitt all at the same time.
3,too small compared to same size desert boot,"Low stars because I never got to them try out. Bought the desert boot ankle high a little before. Oxford length was ok, but wrap around top of foot was way tight. Might try a 1/2 size larger on these. The desert boot ran a full size below just like another reviewer mentioned. I'd go 1/2 size below normal size on the oxford."
5,Exactly What I wanted!,Very Comfortable and just the right fit. I work as a teacher and they are really comfortable to be on them all day. Another great product by Clarks!
4,"good product, but...","No question that it is a good product, but you can buy similar product (not at Amazon) at half the price (including shipping). After I purchased Grizzly, I purchased a couple more Dollies for around $15 (shipping included). Quality of the Grizzly is better, but not two times better. If you need only one Dolly then go with Grizzly for better quality, if you need several look somewhere else."
5,Better than expected,"The dolly and the seller can't be beat. It is exactly as described by the seller and arrived sooner than expected. I looked for one at a local retailer, but came up empty. Thankfully, the Panther was available online."
2,Fabric not a good idea,I purchased this product to help me move as I thought UHaul charged too much for the rental. That was a mistake. All of my furniture kept sliding off of the dolly as the carpet does not have any grip. The UHaul dolly has rubber instead. I recommend you get a dolly with a rubber top instead of carpet.
5,Is as Advertised,"I bought this item because I live in an apartment building at the end of a long hallway. Whenever I have something moderately heavy, I have to lug it all the way down this hallway, so I figured that this cart would be the way to go, and it was. I have moved items of various sizes and weight, from a couple of cardboard boxes to a 36"" CRT television. It seems no matter the weight, the cart always goes the direction you push it and all of the wheels cooperate. Also, the wheels are large enough to go over door thresholds with no problem. The body of the cart is sturdy and the carpet wrapped around the two top cross members keeps metal items from getting scratched. All in all, it is a great item and I sometimes wonder, as I am making a trip down that long hallway, how I ever did without it."
4,a real back saver!,"this thing made my most recent move a breeze! we have an elevator in our building, but are at teh end of a long hallway. so being able to load up a whole cart of stuff at once and wheel it all the way down the saved a lot of time and my back! it's rugged and holds a lot of weight, even on the support slats. we did have a few problems getting it over some higher door thresholds, but it rolled very easily over asphalt, concrete, tile, and carpet. great product and extremely quick turnaround on shippign and delivery!"
2,Flimsy,Mine broke after one hour of use. The wood cracked like a dry stick. I ended up just using the wheels and rebuilding the entire frame. What's teh 900 lb capacity refer to? Wheels only I suppose.
3,Cookware set,"I ordered this cookware set because I like the look of it and price was right! In the picture it looks sturdy and made of heavy duty stainless steel...not so when I finally got it. Don't get me wrong, it does look nice and it's made of stainless steel - but the handles are hollow in the middle and get hot while cooking. I was surprised when I picked up the pan off the stove OUCH! HOT! I do like the larger and smaller sized frying pans and the steam holes on the lids add to the look and functionality. The handles on the serving utensils are also hollow inside so now I know that when I take them out of the dishwasher they need to be dried before putting away. Overall a good set, very functional, easy to store, easy to clean. I would suggest this set for anyone wanting to learn to cook or for a college dorm. It's nice but not for someone who truly enjoys cooking and it probably won't last a long time."
3,"metro cookware, are handles safe ??","I like the sizes of this set, glass covers are super. The steel is a little too thin,but it`s ok considering the price. I`am a little nervous about the safety of how the handles are attached , not something i have used before."
1,Don't Buy This!,"This is a terrible product. My wife bought this and was very disappointed. It turns out that most of the 202 games are shareware, and you need to pay additional fees to regsiter the games. Unless you wish to pay hundreds of additional dollars and go through the hassels of registering the games, you won't get full use of them - they will turn themselves off after a set period of time or after a few times you play them.

1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"This is such a RIP OFF! When you buy this product, you are led to believe that you are really buying 202 Palm OS Games. WRONG!!

5,Works great in hobart 140,Go to youtube and copy and paste inHobart Handler 140/190 Review and AdviceLook for the video made by redneckcomputergeakI have used this type of wire in my welder for the last 5 years it works great
4,"Great Music, Great videos but...","First of all: Mushroomhead must be one of the most underrated bands in the world. I really enjoyed finally seeing some of their videos (which are amazing) and on-stage performances (we don't get to see much of that in Denmark...) Unfortunately almost all of the behind-the-scenes footage was just the band making bad jokes...and the DVD is too short in my opinion... But for any fan this is a ""must-have"" object. Next time cut back on the jokes and make a DVD with longer running time!"
3,I love Sesame Street and Elmo but.....,"This dvd is misleading... Normally when you see elmo on the cover of a dvd you know he is focus but in this one they added Abbey show who I love also but she should have been on the cover as well. This dvd was ""bait and switch"" because elmo is not in every segment of this dvd just maybe 10-15 mins. Kind of disappointed because my son loves elmo so he was very bored with this dvd. If you purchase this dvd, purchase it because you love other characters because you will not see elmo alot."
3,"Good Compilation, Poor Mix","While Larry Tee puts together an overall good track selection, he does put together a sub-par mix cd. I have seen the man on turntables twice and know he has great mixing ability. To me, it seems the threw this cd together over a weekend. I hate to be harsh, but its true. For newbies to the dj scene, this is a good pick with great tracks. But for seasoned veterans and fellow djs, it is clear that very little effort was put into this cd and the mistakes are glaring."
4,Great,"""Plastique,"" ""John Starlight,"" ""Shout Out,"" and ""Airplanes"" by themselves are worth the price of this comp. Most of the other tracks are good too. ""Confusion"" is the only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars. The vocals on that one are just irritating."
2,Barely fits a Silver Smoker; gratuitously large ?,"I remember driving through Dallas once and thinking that they intentionally made some of the highway ramps ridiculously large because ""everythings bigger in Texas"" whether it needs to be or not. [Don't really know if that's true, it was just a thought going through my head].When I received this chimney and the rib rack from the same brand, I had a flashback. They're ridiculously large, almost gratuitously. The rib rack doesn't fit in my smoker at all (well, not if I want to actually close the lid and smoke) and guess what; this barely fits the firebox on my Silver Smoker. I can just barely squeeze it in there, and I definitely can't close the lid over it.I guess ""bigger is better"" for some, and if you have a really large grill or smoker and always wished for a bigger chimney, this may be the one for you. Frankly, I think it's a tad overdone and regret being stuck with it."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I wish some reviews had been posted for this when I purchased it 6 months ago! I bought it for the extra capacity and the feeling that the extra money would bring a heavier gauge steel...wrong. Pass up on this and stick to the sub $20 ones that last 2+ years of heavy use. Mine is a piece of garbage now...great concept, poor follow through."
3,it's good but could be better.,"Well we've only used it once so far but I was a bit disappointed. As soon as I got it I noticed that the black paint scratched off. Also, the handle doesn't stay cool as advertised. It did heat the charcoal well so I can't complain too much I guess. I also like the fact that it's a square container instead of a cylindar for controlling the coals. But for the price I expected a little more."
2,Bad paint job...,"I loved it when i first got this chimney starter, but it is definitely not worth the money paid for it, it should be cheaper. The paint is now peeling on each of the units i bought, seems that it can't handle the high temperature that the coals get to while getting ready. either they should use a better quality of paint or get rid of it all together. and i have no idea why it has that secondary metal handle, seems pointless. better yet, i know why it's there, but i never use it nor see the need for it."
1,Low quality and over priced,I own one of this. It quickly began falling apart after a few light ups. There are much better products at a lower price available. I must say I do like Raichlen's books and some of his other signature products (for example the grill gloves) but this one is really bad.
2,Over Priced Poor Quality,This starter is hyped as the best but it lasted less time than my old $20 version. One year and the bottom is gone.
4,pretty good,"I have had a number of Kershaws and have had my eye on this one for a while. after getting one upon first impression it was great, but after a little while of use and practice I noticed that the blade was hitting the tension spring. after a little bit of blade inspection I noticed that it was dulling the blade exactly where the spring was. Other than that issue the knife is great. The blade is very sharp and easy to stone sharpen, the design is very cool and after 20 minutes you can get the one-handed opening down solid. I called Kershaw today and they want me to send it back to fix or replace it... I hope this doesnt take forever. overall i would definately recommend kershaw as a brand, but this knife has given me a little bit of trouble."
1,Organic? Not certified.,"I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic ""Healthyway Organic Goji Berry"" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor. The 'Nutrition Facts"" on the label have some strange entries like ""Quantity of Heat"" and ""Thick Protein"" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a ""Product of China"" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be ""organic"" in name only and not in fact."
5,Great berries like I normally buy,"I normally get my goji from Asian markets at a cheaper price but since I don't get over there too often (kind of a drive) I decided to buy them online. Good packaging, great health benefits, lovely berries."
4,Text? What text? Who needs text?,"No bout a-doubt it, the pictures are the star of this show. We get a three or four page long architectural history of each cathedral, a couple of exterior shots, a view down the main sanctuary, and several closeups of various details, statuary, and art. Most of these cathedrals are so wonderful that they could be made the subject of books of their own, of course. But this visual symphony brings us up close and personal with arguably the greatest treasures the European Middle Ages bequeathed to posterity.The only mild disappointment for me is that not much mention is made of the gigantic lost abbey church of Cluny, which was in the late Romanesque style. One of the better uses of computer imaging these days is the virtual reconstruction of that edifice.Wonderful books like this are why coffee-tables were invented!"
1,Re: Waste of Money,"This platform truck is flimsy, poorly made, doesn't roll on uneven surfaces, is rated at 400 lbs, not 600 lbs. Nearly impossible to turn with a load on it. Wouldn't last real indoor/outdoor use for a week.Good seller though - no problem with communication or refund."
1,Fatal design/manufacturing flaw,"Klein tools are typically good quality products. This one is not.The steel shafts did not have ""tangs"" where the shaft engages the plastic handle. Result: the shaft spins on the plastic handle rendering the tool useless."
3,Cleans really well,"My BBQ has not been cleaned in a long time and was in great need of a full cleaning. After seeing how much nasty came off using this product I will definitely be doing annual cleaning after winter. Worked really well on loosening and softening the dirt and grime up. Have not had a chance to compare it to anything else but I did see a large section of cleaners at the local home improvement store.There are a lot of warning when using this product so you should probably get gloves to use it with. Also, the spray trigger broke... maybe because I am so strong (or cheap plastic). Good thing I had some empty spray bottles sitting around or I would have been really mad. Had to dump it into the generic spray bottle to start the cleaning."
5,She loves it!,"My cat can be a picky eater, but she will cry until I can get the can opened and get her food prepared. She's eager to eat, and her tummy handles it well too."
5,"9 Lives Seafood Platter, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)",My 3 finicky cats love it. Easy to pull of the tab top and put in a bowel. I like it coming in the 24 pack
1,nine lives seafood platter,"for some reason my cats won't eat nine lives seafood platter. its greasy , they turn the bowl over when I try giving it to them"
4,Who Lives Where? game,"While a couple of the animal blocks needed some sanding to make them fit well into their ""homes"" this is a game that will endure through many grandchildren. Our three-year old twins loved it and I can see that their 18-month-old brother will soon find it just as much fun as his sisters. This game is definitely a keeper!"
1,Terrible,"Purchased this boombox for my son for his birthday. AC power went out after using it 3 or 4 times. Put a new set of 6 ""C"" batteries and it starting smelling like burning plastic. Complete garbage."
2,Poor quality CD player,"We went through 2 of these in 3 months and both went back to the store with CD player problems. My son loved it while it worked - its a really cool looking little gizmo, and actually felt fairly well made, but it just didn't last (for us, at least), so we ended just buying a regular ol' CD boombox instead."
5,"Viper Cold Steel, Steel Tip Darts",These are outstanding. They have a good feel to them and are used daily.
5,Awesome sound.,Hey there guys. This was an awsome purchase that i did from you. i do appreciate it. You take care. Later.G
2,No new information,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Dre and Eminem fan but this book isn't worth your money. It has little to no new information for fans who have spent a little bit of time and surfed the web for bios and such. For those who say this book is great because Dr. Dre is one of the best rappers on the planet, they are mistaken. Dr. Dre is not a rapper, he is a producer. I'm not dissing Dre and Eminem, but this book is poorly conducted, any 7th grader with the internet could have thrown this together in about a month or so. Save your money and read something informative."
2,Few interesting facts,"I gave this book two stars because I think that the author could have done a better job writing it and looking for information. Although she tells the facts, the writing is too [disappointing]. The pictures in the middle are excellent, though. A little more effort and this book could have been excellent. Dr.Dre's story has a lot of interesting details, same as Eminem's."
5,Dance of Life!,"I was introduced to Dancing In Limbo at a cancer conference in 1995 after I had been diagnosed with colon cancer. The whole conference environment was ""Dancing in Limbo"". It made my family wake up to the emotional devastion I was facing. I realized I was limbo, and I needed to move on. At this conference, I was inspired by the authors of Dancing In Limbo, and I was able to have a life after cancer. To this day, I highly recommend this book to every new diagosed person I meet. After reading this book, I knew it was the ""Dance of Life""! (5 1/2 years later I am still living the dance!)"
4,you are not alone,"many of the feelings that I though were unique to me about my cancer, aren't unique at all. I started highlighting each sentence that applied to me. I was shocked at how much was highlighted. It doesn't matter that these women are describing a completely different cancer than mine...the emotions were the same"
2,Batteries are 'special',"The batteries look like regular recharable batteries. 600 mah NI MH. Well, good luck replacing these batteries. I got new ones that were the same 1.2V and NI MH but 800 mah (longer running). Though the batteries operate the unit just fine, the charger will not accept the batteries. At this point, it's cheaper just to replace he units."
2,Not worth the money,"I have had these radios for about 1.5 years now. In the beginning, they worked ok - not what I would expect for the money. One of the radios now has not worked for the last year or so. We use them mainly for hunting and can't depend on them at all. I have a pair of Uniden 12 mile radios that work constantly regardless of temperature, weather, terrain etc. The unidens are crystal clear up to at least 3 miles (the furthest test), the Cobras work sometimes at distances slightly over 1/2 mile. The radio that does not work will not transmit or receive without cutting in and out. I've talked to Cobra and they suggest that the age and use may have shorted out the PTT button. Seeing as how they have less then 20 hours on them, I don't feel the quality is very good. I would avoid these at all costs and go with a cheaper model (Uniden or Oregon Scientific - The $14 pair of O.S. have been used in the same conditions for over 10 years and I've never had a problem with them.)"
1,Follow The Link......And Save,"I may be missing something, but I own a pair of Cobra PR-4200s also made by Cobra. Other than the fact that the faceplate on the 4100s is blue, they appear to be exactly the same radio. Same range, appearance, weather option, features, everything. They are except for the color exact duplicates. The only big exception is the vast difference in price. The 4200s are $25 brand new, while you can't even get a pair of these refurbished for that price. The new price for them was listed at $70 as of this writing. If you are at all considering these radios I strongly advise you to follow the link enclosed and check out the 4200s. I left a very favorable review for them for both performance and price. They're an excellent basic two way radio, and the very cheapest radios with the NOAA weather option available on Amazon as of this writing...Cobra PR-4200-2WX VP Micotalk 18-Mile Range 2-Way Radio - 2 Pack"
2,Stopped working in 15 days,"The set seemed good. working indoors fine. Took them to Rocky mountains, but never got a chance to check the real range. One of them stopped working for no apparent reason. I did not drop them , the operating temperature did drop to 40 degrees, but that cannot be the reason."
1,Cobra range claims are exaggerated,"I bought the Cobra PR 5000 2-way radios that claim to have a 15 mile range. In reality, the range is a little over a mile on a good day. I have a pair of Uniden walkie talkies that claim to have 2 mile range and they perform better than the Cobras.Someone at Cobra should get in trouble for false advertising."
2,Watch out!,"While the questions and range included in this little book are really interesting, within two minutes of scanning the answers, we found several mistakes. Where was the editor on this one???"
1,Only One Star Because Of The Monkey,"Although I did not purchase this movie, I watched it on cable. While it was kind of 'cute', I agree with another reviewer that found the monkey to be obnoxious. It goes without saying that I enjoyed the Nazis being killed. But what would have made my joy even more is if the primate got scrubbed in the cross-fire be it by friendly fire or by the Nazis."
5,Wonderful Movie,"This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Really there isn't much more to say than that. I know that the previous review gives you a vauge overview of the movie, so I feel no need to repeat that. This movie intensely shows how your life can be affected by your past as well as how difficult it can be to over come that past. How true friends can pick up a friendship 15 years later, and still be true friends. How love can motivate you and help you heal. This movie can make you cry, and then laugh, all in a 5 minute span of time, and when it's over, chances are you'll sit there amazed and just want to tell everyone about it."
4,memories!,still fun to watch although i find it extremely difficult to suspend my disbelief after 3 decades. Hiyata with the beta capsule!
3,Way Back When.....,"Way back when I was growing up, my brother would religiously watch Ultraman. Every kid on the block loved this show. Ultraman is a whimsical reminder of my younger days! Although some of the english dubbing is a little off, sometimes switching back to japanese randomly....it's worth the few dollars that it cost. An interesting journey back to the retro days of the 60's/70's and the funky dubbing of japanese monster - super hero movies!"
4,"Ahhh, the memories...","I used to watch this when I was in elementary school. I am 35 now... I have been looking for this for a while and glad I got it, especially the price and quick shipping."
5,"Ultraman, The complete series",Fantastic DVD. You can select the language even. I really want to have the one for Ultra Seven series.
2,Language problem,"When the English language was selected,it would have English over play for about ten minutes and then suddenly the audio would be in Japanese. My grandson was so disappointed."
4,ultraman: the review,"I really liked the shows, it brought back a lot of memories of when I was a kid and I couldn't wait for each episode to come on. Looking back, I didn't realize how cheesy the costumes were and how phony looking the boats in the water are, but thats the fun of this show and I still LOVE it. I was a little surprised though, because I would be looking at an episode and then the audio would change to japanese and I would have to stop the dvd and then choose english subtitles to be able to read the dialoge to understand what was going on, other than that everything thing was great! I would still purchase the dvd even knowing that would happpen."
3,A real bang for the buck!,"I can't complain for the price. The very first Ultraman saga in its entirety in this collection! Dubbed in both languages and subtitled! The only drawback is that the picture quality is not HD. However, it looks good on CRT TV or a tiny HDTV. Well, I'm certain I'll buy the HD collection once it's out at a decent price but until then, this collection will do."
5,"A bit cheesy now in the 21st century, but I love it anyway","As someone else said, just watching and hearing the intro took me back 40 years.The first episode remains a lesson for children in responsibility and unselfishness even today.Ah, memories..."
4,Before entertainment became total mediocrity...,"...there was good clean fun known as Ultraman!As great as this DVD release is, the video quality is hardly up to par, with episodes that look as though they've been transferred from a VHS source. The show's entire palette is washed out and varying patches of noise and other severe video degradation issues consistently bog down the print. The quality does improve somewhat as the series progresses.An up-scaling DVD player or receiver, as in my case, is absolutely essential. Watching this series with the original Japanese track & English subs, is the way to go for the best experience. But for the older American fans seeking a dose of nostalgia, the English track may be your answer.All in all this is a dirt cheap set, that's good clean fun for kids, & youngish tokusatsu fans, like myself.A remastered edition would be very welcome."
3,Ultraman: The Complete Series,Brings back the kid in you! Oh it is a little campy. They even borrowed an old Godzilla suite. There are some episodes that have Japanese with subtitles. But all in all just a little funny to watch.
1,crap movie,this tv show or movie sucks. I tried watching it again like I did when I was younger but no this just sucks.
5,Ultraman ultra quick!,I saw this at Best Buy for around 50 bucks! Got it here so much cheaper. Came in the mail real fast and in excellent condition! Can't wait to watch all the episodes! Some I have not seen since I was 5 years old!
4,Great Collection,"This set is a really great set, and for this price its a great buy. As has been said in numerous reviews, if you like the early Godzilla films then you will love this set. This was my first time watching Ultraman, and its great. Its good campy fun that is a blast to watch. Sure the episodes follow the same formula, but its still great fun. The dubbing is pretty good, but when you turn on the English subtitles, they don't exactly line up. The thing that was never really talked about (while a minor point but it may be relevant to some potential buyers) was how the set is packaged. All the discs come in one case, but inside that case each disc has its own paper sleeve. This set is an absolute joy to own and for this price you'd be crazy not to try it out."
4,Just as cheezie as I remember - but so fun to watch,"The packaging isn't the greatest, but for the price what do you want. There are four total discs. The primary language is Japanese, but just hit the audio button to switch tracks and you are good to go.The acting is horrible and the strings show up a little more since it is remastered, but you can't afford to pass this series up. It's pretty funny."
4,"Memories, like the corners of my mind","OK, High brow material it is not. Its guys running around in monster suits doing flips and flops but its pretty awesome if you watched the show as a little boy. It is the full series and no its has not been remastered for DVD or Blu-ray. So if you think its going to look better then you remember it looking, or sound better, NOPE. It is completely watchable in its not 3d or non 5:1 dolby digital surround sound ness and is great fun. On a side note, since this was a Christmas present and had not even though of the show in years. I did a quick google search and found out that Ultra man is still being made today. On a trip to youtube,the show has changed cast several times and apparently there are other ultra men now but its still guys in monster suit running around except now you can't see the zipper. So to finish up, Great fun, Guys in monster suits rolling around, cheese factor - off the scale, worth every penny."
3,"Everybody ""Shuwatch!""","Five dollars for all 39 episodes of the 1966-67 ""Ultraman"" TV series? Count me in! Better still, the rubbery monster mayhem can finally be seen in its original Japanese-language version. The DVD packaging isn't the greatest, but the overall video quality is quite good. Fun-filled childhood nostalgia with no apologies."
4,Great set.,"I am a fan of Japanese movies and monster movies. i have had the snes ultra man game for years and only a couple toys. and i used to watch this on you tube cause i could not find it any where. this is a great value. the episodes are great, and it looks realy cool with the non updated look. They didnt clean up the picture. the sound is good, but on my copy i noticed that when im watching it dubed some parts are still in japanese. not on all the episodes but some, i dont know if this is because the parts that are in japanese were not here in america when it aired or what. but its cool. its just fun kaiju at its best, fans of godzilla will love this cause on episode ten he makes an aperance with a red fuzzy around his neck and a difforent name, but come on its him. guess they wanted to try to fool every one. no this is a realy good set for the money, if it was still the two volumes i would pass but i got this a couple days ago and this is awsome."
2,"It's just a new sleve, not new or remasterd DVD's","If you already own Ultraman Series One, Volumes 1&2, (as I do) then you already own this release. The only thing that is different is the box and the box art. The part numbers for each DVD are exactly the same. I was hoping that for this ""complete"" series, they would have resolved the licensing issue and released the entire set in English as was shown on American TV, but no such luck. Scenes within a single episode randomly switch between English and Japanese. The begining and ending credits are in Japanese with English singing. There should have been some indication in the promotion of this set that it was the same as the previously released DVD's."
4,this is what you're looking for,"It has all the episodes. I'm watching it on an old CRT so I can't say how great the quality is...I assume it has a low bit rate to squeeze the entire series onto 4 discs. But it seems to be good enough quality for the source material. Only giving it 4 stars because of the switching between English/Japanese (the English dubs are not the full episodes, so where they added back the Japanese-only scenes, it switches to Japanese audio with English subtitles). Not ideal but it works.For the price, getting this set is a no-brainer."
4,A blast from the past,"The film transfer and sound are just passing fair. That's going to happen sometimes with 1960s shows like Ultraman.The show reminds me of my misspent youth (especially Saturday mornings, and after school). There is an element of corniness here. Still, good clean aliens versus human fun, with guys in crazy costumes."
5,Back to the Seventies!,I was watching a movie the not long ago and they mentioned Ultraman in the movie. All of sudden my mind was takin back to my childhood and i could remember asking my asking my mom to put it on the T.V. When i was like 5 or 6 years old. Can't remember exactly but i Think it was on T.B.S.. I have not thought about Ultraman for decades. I jumped on Amazon and ordered the Complete series. It took my mind back to my childhood when i first put in the dvd . Amazing experience!!!! Even though the special effects are terrible for todays standards my 5 year old step son and my 13 year old step son love it. They want to watch it all the time. What a great find for the the Family minus mom (she hates it and almost anything else that is not on the wedding channel.LOL.). You can't beat the price either. A 4 disk set with all the episodes for 10 dollars.
4,Monster Fans Assemble,42 years old and it is GREAT to travel back into my childhood and share the FIRST POWER RANGER with my 8 an 5 year old sons.To give todays CG genration the ability to appreciate how far technology has come and how shows like Ultraman stand the test of time being the first at what they did setting the stage for all the campy shows of today that followed them.Buy Ultraman series and pass this treasure on to your little one in confidence they will enjoy.
3,Corny (now) but (still) cool...,"It is amazing how things from your youth that once was the next best thing to the next best thing are now just so ridiculous! Granted, I wanted this because I remember Ultra Man back when it first aired on US television, so taking upon consideration that technology wasn't really ""high tech"" can explain the sometimes nauseating feeling I get while watching this.In caveat, I am so glad that I received this as a gift...continuing on with my Dark Shadows series collection (which received these same sentiments, although I am continuing to buy/receive them...go figure!)"
2,ultraman the complete series,"This product was very reasonably priced, but the ediiting was not very good. The video would often switch from English language to Japanese and there is no way of changing it. The video was fairly good for footage of that era."
3,Ultra Stupid But Funny,"This has got to be one of the campiest series ever made, even by the Japanese. The monsters look like they were designed by fourth graders, but never to fear - the science patrol is here."
1,BAD QUALITY!!,"These DVDs were wonderful for the first month or so, but then they started to show picture fragmentation and eventually didn't work at all, plus broke my DVD player. The DVDs were not balanced so they rattled when playing - I should not have continued to play them so the damage to the DVD player was my fault. This was all the DVDs - not just one.I got these for my 4 year old and he LOVED them and is now so disappointed that they are broken. I want to get a replacement set but am loathe to do so thus far."
4,Another Step To My Otaku Realization,"I first saw Ultraman when I was ten years old and it had been revived in syndication because of the movie INFRA-MAN bringing new interest to the genre. Of course, the show was older than I was but I didn't care, watching on a monochrome TV in the downstairs rec room of our Pittsburgh suburb house.Watching it now, it perpetually surprises me how much I remember and how much I must have internalized. The tone is all over the place, mixing the tragic and the silly. But those monster and set effects! I'm still jealous and as an adult I know pros in the movie effects trades!I've only seen a fraction of the shows so far but I expect I'll be going back to these disks repeatedly!"
3,"A good show, but bad package","I was really looking forward to getting this. This was one of the best stuff to ever come from Japan. Unfortunately, disc No.1, and 2 did not play at all. So I never saw all the episodes of the series. The other discs managed to play some.So all you Ultraman fans out there... buy this at your own risk. Hope you get some decent copies."
3,I`t`s fast and fun.,ULTRAMAN THE COMPLETE SERIIES. is a good show it`s fast it get to the to the monsters right off the bat. good price`s for this dvd`s it came right on time. I never got to see Ultraman that much a lone time ago mybe two or so. It just came on ever now and then. it`s a good 30 min. show. so i gave it 3 star. only one little thing sometime you may have it on english dubbed and it will go to japanese dubbed but it will come back to english!!!!. but it`s still a good dvd to get. thank you.
4,Not That Bad,I find this wheel easy to use on Beetle Adventure Racing and using a car and hover craft in Diddy Kong Racing but don't push your luck and try to fly with it. The adjustments help just about any one feel comfortable
3,Instrucitons please,"The wheel handles fine. I am currently trying to master EA's Nascar Thunder 2003, and I find that I do not have the instructions for setting the sensitivity of the wheel.If someone could respond on how to set the sensitivity, or at least how to reset the default settings, it would be appreciated.Thank you."
5,This book is wonderful!,"Read it before you go the the Rocky Mountains. Then have fun exploring the places that are described. These women are awesome and I would love to meet the author, Janet Robertson."
2,Boring,"I did not like this book at all. The Wakefield twins, who the series is meant to be about,hardly featured in this book. It mostly deals with the story of Jean West and Sandy Bacon. TTHe storyline is very predictable and it ends badly. Not a good Sweet Valley High book."
3,Panther G7111 - Not exactly Heavy Duty,"With oversized inflated good tread wheels and a fairly large caring capacity you might expect this wagon to carry a load of cinder blocks with out balking. Unfortunately, if the load is over a 30-40 lb child the friction on the suspension builds up making it harder and harder to pull. It's a great wagon at a good price for pulling small children or light loads of their play things, but don't expect to use it to easily pull grampaw back to the house if he gets tuckered out pulling the kiddies around."
4,Does the Job,"We bought the wagon to use in the garden, hauling supplies, plants, weeds, etc. It does the job and the oversized pneumatic wheels are nice on rougher ground. Not too hard to put together, although the instructions are vague and left me scratching my head a couple of times. And, the packet of bolts contained more types than the instructions listed. The extras were not needed, but did cause some of my confusion. Once assembled, it was exactly what I wanted."
5,Wonderful season,What can I say the Cosby is a great show. I received my product timely and I am very pleased with the packaging.
2,The Cosby Show Season 3/4,I of course love the show and I sure wish they could come up with something this cute and meaningful today. ut I don't like the way the DVDs are organized. I would rather be able to click on all and then jump forward to the one I want to watch so I can just watch them consecutively and not have to re-start every show.
3,Why pay more?,"Let's just do some math here. Season three separately costs $14.49. Season four separately costs $14.99. (to date mind you) $14.49 + 14.99 = 29.48. How much does this set that holds both seasons cost? $34.95. Hmmm... which is a smaller number? Just be smart with you money. It may only be about five bucks, but hey, that's five more bucks in your pocket for other things!"
2,"Love the show, but dvd is very disappointing.",I am so annoyed with these dvds. Some of the episodes won't play. They just skipped. I am a huge cosby fan. So this is very disappointing. However I received the dvd's very quickly So I was very happy about that.
5,"Good, clean TV that you don't get too much of now.","This SEASON 3 & 4 bundle of TCS does not disappoint. Hours and hours of hilarious entertainment that anyone can enjoy without running into your typical norms for the current state of TV (frank dialogue of a sexual nature, cursing, [although I heard an H-word in the episode where the kids spend the night at Sandra's apartment], etc.). And although this bundle doesn't have the terrific artwork that went into the first two seasons' sets, each disc is housed in its own slim DVD case which is a little less nerve-wracking when taking out a disc than usual. And the menus have been nicely re-designed but there is no ""PLAY ALL"" option like before and no special features. But there are subtitles now, so that's cool."
4,Fun shows to watch,These old shows are fun to watch. We enjoy watching the changes in the children as they mature.Some of the discs are a bit difficult to negotiate from one show to another.
5,Same as Purolator,"From test data I found online, it looks like these are the same as the Purolator Pure One. Since there isn't a P1 in this size, this may be the best oil filter available for this size."
1,"Excellent, but no support at all!","Personal ExperienceThe NEC LT-245 is an excellent projector. It has an excellent picture and nice features such as a quick button to set the color of the wall you are projecting onto. As a biz projector unfortunatelly doesn't have adecuate support. NEC has a backlog of more than 4000 units, no spare parts, no replacement units available. Therefore, if you depend on a projector to do business it is not a good choice.ProblemsAfter less than 40 hours of use some dark spots developed (about 1/4 from the top edge and 1/3 from the right edge). It seams that the lenses are plastic and one cracked on the edge. Simple solution: exchange the lens unit. Three weeks have passed and still waiting for a date when I will get it back."
1,"This software is so simple, focus to unexpected people","I don't recommend you to buy this software, it is bored and not is interactive, the isn't instructions, I made some examples w"
2,Probably Lustord's worst release...,"The simple fact that the words ""The Night of the Demon"" are constantly repeated throughout this release in the most unexpected places take away a lot of the magic of what would have been an otherwise great work.Funny how no other reviewer mentions it... be warned... you'll have to delete a few track to fully enjoy it, in my opinion...Buy ""Rising"" instead... with your eyes closed, but not here at that outrageous price... visit his website and you'll be amazed!"
4,Pepin High Book Review,"Eliza and her mother, Lorna, start off on a new adventure to start over from the tragic loss of Eliza's father by moving to a pink trailer in the small town of Gouge Eye, Missouri. Eliza throughout this book takes a number of tests to get herself in the ""popular"" crowd, and try's to make her ""science-book"" minded friend Deirdre understand. Even though she puts her relationships with people around her at great risks, she finally understands what real friendship is."
5,My favorite cooking book,"I bought this book when I started what I call ""my trip towards vegetarianism"". When I decided to start decreasing my intake of animal products, I decided to experiment new ways of cooking veggies: I love cooking and I enjoy eating good food, and I was not going to make my meals boring or lacking in taste because I decided to eat healthier, no way! This book shows how simple it can be to eat healthier while still enjoying your meals fully and not feeling deprived. As an Italian, I found here recipes that I absolutely love, as they use spices and tastes very familiar to me. But this book also contains recipes from Spain, Greece, France, and other Mediterranean areas. You'll fall in love with this book! Since I started preparing the dishes in this book my husband told me I didn't need to make meat for him anymore at home, as he loved my veggie dishes.Being a vegetarian/vegan has never been so easy!"
5,This is a great cookbook.,"I have been doing the Mediterranean diet for a few months, but I am allergic to dairy so it limits my choices for menu options. This book is vegan so it has some great dairy free recipes. The food is delicious and simple to make. I like that the recipes call for ingredients that I can find in my local grocery store and I don't have to track down some weird product that they only sell on the Internet. The best part is that in the back of the book they have meal plans. I am one of those people who does not know what side dish would go well with an entrée, etc. I was thrilled to see that they do this for you so I can just sit down and plan my meals for the entire week. Love, love, love this book."
4,This is a great cookbook even for non-vegans,There are so many recipes in this cookbook that everyone should be able to find favorites and 'keepers'. Even my non-vegan husband cannot tell sometimes when I cook something up from this book. I also feel like the ingredients are usually on-hand so it is not that difficult to open it up and make a meal.
4,A what?,"Great ideas. Lots of the ingredients are a little hard to find in my area and when I do find them, they're extremely expensive. If you live in a larger city or have access to specialty foods stores, you'll probably have an easier time of following the recipes exactly.I have had to make several substitutions or just leave things out with a decent success rate.I would recommend1,000 Vegetarian Recipes, in addition to this book."
5,Authentic Mediterranean flavor,"A vegan recipe book that uses real foods not fake substitutes, all of which are easily obtainable. Recipes have authentic Mediterranean flavor."
4,"At Last, a vegan mediterranean cookbook","I was extremely happy to finally find a Mediterranean cookbook that was vegan. I thought the recipes were excellent, good variety of Greek dishes, and good spicing. Since there are not many vegan Mediterranean cookbooks out there, this will build a foundation for others to come.A very good start for vegan Mediterranean cooking."
3,"Vegan, but not necessarily healthy","I bought the book with the expectation of finding recipes that might be compatible with Dr. Fuhrman's ""Eat To Live"" diet. After skimming through the book, I found that most of the recipes had 10-20 grams of fat, which is too fat much for Fuhrman, Ornish and McDougall diets. This is a lot of fat for anyone to include as a regular part of their diet.There are some low-fat dishes (<8 grams) in the book that look good. Most of the desserts are low-fat. Unfortunately, most of the desserts add significant amounts of sugar, which also pose dietary problems."
4,The Mediteranean Vegan Kitchen:,"I am a brand new vegan, and my general cooking experience is limited, but the recipes in this book are very easy to follow, and the results are delicious. We do use a lot more seasoning than is called for, but that's just a matter of taste. Nutrition info is given with each recipe for fat, protein, carbs, fiber and sodium, which helps in menu planning.I'm very glad I bought this book."
5,Not a vegan and LOVE this cookbook!,"I borrowed it so often from the library, I realized that I needed to own it. So far, every recipe I've tried has been absolutely delicious. I was especially surprised at how rich-tasting the vegetable broth recipe is--no expensive ingredients but it really adds depth to many of the other recipes. Also tried was Marinated Lentil Salad, Baked Tomatoes, Sicilian Style, and Garlic Puree with Croutons. This is becoming the cookbook I turn to first!"
5,Vegan Made Easy and Delicious,"Most of the recipes are easy and reasonably quick. The ingredients are usually ones you can find in a normal grocery store -- even in the Midwest. And all I've tried so far have been tasty. Because the recipes were designed without dairy, they don't feel like poor substitutes for something that should have had dairy; they just taste like something you'd want to eat."
3,Many recipes a stretch for some,"This cookbook is full of flavorful recipes, but:As a warning to some, it relies on several ingredients that may be found only in jars, cans or at a relatively high price in most areas of the US, and cannot, due to weather requirements, be easily grown at home. These include mushrooms, pearl onions and good quality olives.If you have a functioning smoke alarm in your kitchen you may be reluctant to try the roasted vegetables used in many recipes.Health-wise, despite the book's health emphasis, there is no mention of calcium or what to focus on to get it, though anchovies and dairy are omitted entirely. There is also liberal use of white bread, refined rice, flour and pasta - just two recipes use wheat berries, and one uses whole wheat pita bread made with 3 parts white flour."
3,so so cookbook,"I tried a few of the recipes, some were good, some weren't. There are no pictures to inspire you to try the recipes."
5,Delightful!,There are so many great recipes...I am just getting started. Mediterranean and Vegan says it all!
1,Not good for heart disease,"The recipes in this book are good for vegetarians/vegans without heart disease. However, almost every single recipe uses olive oil which should not be consumed by persons with heart disease. I was hopeful this recipe book would be the one but was terribly disappointed."
1,Useless Product,"In spite of the picture showing the use of this gadget bought from Amazon, it is impossible to attach it to any wheel on my Invacare walker."
1,foundations of nursing,I ordered this book at the beginning of the year and i still have not gotten it yet. This is the first time anything like this has ever happen with an amazon product. I have ordered a lot of products off of amazon and this is the worst thing that could have happen.
4,Weak holding force,"This velcro holds less strongly than other tapes I've used, and seems to grow weaker with repeated openings and closings. Depending upon your application, this may or may not be of importance to you."
2,Not very good,The hook and loops aren't strong. Comes apart too easily. Many hooks break off and makes a mess. My last roll(don't know brand) had very few that broke. Won't buy again.
2,Very cheaply made,These straps are flimsy and break easily. There is quite a few on the roll but plastic cable ties are a better choice for holding power.
4,What I needed,"It is what it says on the box and it does the job just fine. Probably just what most want/expect. My only regret is that I bought a roll somewhere else some time ago and it was just very, well ""low profile"" is the best I can think to describe it, small but powerful hooks and tight knit loop side, very slick, just can't seem to find it again though. This is perfectly good though."
1,Terrible Product,The tape I received is just one sided all loop no hooks. The only way it will hold anything is if you tie it in a knot.
1,"Only has one side - just the soft mesh, not the ""hooks""","Based on the strong reviews (and the complete lack of information) I assumed it had both sides of the velcro equation - it does not. Unless you have another roll that has the ""hook"" side, this is a complete waste of money."
1,Did Not Stick,"The back (""loop"") side was defective - ""loops"" would not catch - they were too tight/low. Operated like it was one sided. Returned for refund. The Amazon return process seemed easy and user friendly."
3,great to have around for the money!,"I bought this to really just keep around the house......so far I have used it for strapping down PC cables to keep them organized, but can think of many more types of use. It's cheap, i would recommend to have a roll in your utility drawer."
1,yucky,Only sticks to my socks. Horrible product. I won't use them again. I think I already gave a review. Tadaa
5,Good review,Good product - good price! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaa aaaa aaa aaaa aaa aaa a
1,BEWARE - NOT AS DESCRIBED,"If you're looking for a double-sided roll of velcro like I was-BEWARE! As others have described in the reviews of this product, the unit I received was FUZZY-SIDE ONLY; i.e., it was completely useless as a cable tie. Consider purchasing another similar item to save yourself the time and trouble of having to return this item for a refund."
1,Not as advertised,"Like some others who've given 1 star reviews, I just received an order of this (July 24, 2012) that has only the fuzzy side. The back side is flat, so it won't adhere to itself. Not what's advertised, not what I ordered. It's a hassle to send it back, so I'll find other uses for it, but if you want a cable tie product that has BOTH hook and loop on one strip, front and back, so that it will adhere to itself, this is NOT the product to order."
1,Completely useless,"Received only the soft side of velcro, not cable ties as advertised. Will hopefully be able to find some cable tie that is actually cable tie to replace it."
1,useless -- does not stick,"The only thing that sticks is a piece of velcro used to keep the roll from unravelling. If it were any good, it would stick to itself! Sold by CenturyLink not Cblwhl as advertised. A total gip."
1,Must have a bad lot,"I just received an order of this (July 19, 2012) that has only the fuzzy side. The back side is flat, so it won't adhere to itself. I assume I got a bad lot since there are so many good reviews. Anyway I am returning it to Amazon (CenturyTech was the seller in this case, fulfilled by Amazon)."
4,Works okay. Not real Velcro,"As others have stated this is not real ""Velcro"" it is a generic hook and loop product. It works okay, but the grip is not as strong as other hook and loop products I've used. Because of the weaker grip you need to overlap a little more than you would with some other products.Overall for the price it works okay."
4,Not bad,"The Velcro Cable tie Roll does its' job and can easily be cut and can make cable management easy. The velcro is not exactly that strong, so if you're going to use this for something -- don't expect it to endure heavy things. Just like with most velcros, it starts to deteriorate with much use that it might not be stick hard enough more. That being said, I have no qualms or regrets and will surely buy it again if need be."
3,Get what you pay for,"I got three rolls of this stuff and have gone through the first roll so far. Like some other people said it's not the highest quality hook & loop by far. It is a bit stiff, and yes when cutting it is quite messy. It does, however, get the job done. Like the review says, you get what you pay for."
3,Basic hook and loop roll,"Ordered this product but I thought I was ordering a continous roll of hook and loop that was sectioned in around 10 in sections. This is a continous roll of loop on the top and hook on the bottom. The quality of hook and loop is just average. It holds together well enough as not to come apart from itself. This product is not designed to hold difficult to secure loads such as heavy extension cords, only smaller loads such as computer cables. It does not have any way to keep it attached to a computer cable or power cord when not in use; you'll have to figure that out on your own. Overall, a good product, but could be manufactured with more quality control with a heavier load bearing capacity."
4,Very Useful Stuff - Recommeded,"This Velcro Cable Tie Roll is incredibly handy to have around. This is two sided, with ""hooks"" on one side and ""loops"" on the other that can be cut to the need length, but be sure to leave enough overlap to ensure the Velcro will adhere to itself.This stuff literally has dozens of uses, and finding more all the time, but it isn't the strongest gripping Velcro I have owned so wouldn't trust it to hold a lot of weight or to secure fragile items.Recommended!CFH"
3,Just adequate,"Being IT professional, I have used rolls of velcro a lot. This particular product suffers from being a little cheap. It can certainly do the job but it has two main issues. First, it does not hold very well which forces you to use more tha you normally would have to in order to get more overlap so it does not open up. This also causes the edge to lift up and catch on things. The other problem is that when you cut it it starts to fall apart at the edge. The small plastic velcro ""J"" hooks fall off everywhere and make a mess. Not a huge deal but something I have not seen with other products.Overall, this product works okay, there is just higer quality ones out there."
2,This IS NOT VELCRO-- TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT,"This IS NOT VELCRO. I really wanted the Velcro quality, which this falls short. The edge has little pieces that constantly fall off. The hook side of it is very loose, no where as tight as Velcro. The loop side seems less dense as well. The end result is that it will hold, but it takes a much larger piece, and it sheds black fragments constantly. I would not buy it again. It was not worth the few cents saved."
1,Check this product the moment you receive it!,"The product I received is NOT double sided Velcro -- it's merely ""loops"" on one side and backing strip on the other side. It does NOT attach to itself at all. Not in the slightest. Therefore, by itself, this product is totally useless other than as a monument to my stupidity in not checking that it really was double-sided the moment that I got it -- and, now, of course, it's too late to return."
4,Handy stuff,Work with needy kids in fishing program & lines always came loose when transporting rods. I use short piece of this to wrap around rod & hold line/hook in place. works great!!
5,a lot of velcro,"I bought this to consolidate cable bundles on my desk. I have enough velcro now to do my whole house and attach my kids and pets to the wall. I don't think I'll ever buy velcro again. Anyway, this did the job i was looking for. I bundled computer and entertainment center cables together and everything is tidy now. It seems to help with the dust bunnies as well."
4,Did its job perfectly,I bought this for the drum and bugle corps I work for so the front ensemble can organize their audio cables. They never reported any problems and I never had to buy more.
5,Very strong,"This velcro holds together very well, Didn't come apart after I wrapped up all my cables when moving the cables around."
5,Great Stuff,"Its about as useful as duct tape. awesome to have around. I use it to hold tools, lights and gear to my rode bike."
4,Velcro,This product was fine. It helped me be more organized. The product came in a good rate of shipping date. I would give this product a 4.
3,"Mm... ok, I guess","Does what you expect it to do, I suppose, but it's not the best quality velcro out there. It's a little flimsy and not as heavy duty as I had hoped."
1,Really Bad,I was trying to use this velcro with a sewing machine. Forget it! There are glue inside. Once I started sewing with the sewing machine. The glue came off and sticked onto the needle. That makes it impossible for me to use it at all.
4,Good enough...,"The tape velcro is ok for organizing wires, but if you are going to use this product for strapping purposes, a couple layers of the stuff is needed, but it works nevertheless...good price for the product."
5,Exactly what I needed.,I needed to substitute for a broken strap on my walking golf cart. It was perfect. Then I have 3 yards for other uses around the house.
5,The Real Muslim World,"Real tales and anecdotes of real Muslims. If you still believe Islam is a religion of peace, read this. Islamic Fundamentalism is the wave of the future in Europe and the US."
1,bigoted propaganda,"Nothing but bigoted propaganda. For example, it ignores the fact that the US sponsored and supported islamic extremism and provided it with ammunition against moderate islamists in order to fit its imperialist agenda of military control of strategic locations in the middle east and south africa. It also ignores US atrocities in iraq and palestine that fuel such extremism and radicalizes islamists. The book lays all the blame on islamists while making america look like an ""innocent victim""."
3,Women as 2nd class citizen's - but getting better...,"It is the culture and the law of Saudi Arabia. Of course, all rooted in the religion of Islam. Hard to believe educated, obviously intelligent women would not only accept this culture, but in some instances, applaud it. Good to see that change - for the better - is occurring. Slowly, but surely."
4,"Great, BUT","I loved this video when it first came out on VHS video tape and I waited a long time for it to come out on DVD. Sadly I am disappointed.The video content on the DVD is the same but the video itself is not up to DVD quality. The DVD looks like it was copied from the VHS video tape. Some of the video has color shifting and there is a line at the bottom of the video. Some of the scenes seem to be less bright and the video is slightly grainy. The VHS tape appears to have better quality. I am keeping the DVD version however since it's more convenient. I will live with it.When HGTV was showing gardening shows, it was so much easier to find good garden videos. Now they're hard to find and many only exist in the original VHS format. I wish there were good Blu-ray garden videos, maybe someday."

5,Night Calls,"A really good read. The mix of magic, fantasy, history and herbology kept me interested throughout. The tone and language of the book makes it readible for kid or kidult alike.I hope she is writing a sequal."
5,Night Calls - an awesome exploration of dark possibilities.,"Night Calls pulled me into the story almost immediately, andwas a gripping experience through to the end. I hope therewill be more opportunities to find out what happens in theworld Ms. Kimbriel has created.The werewolf comes to the village, and causes terror. Ayoung family must make difficult choices between personaland community welfare. The terror of werewolves, vampiresand other supernatural forces of evil are balanced by forcesof light, and choices lead on into further challenges thatpull the reader along. The phenomena are described simplyand believably, a part of daily life, chillingly real. Thepull between good and evil is not delivered as a sermon, andeach choice matters to the reader as the story progresses.I found the book fascinating, as did my elder son, a fantasyaddict. The twelve-year old found it a little too frightening,but plans to return to it some time when he is older."
3,Spooky but a tad too slow moving,"Night Calls is a spooky, atmospheric tale about a young girl coming of age amongst werewolves, vampires and other assorted supernatural frights. The story begins when werewolves invade the young heroine's life and she learns that she has a ""gift"" for dealing with these beings. She begins a quest to learn all that she can to save those she loves from the creatures of the night.Written in a low key style with muted violence Night Calls is a good choice for younger readers and for those who don't enjoy in-your-face violence. The pace was a bit too slow for my tastes, and all too often I found my eyes glazing over when the minuet details of the heroine's life got out of control. Still, it was a sufficiently eerie story written with emotion and I immediately liked the spunky and outspoken heroine."
5,One of the best collections of aphorisms there is,"The aphorisms collected and edited here by Auden and Kronenberger are drawn from more than four hundred of the West's major authors. The book is organized in chapters, ""Humanity "" ""Religion and God"" ""Nature"""" Education"""" Society"" ""The Sexes"" ""Love, Marriage and Friendship"" The Professions"" ""History "" "" Action"" ""Science"" "" The Arts"" ""States and Government"" "" The Life of the Mind"" "" Life's Minor Pleasures and Trials"" "" Ages of Man""It seems almost superflous to give good examples , since every page of the work is rich with them. Who loves aphorisms will love this work."
5,Triump of the human spirit!,Tells the struggles of slavery in a realistic & compassionate way. Loves the author's style of writing--feel it was very well written.
5,Joe from Spring Hill Florida,Not only is the CD great if you get the DVD you can see two the compositions perfomed to see the intensity of the performers including Pharoah blowing so hard saliva comes out the horn.
5,Pharoah Sanders Gets Down,"I've heard Pharoah Sanders live several times, and recently had this CD autographed. This performance is about 30 years old, but still sounds fresh. Sanders really cuts loose here, showing the influence of John Coltrane. He has a very strong crew of supporting players, particularly Idris Muhammed on drums. If you like high-energy modern jazz, then this is for you."
5,Very pleased,"I received this ring as a wedding band. It is just as beautiful as the image and is very comfortable.It was only available in a larger size than I wear and I have not yet had it sized, so I'm not sure if it canbe sized without compromising the design. I love this band and I'm glad my husband took my suggestion.It's unusual enough that I don't see it on anyone else."
5,What a great entertainer!,All of Bobby's best are here. I had forgotten what an entertainer he is. Fidelity is excellent. If you are only going to have one CD set of his music you won't go wrong with this one.
5,great book for the confused,"This is an awesome book for those who are troubled or confused about the justice, mercy, love and ""hate"" of God. It also explains passages such as God ""desiring all men to be saved"" or how can God hate others under reprobation. This is, ironically, one of the best defenses of the Reformed or Calvinist faith. Sproul is such and outstanding teacher, and he explains these difficult concepts using the historical church as well as a careful examination of Scripture to back his claims. This book sinks into your pysche, and after reading it, you will think of the contents well after this book goes paperback. Does Sproul speak infallibly ex cathedra on matters of faith? Sometimes i am convinced he does. Easy to understand, this book is a winner for layman, students, and clergy."
4,Greatness in footwear,"I finally found some footwear that eases the pain of standing for hours on end on concrete floors when you have high arches and can't find shoes that work for your feet. They make for interesting conversation at work though people are always asking me where I got them and if they are comfortable... honestly would I continue to wear them if they weren't?My only issue is that the traction ribs on them are already starting to break down after only 3 months... I'm holding out hope that they will still be wearable when they've warn down completely but I'll just have to start saving up for another pair.Just add a simple set of flat insoles, its easy to cut them to size just trace the bottom of the boot and make sure the cut for the toe is long enough, and you're good to go."
5,Best Tabi I have found,I am a martial artist and a producer of a troupe of Acrobats that use these for their costume. Jika Tabi are the most durable and the most comfortable that I have found.Tip:Just don't buy them too big or the bottom 2 tabs don't stay fastened. Still it is not a big problem.
5,jika tabi were great,"These jika tabi were exactly as advertised, arrived new in box very quickly. When you measure your foot, believe the measurement you get. I ordered a little big and they are a little big! Still quite comfortable to wear, though."
1,Sloppy and error filled book.,Asian Cult Cinema is a bad book. The reviews are flawed and the information is either flat out wrong or badly researched. The movie synopises are down right absmaland headache inducing. I bought a copy of this book back in 1997. After reading it and doing my own research I sent the writer a huge list of corrections. I recieved a postcard with a note of acknowledgement. A few years later it was reprinted with the same errors.Instead of buying this book go out and get a copy of Hong Kong Babylon. At least the writers went out and did their homework and put some time and effort into it. A.C.C. is flat out aweful. I would avoid it like the plague. Even the pictures are mislabeled. At his website he charges high prices for videos that are availible elsewhere. You even have to be a member just to purchase these videos. For shame.Don't even think about it!
1,Full of errors,"All of the other reviews have it right -- the book is full of errors, making it very unreliable as an information source. The opinions expressed in Asian Cult Cinema are also, shall we say, eccentric -- check out the review of Woo's Hard Boiled as an example of what I mean. Plus many important movies aren't included, for no reason I can discern (where's Magnificent Warriors, for example?) I did like the first appendix, which summarizes older martial arts movies in a quick, useful way. But you can probably get that kind of information elsewhere. Avoid."
1,An Affront To HK Cinema - Buyer Beware!,"I did not find this book to be particularly useful. While the author claims to be a fan of this style of moviemaking, from what I've read in this book, he appears to be an American making fun of the Chinese people. Chinese men are continually portrayed as violent or foolish and Chinese women as beautiful objects. There is not much useful information to be found here and definitely not much information to be found about movies made prior to the 80s. I am really sorry that I ever bought this book. It is an insult to Hong Kong cinema and particularly insulting to Chinese people everywhere."
1,This book is AWFUL!,"Asian Cult Cinema is a font of factual misinformation. Every word Weisser writes is a lie, including ""and"" ""but"" and ""the."" Almost all of his plot synopses, dates, and casting information are incorrect in some way. Plus, he seems to value gratuitous nudity and maggot scenes more than good photography, acting, or plot. He is so unfair to certain HK actors (especially the great Stephen Chow) that I wonder if he even watched their movies. He gives Chu Yen Ping's GOLDEN QUEEN COMMANDOS an incredible four stars even though it could have been made by Ed Wood. You will not learn ANYTHING from this book!"
2,Not recommended.,"I would not recommend this book to someone looking for a balanced introductory guide to Hong Kong films. For one, there are a lot of factual errors. Titles, release years, stars, and plots are often mixed up and inaccurate. The author also seems to have a ""more exploitative & trashy, the better"" attitude--so maybe if your idea of an excellent film is the kind that would be perfect on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", you would like this book. Lots of great films are omitted, and his personal bias against some stars (like Chow Sing Chi) totally color his reviews. Don't get this one unless you're a completist for volumes on HK cinema and already have much better books like ""Hollywood East""."
1,Bitter Disappointment,This is a horrible book. This author is not objective at all and does not have his facts straight. What is the matter with this guy?
4,a good beginner's book on free brush painting,"This book could be a good beginner's text for self-teaching on traditional East Asian brush painting popular in China, Korea, and Japan. This book comprises 22 lessons, starting from calligraphy of Chinese characters to a complete landscape with people and animals, with reasonable instructions and beautiful paintings as examples. However, this book emphasizes ""xieyi"" (free brush painting) rather than ""gongbi"" (fine brush painting). To those who prefer ""gongbi"" (as I do), it is somewhat disappointing."
5,Breathtaking survey of modern contempary work,"This book is exceptional! Not only does it provide a excellent overview of traditional oriental techniques, but shows modern interpretations, by several top contempoary Asian artists. The work of the two authors is simply breathtaking. It is beautifully produced, and offers a visual feast. There are many books which show how to hold an oriental brush - this book invites readers to apply traditional techniques as tools of expression. It is one of my favouite all time books and and I find something new and fresh each time I look at it."
2,Re writing,"It was OK. Not as informative as I hoped. Too much joking, no examples, and her wardrobe was a weird choice. I can see why the Writer Store stopped carrying the DVD."
2,I wish I had not bought it.,"This book may be helpful to anyone who is never published or who does not have a journalism degree. Burgett answered a few questions I had, but the book seem to go over the fundamentals of getting published more so than how ""sell & resell you magazine articles."" I wish I had not bought it."

4,Sam..........we miss you.....Part 2,"Once again...........Sam was perhaps the funniest, most striking comedic character of the past fifty years. His comedy was timely, visceral and most importantly, very human. Most of what parades about today as ""humor"" is boring, sophomoric and generally very predictable. Sam wasn't boring, wasn't sophomoric and early on wasn't very predictable."
1,"""Wish I Could Give This a Big 0",We though Sam was funny when he first began his career. But these are NOT funny. Just hate against everyone and everything. The first disc was terrible but we thought maybe the second would be better but it was worse! We threw both in the trash. What a waste of money!
2,Wild Child Redundancy,"I love Kinison, but only glimpses of his brilliance are afforded in this 2-CD set. This is mostly latter career big stage rock and roll and cursing crudeness, not the dazzling originality and brilliance he exhibited early on in clubs. There is far too much of same material, different day here as well, with many versions of the same (and certainly not his funniest) routines over and over again."
3,Sam,ALthough there were many sessions all pretty much had the same jokes .He is funny but can be a little gross
3,Classic Comedy,"I remember when Sam Kinison first became one of the most popular comics around during the 80s. His comedy was funny at first, but over time he seemed to buy into his own hype and somewhat lost his way. Too bad he died in such a senseless way."

1,"RCA 52"" a lemon","I bought the RCA HD 52"" on December 31 2005 and have had limited use of the TV in the past year. The model # is HD52W59YX36. After a few weeks of use the screen would scroll up slowly creating a split screen view. It would shut down after 30 minutes and would not turn on again. Once the set cooled, the TV would be operational for another 30 minutes and repeat the process. I could not get thru to RCA technical support on the phone. I went back to Walmart where I bought the set and they gave me the local repair shop. A technician came out and had to order a part. It has been on back order for 8 months and RCA has no idea when it will be available. Now the unit will not turn on. Its been a complete disaster and I am looking to cut my losses and file a complaint with the state of Florida. I will never buy a RCA branded product again."
5,Tearful tale,"Many parts of this movie moved too slowly, which was a shame because it was a great idea. In my opinion, a scene with the lawyer where she does some explaining shouldn't have been cut. It just seemed far too awkward that it didn't show the main character having to give an explanation about the death. However, I did love the story and the relationship that developed between Toni Collette's character and Gotaro Tsunashima. Any film that can clean out the 'ole tearducts can't be completely bad. I will say that if there's an award out there for the longest funeral scene, this movie should win. But please don't let the sluggish pace of some areas of the film deter you from watching it. This is a tale with a lot of heart. Also, if you love looking at different places in Australia, there are many glimpses of the vast and mysterious landscape.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,"At times like this, I say I'm not Australian","Yes, Toni Collette did a good job but everything else was crap, including her character. I can see why overseas people might appreciate this more than Australians. Toni's character was like a female Steve Erwin(is that his name?). Anyway, there really really is not storyline and the 'event' is too abrupt and quite pointless really. As for the love in this movie...what love? The Japanese buisness man clearly did not love his wife and the relationship he had with Toni Collette was one of those experiments that Japanese people do with blue eyed, blond haired westerners. It's pure curiosity because Japanese people hardly bread out of their own culture unless they move coutry permanently (I'm one of those 'few'). He never actually loved her and nore would he even consider leaving his wife for her. All the movie shows in a generalised Japanese man versus a very generalised Australain woman."
1,"Absolute, pure, pointless DRIVEL..... Simply embarrassing.","I will keep this short and sweet: in my opinion, a movie should contain some sort of plot, some character development, and a believable storyline which allows the viewer to empathize with the characters. Japanese Story contains NONE of the above. It has taken the Australian film industry back 50 years. What a shame. Simply laughable. A joke. A waste. Painful."
4,Pretty good...,"One reason to see this movie...Toni Collette. She's such a good character actress...from her earlier work in Clockwatchers to About a Boy. She delivers one of her best roles here. She plays a woman who finds love when she least expects it, with someone she least expects to find it with. The character drama is great. Their relationship quietly builds as they begin to see into the other one's lives and culture a little more. Since these two take up a majority of screen time their performances must be good and they do not disappoint. The twist in the movie is unexpected and kind of slows the movie down, although all is resolved in the end. Toni Collete's performance is touching and the romance between the two characters is moving. Check it out...even if you don't like the movie as a whole you will be impressed with Collete's performance and her abilities as a great character actress."
3,"Good acting, lovely scenery","The story isn't original: two people from different backgrounds have a brief and tragic romance. But it has great acting and lovely Australian scenery. Good, but not great movie."
2,A drab boring film,"In this film that wants to pretend to greatness through its use of an excellent soundtrack, decent outfits and brilliant cinematography the story however goes to the dogs. It is stereotypical ""I want to make a foreing film that people will think is poignant"" therefore it has a 'foreigner' and a 'european' who must fall in love without emotions in order to be 'multi-cultural'. Unfortunatly it is just not a good film, it has no logic to it and the plot is drab. If it had in fact had no dialouge then it might have worked better and if no one had pretended it was a 'love story' instead the viewer is forced to wit through endless sadness and useless illogical love scenes that are neither realistic or helpful.Basicaly a bad film that is couched in stereotype, like 'American Beauty' to make us 'think' when there is nothing to think about. Kudos to the music score and camera work.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Unusual and absorbing,"This offbeat tale of two lonely individuals who connect during a road trip through the Australian desert is bizarre yet surprisingly credible. Toni Colette is charming and completely believable as an independent, no-nonsense Australian geologist. In a refreshing twist, the actor who plays her Japanese businessman lover is the physically beautiful one of the pair, and the camera makes the most of his physical attributes. The story unfolds with subtlety and humor, yet is ultimately shocking. Without giving too much away, I can only say that there is an abrupt shift in plot and mood that occurs midway through the story, and that despite some continuity of sub-themes, this divides the film drastically into two segments. Certainly life can and does take these unexpected directions, yet the sudden transition (particularly in a story this narrow in scope) feels a touch contrived. A very satisfying and visually stunning film nonetheless."
2,Dreadfully slow,"This is tedious from the start, as we are forced to endure extended scenes of a Japanese businessman trying to speak English, not very amusingly. After he and Collette have a low-voltage romance, he dies. The movie then stops dead and turns into something else, very uninteresting. A very slow two hours that doesn't really tell us much. Collette's acting is the centerpiece. If you like her, then you'll want to watch. Just don't expect to be entertained."
2,Collette's good but that's about it.,"The only reason I bought this movie is because Toni Collette is in it and I am a big fan of hers. Plus the movie got good reviews so I figured it couldn't miss. I was wrong. This film is very boring and very slow and from what I can tell relies on one shocking unexpected moment and some good acting from Collette to make it a good movie. It's not nearly enough. Collette is good but it is not her best work. The japanese leading mans performance is average at best. I don't want to give away what happens but I didn't really believe the level of the 2 main characters relationship warrented the reaction we got.Some good points about the film are Collette, one very enexpexted scene that took me very much by surprise, and the fact that we get to see Collette naked! And yes she looks good.So if you're a big Collette fan like me you might want to see this but I wouldn't expect much. Collettes best work that I've seen is ""The Night Listener""."
5,amazing,"I am a fan of Loeb and Sale, I think everything they do together is extremely outstanding, Daredevil yellow is not the exception of that. This book re-tells some of the early days of DD, fills in some gaps from the frank miller era and flawlessly keeps up with the continuity of kevin smith's short but memorable run. Yellow is a fantastic bomb of nostalgia beatifully delivered the way only loeb and sale could do it, in my opinion, this is some of their best work as a team, second only to batman's the long halloween. Beatiful art, excellent characterization, great story overall. If you are a fan of DD or comics in general you need to look into DD Yellow ASAP."
4,Loeb/Sale deliver another classic retelling!!,"This is another of the color-themed named series by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale and this one, like the others is worth reading and rereading! Sale's art has the perfect retro look that makes these classics shine. Loeb's dialogue here is spot on and pretty fun. The insight into Matt Murdock's life through a few different stages is pretty awesome. Overall, this is a really fun read!"
4,Loeb & Sale re-tell Daredevil,"Daredevil: Yellow is a sort of re-telling of the origins of the blind superhero, with longtime partners Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale in the driver's seat. Ignoring the gritty re-telling of Frank Miller with The Man Without Fear, Yellow is instead a poignant tale in which Matt Murdock reminisces of the lost love that was Karen Page. It also gives a further detail into the changing of the Daredevil costume from the original yellow to the beloved red one we all know today. While Loeb's touching story is a nice surprise given the ultra gritty track record of the character, cynical readers of Yellow will probably dismiss it as a whole. That aside, Loeb spins a good and heart filled yarn, while Tim Sale provides his usual beautiful artwork. In terms of origin stories, I still prefer Miller's, as many do, but Yellow is a welcome change of pace regardless, and definitely worth adding to your Daredevil collection whether your a fan of the character or the works of Loeb and Sale."
1,Not the item pictured.,"First off, this seller has a lot of gall to put a photo of the glasses that does not match the actual item delivered (whether or not either set of glasses resemble the one Agent Smith wore is another issue).Now, I was not expecting a high quality replica, it's twenty bucks, but I at least wanted to receive the item depicted on the sales listing.Noticeable differences:1)the nose piece looks very different, and is not attached to the glases frames/lenses by brackets, as depicted.2)The glasses are cheaply and shoddily mirrored, rather than being tinted dark, as depicted.3)the ear pieces are rounded, not squared off.4)the frame is thinner than depicted, particularly in the ear piece area.5)the ear pieces do not attach to the lenses in the manner shown in the photograph, rather, there is a single cheap looking bracket.All in all, the glasses bear a resemblance to the photo, but are NOT THE SAME."
1,non,I had used this patch in the past. I ordered online because I could not find it in local hardware stores. The adhesiveness of the patches was no better than that of a bandage. They would not stick to the gutter surface. Will not buy
1,For novice only,I bought this book to have a consolidated view of business on the internet. What I got was a version that talked about what an internet is and advised me to buy a 486 computer ( I cant even find one in Silicon Valley). I think this book is for people who dont know anything about computers or the internet. What I did with my book? returned it !
1,Big Disapointment,"I thought this book would be much better considering that the guy who wrote it is on tv all the time. I knew within the first 10 minutes of reading it that I was going to return it. The published date on it says 2000, but this cannot be correct. It recommends buying a 486 computer, or if you require a faster computer to buy a P75. Everything else in the book was out of date too, and wasn't really helpful at all for anything."
5,Sammys best yet,"this is sammys best album yet. i am a big fan of his.not a song on this one that i dont like. gone for good goodbye sounds so emotional.paper heart is adoreable.beer,bait & ammo is for all those good ole boys,so rural. if you buy this one i know you wont want your money back. you did it this time sammy, your very best ever. thank you."
3,SAM's the GREATEST!!,Just when you think SAM can't get any better..he does!! Great to hear new music from THE MAN.. He is the best. New CD is FANTASTIC!!!#1 Pennsylvania Fan
2,I want my money back,"I want my money back is a fitting name for this album. This is not the quality of previouse albums such as Haunted Heart, Politics Religion and Her & Labor of love. Up to this point I would have not thought it was possible for Sammy Kershaw to have a [bad] CD but I guess the title should have been a hint."
2,I want my money back,"I want my money back is a fitting name for this album. This is not the quality of previouse albums such as Haunted Heart, Politics Religion and Her & Labor of love. Up to this point I would have not thought it was possible for Sammy Kershaw to have a ""bad"" CD but I guess the title should have been a hint."
4,A good math book....,This book provides a good selection of quizes and drills. It also has a useful glossary. Use Math Smart Junior together with Algebra the Easy Way. The explanations in Alegebra the Easy Way are better than in Math Smart Junior.
3,Great addition to my authentic cookbook collection,"As a fellow American of Calabrese descent, I enjoy very much perusing Ken Borelli's collection of recipes and insight into southern Italian traditions."
4,Oldies but goodies...,Good quality CD at a discount price with plenty of great classic country music to take you back to a by-gone era.
3,"It's a bag right? Tote, not so much.","So the measurements are right. The color is right. And the warning tag that states, ""The State of California requires the following statement. WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm"" is right too I guess. Besides the fact that the width is narrow, I won't be using it for much because you cannot carry it on your shoulder and it's not too sturdy due to the short/weak straps. Maybe I'll turn it into an arts and crafts project."
1,It can't tell time!,"The clock can not tell the correct time. The arrows will be placed at 3:05 for example and then the thing announces it it 3:40. It does this consistently no matter what mode it is in ""Quiz Qame"" or ""Tell Time"". We put fresh batteries in it and it still has never been correct once. The thing is a joke!"
4,Great Cologne,"Lets start off by saying that I'm 17, in high school and currently single. So I would recommended this to appeal to the ladies. Now, I didn't buy it here, my sister bought this for me for Christmas. I wear it almost daily because its the only ""nice"" Cologne I have. It smells sort of fruity, sweet, and it gets a bit strong if you wear over 2/3 sprays. Very nice though, I received compliments from girls at school allot, one likes to hug me just to smell it. But its a good Cologne, if your new to Cologne, I'd be cautious with this because too much can make you nauseous as well as those around you. But great cologne"
5,"Great Product, save a few $","i could've bought this in the store but would paid a few bucks more, and this was brand new so why not save a few. Smells great!"
3,Am I the only one who thinks this smells just like Polo Sport?,"I used to rock Polo Sport back in the day and Very Sexy smells awfully like Ralf Lauren's signature sport cologne. I like Very Sexy about as much as I liked Polo Sport, hence the 3 stars. It provides a decent value for the price."
5,Very funny writing. Hysterical cartoons - best I've seen!,"This is a great book! Anyone who has ever been (or is thinking about becoming) preganant should own this book! Even dads will love it! Furthermore, any publishers who like the illustrative style of this book's cartoons should get in touch with the artist for freelance work -- he's a very hard worker and has a true knack for capturing funny situations in a very creative way."
5,new age is a occult,new age is occult I Give this Book 5 star Good book truth about this dangerous occult movement Like this book fantastic is very interesting to read
4,Good workout suggestions.,"Dr Colker gives some valuable workout tips in this book. Well worth the price for that. I felt it was a little light on nutrition specifics, but that may be because he has covered that in detail in other writings."
5,Easy Bodybuilding Read,"Learn everything you need to know about bodybuilding, right down to information about the latest supplements on the market."
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"The advice on nutrition and supplementation is not bad. The section on training is a huge disappointment. For example, when discussing back training he recommends pullups. I agree on this, however he failed to mention one of the other best back builders. The DEADLIFT. There are numerous exercises that he failed to mention that are highly recommended, e.g. Dips, Front Squats and Skull crushers. Weight training is not rocket science, it's quite simple. Therefore I recommend the following book, Beyond Brawn by Stuart McRobert. He offers sound advice on training and nutrition."
1,Are you kidding me?,"There is hardly anything new in this book, it did not live up to the hype at all. I was greatly dissapointed with it. I can honestly say I did not learn one new thing. And where are all those great stories about the champs that this book was supposed to be full of? I can tell you what this book is full of, and it's not anything good! Don't waste your money on this waste of good paper."
4,EXTREME MUSCLE ENHANCEMENT-A GOOD BOOK,"HELLO,THIS IS A REALLY GREAT BOOK. FOR ANYONE OLD OR YOUNG THAT IS TRYING TO BULK UP AND HAS THE WILL POWER TO DO SO, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT FOR A LONG TIME AND EVER SINCE I STARTED READING THIS BOOK IVE BEEN SEEING BETTER AND BETTER RESULTS. HOWEVER, I DO THINK THIS BOOK COULD HAVE USE A BIT OF ILLUSTRATIONS WHEN TRYING TO DESCRIBE A WORK OUT ROUTINE. SOME OF THE ROUTINES IN THIS BOOK ARE HARD TO VISUALIZE. BUT ITS STILL A FANTASTIC BOOK."
5,Great Work,"I never felt the need to write a review on any book I read before, but this one deserves it. I applied all of Dr Coker's philosophies and me and my son have gotten truly remarkable results. The other reveiws that stated that this book was ""right to the point"" is right on the money. No overcomplicating things...just well researched and applicable information on how to build muscle."
3,Disappointment,The section on training is a huge disappointment. I expected so much more!It's alot of hype but you could learn more just surfing the net or reading FLEX mag.Buy anything by Lee Labrada and skip this book!
1,ok book bogus reviews,"Gee i wonder if these guys thought anyone would fig them out.. check out the reviews of people that ""reviewed"" this book. Suprise the overwheming bulk of them have only one review.. this book...I wonder if Colker wrote all of them himself or had his friends do it.. DO NOT BE DUPPED.this book is ok at best.. nothing i mean nothing you cant get on the net for free."
4,Worth the read,This book book addresses all the crucial points to consider in building muscle. I followed the philosophy of the author and found it to be quite effective.
2,UGGHH,"i just received the M and i cant even get the ball off to put it on. it is super tight, and i am scared to keep trying because i feel it will break. what a waste of money."
2,Tarnishing M belly ring,I thought the M was great until it start to tarnish and turn color. It was very disappointing.
2,ANOTHER compilation?,"What is the reasoning driving these endless reissues? Surely the record company would maximise profits by promoting the recently released - and far superior - Definitive Collection. On & On is a seemingly random collection of songs from ABBA's 10-year recording history, and as such is an odd listening experience: imagine a 12 track compilation of Beatles songs from their entire history and you'll appreciate how stylistically lumpy the result. Just fork out the extra for the Definitive Collection and get a great encapsulation of ABBA's fabulosity."
1,Poor quality control,"I was very excited about this bit set, especially the reversible glue joint bit. However, I have found this bit is not cut properly and the ""tongue"" it produces is too large for the ""groove"", making joining boards impossible. I am hopeful this is a fluke and the company can replace it with a bit that actually works. I will be able to test the customer service quality of the manufacturer that the previous reviewer says is so great. He sounds like he works for the company to me...."
4,Good Scott vehicle...,"RETURN OF THE BADMEN is in reality a sequel that RKO released after Randy Scott's success in BADMEN'S TERRITORY and TRAIL STREET. It's full of solid action, good acting, and the special touches that ""Gabby"" Hayes always adds to his roles. TCM occasionally runs this film. Recommended."
3,Could be better.,"This is perhaps the worst New X-Men TPB of the lot, possibly because the stories in collection are rather slow-paced, and littered with poor artwork from Igor Kordey. I don't know why he has to draw everyone with wrinkles all over - Xavier, Emma Frost, Jean Grey... none escaped. Nevertheless the standard set by New X-Men is maintained. It's also nice to see cameos from X-Men who are not the main characters this series, like Archangel, Storm, etc. Also included appearances from younger X-Men like Siryn, Multipe Man, etc. Overall an acceptable read. Get it to complete your collection."
4,A Good Read,"This collects issues #127-133.I read this in one sitting. I couldn't wait to get home and start the next one. Morrison's New X-Men graphic novels are like a book that you just can't put down.The mutant called Dust makes her first appearance (ever) in this book, albeit briefly and she's not really in the next volume. There's also a teaser to upcoming relationship troubles regarding Scott Summers.The only bad thing about this collection is Igor's art. (I didn't realize Siryn was involved in the action until several pages later because of his art.) The writing by Morrison is great. Rogue agents, Weapon X, and a trip to Genosha's remains are the main topics."
4,My son loves this game,"My son is 8 and he loves this game. He finds it challenging but he gets very excited when he get's to the ""next level"". It's provided hours of entertainment."
3,transformers game,i ordered this ds game for my grandson who is 7 yrs. old. he likes the game alot. it has very good effects on it. he also has the transformers autobots game. this are alot alike. both very good games.
4,"Boys, boys, boys!",If you have sons you will really appreciate the 1/2 hour of peace and quiet this game provides...Boys aged 7-14 will appreciate the graphics and all the action. Parents will enjoy the (largely) non-violent games and how engaged children are in the stories the game creates. Set a time limit on game playing and let the kids enjoy this one!
4,GREAT GAME!,"this is a really well thought out game. it does get very frustrating, which is why it didn't get a 5-star rating. but overall, it is NOT a waste of money."
4,Great Doormat!,"This is a great doormat, especially if you have a dog. We had one like it a while back and wore the thing out after a few years so it was time for a new one. I have seen many similar ones, but this one's the best IMHO due to the clever design and nice typography. I expect it will continue to look good and hold up for a couple of years if used inside. We keep ours next to the sliding glass door to our back yard. I believe if it were exposed to the elements it may have a shorter life."
4,Cute Doormat,"We're pretty happy with the new doormat. Good size. Seems sturdy. I have it on the inside of the house by the sliding patio door, so I ran a vacuum cleaner over it to get the loose stuff off of it. Not too rough for bare feet. The male dog hasn't dug it up like my last door mat (yet) though the female dog pee'd on it already. We sprayed it with urine remover, rinsed it out with the hose outside, and let it dry outside. No leaks since it has a solid rubber backing, no leftover urine smell, and no stain from being cleaned."
1,doormat,"I had this exact same mat before and it lasted me well over 5 years. This one seems to be old and brittle, the coir is already separating from the backing, and there was a big cut in the top of the mat. I had already thrown the box away, and it wasn't worth sending back, but I will not purchase from you again."
5,A wonderful how to book for watercolor,A Wonderful book - well written - Judy Morris gets right to the point in teaching about painting in watercolor.
2,"FALLS APART VERY EASILY. DON""T BOTHER.","I had to give up this bumblebee to the donation box. We didn't need to force a tranform but even so, things started popping off and never stay on for very long. In battle mode the doors always fall off the legs popped off, two pieces (the grill) that covered the chest, gone. It was truly frustrating, annoying and the plastic is cheaply made. I own transformers from 2002 and they were made much better, even then."
5,Kona Coffee Beans,"I am not a coffee lover. However, I like to learn how to distinguish different coffee by types and quality. Based on all reviews on this product, this is a top quality coffee. However, it tastes very bitter to me, comparing to other lower coffee beans I have tried over the years. Can someone tell me that the better quality coffee the bitter taste? My next is to try the Blue Mountain to see the difference."
1,Thankful!,I almost ordered this set by ZAK until I read the reviews. I had no idea that it was plastic. I thought it was deceiving because I would not have known it was plastic unless I read the reviews. Thank you to the person that wrote how disappointed she was.
1,deceptive description,"I was very disappointed when I received my purchase. I was expecting stoneware dishes and did not expect plastic with the ""Pfaltzgraff"" pattern printed on. I did not see anywhere in the description that these dishes were melamine and not stoneware... maybe the price should have been a giveaway."
1,Typical Story,"Dark, by Kenji Jasper, was a typical ""in the hood"" story full of gunshot wounds, loose women, drugs and young black male bravado.A struggle to read because Jasper often comes right out of left field with phrases that have the depth of a glass of water. If thats not enough let the one-demensional characters like Snow Flake and Cuckoo, who never really bring anything to the already weak story, try to entertain you. I will spare you and not quote any specifics here but trust me.I found myself thinking of why the publisher even pick this one up which brings me to the focus of this review. Don't bother buying this book unless you like typical pesudo thug stories with little to offer."
4,GOOD STORY LINE,"I thought that this book was a very good read in that I could relate to what Jasper was talking about. His usage of slang and reaLness made me attached to the novel in some way or another. The one downfall of this novel was the ending. Jasper left his audience in a state of wanting to know more about what happens to Thai when he goes back to D.C. But overall, I must say as a first time author he did a good job."
5,A woman's influence....,"Ostensibly, this is a story about a young man on the lam for having senselessly killed another man. While the primary theme is one of redemption, there is also another theme that runs through this page-turner. It seems as if every male character's action or reaction is either directly or tangentially related to what some woman has done or failed to do. Is the cheating girlfriend or absent mother a convenient excuse for all that transpires? I'm not sure what to make of this. I was also troubled by the author's ability to make me like Thai. Overall, a very good first effort."
3,What's Done In The Dark...,"never really comes to light in this book. We don't find out whether Thai has to face up to his deeds. I will say that I did enjoy the book, though. These ""thug"" books are quite interesting, initially, but then after reading a few of them, they all seem to travel down the same road. Jasper's book, however, borders on thug-lite to me. Not as gritty as Y. Blak Moore's work. Anyway, yeah, the story kept me engaged, especially since I'm somewhat familiar with the DC area. Pretty good debut, but I wouldn't buy it...get it from the library. I'm on a Jasper kick now so it's off to read Dakota Grand. I'd actually give it a 2.5 if I could."
3,A good first book,"First, I have to say that I spent part of my childhood and all of my teen years in Shaw, the neighborhood that the author describes and I do not recall the world that he's talking about. Thai, the protagonist is like a lot of young black men growing up in the inner city. He's never been anywhere but his own 'hood and only dimly realizes that there is a world beyond that. Not until he escapes to North Carolina do the chains on his mind loosen. Dark is a pretty good first book. It's perfect for teens who think they know it all and young adults. Older readers may be put off by the language and hip hop writing style."
1,Copyright protection???? What year is this??????????,"You might find on here what you think is a good deal - Wow... Amazon charging over 60 bucks for this and I got it for 9.99, now I know why. Worthless frisbee with the copyright protection on it. Ridiculous. If you only want to pop it in your cd player...you're fine. If you want to add it to your mp3 player....forget it. What a disappointment. As for the release itself, definitely a 3.7 out of 5. Not their best but definitely an enjoyable cd. I know have to buy it UK version in order to add it to the ipod."
1,Great Album - Horrible Copy Protection,"You can read a review of the complete album on the UK special edition item. This Japan 2 cd edition includes two songs not found elsewhere for now: I'm With Stupid (PSB Maxi-Mix)- excellent mix that sounds more contemporary than the original album mix; Minimal (Tiga's MININIMAL Remix)- just ok.The reason for the low rating on this Import is that the cds have macrovision copy protection which is annoying. If you put this cd in your PC, it will not play but comes up with a software install that is in Japanese (makes sense as it's a Japanese import). If you cannot read Japanese this will pose a problem as you won't know what to even do if you take the chance to install the software to play the cd.if you want to play this on a cd player you should be fine. Not iPod, PC, or MP3 friendly for anyone not able to read Japanese."
1,copyright protection,"I bought the Japanese 2-cd edition of ""Fundamental"". The album is okay, nothing exceptional though. And for those who wonder what the two exclusive songs look like: they are not great, especially the TIGA mix which is very repetitive.The point of my review is the copyright protection. I paid the full price to buy the CDs and I cannot even make myself a copy: I wanted to put one of the songs on a compilation and the song keeps slipping. Furthermore, the CD may have hidden a spyware on my computer - this is usually a program that produces the slipping. Sorry, I am not OK with that and will no longer buy Parlophone CDs as well as PSB releases. More largely, I wonder if it is even worth keeping buying CDs. Finally, I intended to play one of the remixes on a radio show, but I have decided not to give them airplay."
2,"Great sound, but mic sucks bigtime","The earpiece is absolutely fantastic, but don't let anybody fool you. A mic on the side of your mouth will never sound good to the other person on the phone. This one has a very difficult time picking up voices over driving noise (with the windows up!), especially if the A/C is blowing on your face. Multiple people told me it sounded WORSE than the crappy handsfree kit that comes with the phone."
2,Do not recomend,Design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor - people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound/ mic is not clear or muffled. Find an alternate hands free- piece.
1,Waste of money,I bought these and they were a complete waste of money. Did not work at all. No one could hear me when I used theses.
3,Don't Buy It,"The EarWave Boom is very comfortable, but I was told it had an echo sound to it. I switched back to my old earpiece and the sound is much better."
2,Nice but unreliable.,I bought one a few months ago and really liked it but it stopped working after 2 months. So I bought another one thinking it was just a bad apple but 2 months later... the 2nd one stopped working! I'm never going to buy one again- it's a waste of money.
1,terrible,"I liked the comfort and convenience of this headset. However, the parties I am talking to cannot hear me when there is the slightest background noise. Terrible while traveling in a vehicle. I do not use it at all any more because I have to yell & repeat myself to the other party."
1,Broke already!!,"My fault, not what I wanted, nonetheless I was going to make do....but part of the item just broke off. Ugh!!"
5,Good,"Good, I was happy with this product. I got tired of accidentally keeping my bluetooth earpiece in my jean pockets and sending them through the wash, so I bought this and it worked great until I bought a car that had bluetooth built-in."
3,Sound quality is good; earpiece is uncomfortable.,"I find the sound quality of this headset is very good. However, the headset is extremely uncomfortable. It does not sit comfortably around the ear and it often falls off of my ear. The design could be much better if the headset was adjustable like some of the older types were. You cannot adjust this at all."
2,Broken,"This item was broken when I received it so I never had a chance to use it. And because it was so inexpensive, I never bothered to return it."
3,OK Headset,"It works OK, although several folks have said that it was hard to hear me. Not everyone, though, so there could have been other factors. The thing I like least is that it is hard to put on. Maybe it is just me. I'm accustomed to using headsets, but haven't found a quick way to put this on one-handed."
3,it's okay,"This earpiece is an okay product. I wouldn't say great though. It has definetely come in very handy and served it's purpose. However, it said that it had a noise cancelling microphone and I'm not sure if maybe I misunderstood what that meant. I assumed that it would block out sounds other than your voice to the person you were talking to but that is not the case. People have complained about hearing my air conditioning and my music. The music I could understand I suppose, but not the a/c. The other day I had another problem with it when it was plugged in to my cellphone but I couldn't hear anything but the person on the other end could hear me, so I had to unplug it and plug it back in again. Overall, I do like the earpiece but I wouldn't give it an exceptional rating."
1,Stupid!,"The head piece didn't fit my phone. It meant for a small jack style phone, so it will only work on older phones. I have a black berry that came with a wired head piece, I thought this piece would have fit."
2,Jabra EarWave,"Ordered the Jabra EarWave and it arrived quickly. Unfortunately, it didn't work. The time it takes to return it, call a non 800 number to get a RMA # and pay again for shipping, wasn't worth the return effort (probably what they are counting on).I've used the Jabra EarWave in the past and really like the product, but they only last about 4 months. I won't be ordering anything from MobileCity Online again."
3,Awkward to attach,"Not bad. Once you get it attached to the phone and hooked around your ear, then the sound and quality is very good. I have a Treo 600 and have a little trouble getting the plug to attach. I often need to push in a little harder from time to time. Also, earpiece is a little tricky and awkward to wrap around your ear. Takes a little getting used to and then falls out rather easily."
3,short life time,"To be fair, this ear plug has good voice quality and it is comfortable. However, it does not work only after a month. I wrote email to the vendor, but no responds at all."
2,"Marginal quality, poor reliability",I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'
3,"sound quality is good, relability is under question!","I brough it Dec last year,--seems fine untill stopped working last month. I Won't recommend at all."
2,mini eargels missing!,"Well, I liked the headset ok, but the mini eargel kept coming off and finally I lost it. I've been trying to find replacement eargels,but its impossible! No one sells them, so now I'm out of luck. I'll have to buy a whole new headset. Don't recommend this item. Keep shopping!"
5,Wired phone bliss,For the money these are great. I use these for a home based business and they get a years worth of abuse in a month. That being the case one will last me between 3-18 months then the wire will develop a break (normal) but at these prices I can toss the bad and replace on the cheap.
4,Jabra Earwave Boom,I prefer hard wired earpiece even with the inconvenience of the wire. This item is versatile and easy to wear.
2,"it's cute, but the sound is too low","it's not too good,it can hear clearly from the other side,but it's very hard for the other side to hear me. the sound is too low."
1,"Loved it, then hated it","I bought one of these and really liked it... for about six months until it stopped working; no audio; like the wire was cut. Stubborn guy that I am, I bought the same model again. I really liked how it fit my ear and sounded. Four months later (yesterday) headset number two died in the same way number one gave up the ghost. Am I willing to try for three strikes? No way!"
5,The perfect headset!,"I just bought this headset and I am so happy with it. I cannot wear earbud-type headsets because the opening to my ear is very small and even the smallest bud doesn't fit - I know a lot of people with the same problem. This is the perfect solution because the bud is sort of pointed and just barely goes into the outer ear. This is so much more clear, I use it in the car, around the house, etc. The way the mike is set up, it is not ideal for windy conditions at all. Everyone that I have talked to says that it is very clear, they would not know I was on a headset. I highly recommend this product."
2,Needs improvement,"The sound quality is very good on my end. I can hear the people I am talking to better than directly with a handset. The gels are good and overall weight of the unit is comfortable enough on the ear.However...Everyone I have talked to has complained of a significant loss of clarity on their end, especially when I am driving in a car.My suggestion is to look for a better quality product."
1,Do not buy the EarWave Boom,"I need to use the hands-free while driving b/c our city has a law that requires you to do so. I bought the Jabra EarWave Boom b/c my last hands-free boom broke. The main problem is as follows:The earpiece is plastic and sits in your ear--It comes with two different size plastic attachments and one should be better than the other for you. Some may find the attachment inside the ear uncomfortable, but I think it's fine if it were to actually stay in your ear. You cannot move your head from side to side without the earpiece coming out--this is a problem if you are trying to drive. If the earpiece comes out of your ear, you will not be able to hear the person on the other line--at all. If you turn up your phone to compensate you can hear a little better. That is until the earpiece falls back into place, and then you get blasted by it being too loud. I have found the plantronics boom to be much better, and would recommend that before the Jabra.This is not a good product."
2,Not all that good.,I purchased this because my other battery died. I charged this up and started using it. I do not use my phone all that much so it mostly sits idle. I can only get about 3 days on a full charge with the phone just sitting on (not using it) before its dead. I would look elsewhere before I buy this.
2,Not Bad,"Not a bad read- the writing is a bit sophmoric, and I think Colin's story would have been more compelling had he utilized a ghostwriter, but overall he describes the horrific experience of being imprisoned in a Thai prison in grotesque and disturbing detail. I honestly don't sympathize with him too much though, as I think his actions prior to his arrest, and his subsequent behavior in court and in prison indicate a hot-headed personality; if he had been able to control that temper he likely never would have ended up in prison in the first place.[...]"
2,"Nothing we don't already know about prison, very boring","This here is a story of a business man who sees an opportunity and then realizes he just got conned of his life savings, one event leads to another next thing you know he is being charged with murder and is now facing life in prison.It took me some time to finish reading this book, I'm a big fan of prison documentaries such as MSNBC Lock Up and Banged up abroad, this book here failed to shock me, nothing most people don't already know about life in prison, from what the author summons, the only difference between American Prisons and Thai prisons is the Thai justice system is much slower and no one in court speaks English, the prisons are more crowded and dirty, that's it, nothing new in this book.The one true book that I found to be shocking was ""4,000 Days: My Life and Survival in a Bangkok Prison"" by Warren Fellows, Warren Fellows book is a much more fascinating and entertaining read."
5,Super powerful magnets,"We bought these magnets to go with another purchase of thinking putty. They are very strong and fun for the kids to perform experiments with various objects around the house. As recommended on the website, small children should be careful or they could get pinched."
3,Durability!,I was amazed by how easy they start to break in little pieces from the magnets so I was kind of dissapointed in that point of view but the other think that I was really surprised is that this magnet are pretty strong so you need to be careful with your fingers. But just think do you really need it? For what? And for how long?
3,They were great magnets until they started to break.,"I bought these magnets to use and to play with because they were only $10. They were a great buy. I couldn't believe how strong they were and it was fun to see if people could pull them apart. However, with in 24 hours they started to break and crumble. The chrome plating started to peel. Now they are useless. I don't know if they were defective or not? Anybody? They were cool until they broke."
3,Powerful but very brittle,"These magnets are really powerful - it needs considerable effort to separate them from one another. I do not have any particular use for them, I just like magnets and got these to play with. I like square shaped magnets and that is the reason I did not go for Buckyballs. These are fun to play with too, but one needs to be careful - especially fingers as the skin might get caught in between. If you get them too close to your laptop/PC, you run the risk of damaging your HDD. My laptop rebooted once I got it too close to the processor.In general they are very good and powerful. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because they are very brittle. Within first week half the magnets had some chipping. I wonder if they could enclose the magnet within some kind of resin/rubber to make it less prone to flaking."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I expected to receive a ""Kit"" of Kodak lens cleaning cloths per the clearly posted picture on the item ordering page. I only received one lens cleaning package.I paid $1.99 for the product and $6.94 for shipping. I expect this amount of shipping is required for a full case as shown in your product discription, which is why I am sure you made a mistake by only sending one sleeve of lens cleaning wipes. Based on how thin the wipes are, I would expect a whloe case of them to cast you as the distributor less than the $1.99 I paid for the entire case.Outrageous, frivolous, and downright THIEVERY!!!"
4,i am glad they finaly fixed the photo,I was expecting a entire box of these things picture is very miss leading i paid for 2 of these things and it is such a rip off .If you do buy this you get one of the things in the box in the picture...UPDATE... I am very glad tiffin updated their picture after i posted my own. now people will not be confused. i changed my rating to 4 stars now
1,False advertising,The lens cleaning tissue I received is made by Tiffen. Why is it advertised as Kodak? This is very misleading and in my opinion false advertisement.
3,"Good product, bat way too expensive",My wife like the J.A. Henckels Twin Signature 2-1/2-Inch Peeling Knife.However the price is way too high for the value!
3,It works but the pocket is useless!,"The quality is not that great(stereo doesn't fit as snug as I would like), but it was easy to put in and had good instructions. The pocket is completely useless and if anything gets stuck in it its a pain to get out."
5,Hound Dog Taylor - 'Release The Hound',"This is a terrific show and probably THE Hound Dog Taylor album to own. This is a fantastic live raw blues, played energetically whilst the band is in 'top condition'.Hound Dog's lazy friendly voice nailing each tune. Plus the bands really in shape too..a neat drum solo, absolutely crankin' slide tones, groovin' bass... fun fun fun !!! Let's get drunk !...I own his other albums [which are very 'raw shows' and possibly a bit too rough for everyday listening].But this CD is a truely great record,thoroughly enjoyable and timelessly exciting. *(Mind you..beware if you are into homogenised white blues)..this set is 'real' electric slide-guitar juke-joint boogie & blues music.Presently on permanent rotation in my car stereo.This is one of the best 'live' blues shows on record ever...I'd say *[I own possibly 6,000 cd's and records]."
3,it was a good read,I did a book report on this in 5th grade and I can't remember what it was about but I do remember enjoying the way it was written.
5,HOUBA!!,"This is my first foray into the world of Marsupilami and all i can say is that i'm hooked. The stories are wacky and slightly offbeat compared to the the usual Disney fare. Apparently due to some rights issues Disney was stopped from making any more than 13 episodes of this cracking series so therefore this furry yellow marsupial is quite a rarity in the Disney cannon especially to us mere mortals in the UK (Where as far as i know it has never been aired....WHICH IS A CRIME!!). Apparently the French reclaimed it and made quite a long running animation series themselves which stuck more faithfully to the character that aoccupies their albums (graphic novels). I would recommend this Disney version just for the curiosity value alone to those outside of the USA or Canada. Actually bought this VHS tape for my nephew, but might reclaim it for myself, ha!Great unique stuff even for 32 year olds. Lol."
4,"Good morals, alittle slow","It was a good story, but things happend so slowly that it was hard to stay awake to finish it."
1,Worst acting EVER!,"This movie is a Dog! Its hardly even about the dog.I seriously cannot emphasize how bad the writing and acting is in the movie. I do not see how this is about the dog either. The other reviewers just had to be on something to rate it 5 stars.Some of the settings are very beautiful, and Louis Gossett's great voice, narration cannot even warrant me rating this any higher.Save yourself!!"
4,The best ac adapter yet.,This is like the 5th ac adapter I have had to buy for this HP. This is the best one yet with the head at a 90 degree angle instead of straight. Worth the extra money.
3,It is a okay item.,It sucks smoke and the room is less smoky but not as well as I expected. I guess you get what you paid for.
1,Sucky sucking,"I bought this product for my wife, who, unfortunately, is a smoker, and a recalcitrant one at that. My house still reeks."
1,Poor Construction,This product worked very well as far as eliminating the smoke. The on and off switch broke after a week. There was no way to put that parts that fell out back together. Don't waste your money!!!!
4,product works,"I bought 2 of this product. I think it works great, but my husband won't use it. I think he's too stuborn."
2,Boy Banned,"If you're looking for gay erotica you'll likely be pleased with this with this book, however, there's little else of interest here. This is a series of sexual encounters losely hung on a framework of a boy band's rise to stardom. The author takes us from the formation of the band through their budding popularity, setting up many dramatic situations along the way, then proceeds to gloss them over or ignore them altogether. One boy is filled with jealousy one moment, then suddenly is the chief proponent of open relationships. Another is frantic about an ""unsafe"" encounter and then has totally forgotten about it a few pages later. (...)"
2,How Bored Are You?,"This is a very poorly written book. The characters aren't even two dimensional and the plot line is just a vapid excuse for a series of erotic adventures which are both implausible and conventionally written. From that perspective, it is better written than some; so if you are looking for erotica to stimulate then you will...enjoy this book. Otherwise, don't waste your time and money."
4,"sexy, suspensfull, and loving",A good read from the frist audtion through the biggest concert ever. and some pretty hot sex seence too like in the toilet in the frist chapter wow!!!
5,"Captivating story, I highly recommend it.","Captivating story of Gary, an ordinary man who experiences one of life's most heartbreaking losses. How Gary deals with his loss is instructive and thought provoking. Knobbs has a keen eye for the nuances of corporate culture and suburban life. His observations are right on target, I found myself saying ""yes, exactly"" throughout the book. I highly recommend this book- those I've shared it with immediately became caught up in the story and found it difficult to put down."
5,Randy,"Randy is a delightful book that speaks to the heart. It is an easy read and yet one that speaks of important matters of life and death, love and loss, grief and rebirth. The book draws you in, letting you experience extraordinary relationships under extraordinary circumstances. I recommend it for all ages."
3,"Old Book, New Title!","I read this book a few years ago when it was published in paperback under Avon as Sleeping with the Agent. I remember liking it well enough, hence the three stars. When I came across Sleeper in my recommendations, I remembered the author and decided to purchase the Kindle edition due to the reasonable price. When I began to read however, I had a huge case of deja vu. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to the description, but I knew I hadn't read a Low book by that title before. Sure enough, I checked one of my Gennita Low paperbacks and discovered that Sleeper and Sleeping with the Agent are the very same book! This is not to say that I will not read the book again, but it is frustrating to realize you've been duped by a change in title. It would've been nice to have had a little warning about such changes with the Kindle edition...."
4,A good conclusion,I was looking for a fast paced series to read while waiting for others to be released. Was a great conclusion to the series and enjoyed the book.
4,What's with Lily?,"In ""The Hunter"" Lily was quick, independent & didn't let anyone interfere with her goals. In ""Sleeping With the Agent"" she became clingy, wimpy & allowed Reed to lead her around and make decisions for her. To me this character was ruined & a book I was looking forward to a disappointment.I gave it a four because of the inclusion of other characters that were more interesting than the leads. Lily never seemed to catch on to the fact that Reed came into this assignment with every intention of killing her. Color me crazy but that would be a relationship breaker to me."
2,Noisy NAS200,"This unit is really easy to setup and installing drives is a breeze But .... the noise!There is a really high pitched noise that grates on your nerves, removed the drives but the noise lives. If you are lucky enough to be missing high frequency hearing no problem otherwise avoid this unit."
5,Great Product!!!,I have had this for now over a week. It is all what I expected. I also bought 2 500 gig Western Digital Hard drives. Installation was a breeze. Accessing the drives was just what I expected. Yes doing large amount of files transfers is slow but this for the money is well worth it.Also setting up the FTP server was easy too.
3,Slow start-up,"It takes around 3min to start up. I found that while network interface is already up (ping goes), the web-interface and accessing filesystem (net use..) still does not work and I have to wait several minutes until beep signals it is ready.Maybe I do something wrong? I am going to contact their support.The rest is OK (although transfer speed could be better than 3MB/s )"
2,Great Idea but WAY too slow,"Like most things I buy, I researched this pretty well and decided that, for the money, I would be willing to deal with what people reported as being slow write performance to the drives on this device. What I didn't quite realize is just how slow it would be... folks, it is very slow... in my case, painfully slow. I'm sending this one back and will wait for the Windows Home Server devices to start shipping this Christmas season. My config, for the record, was two 500GB Seagate SATA drives, configured to be seen as one logical drive. Set up was easy, it does work, and it is affordable... but, to back-up a single PC takes almost all night long. And FORGET about moving your ripped video and music onto this."
1,Slooooooooooooowww,If you want to store data and not care how long it takes to retrieve...or if you want to transfer data at modem speeds this is for you.I returned mine.
2,"Very slowwwwww!, slow to copy, slower to boot than a PC!","I use this product as a media server with 2 drives of 500 gb each, with D-link DSM520 for playing digital content into my TV, works fine, the setup was very easy but.....1. The boot time it's terrible!, almost 5mins, so when I want to watch some movie from the nas200 I've to wait until boot!!!2. It's so slow when I tried to copy my digital contento into the drive3. Uses it's own format and security"
3,Piece of garbage,"What a monumental, unequivocal, unbelievable, piece of garbage! But don't take my word for it. Visit their web site and read the problems the owners of this waste of money have to say. This item drops off my network three times a day forcing me to go through the install process again and again. Honestly, if you have the cash to spend on this, do yourself a favor and just fold it up and light a cigar with it. You would get more satisfaction. The only reason it is rated 3 stars is because I can't change this in the edit mode."
4,"Easy setup, nice interface","Have this by 5 months now, no overheating (it depends were you put the equipment i.e: next to windows, closet), to reduce the ""overheating"" some people are reporting, change the wait time to enter in sleep mode to 10 minutes, and the fan time too , I have two 1 TB seagate working on it with no problem at all. (one tip, if you format the hd with journaled it will be more secure but slow, so if you need more speed go to the setup and format your HD's with non-journaled devices, do a backup first it will erase all data in your HD).Remember this is for home device use, I use this with a D-link dsm 520 and works perfectly, the media server is very nice and noticed no lag problems working with dsm 520 wireless with movies.Another thing, use one good router with high speed and the system runs nice !Slow? It depends of the patience of the user and how he did the setup."
3,Ok for the budget-minded,"I got the NAS200 as my first NAS device and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. The set up is fairly trivial, I was able to get a RAID1 with share going in less than an hour (the majority of time being taken up by drive formatting). Unfortunately, the performance is atrocious, not even measuring up to what I'd expect from 100BaseT. If you want simple, relatively cheap network storage with no expectations of real time stream, fine. But if you're wanting something with more oomph, look elsewhere."
2,Needs slight improvement,"I found the NAS 200 to install quite easily. Documentation is clear and server and disk adminstration tools are easy to use. However, this storage systems often drops off-line requiring a power down re-boot, the data transfer speeds seem very slow and the inability to re-name the internal and USB attached drives are all short comings of the design of the product."
2,Chews through HDDs,"Worked great for about 18 months, then began burning up my hard drives. I'm on my fourth new hard drive in the past 6 months. Fortunately, Western Digital and Seagate have 5 yr warranties.I've also had a hard time getting windows to recognize it after it goes into power save mode. My DNS-321 seems to work better at being recognized throughout my home network."
2,Too slow,"I liked the features of the NAS200 and went ahead and purchased it even though many of the online reviews complained about the overall speed of the device.In the end, this unit was too slow fo rme to work with. It took hours to load my picture and music files to the NAS unit, and actually working through the files was painful.I retruned this unit and purchased a different one. I suggest that if you are looking for a low-cost network storage unit that performs well, you look at the Iomega or Western Digital products. Niether has the disk configuration features of the Linksys NAS200, but both have the performance that you need."
4,Best NAS product in the price range.,"This is the best NAS product I fund on the market in the $100-200 range.Great security design. Really similar with MS Windows sharing design. It supports everything at the user/share level, but not at the directory level. - I believe Linksys intended to do this. If you go to their higher-level NAS product, they support lot of more security functions. It supports long passwords with special characters.This device supports Chinese characters.The only issue I fund is the throughput. The highest I got is 25-28mbps for very large files. For regular size files, I only got 2-4mbps.The backup software user interface looks good but I did not test the functions - I don't use the function."
4,"Works well, hard to setup","Now that it is working I love it, but getting it running was not fun. Be prepared to baby it thru the setup and use only IE to do the setup."
2,Worked well for about 2 years but is now virtually unusable,I have had the device for almost 2 years now and it has served me well. In the past 2-3 months I have had this issue where the device has become very slow and then drops connections. Extremely frustrating - to a point where it has tainted my impression of the product. So now I have decided to switch to a different brand all together for my NAS needs. I am going to try Western Digital's MyBookLiveDuo.I still like routers and switches from Cisco but I would not go to a Cisco NAS!
1,"SLOW SLOW SLOW, you've been warned!","I am in the IT field. I have always been a fan of Cisco and am Cisco certified. This product does not deserve the paint the name is stenciled on with. It is beyond slow. Trying to transfer even small files is agonizingly slow. As of late it is too slow to even use to back up quicken files to on the fly and Quicken errors out. I have to WD 2TB hard drives in it, one loaded down with .iso images the other loaded with files. I need to delete the .iso images but at the data transfer rate I don't have an entire weekend to devote to it. I'll be spending the cash on a new device very soon and will not even consider giving this one to a friend or family member, because I'd never hear the end of the phone calls to support it."
1,Too Slow,"What a shame! This is a great product idea that lacks the needed speed to actually be useful. After a lot of time setting up and transferring files, I am returning this unit. I had the unit set up for RAID-1 (mirror) with two of the recommended 500 Gig Segates. The transfer rates are so slow that it is literally unusable. Also, although the external temperature was not obviously hot, the inside disks were smokin'. I expect more from linksys/cisco."
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap performance","I researched a lot of home NAS devices, and eventually decieded based on price. This unit was the cheapest, and had the funtionality I needed.However, performance was very poor, probalby due to the low power CPU the unit has.A unit like this would be great for storing backups, etc (items you dont use very often), but for music/video/sentralized storage, I'd NOT recommend this produnt."
2,"Easy to use, but too slow to be worth it.","The other reviews that state how slow this device is are not exaggerations and the issue of speed is not trivial. By the very nature of the device it is going to be used to store massive amounts of data and the fact that the speed never crests a few megabits/sec I am not quite sure how they expect people to do that. It is a very straightforward and easy to use product and presumably if you just want to share smaller files like pictures and music then it could very well be for you, but anything other than a megabyte at a time and you will find yourself like me: frustrated at how great the other parts of it are, and how useless the rest is because of the speed."
2,"net storage ,but slow","the nas200 at first seemed like a really good idea ,it's set up was easy ,and methodical. but my first sense of its slow speed should have prompted me to return it. it cannot play video without glitching. for a 1.5 TB array ,it took 4 days to fill the drive from my pc ! i recomend this device for audio or pictures only. it's too slow for video. it's net speed is listed as 10/100 ,but i doubt it."
1,Stay AWAY AWAY AWAY from the NAS200,"Stay AWAY from this item! It has a number of heat dissipation issues (just read the Linksys forum postings) in its design. Within 2 days of getting this, and trying to copy several hundred gigabytes worth of data to the unit, it not only cooked itself (won't even boot anymore) - but it also cooked both of the brand new Seagate 500GB SATA drives I installed on it! I'm returning this NAS200 unit as fast as I can, but now I am left hoping Seagate will replace the drives under warranty.If you have a few gigabytes worth of data to back up (maybe like 10 or less) it might be ok. Do NOT buy it if you want a serious home network backup for large quantities of data, where you will be doing long, sustained read or write operations..."
3,Super Slow,You get what you pay for..This machine is fine for hosting small files such as pictures and such but if you looking to stream information from it you might want to look for something with a bit more processing power. Even using a gigabyte connection any type of streaming will lag. I brought this primarly to backup my computers it takes entierly to long with the NAS200's integrated processor.I think saving abit more money would yield better results in the long run.
2,Very disappointed,"I was ready for it to be slow, I just wanted a big disk that was easy to setup, but this thing is way too random. Sometimes you cannot connect, sometimes the admin password does not work, and it is incredibly slow. I am normally a fan of linksys, but stay away from this product in my opinion."
1,A piece of NAS Junk,"It is unbelievable that Cisco put out such a piece of NAS junk. The UPnP hardly works, half of the time, the server cannot be seen by other network devices (Xbox 360, PC, etc.) The Folder structure for separate users is not even close to a high-school CS student writing a SW. Frankly, It is a total disappointment."
2,Linksys Quality...ooops,I put 2 identical 1.5TB drives in this.. used it for a bit.. now I can't see the disks.Imagine that..a Linksys device not working after some use.
1,Bad hardware!!,"Piece of junk. Support says something wrong take out hard drive, unplug everything, take out power cord and the wait and restart the thing. Whereafter you will buy yourself 15 minutes of access to you data before the drive locks you out again. Linksys is well aware of this and there has been no fix offered only suggestion is send it back exchange for another one. Whig of course will do the exact same thing, by the technicians own admission.Having access for 15 minutes at a time we. All tell that a working NAS file server with Media Server would be great to have and we will be getting another brand and one that is not purchased based hardly on low price.With this product it is NO BARGIN! You really do get what you pay for."
1,Slow and Heats up,"I was looking for a solution to share multimedia at home environment. Unfortunately NAS failed after sometime of use because was too hot , and also hanged while copying data to it.For backup only.Not recommended."
3,Slow but streams good,PRO:- Easy to setup- No other software needed- Shares are easy to setup- Permissions are easy to setup- Good streaming speed (I use it to store TV series and then stream them to my media center PCs)- Have had no problems from power outagesCON:- Transferring files to and from the NAS is slow. I can transfer the same file to another computer on the network much faster- Fans are noisy but not bad- Slow bootupConclusion:It is a keeper for storage and streaming.
1,Don't buy this product.,"This product is a disgrace and Linksys should never have put this product out. I was looking for a NAS solution for a small business, this is not the solution. The hard drives ran very very hot. I am concerned that this shortened the lives of the hard drives I put in. They were so hot, I was concerned it would become a fire hazard. The NAS was unreachable half the time. There is no easy way to map the NAS through windows without running their software. Account management was less functional than I hoped. I sent this product back."
1,SLOW slow slow and loud loud loud,Clumsy install. Formatting a 1TB disk times out and you have to start over.The fan is LOUD! Way louder than a gaming PC.And it is slow. 20 hours to copy 200GB! Unacceptable.
1,Needs More Speed,"Although Linksys makes good products, this one falls short of expectations. It's really slow and causes ones network to slow down. Even when connecting an external USB HD, transferring files is soooooo slow, it's quicker to copying them via floppy...yes, the old floppy method.Linksys has the right idea, but the processor on this device is sub-par."
2,No one has talked about noise...,"This product is slow, on a 100 mbps network it can only manage at best speeds that are around a attached USB drive. Might as well just get USB enclosures, as most of them are far less noisy.I found this thing had little insulation, placing the drives next to each other, I found their noise was intolerable, especially since it did nothing to hide the high-pitched SATA whine.I have gotten other drive enclosures from Western Digital(SATA-only) that are very quiet and faster than this is on the network.The streaming media server is a joke and trying to mount a network drive and watch a TV show or movie stored there causes errors, even Itunes mounted onto that drive kept crashing due to drive timeouts.It works as a backup, but as a actual attached storage it doesn't move fast enough to work with files in any real way."
3,OK but not that great,This is an OK product and does what it is supposed to do. Slightly noisy but may be quiet compared to other brand units. I have a problem where I have to remount the drives often which is a linksys wireless issue. If not for the remounting requirement (which they provide software to do this - so must be a common problem) I would have given it a higher rating.UPDATE 2009: This turned out to be such a pain that I took out the hard drives and threw it away. Just goes to show first impressions can be misleading. Not recommended.
2,Nice idea but better availble on the market,"I purchased this product for the media serving capabilities hoping to have this available to my SONOS and PS3. I have a 1TB SATA drive in the unit. Configuration was very easy, took minutes with no real thinking needed.In use, the product is PAINFULLY SLOW. As a media server it's not that good either. Video files do not serve up to the PS3, all show as unsupported data. Getting data onto the unit takes forever."
1,Not a true NAS device,"Another in the long line of subpar linksys (a division of cisco) products. I really thought this would be a hard thing to screw up but leave it to the fine folks at linksys to send me a network attached device that requires a special device driver to be loaded on any computer that wishes to access it. It is, in fact, a rigged up usb device that is incedibly slow. There is actually a TSR for you to map drives because you can't do it from the network neighborhood (my network places, whatever). Thanks linksys I love products that decrease the amount of free memory available.Sending it back."
1,3 reasons,"The 3 reasons people buy this is for Speed, Ease and Security. The problem is that this unit deliverers none of the 3. Most of the low review here is because of how slow it is. I mistakenly thought it would be more plug and play and easier than networking hard drives on different computers. I thought it would be safe for backing up data... unfortunately it uses a different file system than FAT or NTFS... it's not possible to take out one of the hard drives and put it in another computer or enclosure and read the data.Customer support is the worst I've seen.I still use my NAS200 because I wouldn't feel right selling it to a friend, but I won't trust it with important data. Go buy an external hard drive instead and network it instead."
3,Hit and Trial,"It is a thought provoking book. Forces the reader to think differently. Sometimes the author nearly convinces the reader about his view point. It appears to be that Erich is fully confident that even the God do his matters on ""Hit & Trial"" methods. Appart from that, the author has done good research on various eras and times of the world."
3,Good read,I thought the story was okay and the art was pretty good.i won't say that it was a knockout but I was kept interested throughout.
4,The best,"Love his music, love his style, especially when he goes latin. We had the privledge of seeing him in concert and he did a rendition of the Little Drummer Boy that was incredible. I never knew you could get such sounds from a flute. I like jazz when it doesn't become overwhelmingly abstract. His style is perfect for me and I truly enjoy all of it."
3,Not Bad for a coffee shop freebie!,"Well after sitting in a local coffee shop talking about the election, my friends and I were on our way out and noticed a stack of these cd's sitting under a sign saying ""free! just take one please!""... So I did and am listening to it now as I type. The music these guys put together is reminiscent of old 70's folk rock in one song, only to shift to 80's bar band sound in the next track. The all of a sudden we are singing along to John Mellencamp style Soft Rock/Easy Listening. All in all a varied and diverse collection of songs, some of which have quite catchy lyrics...but this album has little in the way of unity as a whole. I would not recomend paying the 18+ bucks to buy this disc however...instead find your (free) copy at Van Gogh's Ear in Union, NJ."
4,flavored apples,"Like the other stretch island fruit leather, these are made up mostly of apples, flavored with other fruit. They taste great, though are not as 'smooth' as additive laden fruit leather. Strawberry is probably our second favorite flavor after tropical."
2,"Healthy, but not so yummy","I bought these after seeing fruit leather in the stores contained trans fats, now I know what the trans fats do for the fruit leather. This just was strange and too thick. I didn't mind the strawberry flavor but we all hated the cherry. I won't be buying these again, I will make my own in my dehydrator."
5,Perfect,This fit my HONDA CIVIC VP 2004 - The fit is perfect and far less in price than letting jiffylube or a mechanic check and change. Anyone can do this installation with this filter and a philips screw driver.Absolutely stellar product.
3,Make Up Your Own Mind,"So the purpose of this release is to capture the live sound, which of course it does - yet having seen the dvd/listened to the cd my thoughts of this release are that it's, well ...okay. I'd prefer the Black Sessions gig, although understand that was more of a production than Live Consternation, which is pretty raw (and that's not necessarily a bad thing). Track selection is good, more varied than I expected when I first heard of the concept. At the end of the day it's Katatonia, so of course warrants serious attention. If you're like me you won't be disappointed, and in the same probably won't be blown away."
4,Decent DVD,"Great to have a DVD of Katatonia. Audio quality on the older songs far surpasses the studio versions. The songs from ""The Great Cold Distance"" didn't sound as great as I had hoped. The guitar tone on this DVD is a bit digital, and sounds odd on the new material, but is an improvement over what is on their older recordings. Video is decent. Mixing could have been done a little bit better, with a better balance between parts. A great item to have!! Hope they shoot a better DVD soon though."
1,Learn The Songs of Phil Ochs - but NOT from KOLS,"Phil Ochs was a moral & artistic genius. And to see his efforts brought this low, is a travesty beyond recall. I highly recommend Mr Ochs and many of the other fine artists covering his songs. But try to stay away from these guys."
3,Good elements but too much filler,"Kathryn Falk knows her romances, and has assembled a collection of short writings by various published romance authors that vary in usefulness. Some get down to the nitty-gritty, others just skim over the topic. There are many useful tips to be gleaned, however, about writing today's sex scenes, the ""new"" types of romances and so forth.The problem with the book is that Falk has inserted a lot of filler material, pages purporting to be ""letters"" from young, aspiring romance writers (who haven't actually written anything), and her own chatty replies to these letters which don't really convey a lot of hard-core information to the serious writer.In a future book, Falk should cut out all filler material, and replace it with writings from the romance authors who are in the trenches."
2,"Too many ""shoulds""","I didn't really care for this book. It *does* have alot of filler, like the last reviewer said. And Falk is rather full of herself when it comes to writing. Obviously she is published, so her method of plotting and preparing worked for her. However, I think it will do a beginning author a disservice to think it is the *only* way."
3,Repeat of Original,I knew this was a renewed book based on the original. After I got it I realized I didn't really need this one...I have the original and I can get the updated info online.
4,Not bad,"This is a easy-reader for people who is interested in urban studies. The author introduces a number of theories and ways in related to study a city.The good thing is that you don't need spend a lot of time to go through the book, and still get what you want."
2,The first paragraph shows muddled thinking,"I was astonished to see such a simple-minded error in the first paragraph when they claim that Max Weber published ""The City"" before Engels published the ""The Condition of the Working Class in England."" They also claim that both books were published in the 19th century. Only Engels' book was. They confusingly listed the publication date for each book to be 1966 and 1973, respectively, obviously using the publication dates of whatever editions they happened to read. That's rather pointless for purposes of intellectual chronology, no? I have to wonder whether the authors are well acquainted with either Weber or Engels to be able to make such a simplistic error.After encountering such a sophomoric error on the first page, my faith in the abilities of the authors was shattered and I can only use this book to point me to other, more mature, scholars.Yes I have a bug up my ass."
4,"lot's o' poetry, not just love poetry","Good book. Not great.Although it has plenty of ""love poetry"" it also has poetry that you would definitely consider a downer.Not all love and roses."
5,"Yes, Yes, Nanetta!","If you have been looking for help with color palettes and style,here's the right book for you!Once we have learned the basic techniques of polymer clay, the next step (which is a big one) is color and design.Here Nanetta helps you see, the colors and blends of clay that will produce certain effects. She has examples of the colors one would use in a Jewel Palette, or Noir, or Cloisonne'!What Nan Roche was for technique, Nanetta Bananto is for color and style! Thank You Nanetta!"
2,not your typical polymer clay jewelry book........,"......and that may be just be what you are looking for. If you'd like to step away from the usual beads and the like of many pc jewelry books, then check out this book. For the rest of you, look elsewhere, as I will be doing when I'm done writing this review. Personally, I don't care for the asian pendant or egyptian pin or the tribal choker that are all included in this book. Other projects include : bamboo pin, scrap clay earrings, mermaid pin. Just not my style. To the authors' credit, there are lovely pictures and lots of instruction. I hope that this will help you make an informed desicion to buy this book or not."
3,Not the right one,I will keep this CD even thought it is the wrong one because it is ok as far a content goes. However I did not tell the seller of there miss order because I didn't feel I had paid to much for what I received. Only the trouble of reordering is all I am Out.Cara Smith
5,Holy Spirit led Christianity,"Long before LaHaye collaborated on end-times fiction books, he wrote this insightful volume on how the Christian walks by the Holy Spirit. I recommend it as a great source for learning what the Bible has to say about the mind of Spirit-led Christians. Patrick McIntyre, author of The Graham Formula.."
2,Well produced but NOT original/innovative...,"This is monotonous chicago house. Elements of jazz, soul, blues, and loud vocals (TOO MUCH!) in a well-produced house album, but somehow the overall feel of the entire CD is plain and boring. Not a bit of creativity here. Not terribly bad, just stuff that you won't listen to if you have another CD around.There's much better HOUSE music out there, the crazy loud vocals ruined this one for me."
2,disappointed,"I have a crummy old oxford english dictionary i got at a garage sale 15 years ago for a buck, and it beats this one 10 to one. All the words in this one you know how to spell and the meaning of already! Don't waste your money."
5,A Dashing Tale,"I was wary at first to read the books in this series, coming from Avon. When you think of the typical romance novels that they produce, you usually come across ninny girls who want to have sex with a big buff guy. End of story.So not the case with Anna and the Duke. Anna and Ewan actually have more dimensions to themselves than just their sex drive. Although they're not setting out to fall for one another, they follow their hearts to be together. There is also another underlying plot here, which is what makes the book succeed. It's really a good, suspensful novel that includes romance, it doesn't just center on that. I love that the characters have different facets to them that make them real, like abandonedment issues, being forced to do things by your parents. This book is definately a 110% book!"
3,I would have expected something better....,"Anna and the Duke is an ok book, with an interesting plot. But the book is, for lack of a better word, cheesy. To me, it seemed unrealistic and---stupid. I can tell when I've read a good book by how I feel after reading it. With a good book, I won't be able to think about anything else for a week, just running the story over and over in my head; even as I'm reading another book. While the book seems interesting from the back cover, it is not a book that I would reccomend to anyone. If you are looking for a romance of this time period, read Jane Austen's works. They (especially Pride and Prejudice) leave me happy for a week!"
5,The Best book in the series BY FAR!!!!!!!!!,"This has GOT to be the best book of them all! I loved this one the most 'cause it was the most ""romancy"" :) Ewan is from Scottland and comes to England to RELUCTANTLY inherit his father's title as duke. Along the way he meets the beautiful Anna who ""captures his heart."" But she is engaged to his half brother who is determined to have Ewan's title!!!!!!!"
2,Zippers Broken,This was the exact bag I was looking for and was excited to receive it. It worked great for about 10 practices until the zipper to the main ball compartment broke twice. First the zipper handle came off so I had to use a paper clip - then the zipper it self would not stay zipped - would pull apart very easily. I only had 5 balls in the bag when this happened. A wasted purchase - had to replace it with a different bag that i now love.
1,Never received product after 2 attempt,Not sure how I can review a product that I did not received. I ordered this product and received it right away in record time except it wasn't the product I ordered. I returned it hoping it was a legitimate error and customer service was very apologetic. They sent me a new one right away and it was the same wrong product again. They keep sending me a huge equipment bag that holds 18 balls.I called again and once again they told me that they were sorry and they will make sure this time they send me the right product. I sent the wrong one back and in a couple of days my order was cancelled and my credit card credited.
3,I did a mistake with the address for the delivery,"Good Morning:I would like to inform you that I did a mistake giving the address for the delivery of the ""Badem game Day Heavy Duty 6 Ball Bag"", cause that, I would like that you change to the new and correct address with the purpose to get the article as fast as possible. So, the new address is: 4350 Glendale Milford RD Cincinnati OHIO, 45242-3746, Contact Person: Susana Castellanos. Company: Prestige, Track: PP40002762I woul appreciatte the solution of this case.Regards,Pablo Nava."
3,I need a studio to make this stuff.,"I liked most of the ideas in this book. They are beautiful and look doable. The problem is space. Unless you have a garage or outdoor space to make the stuff in you will not be able to make most of these projects. The instructions could also be more detailed by adding information like ""this type of wood"" or ""this type of light fixture"". Still, there are a couple of fantastic ideas I will try like a lantern-looking lamp and a lap blanket. If I hadn't had a gift certificate, I would be dissapointed."
3,Great eye candy,"The projects look great, but intimidating. The materials would be pretty expensive (not counting the tools) & I would hate to mess up & I'm an accomplished diy-er! All the great projects are hard 4/5 skill level. Everything under a skill level 4 is kind of lame for lack of a better word.Nice pictures to look at for inspiration though."
1,So-called Modern and Retro-inspired Projects,"Oldham's book is partially items that are similar to his 21st century mod line of furniture that started out in Target stores some years back and partially retro-inspired pieces. However, most just aren't so ... inspirational. This was released at the perfect moment, when retro was really hot. However, the book is short of ideas that are actually interesting - or attractive. The worst thing for a designer to have is a book that bombs so big that you can easily pick it up in a second-hand store. That's where you'll find this one."
3,"It's a good book, but...","The book features lots of projects that are easy to accomplish if you can sew and if you know some basic carpentry, but not many projects for the non-sewer and non-carpenter. I was hoping for more projects that were a bit easier to assemble from scratch from stuff I already have or for remaking thrift shop and chain store finds, etc.The look is what I would expect from Todd Oldham, given what I have seen of his Target lines of home accessories and furnishings.It is a good book, just not what I was looking for for cheap and easy home decorating ideas."
2,"So much promise, so little delivered.","When I first read reviews of this book, I thought that it had considerable promise - as a grad student, I was looking forward to being able to build some nice things for my apartment. The book simply does not deliver.The author does not seem to share the color sensibility present in many mid-century modern designs - in fact, I don't see much color sensibility at all.The projects, for the most part, are not the most exciting bits of mid-century design, and for the labor that they entail, they do not seem terribly worthwhile. For the most part, one would be better off buying one of these pieces of furniture at the local junk store and spending a few dollars fixing it up.I haven't yet seen a better book, but I really cannot recommend this one."
5,"Really, you can do it.","In my search to find easy handbuilt furniture, I stumbled upon this book by Todd Oldham. It is an easy read complete with instructions and photos that direct the home handyman to build midcentury modern inspired furniture.The plans are easily modified to fit your individual needs and although the resources are identified, most, if not all the items needed can be obtained and cut to order, using the cut list for each project, at your local hardware store.Although I consider myself an experienced woodworker, the novice to average home handyman can easily and effectively craft any of the projects in this book. This is the most practical how to guide I have ever used.Yes, you can do it."
4,Great book of ideas,"This is a neat book with some fun projects. The directions lack in detail, but if you have a basic knowledge of sewing/carpentry, you can fill in the blanks yourself for the most part. There are at least 3 sewing projects (ring stitched blanket, hand quilted pillow and patchwork stripe curtain) from the book that I plan to do, so the book was money well spent for me."
4,"""The Great Mango Book"" by Allen Susser","Its a great visual and gustatory guide to most of the mangoes you will ever encounter, and the recipes are an added bonus"
5,Mint Julep Love,"I love this product! It does exactly what it says. I'm very happy with the results everytime I use it. Fresh, clean, cleared pores and soft skin!"
3,"great, but could be better","This feels great going on, and makes your skin refreshed. I have combination skin and when my skin feels particularly greasy, this soaks the oil up and make it feel less greasy for a couple of days. However, it smells too much of spackle/clay/mud (the minty smell barely covers it). It is a little messy getting it off (as they suggestioned, rub off with warm water and towel). I have also tried leaving it on my zits/pimples/itchy spots overnight, and I think it helps.Overall it is great for the price. It cleanse and make your skin feel refreshed, altho I have not seen a pore reduction.Update: this is a big jar, so if you won't be using it often, get the tube. Mine changed color from minty green to gray green after ~3 years where I've only used 1/2 - 2/3 jar. The tube is 8oz, and much cheaper."
5,Heaven in a Jar!!,"This stuff work very good. Makes my skin feel tight and refreshed. Its a must have!! Queen Helene, great job on this and thank you!!"
5,Great product and a great price,"This product really works. I had really oily skin and big pores but after using this for a few weeks I noticed a great improvement in both. It's not magical or anything--it won't make your pores disappear, but it helps a lot. Also, it smells really good!"
1,Plate Bent,License was shipped in a brown envolope. It was bent so bad i could not use. I uploaded a picture to the vendor-no responce. I thew it in the trash. Bad Bad Bad
5,Henckels are the best,"Great knife, great weight, and durable. I love the Henckels classic collection, no need to spend more unless your a professional. It has stayed sharp even though I am not easy on knives."
5,Nice stands,"These are great jackstands if you need a lot of clearance. They are very big. They are very heavy. They can hold vehicles. Probably overkill for what I needed, but they worked great under my lifted TJ Wrangler without being extended way out like my friend's 6 ton stands were."
2,A lot smaller than I thought,The review should have provided dimensions for the platter and serving bowl. Dinner for two anyone? Otherwise OK.
3,This is the RLDS edition,"Herald was/is the publisher for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now called the Community of Christ, I think).There are quite a few differences between this edition and the LDS edition. Both churches added sections to the book after the split in the mid-to-late 1840's. I think this edition has about 150 sections compared to the 138 + 2 Official Declarations in the LDS edition.As I haven't done more than glance at the book, I'm not really qualified to rate it, but all the reviews here are for the LDS edition and I thought I'd offer this clarification. The 3 stars is just because they won't let me leave it blank."
3,Not the LDS Version,"For all of those who have given specific references to look up in this book, ignore them. This book was published by the RLDS (now Community of Christ). This is NOT the ""Mormon"" Doctrine and Covenants. While some of the early sections are included in both RLDS and LDS editions, the section number and versification are much different and many of the unique doctrines of the LDS Church are not in this book. The publisher, Herald House, is owned by the Community of Christ (RLDS). For the LDS version of the Book of Mormon or Doctrine and Covenants, the publisher is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
3,The Book of LDS Theology,"Looking for what Mormons believe? Don't go to the Book of Mormon, you'll only find a poorly written fantasy story there. For the full dirt on the comical aspects of Mormon theological beliefs, read the Doctrine and Covenants. Here you will find the full definition of polygamy, celestial marriage, baptism of the dead, the Adam-God, and other such beliefs. This is the true Mormon Bible.I give it a Three Star rating not because it is a well-written or enlightening book, but because it is an informative doctrinal work for those curious about this rapidly growing religious sect."
4,Deck chairs,These chairs are great for the price. Bought 4 for $120 w/ free shipping. Put some water sealant on them (instead of the recommended teak oil b/c I had an extra can of the sealant) and it worked fine. They haven't kept their deep color as much as they probably would have w/ the teak oil. Seem pretty sturdy and have held up well outside in the sun/weather for past 6 weeks. Would recommend.
4,Solid so far but shipping container needs work,"Overall I'm happy with these chairs. There has been a tiny amount of sap oozing out of a couple pieces of wood, but so far it's minor. At least I hope it's sap and not some odd cancer resin. The packaging could use improvement as there were some minor scratches on these chairs. I know they had a long journey to get here but at this weight of package unless the container is thought through there are going to be some scratches. So far they are holding their finish well but I have applied teak oil once and will do so every six months or so.Assembly was no problem all the parts were present and the chairs feel solid."
3,Great Value,"Over the past couple of years I have purchased 6 of these chairs and 4 adirondack chairs. They are a good value, and they do look good. I have rated the chairs with 3 stars because they are uncomfortable to sit in (a seat cushion helps) and their finishing stain tends to bleed when wet (I noticed this after I moved the chairs to my new screened porch, which has a concrete floor)."
3,nice chairs but ...,"seem sturdy and appealing looking, but getting them put together, oy! lots of trouble lining up the screw holes, and one seat didnt quite fit into the chair back. i'm not exactly mr handyman but i can screw things together well enough, disappointing for the price. great once theyre together, hope you have better luck than me."
5,"So comfortable, and looks great!!!!","When Amazon says hassle free packaging, they really mean it. Easy to unpack, the instructions were excellent and no parts were missing. The assembly of first chair took the longest... but after that the next three went smoothly. They are esthetically pleasing and comfortable to sit in. With the harsh sun we have in TX the finish has held up well, but the chairs and matching table will most likely need a stain/oil occasionally to maintain their color. A great choice if you want something a cut above what you usually find at the big box stores!"
2,Lame 1 dimensional graphics,This game has the feel of a quckly produced game that treats handheld games as second class systems. One dimensional graphics and game play. Does not have a 3d feel like lego star wars II. I stopped playing after two or three scenes. I regret buying the game.
5,Great Can Holder,I got this for my husband. He loves it. He says it is nice because it fits his hand. I like it because you can actually wash it easily by hand unlike the foam ones. It is sturdy and very well made. Feels like it will last a long time. Great value!
1,Damage CD due the use ordinary thin letter envelope,Shipping was poorly done that resulted to broken CD case and damage disc. Negligent used of protective bubble wrap for proper care shipping.
1,melodramatic,"I read the first three chapters last night & don't know if I can take any more. Overwrought, melodramatic, and cliqued are the words that come to mind. I want to like this book because I have great interest in Latin America, but it seems like a telenovela. Will it be a waste of time to keep reading?"
1,Walking In Blindness...,I picked up this book in the hope of learning somethinginteresting about the Spanish and Mexican Culture. I was sadly disappointed.All of the people in the story are walking in SPIRITUAL DARKNESS and relying onthemselves to make all the right choices for their lives.There is no looking to The Lord Jesus Christ and asking for his guidence. No wonder their lives are in shambles and everyone is living a LIE!!!These people need a Jesus.
3,It's okay,"This is not a great recording, not even if you are ready to settle for ""light weight"". The singing is good throughout and if you have nothing better to do than spend a few relaxing, mostly enjoyable moments, then this recording will certainly entertain you nicely."
1,i thought this was a journal!,"i thought this was a journal! but it's not, its a book. a regular book about the author's experiences. not what I was looking for."
5,Captivating Narrative,Mrs. Ruiz does a great job of telling the fascinating story of her life.Great applications for all women.
3,Sunpentown Air Conditioner,Every funtion was so good. cooler & heater is very strong. but the leaking water from compressure is big problem.
3,Pretty good for canned!,"I was pleased with the product though it tastes much better than it looks. It's way better than Chef Boyardee's similar pastas such as raviolli and macaroni and beef and if you like the mini-shells pasta as I do is definitely a winner.It's canned so, of course, it can't compare to home-cooked but is pretty good and makes an excellent quick lunch. I occassionally even eat it for supper when I don't feel like cooking or ordering out. I tend to eat more for supper than other meals so will have two with a roll and a glass of milk but it is an enjoyable meal."
5,Got to Move With This One!,Love this CD. This is my workout music. I listen to this when I'm power walking and it really gets me hyped. Have had this for a couple of years and I still listen to it.
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"I bought these to save money and every time me and my friends play, all we do is whine about how stupid these controllers are. buy the real thing, its worth it."
1,Pathetic is a complement!,This is a horrible no-good waste of time controller that does not last long. BUY THE REAL THING!
1,Buy a real one!,"Despite the fact that I am a sucker for special limited edition colors, this type of controller has annoying nubby little knobs and is hard to grasp. The buttons are weird! I would recommend a Special Gold Zelda controller if you want a cool colored controller."
1,FX Texture Dirt,"I have used FX Texture Dirt for several years and its WAS the best product of its kind. I have been buying it at Walgreen for several years, however they have discontinued it. I just bought a case of 6 on line. Apparently FX has changed the formula for Texture Dirt, now it leaves a greasy mess on the hair. I will not reorder this product. I have switched to a another product and I have 5 bottles of Texture Dirt that I guess I will throw away."
2,SEEN IT ALREADY...,"i just happened to be flipping through channels and stopped on BET and noticed MARQUES HOUSTON and OMARION in a movie together, ONCE AGAIN. i didn't realized that i was watching THE SEQUEL to SOMEBODY HELP ME, PART 1. i could have sworn the first was titled, CABIN IN THE WOODS, but anyways. i watched a good 45 min of this movie, and the ACTING was more frightening than the storyline. it was like a VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY BAD version of HOSTEL. i would definitely say that the first is better. this was so low budget."
1,Total Crap,"This has to be worse than the worst movie ever made, if that is possible. I can't believe people wasted money to make this piece of garbage. Poor acting, poor plot and poorly thought out."
2,a bit weak.................,well i gave it 2 stars cuz i actually finished watching it....it wasnt super horrible but it was weak...definitely not as good as the first one....the 2 lead guys in it were fine but the other actors were not so strong.....the acting was a bit remedial at times.....and the writing was a bit off.....sometimes it just didnt fit the scene..many awkward lines.....as for the gore...well not so much but for the low budget they had they made it work.......i did appreciate the twist at the end but due to the weakness of the movie it didnt come off that strong........had potential but just didnt get there....i would say wait & stream it for free
4,"Very good lens, pretty standard use","I like this lens very much. But seems like I always opt for either my 50mm f1.0 or the 21mm f1.4.As a general rule, I find 35mm lenses a bit neither here nor there.Certainly many people still prefer 35mm lens for their general day to day use, and I respect their preference.Is it worth it? Well, if you get a Leica, you should aim for their top lenses anyways, so the pricing question is rather moot. Leica charges a lot for their lenses because they can.Only if you want to buy this lens now, you might as well for the latest, improved lens that they came out with a few months ago.You do not go wrong with either."
4,Worth The Buy,"This single is worth the buy for any Craig David fan. Although it is not as good as the 7 Days or Fill Me In singles, its still a great addition to your CD collection. The single contains new remixes that stray away from Craig David's now-familiar style. The ignorants remix is very nice and is the type of remix that one would enjoy from artist Craig David. Another remix, the Step-Child, was a huge disapointment. The background music was alright, but the song contains no R'n'B, but is entirely rap, and it's not the type of rap that you look forward to listen to. Its more of a childish style. The video for walking away thats available on the CD is nice, and entertaining, but isnt as good as the 7 Days video. On the whole this is a good but not great single, but is still worth having."
1,really not that good,"the recipes in that book are so basic (and simple) that purchasing this book was not the best purchase i have made.He has recipes like Ham, peas, dill. Wow, that is really something, isn't it? NOT!!!Then he lists all the utensils/pots/dry herbs that he has in his kitchen. Who cares?Then he tells stories of how he tried cooking when he was 7 yrs old. Again, who cares? This is not a story telling competition.Another recipe that comes to mind asked for store bought frosting. There many other recipes that called for store bought items (instead of making them himself). If i wanted store bought recipe, i'd read the recipe on the back of the frosting container.I went through the book the other day trying to get as many interesting recipes out of it as i could. Alas, i was able to come up with just 2.I love Dave's show, but this book is very, very basic with not a lot of beef. No pun intended"
5,Great Book,"My son just turned 5 and starts kindergarten in a few months. He loves this book and asks to read it over and over. It's a little long for us to get throught the whole book some nights before bedtime, but it's broken out into 1-2 page chapters and he doesn't seem to mind stopping mid-way. The chapters are educational and fun. I bought a few other kindergarten books with good reviews on Amazon and this has been his favorite. Would be good for both girls and boys."
5,"Uses standard Pinyin, which is great, but also challenging","This book is the only phrase book I've seen that uses standard pinyin. This is good because:1)Standard pinyin is the official standard romanization for Chinese and is used on all signs in China.2)It has the accent marks to indicate the 4 tones (and 1 neutral tone).3)All Chinese people are required to learn Pinyin in school.Pinyin takes a while to read and pronounce properly, so the learning curve on this book might be steeper than other books. (Don't try to read pinyin like English, or no one will have any clue what you're saying!)But if you have any aspirations to learn Chinese correctly, I recommend this book as a good introduction."
4,Preparing for a trip to China,"I bought this book in preparation for our trip to China. It has a lot of useful phrases that can be used in various situations travelers might find themselves in. The text is very small, which makes it compact, but requires the use of reading glasses for many of us over 40! I was dissapointed that there wasn't more vocabulary for navigating airports."
3,Comentario sobre la Edicion en Dvd de El Privilegio de Amar,"Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd, tiene un Buen Resumen con Lo Mas Importante de la Telenovela, es muy Dinamico, Escenas Cortas y Concretas.Me hubiera gustado mucho que en el Final dejaran la Escena en que Mijares Interpreta el Tema Principal de la Novela, pero la sacaron y pusieron otra cancion, la Telenovela Finaliza en el Beso no en los Creditos como en la Transmision Original.Tambien me hubiera gustado que no quitaran el Final de Ana Joaquina, solo dejan hasta la parte que esta en el Hospital y habla con su hijo, Juan de la Cruz, no se ve cuando esta Encerrada en la Carcel y Pagando por todo el Mal que hizo.Sin ser eso, lo demas esta muy bien. Me Gusto Mucho!!!"
4,Muy buena novela,"Muy buen contenido y buenos actores . Tiene mucho suspenso y amor ,, Es una novela interesante y la recomiendo."
5,Cosplay Away!,"I bought these for a cosplay (Lilith Aensland). I haven't quite started making it quite yet, but even if I don't get a chance to, I'm still going to wear them. They fit perfect and they are vibrant in color (red). The packaging is iffy. It's just the shoebox wrapped in brown paper. the box can get a little damaged around the corners, but the shoes are well protected (individaully wrapped in plastic and paper). They're so cute!"
5,Most Excellent,I am really taken by the works of Philp Glass and this CD is one of my favorites. These etudes for piano are simple yet haunting melodies that soothe the soul.
1,First impression of Philip Glass' music,This is my second Philip Glass album. I honestly tried to stick with it. It's like listening to a washing machine hoping that the dryer will contribute something interesting.
1,Amateurish!,"I heard the Etudes live twice played by Dennis Russell Davies and was very excited by them. I then heard Glass perfom some of them live and it wasn't very good, but I still thought when he told me that he was recording them that the record would be great. Imagine my chagrin when I bought the record to hear this inept, amatuer performance!"
4,Piano Etudes....score?,"Does anyone know if the scores for these piano etudes have been published? And if so, where might one find them?"
1,"Yes - very, VERY shabby.","Mr. Glass is simply not much of a composer. He is trite, pretentious and very dull. How people can kid themselves into thinking his music is ""deep"" or ""profound"" is laughable. There is more value and interest and real music in one bar of Charles Ives or J.S. Bach or the Beatles than in Glass's entire output. Sorry, folks, but it's true. It's time to stop kidding yourselves."
5,Turkey & Turkey Hunting,"I had first noticed this mag. at WalMart this past Spring. Couldn't get over how well it was written, how instructive it was, and the right ballance of ads to articles. Walmart only put out the Spring and summer issues. Finally, I decided to get a subscription. I just got the first delivery to my mail box Thanksgiving week. Received the Fall and Winter issues at the same time. What an excellent read! An excellent mag. for the beginner and experienced Turkey hunter. I'm sure I will be rereading them before the Spring season."
5,Great read,This is a great read and a must for anyone that chases thunder chickens. To be any better would be too much to ask
3,What is delivered is not what was pictured.,"The product delivered did not look like the product pictured.The product delivered is the Sweet Leaf Liquid Stevia English Toffee, which is available from Amazon in a two pack for a lower per bottle price. They are identical, even though described somewhat differently. I thought they would be different, and ordered both so I could see which I preferred. (The Amazon sold one looked just like their picture). The only reason for ordering this product would be if you want only one bottle and don't mind the higher per bottle price.The product itself is quite good and I regularly use it in coffee (and was trying to replenish my supply and learn if this product was even better than what I had gotten earlier when purchasing from Amazon). Like others, I believe (based on considerable reading)that the artificial sweeteners have health problems and have decided to pay the extra price for Stevia."
2,Jeremy's parents,I have a 16 year old and thought this would be helpful but it's geared more toward younger children. the book is well written and informative but doesn't help much with teens.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS VIDEO. The quality of this video is that of a high school student. I pre-ordered this video and AM NOW SEEKING A FULL REFUND. The audio is HORRIBLE. The sound mixing is HORRIBLE. The sound quality is as though someone is speaking in a drum, and the next second the helicopter sounds are so loud you have to mute your sound system; and, then the commentary is so low in volume all you hear is static. It is a shame that World Cycling Productions put this on the market. DO NOT BUY IT. I really do not know how to get this thru to you, JUST DON'T BUY IT."
5,a religeous event,"Reading the other comments, I agree they didnt do the best on the sound but in a way the background noise adds atmosphere to the whole event. Its still an awesome event, you get to see a lot more of the countryside nd amazing places they travel through than on the four hour, more uninterupted coverage of crucial stages especially the amazingly scenic mountain stages. its a riveting watch, probably the most action packed of Lances tours. Vinokourov has to be seen to be belived, that boy just doesnt give up attacking. This is a must for any fan of endurance sport. I don't cycle but that doesnt stop its appeal. It transcends beyond just being about cycling, like all endurance sport its about striving and suffering and overcoming"
1,Fell apart after one wash!,"Bought this bra and LOVED it, it fit really well and was very comfortable and really cute. However after i washed it once it fell apart. i don't mean a little but i mean all of the mesh on the entire side and through out one cup has disintegrated, almost as if it was dry rotted. i am really sad about this because i did love the bra, but not worth it."
3,"So, So","This bra is very cute, I got it in the black and pink. With that said, it is not very comfortable, and my breasts pops out of it in a wrong way (I am a 38C) The fit is excellent, only if I am not moving about. This bra should be worn only for **special occasion**"
2,Nice design but not comfertable at all.,"The style of this bra is really nice. But fit is very poor. Mesh like material is very itchy. Can't wear while going out, because it creates wrinkles and bumps visible on tee-shirt. total waste of money."
4,Pretty in pink,"I received this bra and it was so very beautiful. However, I needed a different size. I was not able to get another size since they only offered a refund.The refund was quick and I am happy with the customer service."
5,Love my bra!,"I ordered my bra over the weekend and it arrived yesterday and I am so please. Not only is it sexy, it fits like wow. I don't feel like I am over chesty. I hate that I had to buy 32DD bra, but it is soo sexy I will get over it. I recommend if you are thin like me. I am 5/9 and 123 pounds, and I love this bra. Finally an bra that is not ugly. I will be buying this bra again in the future. Now all I need to find it in the regular stores!"
1,terrible,"terrible.looks cute, but left rash under my arm due to the fabric itching me so terribly. also made my boobs itch and sag because the straps are so long! i'm like dang can i get some real and natural upward support?you know you got the wring bra when you're contemplating getting a boob job. i'm just saying =/"
1,Such a disappointment.,"I have a very hard time finding the right bra. It has to be comfortable, fit right and have padding. My size is a 32D, kinda weird, but it is. I bought the black desire bra, excited I could have one new bra that'll work. As soon as I put it on, the disappointment began.1. Very uncomfortable, very scratchy and digs into my skin.2. Although the straps and all felt right, it did not do its job as a bra.3. Absolutely no padding whatsoever. It had no support and would pretty muchjust be a bra for sex and by that point it would already be off.So as soon as I took it off, I put it back in the box and now plan to return it.If you want comfort, a bra that does its job and support with padding, I would advise against it."
1,Disapointed,This bra was way too small for me. Its not true to its size. I'm a bigger busted woman and Im always having problems finding a comfortable bra that fits me properly. It didnt fit me at all. It looked like I was trying on a B cup bra :(. It was depressing because I thought it was really cute. Plus it is like practically see through :/.
1,Don't buy from IN THE MOOD INTIMATES,"This seller, ""In the Mood Intimates,"" is highly disreputable. I bought a matched bra and panty set, same color, as a gift. The bra was at a great sale price, the matching panty was at full price. The total, in excess of $100, qualified me for a $10 discount and free shipping.Twelve (12) days after receiving my credit card remittance, they shipped me the panty only, with no explanation as to the missing bra. Over the next three days, I left eleven (11) detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates, receiving no response. Finally, another nine (9) days later, I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock, and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty (even though its packaging is unopened) owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile, they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $10 discount.These people are dishonest. Stay away from them."
2,Cute but extremely uncomfortable.,"My girlfriend's exact words: ""I had received this bra last week in the mail.It fit surprisingly well and was very adorable. It was much more see-through than the picture shows... Which was surely not an issue for me.However, it was pretty uncomfortable. The center seam rubbed two particular places in a wrong kind of way...It also left very uncomfortable indents on my sides. I put in the mail the day after I received it.I will admit that I have somewhat sensitive skin (in terms of physical touch) but even so... I'm not sure how anyone could find this to be comfortable.If comfort is not an issue to you, then this is the perfect bra for you."""
4,"Pretty, but not for me","I was looking for a bra to fit me better. I got this one and tried it on as soon as I got it. It's very pretty, but it's a bit scratchy and uncomfortable to wear all day. It doesn't have great support either. Although, I would recomend it for special occasions!"
5,Cute and fits well,"I found this bra to be true to size and even cuter than the picture. As other reviewers have noted, it is more see through than you can tell in the photo. Because of the lacey fabric, it bends a little more to your natural shape so it gives a better fit than some of the demi or padded bras out there. I don't notice any issues with rubbing, though it's not a bra I'd choose to wear for 18 hours straight because I can see how the material might get uncomfortable. I also didn't notice any trouble with the underwire being too high on the sides (sometimes they can rub under your arms, I haven't noticed that with this).Overall, it's not a bra that's designed for all day comfort, it's designed to be sexy, and I think it lives up to that. It looks good, and it fits true to size."
5,one of the best books I ever read as a kid,"This is one of my absolute favorite books from when I was a little girl. My dad used to read it to us at night, and then I reread it when I got older. Very hard to find but worth every penny, this book is BEAUTIFUL and I hope it goes back into print someday."
5,great for ideas and for specific outfitters...needs updating,"this book brings excitement into my life each time I look at it. I use it for ideas about what adventures might interest me, as well as, for specific outfitters. I like the reviews and grading system of the outfitters. I also appreciate the inclusion of price expectations. It was published in 1992 so it is getting dated but still very useful. I logged on hoping for the revised edition only to find that it doesn't exist."
5,The most resourceful book I own,"Even the 1992 addition is still one of my favorite books in my library of over a few thousand books.He is thorough, the graphics & typesetting are excellently done (i.e.. easy to read), he gives price ranges and star ratings, which also help.The resources are abundant, yet not too much to be overwhelming (for us who have a difficult time deciding where to go).Phenomenal book!"
5,great book,"An excellent source for adventure travel with simply amazing photography. Unfortunately, out of date (1992). An apparently planned new release never came out. If anyone hears of a new release, let us know."
3,"Soft, cuddly, but thin for the price","The size says medium, came out to be about 9 months sized. This outfit is very soft and fuzzy, and the color is nice. Also the zipper flap in the front makes for easy access to baby. BUT, the material is quite thin. Found a thicker one for half the price."
3,good light gun for the old xbox system,But the only great game to use this gun is HOD2&3 although I wish it was wireless!Auto reload should be turned OFF when playing HOD but auto fire should be turned on because these are some pain in the butt zombies who take forever to kill off esp when they move super fast.
1,LET DOWN,"LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT, DOES NOT WORK ON A MODERN TV , LCD HD PLASMA , ECT. I GUESS IT IS MY FAULT FOR NOT RESEARCHING THE PRODUCT ENOUGH"
1,don't buy,Tried several times to calibrate the line of sight with the 1st person shooting game and it failed so I gave up on this piece of crap.
1,Squirrel Trap,"This bird feeder is not squirrel proof, it is a squrrel trap. Any squirrel who is unfortunate enough to climb into this bird feeder can not get out without help and will cut it's self up trying. I bought one for my mother she hung it up yesterday and looked out this morning and discovered a squirrel in her squirrel proof bird feeder. It was extreemly hard to remove the squirrel whose hips were scraped up and hung inside the feeder."
5,Great DVD ... guitar in concert,Frank's material lives on. This is such a great show and Dweezil is a fantastic player. I wish I had seen them with Steve Vai live.
5,Cool Music,"I've always liked Zappa but have found it difficult at times to get past his humor. This DVD showcases his music, which, for me, because of the production and the song selections, isn't diminished in any way by Zappa's lyrics, enhanced by excellent mixing and production. I really got into it. The music is all there and is delivered by exemplary musicianship. The video is well done as well, without any silly attempts at ""artfulness"". The sound quality is excellent, as Frank would want it. His son does his dad proud."
5,Dweezil out does his dad.,"A truly incredible concert DVD which rocks much harder than most of the originals. Three and one half hours and only one song I could have done without (the tacky and off color Punky's Whips, which is not one of Frank's bests). This is a must for Zappa fans and a great introduction for those still unfamiliar with his music."
5,zappa plays zappa,"I saw this show in L.A. This is one great band. The musicians in the bandare some of the best in world. If you are into the music of Frank Zappa,or if you just want to learn about his musical legacy, this is a great place to start. The song selections are from all different aspects of Frank's catalog. Dweezil has really stepped up and taken on the role of getting his dads music out there in a manner that it should be, with respect and dedication. This disc is worth owning. GET IT NOW!"
3,Mistitled - use it as a hiking guide,"There is only general info in here for facilities, accomodations and activities other than hiking. The title is deceptive. On the positive side, it has useful maps and data for hikes all of which include a graph showing the altitude change along the path."
5,Wonderful Hiking Guidebook,"This was the perfect hiking guidebook to have along on our recent trip to Glacier National Park. As with her other books, Vicky Spring provides complete, accurate, and helpful reviews of each trail, including stats (length, elevation gain/loss, high point, approx hiking time, season, difficulty, and what USGS map to refer to. In addition, maps and elevation profiles are included for each hike. Wonderful photos by Tom Kirkendall for nearly every hike provide additional information and visual interest. Each section (covering a different area of the Park) begins with recommended ""short hikes"" perfect for those with limited time or energy. Highly recommended."
2,Oi,"This book is a disappointment. While the comments by the publisher on the back suggest that material not covered by other commentators is drawn on, a read of the book simply reveals that the author is drawing on the same works everyone else does. Ultimately, the author's arguments that Babylonian or Egyptian sources are as important to TOlkien's Middle Earth are just plain silly and wishful thinking.The book itself is well described by the author as populist, it is written not to study Tolkien so much as to answer the questions of Internet fandom. While this might appear to be a useful enterprise, generally Internet fandom doesn't usually buy books and study. They check out websites, and this is where most of this book came from in the first place: web site articles that have not passed the muster of a peer review or criticism of other Tolkien fans or Tolkien scholars. It would have benefited greatly from either."
3,Submerged,"It is a good action book - It is fast paced and pretty interesting. It can be kind of weird is parts, but is good.It's filled with suspense - you just can't put the book down untill it's done."
2,"Beautifully sung ... horribly acted, poorly filmed.","Beautifully sung (at least by Kikiteau and Hartelius) ... HORRIBLY acted, and poorly filmed. Sendak's sets are poorly lit, and are either far too good for the production or far too bad for it. The children's chorus has been added to the opening of Act I and the closing of Act II ... and is completely unnecessary and obnoxiously distracting (as are the two pantomime-like costumed cats added throughout). The only somewhat interesting - however unexplained - element that this production adds is an odd link between Gertrud (the Mother) and the Witch. I don't care for this production ... or the translation for that matter (though its sung in its original German with subtitles). Don't bother with this production. I would suggest the Metropolitan Opera performance with Rosalind Elias or the more avant-garde Opera Australian production, both of which are available on video."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Rufferto has a legitimate grievance about not being named as the senior partner, in this title! If you are talking about intelligence, he certainly does, and here he comes into his own. However, he still does not have hands to hold those swords. Hilarious stuff."
4,"Groo, you moron!!","the master of running jokes, mark evanier and sergio aragones are here once again with tdumb, dumb groo tales. you're gonna love them."
4,Great boots,Very stylish and comfortable. Fit true to size. Leather is soft and supple. A steal at this price. (I paid $74.79 for these boots at amazon.)
3,Sound volume problem,"Although the music of Shostakovich is beautiful, it was surprising that Chandos did such a poor job of volume adjustment. It is necessary to readjust the volume of almost every track, and there are 35 of them on the two CDs"
5,thought-provoking,"This is my favorite of all Isobel Kuhn' books. She likens the Lisu tribe people to opals, the stone of fire. As Christians, it is only through brokenness that we can reflect Christ's light as an opal shows the fire in crevices and imperfections of the stone."
3,good content; damaged upon arrival,"The product itself, Biblical Hebrew laminated sheet by zondervan, is fine for content and is a rather useful reference, however, with the new packaging system, the shipping box end was completely open and the laminated sheet was pretty badly bent and corners creased. The product is paid new, but arrived in pretty rough condition. The books managed to survive the trip well enough and were in unmarred condition. the sheet should have been placed separate in box instead of between books of different sizes so corners wouldn't end up bent."
2,Influences by Western Language,"This concept is very good though there is no ""w"" in Biblical Hebrew. That is a Latin, Western influence. This makes MANY areas of this not accurate."
3,Biblical Hebrew laminated sheet,"I found this to be very informative but lacked in some of the translation things you need to be able to use it effectively. It needed more of the basics that unless you were taking or had taken some classes on Hebrew before, you would not be able to get very far with it. Overall it was interesting and informative but lacked some basic things that would help you use it better. Good to get the feel of it but needs more to be able to be really useful."
4,cool stuff,cool stuff.. Thats not a cheating table. You need to know all the rules to go over it and really understand it. Its a great tool for classroom.. Go for it..
4,Essential for the student of Hebrew,"A few oddities and quirks, but overall a great handy reference to keep in the front of your notebook."
5,input,a very informative help for basic study and beyond. to have help with the letter sounds make a great difference.
2,Battery life fade fast,"I bought 3 of these batteries back to 2009. One of them was broken but the seller sent me a replacement fast. It was good for a few months. I was able to talk on the phone for hours. However, after a few months, I can only talk for half a hour. Now, I can barely talk for 10 to 15 minutes."
2,Not as advertised.,"The item I received is not the one advertised, it's not the Lenmar brand by Sharp. It's some generic brand."
2,Please ask before you buy,"I bought this from batterycenter. The company seems to be ecent and helpful. However, I was fooled by the image and the description on the main page. I thought I was getting an original Lenmar for $3.99. Turns out it is a generic Smartbatt. Wish they'd use theat in the product description instead of the Lenmar name and image. I'm keeping the generic battery to avoid going through further hassle. I hope they work."
5,Great batteries!,These batteries were exactly as described. These OEM batteries are the ones you would find at local retailers for twice the price!I revived my favorite phone system with four of these batteries and now the family is also happy.
1,Short lifespan,"After approximately 1 year of use, all three of the Lenmar batteries hold enough charge for about 10 minutes of talk time. The original batteries lasted several years. What a shame the Uniden batteries are so expensive- I can buy a new set of phones for just a little more thna the cost of the 3 replacement batteries!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought four of these on August 1, 2008. The phones that are used the most only have a talk-time of about 10 minutes now and have trouble charging. Even when they were brand new they didn't have the capacity of the original batteries and the reduction in capacity was apparent on almost every call. These are definitely not of the same quality as the OEM battery. I haven't figured out how many of these I can go through to equal the life of the OEM battery, but just the hassle is not worth it. I'm buying better batteries now."
4,Great Deal,"My Dad's old battery would only hold a charge for about 10min., so when we got this one and it held a charge for more than 24 hours he was so proud of the deal we got."
1,Traded one bad battery for another...,"My old Uniden battery was getting up there in years and didn't hold a charge like it used to. So I bought another ""new"" battery to replace the old one. Unfortunately the new battery had even worst battery life then the old battery. Good news is it was sent back and I was quickly refunded."
1,What a Joke!!!,"This battery arrived in unsealed plastic packaging, meaning the battery could be removed and replaced without affecting the packaging at all. Furthermore, the packaging was not form fitting to the battery; it was just floating around inside the package. Furthermore, the plastic itself was broken!Oh, and big surprise, the battery didn't work. At all."
1,battery crap shoot,"First items ever returned to Amazon. Amazon return service is good but batteries are bad.Two batteries would not hold a charge after just 2 weeks. Based on others reviews, this type of battery is a crap shoot at best. Tried ordering the Energizer ERP190GRNE at Batteries.com (through) Amazon, but they were out of stock. I will try them next if the Lenmar replacements fail again."
3,Don't make this your first,"I've listened to this a few times. It's basically David singing with somewhat annoying guitar loops repeating over and over again. The lyrics are kind of cool. If you are really into him, this might be one for you to pick up, but if not, try ""gone to earth"" or ""dead bees"" first."
3,Listen first...,"With ""approaching silence"" this is one of the most bizarre record of Sylvian's career.You should listen before the decision of buying it...Paulo Domingos, Portugal"
4,This ones hard to peg,"I have been a huge fan of David Sylvian going back to the late 70's - this guy has been on the fringe since his Japan days - he has a very loyal following and they have been rewarded with some of the best music recorded in the last 20 years. With Blemish, he has changed gears yet again - this is a minimalist album - a concept album - many parts are his voice and a guitar or keyboard - there are not frills - no overproduction - no beatsOnly artists with pure talent, balls and trust in their fanbase would produce this kind of album. It took me a few listens to 'get it'. Too be honest, I was expecting something along the lines of 'Dead Bees' and I was a little surprised - shocked actually.This won't attract new fans from what I gather, it will turn off some Sylvian fans unfortunately. I on the other hand found this album enormously rewarding over time. Can't imagine what the next project will be like."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a long-time fan of David Sylvian, and am disappointed with this album. It's basically poems set to a dissonant soundtrack. I prefer Sylvian compositions with more rhythm and beat to them."
2,Approach with caution,"In my opinion, one would be hard pressed to find much of beauty here, or even of interest... Listen to clips, at least, before spending good money. Although perhaps beside the point, a good alternative is The Nine Horses project, featuring Sylvian, Jansen, Sakamoto and others."
2,"Um, was this David practicing and someone happened to record","(it?)I have many of David and Japan's albums, but this thinly composed album is repetitive, boring and annoying. I think there were some hidden tracks too, but I just wanted the album to be over. You are better off with ""Dead Bees on a Cake"" , ""Secrets of the Beehive"" or any bee related titled album of his!"
2,A Different Cup of Tea,"I've been listening to David religiously since Brilliant Trees, developing a deep appreciation for his artistry, his attention to emotional detail, and his ability to capture the intangible. Clearly David explores the audio landscape like a painter approaches a canvas. However, this album marks a huge departure from all of his previous work in that it is so stark and devoid of rhythm, with only minimally implied harmonies. If what you love about David Sylvian is the lyric and his voice, intimate, up-front and center, then you may love this. I continue to listen to this album wishing that he had explored these themes with the interesting cast of musicians and rich layers of rhythm, harmony and counterpoint that I've come to expect from David's work."
2,WON'T ORDER AGAIN!,This stuff does NOT absorb into my skin. It just lays there on top. Had to wipe it off to put my make up on.
2,Too sensitive for me,"Unfortunately, this brand is too aggressive for my skin. I've tried this product and another one, but both times I break out. I find the products to be well made, despite the rash, and I would keep buying if I could."
5,Derm e rocks!,I absolutely love this product and all Derma e products! This is a great price and fast shipping. I recommend their Hyaluronic eye cream as well as their new Hyaluronic face wash and their Hyaluronic moisturizing face mist! If you have oily skin and want moisture without oil this is the way to go as well as all natural ingredients! I'm a fan of this product for life!
5,It really works at smoothing your wrinkles,"I love this product. I was of course skeptical that this would do anything other than moisturize my skin, but it does much more. I use this for my forehead, my neck and my laugh lines. The lines seem to dissapear from my forehead and my laugh lines are a lot less noticeable. It softens the depth of my neck lines and tightens the skin. Really, my skin seems smoother and plumper. Its inexpensive and it works."
1,wouldnt know,"perhaps i would be able to tell you how i liked this product if it had been sent to me, i attempted to order it from DIRECT SUPER CENTER out of Arizona, but they sent me a different type of derma e cream, so i just kept it not wanting the hassle of a return, then i attempted to once again order the correct cream and direct super center struck again and sent me the wrong product again, this time a pimple cream...do not order from them be very careful"
3,Too light for dry skin,"This product is too light for dry skin. It feels like it needs to be re-applied after 2-3 minutes. For people with more oil in their skin, this would probably work well."
1,Now we can all sing hick tractor songs,Wow I've always wanted to sing songs about my poor mother and my three legged dawg.
2,poor design,Everything is fine about this product except that the latching mechanism is not the same as the stock version. This means you have to make your own modifications so that it will fit properly. This means cutting parts out of the dash.
3,i guess good deal for the money,"needs more r&d for proper fit and finish, clips don't match factory installment. the clips supplied by metra dont lock into dash panel unless broken"
2,Cheaply made.,Tabs would not hold and snapped off when I tried to spread them out. The defrost button has never worked. Poor fit required trimming of the dash.
3,Forget the Sample...,"Erendira IkikunariThey offer a free sample of the DVD - pretty useless - you get to see the credits and the titles, a meager sample of the sound track and almost no feel for the film itself. Don't waste your time with the sample. I'm ordering the actual film, when I have a chance to actually watch it - an actual review.John D. Berry, Native Studies Librarian, U.C. Berkeley"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Dodgy relative deals.Back from Germania, Falco again has to deal with trouble that is literally much closer to home, or at least closer to family. His male relatives have more than a touch of the Arthur Daley about them, and it seems, in this particular antique business, somethign valuable has gone missing.Amusing investigations and the odd bad joke follow. Definitely a good one."
2,Didn't enjoy this one so much,I found the story hard to get into and the various plot masinations to be a struggle. I ddin't enjoy this nearly as much as the previous one.
3,"Great Pictures, but flimsy","I love the pictures... I just wish they were a little more durable so I could use them more regularly with my 15 month old son. He just enjoys trying to bend and crinkle paper too much, so he ends up mangling these cards, if left to play with them unsupervised.For an older child, or one not as bent on destruction, or a younger baby to look at, the pictures are awesome and colorful. Great depictions of animals!"
4,Cute cards,Some of these cards have soft fabrics and textures but some are just shiny or sparkle. The overall format is good for interaction and most words are useful for learning at age 16+ months.
4,Great for animal obsessed children,"Beautiful animal picture flashcards. Pictures are actual photos of the animals. Daughter got them for 2nd birthday, loved them. Only gave for stars because I feel they could have been a little sturdier. She has bent several cards which causes a crease in the picture where the bend is, so they are not indestructible."
5,A Wonderful Addition to Our Flashcard Collection,"Beautiful, actual pictures of animals, from animals you'd expect to find among children's flashcards--such as the butterfly and the horse--to more uncommon animals--such as the otter and the dragonfly. The cards are big and not flimsy, although I think they can be slightly sturdier. They will bend if you let your child run around with one."
4,The pictures are brilliant!,"I love these cards! The pictures are great and the information on the back is wonderful. I only wish that the author had put the names of the animals in different languages as she did on the Language Discovery Cards. One small point, I am not sure why she has some broad category animals, such as ""dog"" and then more specific ones, such as a particular type of fish."
4,Great introduction,We started these with our daughter at age 1. Within a week or two she had them down. The info on the back is interesting. I learned a lot. You will get more out of your zoo trips with these because the kids already know the animal names.
2,Cards bend easily!,"I read many reviews, and thought these cards would hold up against my 18 month old son. He has bent alot of these. He isn't that interested in them after bending. I feel like if they were book board (like I thought) maybe it would hold his interest. Not durable at all, I promise."
5,"It can be clean, you just need to be smarter than the amp","For those saying it will not do clean are idiots, Use the neck pickup and turn the volume down. It does a clean sound very well."
5,How do you spell AWESOME!!!,"Seriously folks, this amp has what it takes, I'm betting Frank Zappa knew that too. Just one volume knob, no effects...spells awesome. If you seriously want to be a better guitar player than this will hep you get there. One needs to learn how to control their sound through the guitar and not effects. Turn the guitar's volume up and walla.... overdrive and distortion. Turn the volume on the guitar down and open the the cabinet and clean is clean. If Angus Young can get that legendary tone from a guitar and an amp then this is what you want to practice with. A++"
5,No wonder they have such a great reputation . . . .,This little amp sounds much bigger with nice tones and dynamics.I've tried some of the other little practice amps that sound like transitor radios. The Pignose is a real guitar amp.I highly recommend this for a small carry-along amp for small rehearsals or vacation.
5,Awesome little amp,"I just needed something small for practice at home, and this is perfect. You can roll back your volume and get a clean chime or crank it for classic heavy fuzz. Although it is made to be battery operated, I recommend getting the power adaptor. Preamp output sounds great, too!"
1,not accept,"i ordered this cd twice from differnt sellers and the first was an accept greatest hits and the second was a blues tribute to led zeppelin,there is no such album of accept doing led zeppelin songs."
5,fantastic book,what a wonderful book..this is the first of Frank Asch's books that i read. now i am a fan and am looking forward to collecting all of the other ones that he has written.
5,Well done for Chris Hawkins,"For a beginner this is one of the best books for Cubase. I saw one or twp of the others, but I am so happy I bought this one. It show you step by step what to do, with pictures and throug out the book it gives you tips and special notes. Thank you for making life easier, now I can start produce music and not try to figure out what to do with all the features."
5,Beautiful Brown,When Loving Care was discontinued I tried Clairol Beautiful and am very pleased with it. Will continue to use it for the color and texture of the coloring.
2,Garbage,I switch around my set up alot I got this switcher because it was a 4 way in put and I have 4 things to input. Problems kept comming up and It did work however the picture was blurry on the edges. I had to position it when it did work so the video signals would go through.Finally after trying to plug in a new cable it just stopped outputting video and nothing I could do would fix it.It's complete garbage and now I have no idea what switcher I need.
2,"HD yes, but poor signal handling","This thing works as advertised, yes. However, if you have an HD signal fed into a monitor that does not correct the signal automatically, it is junk. That is, if you see an explosion or something bright on screen, the monitor will blink out for a second before coming back. Thats particularly bad if you are playing video games. At any rate, it does do what it is supposed to do, but not well, and not consistently."
2,"Fine, unless you have a Wii.","Seller shipped fast, and the price is great.. 5 stars for them.Giving 2.5 stars for the item itself. It works fine, unless you have a Wii. It works with my (older) DVD player and my Tivo.When I connect my Wii, it gets very cloudy with streaks going across the screen... making it unusable with my Wii.So, without a Wii, I would give it 4 stars... it just gets a 2.5 for not working with a Wii. Might not be fair if the Wii is the problem, but this item isn't usable for me if it can't support a gaming system. Not worth the effort to return over fifteen smackers, so I'll keep it.. and maybe find another use for it."
1,Junk,"This product was complete junk. It doesn't work the way it is supposed to, and when it DOES work, Half the screen was black. Bigger than I expected it to be and completely not worth the money I paid for it."
1,Disapointing,"I smoke meats (pork, beef, fowl) frequently. Unfortunately, local merchants only carry hickory and mesquite wood. I recently cured my first fresh ham, and, wanting a sweeter smoke, purchased these chips. I was very disappointed. The chips are small, and are consumed quickly, requiring feeding approximately every ten minutes. I consumed the entire box in three hours, and resorted to hickory chunks--my favorite wood--for the final hour.Overall, these chips, while providing the desired sweet smoke, are, by comparison with local sources, pricey, and insufficient for the serious smoker. I pay $6.00 for three pounds of hickory chunks at the local Walmart, and get 3-4 four hour smokes from one purchase. I won't purchase again."
4,He Knows His Stuff,"I admit I am not a celebrity worshipper, but I thought I would try his chips, since I was searching for a good wood smoking combination.I was really pleasantly surprised by Raichlen. His chips are a nice blend of strong and mild woods....perfect for the Masterbuilt electric smoker.....a little chips goes a long way.For my Weber Smoky Mountain though, I would never use these chips....too small....I would go with my own CHUNKS.....hickory, oak, etc.But I like what he has put together."
5,Excellent Read,"John Douglas makes it easy to read about these sensitive topics without losing his audience, like many other authors of this genre. I would purchase more books by John Douglas in the future."
1,Had to force myself to finish this book,"This book's cover reads ""...penetrates the minds and motives of the most terrifying serial killers."" In some places it lives up to this theme but for the most part it doesn't. This book is 400+ pages long and over 200 are spent covering the life story of one victim and the aftermath her family faced along with the killer's trail. The story is very uneventful and drawn out. The rest of the book reads at a similar pace. The author has written many books on the subject of the criminal mind and at this point I think he's spread himself thin."
1,Way too egotistical for my taste!,"It is difficult to get through this book, mailnly because John Douglas seems to spend more time praising himself than actually providing the reader with interesting and unbiased information. Contrary to what Douglas may think, there are other profilers out there with just as much expertise whose books are much more fascinating to read. I suggest that you read one of them instead."
3,It gets boring just reading up on cases,"If you like reading real life murder stories you will like this. I just bored reading on and on and on about each serial killer.It does contain some good information. Maybe be good for a policeman, someone who specialises in this sort of work or some keen muder reader. I found it boring."
5,The book that makes you sleep with the lights on,"It is hard to imagine that fellow human beings can become as monsterous as Douglas tells us. Douglas gives the reader a chance to see just how dangerous your ""average"" next door neighbor can be. Better double check those doors and windows tonight!"
4,Interesting and insightful,Opens your eyes to those around you. Read it and watch others. Protect your family!
3,"interesting, but the back cover is deceptive","Douglas expands on Mindhunter, but covers some old ground again. He has a pedantic writing style that labours on detail, but I still found myself engrossed in what he had to say. Don't buy the book if you want profiles of the Unabomber, John Lennon's murderer, or Waco. They are not even mentioned! (this was just the publishers trying to make the book sell better)."
3,Mind Hunter all over again.,"After reading Douglas' incredible ""Mind Hunter"" I could not wait to read this follow-up. Unfortunately, Douglas seems to reiterate the same warnings and sentiments he expressed in ""Mind Hunter."" While reading this book I had the feeling that Mr. Douglas did not have enough new material to write about so he relied on some past material from his popular earlier book to fill in the gaps. ""Journey into Darkness"" delves too deep into the past of the victims and gives a lot of information about the victims' family that doesn't fit into a book concentrated on serial killers. The best thing about ""Mind Hunter"" was the pace at which Mr. Douglas gave pertinent victim information and background and shifted to the crime itself. This enabled him to deal with many rivoting cases. This quality was lacking in Journey into Darkness."
3,Getting Redundant,"If you've already read Mindhunter, you needn't bother with Journey. It is essentially the same stuff, with just enough words switched around to justify a new title. If you haven't read either Mindhunter or Journey, flip a coin."
3,Douglas the Egotist,"After reading an enjoying John Douglas' 'Mindhunter', i purchased 'Journey into Darkness' thinking it would be equally as good. I was totally disappointed. He turns his sucess into a platform for capital punishment and calls for a review of the judicial appeals process. He takes a particularly brutal right wing view and seems to overlook the basic principles of democracy in a modern society, and waffles on about one particular murder and the subsequent actions of the victims family. While being a heart wrenching story, does John Douglas consider her murder worse than the others he proiles? His prose is that of a total egotist. While the stories he tells are interesting, be prepared to be constantly reminded of his talent. Only for the most patient of souls"
2,Dissapointing,"I was very interested in this book because of the posibilty of learning about famous cases and how authorities deal with the offenders.However i was very disspointed with the author.First the author just ""talks too much"".By this, i mean that he just talks and talks endlessly about cases without really telling us the ""science "" behind it.In other words i was interested in the problems faced by the police, how to deal with them,going deep into the mind of the offender.BUt sometimes the author just talks about things that were not really that important.I found myself trying to finish the book quickly, especially the parts relating to the young woman who was abducted in the army base which it seemed to me, the author was more interested in giving us his opinion that actual science.Again, very dissapointing work."
2,He exaggerates his involvement in the investigations,"Mr. Douglas, hmmm. Are you at it again? The homicides are real. The real stories are told in a well written manner. The degree to which Mr. Douglas ""infuses"" himself in those investigations is quite ""unreal"". Mr. Douglas forgets that there are those who have contacts within the realm of law enforcement investigators, including those who have come across Mr. Douglas. AND including those investigators who were involved in an investigation (or two, or three, ...) ,which Mr. Douglas mentions his involvement, who NEVER HEARD of Mr. Douglas!!!!!! A few contacts and calls will confirm this to anyone who cares to take the time to do so. The author of ""Stolen Valor"" (Burkett) should do a ""profile"" of Mr. John Douglas..... regards.."
5,Educational and Engaging Read,"This book, like Mindhunter, held my interest from beginning to end. It is fascinating to learn about the science of behavior and how the FBI is using it to hunt down and trap the ""bad guys"". Do yourself a favor and read these books; you'll never look at crime or criminals the same way. Full of real life instances and families. While extremely engaging, it was also educational."
4,Examining the mind of a killer,"""Journey into Darkness"" gives a harrowing portrait of the brutality of murder. The book includes several stories of actual criminal cases involving serial killers, rapists, pedophiles, etc. With his years of experience in the FBI, Douglas has developed the ability to predict the profile of a killer with an excellent degree of accuracy. He is straightforward and honest about his opinions on crime and our system of justice. This is good reading material, but be forewarned: with its graphic explanations and disturbing nature, this book is not intended for the weak of heart."
4,"Re-edits, but not really new info","Long-time fans (or daytime viewers) will recognize these as re-edits of older shows. They're still worth a look, especially if you have a remodel in your future."
1,Vendor unreliable,"I'd give zero stars for this vendor ""Forcheapsoutlet"".I can't actually rate this product, because it hasn't arrived. The contact information given for this vendor is invalid. The phone number is out of service and no one responds to the email I've sent.I hope Amazon discontinues associating with this vendor. I will be filing a claim with Amazon for a refund."
5,Love Triumphs,"In Found: Love, Donna Wright continues to spin stories that tickle your funnybone and remind you of a simpler time when neighbors were, as in this story, either pretty darn appealing or pretty darn cranky! But, all in all, it's a fun book and I highly recommend it."
5,Possibly will be considered the great Australian novel.,"Death of a River Guide consists of the meditations of a drowning man. As he reflects on his wasted life and troubled family, he begins to understand his past. The novel's broad sweep encompasses a lot of the darker parts of Australia's history, but it's really of general interest and deserves more recognition in North America. Flanagan is concerned with universal themes of original sin, forgiveness and, in the end, redemption. He presents these themes in the context of the life, times and death of an individual. And he tells the story with such a restrained yet effective narrative technique. It's worth your time, if you can find a copy."
3,Rivals Madden,"I owned this game when it first came out for the original Xbox and fell in love right away. Of course I played the Madden and NCAA football series but after countless hours in all game modes on both games, I grew tired of the same old thing.That is where this game stands out, every week, and almost every day there is a new task or goal to meet and players adjust season to season, almost week to week. I recomend this game to its succesor (NFL Head Coach 09) because this original edition is more streamline and simple, yet deep.In conlcusion, if you want a game that you can get lost in for hours and hours, this is it. The only reason it is not my favorite game is because I am a first person shooter lover (Halo, Call of duty, etc). This game is perfect for the most novice gamer all the way to the ones who are addicted. Enjoy"
2,Ditto the last review- just glad I sold it!,"Yes, this game is very boring. The thing that bugged me the most was the bad simulating, like the draft. Reggie Bush falls to number 20? To me, EA just wanted to get this out as soon as possible so they could attract avid Madden players without interfering with the release date of college football 2007 or madden 2007. It seems like they could have used an extra 3 months to update the rosters (so my seahawks can get Julian Petersen!) and also to make the coach's interactions a little more realistic.Plus, I couldn't stand that every time I simmed a few days I had to stare at Bill Cowher's ugly mug until it was done. As a diehard Seahawks fan, I don't think I can ever root for the Steelers again :-)"
2,DON'T BOTHER!!,Im running windows xp(pro upgrade) MAN did it mess up my system!! it is NOT compatible with windows xp!
2,"Arm is OK, however, is not complete as advertised!","The arm is as shown -- however, this item does not include the flange/escutcheon, as advertised. Both the photo and the description state that the product contains the flange. It in the description as a "" the ""Rain Drop Style Shower Head FLANGE Included"", which is the small, $1.50 collar that comes on the arm, but that should be color-matched to the arm. It is pictured on the box, listed on the box, pictured on Amazon, and listed on the Amazon site.Seller FindingKing did not address the concern."
3,Good - - But Left Me Hanging,"Alexandra St. Clair was in love with her college sweetheart Christopher Mason. One day Christopher decides they need a vacation, he makes plans for them to have a wonderful ski weekend. Alexandra's father didn't like Christopher at all and told them both. During their weekend Alexandra had a tragic accident. From that point her father tries to destroy her relationship with Christopher.Alex's father made me angry. He could plainly see that his daughter was hurt by the breakup. He was a selfish man and had secrets of his own.I was disappointed with this book because some of the questions were not answered. It was kind of like a movie cliffhanger with no sequel. For example, once Alexandra found out her father sabatoged her relationship with Christopher, she never confronts him. Now I am wondering if Ms. Wilson-Harris created a sequel to answer these questions."
4,Fast shipment.,my husband and I love westerns. this is an interesting dvd of famous outlaws and gunslingers. Thanks for the speedy shipment
5,DVD's about gunslingers,"Fast, Fast delivery. In great shape and a great bargain. Looking forward to watching and then researching for true or false."
2,WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP!,"This video series is extremely boring and does not even approach the excitement of other series on the West, such as the outstanding A&E series, The Real West, narrated by Kenny Rogers. The monotone narration adds to the assorted problems with the series, not the least of which are (1) it unapologetically uses extensive clips from old Westerns and (2) it is shot in video instead of film, leaving a uninspiring, one-dimension aspect to the videos. Don't waste your money!"
5,works as suspected,"works like it is supposed to, really does not look bad, really happy with the results, amazon.com ships quickly with adequate packaging to keep from damaging products as always.only con I had were the instructions are vague, however it is not too difficult to figure out"
4,Worked great,"Everything worked out great, installed in a 01 escape, shows a little of the black plate but not a big deal."
2,You're kidding.... RIGHT?,"This thing is very comfortable, for the week or so that it works! Like some of the other reviewers, and other people I know that own these, the Z button is a BIG problem. After the week or so that I said it will work, the Z button caves in, and there is no real way to get it out. I tried taking it apart. and it didn't really help. The rest of the controller, however, was better than the original. But many games can't be played (at least to their fullest) without the Z button! It might be more comfortable and accessible, but it's still a horrible product! What a joke. InterAct should be ashamed. FOR GOD SAKES, BUY THE REAL CONTROLLER!!!"
3,"comfortable, but breaks easily","I have had one of these in gray. It is much more comfortable than the regular ones because you have more freedom of movement having only the middle ""stick"". Plus, the buttons are a little closer to each other and the L and R buttons are more easily accessible.However, I would recommend purchasing a different brand; the Z button is a real problem. It stopped working after about a month, so I opened it up to fix it - part of the button itself broke, being the... plastic that it is. I used super glue to fix it, closed it up, and it worked for a few more days. Then it broke again, and I can't even get it open because the screws stripped so easily. This, of course, takes a lot of function out of many games, and is now just trash."
3,BREAKABLE,"I like the feel and look of this more than the controller by nintendo but this will break a lot you will be able to fix it sometimes currently, my joysticks is breaken but I can still play alright. If you do not have young sibling or you are very careful go for this over nintendo othrwise go nintendo."
1,Low price very low quality,"I bought 3 of these controllers (1 blue, 1 black, 1 green.) The top decal that says the brand name broke off first on all of them but it was no problem, i just glued it back on. About a week later the ""Z"" button jammed and despite numerous attempts to fix it i couldn't.On the plus side my friend has has a grey one for about 3 years now and it still works. The downside is it is ugly as hell. The plusses are that they are cheap compared to the Nintendo brand controller, dont get this save up the 10+ dollars and the Nintendo brand will last you longer without any problems, mine hasen't."
2,Don't buy it,"I have used two different controllers just like this one and the joystick always goes bad after about two months, the cord comes out, and they have sticky buttons. They look cool, but they're not worth buying."
2,Probably just bad luck...,"I tried to install this part on a 2001 Honda Passport LX. The two pieces seperated while I was trying to work it into the grommet. It was probably just bad luck, but make sure you are pushing straight down. Don't twist it in at all like did, I think that's what got me. Going to try one with a metal body to replace this broken one."
1,This TV is just plain BAD,"I have this TV now for a bit over 18 months. My TV needs a manual now to get it turned on. First press the on button (nothing will happen). Wait 5 second and manually turn of the TV at the bottom of the unit. Wait another 5 secs and turn it on. Press the ON button again. Repeat until you get a picture (usually around 3 - 4 times). When I have a picture is is an extremely bad quility. Repeat all steps until Picture is clear (about 10 times).This TV I did buy in Aruba by Price Smart. Some of my friend also did buy this TV at the same time and also they have the same problems like I have.After investigating online it seems that the power supply is the problem, and that this is very very normal for this TV.Akai will not help as it is no longer in warranty, and getting it fixed is about $350.DO NOT BUY THIS TV."
3,Look elsewhere,After owning this for 1 year now....I'm having major problems with it powering on after it's off for any length of time.I use it primarily as a monitor.
1,POOR PRODUCT,"THE AKAI TV IS BAD NEWS! POWER SUPPLY PROBLEM STARTED 13 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE - OUT OF WARRANTY! CALLED LOCAL REPAIR SHOP, WAS ADVISEDTHE NEEDED POWER SUPPLY IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. FOUND ONE FOR $189 -COST TO INSTALL: $150. TV ONLY COST $499! WILL NOT BUY ANYTHINGFROM AKAI EVER AGAIN."
4,SCI-FI classic. Enjoyed many years ago and still worth a re-visit.,E.E. Smith is dated when read in this century but still points the way that future Science Fiction as different from Fantasy would look. I miss this stye as it is nearly absent from shelves now.
3,Galaxy Primes,I always felt when i read this as a teanager that there should be more to the story. I still loved it and a lot of E. E. Smith's works.
3,Super Reader,"E. E. Doc Smith's Galaxy Primes are people with advanced mental abilities. In other words, they have psionic abilities, and the Primes are Psionic Primes.The main group in this book do not quite get along as well as the fraternal types in the Galactic Patrol. Still fun though, space battles, mind blasting, all that good stuff."
3,classic sci fii,"i first read this over 40 years ago, it is a very easy and enjoyable read.but pales when compared to the lensmen and skylark stories which are the true classics by this master writer"
4,GOOD UPBEAT COUNTRY/SOUTHERN ROCK ALBUM,"Confederate Railroad always seem to put out a good upbeat album and on this one they pay tribute to some of their heroes like Johnny Paycheck, Keith Whitley, Alan Jackson, Hank Williams Jr., David Allen Coe, Billy Joe Shaver, Waylon Jennings, Charlie Daniels, Dave Loggins, Joe Diffie, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Although the originals are more Country sounding Confederate Railroad sure add a nice Southern Rock flavor to these classics. I gave this 4 stars because I felt that they have sounded better (vocally) in the past. Instrumentally though they have never sounded better. Pick up a copy if you enjoy a good rockin' country album."
5,Excellent quality!,It is a really good product! I would buy it once more. It is definetly more than i expected. .
5,Fun and poignant!,"One cannot help but be moved by this little book of various sayings of and articles about Satchel Paige. Yet this is one of the most delightful reads I have experienced in quite a while. David Sterry and Arielle Eckstut have put together a collection of witicisms and rare articles that will delight the baseball fan and history buff.Beautifully illustrated with vintage photographs and pictures, this book is a gem. A reader will learn about the spirit of a man who looked Jim Crow in the face and won!"
3,Skip this If You Plan to Order the Complete Series!,"As the title suggests, if you plan to order the complete series, Don't buy this particular title. The entire DVD is taken from the series itself. You can imagine my frustration when I looked at the episode list on both packages and realized I'd bought essentially the same thing. Guess I should have researched better before buying, but hope this saves someone else the waste of money."
5,LOVE this DVD box set!!,"I first saw this series in 2002 when I was a 10 year old and I LOVED it! It is full of action and fun! When I saw this DVD box set and the low price, I just HAD to buy it! Watching this again with my nephew brings back lots of great memories from my childhood! The price is awesome! Very low and perfect for those who love to watch cartoons from thier childhood again and dont have much free money to spend! A great bargain!"
4,Interesting,Bought this as a gift and the recipient was very happy to get it. Said it contained some information he needed for his research.
3,It was very interesting and accurate.,I thought the book was very accurate and interesting. I really enjoyed it and would recommend this book to others. I thought Egginton did a fantastic job of relaying the events to the reader.
1,POOR,"When I had received this ring, I took a quick look at it. First thing I noticed was that it was ALOT smaller than what the picture makes you think it is. But I gave it to my girlfriend hoping she will still like it. She did but there was something wrong. TWO DIAMONDS WERE MISSING!!! So I returned asking a refund. Now customer service will not refund me or give me the ring back!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!! DONT BUY!!!!!!!"
4,Black Diamond Ring,"The ring was very nice and I was pleased. It is a little smaller than shown in the picture, though. After following the sizing chart, it fit good and did not need sizing. The ring was definitely worth the price paid."
2,Lost diamonds!,"This ring is gorgeous, and I enjoyed it for a few months. However, after only occasional wear, I've lost two diamonds from the shoulder of the ring. I am very disappointed, as this was one of my favorite rings, and now, with the missing stones, it's too shabby to wear."
3,looks better online,"The ring was missing 2 small diamonds when I got it. It looks a lot better and bigger online, and while it is cute in person, be careful for the smaller diamonds falling out randomly."
3,Diamond appeared bigger on pictures,"We could not ask the more for this price, but the diamond appeared bigger on Amazon's ad. The ring size is one order bigger so we returned to Amazon. Amazon refunded the price less shipping, thank Amazon for us to try."
1,I saw a 1 carat ring I liked better,I saw a 1 carat you carried that was much prettier for less than dbl the cost. I simply prefer the 1 carat
4,Just my size,The ring just arrived - about a week after I ordered it. It is the perfect size for me - perfect size diamonds and perfect size ring. I love it! It sparkles and shines and is just what I expected. There are some flaws in the black diamond that you can see on the inside of the stone - but I don't mind because that makes it apparent that the stone is not an onyx or other dark stone. The holdings do not look completely sturdy - so I will have to see how well it holds up to wear. But it is a beautiful ring.
4,Books from the past,It was nice to revisit this series. I read all of them when they first came out. It is amazing how concepts have changed since these books were written!
3,Good Lyrics,"Nas is on-point with his lyrics but the beats aren't that good. It seems as if his focus was to push units, so I guess he accomplished that. I have been a Nas fan since I heard his verse on Main Source's ""live at the BBQ"". Nas needs Primo and Large Professor on the production. They bring out the best in him. I guess his selection of ""hot"" producers keeps him relevant in today's ""dead hip-hop"" market. How about going the indie route and give your long-time fans the exclusive Nas & Primo record you've been promising for the last couple of years? Oh yeah, I was real disapponted to hear the same beat that was used for Thief's theme (which is a far better song) used for Hip-hop is dead. Nas is my second favorite lyricist of all time (Rakim #1), but using the same beat again is weak."
5,Hip-Hop Is Dead,"Great album by Nas. Stepped it up alot since his last album, and this was well worth the wait. Good to see Hip Hop Is Dead performing well on BillBoard too and everyone talking about it in the media. One of the best of '06 go cop it!TOP TRACKSHustlersBlack RepublicanHip-Hop Is DeadLet There Be LightCan't Forget About You"
5,Hip-Hop is saved for the time being!,Nas is the 2nd best lyricist of all time (Right behind Rakim) and he doesn't disappoint in this album. This album is a must for any Nas fan.
5,Nas is back with a banger!,"I thought Nas wish finished after I listened to ""Street's Disciple"". However, this album has successfully restored my faith in Nas's lyrical capabilities and choice in producers to handle his albums.I'm not gonna waste too much time reviewing the album, since there have been so many other more in depth and informative reviews written on this great album.Just know it's some of Nas's best work and he's not afraid to speak his mind on this mostly garbage state that Hip-Hop is currently in.Buy it."
4,Hip-Hop's Revival,Nowadays Hip-Hop is the most ridiculous genre out there. Most of the songs in the radio are senseless and have the lamest lyrics I have heard. Thankfully rappers like Nas come in to rescue Hip-Hop from the terrible trend it has being going though. This CD has real lyrics not just some trashy lyrics with a nice beat. For true Hip-Hop fans this CD is a definate must.
3,What is it??,"I finally bought Nas' album after contemplating between new releases by Jay-Z, 2Pac, Young Jeezy, Snoop, and a slug of other well knowners. The reason for my puchase is cuz Nas is a true story-teller. I'm not convinced his true abilities came through on this album, although ""blunt ashes"" is my favorite as far. I'm sure a few more listens to the album will have me yearnin for more and soon I'll come to the notion that this IS one of Nas's best. Next to It Was Written and Stillmatic of course, which are his supreme, imo. 'Still Dreamin' stands out as well with the 15th track with The Game, takin a close third. Overall not superb to Nas standards, other than the concept of ""hip hop is dead"" bein the topic of 2/3 of the tracks! Why a concept album from an atrist who has written and told us more about every other relevant concept other than the state of rap, in our times. Im not sure maybe Nastradamus is just as good?!"
2,Letdown,"Nas is most def. a top MC in the rap game today but this release seemed rush and if your a fan of his previous work such as Illmatic (a classic) your not going to be impressed that much by this album. The lack of good beats on this album really shows just like most of Nas's other work in the past, he uses the same beat from a previous cd on this cd as well. Still there are some good tracks on this such as Blunt Ashes, worth a listen I guess."
3,Is my disc messed up?,"I just bought this CD, and I have the explicit version, but the song Hip Hop is dead is edited. Is it like that on everyone's CD? All my other songs are explicit except that one."
3,Dissappointing,"Maybe because I expected so much or because I loved his past albums, I found this CD, Hip Hop Is Dead as a whole dissapointing. There are a few worth while tracks. But the irony is that while bemoaning the death of Hip Hop (he is right) half his tracks are the very type of songs that have cause hip hop to die.Blatherings about the Hood and killing people he doesn't know are just tired and played out. You would think with such an arduous task of reviving Hip Hop you would bring your game... NaS falls far short.If you like NaS by the CD, but if you want to hear people actually reviving Hip Hop, skill this one."
2,What?,"who is nas to say hip-hop is dead? illmatic is one the best albums of all time, i admit that. even years later stillmatic was pretty good too. but what gives nas the credibility to say that hip hop is dead? its not like he is ACTUALLY god's son. He might not like to new hip hop but a lot of people do.on top of all that, i like nas. this album isn't that bad either. but he shouldn't start bashing all the new artists. especially the south. i think he's just jealous cuz he's not on top anymore. it's a shame but his swagger has gone down over the years. don't hate the new guys nas, you'll have your place in rap music, there's enough room for everyone."
1,"If hip hop wasn't dead before, it is now","The only track worth listening is ""Hip-hop is dead"" which is a recycled beat off of the last album and produced by number one hip hop sell-out Will I Am. For all that NAS is trying to do, he's as guilty of killing hip hop as anyone. The rest of the album sounds like he jacked beats from his old boy AZ. Sorry NAS, love you boy, but maybe you shouldn't have doubled up the last album and made two classics instead."
1,Just Stop Already,"This is by far Nas's Worst albmu. The production is bootay and he needs to stop. Nas had 2 really good albums, (Illmatic,It was written) He had another one which was decent but as far as this album goes I wouldnt bump it if you paid me. It sounds like he picked all of his beats in one session at the studio and made this album in a few hours. The name of the album just tops it off as well ""Hip Hop is Dead"" If you are going to name an album that it should be like the second coming to hip hop. Instead it's just wake beats with boring rhymes. Hip Hop is not dead but as far as Nas goes I think he might have just killed it. For him at leat."
1,Install kit did not fit,"The kit did not fit my 1998 Ford Expedition. The kit would snap into place, but when I tried to place the trim cover back on the dash, the kit would protrude too much from the dash."
5,Perfect Fit every time with Metra,This is the second vehicle I have put a Metra kit in and I'm still impressed. Just follow the directions and it is pretty hard to screw it up. They do a great job of fitting items and I will continue to use them in the future. I used this in a 1997 Ford F-150.
2,"This book had familiar stories,","but coming from a polygamist background myself, I see that the author has mixed up and disstorted a lot of facts. One fact that is kept very quiet is that Mr. Llewellyn was for a number of years a member of the apostolic united bretheren, a polygamist group located in Bluffdale, UT. Also, he only left after being rebuffed while trying to court a second wife. His story sure has changed!! I was born in Colorado City and have friends and family in 3 different polygamist groups and know a lot of the true stories. It is true that the Kingston group and the Colorado CIty bunch engage in forced marriages, and incest..."
4,A lot of great info on Lucifer and Venus,"I really liked this book. First, my main gripe. Aside from the errors in editing. The book never footnotes where it got the information! Using this text in a scholarly fashion is nigh impossible when the author never cites his sources. I never heard of the name Lumiel in connection to Lucifer and there's no information to support the link.That said, the book does have tremendous amounts of information. I don't always agree with everything the author says (such as linking the Horned God to Lucifer) but it does have nice obscure facts, such as the Venusian name of Earendil and comments on Dame Venus (would have enjoyed more of that). All in all it is a good read. Just be cautious in making assertions with this book as it's on shaky ground in the academic department."
2,Don't pay $200+ for this book!,"Don't believe the 2nd-market seller theives! Don't pay $200+ for this book! It IS NOT out-of-print, and can be ordered directly from the publisher at [...] for about $25 in U.S. Currency!! Be a seeker, not a sucker!"
5,"Last, and funniest, seasons of The Cosby Show","I ordered this set after growing tired of trying to track them down on YouTube. The Cosby Show is a quality show all-around, but I enjoy these seasons the best. They're just really funny. The addition of Pam, Lance, Charmaine & their friends help with that, as well the inclusion of the community center Theo was at. Those characters add something fresh to the show, because at that point, I find most of the Cosby kids, except for Theo, to be kind of annoying (not sure if that was the effect the writers were going for). The storyline with Dabnis, Vanessa's fiance, was good too. It's worth it for those episodes, the one where Rudy and her friends try to sneak into a club, and, of course, the series finale."
1,Show is great but don't buy the version from Firstlook studios,I love the Cosby show and iuts awesome. The First Look studios did a terrible job with the DVD. Please buy another studios version.
1,This is NOT for the 1.8T engine.,"If your car is turbocharged, it needs the following part number: 57-0282.Amazon is incredibly dishonest about this and in a time crunch sent me the wrong piece. Additionally, the product box arrived damaged and the Filter looks to be bent. If you're going to install a K&N; air filter, do yourself a favor and don't buy from Amazon."
5,Rome Total War- what a great and in-depth game!,"If you're looking for a realistic and in depth war/strategy game then look no further! If you have a little patience and want to immerse yourself into the Roman War era then this is the game for you. Not an easy game at first, but unlike anything else I have ever played. Nothing is more fun than building an immense army and then slaughtering the enemy from a massive attack on all sides- then chasing down and butchering the last remnants of your foe in order to send a clear message of fear to all those who oppose you!"
5,Great.,"RTW Gold Edition is a great gaming experiance. With epic battles and great graphics it depicts the rise of Rome. With its expansion it delivers an awe inspiring invasion of Barbarians and the fall of Rome. Overall a great gaem, and it got here before it was supposed to !"
2,Rome: Total War will crash.,"I seem to have the same experience as others. You can play for awhile but at some point it will crash. I was several hundred turns into the game when it crashed the game, I went to my last save point and it continues to crash at the same point. This means you cannot continue your game any further. So it is a fun game to play while you can, at some point though you will be unable to continue your game which is quite frustrating."
4,Great Download,"Good game and very easy to download. Takes a bit of a long time to download but that is kind of to be expected. Game is still a little glitchy but I had another hard copy of the game before this one and it had the same problems so it is probably in the actual game, the glitches are very minor anyway. Otherwise great strategy game and I love it."
2,Just alright,"This is a great tactical strategy game, but the graphics and the gameplay leave a bit to be desired. Its reasonably fun and (right now) reasonably priced."
5,awesome game won't regret it,absolutely love to play this game all the time. recently purchased it through the recommendations for me through amazon. really wasn't interested in the type of game being that i typically prefer civil war genre. on a gut feeling i bought the game and have not stopped playing it since. love how you can personalize your armies and also have a hand in the development of your factions civilization. highly reccomend this game for all fans of war and strategy games.
4,Awesome Game,This games is very fun and realistic. It is awesome playing a battle and just playing it in general. The only bad side is that the graphics are kind of bad.
2,"Clunky Interface, slow development","I tried to get into this, but the interface and game rules make it very difficult. I was completely surprised at how non-intuitive it was and how slow, even on a dual core laptop with separate video card. Anyway: after only a few trials, I gave up."
1,did not work,I had a computer wiz look at the game and he couldn't fix it.I am not going to buy any downloads from amazon anymore.
3,Rome,It took a long time to download. It may have been faster to go to the store for purchase. I don't feel it's user friendly . Tried playing it but can't get past first turn. I don't know what I'm doing. Probably easy for some one who has games this types of games b4.
5,Epic!,"This is an older game.. but considering its price and playability... Its a win-win. This game is Epic from the civilization feel of the strategic map to the 3-d battleground similar to age of empires, this game has it all!"
5,One of the Best Strategy Games,What a great game. If you are into strategy games this is a must. The mix of turn based and RTS components helps to make this a complete game. Lots of content - I would highly recommend it. The biggest problem is tearing yourself away from the computer.
1,wont work,it took me forever too download this. it finally got done after 8 hours then said file corrupted please download again like wtf dont by this peice of crap
1,So far...,"As of right now, it is missing the disc vital to even start the download, Disc 1. With that being said I can't play any of the content without that disc. It's a bummer and As I speak I am trying to get the seller to refund the game or even my purchase. But besides all of that, I will write a review if all goes well."
2,"umm, not what i expected","i was looking for a game similar to age of empires when i came across this but its war based only. just sending in troops to fight, Also complicated at points. good luck."
1,Bad game.,"It's as simple as that. I know there're good reviews all over for it, but for me, it didn't make the cut. It feels like it was made at the transition between dinky Caesar city-sim games and the first of the Civilization series. Maybe I'm not too tolerant of oldies I simply hadn't grown up with, but this game seems overwhelmingly awful. Battle controls are difficult and restrictive, graphics are moderately-pleasing but unnecessary extravagant in the tactical map and very sub-par in the info boxes.The game offers no tutorial, crashes often, has extremely few playable factions, uninteresting play options and awkward turns. Knights of Honor, very much like this game in design, is way better. For whatever other elements you're seeking out of a medieval strategy game, consult the other reviews - but for me, use to higher-end games - this barely kept my interest from the start."
5,best pc game of all time!,I grew up liking and fantasizing about this time period so when I first saw this game for my pc I bought it and played it for hours upon hours a day. after owning it for a couple years I sold it and haven't played it for 3 years. I saw it on amazon as a download and decided to buy it because I really missed playing the game. I know play it a few hours at a time but not per day! it is still one of the best pc games I have ever played
2,Rating based on game stability,I am a huge fan of the total war series and I love their gameplay which I feel is worth 5 stars on its own. However when I downloaded the version from the internet for windows 7 the game closes out around 100 years into the campaigns on both games. I am very unhappy I cannot see the campaigns to their end and I currently cannot find any patch to fix this! This is kinda steering me away from wanting to download games from amazon unless they can fix the stability of their games.
5,Great World (or Italy) Domination Game,If you enjoy the idea of building an empire and micromanaging (if you so desire) all the cities in your empire this is the game for you. I bought it on the heels of Medieval Total War II and in a lot of ways I like the Rome game better. I seemed to have less trouble picking up the play of this game (though it may be that my experience with Med Total War II helped out). If you buy it I hope you enjoy it as much as I have and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
5,This game never gets old,"I've been playing this game since 2005 and it's still just as fun as it was when I first bought it. And with the mods available out there, i.e., Rome: Total Realism, Roma Surrectum I & II, it's like the game keeps being remade over and over, and it gets cooler and cooler each time. If you like turn based games or RTS games, and are a fan of the time period, you won't be disappointed. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Rome 2: Total War. They remade Medieval and Shogun, why not Rome?"
4,Awesome game,good game and easy to use download with no issues. Price is also very cheap would definitely buy amazon digital again.
2,Keeps Crashing,Rome total war games are great but in all honesty this thing keeps crashing on me.. 4 times since I downloaded the game.This really shouldn't happen it's quite upsetting. It's a no buy in my book.
4,Excellent game with modest system requirements,"I bought Medieval II: Total War, which is a great game but won't run on my laptop. I then tried Medieval: Total War, but it was a little too outdated and somewhat simplistic. Rome: Total war has almost all of the great features of version II, but will run on older machines. It's quite fun, with a lot of historical information as well."
4,Pretty good.,"This game is pretty good I guess. I enjoyed it but if you are planning to buy it keep the following in mind.1. Be prepared to put a lot of time into this game2. This game requires a lot of micro management (building up towns, maintaining diplomatic relations, improving trade and production)3. If you are looking for an action game, try a different one. The battles are outstanding and there is an option to play ""Historical Battles"" (like a quick action function) but the main focus of the game is to create an Empire and the battle aspect seems to be only a fraction of the entire gameplay.Very well put together. I highly recommend it."
4,awesome!!!,I love the game for the fact that it allows me to use my brain and challenges me in tactical situations. A battle can come out many ways and it does not matter if you have Superior numbers you can still lose. With the battle map options you ca tailor everything so if used right you can defeat a superior force with tactics and options available to you. The game challenged me. Can't wait for Rome Total War 2.
4,Excellent strategy game,This game is a lot of fun and you can certainly play it for many hours. I do get a bit tired of constantly fighting rebels and revolts but an excellent upgrade from previous games in the series.
4,Battles Are a Thing of Beauty,"The battlemaps in this game are truly a thing of beauty, from the interesting scenery, to the pageantry of the colorful massed formations, to the riveting, brutal action of the hand-to-hand engagements when viewed from close up. I confess to mostly having played Barbarian Invasion, as I find that period of history most interesting. The campaign play has a lot of compromises to allow for playability, but I enjoy especially keeping track of my 'family', and its additions and tragedies along the way. It would be nice if there were more detail to go with this feature, and a way to keep track of individual character's accomplishments (and failures) that is easily accessible, but overall, my complaints are far outweighed by the enjoyment this game has provided.If I could make one more suggestion, it would be immensely fun if players could be members of the same faction, allowing for some interesting intrigue in seeking favor and the throne."
4,A fun and informative guide to the language of sex.,"This book is a fun and informative collection of words and phrases dealing with sex in the English language. In addition to collecting wild and raucous terms for everything sexual under the sun, it includes historical and cultural contexts as well as a number of archival ""dirty"" photographs that ultimately make the book a brilliant diversion perfect for cocktail-party chatter. I really enjoyed it."
2,A little old and dated,I found the thesaurus a little old and dated as far as terms went. It seemed more like it was written back in early 40s and 50s; even the pictures were dated. I found a few terms that I felt could be used for today's contemporary writing; but overall no one talks like that any more (IMO). I was a little disappointed considering the good reviews this book had received. I wish there had been some sort of date on it for when it was last published or edited. It could use a serious update if you're a writer of contemporary pieces.
2,The Bald Headed Hermit and the Artichoke: An Erotic Thesaurus,Very very crude. Useless to me. I was thinking erotic romance not porn. Was good for a few laughs though.
1,INAPPROPRIATE FOR LITTLE ONES,"Today, March 12, 2005 we checked out this book from our public library. My 3 yr old was looking at it in the car when my older child said ""Mom, is that book really appropriate for her?"" I looked back and my 3 yr old was staring with her eyes wide at a picture of an ax in the head of a dragon and blood dripping. Very inappropriate. 2 thumbs down."
1,At That Price...,"Even though I think that it might be interesting to read some of Patton's poetry, at that price, I believe I'll wait for the paperback."
4,Fascinating & Informative!,"This was a truly fascinating book! Each plant as well as each animal mentioned had a color photograph beside the description. The book was divided into two sections. Section one covered the distribution, appearance and habitat while section two was devoted to toxins, symptoms and treatments.The table of contents was of particular interest to me. It had page numbers side by side that told where to find information in part one and part two both.I was surprised at some of the plants that were toxic as well as some of the symptoms. Many of these plants are common houseplants. This book also gives beneficial uses of these plants.This is definitely a book worth adding to your book shelf if for no other reason than having the symptoms and the treatments of toxic plants and animals close at hand."
5,A great resource,"I found this a fascinating read. The author provides a section on the toxic element, symptoms, and treatment of a wide range of plants and animals. For me, the book also serves to provide a list of plants that can be used to discourage nosy neighbors and their irritating little pets. What a great resource!"
1,pointless and inefficient,"The wipes are warmed only for about 2 seconds after pulling it out. As soon as you begin wiping, they're just as cold as they would have been without the warmer. Also, the cord is inconvenient if you need to change the baby in another room because you can't just take the box of wipes with you (also inconvenient if you don't have a plug located by your diaper changing station). The plug is super bulky and gets extremely warm, which made me a little nervous. After a few weeks of using the product, the lid stopped closing all the way. So when I would pull a wipe out, the whole lid would bob up. Also, this resulted in the top several wipes getting dried out (and the middle wipes, when i pulled from there, were not even warm). I wish I could have gotten a refund on this product, but when I took it back to target I found that they had discontinued selling the product and wouldn't re-stock it. Don't waste your money!"
1,"Lid won't stay closed, wipes dry out","I can't believe more people aren't complaining about the lid! When we first got it, we would have to close it several times before it would stay shut. After about one month of using it, it won't close at all.Even when we could close it, the wipes would get dried out, and we'd end up throwing away half of what we put in there.Now we don't use any wipe warmer, and guess what? My son doesn't seem to notice any difference. Save your money."
3,warmer review,I bought this warmer for my newborn. I thought this will help me but wipes get dried and they get cold as soon as you take out from warmer. wont be warm enough till it reaches to your baby's butt. I went all reviews for other warmers too. but I bought this one. for me it didnt work. its just sitting at my home. its useless. its better not to buy any warmer because i found reviews of other warmers similar to this.I would never recommand this product to anybody else.
5,4.5 years and going strong!,"I got this wipes warmer for my first son, who is 4 1/2. My 2nd son was born before my first was potty-trained. So we have used this wipes warmer every day for 4 1/2 years. I love it. It still works just like new, is easy to add wipes, I've even been able to add them with one hand mid-diaper change. Even if you don't necessarily need the ""Warm"" feature, it would be great to just hold your wipes. Providing a sturdy place for them where you can grab one and the container doesn't lift up, making it hard to pull one out. I would buy another in a heartbeat."
1,Hot Plug,The plug at the wall got very hot...I googled it and found that this is a very common problem with this product. I emailed the manufacturer. They instructed me to mail the product back and they would replace the item under the warranty. I had to pay shipping and it took 2 weeks to receive the replacement. When the replacement product arrived I plugged it in...within 24 hours the plug was super hot again. I emailed the manufacturer again and did not hear back (it has now been a week waiting for reply). Save yourself the trouble and by a different brand. My baby did like the warm wipes and I had less trouble getting him to sleep with middle of the night changes for the few days I was able to use the warmer.
3,"Hmm, warmer dries wiles a little and wastes elec....is it necessary?","Got this after friend said had to get a wipes warmer but didn't use the warmer function much. Felt like it was wasting electricity and drying out wipes. So we mostly use it unplugged (detaches from most of cord/plug). It is a very nice case for wipes otherwise and works as advertised. It's heavy so it stays nicely in place when you're trying to pull a wipe out one handed. Pull out wipe first and hold in hand a little to warm up as getting ready for diaper change helps. We also live in warm climate so that helps. If you live in colder climate/house, a warmer might be more useful."
2,disappointed,"I like the way it's made, but disappointed that the wipes are about room temperature. A warmer needs to get the wipes almost hot in order to have a nicely warmed wipe by the time it reaches the baby's bottom. I'm sure the manufacturers can fix this issue...If there are smart, they will read these reviews!"
1,Dries Wipes Out!,This thing sucked all the liquid out of the wipes within a couple days. The wipes are bone dry now. I am not impressed.
2,Meh.,"It warms wipes OK if it's full, but as your wipes get used it dries them out. The ""night-light"" is a joke, it's super dim."
2,Power Problem,"When this warmer worked it kept the wipes warm fine, but the power cord had two sections that had to be plugged together. The connection was constantly too loose, so every time we needed wipes we found that it had become unplugged. We ended up tossing this and buying a different warmer."
1,Not as goo as I expected,"I purchased this warmer because of the good reviews, but I think I may have been better off with the Prince Lionheart Model. This warmer constantly dries the wipes on top. I tried pouring a little water, but still dry. Pour more water, and they're soaking wet. My sister has the Prince Lionheart warmer with the Ever-Fresh Pillow that goes on the bottom of the warmer and that combination works great. I may have to try the Pillow in my warmer to see if that helps. It's too bad the Pillow cost 50% of the cost of the wipe warmer. Why can't they just make one that works without having to buy addition parts to make it work??"
3,wipe warmer,"I thought this wipe warmer would be a great thing to have for my newborn seeing how he hates getting his diaper changed with cold wipes, but it turned out to be an ok product. Even though it works the way it should and it heats the wipes up to a safe temperature, after a while it would dry the wipes out from the heat. I found this to be pretty frustrating because I don't like for things to go waste; I guess I'll just have to add water to it next time."
4,munchkin warmer,"It helps a lot to keep the wipe warm, that way the baby feels comfortable unlike the crying you get when you use a cold wipe."
3,Not sure if this is a necessary item,It seems kind of silly now that I got it...I'm not even sure if it really works any more than just having your wipes somewhere room temperature
3,Not a necessity but nice to have,"It does warm up the wipes nicely. Although they cool down fast once they are pulled out, they are still warmer than they are at room temperature. Unfortunately, if you always want to use a warm wipe, you need to buy one for every room you keep wipes. Not a necessity, but makes it nice to use for a nighttime change when the air temp is colder."
4,so far so good !,"Looks great, matches with both boys and girls room ! So far it works great as long as you are clean out the water every time you refill ! Warms up the top wipeys just enough !"
4,Baby loves it!,Sure wish I had this product when my son - who is an adult now - was a baby. My Grandson likes it....and it's very convenient to have around.
4,Good Item,"Very good item, it is exactly what I was looking for, useful and good size because you can put it in a small spaces"
1,Wipes cool quickly after removal,"I should have expected this, but the wipes cool very quickly after removing from the warmer so we just unplugged it since it uses energy with no benefit."
5,Love. It.,I received one from my sister as a gift and it is perfect for the middle of the night diaper changes. My baby used to flinch when the ice cold wipe touches her butt but now it's so nice for her. My husband didn't want this item because he thought it was frivolous but now he loves it too. This is a great investment for baby.
2,Not warm enough,Munchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer did not meet my needs. The wipes are not warm enough and as I take them out the cool down in 2 seconds. Not a helpful product.
5,6 months later with no issues,"Before I rate the review the product, let me first say how awesome the customer service was. My package got lost and amazon investigated and found that UPS was at fault. They delivered me a replacement overnight.This warmer has been nothing short of awesome. When my baby was a newborn, he swould scream when a wipe touched his bottom. This warmer immediately remedied that problem. It warms fresh wipes fast as well. I haven't had a problem with wipes drying (except when my husband leaves the lid open). I think it will dry out thin cheap wipes though. We use huggies one and done....."
1,Drys out,"When I purchased this product, I was so excited because I thought it would be great for my daughter. But after setting it up, and filling the dispenser with water, I came back in a couple of hours and the water was already empty. I figured it may have just been that I did something wrong. So I reread the directions and found I hadn't made any mistakes. I tried a couple more times but came back and each time the water would aready have been used up and one time I left it over night and went to change my daughter in the morning and the wipes were completly brown and dry. I'm not sure if my product was defective."
3,"Bad design, but better than not having one","Pros:-It's nice to have wipes (I put cloth wipes) anytime you want. My baby likes it warm.Cons:-It's really a bad design, I gotta say. Like other people have already described, the heating panel is located on the top. So you need to pile up your wipes very high. My baby poops once a day after he reaches 4 weeks old (and also many babies don't poop so many times a day). So who needs to put tons of wipe in the warmer when it will get dried eventually. They should redesign it better...-The price is too high for its quality and design. That's why I rated 3 stars.Advice:-I recommend people to get this warmer at a consignment store or the local craigslist. I got it only for $6. Many people are selling it only $5 in my area. I wouldn't pay $20-25 for this product...But again, I love my purchase! This is better than having nothing."
2,Cheap,"Ive had this warmer for almost 2 years and have hated it the whole time! It was fine when my daughter was a small infant. The first time she kicked it tho at about 4 months, the top broke because its just held on by a TINY piece of plastic. So now i take it off every time i get wipes. Also, overnight, the top wipe will dry out. For something that you use 10 times a day-it is very frustrating to work with."
5,Couldn't Be Happier,"We researched wipe warmers a few months ago and settled on the Munchkin Warm Glob Wipe Warmer. We have had no problem with the wipes turning dark or drying out. The glow light is not bright, but that is the point. The lid stays closed--if you forget to put flip the closures, I could see how the wipes would dry out. Great product!"
5,We love it !!!!,"We love this product. It put a stop to our little girl crying everytime we changed her diaper. She is now 14 months and she still loves it. In great contrast to other warmers that we tried, this one keeps the wipes nice and moist. Wonderful buy :)"
2,Wipe Warmer,"I disliked this warmer because it dried out the wipes. The warmer also seemed to stay too hot. The machine I received may have been faulty, but either way I would not recommend this warmer."
4,Good product,Works really well and with little babies its definitely worth spending the 20 bucks on. I would definitely recommend this.
5,Wish I had had this when my twins were born...,"...that was about a century ago, but I remember waking them up when changing diapers using cold wipes. I've given this as a baby gift several times, and the parents have found them very useful."
4,Good warmer,"I was told not to waste money on a warmer but my newborn screamed at each changing in the cold winter air with a cold wipe. The warmer works well and the wipes stay wet with the addition of some water. My only complaint is that the top most wipe, sticking out of the top, isn't usually warm. The one under it is though and at least the chill is taken out of the top one. The light isn't bright enough for night changings, but overall this was worth the $ and has stopped the crying during changings."
3,Good for the money.,I got one of these for my 18 month old because I was worried about the wipes being too cold for him. The prodcut heats the wipes up fast and overall works well. The only two issues (which I am sure alppy to most wipe warmers) is it can be a little drying to the wipe and once the wipe is removed it doesn't stay warm for very long so you better be ready to wipe!
1,Dries out the wipes,My review is pretty straight forward. The wipes dry out and they aren't very warm either. I stopped using it after only 3 days.
2,it's just a box for wipes,"the problem with the product is that it takes to long for it to warm up the wipes, as all parents know it's unpredictable when you will be needing them and this thing takes up to 10 to 15 min to warm up. i just can't wait that long to change my baby and i also can't have it plugged and running all day long,"
1,Not Warm at ALL!!!,"Okay so if anybody is buying this for a non-baby DO NOT BUY THIS!!! The wipes are not warm at all, they are just barely less cold than the wipes out of the bag. HORRIBLE PRODUCT that I am returning!"
1,DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID,THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET. IT IS NOT A WARMER - IT IS A WIPE DRYER. I PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT AND BOY! IS MY FACE RED!!! IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN IT A MINUS FIVE STAR RATING I WOULD HAVE.
1,Poor quality - now it's broken,"Poor quality item. After a few months of use, the plastic lid broke at the point that holds the blue top in place. Now our wipes dry out, the lid regularly falls off, and the product has become a general hassle to use. I'm now trying to go through the process of getting it replaced by Munchkin, but they require sending it back and then waiting weeks for a replacement...probably more time, effort, and shipping costs than the product is worth.My biggest regret is that since buying mine, I've given several of these as gifts to other new parents. POOR QUALITY. Look elsewhere."
1,Leaks!,"After about 4 weeks of use the warmer began to leak around the blue plastic in front. Also, it doesn't have a convenient on/off switch."
4,Simple and efficient,"People finding that this Wipe Warmer dries the wipes must be either forgetting to close the lid, or forgetting to use wipes for quite a while. The wipes I use, in this product, are damp and warm, just so. It makes the changing experience a non-issue with my newborn. The only caveat is that the ""glow"" feature is rather useless, since it is not enough light to let you change the baby. I use a LED light for this."
4,Good Warmer,"I like this warmer. we have used is since my son was born, hes now 15 months. and yes if you have a fresh stack of wipes and you leave it on over night, they will dry out the top 4 or so, but overall it does what it is intended to do. also if the wipes fall down in it, or you have to push them down so your son doesnt empty it one by one like a kleenex box, they are easily retreived without opening the unit. if it quick working tomorrow i would replace it with the same one."
1,dries out your wipes!,"i actually returned this item because it dried out all the wipes. it was very annoying. and when i returned it to target, they told me it was being recalled. they didnt say why. so i would not recommend it."
2,"Eh, more like a wipes drier-outer.","This did function as it was supposed to - it warmed the wipes. But also it dried them out and ended up being something else we had to plug in. We used it about 3 weeks. It was a gift.If you are intent on having warm wipes, this will do the trick. If you are unsure if you need it, you probably don't. We sure didn't."
5,Excellent design and function,"It works. We've had it for a couple of weeks and we're very pleased. Wiping a newborn in the middle of the night with a cold wipe wasn't helping our lack of sleep. One minor thing, I wish we could turn the amber-on light off, but other than that, it is perfect. At first I confused the warm feeling of the wipe for being dry so I placed clear food storage wrap over the plastic top of the warmer. No moisture collected on the plastic film. The bottom wipes are not dried out or discolored. If anything changes, I'll update the review.--UPDATE---Baby is nearly 9 months old and this is still a great wipe warmer. The rubber-like material that helps separate wipes as you extract them ripped a couple of months ago, but it still functions fairly well. Would buy again."
1,save your money,this system only tends to heat a couple of wipes at a time. i returned it after 3 days of use
3,Adequate,"After using a Dex Baby wipe warmer for two years, we thought we would try a different product (out of curiousity) for our second child and went with Munchkin. Comparing these two brands, we discovered the following flaws with Munchkin brand:1)The wipes on top dry out quickly, even after adding water.2) The rubber ""teeth"" don't do a good job of separating the wipes with each pull, sometimes requiring you to use a second hand to pull them apart. Frustrating, because your other hand is typically preoccupied.3) The thing is huge!! Takes up so much space on the changing table. Dex baby is upright and takes up far less space.So our conclusion is that this is a decent product (it warms wipes like it claims), but some of our dissatisfaction with it would compel us to recommend a different warmer. You get what you pay for. Just a few more bucks could get you a nicer warmer."
4,"Doesn't fit in any diaper organizer, but works great","I ordered two of these and they both work great. If you're low on wipes, the last few will get super wet. If the warmer is full, the top wipes will dry out. You can add a little water to avoid this. The light that goes on is not bright enough to see what's going on in the middle of the night, but it's better than nothing. It is quite large and will not fit on any type of diaper organizer, but I don't think any of the wipe warmers will. If you're looking to save money, this is definitely an item you don't need. My son was fine whether the wipes were warm or cold.If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com. You'll get the lowdown on what you really need and what you could save to buy later or avoid completely."
1,Not Acceptable!,Munchkin didn't give us a warm glow...the lid to the warmer stopped closing/latching after just a few days. Wipeys easily dried out quickly and we found ourselves spending almost as much time caring for our wipey warmer as we did our newborn. Now after about 2 months the product doesn't even warm our wipeys! Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
3,It is a nice product.,"I bought this warmer because my baby hates cold wipes on her behind. The warmer serves its purpose. However, in my opinion, the wipes do not get warm enough and only works great when there are stacks of wipes in the container. The wipes on top also dry out very easily as a result of which i have had to re-wet them with tap water. Overall, it is an OK product."
5,Works great!,I have been using this since April and I have yet to see a wipe turn brown as some of the other reviews say. Baby no longer jumps from a cold wipe touching her behind. :-) That used to always wake her up in the middle of the night when I had to change her. I buy the refills that come in big bags and those wipes always seem to come folded so they pop up easiy from the wipe warmer. I highly recommend this product.
2,left me cold,"i didn't have any issues with this warmer getting mildew or drying out the wipes as some of the other reviewers. however, i still had a couple of complaints. for one, the wipes did not 'pop out' effectively so i would have to open the lid every time to get a wipe. and if it did, i would get a long chain of wipes and have to shove the extras back into the hole. secondly, the disposable wipes did not hold the warmth so by the time it touches my baby's bottom, it's already cold. i could get past the inconvenience of the first part if it did what it's suppose to do. you might have better luck using cloth wipes, but i doubt it - the warmer simply needs to heat at a higher temperature to offset how quickly the heat dissipates. this was a product i thought i just had to have for my nursery, but it was totally unnecessary. save your money for something more useful."
2,Dried wipes,Dried out the wipes even when following directions as far as water. I have 4 boys and can not afford to just throw out wipes when the warmer decides to dry them out. Returned to amazon for refund
4,Good product,"I originally bought the Lionheart from Target as I had good luck with that brand with my other 3 children. It didn't go well so I purchased this. The night light on it is fabulous for middle of the night changing without waking baby all the way. The light on it (not the night light) is a little too bright for me, I like the baby's room free from any distractions.The warmer is great, no drying out, but I add water because I like the wipes to be a little more moist.The only down side, and isn't really much of one, is that it doesn't hold much so I am refilling it frequently, but that's probably why the wipes do not dry out."
1,Did not work,"Did not heat up wipes. Considering it is a 'wipe warmer', there's not much more to say. I'll try another brand."
3,OK but not as good as I expected,"Warms just 1-2 wipes at the top, and as soon as you take out they are cold again. I stopped using it anyway."
3,Yo Yo Yo Yo!,This is an amazing workbook ..only if you know how to use it.. I suggest you not to buy old books because they are used and filled up most of the time..ThanksMoazzam
3,Venus Is Very Down To Earth,"Talk about being one of the people! Venus definitely appears to be. She talks like someone who truly built her business off of her kitchen table.Never does she try to impress readers with a large vocabulary. Venuss does quite the opposite and cuts through the chase all the while giving examples and real life scenarios to readers.I would recommend this book more to beginners, though even experienced network marketers will pull out some inspiration and a few techniques.Hey Venus, ""How's that kitchen table these days?"""
4,answers some great questions,What is great about Jo Frost is that she always says you need to base your decisions on your families needs - she does not preach 1 answer as a final all
3,Informative,"A good book, goes right along with what her tv show and other book talks about. Not sure it was as informative as I was hoping it would be, I liked her other book better, but it was still good."
4,descent advice,"this book contains alot of basics but, also some good tips I could put to use. It's for various age groups. All and all it contains some descent advice."
1,She Know's Crap,This book was a waste of time. People think she's the expert but in actuality she's just parroting every other child raiser. She's a total Hack.
4,Great handbook!,"Like the way this book is laid out, easy to find just what you need. Great suggestions for dealing with difficult children, strong willed children."
3,Decent book,Don't know if you really need to buy this book. Her other books are much better and it all pretty much has the same information inside. Just buy one book at a time and see if you need anymore advice before buying others.Good Luck
5,WONDERFUL,"I just ordered my second copy! I bought it back in 2006, when it came out. I was a single mom, and this book was a life-saver. My son is now an amazing 7-year-old, and I'm trying to get his 2-year-old little brother on the right track :-"
3,"Good, practical advice","If you like the Supernanny series on TV, and have had some luck using the Naughty Step at home, then you may find this interesting and useful. Jo uses a Q&A format to provide approaches to deal with many of the problems we parents run into with our young kids. Within the chapters the organization is a little hard to follow, and she seems to want to label each answer as a technique (""Little Chef Technique"", ""Elevenish-Get-Up-to-Pee Technique""). But by paging through the book ahead of time, and using the index for specific problems, my wife and I have gotten a lot of use out of this book in parenting our wonderful if headstrong little daughter."
3,Good book,This book had more of what i wanted to know and she answers questions so I liked that. If you need that little extra help with knowing how to handle when your kids act up this book could help you.
2,Not true.,"This book had A LOT of fiction information in it. I would usually rate this book as a -1,000, but Hanson is in it, what can I say?"
3,Facts & Fiction,"Although I am a big Hanson fan and wish I could give this book a perfect 10 I found some of the info untrue. On the back book of the cover it asks...'What is Zac's favorite restraunt?' The answer on the back of the book says 'Rex's Boneless Chicken'. Then, why in an interview at Rick Dee's did the Hanson brothers say themselves that the restraunt is 'OK' and that they've only eaten there a 'few times'. If the author did research he would have found out that about 1/3 of the book is untrue."
5,"An extremely relevant, current, must-read for all Americans","This book is an eye-opener. Everyone in America should read this short book to understand what is happening in Iraq, the long history of Western intervention in the region, and the dangerous situation into which the Bush administration is hearding this country.This book helped me cut through all the propaganda and rhetoric the current administration --and the local media-- has been feeding us for months.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make up his/her own mind in an informed manner, and feels uneasy about the way in which ""Dubya"" has been haranguing Americans and turning world sympathy into antipathy towards this great country."
5,William Rivers Pitt writes like no other,"I found this book intriguing and informative. From a reader who is not well informed on the subject matter, this book allowed me to understand more about nuclear weapons and Iraq's use of them.READ IT TODAY"
2,Glorified magazine article,"This 'book' is essentially a magazine length interview with Scott Ritter. Scott is intelligent and experienced, but he also displays moments of illogic and his own version of spin doctoring.Save your money, most of this book could probably be found on the internet in interviews with Ritter."
1,Very biased and full of disinformation,"I have followed Pitt's previous works and read many interviews with inspector Ritter, so I eagerly anticipated this book. However many times it contradicts itself and tries to pass opinion off as fact. The facts are few and far between, and many of the arguments leave out points. It could have been presented so much better, but instead leaves the reader feeling cheated."
2,Very Old And Disappointing!,"DVD was much older than what was let on. It doesn't even cover many of our current combat helicopters. The current combat helicopters that it does cover, it shows them in their very early stages. Some of the footage was decent, but it was like watching an old documentary from the '70s. Horrible narration. If you are looking for archive footage it is great, but if you want something more modern go with the Military Top Tens DVD w/ the Top Ten Helicopters feature on it."
4,Replacement FOB,We bought a 4 runner that was used and it did not come with a FOB. Was told that the Sequoia would work on a 4 runner. It did but unfortunately I did not get the correct instructions and had to go online to get the correct ones. Programming can be tricky but after a few tries you can get it to work. Overall happy with purchase.
3,Excessive Tangents Injure the Reader,"While I agree that the author has a way with description, the novel seemed to drag on in scenes that had really nothing to do with story. The novel is really a short story extended to 326 pages for the glory of showcasing the author's abilities with prose. Picture an independent movie. This is an independent book. You can appreciate the beauty of the art, but don't expect to be entertained. This book is best read a little at a time, perhaps over coffee during a quiet hour. I read it too fast I think. There is one reason I would recommend this book, however. The author truly has a grasp for how people feel. She addresses things you always think to yourself, but have never quite seen in print, or heard of from your peers. In fact, to me, the book was written entirely as though in Claire's head, as opposed to an external world, even though it's not in first person."
2,"An entaining narrative, but confusing","Although John McPhee can turn an interesting phrase, understanding the geology of California from this book would be difficult. From this test it would be very difficult to get a sense of the geological evolution of California. I had a hard time following his chronology, and I'm a geologist, living in California, and with quite a bit of knowledge of the geology of this state!"
5,Subduction junction,"One of the best John McPhee books ever, it's a masterpiece of skillful exposition on a complex and evolving subject. Highly readable, sophisticated and laced with amusing off-hand comments, this book is a classic in science literature."
3,"Pedantic, repetitive",This is a geologist's book rather than a learning book. Does contain enjoyable portions regarding CA history.
2,DIFFICULT READ,"This is a very difficult read. Forget it unless you have had at least Geology 101. Or at the very least, read the Roadside Geology of Northerna and Central California first."
1,phantom of the opera karaoke...misrepresented,"When I ordered this CD as a gift for my father, the Amazon.com page advertised this CD as a CDG....a CD with GRAPHICS. Upon opening the gift, the outside cover indeed said CDG, however, the inner sleeve said that ""due to copyright laws, lyrics could not be printed"". We assumed that since this was a CDG, the lyrics would be on the screen while the music was playing, but it was not. I wish that either the producers of the CD or AMAZON.COM would show more discretion on the items they label as CDG."
1,Do Not Recommend,"Purchased this Swann product and it broke within a year, wouldn't start up and lights just kept blinking. RMA'ed product back the the manufacturer, which took about 4 weeks, received a new one and it had the exact same problem. Customer support said they packaged it with the wrong power supply. I do not recommend this company or equipment. Will not purchase this brand again."
5,Powerplant Technology,"I have found this book since 1993 and curently it serves like a reference book for the courses that i teach in the subject of ""Electrical Power Plants"" in the ""Facultad De Ingenieria Mecanica,Electrica,Electronica"" of the ""Universidad de Guanajuato"" i have found the book content very understandable and with the theoretical deepness enough to take the aknowledgement of the thermal proceses for the electrical generation power plants additionaly, it tooks lightly the nuclear power plants technology and the renewable energy sources and the technology necesary to aproach them.The book gives a general sight for the college students involved in the energy areas of mechanical and electrical engineering. I strongly recomend it."
4,Great Reference Book,i used this book in Grad school. It is a great reference book now. Pretty good diagrams and explainations. Author seems to know his stuff.
1,Worst engineering book ever to date,"I myself am from UW Madison where unfortunately the author of this book is a faculty of. This book is poor in content, lacks examples and is not much worth of a technical script. The english is poor and contains a lot of errors. Authors from this university have some great books but this one is really low quality."
4,A great toy,"We purchased this as a toy for our two year-old, who loves guitars. He absolutely loves it! It's the perfect size for him. I don't think the overall appearance is high quality (crooked frets, streaks and smudges in the finish), but it does well as a toy. I don't know how well it would do as an actual instrument; we've tried to tune it, but it doesn't stay very well."
3,It is a toy ukulele,"Length:: 2:13 MinsMy review of the Woodstock Music Collection's Sopranino Ukulele. I forgot to mention the smell. Yes, as many reviewers have noted, it does have a strong turpentine/gasoline odor. It dissipates over time, but takes a while!"
3,Worth the twenty bucks.,"I had to break out the toolbox to secure the tuning pegs enough to get the uke in tune. Other than that, it was a well-built instrument."
4,Great Beginner Ukulele,This is a great ukulele to have for a beginner. My son is learning to play and enjoying himself. Great purchase and a lot of fun.
1,A big letdown.,"I bought this for my 3 year old since she loves Taylor Swift so much. I knew before it arrived that it would be poorly made and about the size of a toy, yet somehow I was still displeased when this item arrived. Thankfully, I didn't receive the Pink one that others have, but I felt like one hard days play with this 'guitar' and it would be broken. The fact that the strings were nylon didn't help its cause.You know the saying 'a penny wise and a pound foolish'? That sums up this experience. I immediately returned this item (thanks Amazon) and went to Ebay and bought another that was only $5 more. I have since received that one and not only was it a few inches longer but had real strings, pick, bridge, the works. This one can be tuned and enjoyed for quite some time. (Best part? the new one looks exactly like Taylor's guitar, just mininature)"
1,Completely untunable and unplayable - not even suitable for young children.,"We bought this ukulele for a toddler, so we didn't begin with very high expectations for the quality (or tune-ability) of the instrument. We did, however, expect that at least we'd be able to TIGHTEN the strings. Unfortunately, they're so poorly made, and the knobs are so loose, that any long-lasting tightening of the strings is completely impossible - to the extent that the strings are so loose, the instrument is nearly unplayable. Any tightening that is possible is quickly lost a few seconds after the ukulele is played. We're so unhappy we're returning the product."
3,Okay for the Price,"Considering the price and remembering that the average buyer is using this as a toy as opposed to a teaching instrument, it's a decent product for the price. It doesn't stay in tune because the tuners are loose. Even after tightening them to the headstock, they loosen. The nut, frets, bridge,and saddle are crooked. Once again, though, it's a cheaply priced ukulele so this is to be expected.The fun factor for this toy is high but that is because a two year old is playing with it. My two year old enjoys strumming this, but I will probably replace this one within the next year with a better built model. I gave the toy two stars for educational value simply because it can't be teaching him much musically if it doesn't stay in tune. Durability of the toy is average. t's not exceptionally made, but it is sturdy."
1,not safe,When we received this ukulele we were deeply disappointed! First & foremost the paint fumes emanating from this toy were caustic! The so called instrument was not tuneable and the overall quality was just pitiful! We sent it back!
2,Breaks into 2 pieces instantly..otherwise great!,"I bought this ukelele for the third time.. every time I bought this, it broke into 2 pieces from the wooden joint between the handle area and the main area.. they really need to fix the problem. Other than that, the product is great.. very entertaining for little kids.. enjoyed it as long as it lasted."
2,Fell apart quickly,"When I first bought this for my son we were all thrilled with it, but it wouldn't stay in tune for very long and we were always trying to get the strings tighter. After about a month the strings started falling off. I actually just threw it out today and bought a better guitar for him. I would not recommend this."
2,I got a bad one!,"I don't want to think that all the woodstock ukes are made this way, but I ended up with one that was unfixable, I guess you get what you pay for. :("
1,Really junky product,"This is barely even toy-quality, let alone musical instrument quality. It can't be tuned and one of the strings broke immediately. Spend a little more for something your kids will actually play and enjoy."
3,Hit or miss,"I've purchased two of these for my young kids to play with. The first one came with a crack where the neck meets the body, and I exchanged it for another. It lasted two years with typical toddler abuse, which I thought was great. I bought the second one a little over three months ago, and its neck snapped off while my son was playing it. They weren't any harder on the second than the first. I think it just depends on how lucky you get with the particular one you order. All in all, it's a really fun instrument."
1,Loved it until it broke after 2 days,We loved this guitar for our child until it broke at the joint between the base and the neck. Can't return since we threw out the packaging already.
1,"For playing, spend a bit more for a better instrument","We got two of these for gifts. I had the task of tuning them and thought the tuning machines in particular are absolute junk. I'm a guitarist and have a tuner but twist just a little too much and you're up WAY too sharp. Going back down the other way you have the same problem. I was able to get it reasonably close to in tune but as others mentioned, it wouldn't stay there.It's possible that you just can't get a decent ukulele for this price and in that case I'd spend a few more bucks for something decent. This is really sufficient for pretend or display. Nothing more. Best I can tell, you can get one for around $40 or better yet, get one used. Make sure it has at least satisfactory tuners if you care at all about playing it."
2,"Mostly junky, not as advertised","They advertise this as a starter instrument. It really is a toy and not any type of playable instrument for your kids. So, if you are looking for an actual playable ukelele on which you kids can learn, this is mostly useless. We have had it for a few months now and the strings still do not stay in tune at all."
4,Good Ukulele to start out with,"At first I was worried because it was so out of tune, but then I read the instructions about tightening the screws, and now it is just fine. My 5 year old and 3 year old really love playing with it."
1,A Good Performance Ruined,"I Imagine this was an excellent performance of Ashton's ""The Dream"". I say ""imagine"" because this DVD is an object lesson in how not to film a ballet. The camera work is frenetic, zooming in and out every few seconds, cutting from one part of the stage to the other without rhyme or reason, destroying all sense of flow and denying the viewer any possibility of appreciating the dancing or the choreography. Half of the shots are only of the dancers' upper bodies. Doesn't the director know that dance involves the feet and the body's line? By the end of the disc I felt dizzied by the cutting and peeved at having wasted my money. Save yours!"
2,Millions of better books out there,"This is not a good book. As the first review here states, an infant child is found in a barn and the *entire rest of the book centers on the woman who found the child and her desire to adopt him is repeated over and over, ad nauseum. A pseudo romance is sort of written, but only as a reason for the woman to make her quest for adoption more palatable to authorities. The very unlikely conclusion was forced and not believable. There are better books out there. I listened to the audio version of this book. While the narriator did a fair job, she could not improve the poor quality of the material she read."
3,conservative? liberal? who knows?,"This wasn't a bad read. The art and the scripting are pretty solid. However, this book demonstrates the dangers of attempting to say something politically relevant in a mainstream super-hero comic, because *everybody* seems to have decided they're going to be offended by it. The conservatives are whining about how ""anti-American"" the book is, while the liberals are grousing because the book is filled with pro-Bush ""propoganda.""If you can take a healthy dose of realism, even when it's uncomfortable, without getting your panties in a wad because your favorite political position may be shown as (GASP!) flawed, then you might enjoy this book. If, on the other hand, you're too thin-skinned to think about unpleasant realities like an adult, then 1) avoid this book, and 2) get over yourself. Please."
2,Fantastic art... horrible read,"John Cassady is one of the most talented superhero artists outside of Alex Ross. It is VERY unfortunate that the story that accompanies his art is so bad.This book is a shining example of: ""Great art does not a comic book make"". The story revolves around Captain Americas activities after 9-11 of 2001. It shifts, with little explanation, from one series of events to another. There is WAY too much exposition between scenes which makes for a very boring read."
3,seller sucks,The slippers are cool but shoemall which was the seller I ordered from took forever to ship it has been 3 weeks and I still don't have my item I already ordered them somewhere else and received them!
4,Silly but engaging,"The title of this episode is a bit obscure but the casting is absolutely brilliant! Having Warren Stevens playing a man without emotion and Robert Webber a being awkwardly learning about emotions, makes use of both actors limitations as performers. I love this series so I'm willing to overlook it's faults (the velour jumpsuits and rubber facemasks) and simply enjoy the tale. Of special note is Get Smart's Chief Edward Platt then billed as Edward C Platt."
2,Borderland?,"Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.Maybe the next book could be an new history based on archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book."
4,Borderland Assumptions,"First off, Ukraine means ""Borderland"" in Russian but not in Ukrainian. Uk-Ra-ii-Na goes back to pre-Akkadian Sumerian meaning ""Gift of Sun and Moon"" and further Ukraina was used before there was a Russia to be a ""borderland"" with. The Tsarist and Soviet regimes rewrote everyone's history to obliterate national and cultural identities. From writings of English composer Arnold Bax to Ukrainian writer Mykola Hohol' - Ukraina is truly ""Gift of Sun and Moon"" especially in May when the Nightingales return. And how about Kyiv (key-eve) and not Kiev?"
5,"Borderland, a look at family history","I bought this book for my husband who's family came from the Ukraine. He started reading it and did not want to put it down. He loves it. It is thourough, interesting, and human. An excelent read and an excelent purchase."
3,russian mindset - refuses to see lush ukrainian culture,"There are certainly connections between russian and ukrainian culture. But those of us who have gone to ukrainian schools know well how authorites can suppress the total picture of a culture. Get a taste of the beauty of Ukraine from this book, but be open to more and accurate info as well. Buy more books on Ukraine!"
1,Psuedo-science application in history,There is no point rehearsing all the negatives of this book already described by other reviewers. It's unfortunate consequence of our reality that to get credibility people need to publish. OFten they do unfortunately materials of less than acceptable quality ... and get established ... and then promoted ... Sad.
4,Great item & great little keeper for the small stuff,This is such a wonderful thing to have with your Pack n Play. It is a very handy little helper & keeps everything nice & neat. It matches my Graco Saratoga Pack n Play perfectly too. The only thing that I would change about it is that the wipes container should be alot bigger than it is. I found this just before my 2nd baby was born in July 2005 & I wish had found it sooner !
4,Nice-to-Have but not essential,"We used the P-n-P as a bassinet for our son until he was about two weeks when he moved to his crib in his own room. Until that time I was getting a lot of use out of the Organizer. Now we use the P-n-P occasionally in the living room and the Organizer is used for diaper storage. I could have stored the diapers anywhere else so I don't feel that this was worth the money. Also, the wipes storage is very shallow and therefore not very useful. The attachment makes the P-n-P wider that it as already which would cause a problem for those with limited room.I gave it 4 stars because I would have used it more if the P-n-P was used more often and because my cat LOVES hanging out on it so it's worth something :o)."
1,It falls apart if you put the diapers in it!,"I am so disappointed in this product. It is held together with sticky-back Velcro. There's no need for the Velcro, either, so it must be some cost or time saving thing for Graco. I put the diapers in it, and a few days later, it fell down (the diaper part detached.) My husband fixed it, but the next day it fell down again. I would definitely NOT recommend this part of the Pack n Play!"
5,Love! LOve! LOVe! LOVE!,"A must have with the pack and play. Keeps everything there at your fingertips...diapers, wipes, diaper ointment, brush, lotion, powder. So easy to assemble and attach."
2,"The Organizer, good and bad","Unless you have these spare wipes, the wipes dry out fast, no room to put my own case of huggies wipes, and the diaper holder kept on falling off after a while, it did not stick. It was nice in the begining but the wipes holder really should not be like that."
3,Lacking something,"The audio version of this book is a good adventure, admittedly, but the original book is a wonderful picture book. It took 39 artists (IIRC) to make all the art in the book, and by consigning it to cassette tape it just loses half the point. While I would still recommend it based on plot, I was disappointed by it."
1,"Atrocious. Bad art, awful story, tortured writing","I've read a lot of children's books lately, and this is one of the worst. My 6 year old and I were excited to read this book after reading _Dinotopia_. The same production team apparently helped on this book, and the book is clearly patterned on that bestseller. Sadly, this book in no way approaches the quality of Dinotopia. The vocabulary is at the college level, the story is awkward and forced, the dialogue is wholly unnatural, and most of the art is amateurish. I applaud the book's theme of conservation, and its respect for non-human life and intelligence. But beyond that, this book has very little to offer."
4,Splendid performance!,"Truly a magnificent performance by the Athena Ensemble. Charming, playful and masterfully maintaining the character of the opera! So very glad to have found this very enjoyable recording."
5,Absolutely amazing knves!,"These knives are incredible! My husband and I decided it was worth it to shell out the money for some good knives because it truly is a lifetime investment. They feel incredibly well made and are dangerously sharp - which we unfortunately found out from washing them on the first day! I've tried basic Cuisinart knives, and a fancy Japanese-made set but I'll never buy any other brand of knives again. These knives truly make it a joy to cook. I highly recommend them. They're still brand new and we haven't had any problems so far but it's worth noting that the warranty only covers defects in workmanship, not normal wear. Also, I don't know why everyone was complaining so much about the knife block. It looks attractive on the countertop and works fine. I guess one of the smaller knives ended up in a long slot but the rest are perfectly fine. Anyway, I care a lot more about the knives than the block, and these are a must have!"
5,Great Knifes Great Price,"I have been working in the food industry for more years than I care to admit, finally I decided to up grade my home equipment to the same high quality professional products I work with every day. This is a great set so knifes with enough variety to tackle all the home cooking needs. Henckels will always be the standard to look up to."
2,not a good match knives to block,"I was expecting far better quality fit between the knives and the block considering the money spent.The knives are of high quality as is the block but unfortunately the block is generic and once you actually put the knives in the set into the block it looks plain silly, as the handles point in all directions. For this type of money that is simply plain wrong and shows a totally unprofessional approach to their product.In fairness the knives seem to be as advertized and do look like they will have a good life. But as stated, this is sold as a set, an expensive set at that.Your far better off buying just the knife set and finding a wooden block locally that will accommodate the knives in a better fashion."
2,Recording quality an issue,"This recording is a disappointment because it skips at least a half-dozen times during one of the pieces (Dona Nobis Pacem). It is apparently a re-mastered recording but the skips are very distracting to say the least! Also, the audio portion consists only of stills of old photographs."
5,Coming Home to Fiesta,"Hope this is the start of a great tradition and collection of Fiesta dinnerware in my home. First pieces of Fiesta for me, but I grew up with these dishes. My mother has sets of different colors; my color of choice was always pink."
2,Don't Bother,"Looked like a nice ball to use with the Skilz Mini Hoop as it is 5 inches diameter ( same as Skilz ball).Pros:This is a nice looking ball, even appears well made.Great for displaying an autograph.Cons:-This ball is a brick. The original Skilz ball bounces about 30% higher.-Poor quality. After only a couple of weeks of next to no use, theindividual panels of grip have started to peel off the ball.I would expect a lot more from Baden and for this price it is unacceptable."
3,Helpful Introduction to the Civil War in Renaissance England,"The War of the Roses is the name given the the struggles in the late 1400s between British nobles from the competing houses of York and Lancaster for control of the English throne. The figures involved in these struggles (Richard the Third, Henry the Fifth, etc.) are the subjects of some of Shakespeare's most famous plays and, indeed, their political affairs are dramatic and colourful. The events of this civil war are parallel in style to the struggles in Renaissance Italy that set the context for Machiavelli's ""The Prince."" Charles Ross's book is a helpful introduction--about 140 pages of reading--to the main developments in these struggles that led shortly thereafter to the rule of Henry VIII, and then Elizabeth I. Ross's interpretation is a bit conservative, but overall he gives a fair sense of what was happening and why. This would be a good first book to read to get a handle on what the ""War of the Roses"" was about."
4,High quality and heavy duty,Seems very well made and functions flawlessly. The only slight problem I had was getting the male plug to seat properly - very tight fit.
5,Unlikely Mormon Glenn Beck,"This is truly an inspiring book/DVD I was truly touched by his change in wanting to quit drinking and his love for our Lord Jesus Christ... What a great conversion story. This can help many that struggle with alcoholism the importance of having Christ in your life to help you. You cannot doing it alone,"
2,I Don't Know,This movie leads people down the wrong path when they talk about God. Which God is he really following. I believe this movie leads people to the gates of Hell. It contradicts the Holy Bible in many ways. If You are a follower of Jesus Christ This isn't the movie for you. This doesn't show the love of the one and only true God. If You Don't believe then check the word of God when you really want to see how things stack up. Also look in Revelation 22:19-22
1,Cocaine and whiskey...,"The Beck story is very similar to others told by Americans. Drug and Alcohol addiction exchanged for an addiction to a ""higher"" power. Unfortunately for the rest of society, they can't hide the cocaine and express admiration for free markets instead of freebasing. He still has the look and act of an addict, which will lead many readers and viewers to wonder what he is really about. Depressing for those who suffer to overcome these problems without the economic means to cover them up to encounter gainful employment. Beck can truly be believed as a libertarian in favor of the legalization of narcotics."
5,A touching video...,"My respect for Glenn Beck skyrocketed after watching this video.A touching tribute to the spirit of man, everyone can come away from watching this with a feeling that no one is beyond redemption."
5,Great Christmas gift,"Enjoyed the book so much that I bought two extracopies and donated them to my neigbhorhood publiclibrary and elementary school....two places thatalways have tight budgets. Buy one for Christmas,your kids will love you."
1,Sorry folks....,"...but i don't like this episode one bit. The idea of changing your face completely with a frying pan-like object is quite silly, but that's not the problem.You see, most original Outer Limits episodes have a strong moral backbone, speaking for tolerance, humanity and peaceful solutions. I dig that. One Hundred Days of the Dragon, however, seems like it was made by completely different people. It scares us with the Yellow Communist Threat, few space aliens were ever portrayed as purely evil in OL as the Chinese in this one. Their plan: to fool the US army to retreat!No punishment is hard enough for the commie desacrating the throne of The President of the United States of America. In the end climax he is, for no apparent reason except revenge, disfigured by the hero. That's more Mickey Spillane than Joseph Stefano.Besides, i don't find the story or the acting that good."
3,Invation To Hell,"This is an eerie tale from the 1980s. It does not quite make it as a horror. More like a eerie drama. It is pretty entertaining, especially with the soap opers star, Susan Lucci. Shey played the female, succubus, demon in the movie very well. With a little more action and violence, this could have been a much better movie, still it is good for those who like a soft chill. I Did Like it though."
3,Decent and Different,"This was not a typical slasher, or supernatural movie of the 80's. Wes Craven does a nice job with the creativity on this one. The story revoloves around a country club in california. The new family joining the club, is eluded into thinking that the ""secret"" part of the club is only for a select few, who are admired most amoung all the other club members. Susan Lucchi from the ""All my children"" is in this one, as the evil main characters, who may just be satan him/herself..."
1,not worth it,This product quick working properly after 1 use- card slot wouldn't recognize card inserted- not worth time & trouble to return this cheaply made product- would NOT buy another or replace w/ same- a DON'T buy
4,"Not Bad, Great Price","I would have thought that finding a multi-port USB hub with media card slots would be easy, but apparently not.I was really happy to find this little product and for a great price.My only complaint about the product is that the power cord was not very long... maybe 3'. Other than that, it works as advertised, feels solid, transfers data quickly, and works as a hub.It even has little lights on it to tell you when various USB ports are in use.And it works just great with my 4 GB SD card."
3,Won't work compact flash,The USB hub works fine but the card reader won't work with compact flash. In fact I broke a compact flash card trying to make it work. Have not tried other types of cards.
4,Good for the money,"Speeds are decent, the USB ports definately come in handy.The build feels cheap however, but it is expected at this price point.Overall nice package, even includes a/c adapter for extra power if needed."
3,Angle Guide is Flimsy,The angle guide is fitted to the clamp with a smidge of glue. Quite a bit of torque is exerted on the glued pieces while sharpening and will break sooner than later if you sharpen a lot of knives. I use it to sharpen the wife's knives once or twice a year and this is not a sturdy item. Look for a clamp that's made of metal rather than plastic.
3,It's cheap and is expected of price range.,You get what you pay for. It breaks easily and the BB's received with it don't function properly so if you are going to use this for day to day use you should probably get more ammo. Although mine is broken it still functions for good uses such as a prop gun. I would recommend it to armature airsoft people and those looking for a prop gun.
4,Pretty good gun,"I just got this as my first air soft gun, and I'm highly impressed. The only thing I had a problem with is that it takes several attempts to get the spring truly working. Great first air soft gun."
2,fun for awhile,i had this gun for about a week until the spring and barrel dislokated.IDK what happened i was really careful with it.but it just brokeONLY BUY IF U KNOW HOW TO REPAIR OR IF U BUY A BUNCH 2 LAST U AWHILE
5,My son bought this with his own money and loves it. Although he is only 5 and a little too young to do it on his own.,"Although he is only 5 and a little too young to do it on his own. But he thinks its pretty neat, be aware you will have to get more bb's as it only comes with about 20."
4,first gun best gun,This was my very first bb gun it was very good gun shoots pretty far about 7 feet away and it hurts alot if tested on skin awsome gun if this is your first bb gun i loved it.
1,no,this is a very bad pistol very very bad pistol it gets jammed easily and bad accuracy mi advice spend an extra 10 dollars for a good one this is too over priced.
2,A Kids Review,Great fun for back yard 10 feet target practice but sucks get a sniper and be happy :)
3,A quick glimpse into the life and times of a navy seal.,"An all to brief account of a ""lifer"" navy seal and special warfare operator. From Vietnam to Lebanon and from Panama to Central America, Walsh was there. Big gaps in the time line and only one ""war story"" per deployment. Very opionnated and not afraid to tell it lke it was. For all his time in the service of Uncle Sam, I'm sure the book could have been two or three times longer on the page count. Mr. Walsh, if you read this, please begin work on Vol. 2. A good companion book to D. Young's THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, Navy Seal's in Vietnam"
5,Makes a classic subject exciting and enticing,"I'm impressed with how modern and interesting this book makes number theory seem. I've always liked this subject, but I've found the other texts out either too old-fashioned, boring, or too sophisticated. This book hits the mark. Highly recommended for the number theory enthusiast like me!"
3,Too difficult for beginner to follow,"I'm a newcomer to Yoga. I've tried a few videos and thought I'd try this one, and was disappointed. It moves along too quickly for someone who doesn't know the poses, and is not for someone who is stil building strength and flexibiliy. I couldn't do most of the poses as she does, so I gave up.If you know the poses and are familiar with Yoga, you might enjoy this as I did work up a sweat in the 15 minutes I was trying to follow along. The scenery was nice and the background music was unobtrusive and pleasant. Maybe I'll try this one again after I'm more in shape and familiar with Yoga!"
4,Question,"What recording is this? It's not from the complete set because it has Norman Bailey, and it isn't the old Unicorn LP because Mackerras stepped in to replace an ailing Goodall on that one. Is this a totally different immolation done in the original run at Sadler's Wells or does Chandos have the conductor's credit wrong?"
4,LET'S BE GRATEFUL...!,"Let me add to this somewhat lukewarm review that we should be grateful to have something of the fabulous Gunther and Hagen of Norman Bailey and Clifford Grant preserved on disc! I saw them three times in the original run of Twilight at the London Coliseum, and their replacements at the later revival (preserved on the live, complete set) are not nearly as good."
3,Ok but not great,I like the instruction part of the DVD but the actual lesson moved way too fast for a beginner like myself. The price is expensive. If you have experience doing ashtanga then it shouldn't be a problem. During the lesson they have way too many people taking part in the dvd so it's hard to watch one person to get an idea of what to do next. I will give it another try after I get more experience doing yoga in general.
5,Ease into Ashtanga,"i love this video. it has to be one of the BEST ashtanga videos, next to david swenson -- this video is easy to follow and the voice is so soothing and relaxing. i totally highly recommend this to anyone looking for something different."
5,Great Option for Yoga at Home,"A must have for the at-home ashtanga practice. I've had this video for years, and keep returning to it when my home practice needs a bit of a tune-up. I have to admit that I've never switched the teacher's voice, nor used the tutorials, but I think the video itself is well worth the money. I like the option to have a shorter practice, too. It's the DVD I give to friends thinking about getting into the practice."
1,Disappointing,For the expense involved in buying this book I was expecting a lot more. At best the book is a concise summary of a limited subset of SLC and Controllogix instructions. It does very little to enhance the documentation provided by Rockwell.
2,It's a little better than AB documentation...,"but not much.At least it is all in one place. Other than that it's way over priced. It's like one of those SAMS ""unleashed"" books that are just a reprint of the mfg's documentation.I could recommend it it if it was $35 bit not $140."
5,Our Lady and the Church,Our beautiful Lady and our beautiful Church are constantly mirroring each other immaculately throughout the pages of this book. Her exalted role in the world is most needed for all of us to look up to as a light while we walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I had an even deeper appreciation for the Roman Catholic Church after reading this book.
4,"A heavy, heavy tool","DeWalt makes some great tools: I'm convinced that my future hand tools will be from this company. However, in hindsight, I would not have purchased the ""hammer"" part of this hammer drill. While it may be occasionally useful, it adds an unconscionable amount of weight to the tool (as compared to a friend's 14.4 v Dewalt drill without that feature. When it comes to using a power drill, that extra weight can be tiring. In addition, it's ""longer"" than the hammer-less drill, making it not only heavier, but more unwieldy. In fairness to DeWalt, I think every manufacturer's hammer drill is bigger and heavier than the non-hammer variety. I should have known this before ordering. Otherwise, it's a well made tool, and does what it should; plus, the XRP batteries do seem to have a very long run-time. The reconditioned tool and case all seem brand new and I've encountered no problems whatsoever."
1,Celtic Hand Stroke by Stroke: Irish Half-Uncial from the Book of Kells,I'd save my money on this one. There are other books with a lot better instruction.
5,These chips are Smokin!!,The smoke from these chips made my BBQ so delicious i want to eat these chips by themselves with milk for breakfast.
5,beef chips,"I gave these to my husband for Chistmas to use in his 24"" smoker. The first thing we noticed is that they are actual chips, and not saw-dust. I would recommend these for anyone who has an outdoor smoker."
5,Excellent for beef,"These are excellent for beef; far better than hickory, alder, mesquite, apple, or oak all by itself. Using these chips, I have had vegetarians ask for seconds."
3,Mikey gets another hit he never lost his touch.,"There were a lot of self love,hate and peace brougt out by this album.One is showing his true grace really put into making a musical poem genre. Although mr.magic has seen a very large amount of stress in his long career.Life has gave him a wonderful chance in sharing all of his insides on musical gifts.(MIKE$$$$$$!NO MORE LIES PEOPLE)"
5,Wish I was 20 years younger.,"I have this story on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it so I decided to buy the book. It closely mirrors the DVD's, and had lots of pictures. Needless to say, I would highly recommend both. I've just started reading, ""Long Way Down"", and within a few pages have become as captivated as before. These adventures are the type of thing I would have loved to do 20 years ago, I can kinda get a feeling of what it must be like through Ewan and Charlie's travels. Thanks, Guys, for a really good time!!"
2,TAKE TWO PILLS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING! DO NOT BUY THIS DVD VERSION!,"'The Vampire' is a strange little Sci-Fi film. It's low budget, but has a very good cast of actors that we would all come to know in other films and TV shows. The make-up is........well...standard for this sort of thing. The film is about a doctor who while experimenting with animals, produces a pill that will turn you into a vampire!.....well sort of. While the victims throats all have the customary fang marks on their necks, the doctor really isn't a vampire, but a man who regresses to a primal state of being when he takes these pills(which have an addictive side effect). It's unintentionally funny and worth seeing if you like this sort of thing. I do want to point out that this film is available on a double feature with 'The Return Of Dracula' and the print is far superior, plus you get a two for one price which is always nice. This disc version is a DVR. The double feature is an offical release."
2,the vamped,"or 2.5 stars or 2, cuz it could use more exciting imaginated monsta scenes. this dvd by cheezyflicks ent. had perfect video/audio quality vs what one 1st reviewer said; maybe he got a different co. make."
4,Relaxing,I bought this to play during massage sessions and really liked it until about 45 min into the music when there is some gentle chanting. It caught me by surprise and so I only play it for those who don't mind the vocal. It is very brief but some do not like that part.
1,Do not buy this amp,"I have owned this Amp for 2 and a half years. At first it was great, but last nite. It finally quit working and I took great pains to keep it charged. It makes me so sick, I do not want anyone else to go through losing this amount of money. It has a wonderful Pignose tone. But, the battery will eventually fail, the parts are over priced, and the customer service is one of the worst in the business. If you need a good practice amp do not get one like this. It's even written the back that if you do not keep it charged, (like a cell phone) IT WILL DIE YOUNG. So there you go."
2,"Nice lotion, but not much scent.","I wanted to layer this with Coty Wild Musk cologne, but the lotion just smelled like unscented lotion. I gave it to my husband who doesn't care for scented lotions."
5,best episode,This is my favorite episode of the original outer limits series. A story that is as fresh now as when it first aired yet conveys the wonderment of its time.
5,Bravo! Salvo,"This is your basic murder mystery series, but with twists and humor. There is beautiful scenery and offers a slice of Sicilian life."
1,Not Leather!,"I wonder who is trying to pass these off as leather. The manufacturer? Amazon? These cuffs contain NO leather at all! After two visits to the gym they cracked at the seams. This revealed that they are manufactured from a foam synthetic substance. What a disappointment. Thankfully, the people at Colonial Medical Assisted Devices (where they were shipped from) were very gracious, and helped me resolve this matter in short order."
1,This is not what you think it is,I am a 14 year old girl and I am auditioning for the Play Peter Pan. I was very excited about this and so I bought the CD of the sing along Sound of music. When I listened to the insturmental only of this song I thought maybe that I was on the wrong song. It sounded nothing like My Favorite Things. And all through out the song there would only be a few parts that were how they were suposta be. In the begging there is only a few notes played! I would not recomend this CD to anyone.
3,Backwards cover,"I don't know if I got a fluke book, but ours had the cover both upside down and backwards. Not a major deal but for a 6 year old who loves wolves it is disappointing due to confusion."
2,Just Not Enough,"Yes, it gives us an idea about what is happening to society, unfortunately it gives only a very brief section on how to overcome it. I read the book and then gave it to my husband to read. It's not well written, spends a lot of time ranking on society and very little time helping someone find their way out of it. It also suggests repeatedly that the majority of people have this syndrome. I believe the majority of people are affected by the stress society places on sexuality, but most people do not suffer the obsessive addiction my husband does. Unfortunately the book has made him believe that he is not out of the normal and hasn't given him what he needs to understand that he IS out of the norm and that it's ruining our lives."
3,"The facts about the ""killer"" pornography.","This book is from a secular perspective, and gives incredible insight to the truth, many of us already know intuitively, porn destroys. It is amazing to see, even from a non-Christian eyeglass the effects these people have personally suffered, impacting their very personalities, ability to love, and the deep loneliness that is the end result of the users of porn. The ramifications on our society, are of catastrophic proportions, affecting every last one of us. I am a Christian, and know from God's word these things actually war against one's very soul, perhaps this could be the glimmer of hope to open the eyes to the facts that are starring us in the face.....Ted Bundy, the serial killer was quoted as saying.....""every violent offender he was in prison with had one thing in common, they were all addicted to porn, without exception...which makes sense after so many years of viewing people, with souls...as objects."
3,SO TINY.,"It is probably my fault for not looking at the measurement,but wow, I looked at the picture and it looked decent size,when it arrived I saw how tiny it was, and it is SO small."
1,Teeny Tiny,"Not knowing much about magnets I ordered this for my daughter to play with since she loves all things science. The price of the magnet led me to believe it would be a decent size. The magnet is an inch and a half tall. It's so small I could not believe it. I'm returning it. For me it was 1 star. If you need a tiny magnet, this is a 5 star for you as for me just a big hasssle. One I have to pay to return."
2,"lots of facts, but unorganized and poorly edited","The author has clearly done a good deal of research, and has stuffed all of his findings into his manuscript. Organization is not his strong point, which means that the reader is overloaded with information.What is worse, the quality of the writing itself is poor, and the editing atrocious. Much of the punctuation is just plain wrong, adjectives are overabundant, and some of the sentences are so badly constructed that one can barely comprehend what is being said.A good overhaul of grammar and style, plus a thorough streamlining of content, would improve this work tremendously."
2,"Seems like good scholarship, but not much fun","It is obvious that Richard Spence is a diligent researcher and he did a great deal of homework for this book. The result is an exhaustive (and exhausting) compilation of Sidney Reilly's activities and associations over the course of his career. Unfortunately this wealth of information is not really drawn into any themes or any kind of coherent narrative. Some of the ""Reilly myths"" are convincingly de-bunked, but there's not much on offer here to replace them. This might be a helpful work for the history scholar looking for names, dates, and places associated with Sidney Reilly but it isn't much fun for the armchair history buff."
4,"New to me, but good",This is the first Intel CPU I've had in a long time and the first Duo core chip. So far I'm enjoying it. I still have to figure out what I can and can't do with this chip. I don't regularly overclock but I might with this one as it seems easy to do from posts I've read on the internet.So far I'm pleased with my purchase.
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!,"The product arrived in a damaged box. I tried the processor in two computers and the same problem occurred in both. Wasted most of a week giving the seller the benefit of doubt, wrong decision. Apparently someone else returned the product and it was resold based on the looks of the packaging. Overall a bad decision to purchase from the seller and Amazon. Bought local at better price for a faster processor. Buying local in the future and not on line. In 20 years of PC experience this was one of the worst. Don't buy here."
5,Best Processor,"I`m using it and very pleased, very fast and no problems.I think this is the best buy for having a good computer.It is stable and has good performance."
4,"Great OC potential, if you have the right motherboard and revision of the CPU","The CPU comes in different revisions and depending on the revision and with which motherboard it is paired with, you can get a very nice Overclocking platform. However, you really need to do your homework before going with a OC platform. I personally like Thermaltake PSU, OCZ memory with Micron chips, and eVGA motherboards, though some (NOT Asus Striker Extreme) ASUS boards are good at OC too."
4,picture perfect,"got calender as a 35th anniversary gift. my friends loved it! one problem. package does not say ""do not bend"" my mail lady bent it and put it in mailbox! never got it totally unbent! gmk"
4,worth the money,"After reading the reviews on some of the other brands I decided on this one, although pricier, well worth it. The features of having the boat hang flat and even, the emergency stop on the ropes and the higher quality hardware and straps were what made me order this one. I cant say it was easy to install since I didnt install in myself. i had a friend help me who's super-handy (he already custom built one for his garage.) Heres what he commented on: The ""toughest"" part (not so bad) was the rigging of the ropes in the pulley. He said the direction were pretty clear but not as clear as they could have been. He put it up in about 2 hours max including tweaking a few things. After he finished he said that it was pretty SLICK and he really liked it. He said it had some great features that his homebuilt rigging lacked. Its working great for me and it was worth the price!"
2,A Disappointing Story With Disappointing Writing,"Let me first says that I am choosy. I am particular about what I read and what I read to my children.I expected that this would be a well done and exciting story coming from such an accomplished author as Jane Yolen. But sadly I was very disappointed.I thought the story was lacking, the characters were flat and the dialog stiff and unbelievable (and I'm not talking about the Scottish brogue).I love books in a series and with Scotland as a setting and I thought this would be a great series for my daughter and I to read to together but I will not be reading the next one and I won't be recommending it to anyone else either."
4,An excellent read for young and old alike,"As an older reader I was naturally hesitant to read a book aimed squarely at pre-teen readers. I wasn't sure whether it'd be a facile and tepid children's story or one with more complex overtones. Luckily, I got the second.Author Jane Yolen does an excellent job of not patronizing her younger readers. She tells a first-rate tale while keeping readers of all ages entertained throughout.This book reminded me of some of my favorite stories, like Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising series, Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles, and yes, even the Harry Potter books. This would be a great book to read to your younger children at bedtime. The chapters are brief with most of them ending with a suspenseful cliffhanger. I highly recommend this one."
3,Typos on kindle,"Story is good, but I am distracted by the typos. Some of them are so bad, I have no idea what word should have been there. I would rate it better if the typos were not so distracting!"
3,Too many holes in the story,"There were so many tidbits that never got explained. Information and events came and were presented with no depth. E.g.: Women & girls dressed as brides... Why? The bad wizard created an imp to help him. So why didn't he create 100 to help him? A card game might bring about events. But maybe not. Not even resolved at the end. I give this a 2 for 12-year-olds. A 3 for younger children, since it could be a nice intro to that good old Scottish folklore."
5,"What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.","This book is great. I own all of Lurlene's books, and this is one of my favorites. Once again Lurlene has written a poignant story about the medical struggles most of us never have to face. She describes the feelings and emotions of the characters so vividly, that you feel their pain and joy. You will laugh and cry along with the characters"
5,Gold Medal,"I love the way Ms. McDaniel brings to light the way the youth feel about death. Her books have made me more sensitive toward people who have cancer, and other disease. I have read all of her books and I am 23 years old. I recommend them to everyone who has had to deal with any of these diseases."
5,"My sister, Julianne's summary of this book","This is the best book ive ever read! Its very touching and moving which is why i like it. ive already read it more than three times, and its a good beginning for a series and i would welcome it. Leah is strong and very determined to live and thrive i admired her spirit. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read"
3,"Easy to read, entertaining, but childish & not realistic","I read this book in two hours because a hurricane had just hit and, having no cable or electricity, there really was nothing else to do. Since I indeed wanted to know what happened in the end, I have to admit it was entertaining, and with its easy words and lack of insight, it did not challenge my intellectual capacity, which is an advantage, in a way. But Gabriella's being an angel was so tacky and obvious! And Leah's character wasn't well developed at all. Overall, the story entertained me, but don't read it unless you're under nine, or have absolutely nothing else to do. I gave it three stars because I'm in the mood for more unchallenging reading and ordered the sequel."
5,This book is totally cool!,Lurlene McDaniel is a great author and I am now buying the sequel. Then I will probably buy the next sequal. She is really talented and this book informed me of how Amish people live and what it is like to be diagnosed with cancer. I recommend this book to everyone! It's great.
4,a good story,"BOOK ONE OF THE SERIES. FOCUSING ON A TEENAGER WITH CANCER. SHE CATCHES THE ACTUAL FEELING THAT WOULD BE FELT DURING A TIME LIKE THAT. THIS STORY WILL MAKE YOU SAD, HAPPY AND IT WILL KEEP YOU WONDERING WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. IF YOU DIG SPIRITUAL BOOKS WITH MANY SUPRISES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
4,First of the best,"Personally, I think this series is Lurlene's best. Though I read this book about a year ago, it took me a while to review it. This starts the story of Leah and Ethan. In this book, Leah is diagnosed with leukemia and meets Rebekah, Ethan's little sister who introduces her to their Amish family and a whole new world. After you read this book, you'll be sure to want to read the second and third books."
2,Not her best.,"I read Lurlene McDaniel's book, Angels Watching Over Me, but I didn't like it. This was definitely not her best work, as I've thoroughly enjoyed some of her other novels. What's the problem with this stor? Firstly, the plot is a little farfetched. Secondly, Leah is not a believable cahracter. Leah talks like a women from a few centuries back and doesn't act at all like a teenager. Thirdly, this just isn't well written well. It is written with too much biblical content. McDaniel needs to face reality. This isn't going to happen in real life. Her books are supposed to be about life. This contradicts her own statements. This book did have some strong points. The character of Molly was well developed and Leah's feelings about Ethan were well demonstrated. Overall, I would have to say, Come on McDaniel. This just isn't your best."
2,Not worth the Time and the Money,"I am a student who happens to have read both John Hull's 'Options, Futures and Other Derivatives' and his 'Fundamentals'. To say that 'Options, Futures and Other Derivatives' is a good book is a great understatement, and can even be considered an insult. Yet, this book, which is targeted at readers who are not as acquainted with derivatives fails to impress. Through out the book you can feel how John Hull struggles to explain things in a simple manner. Sadly, his efforts have failed, and this is most evident when my fellow classmates had a hard time understanding the materials starting from Swaps. When we reached the section on options pricing, the book lacks the rigorous math that is needed for students to fully appreciate the beauty of deriving things like Black-Scholes. Overall, if you are a beginner, go straight to 'Options, Futures, and Derivatives'. This book is not worth wasting time over."
3,not worth the money,As promised this book contains no calculus.However it looks more like a formula sheet.There are some typos in some important parts.The intuitive explanations for some important topics are omitted or not well explained.Solutions manual is just a waste of time.Actually the book doesn't contain good questions at all.Despite the fact that it's one of the most used textbooks for the entry level in options and futures it's really not worth the money.One can find online lecture notes and do with them without having to pay that much money.
2,Used for FIN 4763,"Even though my professor didn't use the book as much as I expected, the content of this one were merely boring lectures explained the reason why my school changed the book after this semester."
2,Female action scene was less than I had expected,"I like the female fight action movies (woman or women defeat man or men). But in this movie, female action scene was less than I had expected. PRODUCER AND SUPERVISOR MUST WATCH THE FOLLOWING MOVIES if they produce the female action movies.(1)Xena Warrior Princess series(2)Tomb Raider(3)Ultraviolet(4)Sister Dragon (Japanese title: Onna Hissatsu Ken)"
4,Brilliant tool,"I really thought I was just going to pick up another book to be a tool in my 'writers' tool box. I had no idea that I would definably pick up the sharpest tool in the tool belt, and begin a journey of self discovery and encouragement.To be told is an invitation to seeing that your life has a purpose and bringing hope to your future, all at the end of your own pen."
3,Story...,"This book was assigned reading for me. I had to use the word Life in place of Story. Story felt too fictional to me, the book discusses how we share our story(life) with others and that is real and true. The use of the word story put me in the mind of fairy tales. It was hard to get past this use of the word Story when I knew he meant Life. I will chalk the word usage up to Mr. Allenders touchy-freely side and move on."
4,Why Can't U Free Some Time - Armand Van Helden,"UK CD Single Track Listing for -""WHY CAN'T U FREE SOME TIME"" - ARMAND VAN HELDEN1) Why Can't U Free Some Time (Radio Edit)2) I Can Smell U3) Why Can't U Free Some Time (Superchumbo Vocoder Mix Edit)2001"
2,Mediocre book spreading one good idea too thinly,"Although the concept of competence-based resumes is very useful in the current job search environment, this book is infuriatingly written. It is reminescent of those ""how to draw a face"" tutorials of my childhood: Step 1 - a circle; Step 2 - add two lines for the nose and mouth; Step 3 - Mona Lisa. The example resumes provided were useful, but the text descriptions of how to get there were inane. Moreover, this is useful but not at all the revolutionary concept the authors describe. Recommended only if you pick it up at a used book store."
3,Does the job,"I purchased this kit to install a Pioneer head unit in my Grand Cherokee. I prefer the pocket style because I hate wasted space. Overall it works well and is pretty solid. My only gripe is that after being installed for a year now, the center is sagging just a tiny bit into the pocket. The weight of the head unit seems to be pushing it down. I use to keep my cell phone in the pocket but now it's a bit too small in the center. It really only makes a difference because the pocket is very small, they worked with what space they had though. Doesn't look like they could have made it any bigger. When I installed this kit, I drilled a hole in the back of the pocket for my AUX cable to run through. Worked out great! Now I use the pocket as storage for the cable when I'm not using it with my iPhone. Has a much cleaner look than having a cable hanging out. For the price, I certainly can't complain, you shouldn't either."
2,Does NOT fit a 96 Jeep Cherokee,"I bought this for my 96 Jeep Cherokee so I could install a aftermarket radio, but it does not fit.Not even close.Never mind the CD pocket, the plastic ""frame"" itself is way too big to fit inside the opening where my stock radio was. A round of applause to Amazon for a easy refund after I brought this to their attention.I gave it 2 stars because it is very sturdy, it just doesn't fit my Jeep."
2,Damaged on arrival,"Nice design and would have worked perfectly, except that one tab was broken on arrival.The device is somewhat generic and the instructions clearly show various tabs to cut off and which to keep for your car model. I had about 8 to cut off, but of the two that I needed to remain, one was already broken off during shipment.I didn't want to go through the exchange process (since the car was all apart at this point), so I fashioned a bracket to replace the broken tab. It now looks great and works fine, but was a pain to do."
2,Did not fit,"Indicated it would work for my Jeep, but it did not. Had to return. Thanks amazon! Usually very happy with purchas4es but this one was a dud."
5,Perfect for my 1993 dodge 250,This fit perfect in my 1993 dodge ram 250. I was kind of nervous at first but I now have it installed in my truck. It fits my new kenwood radio perfect.
5,Nice alternative.,"Fits in a 1999 Jeep Cherokee perfectly with no modification. Sturdier than I expected, overall pretty nice and preferable to the alternative wide black bar. The slot is small but just right for my remote (I put a piece of foam in the back of the slot to make it a little more shallow)."
5,30 minute install!,"I purchased this to fit a new radio unit in my 2001 Jeep Cherokee and it fit without any modifications and I had the unit in and working inside of 30 minutes,"
5,Works fine w/ Jeep Gr Cherokee,I bought this to replace the stereo in my 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Fits fine after you cut off a few tabs as noted. The CD tray is better than losing the space.
1,Jeep buyer beware,"This product is ONLY for a Jeep Cherokee and WILL NOT FIT 2002 Jeep Liberty, and possibly others. The installation guide clearly states that it fits the 1974-2004 JEEP CHEROKEE only..."
4,Awesome!,The book was really nice. The bag it came in was a not really protective but it did the job. Thanks.
5,excellent condition,"I like purchasing through Amazon in case there is ever an issue with product quality. This company did a great job with shipping on time. The book was listed as in ""very good"" condition, but I would say that it arrived in pristine condition. Also, the price of the book had dropped since I had put it in my cart to save, and Amazon did give me the lower price without my even having to ask for it."
2,An overall Disappointment,"This book was largely a disappointment. I had heard previously that this was the leading high school text that is used and had high expectations. I was disappointed to find a plethora of type errors (including math mistakes!) and also very poor descriptions of things like bonding theory, equilibrium constants, reaction rates etc. The book covers a lot but fails to get real advanced in much of anything. I would reccomend for the advanced high school student a college level text with a good teacher instead of wasting your time on this."
1,"Fluffy, disorganized, not good at teaching or guiding","The authors do not know how to make chemistry concepts clear and simple. They make simple concepts complex. The book is full of fluffy materials and long paragraphs of commentaries.I agree with many reviews on this board. This is not a good book for high school students. The only good reviews about the book are for the condition of the books, praising Amazon services. Contents are the king! I can live with an old book with good contents. I am very disappointed that our schools choose this book as textbook."
2,"detailed, but not reader friendly","this book contains all the necessary information, but the way its written leaves much to be desired. if you're trying to learn for yourself expect to read each paragraph at least twice before grasping the idea. also it fails to simply walk the reader through chemistry equations (molarity, molality, ect.)"
1,Terrible introductory text,"Good thing my teacher was so good because this book is terrible.The explanations are lacking in important areas and overdone in others. It spends like 2 pages on VSEPR theory, incomplete activity series and solubility rules, and terrible intro in stoichiometry. We only did 15 chapters, but this book didn't help at all. I didn't even read half of it because the problems offer no challenge whatsoever. Not enough application problems. The end of section review Qs only ask for definitions and explanations, no real chemistry. No difficult and tricky questions whatsoever.Honestly, no clue why high schools use this text so much. Pretty sad if this is the best there is."
3,Prentice Hall Chemistry,"The book seems fairly good, a bit too much information for middle-school kids, probably more than they need. It seems very comprehensive to me, I hope the students make good use of it."
5,PRENTICE HALL CHEMISTRY STUDENT EDITION 2008C,This is a good introductory book on Chemistry for either High School or college students. I'm currently using it for tutoring purposes and it is working out very well.
5,Stedman is a true thought leader,"Stedman Graham is a master of leadership. His work on diversity is rich with insight. His concept of leaders not labels is brilliantly relevant to not only the US culture but eqally critical to optimize the benefits of this new ""flat world"" global economy. The richness of our differences is one of the keys to our competiveness and innovation both as organizations and individuals. This is a book every one should read if they want to improve thier quality of life and influence. Buy it, read it and live it."
4,interesting read...,"This book was a required text for a class of mine in the library/information science profession. It reads sort of like a motivational piece that highlights the importance of skills talent over ""labels"" in the 21st century. It's written by Stedman Graham, a close associate of Oprah Winfrey. For those interested in such topics, this a decent find. It could be used as a supplement to other works available."
3,Poor tripod attachment,"It fits Apple 15"" Pwrbook comfortably, the camera compartment and the accessory compartments are all excellent. The bag is, as with all Lowepro products are, very well constructed. However, there is one HUGE flaw with this bag: the tripod carrying attachment is very impractical. I bought this unit online so I didn't have a chance to test it out. If you plan on using this bag to carry a tripod, look elsewhere."
4,Lowepro Computrekker AW backpack,"I am quite satisfied with the CompuTrekker. I purchased it because I wanted a more compact and rugged carry-on for both my laptop and my SLR with extra lenses, and the product does this very well. I packed my camera, two extra lenses, a small camcorder, charging units for both plus a few small accessories. My laptop also fit, but I was a bit concerned that it was a bit tight. However it worked well.My only complaint is that strapping on a small, compact tripod onto the outside seemed cumbersome, and in the end I left the tripod at home. I will experiment some more with ways to secure it with the somewhat confusing elastic cords, and if I can do that, I will revise my rating.Bottom line is that I am quite satisfied that the pack does what it is supposed to do, even if adding the tripod is a bit problematic."
5,"Magnifecent backpack for combi photo/laptop, l Iove it","I was looking for a backpack that could hold my camera gear and a laptop.I had minitrekker before which was for me the perfect backpack.This now is the best mix, same backpack now with a laptop compartment.Slightly thicker (4cm).So, yes this is a good product.Peter"
3,Returned it for a Kata Bag,"I ordered this bag and a Kata R103 at the same time because I just couldn't decide based on the item descriptions and reviews. After trying them both I think the Kata bag is much better. First the camera compartment is much more convenient to access since it has a seperate opening on the front of bag, with Lowepro you have to be careful not to spill other contents out when getting the camera out of the main compartment. The Kata bag on me feels much more comfortable and ergonomic, since these are big backpacks, comfort is very important. Since they are of similar price, I kept the Kata bag."
3,"Not a good backpack, holds a ton of gear","I think it is a little thick backpack. The laptop compartment did not fit in my 15.4"" acer laptop. The backpack is well padded but somehow it does not feel comfortable on theb back. It always give a pain in my shoulder when I put it on, but it is a good bag to transport lot of gear.Personally I wish I had purchased a bag which is comfortable to carry & not so thick."
4,Not for everyday use,"This is an extremely well-made bag with exceptional padding. There are almost infinite ways to configure the removable, padded inserts in the main camera compartment. The laptop section is extremely well-padded, but is not practical for my laptop, as I have to push and pull to get it in and out. I occasionally use that pocket for carrying my Manfrotto monopod.The bag is large and very heavy when fully loaded, so I do not use it for everyday shoots. It does provide the additional shock protection and security I need when travelling.I currently have it configured to hold a Nikon D40 with 18-55mm lens attached, a Nikkor 55-200mm lens, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28, chargers and cables for each camera, and an IOMEGA portable hard drive. I store the camera manuals and spare memory cards in the interior zippered pockets."
5,Great!,"I use this twice a week and it seems to really make my skin glow and look more radiant. I have sensitive skin so it does tingle a bit after I apply it, but its temporary and doesn't irritate my skin, at all. Along with the skin lightning cream it really does help to lighten brown spots and even out skin tone."
2,derma E rehydrating Serum,"I purchased this serum due to the ingrediant hyaluronic acid, which helps with restore and maintain the skin's moisture barrier(i.e. dry patches, dry skin, and wrinkles). The product comes in a generous 2fl. oz. pump bottle which nicely controlls how much product is disspensed. Only a pin dot is needed to cover your face. PLEASE NOTE: if you're bothered by fragrance, do not purchase this product. I ended up trashing mine due to this. Also, the serum was a little to thick for me. This would be a fantastic product made in a fragrance free formula. I use Cerave moisturizing lotion as my serum with no problems.Due to the fragrance problem I only gave this product 2 stars. I would not recommend this product if sensetive to fragrance."
2,Too strong of scent,"I was surprised being all natural it would not be so strong of a scent. So strong hard to use. Also nothing goes over it well like a moisturizer just comes off when applying ,makeup . If I had not thrown away the boxes I would ship it back."
2,did not ship the correct item,I ordered the firming serum and was sent the hydrating serum and they advertised the wrong product.I called and they said they no longer carry the firming serum and could not offer the exchange. Not happy about this!
3,My Favorite Folksongs,"There are missing pages in this reprint - blank pages - I don't know if this is a mistake on the part of the mystery publisher who produced this reprint or the missing pages were missing in the original, but it would have been nice to have seen a notatation about the missing pages in the preface of the reprint if that was indeed the case -frustrating not knowing - I did though enjoy finding this publication of Sembrichs favorite songs -"
5,Fantastic product!,"This laundry detergent really gets clothes clean, yet doesn't cause irritation for those with allergies and sensitivities. Plus, it doesn't harm the environment. It's also a great value. I have a front-loader, and we use 2 tablespoons per full load!"
4,Buffy kicks bum,The game starts out with a traning bored thats not to bad the dilogue is good but gets a little repetitve the action is great the plot is preety good and the fighting arenas are awesome and you can have a friend fight you and olso once you enter a fighting arena your friend can become pepole in the game witch is not to good but still fun and the game is fun even if you already beat it the only real problom is that buffy says some lines over and over but over all it is a great buy and I highly recomand it
3,Not as good as it could be....,"Despite the many many happy reviews of this game (one of the main reasons I bought it) I have to admit to being pretty dissapointed. I'm not a hardcore gamer by any stretch of the imagination but even I found this pretty easy to play. A bit too easy, and too repetitive. Every level felt the same - kill vampires, kill spiders, kill strange lobster like monster thingys...but with no real feeling of challenge. The graphics and audio are excellent, as are the voice overs, but I almost felt as if I was playing by numbers here. Try Indiana Jones and the Emperors Tomb for a more heart pounding game."
4,A big surprise,"My Fiancee purchased this game for herself, and I wasn't interested in it. After watching her play for about 15 minutes I started wanting to play it myself. the graphics are pretty good. The game play is very fun minus the usual camera angle problems associated with all third person games. Wether you are a fan of the TV show or not going around and staking vampires on this game is alot of fun. I found that being able to use the crossbow in sniper mode was great shoot the vampire in the heart from long distance and you wont have to fight close."
1,Buffy the Fun Slayer,"Pound for pound, the most boring game I've ever played. More action in Atari's Space Invaders. Obvious continuation of Teen Beat Magazines to market untalented actor(s) in every entertainment media as possible. Suggest you save your money and sit alone in a dark closet for more fun."
2,Buffy disappointment,"There is a reason why the price has dropped on this game. It has nice graphics and sound, but moves from being extremely simple to ridiculously difficult. The voice-overs become annoyingly redundant and much of the action occurs in the dark (though reasonably this is where vampires live). The difficulty level increases only because there are no interim saves, and you are forced through mind-numbing repetition. Silly timing jumps negate what otherwise would be a cute juvenile adventure package, and seem much more likely for a Mario Brothers package.I would not recommend this game. You might want to consider Halo, Enclave, or even BloodRayne."
5,Buffy Rocks the Box,"Don't be fooled by the cover, and the title. Buffy Is one of the best games released on the Xbox. Great vampire action. Hours of gameplay. Great replay value. A must have for action fans."
5,Long Live The Slayer,"Step into the shoes of Buffy Summers. In this game you will have fight off the deamonic creatures of the night. You will recognize some of the other fellow ""scoobies"" as Xanderand Willow. This game is loaded with over 50 slayer moves. You'll get to use such things as shovels,mops,rakes,baseball bats,crossbows and ofcourse the stakes. When you first start the game, you face these really whimpy vamps then as you proceed, they start to get harder and harder. Almost every level has a secret hidden somewhere, so keep an eye out. There is only one word to describe this game... GREAT!! Roughly based on the shows third season, you'll see some friendly, and not so friendly faces. There is only one thing you need to remember ""a good slayer knows whats around her"" All in all I'll have to say that this game is offially 5 by 5!"
5,This Game Is Great!!!!,I purchased the video game for my son who is a Buffy Fan. He thinks that the game is a lot of fun. There's a lot of action and he can play it all day . Even his older sister (who thinks everything he does is not cool) is addicted to the game. That's the only time they can be in the same room without any complaints. (YEAH FOR THE GAME!!!!)
3,Good for Hardcore Fans Only,"This game isn't great honestly, compared to most video games it will leave a lot to be desired. It's your run-of-the-mill adaptation -- and like most it's pretty poorly done.However, if you're a major fan of the series like I am, you'll enjoy the game despite it's lack in quality.If you just want a fun game to play and you don't care much about the franchise, then don't bother, find another game."
5,Couldn't Be Happier,"I was thrilled that not only could I find this game in Amazon but when I ordered it it came very quickly and was in execellant condition. I could not be happier, I could not ask for more. I'm a member for life!!!"
5,Great Buffy game!,"I enjoyed the game a lot, although it isn't quite as good as the later Buffy game Chaos Bleeds. In that game, the fighting system is better; you can stake vampires dead after just tossing them to the ground. In this one, you can only stake them dead after you reduce their energy level to zero. It's a minor difference, but it makes the battles noticeably harder.Chaos Bleeds is also better because it allows you to play not only Buffy but also Willow, Xander, Spike and Faith. Still, I enjoyed the storyline which takes place during Season 3 involving the return of the Master. It was fun to explore locations such as the high school and Angel's mansion. It was also great fun to be able to battle Spike. I definitely recommend this game! (And it works on the Xbox 360!)"
4,Still good!!,"I first played this game on my friends xbox back when it had first came out. I was very young at the time and I was immediately hooked. Sadly I didn't have an xbox like he did so I only got to like the 5th level. After getting my 360 I knew I had to get this game. As a young adult I STILL love this game. It's so much fun and very well put together. Buffy has a full arsenal of great fighting moves at her disposal and it's fun to mix and match combos to see what you get. However, this game is nothing more than running around beating vampires to dust. This may not be your style but I recommend this to ALL Buffy fans. This game may be old but it's great!"
2,No instant save ruins this game!,"I'm not a fan of the show, but I found that the graphics and storyline were terrific and often funny. However, I absolutely hated the fact that I couldn't save during crucial parts of the game (such as after slaying one of the tougher creatures). Instead the annoying checkpoints are used at designated points (which are often VERY far apart). I became so frustrated having to go back and replay from a previous checkpoint 10 minutes of play back in the game that the game lost its fun and became a burden. I'm glad I rented this game because I will not buy it."
1,"What's with the reviews, Marty McFly?",How is it this game has all these reviews and high ratings when it won't be released for three more months?I guess Doc Brown must be renting out his DeLorean.
1,Do not listen to all the fools who already review,"It is important to wait until somebody who has played the game reviews it so that they can tell you about the important things such as gameplay, frame rate, and how many bugs the game contains. More importantly they can tell you if it is fun, rather than rambling on about screenshots and the premise of the game like most of the fools who have posted here do."
4,Nice,"This is an exact rip from a SNES game, just with updated rosters, to me. It was exactly the same in the style of the game, and the way it played. Like the SNES version, It's sound it horrible, the gameplay is nothing special, but they games are quick, fun, and sweet to a point. I would reccomend this game to hockey fans, definitely."
4,This game is enjoyable,"I found that the game takes a bit of getting used to. Once that is figured out, it is very enjoyable."
3,I could take these or leave them,"I used these with a smoking attachment for a Weber Genesis gas grill. I soaked these first, so they actually took *forever* to start smoking.... forever being about 30 minutes. I think if they were chipped in finer pieces, it would have been better.They definitely made the grill smell nice, but did I notice an effect on the veggies? Not really."
5,Great Idea,What a wonderful gift. This was such a pratical thing for my daughter to keep track of her friends. What a great idea!
1,Magical Boredom,"When I purchased Magical game cards I thought the set would be more highly priced. I looked at the box and I was right. It said it was a $...value for $... I reasearched why this was. This game appeared to be two years old and is not a fad anymore. My question was answered. So I purchased the game. The box came equipped with five booster packs, three of which were for other expansion packs of Harry Potter. One Starter set, and four seven packs of movie cards which cannot be played with. When I played it it was so boring. The object of the game is to make your opponent discard all of his or her cards. Other reviews you may read about this item say you can cast fun spells and summon creatures to duel in battle, but when you really start to get into playing you'll see its just a matter of discarding cards. One after another. I'd recommend this game for ages 6 to 9."
2,Mild Disappointment,"I got this stuff (from a different vendor) to flavor the morning pot o' joe I split with the female of the species, who likes hazelnut but is strictly a no-sweetener gal. Sniffing the open bottle, there is a definite aroma of hazelnut (the flavoring is artificial.) However it's too weak to even be detectable at solutions of less than 1 oz per cup or so, which means that you're really sweetening up your coffee considerably, as the syrup is SUGAR free, not SWEETENER free. Also, even at 25.4 oz per bottle, you're working your way through the bottle at a good clip every time you brew a pot.I haven't noticed any aftertaste, but it's hard to notice ANY taste at ALL! Next time, I'll just get flavored creamer."
2,Just O.K.,"While I ADORE Weleda's rose oil (used after the shower before I towel off), the soap is unremarkable to me. It is just soap that doesn't do anything special and is kind of expensive. It does not smell as lovely as the oil, and doesn't seem to have any kind of moisturizing effect. While it was nice to try, I will not be repurchasing."
2,It's fair at best,"This book could have been cut in a third. It is a little too much of a ""spiritual journey"" in one sense and then a review of anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and physics in another. Very little information about aquatic techniques and progressions. Does not really reflect the ""therapy"" aspect of aquatics."
5,It was great,"This CD single was not great because of ""Singing In My Sleep."" It was great because of the acoustic version of ""Closing Time"" recorded in John's basement. If you are a really big fan of Semisonic, buy this single. Even if you have ""Feeling Strangely Fine,"" buy this single. You will regret it if you don't!!!"
1,TOO FAST,"I've played this piece, and while it is not a death march, the tempo marking is only 72. This recording is played way too fast, I can hardly stand to listen to it."
5,Love It!,"Great soap! Love it! Very light, pure and sensitive. Leaves skin very moisturized! Natural and great light scent. Great for face."

3,"Some good songs, ultimately for shock value","From the get-go, ""Drunken Hangman"" announces this isn't your typical rock album. Ironlung's garbled vocals are usually about weird things like Wendigo, decapitations, Civil War guerrillas, whales, and monsters. Though creative, he makes the mistake of letting the distortion do the work for him -- he needs to shout into the mic instead of mumble into it. That's one of the weaknesses of the album. ""Gibbetted Captain Kidd"" is the strongest song, with ""Scream of the Wendigo"" being a guilty pleasure. Ultimately, the title track (Scissorfight's attempt at a love song) shows that this disc is fun, but isn't one you can keep in the CD for too long."
3,Dense reading,"I have to read this book to prepare for a summer research program; however unfortunately for a high school student, this text is unreasonably concise with the proofs and makes for very tough independent study."
4,So Close to Immortality,"This game is superior almost every category (gameplay, graphics, sound, fun, etc.) but falls short b/c of some silly decisions involving game play modes.You can't create a player and use him in Franchise Mode. If you play Franchise Mode, you must play an 82 game season every year (instead of shorter lengths available in single season mode). Those two things really made me think, ""I wish they didn't design the game like this.""But sure as sugar, I like playing and can't wait for them to get all the little things right next year."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is, by far, the worse basketball game ever developed.It would be an understatement to say that 50% of the time that you pass the ball, its stolen. When playing against a friend, all you have to do is hit the jump button when someone goes to pass and you will steal the ball away. On top of that, this game has absolutely no player ratings. There is no way to check what categories your players are good or bad in. I find that especially horrifying, considering that I was able to check player ratings on my 1992 NBA game (Bulls vs Blazers for Sega)."
3,above average,"Prelude to Rebellion was an ok graphic novel. The binding was very good (something I haven't said much lately) and the story and art was above average. There was only 1 problem, but it was major. It was the plot. The plot was extremely hard to follow at times, and at others it just didn't make sense. The art was worse than Outlander, but not bad either. Prelude to Rebellion is not worth the full cover price, so either buy it used, find it cheap, or just pass it by."
3,Interesting,"This was an extremly interesting story. A pleasure to read, this makes a delightful addition to an Star Wars collection. It works as an extension of Episode I, yet still makes for a good time on its own. My verdict: if you've got the money, buy it!"
4,Handy,"This item likely has more capabilities than my senior brain can ever learn to use, but it is very handy. Metric to inches (or feet), Neuton-meters to inch-lbs., fractional inches to mm., this thing can do probably more than I'll ever have a need for, but it's great for quick metric to US conversions, or vice-versa. Or you can use it as just a regular calculator. It's a keeper for me!"
2,Very dated material... may TOO outdated.,"While some of the instruction in this book is valuable, MOST of the material is terribly dated.Most of the equipment, computer, and software references are focused on the late 1990's. As a result, much of the instruction is focused on outdated limitations of old cams and NLE software, which have been vastly improved over the last few years.There are good technique chapters in the book, but since much of THAT material is available in current books, I cannot recommend this one at the price.This would be a GREAT book if the author were to do a complete rework and update; using material from current trends and equipment."
4,17 month old loves it!,"This toy is great. Yes the little magnetic shapes fall out very easily, but it's really not a big deal. My daughter loves this, she loves scribbling and erasing. Keeps her busy. She always returns to play with it after leaving it for a while, so definitely not a boring toy. She loves to just carry it around the house too. Good for teaching how to write her name, letters etc. without the mess of crayons (for her age). You won't regret buying this toy!! I would say the age limit is for 16 months - adult LOL, because everyone seems to play with it."
4,quiet toy that leaves no mess,"My 2yr. old son loves it. And I love it too because it makes no noise, requires no batteries, and won't leave marks on the wall like crayons. The little shape magnets that come with it are already lost. But other than that this is a timeless classic."
3,Falling Pieces,This is a fun toy and lots of fun for my 3 year old twins. My major complaint is that the the shape magnets fall out all of the time and we spend a lot of time trying to find all of the pieces. Why couldn't they make a storage compartment or made where the shapes are suppose to rest magnetic so they would stick on? I have made up an accessory to attach to the handle to hold their pieces while not in use.
1,Script Supervising - 50 years ago,"I have a lot of credit I have to give Pat Miller. For being the legend she is in film, for trail blazing for those of us that came after, for helping found a union that protects us even today. But, alas, writing this book is not one of the things I can praise her for.Having actually worked as a script supervisor on features and TV I can tell you that if you want to learn how the job was done 50 years ago, or how not to do the job of script supervising, read Pat Miller's book. Her techniques and methods are very out of date. Even with current revisions.Also Ms. Miller's book only scratch hes the surface of the job itself. It took me 120 hours of intensive class room work to learn all the facets of script supervision. I doubt you can gleen that from a book.If you want to learn the job I suggest you take a class from Jim Kelly Durgin."
5,Great for the newbies and those with experience,This book is a great tool for those with experience as well as those who are just thinking about getting into the business. I carry a copy with me on every set! :)
2,Fun Fades Fast,"Perhaps I should have heeded the warnings of those who played High Heat 2002 for the GBA. Then, maybe, I would have avoided this game entirely. I generally like sports games, but this one committed the cardinal sin of gaming: it just wasn't fun.The biggest reason for this is that the gameplay is not that great. As a batter you better swing at everything or else you'll go down looking. As a baserunner, you have the option of getting picked off...err...stealing a base. As a fielder there's next to nothing you can do to prevent stolen bases. And don't expect your pitchers to go a complete game. The sixth inning you'll be fine and in the seventh you'll be throwing up beach balls. I guess that's to simulate tiring out but it's annoying that every single pitcher poops out at the same time.The home run derby is like the rest of the game: fun at first but ultimately dull.I returned this game after only four days. There was no way I was going to hold on to such a dud."
4,High Heat Baseball 2003 is okay,I think this is a good game compared to Baseball Advance. I play this game so much. The only thing is they don't record saves(as baseball) There is season Exhibition Or Playoffs. This game is really enjoyable. It was my first baseball game and Curt Schilling(2001 World Serries MVP) is the spoke's person for every High Heat sold a portion of it will go to charity.
3,"okay, but not quite the caliber of the computer and console","I have all 3 baseball games for the gameboy advance, and was hoping for more from All Star Baseball. Like High Heat, there is only 1 true stadium; all the others are just background pictures. That's one of the cool things about Baseball Advance, even though there are only 4 stadiums, they're the best ones. 2 classic (Fenway, Wrigley) and 2 new (Safeco and Pac Bell). Even with last year rosters, baseball advance has the best gameplay. High Heat 2003 for the computer is the best bar none, but for the gameboy advance not quite."
3,Jacob's Review,This game is exciting. It got too easy once (I was 156-6 with the Giants. Bonds hit 90 home-runs) but I am experimenting with other teams(e.g. Red Sox). I would rent or borrow this game. It does get addicting.P.S. Randy Johnson and Curt Shilling aren't that great.
1,Very poor game.,"I'm an older gamer that bought the GBA to use while traveling. I first bought the High Heat game for the GBA because I own the PC version but I was very unhappy to see how poorly the game played on the GBA. I then took it back and traded it for the baseball advance game, which is 100 times better.DO NOT BUY - trust me!"
3,It is the old Game Port interface Gravis Game pad,"It is the old Game Port interface Gravis Game pad. Nothing special, cheap constructed but it works like the ones of yesteryear. I am giving it 3 starts because I made the mistake thinking it was USB and found it is not."
2,D-pad sucks,"I've had this gamepad for a while, before which I had an original Gravis gamepad (not pro). The problem with the old one was that it didn't have enough buttons. But, well, let me say this gamepad's direction pad doesn't cut the mustard. Although my old one wasn't great, this one has become so sloppy with time so as to be unusable. Trying to play emulator games with it has become an exercise in frustration. So I recommend you try something with a more precise and durable direction pad. Additionally, I've found my pad's gameport connector to be a bit flaky."
2,"craptacular, and i mean that from the bottom of my heart","I bought this gamepad because it was inexpensive, and I guess I got what I paid for. The d-pad is lousy, like everyone says. I can't get it to calibrate correctly with my SNES emulator. It works, but not with the precision that Gaming Pros demand. Oh, and the chintzy little screw-on joystick broke within one hour of use. Sigh."
3,"Cheap, works with emulators. Good starting pad.","This is the common gamepad among emu-geeks. Its got the basics, 4 candy colored buttons, start and select (where they SHOULD be) and shoulder buttons, but it has two more... hmm, I'd map those to the Save State / Load State function in ZSNES (yes, I'm a cheater). The d-pad is odd though, its a little lumpy, not like the old ""cross"" from the Snes/Sega days and there's a screw-whole for some kinda stick add-on. That doesn't magically make it analog though. This is a fine pad for just ONE thing, but if you wanna do more than just NES or SNES emu's, get a Lik-Sang adapter and dig any standard or aftermarket PS1/PS2 pad outta the closet. Also download Joy2Key (its free) and you'll be able to map keys to buttons and mouse to analog stick. And yes, you CAN play PSX games on PC... IF your machine is fast enough. The adapter also supports the Rumble Motors in your Dual Shock pads."
2,Poor Precision,"After having this gamepad for 2 months, I am ready to throw it in the garbage. The layout is fine, but the D-pad has 2 major flaws:1) it is TERRIBLY imprecise. In playing Madden Football it is almost impossible to make your guy run straight. The slightest movement sends him off in a diagonal direction. Can't run in the open field without going left and right or going out of bounds. VERY annoying.2) The 2nd big problem is the screw hole where the worthless joystick screws in. I had to put a piece of tape over it because it was digging into my thumb so bad i was almost bleeding!Spend your $$ on something else."
2,"Nice Design, But MAJOR flaw where it really counts","The shape and size of this gamepad is just great - and the layout is perfect for regular PC gaming or most video game console emulators. Unfortunately, the directional pad is awful. Not precise at all, you pretty much have too look at it and slam the direction you're going for multiple times in order to get any sort of reliability. Casually hitting UP can sometimes lean too far to the right and cause you to go sideways. It's just a mess, especially if you're using an emulator. This is decently priced and nicely laid out, but the D-Pad is way too sloppy. There is a joystick you can screw into it, but that's even more awkward and unreliable. Shame."
4,Pretty Good,"I got the SNL Volume 1 CD today, and i personally thought it was pretty good. Although there are a lot of songs that should have made the CD and didn't, what was there was nice to hear. It only cost $4.99, so i thing i got my moneys worth."
1,TWO SONGS AND MEDIOCRE AT THAT!,"Billy Joel and Clapton cuts are ""ok"" picks. The rest are a joke!Paul Simon - If it ain't him and Garfunkel, forget it!Sting - If it ain't the Police, what's the point?Annie Lennox - Eurythmics! Hello!James Taylor, David Bowie, and Tom Petty - Give us at least some good songs!Let's cut to the quick with the rest...here's the throw aways regardless of material - Elvis Costello, Dave Matthews, Grateful Dead, Counting Crows, Lenny Kravitz, Jewel, and Randy Newman. These take up almost half of the CD...pretty lame."
2,Let the people choose...,"There are so many great performances not included on Volumes 1 and 2 that I don't even know where to begin but here's a short list just off the top of my head: Jackson Browne (1977, Running on Empty, The Pretender); The Band (playing a three song set!); Nirvana (killer version of Smells Like Teen Spirit); Suzanne Vega (Luka); 10,000 Maniacs (first appearance in 1987); Neil Young (Rocking In The Free World); Pearl Jam (Alive); Keith Richards (1987 solo album). I could go on for an hour...I agree with another reviewer that these performances should also be put out on DVD. However here's another idea: put EVERY SNL musical performance out on one of the new online music services like iTunes and let the fans buy the performances they want! I'd pay to construct my perfect SNL musical guests CD. Think about it."
3,There's A Lot Missing,"SNL Volumes 1 and 2 are terribly incomplete. In many cases, I was disappointed. All right, this CD includes Elvis Costello's infamous ""Radio Radio."" Lenny Kravitz's and Anne Lennox's selections are really good. But, for the most part, this CD and its follow on contain Ho Hum material from some really good artists.Face it, the folks who put these two CDs out (Volumes 1 and 2) should have included the performances of The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and Paul Simon (""Here Comes the Sun"" and ""Homeward Bound""), Patti Smith (""Gloria""), Frank Zappa, and other acts that left a lasting impression on Saturday Night Live.The selection of material could have been a lot better, and a lot more entertaining. Maybe Volume 3 (if it is ever released) will correct the mostly lackluster performances of the previous two volumes. Come on. . . Give us a little more for our money!"
2,Snoozerama,"I borrowed this CD from our local public library. They can have it back soon. Good selection of artists giving TV performances of material that you can get in mainly superior studio (or other live) versions. I never was a huge fan of the ""musical guest"" segment of SNL, a show I tuned out of quite a few years ago, anyway.Even at 39 cents + shipping for a used copy, this CD is no bargain. Paul Simon/Ladysmith lead off the disc nicely, followed by five unremarkable tracks, including a tried-sound Clapton wheezing out ""Wonderful Tonight,"" until Jewel sparkles on ""Who Will Save Your Soul.""Glad I just borrowed the thing and didn't buy it to add to my already shelf-busting collection."
1,What a let down!!!,"The real talent from SNL (cast and guest stars) is NOT included in this CD - or in Vol. 2. Where was the Blues Brothers singing ""Soul Man"" or Queen singing ""That Thing Called Love""? How about Lyle Lovett or Eurythmics? I wish I had my money back."
1,Lame,"Where`s FEAR? Oh yeah, the only thing SNL is afraid of showing. Not-so-commercial hardcore punk with a drunk bunch of skinhead fans destroying the place. Not only does FEAR kick some serious a**, their (not quite) 15 minutes of fame was the best thing ever to come out of SNL, thanks to Belushi. Wait, that makes it 2. Oh well.The Costello performance is great though."
1,Save your money,After hearing how great the method of Total Biology emotional clearing was from a friend of mine I looked forward to receiving the DVD in order to gain some insights into how it worked and how to apply it to my own life. This DVD supplied none of that and was an absolute joke. The author stumbles along with very poor English attempting to describe some cases that he had worked with in very simple terms and giving no structure or form as to how Total Biology is to be practiced or applied. The interviewer is no help at all and it becomes painfully obvious after the first 5 minutes that they needed the help of a translator. This DVD is a waste of money and the worst purchasing decision I have made in decades...you have been warned. It became the butt of jokes for days afterwards by the 4 of us that sat down to view it. It was so poor that it has forced me into writing this review - my first ever - in order to warn potential buyers.
4,"Honest and direct, without any frills","""A Flash in the Mirror"" is a collection of traditional Lakotah songs. Kevin Locke's style of flute playing is very distinct from Karlos Nakai's long drawn out flute tones. Kevin's playing sounds more personal and expressive. He makes a single flute sound like multiple voices singing together. I would really like to hear Kevin Locke perform live to see how he makes so many wonderful sounds from the flute. The only criticism I have is that the recording is a bit bright and forward, but I still keep coming back to this recording to listen to the talented playing, and the places and people the songs express. Note: This recording is of a single flute only, it does not have nature sounds and singing like ""The First Flute."""
3,These are alright,"These panniers were an impulse buy because I could get them shipped to me overnight for a longer bike ride coming up. When they arrived they were a bit smaller than I had expected. I would also recommend someone to buy waterproof panniers, which these are not. It only has the main pouch and a pocket in the lid, so finding things on the road is a pain.The system it uses to attach to your bike is very simple, so if that's what you're looking for, great. However, this system entails two clips to hold the panniers on my back rack and sometimes one of them will fall off leaving my pannier hanging by one.Would I recommend these panniers? No. Would I recommend panniers in general? Yes (that is why I gave it 3 stars). It sure beats wearing a backpack and having a huge sweat stain on your back all day :)"
