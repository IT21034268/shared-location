5,What a nice ring!,I just received this ring and it is adorable. It is dainty and was just what I was looking for. A nice accent to a solitare ring. The stones looked great even with a loop. A great price for .50 ct.!
5,This product cannot be surpassed!,"The product performs as well as the mfg says it does. I have never been disappointed. We purchased 6 units for our swim team. They have been dropped, baked and used heavley. The button from one came up missing. We called customer service and they sent us TWO at no charge! I luv it!"
2,Poor Performer,"After reveiwing a number of two-way radios, I decided to buy the Motorola 280 SLK because of Motorola's reputation in commercial communications. The first time I used the radios I had trouble with reception. The range was exremely poor even on a flat surface like a beach. The transmissions tend to have a lot of static. The push-to-talk button is very awkward and there is usualy a slight delay between the time you press the transmit button and the time you can begin speaking. I recently took my 280 SLK skiing and had the same troubles I had encountered at the beach. Some friends using Kenwood radios had no trouble at all on the mountain. I would recommend a different radio at a lower price."
3,Works fairly well,"These units work well over short distances; However, the battery needs to be charged every few days, even when the phone is not being used. One has to keep a regular charging schedule, or the units will not work when you need them."
2,Infamous Aircaraft,"The book is misnamed. There were very little about ""Dangerous designs and their vices"" and I was disappointed with it. I found some sections interesting but becasue of the title I was expecting so much more. The section on early Russian jets was the part I enjoyed the most. Just wish the author had talked about the vices of those aricraft."
1,"No better than an ""in the box"" wire antenna","I found this dipole antenna to provide equal or worse reception when compared to the ""in the box"" wire antenna that came with my shelf stereo system."
4,LG Chocolate VX8500/ VX9400 White Chocolate Car Charger / Vehicle Charger,"This product is really great for only 1 dollar. Most off-brand phone charger that I have bought have ruined my phone. The cord could be a little longer, but otherwise it's a good charger."
5,Great replacement product for my Kenmore!,Perfect replacement product for my Kenmore refrigerator!!! Fits perfectly and does what it's supposed to do; produce clean and clear filtered water.
3,Restricted Flow,"THe flow after installing this filter seems to be more resticted than the one I had installed previously. It takes so much longer to fill a glass with water. I bought this one on Amazon because the price was So much better than buying one from Sears...which I think was $45 +. Anyway, it seesm to work, albeit much more slowly."
5,Filter,It is just what it says it is. It is very nice to find this product cheaper than any store around.
4,Good value for product.,"If you are in need of one of these Water Filters then this is probably the best place to purchase from. I have been to several locations as well as wholesalers to get these at a reduced rate and this is the best value for the product itself. As far as the function of the filters, they work pretty well and last a decent amount of time. About the only real problem I have with them is that once they go they really stop working at all and the taste of your water is fairly evident, at least where I live."
5,Cost effective solution,The items were a perfect fit and were easy to install. These were the most cost effective solution that met the requirements.
5,WORKS!,not sure what i can say bad about this one.. i bought two for my parents' fridge and it works fine .. no problems .. NO COMPLAINTS FROM PARENTS = HAPPY SON :)
1,I got used filters and found out too late to return. Who would sell used filters? Ripp-off!!,"I bought these 2-pack in July as soon as I installed my last filter. Three months later, I open this package to find that both of the filters are used, both of them. It was in the original box and had the stem covers, but the filters were used. I looked into returning them and discovered that I can't. I feel totally ripped-off! Who would sell used water filters?? Now what? I bought them because it had the Amazon LLC as the seller. My faith in them is greatly diminished."
1,One Out of Two Went Pop.,"I read the reviews and figured my odds were about 1 in 20 of getting a ""funny"" filter.The twin pack arrived. I pulled the first pair of covers off and . . . nothing. No ""pop"", no water. Filter #2 though ""pop""-ed like a can of soda being opened. I don't see water, but it looked like something sprayed out when it ""pop""-ed. Rats!Do we know for sure that the ones that do this are used? Why would a used filter go ""pop"". I'd sooner think it was they way they were packaged at the factory (positive pressure to keep dirt and dust out) and was a sign of freshness.I hate returning these, but afraid to keep them.I do not recommend these if they are going to be this much trouble!"
1,I received a used filter,"I'm sorry for rating 1 star a product which I think is great. But I received a used filter.My package was not sealed. I'm not necessarily blaming Amazon. I think somebody ordered a new one, returned an old one instead (pretending to be the new one) and Amazon resold the old one assuming the previous return was legit and fair. It is not worth the trouble for me to return the product to Amazon ($25), but I'll not buy consumables online anymore."
1,Worthless,"When I moved into my new apt the filter needed to be replaced so I bought this twin pack. They are worthless. I followed the instructions for installation and flushing. Not only does the water dispense at a painfully slow pace but it actually raises the parts per million from 255(tap) to 350. While I couldn't tell if the ""filtered"" water tasted any worse than the tap water it certainly didn't taste any better.I'll stick to my Zero Water pitcher."
1,DEFECTIVE & EXTREMELY BAD QUALITY FILTERS.,THE FILTERS WERE DEFECTIVE. THE WATER STOPPED FLOWING THROUGH THE FIRST ONE IN 4 WEEKS AND THE SECOND ONE IN 3 WEEKS !! THE WATER USAGE WAS LESS THAN NORMAL AS MY FAMILY WAS AWAY ON VACATION. I HAVE HAD THIS REFRIGERATOR FOR SEVEN YEARS AND HAVE ROUTINELY REPLACED THEM AFTER EVERY 4 TO 5 MONTHS. NEVER HAVE I HAD THEM GO BAD SO SOON. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! THERE ARE MANY MORE REPUTABLE VENDORS TO CHOOSE FROM. DO NOT GET BURNT LIKE ME.When I contacted amazon they promptly replaced it.***** Immediately check filters for foul smell and make sure they are not used.*****No comments on replacement filters since I have not used it yet.
1,Clogged in just three months,I replaced this just three months ago and already the water flow has dwindled to a mere trickle. These things aren't exactly cheap either.
3,tasted fishy,"Easy to install. Good price. However, initially, taste of water was fishy and stayed that way for about 2 weeks. Have used this brand of filter before without any complaints. Will not order this again through Amazon. The whole idea is not to just filter your water of impurities, but to improve it's flavor."
1,Not satisfied,"I bought this filter and installed after reading a couple of poor reviews, my daughter was the first to complain the water tasted funny, and my wife was quick to agree, I feel I wasted my money, as we just bought a new one from the store and threw this one away. Absolutley Do Not waste your money on any of these filters !!!"
1,BEWARE!!!!,"Yesterday I replaced the Water Filter yesterday and after flushing for 3 minutes the first time and again for another 3 minutes... There were white plastic pieces showing up in the water and it was also in the ice this morning. I replaced the Water Filter with the 2nd Water Filter in the box (2-Pack) and flushed for 3 minutes and the 2nd one works fine and water taste great. I was going to send the Water Filters back, but since i did not install the water Filter the day i got the package, i am no longer in the window of opportunity to send the items back. So i am stuck with a 2-pack where one of the filters does not work. So i basically paid double for my one working water filter. I was going to call the company to see if they would send out a single filter to replace the bad one, but i do not have their contact information and Amazon does not give you the option to contact the seller direclty."
1,Dissapointed with Delivery,"I had ordered this item on 9/21 and it was delivered 10/10. This is the first time I've ever faced this issue - I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years. Delivery lead time was very dissapointing especially since it was shipped out on 9/24. Not sure why it took so long.When the product arrived, the filter box was open and there wasn't any documentation in there - the box said refer instructions in the instruction booklet inside and there wasn't one. the filters also did not seem new - i am not sure if these come wrapped individually.Other than that, I just installed this filter and the water flow is not continuous, I am hoping that with increased usage, the flow will become better. if not, i am returning these filters."
1,NOT HAPPY!!!,I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT BUT SWEET!!!!.i bought this item in sept.....and i already need another one!!!!they are recommended for six months but i only got three out of it...?????the original that came with the fridge lasted 6 months.....and also the water started crawling out about a month ago and i had to live with it until the fridge alerted me it was time to change it....not happy!!!!
5,BUY HERE,"Price half of what Sear's wanted (my ""Kenmore"" refrigerator is identical to the ""Kitchenaid"", both manufactured by Whirlpool) for the same filter. Merchandise received was genuine Whirlpool, not aftermarket."
5,Great Water Filter,Bought this for my KitchenAid side by side refrigerator and could not be happier. Water tastes great and the filters fit perfectly. Great price too!
4,Water filter do-it-yourself vs. buy it at Sears.,I just bought two water filters for my refrigerator for the price of just one at the Sears store.This works better for me.
4,Easy out easy in,Have used this filter for about 3 an one half years now and each time I remove the old and insert the new one I'm surprised by how easy it is to do. Somehow makes the water taste better. I gave it four stars because I feel it should last a year for $36 and change not 6 months.
4,great product,"I've been waiting for a while to find a cheaper replacement for the filter. This one did the job. I was tired of paying $60+ at Sear's for the ""Ultimate II"" version of this same filter. Got it for half the price. Even subscribed to get it every six months without having to think about it. Thanks!"
4,Water Filter,"I was leery of ordering a water filter for my Kenmore Elite refrigerator (worried it would not fit). The price was way better than going to Sears to purchase a filter, so I ordered one from amazon. Shipping was on time I've had no problems with the new filters and I plan on buying more in the future."
5,Good buy,"Very pleased with the water filter, as I have ordered it before from Amazon. The purchase was cost effective.I would definitely order again."
5,Great value,Buying the water filter on Amazon is such a good buy! My husband saw the same filters elsewhere and you only got 1 for the same price. We have 7 people in our home and we use a lot of water and ice thru the fridge...we can go through a couple of these filters in a year...this makes it so much more affordable.
2,Yuk,"These filters impart a foul chemical taste to the water and ice cubes for the first couple of weeks. I thought I got a bad batch, but I experienced the same thing the second time I ordered them. I intend to try another brand next time if I can find one.Yes, I did flush it first as instructed."
2,Not what it seems,"Although there is no mention of it in Amazon's product description, the box was clearly labeled: NOT FOR HI FLOW REFRIGERATORS (which my refrigerator is). It filters water, but the volume of flow to the water dispenser is painfully slow. Next time I will get a different filter."
5,Why go retail?,"These filters fit my Kenmore refrigerator. This is the second time I have ordered them and am very happy with their performance. I replace one filter every 6 months so these will last me all year. If I were to buy them in the store, I would be paying over $45 each. Why would I do that?"
5,good water filter,A very good water filter at a great price. This one is actually better than the original. Shipping was really fast also. Will buy again.
5,Highly recommended - I buy it from Amazon every time!!,"Priced right and works great! I change out the filter on my Whirlpool side-by-side fridge every 6 months, as recommended, and it usually lasts a little longer than that anyway! So, I will be back in about 5 months to purchase it again! Fantastic price, fast shipping, and definitely makes a big difference when the filter is at the end of its lifespan."
5,Great filter for refrigerator,"Easy to install in our Sears refrigerator and produces good, fresh water for 6-9 months per filter. Convenient double pack."
3,"Doesn't ""Taste"" as Good as my old one?",For some reason this doesn't filter out the bad taste in the water like my old one and it's the same brand and number??? I will be adding a 3 filter setup before this to filter out fluoride and other harmful things anyway but I don't know why it doesn't work as well.Good price though. :p
5,Great Price!,"great price, filters look just like the ones I paid almost double for last time. Love Amazon and the savings for customers!"
4,water filters,"Filters are as good as advertised,I am satisfied with the product,and thankthe seller for the speedy delivery."
4,Whirlpool fridge water filter,"this is a good product well worth the money. installs very easily and makes your drinking water and ice cubes taste much better than tap water.Whirlpool 4396710P KitchenAid PUR Push Button Cyst-Reducing, Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water Filter, 2-Pack"
5,Best price and great quality,Last about 9 months and costs about ten cents a day. Good seal with no water leakage. I will stick with this brand.
4,Quick and easy perfect fit,"What can I say, having a filter on the frig keeps the ice and water tasting better no doubt. However, having to changeout the filter every six months is like having your oil changed in your car. Cha..ching every 6 months for 30 bucks, I would have given 5 starts if I could buy these filter for under 20 each. But as the saying goes ""they got you by the short hairs"" and so you must pay."
4,I guess it works,I have a well so hopefully this is preventing me from getting sick. How can anyone tell how well it really works? All I can say is I'm not sick.
4,Tried both filters for Whirlpool; works fine,"My Whirlpool is a ""fastfill"" and I tried these cyst-reducing slow-fill filters because at the time for some reason they were cheaper, and looked just the same. I think they do slow down the fill a little bit, but they are apparently filter more so I guess its a trade-off. If you have questionable water it would certainly be worth it. Since they both work, I now buy whichever one's cheaper. I DO wish they'd come out with one that took out salts, and yes -- even flouride which I do not consider a benefit."
3,Whirpool Water Filter,"This was the best price deal I was able to find for my side by side Kenmore refrigerator. According to product description this item should have up to 6+ levels of filtering, which should be much better from the one I ordered about a year ago. However, Item I received was different from what was advertised, actually exactly the same that I ordered a year ago with only a few levels of filtering.Contacting Amazon didn't help anyhow. Buying filter in local Sears store for 2X price was not an option. So, I just had to use the one I ordered also, because items was delivered with delays and I ran out of time.Anyway, I just want to share this for you to keep in mind when you order this item."
3,Check to see if it's used.,"People like to return used filters. Check to see if yours is used. If it has had water in it in the past it will be noticable. If it has had water and the individual has attempted to drain the water, the inside of the filter will feel ""sloshy"" like jello. It should feel light and no indication water has ever been in it."
2,"Whirlpool 4396710 KitchenAid PUR - Water Filter, 1-Pack","The shipping was quick but when I opened the red cover I heard the pop sound and there was water or some liquid inside. I read other reviews which states that it is used one if it makes the pop sound, which it did. I am not going to buy another one of this."
2,Refrigerator filters,"I recently purchased a 2-pack of refrigerator filter replacements - Whirlpool 4396710P KitchenAid PUR Push Button Cyst-Reducing, Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water Filter. After installation, the water and ice continued to show cloudiness and a bad taste for over 2 weeks. I have installed the second filter this morning and the water seems clearer. I will see how the second filter behaves, but it is turning out to be an expensive filter change."
1,Water filtered has strong chemical taste.,"Although we had Whirlpool filters in our new refrigerator prior to ordering these, the flavor of the water and ice is so bad now that I am going to have to replace these as quickly as possible. I didn't have any idea that ""same brand"" filters could vary so much. The price was better than some, but the quality has been so poor that no price is reasonable."
5,instead of kenmore 9030 i use this--exact same thing and way less,I was looking for a ceap alternitive for my kenmore and came accross this--its the exact same thing only labeled differant. Was perfect for my kanmore part #9030. only thing cheap about it is price no complaints at all will buy more.
1,will not buy again,"Bought this 2 pack in October. Had to replace the first one after two months, and replaced the second one after one month. This filter significantly reduced our water flow also. I do not know why these don't last as long. I would like to know if others have had same problem."
1,Defective Product,I have bought this product twice before with no issues. Received most recent package and when filters were installed one of the filters was defective and did not hold a seal and water leaked out. I returned the product back to amazon for a replacement and the same thing accord a second time. I finally decided to buy the product at sears (at twice the price) and both filters work perfectly.
3,instructions,"The only shortfalls I see in this system are that the instructions don't tell you you can leave the water on (you can), and the replace indicator is time based (6 months) not based on contamination or volume of water filtered."
4,What more to say?,"The selection of filters is a little confusing. This one is not the exact one which came original in the fridge, but it IS the correct one. It is not stocked in the big box store in town, so ordering it was a fine alternative. The price is OK, competitive after shipping, but no great deal. The filter was delivered very quickly."
4,Easy filter replacement,I live in a hard water area so an efficient filter on my ice maker is very important. These filters are identical to the original equipment for my kitchen aid fridge. Fitting the replacement is very simple and quick - just check it out in your manual. The two pack is very good value.
5,Perfect substitute,"This filter is the perfect substitute for the factory installed filter in our Kitchen Aid refrigerator. It makes sense when you compare the impurities that the standard versus the enhanced filter will eliminate or minimize.Also, the price at Amazon can't be beat."
3,Could last longer,These water filters are very expensive. We use maybe 1/2 gallon of water a day and it lasts only 2-3 months.
5,As advertised,"Product arrived safely in reasonable time. No surprises, correct item, repeat purchase. It's just me in the home, so I run the same filter about a year instead of the prescribed 6 months. It maintains good flow at least that long for me."
5,"Good price, quality filter.","Works great and vendor had the best price. I would buy here again, but will always search the web for the best price."
4,extra filtering,My refrigator had th capacity to give extra filtration to our water. This also help keep out any material missed by the first filter.
5,Whirlpool Water Goodness,"The local stores charge an arm and leg for water filters. Once you know what model number you need order them at Amazon.com. I order three at a time and write the date on them so I know when its time to change. On a side note I will tell you that you can wait a couple months past the stated time window on the product. We generally change after 9 months. Considering it takes a little longer to get water out of them, it out weighs the price you pay up front. Still a great bargain."
4,refrigerator filter replacement,amazon allowed us to easily find the part that we needed and purchase it for a reasonable price.the only thing that would have been helpful would have been a link to something which showed for which refrigerators the filter was appropriate - i needed to find an old receipt for a previous purchase to id it.
1,Are these used items?,"Are these used ? I recieved them Jan 24, 2012. They had scratches on marks all over them . Are they used or new . I connected them to the fridge . The water wasnt flowing fast . I think i will just throw them away and go and buy new ones at Sears."
1,Great Filter Poor packaging,The package arrived with the box being crushed on one side. The side where the filters were. Very poor packaging as the space was not filled so the product would not move or be damaged.
1,frig filter,"Sent it back, didn't need.In the past, this product has worked fine. But our water is cut off to the frig now, because it started leaking."
1,Amazon is shipping used filters,"The filter arrived with the wrong color cap - blue, while new ones are red. Water also dripped from the top and the packaging did not fit over the filter like it does on a new one. This is disgusting. I returned it and canceled my subscription.To be clear, when new, the filters are fine. This is a horrible situation that Amazon continues to ignore, despite dozens of similar reviews."
3,"Kind of expansive for Refrigerator filter, last only about 3 month","Wish it lasts longer for the price, it suggest changing it for 6 months, but after about 3 months we can taste the different."
3,Same as 4396841,"This filter is just fine, but buy the 4396841 for the same price. It is the same physical filter housing with a better filter cartridge inside. Yes, the 4396841 has lower gallon capacity but that is because it filters out finer ""stuff"". Read the two labels."
5,Fast delivery and great value,"Obviously, this is an item that you have to get from PUR and a lot of places online sell these but when you consider Amazon's base price and free shipping from Prime it makes a basic item that you have to have great by value and cost since it was very well priced the day I purchased and had free shipping."
5,Best price around,Amazon is the best place to buy these. The two pack is a great value. We have well water at our house and these filters are great.
5,Great deal!,Great deal for the new fridges with the filter that you HAVE to change every six months.
5,whirlpool filters-GREAT!,"These filters do a wonderful job and are very reliable. And best of all Amazon has the best price. Once again, Amazon didn't let me down. Thank you."
5,Great replacement for my Kenmoore fridge,I am so glad I researched more about the filter I originally looked at from Sears. I can't believe I bought 2 for the price of 1! Replacing the old one was a breeze. We immediately noticed the difference in the taste of our water. Will definitely order this again next year!
2,Wrong model. Didn't do the trick.,"I wish there were a better way of describing these filters. I ordered these after doing some (obviously not enough) research, and they were the wrong type. A total nuisance. I am more inclined to blame the manufacturer of the refrigerator than the seller of these filters. By the way, they are the actual Whirlpool product, and not a generic."
5,It works on my Kenmore Elite,"I read the reviews how it worked on Kenmore Elite. What Kenmore recommends for filter is much more expensive. I have been using them in the past 3 years, about 10 of them and they worked great."
5,Refrigerator filter,"Best price on the internet or in the stores. Buy the two pack, you will need them. I replace my filter every 4-5 months."
5,works,It works plain and simple. I would buy this again. I am going to have to. The water has a clean taste.
5,Great product...Excellent price,"You cant go wrong. The price of these in stores are very pricy and thats usually just for one, but your pretty much getting 2 for the price of 1...give or take, great buy and will buy more when I need to"
4,Sometimes easy is more expensive,"Easy to remove and replace with a new filter. But like its other quality competitors, I think it costs more than it should."
4,Love the price and the idea that I'm drinking better water,"I get these all the time, it's nice to know that the water I'm drinking and cooking with is filtered. The water in my area is hard and since I can't afford water treatment this is the next best thing."
3,not what I was hoping for,This filter is o.k. for filtering bad stuff but I was hoping for clear ice.Instead ice is white. When ice has melted there are little floaty things in it. I'm still looking for a filter that will make clear ice.
5,Perfect,"Purchase through Amazon was seamless and easy. The product showed up when it was supposed to. The filters (2 pack for $56) I bought are exactly what was in the refrigerator already from new. So, it fits/works perfectly.At nearly a 60% discount, I will most certainly buy this product again through Amazon - If you can find it cheaper from a reputable source, please post it so we can all enjoy the savings. Otherwise - this has got to be the deal of the day..."
5,Fits my Kenmore Elite which takes the Sears filter 9030,"This filter fits my Kenmore Elite side by side which takes the Sears 9030 filter and at almost half the price. The only difference in this filter is it does not say Stage II or Kenmore. The water tastes exactly the same to me as when I used the Sears brand and I am very aware of the water taste since we have hard, extremely chlorinated water in my area. I wish I had found these filters - 4 Sears brand filters ago ... serious $$$ savings!"
5,perfect fit,"Perfect fit for a Kenmore side-by-side from Sears. Dunno why Sears wants more for the same filter. The price for this dual pack beats most local store (Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) as major online stores. This is my second batch of filters. I'll be getting them again when I'm out."
4,Good price,"I found this product have better price on Amazon, compared to the stores.I don't think it really lasts 6 months, since my fridge will state to replace in a month or so (with therate of the status changes we have dropped down to good status in 3 months)."
5,"Great value, fast arrival for my frige",The two filers came in faster than I thought (in 4 days on free shipping as well) and it worked perfectly for my Kenmoore frige(Kenmore refrigerator (W10151336A) White Kenmore 25.4 cu. ft. Side-by-Side Refrigerator w/ PUR Water Filtration).It was great in value compared to other resellers on the Internet and SEARS (Sear sold the filer for $49.99 each). I got two as bundle for less than $60.I will continue get the filters from Amazon next time.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,Push your button discard the filter and put the tray and or the cap back in your water will not be filterd
1,Skip PUR...spend $5 and get the whirlpool filter,"As soon as we changed out our whirlpool filter with the PUR filter, we noticed a change in the quality of water. In fact, my family has switched to drinking tap water over the filtered water until I change the filter. The water has a definite chemical/mineral taste after passing thru this filter. The problem is, after the first one -- I thought 'maybe it's a bad filter'... so I replaced it after 2 months. (Fortunately, I'd bought 2). Now...sorry to say, the filter is jammed and the button will not loosen it to replace. So, saving $5.00 for the PUR replacement, I've gone thru 2 filters in 6 months, and now will need to pay an appliance repair company to come and dislodge the faulty filter. Save yourself the trouble...buy the real thing. Wish I had."
1,Waste of money - did nothing for Total Dissolved Solids,"Our existing filter was the original unit which came with our Sears Elite Side by Side 1.5 years ago. I am so disgusted with myself for having wasted $56. The water coming out of the refrigerator after installing the new filter tests exactly the same as the tap water. Yes, all I'm using is a TDS tester but the filter claims to reduce solids. My water tests 429 from the faucet and 430 from the refrigerator. I should've kept the $56 and applied it towards a reverse osmosis system. I'll just keep using my $30 Zerowater carafe from a department store which reads 000-007 on the TDS tester until I can afford a RO system.Whirlpool 4396710P PUR Side-by-Side Refrigerator Push Button Cyst Reducing Water Filter, 2-Pack"
1,Signature required??? For water filters?,This is absurd - I work and can't sign for these filters and it is ludicrous for you to expect me to - UPS will return them to you ...I will not purchase from you again..
5,A little cheaper than I could find in the store,I looked at various sites and found I couldn't do any better in price than on Amazon.
5,pure ease,I have had a lot of visitors and everyone wants to know why our water taste so good. These filters make bottle water a thing of the past.
4,Saved me a trip to sears and some $,Same as the filter I buy at sears for less $$.. And I saved the time and the effort of a trip to sears! Product arrived in good condition and on time...
2,only a carbon filter... a really expensive one,"My unfiltered water is 350ppm, my filtered water when put through this PUR filter is 350ppm... I don't know why everyone is so impressed it is only a carbon filter with no mechanical filtration."
4,"Good, but pricy","I have a Kitchen Aid side-by-side and have used this water filters with it over the past few years. The 2-pack use to cost $34 last year, but now is $54. It's a good product, but $54 for two water filters is a bit pricy. Not sure why it's $20 more ($10 per filter) than last year."
4,as advertised,just what I needed for my fridge. I just wish there was a way to tell (some kind of indicator) if it is used once you take the covers off. If you have the old one out and the new one uncapped and get an interruption...you might find yourself wondering which is the used one and which is the new one (as I did)....
5,Great value,"OEM replacements for our Whirlpool refrigerator. No issues, work great. This is the newer model with better filtering. Recently a plumber was at our house and we offered him a drink of water. He asked if we had an RO unit because the water tasted so good. The city water in Phoenix taste so awful these filters make an enormous difference."
5,Great Product Great Price!,Needed a replacement water filter for my refrigerator. The cheapest I could find it by ten dollars was on amazon.com. It is a filter and does its job buy why pay too much for something that you can get here for much cheaper.
5,Whirlpool Replacement Filter,I have used this filter for several years with no problems. They last as long as suggested by the manufacturer.
3,No cysts yet,"I don't know what cysts I'm reducing, but I needed a fridge filter & these filters do the trick just fine."
4,Whirlpool PUR filter,"There's not a whole lot to say - I need a new filter every 6 months or so and this is the model required for my fridge. The water tastes fine after being filtered. There is definitely still mineral left as I get a lot of scale/build up on spout on the fridge, but our water is very hard."
5,Good,"It is so much easier to buy it on amazon's subscribe and save. It saves the hassle of remembering to change the filter every 6 months. Also, cheaper online."
5,Great product!,This product came in just as expected. I opted for the scheduled replacement because I can never seem to get around to ordering them when I should and the wife gets very angry! This will be very helpful. The only suggestion is to run several glasses of water through it before you drink the first glass. We learned the hard way that the first glass is salty because of the filtration.
5,Great tasting water from our frig with these filters...,"These filters are long-lasting, and provide great tasting drinking water from our refrigerator. Chlorine aftertaste... gone! Despite the instructions to replace every 6 months, we get well over a year's use from each filter. We simply reset the 6 month timing indicator on our frig. The filter's lifespan probably depends on how gunky your water is. It's been really nice not having to buy bottled drinking water anymore."
5,Necessary to purify your water.,"There's really not much to say about these filters, other than they are necessary if you use your refrigerator water/ice dispenser a lot like we do. We drink lots of water and make our coffee using the fridge dispenser, so we want our water as pure as can be. The filters last a long time and install easily. Amazon has the best price going, especially on this two-pack. It's nice to have that back-up handy when the little ""Replace"" light turns on. A recommended buy."
2,Our tap water is better,"We are very blessed to have some of the cleanest tap water there is, I put this in flushed the 2 gallons of water through it an it still taste funny."
3,Disappointed!!,"I have been very impressed with past purchases from Amazon. This purchase, in my opinion, had HIGH POSTAGE, and took more than 10 days to arrive. I will be looking for an alternative in the future . . ."
4,"Product good, shipment bad","The product works fine. It took more than a week longer to receive it and there was no way to track it past a certain point. I was told by Amazon to call the shipper, but I could not find the shipper information anywhere. Then I was told to start calling the post office to see if they had the package. Once we finally received it, it was in fine shape and works fine. It was just frustrating getting to that point."
5,"Don't have a choice, but works fine","This is the only filter that fits my fridge, so there is no alternative. However, this one seems to do the job well. No odors or tastes in our water."
5,"Whirlpool Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water Filter, 2-Pack","Whirlpool 4396710P KitchenAid PUR Push Button Cyst-Reducing, Side-by-Side Refrigerator Water Filter, is identical with the Sears filter that cost twice as much."
5,Recommended product. Works great,We regularly change out the filter in our fridge and these are fairly expensive if I purchased them locally. They are easy to install too.
5,Exact Match for my Kenmore 5044 Fridge,"I have a Sears Kenmore Elite Model 5044 that uses Sears Item#04609030000 for a replacement filter. Sears wants $54 for one filter... OUCH! This is an exact match that works perfectly.Some poeple have mentioned restricted water flow in their reviews but we have very good water flow with this replacement and excellent tasting water. I do suggest that you run your water as suggested in the directions for a couple of minutes to get any air and sediment out of the line after changing the filter.Don't waste your money on bottled water, just drink filtered :)."
5,works great,I used this for our Kenmore Elite fridge and it fits perfect for a much better price than the ones at Sears
5,Great Filter,"Filter did a good job, once you ran enough water through it. Too bad the fridge (only 2 years old) quit not even one month after purchasing this filter. Will not buy another Kenmore Elite. At least Sears took care of us and replaced the lemon (luckily we had spent the extra money on the extended warranty). The Samsung that we replaced it will takes a different filter - but LOVE THE NEW FRIDGE!"
5,Exactly what I expected,I've make this order several times before so I know what to expect (and this time was no different). Order arrived quickly and contained exactly what I expected.
2,Only removes chlorine and not much else.,"We have used 3 of these in the last 18 months and still had bad water. It turns out they only reduced the chlorine taste. It did not remove any sediment (particulates, class 1) or any of the other stuff it claims. I had the water in our home tested by 3 different labs, including the local water company, and all tests showed little to no reduction in anything other than chlorine versus our regular tap water. $33.99 carbon filter? No thanks. Installed an RO system and pulled this from our fridge. Invest in a real Reverse Osmosis System is my recommendation."
3,"Works fine, but costs too much","Received this filter quickly from Amazon which had it at a good price. It works great, but they only work about 4 months and have to be replaced again. This is not a knock against Amazon, but it seems the design life of this filter is a money grab on the part of Whirlpool which is why I only give it 3-stars. Whirlpool needs to either design the filter for longer life or lower the price, and then I would rate it higher."
3,Okay...,"We moved into this house with a refrigerator that required this filter. When we bought the replacement filter neither it nor the manual for the fridge included instructions for replacement. Although a web search got me some instructions, they were not from either manufacturer. now it feels like the new filter is running slower. I don't know if that is the fault of the filter or the way iI installed it."
3,Gross taste at first,"When this filter is first installed, you need to run about 3 gallons of water through it before it starts tasting okay. After that, the water tasts fine and it seems to filter well."
4,Grimson's Good.,"I like this material a lot. It is very authentic and believable, as if the author has been there. It seems to be based on participant observation or at least first hand research. I was a little sorry to note that his later books went vampire. He should have stuck with contemporary fiction. I would read more if it was on Kindle."
2,Not as good as his other novels...,"This is Mr. Grimson's first book and it is rotten. I am sorry to say this because I am a huge Grimson fan (Stainless and Brand New Cherry Flavor are two of the greatest books I have ever read). In this ne'er do well novel, a doctor swallows pills and deals with weird, insane requests from his equally weird, insane patients. It's unmoving and the purpose of the novel is lost on the reader. It lacks all the glamour, sadness, tragedy, and rock'n'roll rebellion of his better writing efforts, Stainless and Brand New Cherry Flavor. Perhaps this one should stay out of print."

1,15 MINUTE CHARGER ONLY LASTS 15 TIMES.,THE ELECTRONICS INSIDE THE 15 MINUTE PANASONIC CHARGER IS NOT DURABLE. IN ORDER TO CHARGE BATTERIES IN 15 MINUTES THE CIRCUITRY IS SO COMPLEX THAT FAILURE IS INEVITABLE IN SHORT ORDER. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.

PANASONIC WON'T STAND BEHIND THIS PRODUCT EITHER.
5,A Walk Down Memory Lane,"I am a long time RUSH fan! I have these concerts on VHS and was glad to get the DVD package! For me it's a time machine having seen the Exit Stage Left Tour as well as Grace Under Pressure Tour! If you are a RUSH fan this is really great stuff. REMEMBER it's old footage from 20 years ago or so! I've read lots of ridiculous comparisons to R30 and RIO. Ummm - lots of technology improvements since then people. So if your expecting HiDEF quality FORGET ABOUT IT. BTW some small people snipe and make fun of hair and clothes - styles change! Thats part of the fun of it - PROGRESS, CHANGE AND GROWTH. I will watch this frequently and enjoy it for what it is! A great snapshot of the history of a great Canadian band!"
3,"Gotta love Rush, but...","I've been a Rush fan since I was a kid and I still am well into my 40s. The concert footage is good but the quality of the DVDs is poor. ""Exit Stage Left"" has loud full sound but the video is pretty poor. (Yes, I understand when and how it was originally recorded.) ""Grace Under Pressure"" and ""A Show of Hands"" has significantly better and very acceptable video quality. But, the Dolby 5.1 audio on these two stinks. It is thin and fades in and out. It doesn't even sound like Dolby 5.1 but more like when my Bose system takes stereo or mono and simulates Dolby 5.1 ...not even that good. In fact the audio is stronger when the camera is in close on Geddy but the sound fades out when the camera pulls back or changes views."
4,"Audio good for most part, video is awful","They spent all their time remixing the audio and no time at all on cleaning up the video. Reminds me of the Peter Gabriel Secret World Live DVD release. The CD mix of the GUP show sounds too heavy on the bass. I have 2 other sources from that show and they sound better actually. Oh well, it's still nice to have these on DVD, and since it's Rush I'll still give it 4 stars."
4,Worth the money,"I feel that this latest Rush release was worth the money. I got to see them play a couple songs that I never saw them play before live, such as Witch Hunt, and Vital Signs. The Moving Picture DVD wasn't the best in clarity due to the lighting, but all aside it was good. The Grace Under Pressure DVD was Rush in there prime. I'm also a musician and I play the bass guitar, and they were very tight, as for the Show of hands, I didn't like the tone of Alex's guitar or Geddy's bass, and Alex played sloppy on La Villa Strangiato and even made a mistake. I didn't enjoy that DVD at all. The CD that came with the set was awesome!!! Like I said, it's not perfect but worth watching. James"
3,Casual Fans Need Not Apply,"The Rush Replay DVD is for die hard fans only - the casual fan need not apply. I was disappointed by the Exit Stage Left video - it was poorly edited, with the cameras constantly shifting away from the main action, and it contained a very different set list than the CD, which, unlike the video, has been available for years. The perfomance of Xanadu was nearly, by itself, worth the cost of the set. Inexplicably, the drum solo in the middle of YYZ was not filmed at all. The other videos were fine, and there is one filmed Peart solo (there should have been three)."
1,awful,"Regarding the Exit Stage Left dvd in this package, be prepared to be disappointed.The audio mix is the worst I've ever heard, mostly due to the remixed drum sounds. Why would anyone in their right mind remix the drums on a classic recording like this? These guys are in the music business, and isn't the sound important to them? Are they deaf?The sound keeps going in and out of sync with the picture. Very distracting.If you don't mind some Japanese subtitles during the voice-overs between songs, your money is better spent on the Japanese version of ESL, at HMV Japan.Rush should be ashamed of themselves to have released this nonsense.Rated at ""1"" because 0 wasn't an option."
3,Good but not great. Get the Passaic show,"This is certainly a good deal of the 3 old videocassettes, but it isn't anything that great. Is nice to have a great sounding CD of the Grace Tour. Really would have been great if they went back to the original tapes (which might not exist) and offered more songs, especially from Montreal show. How bout Camera Eye? Not to rehash all the other reviews, so a couple of things:The 4 extra Best Buy tracks are not extra's at all. They are from the other 2 DVD's (Closer To The Heart is from the ESL Video, not the CD, which has that great version from England with the audience singing the song)As one other reviewer stated, get the Passaic, NJ DVD!!! It's a black and white closed feed with time code stamped all over it. The audio is incredible good stereo, and even though it is only 4 songs (including a full 2112) it does blow away any of the shows in this DVD."
4,Curious about shipment,Just got it. Yea! But only 3 disks. Boo!Missing the p/g dvd.Hopefully it is just my copy. ;-)
5,absolutely fantastic. well worth the money,"I'll make this short and to the point. This release is a MUST for any Rush fan, ESPECIALLY if you own a 5.1 or DTS surround sound system in your home. Each one of these concerts is worth the $30 price tag, but to bundle all three and then throw in a live CD of the Grace Under Pressure is just awesome. I've had Exit...Stage Left on VHS, and to own it on DVD in DTS is very cool."
5,Aweeeeeeesome!,"They don't play concerts on T.V. much anymore, and when they play rush concerts, its always the R30 concert and now the Time machine concert. This is a great way to ""Deviate from the norm""!"
1,Exit....Stage Left - Supremely Dissappointing,"I guess I should have read the reviews first, and rented this from netflix....instead of getting excited over the DVDs and buying it!!!!!!!No one wants to hear anyone talk during the songs!!!!!And everyone wants to see the entire song - not sound clips.Not a good way to sell to fans!!!!!!!!Extremely dissappointing."
2,What a disappointment,"I have only watched Disk 1 so far (Exit Stage Left) and uh, that is not the audio from that concert, that tour, or EVEN that Decade!! I am a huge fan of Rush, and particularly Neil, being a drummer myself, and I can tell those drums on this audio mix are his newer DW drums, NOT his old Tamas or Ludwigs for that matter. What a crock! I have Exit Stage Left on a VCD, which was dubbed from the old VHS, and yeah.....different audio. I would rather see a VINTAGE show (if you call 81' vintage yet) with it's original sound, not repackaged with the audio of their 02' tour or whatever. Amazing...you would think RUSH wouldn't try to pull one over on us....but it may not have been there call anyway. Can't wait to see what's wrong with Disk 2 and 3."
3,"Good sound, video...","Not really disappointed with Rush Replay just wish they had put some more money in getting the original prints for ESL and sprucing them up a la Led Zepplin's Song Remains The Same. The latter is an acheivement in film restoration - Rush's effort on the other hand leaves something to be desired. I have a Brazilian version of ESL that looks no different than what they put out here which seems to be a direct transfer of the laserdisc or somethin'. I don't think that's a stretch either. The sound is very good with the 5.1 mix etc. Also, GUP while great to see probably would prove the most difficult to improve visually due to the fact it was shot on video (lot of bleeding reds, bloomed whites etc.) Again, SOH seems to be shot on film and could really use some attention. Hey, I love the band and I am glad to own this set but it's really apprarent they're focused more on the next cd release in the studio then this bit of 80s nostalgia."
4,"great sound, crappy video","Well, close, but no pickle. The remixed audio portion of these videos sound fantastic, with the added bonus that the Exit...Stage Left audio portion does not include the ""fixed"" bits that are on the album, and it's a good thing. However, the video transfer/remastering is inexcusably crappy. Color banding and artifacts abound. Granted, the source video was questionable to begin with, especially the Exit...Stage Left footage, but these could have looked much better than they do.That said, the performances are amazingly tight, and it's exciting to have these concerts available again."
5,best of new and old world,"Well it has been finally released. Having the Show of Hands on DVD causes me the same thrill it did when I bought it in laser disk many years ago.As all Rush material, it is superb presented, mastered,and recorded.Either if you haven't seen them in the past, or if you are a fan, this is a must in your colection."
4,Need more quality control.,I have just started watching Exit Stage Left. I'm happy with the sound and look forward to viewing the other discs. My only gripe is I'm on my second package. The first box had some residue on E.S.L. disc so I went to back to Best Buy to exchange. I got home and the second box is way worse. E.S.L. is scratched in several places and G.U.P. has some sort of over spray on the discs. I'll be heading back to the store later this week to exchange. If I'm buying new DVDs I expect them to be of NEW quality.....without scratches and overspray. Whoever did the manufacturing has some very poor quality control and dirty pressing environments. I'll keep exchanging until I get a set in NEW condition.
4,must have!,I had the last edition and used it till it fell apart. Great diagnostic tool and easy to use. A must have for English teachers.
4,Easy way to learn related scriptures,"I wasn't expecting anything new from this book, but for some reason it helped me in solidifying my goals to learn more scripture. Easy to read with good ideas on how to memorize. I did like the method it gave for review and the goal of learning 2 verses a week are very obtainable for most people. For the price it was a great bargain!"
5,great product:,"This book, has helped me to remember scriptures, Easy shopping, Would recommend this book for others. no complaints with this product."
4,Very Good and Age Appropriate,At our home we are all learning Scripture and since we have various ages we needed a few different ways to make this simple. Memorization of Scripture is hard enough but this system works well.
4,"Good camera, but dark photos if lack of light.","I bought this camera in May 2003. I selected it because was cheap, the partnership between Panasonic and the famous Leica sound reliable, and the resolution was enough to print 10x15[cm]photo. All meet expectation.SD card memory (buy minimum 256Mb)and AA battery are good options when you travel in remote areas or for many days. The colors are very natural and the battery charger is good. The menu include option to disable the digital zoom and the compressed color mode. Tks! :)The bad: dark photos if lack of light. Film mode has low resolution and is limited to 15 sec. No case included."
2,The price indicates the quality,"I bought this flash accessory because it was inexpensive yet seemed to have a good reputation. The quality of lumens generated, while admirable at first, has not lasted. I've changed parts on it but have not been able to restore it to its initial quality. I am disappointed."
2,"Good product, but could be better!","I got 4 of these harnesses for a special olympics ski team I coach, and we've gotten them from other places in the past. The harnesses are great, it's the belts that are flimsy - the stitching around the ""D"" rings come apart.3 out of our 4 belts had this happen - if it were just 1 then I may be inclined to think it was a fluke, but 3 out of 4???? That's just shoddy workmanship.We have since started to make our own, you can get most of the supplies at sewing shops and it's a lot less expensive considering the quality!We had to have someone stitch up the 3 that were faulty and once that was done, they are great.Nice product, but should be stitched stronger."
2,Very basic,"The ski tip clamps work well, if a bit tall. the belt and straps are serviceable, but don't have any padding around the waist or additional straps besides the one that goes around the waist. No carrying pouch of any kind provided. Appears to be not more sophisticated than something one could put together at home with a few webbing straps and clips."
4,Love my bangles!!!,"LOVE this bangle.Very pretty.Has weight to it....not hollow.I get alot of compliments!I ordered 2 more.Very quick delivery.One warning though....if the bangle is too big and you need to adjust it,make sure you squeeze it gently.If you do it too hard,you can damage it(like I almost did). =("
1,Hahahaha,"Think about it-guys who spend all day at the gym and wear clothes which only non ironic flower guys or muscled up playas could wear.Did you expect it to be any good? A mutation of Poison but worse. Plenty will buy it but it's soooo, um, homoerotic"
3,Mahatma's own words...,"Interesting to read his own views and observations. Language is arduous and a bit winding, but such seems to be the style back then. Lot's of interesting little tidbits that I had not seen in more refined biographies on him"
4,Good,What was expected - good product for a great price. I expect that it'll wear out after a couple years.
5,it works,"you plug it in, it connects two things together, it works and sounds good... what more can you ask for in a cable"
4,belkin 6 ft,the coaxial cable is good quality my tv only has output for coaxial audio it made the connections that i needed so I am satisfied with this cable.
3,DCA Cable,"This cable fit a particular need when using a Pioneer ""up conversion"" DVD player. The sound reproduction is very good."
5,"Great cable, great sound","Since digital coaxial audio was the best option for my new TV, I scoured Amazon for the best deal. So far this cable has been great. It works well with my sound bar and TV. We couldn't be happier with the crisp sound quality.I definitely recommend this if you need a digital coaxial cable."
3,Does the Job,"What can one say. It's a cable. Either it works or it doesn't. Good price, don't waste your money on more expensive cables. You can not tell tell the difference."
3,Fit alittle loose,"Had trouble getting this cable to work. It was plugged in and nothing happened, then I bumped it and it started working, bump it again and it stopped. Secured the cable to the back of the receiver and now works fine. Fit could be better"
4,Good Retrospective of Solo Weller,"This is a comprehensive and reasonably adequate overview of solo Weller. But at a running time of 55.50, the package could have been bolstered by some of his B-sides, killers like 'Everything Has a Price to Pay' and 'A Year Late'. The inclusion of lyrics won't harm anyone either. And is that a different mix of 'Out of the Sinking' that I'm hearing?"
5,A great compilation!,"In his genre, Paul Weller is a genius. Maybe his work is not constant, as he wrote incredibly beautiful songs and other more boring ones, but when his songs are beautiful, they are REALLY beautiful! So, a compilation of his past solo albums contains only good works, in which we can still hear the sound as it was in the first 70's, a real, good old rock sound. But there's no need to categorize a work of this kind: if you like GOOD music, then you'll like this CD!"
2,Long and Boring like the Winter It Describes,"Some positives: The Ingalls family is a close-knit loving family and the books promote familial love as well as helping and loving others.It gives children a look into a life completely different from their own and a piece of history.If you read my other Little House reviews, you know I'm not a huge fan. I just don't find their plots-or lack there of, very interesting. The Long Winter is my least favorite-I found it as boring and long as the Winter it describes. I am surprised of all the Little House books, this one made the top 100 Children's Novels on Student Library Journal.While this one is a little more heart-wrenching (seeing Pa start to break down, people freezing), there is still lack of plot development and it drags.Many children seem to like these books and find them interesting, though, They are just not my cup of tea."
2,Cherry Jones wrong reader for me (original book awesome),"I just rented the audio book, read by Cherry Jones, and really could not stand listening to it. I'm glad I didn't buy it. I have read the book several times, and it is a great book. As a native Minnesotan, I can verify the authenticity of it's descriptions of winter. However, the Ingalls family were of Norwegian descent and orginally from Minnesota. Despite stereotypes of pioneers from the TV show, the Ingalls would have had Midwestern accents. I really do not want to hear this book read with the flat prairie twang of the far west. Furthermore, Cherry Jones may be a good actress, but her reading is pure literary sing-song, the kind that makes you stop listening to the meaning of the words after about 3 minutes. If you love country western music and the Grand Ole Opry, maybe Cherry Jones is the reader for you. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Book condition wasn't as good as expected,"This book was not in the condition expected, which was labeled as good. After only one night of reading it, a couple of pages fell out. Cover and individual pages were in good shape, but binding clearly was not."
3,"Ok, but not perfect","I know this is a used book, but some of the pages are almost falling out. My daughter and I both plan on reading it for a book club and I hope it stays together long enough for both of us to get through it."
2,The Long Winter,"It stunk. The first 100 pages were unimpotant details like, Almonzo made good pancakes. Who cares? Young children might enjoy this book, but certainly no one over the age of 9."
1,How Boring!!,"This was one of the most BORING books I have ever read!!My teacher made me read this book in class and I almost fell asleep reading!It might have been interesting to live in these days, but it realy isn't interesting to read about them!"
5,Laura Meets Almanzo,"This is the sixth book in the Little House series. The Ingalls family still resides in Kansas but now their biggest challenge is not Mary's future. It is winter and the worst snow storm has hit. School has not been in session and trains are not running.Food has run out and there is no coal to heat homes. What is a town to do besides grow more frustrated with each passing day? Enter a brave young man and his brother. They must risk their own safety in order to provide food for the town. It seems winter will never end but eventually it does and life goes on as it should. The folks of De Smet will forever be grateful, especially Laura and her family. What she doesn't know is that the young man who saved the town will one day become her husband."
4,Check this out!,"This book is a winner! It has so much adventure you have to read it!!It will bring shivers down your spine! Not to to mention a smile on your face when you finish it!! Come on, you have to buy this exciting book! When you read it your heart will be touched how the Ingalls family stuck together! This book creates suspense and joy to it's readers. If you like Laura Ingalls Wilders other books you will love this one!"
5,Excellent reading,My daughter is addicted to the book and cannot put it down. she writes - The Ingalls face the hard winter of 1880-1881 in the little townhouse. They do so much hard work and Carrie has grown from little baby to young 10 year old. Read more to discover the exciting storyline.
5,The Long Winter (Little House),"Love these books, all of them. My 3-year-old grandson loves for me to read them to him. Sometimes I just pick them up and read them myself because they are so heart warming."
5,Great book!,"The Long Winter is the 6th book in the original Little House Series.Life is going good for the Ingalls family out West in the Dakota Territory until a hard winter hits. There's blizzards every few days and the trains are snowed in...with all the food inside them.As people in the town grow more and more hungry, Almanzo Wilder and Cap Garland decide to see if an old rumor is true and set out on a mission in search of wheat.To stay warm when there is no wood or lumber to burn, the family has to twist hay into hard sticks and burn that instead.The fact that people survived when there was little resources to draw from simply intrigued me. It made me appreciate the things that I would take for granted everyday. A good read for any person."
1,cuisinart coffee,the thermal caraf is wonderful the maker is hard to read and quit working sent back twice still have problums
2,cuisinart programmable automatic brew and thermal coffeemaker,The item was not accepted and returned. My refund was within 7days.
3,Trying this pot one more time,"We previously purchased two of these for our cabin (lots of coffee drinkers). They were refurbished models and neither lasted more than 6 months. We are trying a brand new one to see if that makes a difference. We love the size, the color, the thermal pots so we are really hoping buying a brand new one will work better for us. This will be the model's last chance."
1,Good Coffee - Poor Design,"This makes excellent coffee. The carafe works exactly as advertised. Unfortunately poor engineering negates the positives. The carafe lid is hard to seat correctly. Having unsealed electronics below the carafe is simply bad design. Any overflow can and will seep into the display and controls. Then, kaput! You are left with worthless pieces of plastic."
1,I had to return it,"My husband was not able to make coffee in this coffee maker. He gets up first and likes lots of strong coffee in the mornings. Every time (!) he made coffee in this maker it would over flow all over the kitchen and get coffee grounds in everything.It is difficult to clean up after this happens as the basket holder does not detatch from the coffee maker and it is hard to get all the overflowed grounds out of it. Then the carafe has to be taken apart. It is hard to get the grounds out of the lid where the coffee is suposed to flow.We had it two weeks, wasted tons of coffee, had lots of arguements and returned it for a different coffee maker, which is working fine."
5,Best Machine I Have Ever Owned,"I have been looking at this machine for some time now and after reading everyones reviews I decided to try it. I absolutely love this machine. Some of the reviews stated that they had problems with the lid not lining up right,but so far I have not had this problem. It is a beautiful machine and it keeps my coffee hot for hours. My most favorite part is no more scorched coffee, it always tasts fresh. I would highly recommend this machine."
3,I feel a bit cheated.,"The Amazon ad promised an in-box coupon for a free coffee grinder, which justified the price for us. The coupon was not in the box, and I'm not thrilled with the inconvenience of attempting to sort this out. The unit itself is so-so. The thermal pot is terrific, and the reason we purchased. However, the basket that holds the grounds does not lock securely in place and the brewing unit is somewhat flimsy. The digital panel is not backlit, so nearly impossible to read - and the programmed brewing icon is so tiny I can barely see it even with bifocals. Having said all that, once you get the basket to stay shut and turn it on, it makes a good cup of coffee."
4,Love it but wife hates the BEEP!,"I measured carefully below my kitchen cabinet and have about 1/8"" clearance, so the height worked great for me.I love the coffee this makes and the aroma is not enough to drive my wife crazy (she's not a coffee drinker).The carafe just takes an extra half second to make sure it's lined up. No big deal.The thing that drives us nuts is the ""coffee's done"" beep. It's loud, and it wakes up my family when I make coffee early in the morning. I've searched the manual and the internet for a way to turn this off.I'd buy it again but I would purchase the soundproof booth option if they had one. Or I'd unwire the beeper."
3,5 stars new - 3 stars now,"I feel vindicated. Thought it was something I did. Had the coffeemaker less than 2 months and the ""pause and pour"" quit pausing. Since the coffee was so great, I decided to ignore it and just wait until the end of the brewing cycle - you know - when the ""smoke alarm sound"" goes off. Two days ago, I went for a cup of coffee after the ""beep"" and I too had coffee on the counter and floor. I sent it back for a replacement. Love the coffee and thermique so much, I'm willing to give it another try. By the way, if you turn the lid counter-clockwise a couple of times it will seat properly to turn clockwise and seal the thermique. Never had a problem there. I'm hoping for a better experience the 2nd time around. I know, I know - but I love the ""all day"" fresh, hot coffee and programmable ability for rush mornings."
5,Love it!,I love it. I think the coffe tastes better and it keeps hot for a longer time without getting bitter.I make a larger pot of coffee now and it is still warm in the afternoon. If need be a 30 sec zap in the micro brings it back.
3,Decent Coffeemaker with Good Points and One Issue,"Generally happy with the unit; have used it now for over a month.Good points: 12-cup capacity, brews fast, looks good, thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for some hours and the spout is the best by far of any coffeemaker I've ever had.Downside: Poorly designed snap latch for the grounds basket. If it pops open a bit while brewing, the coffee will overflow. After first week of use I returned the unit, fortunately the replacement works better. While the fit doesn't seem too secure it hasn't popped out in a month of use so I'll keep it.Great service from Amazon on the no-charge return, wow."
3,Metal Cutting Blade,"Works well on thicker steel items. It is very easy to knock the carbide tips off of the teeth when you first start cutting the edge of a piece of stock. The blade will last longer if you can hold the blade guard open, turn the saw on, and lower the blade slowly onto the piece you are cutting, away from the edge. Of course, it is DANGEROUS to hold the blade guard open, so I'm NOT RECOMMENDING this procedure. If you start cutting a thin piece of steel from the edge, the blade will bounce off the edge and you'll damage the blade. Works well on 1/4"" bar stock, leaves a very smooth cut and doesn't create a lot of heat. Average rating is based on high price and short life."
3,Interesting Book,"As a reader it was really interesting to read the book. As a Muslim there is only one contradiction which makes me doubt the Bahai Faith. Prophet Muhammad is a great prophet for both the Bahais and Muslims. Prophet Muhammads words are upholded by the Bahai as well. Prophet Muhammad said two things. Jesus is a Prophet like Moses, and there shall be no other Prophet after Muhammad. No the other Prophet. Only Jesus will return. The book is written nicely and really shows the Bahai faith in a modest manner. However I bear witness that there is no other god but Allah, and Muhammad is his last messenger."
5,A visually striking celebration of jazz,"""Bring on That Beat,"" by Rachel Isadora, is a book that celebrates jazz through poetry and illustrations. The book jacket notes that it takes place in Harlem in the 1930s.The illustrations are primarily in black-and-white, with a charcoal-like look. Superimposed on these illustrations are playfully surreal multicolored accents. The result is quite striking; the book has a visual style that bursts with fun and energy.The illustrations capture many marvelous images: children dancing, a band jamming on a rooftop, a brilliantly lit-up city skyline, a trumpeter lit by streetlight. Duke Ellington is celebrated in the book's poetry: ""Duke Ellington-- / King o' the sun. / Cool as a cat, / He's where it's at."" ""Bring On"" is an excellent celebration of American culture."
1,not very good,this product is discountined for 5 years i have one but purchased a year ago and the teflon is peeling off and no one can do anything because they dont make them anymore so how can amazon be selling them.?????
4,great Quesadilla's if you can find the sweet spots,"This is the second of these we have bought. Wife dropped the first one and broke the latch - a very important piece. Only two drawbacks we have found is that once the bottom sheet is placed on the cooker, it is very hard to figure out exactly where to put the stuffing. Edges are not a good place and it is hard to find the dips in the 6 triangles. Also takes a while to heat up the first time, but after that it is a rapid turn around. Remember to keep the drip pan under the spout. Cleans up easy and stores vertical so very little cupboard space. This new one has a slightly looser latch, so even with a bit of extra stuffing, the system closes to seal the Quesadillas. I recommend this unit highly. Was quite a bit cheaper on Amazon than at 3 local stores (and no I don't work for them ((:-)> ) and I got it during a free shipping gig."
5,Great little item,This is a great piece to have in your kitchen if their are any children or teens around. Quesadilla's are yummy and fast to make. This maker heats up quickly and makes the Quesadilla in about 4 minutes. for cleanup I just wet 2 paper towels and then put them between the plates for about 30 seconds and then wipe.
3,GREAT,This is an excellent product. So many different variations can be made with it. It's just messy to clean up.
5,Great product!,We love the quesadilla maker. It is very quick and has been a big hit with friends and family. We set up a make-your-own quesadilla bar.
4,Salton Qm2R Santa Fe 900-Watt Quesadilla Maker,"My sister recomended this product to me,she & her son definitely love their's..Im still experimenting w/this product. I like the simplicity of operation, & clean up for sure. I would like to have more ""guts"" per say inside the quesidilla when completed though. Maybe it's just my technique not completely honed? I had lots of cheese coming out onto the rim in the baking process so I thought I was over filling? Maybe I just need to keep trying new recipes & techniques..??? Wish me luck. Anyway it certainly is nice to have the availability to make one at home anytime I want at about less then a third of what they charge in a restaurant too... So I guess it's a win-win on most front's.."
2,Results not what expected,I have found that this seals a lot of air between the torillas and the tortillas don't turn out as moist as I prefer. My panini press does a better job.
2,Why?,"If you have a small kitchen, do yourself a favor and make your quesadillas on the stovetop. The product is functional, but it's just another gadget to collect dust in our pantry."
1,quesadilla maker,This appliance is impossible to keep clean because the plates are not removable. After a while food debris began to harden and becomes difficult to remove from the grill plates. It also drips at the back of the appliance which does not have a drip tray causing oil and other debris gets all over the coil wires. After 2 years the tephlon on the plates began to really flake and stick to my quesadillas! I bought the Cruisinart Griddler to replace this product. It makes quesadillas among MANY other things and clean up is a breeze because the plates are removable and the drip tray catches all spill over.
5,Love it!,I waited for this product. I couldn't buy it anywhere else. It was worth the wait! I love it.
3,"Neat, but not the best designed","After only a handful of uses, I broke my quesadilla maker. The rubberized portion where you press the lid shut is not very well reinforced. Additionally, it gets very hot, so I only use my thumb to close the lid. The pan is kinda shallow, so its hard to put enough toppings in. These combined are why my quesadilla maker now has a thumb sized hole where you shut the lid. Apparently, instead of glueing a piece of plastic and rubber to a metal lid, the makers actually had a hole in the metal where the ruber patch covers. SO if you press too hard, you snap the plastic. Granted, I was overstuffing the quesadilla maker, but It still baffles me why you would have only plastic where your user would be pushing the hardest."
4,"Delicious, messy, easy","You won't regret buying this Salton Quesadilla Maker. It makes quesadillas in perfect, easily cut little pockets which are great for parties or entertaining your hungry and drunken friends. The quesadillas taste clean and oil free, much different from your average quesadilla from a frying pan cooked in oil. You'll find yourself using this machine when you prefer one type of quesadilla, and your frying pan when you prefer the greaser more organic variety.The one use I find this particularly useful for is when I'm hung over, wake up dehydrated in the night and need something to eat to balance my stomach. Quesadillas cook in a matter of minutes - just throw a little cheese, spinach, tomatoes and meat in them and you're back to a good night's sleep without that gross hungry-sick feeling. Seriously, if you're not an alcoholic the quesadillas are still delicious, but if you are look no further - you'll find it to be a necessity.<3 Jim!"
3,Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker - OK,"My friend owns a similar one so I thought I would purchase this brand for myself. I am not that impressed with it so far. I used the larger tortilla's and added mixed egg and bacon. I followed directions and the egg was still runny inside. I also tried just cheese in the tortillas and the edges of the tortilla were a bit overcooked and dry. I have tried different cooking times and ingredients and still have yet to make a great quesadilla! Not very impressed with how little ingredients you can add either - or it will run out the sides - or get not get fully cooked. Clean up is also not that easy....lots of wiping to do depending on what ingredients were added.It stores nicely, thats about it."
5,Quick easy supper,"I borrowed a friends quesadilla maker to try it out. Easy and tasty! I ordered the exact same one the next day. Comes with a cookbook too. So easy, I love it! I buy a cooked rotisserie chicken and de-bone it. Chicken cheese quesadillas are the best. Dip them in homemade guacamole or salsa, even better! Great to send with my hubby for lunches. Most used appliance I have, besides the coffee maker. I will probably give one as a gift to my son and DIL."
2,"OKAY,I GUESS.","IT COOKS THEM OAKY I GUESS, BUT JUST WAS NOT IMPRESSED. THEY JUST DIDNT TURN OUT LIKE I WAS EXPECTING."
2,Chipped Already!,"I am so disappointed! I was thrilled to get this item after good reviews and going through 2 other quesadilla makers. I have used it twice. As I was wiping it down last night with a damp paper towel, part of the black coating scraped off. So now I know that if any ingredients leak out, they will stick that that place. Also I know the chip will grow. I am not happy about the poor quality of this product!"
2,Cheap latch broke really easily,"Made great quesadillas till latch broke. There's a latch that helps clamp the top part of this clamshell device to the bottom part. It is made out of cheap plastic. It broke very easily within the first 3 times I used the device. Now, the only way to clamp the top part to the bottom part is to use a clamp I bought from the hardware store. Without this clamp, the quesadillas will not cook properly. Note: this is the exact same device as the Bella Cucina 13506 Quesadilla Maker. It's just sold by somebody else!"
3,Fair Quesadilla maker,"This does a decent job of making quesadillas and the clean up is easy but my main concern is the small amount of ""stuff"" that you can pack into the quesadilla. If you use more than a 1/4 cup of cheese is runs out and if you use other ""stuff"" the maker will not close."
5,worth every penny!!,"i love this product! my kids like quesadillas and i thought i would give this a try. it makes great quesadillas and i use it a couple of times a week for dinner or just a snack for the kids. the unit takes only minutes to heat up. i have used the small and large tortillas. with the small tortillas, sometimes a little cheese oozes out, but the excess cheese wipes up easily. i prefer the small size tortilla because the large size is a very large protion. i have even made chicken quesadillas, and it works great will filling in it besides cheese (though i do after a minute or two rotate the shell for more even heating when i stuff the quesadilla with more than just cheese) definitely worth the money and would buy again!!!"
2,Fillings too sparse for tortilla size,"Look at the product photo closely and you'll see how much of the tortillas' margins are taken up in sealing the outer edges. That leaves very little room for fillings. The end result is too much tortilla and not enough filling, for my taste. On the plus side, it cooks nicely and cleans up easily."
3,Hot spots in Quesadilla Maker,"I recently ordered this at a great price and, despite the imperfection in it, it is worth having at that price. However, I was disappointed--and still am--that there is a persistent hot spot in the top half which causes the top of about 2-3 tortilla slices to brown unevenly and have a few dark, toasty spots. I always follow the directions faithfully (no more than 5 minutes cooking, oil it first, etc.), and this is clearly a true hot spot and not due to my own making. This leads me to question whether or not the great sale price was on a ""second?"""
3,Lid wouldn't stay shut,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and when she went to use it, the lid would not stay shut, so she is sending it back."
2,Quesadilla makers by Salton,Ordered 5 quesadilla makers by Salton for X-mas presents and 4 out of 5 of them were damaged. I have returned 4 of them and figure that they were misproperly packaged and assume they were damaged during shipping. Had to pay quite a bit of money to return them and am under the understanding that you are refunding my postage. Will not reorder for fear this could happen again.
1,Junk,"What a peice of junk. Cannot hold any contents at all. The cheese gets all over, making for an impossible clean up. I threw it out rather then try to scrub the peice of junk."
1,Piece of Junk,"I cannot understand why people like this unit as I found this to be a piece of junk, along with a waste of money and electricity. This unit does not do a good job of sealing the quesadillas. I found its use no different than preparing the quesadilla on a regular pan. I returned this back immediately."
4,love it,"This product is awesome,only problem is I am having a hard time finding large enough tortillas. You definately have to have the really big ones otherwise all your filling comes out."
4,Use It Every Day,Good product for the price. I have used it tons of time. I do feel like the non stick could start peeling of the non stick plates that are attached. I guess that may start h appening if you use it every day!
3,Heat pad cracks through lid when depressed,"There is a weak spot under the oval heat pad. When snapping the lid shut, my finger went through it & cracked the thin plastic material under the pad. Also the red latch comes off its hinges frequently when snapping shut. It can be reattached, but it is a real inconvenience while cooking."
2,Hard to Clean!,"While we love the crispy, nicely-sealed edges that this quesadilla maker creates, it is super hard to clean! Cheese always oozes down into the hinges, even though we really try not to over-fill. The non-stick coating lasted about 6 months (I don't think anyone used a metal spatula on it), and now I am chiseling off the cheese that gets out of the edges and cooks hard onto the grill. The taste of the quesadillas is great, but I want removable plates and something to block spillage from getting back into the hinges!"
5,Quesadilla heaven!!,I love this little appliance. I used to make quesadilla's for my kids by putting them in our toaster over. This little thing takes minutes to heat up and you just wait another few minutes until you can smell it and then check to see if the tortilla's are lightly browned. Ta da! Done. It browns on both sides and seals the edges and seals in each pie shape piece which you can then just use a pizza cutter to separate each slice.
2,"Pretty, but doesn't hold enough filling","This quesadilla maker makes a very colorful addition to the kitchen counter--but that's about it. It doesn't allow you to put in enough filling to make it worth the trouble! You can barely taste the thin filling layer of chicken, cheese, or whatever--mostly you just taste tortilla. Too bad, because it is a great idea, it just needs to be redesigned."
1,Piece of crap!,It wasnt easy to clean this up. It sticks down to the edges like Cheese melts makes a mess have to get a knife to clean down the edges its a big royal pain in the butt. Theres a sucker born every minute. I was that sucker. :(
4,"Quesadilla Maker, worth every penny","We had the same item, but it was dropped by my daughter and the lid broke off. I was unable to find a replacement in any store. Found it on Amazon and the price was very reasonable. The only downside of this item is, if you drop it on the floor, good chance it won't survive."
5,Excellent Book,"This is one of the best books worldwidely in the field of Physical Therapy.It covers nearly all the areas of a PT interest:musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,pulmonary,geriatric,neurological, genitourinary,obstetric,wound healing, craniomandibular,oncological physiotherapy and much more.Indispensable for every new therapist but also a good one for experts althouth hasn't so many details as they would love,but i think it's a really interesting book that set high standards in Physiotherapy.After 22 skilled years in therapy, i recommend it for all my colleagues."
4,still a great saw,"I don't need to say how great this saw is. Other reviewers have covered that.As another reviewer noted, though, the saw is out of square. Mine was out by 1/32"". The removal of a couple screws and some shims corrected the problem and now it runs true. For a tool of this caliber, you shouldn't have to service it right out of the box. I'd have given it 3.5 stars for that."
5,Mikko,Great machine I'm a big Bosch fan. Guard design works very well on angle and bevel cuts . Switch operates easily. After alot of handling and comparing of 4 similar saws Im glad I picked the Bosch. I found this saw for $160.00 including a nice 25 ft cord at a hardware store . I will keep Skil Mag for low cuts on rebar and masonary Its been a fine saw just heavier and has more kick at start up.
2,"Tried Two, Both handles not properly attached","I was pretty excited about getting this saw based on the other reviews. However when I received it, the handle had some wiggle that I find unacceptable in a $180 product. It is like they didn't machine the holes for the attachment screws deep enough. I returned the first one for a replacement and the second one came the same way. I think I am going to go with the Milwaukee. Also, as an FYI this product is made in China. I know a lot of things are made over there but I didn't really expect this from Bosch."
3,"It's nice and shiny, but...","Love the saw, but I just can't see spending an extra $30-$40 for a chromed guard that's going to do nothing but blind you when you use it in the sun.In defense of the bosch engineers who have brought us so many great tools, I'm quite sure this one was the brainchild of their marketing department.Having to squint through the glare of the sun while following a line isn't a huge problem, but it's still one I'm not willing to pay an $40 extra to have.Thanks anyways.Maybe they should have gone with some special edition blinking led's or maybe have it play the bosch theme song when you open the box. That would have been equally useless as the chrome, but at least it wouldn't have impacted the useability of a perfectly good saw.I do highly recommend the non-special edition version, but this one, put the extra $40 towards a new blade."
2,BEWARE - Out of Square,"I am a professional carpenter and I use this tool every day. It is considerably lighter than the standard Skil wormdrive and the deck is substantially more durable than the Skil MAG 777. A great saw with one major exception. I have seen several that come out of the box with the outside edge of the deck out of parallel to the blade. This problem makes it impossible to use a BCI cut guide or to simply hold the edge of the saw to a speed square for quick, precision cuts. If you buy one, take your framing square to the store with you and make sure that the blade and the edge of the deck are on the same plane. My depth adjustment also binds but I have experienced the same problem with almost every Skil wormdrive I have used. Its annoying but doesn't affect the functionality of the saw"
5,Good tunes!,"Great catchy alt/pop tunes. This album is by far one of the more refreshing releases of 2002. Sun is such a strong single, it really should get way more radio play. If you like fun, catchy music, check out this CD."
5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS!,"I first purchased this on cassette tape not knowing much about the band but the tape ended up on super heavy rotation in my Walkman. Luckily I was smart enough to get it on CD for a good price when it became available and all I can say is that this disc remains a gem.The band rocks, the songs are excellent and Sandi Saraya has a killer voice. Some of today's wannabe female rockers can take learn a few things from Sandi. For me she's flawless. From the beautiful ballad 'St' Christopher's Medal' to the hard-chargin' 'Runnin Out Of Time', she delivers the goods! Kudos to the band for their top notch playing. Just a brilliant CD. Miss you Sandi!www.electriceyes.us"
3,One Hit Wonder Band,"Like many others here, I heard ""Love Has Taken Its Toll"" on the radio and liked it enough to buy the cassette tape back in 1989. It is a great song with great guitar work. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is pretty forgettable and hasn't held up very well over time.I listened to the whole album again last night after many years of neglect and only ""Drop The Bomb"" comes close to the heights of ""Love Has Taken Its Toll."" While the female vocalist reminds you of Heart a little bit, she just doesn't have enough range to keep you interested for very long. The lyrics also are fairly lame but you come to expect that from most rock groups with writers in their 20's!"
3,Their best CD ever!,"This is good old fashion hair metal at its best. They want sex, drugs and rock n roll and hold no punches about it!! Good guitar work and a nice clean sound. If your in it for the one or two big hits try the ""Best of.."" CD, but if you want Warrant the way they were ment to be listened to buy this CD!!"
2,can't rate item fairly due to not even being able to listen to example of he music included,"Warrant was quite popular when I was in high school - the '80's....there were several songs I really liked. I kind of feel like I am walking in the dark with this review;.....I am only going by ""word of mouth"".Laters.....Chancy"
1,5 Stars?,Is there a band worse than Kix? Yes there is indeed and their name is Warrant. Ever heard of iron maiden? and Im not talking about the band I'm talking about the torture device.....it may come in handy when listening to Warrant CDs....
4,A great voice - RIP Jane Lane - This CD is one to buy,"This CD has 5+ mega 80's hairband hits. Songs like ""I saw Red, Blind Faith, Uncle Toms Cabin,Cherry Pie, Mr. Rainmaker, etc. are just some of the hits that make this a classic. RIP Jane Lane - your voice will be missed."
4,"20 years later, a big surprise!","Honestly, the last couple of weeks were the first time I'd heard the entire album in about 20 years. After Jani Lane (singer) passed away, I kept hearing about what a great writer he was, so I dusted off my old CD version of this and took a listen with new ears, not of a high school girl, but as a woman with more developed tastes. Don't get me wrong, this isn't something I'd take with me on a desert island, but as far as hair metal goes, it's pretty good! If you know Cherry Pie or Uncle Tom's Cabin, the rest of the CD is more of the same. Big drums, big guitars, and great vocals.4-stars for hair metal. 3-stars for general music."
4,Excellent compilation....but where is the extra?,"Excellent idea, one of the best hair metal band of the 80's and its best 2 albums, really good songs to remember real good times.Both Cd are a must for any music collector from rock circa of latest of the 80's. Here my only complain is that with 2 cds space that holds 160 minutes, easily could be added the remastered tracks from Dog eat Dog, the acoustics versions that came on the singles (I saw red, Blind faith, The bitter pill and B-sides. So the value-add is not much and not atractive to buy again -If you already got the 2 CDs when they were released in 2005), PLEASE Sony/Legacy records think a little bit more to give an interesting and attractive touch to this kind of re-re-release (ADD songs from CD out of print, the acoustics, B-sides). You want to sell as a new product, do it different! Wake up!"
1,This was a gift,"This was a gift for my wife. I do not like this band at all. They call this metal? Yeah, I guess it's metal. It's not REAL heavy metal like Iron Maiden, Slayer, Black Sabbath, Venom, and Ronnie James Dio. Everyone is into different stuff. I like REAL heavy metal so I don't like this. I guess if you like Bon Jovi, Ratt, Mr. Big, Journey, and Cinderella you will probably enjoy Warrant."
3,Tastes So Good?!,"I have mixed emotions about this disc. Obviously, Warrant as a band is hard to take seriously, but this disc seems to inspire good times. Everybody seemed to be getting laid when this was out. On the one hand, ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", ""I Saw Red"" & ""Mr. Rainmaker"" are really good songs (which is what gets this 3 stars) but the other tracks like ""Cherry Pie"" & ""Love In Stereo"" fall into that 'lets write yet another song about chicks' category and makes them extremely ridiculous & disposible."
5,Magnificent Duo Recording!,"This is an absolutely beautiful recital from these two seasoned professionals. The Brazilian repertoire brings out Rich Perry's lyrical side and Danko's fine playing is right there with him every step of the way. Unfortunately, this CD, like the two men who made it, will likely never be heard by more than a handful of listeners. Check this music out - you won't regret it."
2,"Sadly, a dull entry for a great person","I am a big fan of Beethoven and classical music in general. One of my favorite films is ""Immortal Beloved"". I have come across some good biographies, too. I was thrilled when I read about a new fictionalized biography of the composer--I knew I had to check it out. There were some interesting and familiar aspects to it, but overall the writing was rather flat. It was dull and repetitive, and there was no sense that the author really tried to perk up his prose. Yes, it is based on Beethoven's life (hence the interesting aspect) but the author tends to drift into the more boring realm. Plus, he adds some unnecessarily explicit sex scenes, of the type that should certainly warrant a warning label on the cover."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"Incredibly bad 1950's fantasy/horror movie about an abominable snowman on the loose in Los Angeles. Everything about this one--writing, acting, production values--is strictly grade Z. It is beyond belief that a major studio like Paramount was associated in any way with this thing. What were they thinking of? Ed Wood would have been ashamed to have his name associated with it."
1,The Slow Creature...,"To call this movie ""boring"" would be like calling Sadam Hussein ""cranky"". Words pale in the face of such horror! THE SNOW CREATURE is a sub-zero budget ""monster"" movie with a tall guy in fuzzy clothes standing in for the monster. He's supposed to be a yeti / bigfoot / abominable snowman, but is more like a wookie / teddy-man in need of a good long bath. Yes, he kills someone (in a boring way), which leads a group into the mountains to track him down. We get to see the creature dance back and forth, in and out of the shadows, over and over, until our heads want to spin off! Wilder used the same shot of the beast coming at us some 13-14 times! Somehow, the creature ends up back in LA (I fell asleep during it's transport), escapes, and roams around aimlessly. My advice? Stay away! For God's sake, stay away..."
2,That was only 69 minutes????!!!!!,"Wow. It seemed like three hours. The beginning was nearly interesting but it turned into a real snorefest. One of these reviews said the movie was so bad it was good. No. It's so bad, it's just awful."
2,It's WORTHLESS until you upgrade,"I'm the ISP for an entire condo complex. I need military-tight security and solid professional gear that can take heavy traffic. I bought Netgear because it had a long warranty, a great price and the dual WAN ports sounded great for a mission critical environment. With 4 gigabit LAN ports I was ready for heavy traffic.Before installing it on site, I hooked it up at home and got NOTHING! It'll tell you you've got a valid IP and DNS on your WAN but this brick wouldn't going anywhere on the 'net!I fought with it for two hours until I went back to my old router, downloaded firmware 1.33 and applied it. Suddenly everything worked. The box finally did what I bought it for!I'm grateful the latest firmware straighten everything out but how could they have let anything so AWFUL get out the door in the first place? They should stick a warning label right on the box: Load firmware 1.33 FIRST!"
1,Abandon and dump this product,We've had this unit for two years now and gone through the numerous software patches. It was an expensive unit to start with but has the features required.It has proven to be a long term dog and drain on the network. We have a broadband download pipe of 100Mbps in Singapore and with a direct modem connection we achieve regular speeds of 77-80mbps.When same computer is routed through the FVS124G the internal software of the device kills capacity to a slow 6mpbs which is just unacceptable.We've tried Netgear support and no luck there so recommendation to other users is save the hassle and buy an appropriate other router.RegardsMatthew Holdenwww.podasia.netSingapore
1,Firmware not up to snuff,"I purchased this router as an upgrade to a Linksys RV042 because I needed the QoS feature for VoIP.Unfortunately it seems that there are significant problems with the firmware which cause the router to lockup for unknown reasons in a variety of configurations.There is a long thread on this issue in the public Netgear support forums, and while Netgear is aware of the issue there seems to be no ETA for a fix. As of the time of this writing, the latest firmware is 1.1.21 (beta) and it does not fix this issue.I am hoping that Netgear can clear this problem up. When the router was up and running it seemed to work just fine. If you don't need QoS, I'd recommend the Linksys RV042. If you do need QoS, hold off on this one until the firmware issues have been fixed. Make sure to check out the Netgear support forums first. If you can't wait, have a look at the Xincom Dual-Wan routers.. the DPG503 is the most similar in features."
1,This product is not worth the hassle,"As a reseller of Netgear products I thought I would try this out, its definitely NOT worth the money, I purchased this product back in August and have had various problems with it ever since I got it. They finally have the firmware up to par but now I'm having issues with it saving the static IP addressing I use. Forget about tech support they are worthless it takes 3 to 4 days or longer in some cases to get a response. I do not recommend this product, it seems that NETGEAR was in too big a hurry to get this product out on the market and really didn't do a good job of testing it. Buyer beware!!!! Spend a few extra bucks and get something better like 3com."
1,DO NOT BUY FVS-124G ROUTER YET,"As of September 16, 2005, Users are experiencing great difficulty keeping this router up and running. No word from Netgear on when firmware fix will be forthcoming but problem appears to be present since at least August 3, 2005. Google ""netgear fvs124G hangup"" for NETGEAR user forum discussing problems. If you buy dual-DSL for extra reliability, you will be extra disappointed with firmware lockups. I was."
1,FVS124G Router does not work,The FVS124G router has multiple problems and does not work well. It does not meet many of its advertised features and performance and crashes often. The situation has been known by Netgear for over six months with no solution. Negear is unresponsive in corporate customer support for this problem and it is unlikely to be resolved. I had to purchase a different similar router from a differnent company. Netgear is unresponsive to provide refunds for this defective product.
1,Think carefully before purchasing this product - NETGEAR has stated it is End Of Life,"Purchased this recently and wanted support for it not updating to daylight savings time correctly. Was told by support that the product is End of Life and limited support.""Hello my name is Herbert and the daylight saving time was changed last year is when it went into affect. Starting one month early. Unfortunately the FVG124G is now End Of Life and no new firmware updates will be made to the product. In fact the FVG124G has limited support available.Regards,Herbert 5038NETGEAR PROSAFE SUPPORT"""
1,Terrible Product,"I bought 4 of them based on the feature set and didn't read any reviews - shame on me! Newest firmware 1.30 corrects some problems, but if you enable any advanced feature (QOS, keyword blocking, load balancing), router will soon be locked up and require a reboot. Run away from this dog."
2,Dual WAN/VPN Problems,"The Firewall seems to perform well when only a single WAN port is used. However, when 2 WANs are used in Load-Balancing mode with proper protocol bindings, the VPN sporadically quits. This usually requires a factory reset to remedy."
2,Barely works,"If all you want are two Internet connections then this will work fine, even in ""load balancing"" mode where both connections are used at the same time, or dedicated mode, when one connection is not used unless the first one fails. However, if you need to use any protocol binding (assigning a computer or a program or a protocol like SMTP to go out one specific connection), it simply doesn't work. Research it on the Netgear forums. It's mind boggling how this product got in the market place as Netgear's ""ProSafe"" line.Furthermore, as another user has already reported, as of mid-2009, if MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger try to connect to the internet, this router locks up (that was GREAT fun to figure out...especially since I don't use either program). I won't say this experience has ruined my Netgear impression, but it's definitely a blemish because this product has been abandoned after a very short life span. Last firmware is 1.1.48 and it doesn't fix the protocol binding issue."
4,Very Pleased,"This is one great LCD. Excellent quality and performance. I have it sitting next to a 19"" sony hd400 crt and it""s hard to see a difference in picture sharpness. I run a gainward g4 ti4600 and have the twinview setup so I can really compare the performance. The only drawback is the ""ghosting"" that occures in High fps games. In flight sims, you notice it alot more. In first person shooters like Americas Army, it's only noticable when panning and then not very bad. This is not untypical of LCD's. However with this monitors 25ms response time, it is one of the best. I did contact viewsonic about the ghosting and was pleasently suprised by their quick and proffesional response. I would not hesitate to recommend this monitor."
3,Alright so far,"I like this 19"" monitor a lot better than my previous 18"" Phillips. Mainly, as a Spinal Tap fan would say, because it's 1"" bigger.Seriously, besides being 19"" (bigger than 18""), it delivers a bright, crisp, perfect picture. Installation took 10 minutes or less, consisting mainly in plugging a couple of cables at the back of the monitor and then connecting the other ends to the computer and the power outlet. And that was it. Life's been great ever since."
3,Poor resolution,"Like most other 19 inch LCD monitors, this one only supports 1280x1024 resolution. This really should be much higher. My Dell notebook has a 14 inch screen with an incredible 1600x1200. Text looks like text. Italics look like italics. We should expect more from monitor manufacturers."
5,Wow...,"...I did check the reviews here first and have to agree. Setup was a few minutes and the display looks stunning with no bad pixels that I could see. Colors are rich and saturated with excellent blacks and everything is so sharp. I thought my Sony laptop LCD was da bomb, not it looks dowdy compared to this great product. Have not tried the speakers and may not. I also have not gotten into the controls, however I don't think I need to adjust anything at all. Great product, I am a Viewsonic believer now."
3,never got the point...,"First half of the book I was pretty much bored and confused over the character situation - who was who and the relationships involved. The second half was trying to un-confuse me, but I don't know if it succeed in doing so or not. This would not be top-notch Anderson, unlike his fabulous book Tau Zero. I can't draw any comparisons, as the books are so different and seemingly write by different mindsets of the same author. I never got the point of Harvest the Fire. Additionally, I really hated the artwork. I was no fan of the Golden Age style prints in the book, which made up for about 10% of the entire thickness - simply adding pages to an already sparse book."
1,Picture is misleading,This is only one pack of flints. These are .70 cents at any gas station. Don't be fooled by the picture.
2,misleading description,"photo leads one to think they would be receiving multiple packs of flints for a great price. Text indicates 6 flints per dispenser (which is, basically, true), but I'll never order from these people again. My fault too: caveat emptor."
5,greart price,The flints where nice and big with 6 flints in the pack I will be reorder many timers again thanks alot
1,Misleading title and picture!!,Caveat emptor on this item here. I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this thinking that it was for a pack of 6 flints per card with 6 cards in total. It is ONLY 1 CARD with 6 flints in the dispencer!! Look elsewhere as you will find prices starting from $1.50 e.g. on ebay.STAY AWAY!!Hopefully someone reads this before ordering unlike me.
1,ignore picture!,BOGUS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE received only 1 container of 6 flints. not box shown. i would rate zero stars
1,False advertising,"The product description plainly states 2 pans. The picture shows 2 pans. I received only one pan. I emailed them about the problem. They want me to send the cake pan back and they will send it out again. What? Why can't they send me another pan so that I will have 2 pans like the description states. There is too much trouble to go to for a cake pan. It says 2 pans, I got 1 pan."
2,"Acceptable quality for ""now and then"" use","First of all, Amazon is lying when they say this pan is a set. It is only one pan. Secondly, they claim this is high quality, but it is rather thin and the company apparently used cheap glue to stick the label on the inside of the pan. I cannot wash out the glue, so be prepared to line this pan with parchment or wax paper if you use it!!!Amazon apologized and sent me another when I complained, but claimed to be sending me a whole new set. However, I only got one pan.DO NOT BUY THIS. But if you do, lower your oven temp, as it tends to darken the cake exterior!I will use it for my sweetie on valentines day but after that it will be collecting dust until next year."
4,Traditional Regency,"An author I hadn't come across before. Deals with some of the less glamorous side of the times.From the back of the hardback:BATH 1826Mary Dravton's improvident father had lefther, on his death, in quite degradingcircumstances. So when Justin, LordHawkridge, fell in love with her, and she with him, Mary was heartbroken but not surprised when he apparently came to his senses.To find him again in Bath, years later, when she was on a mission of mercy, was a shock more so when he clearly thought that she had abandoned him! But nothing had changed; she was still an unsuitable match for him..."
1,Works fine for a while then NO DISC forever!,"This DVD player worked great for about 6 months but now it says NO DISC for any DVD, production or created, MP3 , audio, anything. Now it goes into the bin. Buy a better player, not worth US $ 70 for the short time it works."
5,Great Product - Great Company,"Best customer Service I've encountered in some time!This product had more features than any other company and at a very good price.Had a few questions and called their number and got one quick and responsive reply. Maybe because their in New Hampshire.This DXP-100 plays em all - CD, DVD, MP3, MPEG, AVI, JPEG's and of course DIV-X.Feature full and easy to use from the GITGO.Highly recommend both player and Company."
4,AVAYON DXP1000 VS RCA DRC240N DIVX DVD PLAYERS,"This unit wins HANDS DOWN against the RCA competition the DRC240N. It plays all DVDs +/- R/RWs, VCD, SVCD, RAW MPEG DISCS... If you want a unit after the warranty expires to receive upgrades in firmware for divx movies and compatible to play DVDS from 1 - 6 and you can set it to REGION 0 (PLAY DISCS FROM ALL REGIONS)!!!. Get this unit. If you also want to do your karoake bit use the mic inputs. I use my mic inputs to plug in my bass, guitar to jam along with my cds.I know the name AVAYON is not a popular name... but both players are made in China, and RCA/GE/SHINCO are same product and for the price this AVAYON is much better deal than the RCA. I returned my RCA DRC240N after comparing both AVAYON and RCA and calling RCA to learn their product has no upgrades and no future plans to upgrade the DIVX OR XVID firmware... Get the AVAYON at B&H; Photo or J&R; Music in NYC."
3,Worked for a while,"It worked nicely for a while, but started acting up after a few months. I had to take the case off and reset the optical assembly. I think it somehow got off gear/track.If you're looking to play a wide variety of formats from the net, you might look elsewhere. Avayon doesn't seem to be releasing new firmware to play formats like matroska, etc."
2,Returned Unit,"Returned unit. It would not play the over 200 DVDs I burned with my Nero software . I called customer support and talked with their engineer and he said the unit only supports burned DVDs burned with My Sonic.It was a great unit , but did'nt fit my criteria. I hope the company updates to a fully compatible unit. Another weird thing is that boasts supporting Nero Recode but does'nt support Burned Nero DVDs.The support line is very freindly ."
2,Not for 16:9 tv's,"I so wanted this player to work for me, it has a good de-interlacer and plays pretty much any video format you can think of. What it does not have is any kind of aspect ratio control for either DVD or other format video on a widescreen TV. The cheap Panasonic I was buying the Avayon to replace did this with ease. Divx and Xvid files of 16x9 video encoded at 640x368 that would probably look fine letterboxed on a 4x3 Tv, are stretched horizontally with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Most frustrating was when I sent an E-mail to Avayon's tech support to ask if there was some solution I had overlooked in the support materials, and got a response saying that my TV was set wrong(my tv does have aspect ratio control, but not with progressive scan). Also, the remote has an incredibly narrow field of effectiveness, and it wouldnt play files burned to TDK cd's from Costco, but all the other cd's I tried worked fine."
4,"Nice, though it was a sleeper","A coming of age novel, both in a literal and figurative sense. Young and old alike, the characters all realized in the end that whatever effect that other people have on them - genetically or otherwise, it is what they decide on what or who they will become that matters.The narrative was well put together, but I am a little bit wanting for more dialogue. Paragraphs seem to be unending, and they almost always lulled me to sleep."
1,Roxanne,"I am so glad that I took this book out of the library and didn't waste money on it. There was no plot to speak of, the characters were so sterotyped--Irish Catholics vs Italian Catholics, the domineering grandfather who conveniently dies...the parents don't use birth control and dad is shocked when his wife is once again pregnant...yawn, yawn...a silly and dull book that might have made for a short story--if the author could throw in a plot somewhere."
2,not my favorite,I LOVED One True Thing and Black and Blue -- but I just could not get into this book. I got half way through the book and still couldn't figure out the plot. I gave up...and reread One True Thing!
2,I wanted to give it more stars ....,"I wanted to, I really did! But I just can't bring myself to do it. I read ""One True Thing"" and ""Black and Blue"" and loved them both. My copy of ""Object Lessons"" mentions B&B on it, which should have been a dead givaway that this was a weak fledgling effort first novel by the author, which it was. Oh, it had it's moments, but they were few and far between. Overall the feeling was just sadness bordering on depression, the kind of novels that were in abundance in the 70's. Perhaps that's when she wrote it. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Object Lesson:Anticipation Sometimes Leads to Disappointment,"I read Anna Quindlen's column regularly, for over a decade, in ""The New York Times."" I clipped many of them and saved them. I thought she was a wonderful writer.I eagerly anticipated the publication of this, her first novel. As I said in my title, anticipation sometimes leads to disappointment. She's a great columnist, but a weak novelist (according to this humble reader; I know a very famous ""literary leader"" was quite taken with another of her novels).I gave away this book the minute I turned the last page, to a co-worker whose taste in literature was 180 degrees different than mine. I can't remember whether she liked it or not; I just remember how much I couldn't stand it (it was plain old BORING).My recommendation? Stick to Quindlen's NON-FICTION, and you won't be disappointed."
2,I finished it.,"Such a story of family relationships should have been written from the perpective of just one person. Connie's story - which to me was the real story - could have been told much more believably from Maggies eyes (and ears) while we watched Maggie grow. The telling felt fractured and the story inconsistent; eg how could Tom, with no apparent business knowledge immediately make sense of his father's business concerns?. We had sat insde Tom's head, but he showed us no such skills - and for me such inconsistencies lead to a loss of credibility. It reads as a first novel (maybe it is?) before the author has realised her strengths and abilities. It should have been so much better."
4,An excellent summer read,"I was required to read this book for ninth grade honors English, and I can definatly say I enjoyed it. I liked the way that so many different point of views were displayed, so you could look at the situations from all angles. I found the mother the most interesting, but the main character was also entertaining. It's hard to define the young girl's character, I found myself often thinking I had figured her out when she would do something completely different. I guess that's what makes this book so different, because I found it related a lot to real life. I definatly recommend this book, don't count on a fantastic plot, but more of an every-day one."
4,I found it hard to follow,"I had to read Object Lessons as a summer reading assignment going into my Junior year of High School and it was a very well developed novel. At first i couldn't really understand what was going on, but as i continued i seemed to really enjoy it more. I found it hard to follow though, because she kept changing the character as i read. Then i would get confused and have to go back and read it again. But what i could understand was very interesting to me because the problems that Maggie and Connie and Tom and Monica faced where sometimes difficult to deal with and sometimes rewarding. It was exciting in the end even though i had a few unaswered questions that made me confused. But for the most part i enjoyed the book and look forward to reading other books by Anna Quindlen. I heard Black and Blue is excellent!"
1,Unlistenable!,"This CD is truly dreadful. Combined with a technically poor recording audio these string musicians leave much to be desired in their playing and abilities. Their intonation is off. The rhythm is bad. They're not in tune with each other. There is little-to-no cohesiveness in the performance of these string players as they play ""together"" . . it's just BAD.The first note on the first track is just ""screechy-squeaky"" -- I thought there was something wrong with my car CD player as it began . .and then I realized I was listening to borderline-amateur string playing combined with a technically poor recording. Every track is so bad I simply found this CD ""unlistenable"" .....save your money!"
3,Good Purchase,It was intended to be a gift for a friend for Christmas and it proved to be a good choice.
5,Best cookies ever,I love these cookies because I can't find them on Grocery stores just liquor stores. I would highly recommend these cookies to anymore you will not be disappointed.
1,hiss and all,"I purchased this mic expecting it to be low noise and good pick up. But when I used it, it was horrible. The noise was extremely noticeable and the range of picking sound was bad also. I used a preamp with this and nothing better. I raised volume and it increased in noise. Unless your camcorder has a horrible mic, don't spend money on this one since my pv-gs12 camcorder has a mic with the same noise as this one!!and the movie I'm making is called ""Aspire"" its a musical starring Marilu Bustamante and directed by Alphonso Sanchez. Since its musical it really needs good quality audio. Yet if you're making a movie and can't aford a good shotgun mic, simply redub all the audio and use a condenser mic. Its worth the work instead of audio noise."
1,Pure Junk - Doesn't Work,"Mine was dead right out of the box. The battery installation is very stupid. Poorly engineered, but even after I did that, there was a lot of buzzing and hissing, but no actual audio output. Azden is a low-end company that makes trash. Buy the real thing. It's worth the extra cash. I have been a professional videographer all of my life, so I know what I'm talking about."
4,"Great Game, but EA can improve it in the future","I've been playing collegiate rugby for four years now, and I've been waiting for a video game about rugby ever since. Rugby 2002 was heavily anticipated by myself and my teammates, to replace the 1998 ""Great Rugby"" Japanese release that we had been using on our PSX.Overall I think it is a great game, the controls are easy to use, but it takes time to learn them, and the importance of each aspect of the game. I like how you are in control of everything, from raking to hooking to rucks/mauls etc. The graphics aren't excellent, but they're good enough for everyone I know. It will take some work to get them up to the Madden standard, but oh well.The only real compalaint I have is that the game is too focused on the backline. I have never seen 8 men in a ruck. The entire crash/bang facet of the game is missing, as every time you get the ball you spin it out wide.I still give it 4 out of 5."
3,Not as good as the '95 version; rent first,"The three games I was most excited about when I purchased my PS2 were Madden 2001, Silent Hill 2 and Rugby. I owned the original '95 version on the Sega (before playstation). It was a great game. This games stats are unreadable. I'm 30 and have 20/20 vision and on a 35"" tv I can't read the names to sub players in for. The scrum isn't as realistic as it once was either. The gameplay is average. Tourneys, league play and stats are disappointing. Maybe the next time out EA will get it right with Rugby. Off to sell this and get college football 2002 for ps2."
2,Camera angle PLEASE!!,"Ok, this games cool if you leave out the corny camera angle the language that nobody knows like ""line-out, scrum"", and crap like that. I wish somebody would just make a game without trying to go overboard. Unfortuanetly they did."
2,Not great,"I was pleased that Ea sports finally decided to release rugby in the USA. However if you are expecting the allround excellence of Madden 2001 you will be disappointed. it seems like they just chucked it together in a rush. The graphics are poor, every player is the same size,compare this to Madden where the players are indiduals and have a resemblance to the guy. There is no sidestep button, and the players do not have name/number icons, so you never know who has the ball. This is a major fault, would you want the hooker kicking the ball upfield? or a prop making a long pass from scrum half?? This is a major weakness. I'm just very disappointed that the guys that brought us an amazing comparable game like madden on PS2, could also bring us a game that looks like it shouls be a sega game from 1991!! oh dear."
4,Hmmm...,"What is supposed to be rugby feels more like Mario Party. The idea that you have to tap buttons to get the ball is ludacris, and I hope they do the next one differently. (If there even will be a next one.)"
1,must be joking,"im sorry but if anyone has played johna lomu rugby for playstation one then im sure they will be just as dissapointed as i am with this excuse of a game. i am aware that johna was not available for america but with the advances that developers are claiming with the playsation two, how can a game released five years ago for the playsation one be so supperior to this effort from EA sport, who i may add have done so well with their other sport games. No sidesteps in a game of rugby, thats like having no slam dunking in a basketball game!How can a company like EA sport fail to improve on a game produced five years ago by codemasters????"
4,Frommer's first try with Tahiti...,"is suprisingly good! Probobly because it is based on the Tahiti section of the South Pacific guide (now in 10th edition) it doesn't contain most of the first edition problems - inacurate info, little info etc. It is really nicely researched and though it is quite a slim volume it is really helpful. One of the best guides to Tahiti & Her Islands."
2,Would not buy again,"Purchased the kindle edition during a 5 week visit to French Polynesia. Although its clear the author has visited the islands, we found the information in the book to be quite high level and not giving us much information we had not been able to find out ourselves from simply being at the location. We found Lonely Planet to be more informative in terms of recommending more off the beaten path restaurants, hotels, etc."
2,its not that great,What it contains is useful though I don't know how up to date it is since it is from 2007. I expected more. I din't think it was all that great.
3,"Informative, but could have used more pictures and maps","Informative, but could have used more pictures and maps.A lot has changed in the last several years with the depressed economy, so blogs on TripAdvisor were more useful."
4,Tahiti Bible,We went to FP for our honeymoon and this book was an enormous help. We ate at some of the recommended restaurants and they were fantastic.
5,Listing is missing track 10,"Track 10 is ""Hobo's Flat"". A great jazz album from a very talented lady."
1,still waiting,I am sorry to say that I cannot review this product because I never received it. I have not received any correspondence on why I have not gotten my CD.
3,Where's the Blueberry,"Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Granola was fresh tasting and crunchy, but I am not detecting any apple or blueberry flavor, it tastes like plain granola to me."
3,"Pretty good, a little sweet for me","I thought this granola was high quality, with fine ingredients. I like the apple and blueberry flavor. I found this flavor a little overwhelming, however, perhaps because it was so sweet. It's not a bad product, and it may just be personal preference, but I don't see myself ordering this again because of how sweet it was."
2,Not great,"Must admit that if I hadn't read that this Red Mills had apple and blueberry I would never have noticed it, taste-wise. There are a few dark flecks in the package which I presume are the blueberries but you would never know.Prior to this I had the Back To Nature blueberry granola (that particular variety not sold at Amazon). You can smell the blueberries when you open the package and the blueberries are very noticeable. I have milk on mine and it actually turns blue from the berries. These packs are also resealable whereas the Red Mill are not. Probably won't be buying it again."
2,Bland!,I've been looking for a nice granola to use everyday with my yogurt.Hoping that the Red Mill would be chewy but it is definitely not - it's quite bland and has a cardboard like texture.I definitely wouldn't recommend this if you plan on using it to add a kick to your morning yogurt.Maybe it's best to get something with a little fat - but I've had non-fat granola that is much tastier than this red mill.The one redeeming quality of this product is that you do get quite a lot for your money - unfortunately I ended up giving it to friends because I wasn't a fan.
1,"Panasonic EY9PM11D 4-3/8"" Thin Metal Cutting Blade","This blade will cut thinner metal than the standard blade, but it will NOT cut sheet metal as claimed. The blade kicks back and the teeth are easily damaged. If you want to cut sheet metal, get a Skil saw and turn the standard wood cutting blade around backwards. It does a much better job than the Panasonic, and it is a whole lot cheaper!!! If you want to cut 1/8"" or thicker, this blade works ok."
2,Nothing interesting. Skip this book,"One of the most uninteresting books about intelligence.Can easily stand as an appendix of the much more interesting and useful book written by one of the authors - Christopher Andrew with Vasili Mitrokhin - The sword and the shield. The Mitrokhin archive ... vol. I."" or the book written by the same authors KGB The inside story of its Foreign Operations..."".There is nothing useful inside this book.The text is so dry with nothing interesting, that after reading the book just once I felt no need to read it again.Save your money and simply skip this book with no emotions."
3,"It's good, but could have been better GWAR","Basically, Blood Bath & Beyond is indeed a retrospective DVD documentary of archive footage spanning throughout GWAR's entire bloodshed upon the world. Hosted by Oderus Urungus and Sleazy P. Martini, it's set up like an award show where the material shown represents nominated work.There's much to see, and some hilarious (bordering on sick) extra features, but being a retrospective DVD I do miss some more background, in-deep reflections by GWAR's members. BalSac, Beefcake, Flattus, Jizmak along with Techno Destructo and Sexecutioner should all have gotten some space to contribute with explainations, look-backs and thoughts. As it is now, the footage kind of have to speak for itself and knowing GWAR it is not always easy to make out where in the timeline to place what.Overall I enjoy it as a GWAR movie, but it doesn't get as high as it aims."
3,Vintage GWAR - but some of it's not that great,"I just got the DVD and it has some really nice stuff on it (particularly the Hell-O Again Medley, which I saw them perform at the first 20th Anniversary show at Starland Ballroom). But the quality of most of the footage is what bogs this down a bit. A large portion of the footage is so horribly video taped that you can barely make out what is going on. Some of it is interesting, and definitely worth a look for a die-hard GWAR fan."
4,Not all punk is from orange county,"Believe it or not these school boys from Australia can really rock! not as famous as some of our other exports Loki have a great Pop-punk sound without the attitude that some other bands of their genre are famous for. All in all it fast fun and anyone listening to Blink, Fenix or alike should check these guys out."
3,informative,"For someone going from piano to dulcimer, this is a big help. It's pretty comprehensive on showing how to hold the hammers. It also goes over flags, drags and rolls, chords, such. Sheet music itself is limited, but on some, it provides brief background on the pieces. It's great for an introduction for a beginner, but it's best if you already know how to read music."
2,Cheap.. you get what u pay for.,no problems. that said it is one of the cheapest feeling socket set i've ever used. I just needed it for the metric bits.Update:Some of theses cheap Metric sockets cracked
4,Helpflul to those who sufferd childhood trauma,It's very sad when those who have been abused are sought after to be discredited. It sure makes it hard to be a vicitim and not be belived because people are always out to discredit things they don't want to belive happen. Stripped Naked is a testimony of one woman's walk through Mulitiple Personalites.. a ray of hope for others like her out there.
1,She is a FAKE,"For those of you who actually believe she went through all this, and think that anyone who speaks against her like she is some kind of saint, look for yourself, everything about her is unreal, she wrote another book claiming to be Raped, abused and forced into satanic rituals, then she claimed to be a concentration camp survivor. I understand that these books she has written may have touched a lot of people but there is no proof other than her own words, that she is who she claims to be."
1,A Sad Coda to a Tragic Life,"One hates to speak ill of the dead. However, the late Ms. Stratford successively claimed to be a survivor of ""Satanic ritual abuse"", a survivor of the Holocaust, and someone with multiple personalities.(In fact, some of the ""ritual abuse"" she discusses in the book ""Satan's Underground"" and some of the ""concentration camp experiences"" she related in appearances with pseudo-survivor Binyamin Wilkomirski ""took place"" simultaneously--it would be a remarkable feat for Satan himself to place his victim in Washington State and a Jewish children's detention center in Krakow, Poland at the same time!)It's hard to separate the knowledge of Ms. Stratford's tragic delusions from a reading of her prose, which is incoherent and disorganized. The heartbreaking truth is that she would have been better served by psychological and spiritual counseling that brought her closer to reality than by gullible acceptance of her wild stories."
1,"A well written book of ""Christian Porn""","Lauren Stratford has been investigated by a number of Evangelical ministries and has been shown to be a writer of fiction. Her first book, Satan's Underground was exposed and withdrawn by the original publisher. I feel that it is safe to assume that nothing in her current book relates to real events. A fun book if you approach it as a piece of fiction."
2,Good try,I read this book two years ago and again this week. It actually made no difference at all to me and I read it with a open mind . It is as other reviewers have mentioned incredibly repetitive of the one idea and this was the hardest part. I kept waiting to get to the part where he gives the solution but it never came. It is however a book that is easy to read and advances Tolles book on the same idea the Power of now .
1,Borrowed Ideas,"Most all of the concepts in the book are taken from other writers and philosphies. I found nothing original in this book. In addition, the author's antedotal stories seemed contrived and unrealistic."
1,Not Worth the Time to Read,"Try Happiness Now; it's a much better book. Once I read Happiness Now, skimmed this one and realized it was not as well written as the others."
1,spend your money on a good camera,"I bought this camera less than a year ago. I had it die on me once and i had it exchanged for a different one, after getting the run around from panasonic. A few days ago the camera has just died on me again. There is a 1 year waranty right, no that just covers the cost of parts, labor is on you, which is a $90 flat rate, plus $12 to ship. If you are thinking about buying this camera, you are best off looking else where."
2,Complete Waste of Money,"This wasn't worth the $90 I paid for it, not by a long shot. ALL the pictures are black and white. I suppose I should have looked closer. It's very dry and technical in presentation. I thought it would be a fun book to give my wife on Christmas because she likes antique fans. Please don't waste your money on this!!"
3,Collector's Guide to Electric Fans: Identification and Values,This is a comprehensive volume on many of the hundreds of makes & models from the end of the 19th century to late 20th with enough information to satisfy the collector. It doesn't list all makes or all models of each make so if you have an obscure one or just one that doesn't make the list you will be disappointed. The values can be out of date and the updates may not be available since it was originally published 1997. It is a valuable research tool however.
2,Made of thin paper - easily damaged - got wet - worthless,"I was disappointed with these - you can't tell how light and thin they are from the photos. They are made out of light paper. I would have gotten something more durable and not wasted money on these if I had known. When they are in the camera bag they get crumpled and damaged easily, and if they get wet (I should have known!) they turn into a soggy mess. For a paper card printed with black, grey and white paint, these are too expensive."
1,Unbelievably Small and Useless,"I looked and looked for a size when I was buying and then just decided to get it thinking it must be reasonable - but no, it is like 1 square inch and absolutely useless to me. I'm no good at returning things so I'm just out the $20."
2,"Not Durable, Easily Damaged, Hard to Carry intactly","The grey card was made of a thin, piece of paper. What happens when you have a small piece of paper in your pocket,or in your bag? The paper is easily bended, scratched, scrambled... that's what will happen to the card shortly after you take it out."
5,Affirmation!,"What a wonderful book! It helps one to explore the identity of a good teacher - a truly valuable focus for professional development in any type of school. The authors explore the characteristics of a ""good teacher"" including ethics, patience, love of learning, and - imagine! - pleasure! That is, one should only be a teacher if one enjoys teaching! Wish a few of my teachers had considered that notion. If you are a ""born teacher,"" this book will affirm you and remind you of why you do it!"
3,Interesting Tips for Future Teachers,"As a future teacher, I found this book to be an interesting and informative guide to succesful teaching. The sections and suheads were extremely effective in breaking out key capabilities. The Authority and Order chapters were especially enlightening. Downsides: The dialogue under each subhead was often crammed with so many thoughts it was difficult to determine the key messages. Redundancy was running wild across all chapters. Overall: Good key points, if you can uncover them."
5,Great Buy,"This text is considered The Bible for any political science person.The person that sent me that also was very prompt and sent me in a shape and condition that I had not imagined it would be.It's not ""Like New"", but actually new if I clean the name of the previous owner with an ink remover.Thank you. Ashutosh"
5,Superman floor mats are great,These mats I purchased for my son for christmas but they do look nice and I am sure they will be great in his car.
4,Justified,I am alright have not seen DVD yet but all is fine thank you looking forward to enjoy the DVD soon
1,"Cougars, inc.",Don't know what I did with this one but all I get is the selection where they talk about the film. Have never been able to see the actual film so do not know if I like it or not. Don't know if it's a defect in the DVD or if that was all it was to begin with.
3,College Entertainment,"I wanted a collegiate farce. That's what you get here. Strong performances (I think) by Jim (definite) and Kyle (sort of). Mindless entertainment, but worth a shot!"
5,The Best Movie You Have Never Heard Of,"This movie is available now via iTunes rental and I have watched it three times. The movie is unbelievable. The acting is great and so is the plot. Im not too sure what the other reviewer is talking about. I also would watch this movie with anyone, even my parents. I cannot wait for my pre-ordered blu-ray copy to show up. If you are debating whether to buy this, stop debating and just get it. That or rent it via iTunes first."
5,"PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, UNITE AND LISTEN TO JOO!!","One single remark: THIS IS NOT BOSSA NOVA! It's plainly JOO GILBERTO - you foreigners may not understand it, but the man himself has ALWAYS considered himself a SAMBA player, which means he plays brazilian music, or 'only' music - song n.2 (Undiu) is actually a 'baio', which (theoretically) has nothing to do with samba, like others on this album, but then a baio through zen-budism - Joo GIlberto...SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF J.G.: PLEASE PAY ATTENTION...and enjoy yourselves: this is not B.N., nor Samba - THIS IS PEACE!P.S. read J.G.'s notes on GETZ/GILBERTO and you'll know what I'm (actually he is) talking about."
5,Killer,"Sometimes referred to as The White Album (one of the few modern artists whose greatness can withstand comparison to that of the Beatles), this album was recorded sometime around 1970. Only Joao and a drummer are present, though then-girlfriend Miucha appears on one song. Somehow this album stands apart from all his others--maybe because it is so sparse, yet many of the numbers are up-tempo. He runs through ""Eu Vim da Bahia"" five times and makes it definitive. He brings a new and unexpected phrasing to ""Aguas de Marco."" He is at his most playful on ""Eu Quero um Samba"". And three tunes virtually do away with words altogether--""Undiu"" finds him hypnotically chanting the title word, ""Valsa"" finds him humming a lullaby to his daughter, and an astonishing instrumental version of ""Na Baixa do Sapateiro"" finds him at his most dexterous on the guitar. It's a near-perfect album."
3,Size Matters,"The 2-quart size was different than pictured, with upward protrusions on the handle connections; and the 4-quart size had tiny sharp protrusions inside the bucket from the handle connector. However, the 6, 9 and 13 quart sizes had no such problems."
2,Not the product in the picture - be aware,'Be aware that this is not the product in the picture with encased connection from handle to bucket.'I specifically selected the bucket because in the photo there is a covering over the spot where the handle is connected to the bucket.This is NOT what I received. The bucket I received was hazardous. The handle goes through a flap that protrude beyond the top of the pail. It is hooked on openly and can cause serious injury to the face and or eye of the dog. There are documented cases of such injury. I was able to have the open hook area crimped down and WELDED smooth. so that I can use safely the bucket.
1,I received an empty can.,"When I opened up my package I thought the can was oddly light but I didn't think too much on it. Then I followed the directions and tore off the locking tab on top of the can, held it upright, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. No air came out regardless of how firmly I held the trigger. Eventually I came to the conclusion that the ""10 oz"" can contained nothing whatsoever."
4,"Might not be 1 or 3,but a must for any rare AOR collection","""Who's Right,Who's Wrong"" has harmony parts that truly soar,with Kenny Loggins guesting with Page & George(my personal favorite tune from the album).""Sailor Song"",""Take My Heart Away""(although I prefer Ricky Peterson's 1990 version better),and ""Chemistry"" are worth the price of admission."
5,Richard Page & Steve George - Pre MisterMister,This CD brings back sooooo many memories....all good! The year was 1979 and I was a buding musician in college and I played the three PAGES albums I had to death. You can tell these guys listened to a few Steely Dan albums in their day. Hey AMAZON...find the other two albums and I can guarantee you two sales!
4,Many Possibilities,"Have you ever wanted to play Jepordy with a buzzered? Here is your chance. This game best feature is the remotes. They allow you to be standing across the room and buzzing in when you know or think you know the answer.""Answering the following question"" is interesting and fun. The ""finish the phrase"" is all right but sometimes you think ""WHO SAYS THESE PHRASES."" ""Finish the word"" is not as exciting and many times no one gets it or the person reading it says all the letters..If you want a variation on the game, come up with your own questions. If everyone who is playing comes up with questions that they know the answers to, you can challenge the other players in answering your questions.I'm a teacher and I give my students the definitions we're learning for the week to answer. They study and look forward to playing. Remote Possibilities allows you to do this and many other things I'm sure I've not discovered."
1,Don't waste your money,"This game sounded intriguing to me. It's an electronic trivia game where 6 contestants hold small remote controls which signal the main hand-held unit when a button is pressed. The biggest problem is the questions (which appear on the main unit) are far too easy. This is supposed to be for adults, but the questions are more appropriate for children. My second complaint is that the main hand-held unit must be passed around and manipulated by contestants who are already holding and manipulating remote controls. Great idea - poor execution. ""Cranium"" is a much better electronics trivia type game."
2,Not the best game I've played,"This game has the potential of being great but at this time it lacks a few features that could make it much better. First off, when someone clicks their remote to buzz in, if they get the answer incorrect, the question is over and it goes to the next question. There is no ramification for getting the answer wrong so someone could just buzz in first every time and not get any points taken away from them, nor do the other players get a shot at the answer. I think that other players should be able to guess after someone has answered incorrectly and a point should be automatically deducted for a wrong answer to discourage people from buzzing in when they do not know the answer. Also, the music and the voice instruction seem to be of a quality from electronic games years ago. I think I was expecting a little more from this game than I received."
4,Brit rock...with a twist,"This album I bought after hearing 2 songs on the radio. They sound kind of like what you'd expect the Beatles to sound like if they were founded in 1992. Sort of a combination of The Beatles, Oasis(just a hint), and The La's with a little alt rock sound thrown in for good measure. It retains a kind of recorded-ourselves feel to it which helps it. 4 stars because The La's album is the only perfect album I have ever heard."
4,An account of the causes of and punishment for violent crime,"Psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis Provides a fairly imformative account of the lives of violent criminals, the causes of their behavior, and their punishment. This book is based on her experiences interviewing murderers on death row. For a far more informative, more profound, and persuasive account of violence, its causes and punishment, I suggest reading James Gilligan's book VIOLENCE: REFLECTIONS ON A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC."
4,"Excellent Read, but...","I started reading this book, and found myself unwilling to put it down until I completed it. It confirmed what many of us in mental health services believe- that killers are created, not born. There were a few elements missing that I would have liked to see in the book. I wonder what the prevalence or the changes in killers post-Reagan era, when federal funding was drastically cut to mental health services (especially psychiatric hospitals). I can't help but think if psychotic parents weren't able to have children and torture them, would there be less killers today. I was disappointed to find that Dr. Otnow did not reference any treatments to help her clients. As a therapist, I would want to know if there are effective treatments available to utilize with human beings so damaged. Despite these deficits, it is still a great read."
2,An Invitation to Voyeuristic Readers,"This book has the attraction of a car wreck. Ooh, look, somebody's worse off than me!It's interesting in a time-passing way, but the evidently low priority it occupied in the author's and publisher's minds is evidenced by several howling bloopers, of which the worst is on page 187 of the hardbound version, where pathetic proofreading produces the sentence,""A death row psychiatrist's allegiance is torn between Hypocrites and the state."" Umm, really? How about Hippocrates?If you can get the book free and wish a pastime of creepy head cases, this is the book for you."
5,Excellent,"This is a great book about a doctor who works with inmates on death row. She interviews famous people like Ted Bundy. It is really liberal minded though which didn't change my mind about the death penalty, but it was an interesting look from another person's perspective."
1,The Author is Guilty of being Delusional,"I had the misfortune to waste several hours reading this tripe and would have to put it down, shake my head, and marvel at how naive a ""trained professional"" could be. I am a criminal defense attorney and have become a pretty good detector as to when I am being conned. Dr. Lewis fails to possess this quality and actually manages to feel compassion for someone like Ted Bundy and many other cold-blooded killers that she profiles. Sure, a crummy home life can scar you for life, but there are plenty of people who had crummy lives as children and have managed to live their lives without harming anyone - much less brutally murdering someone. Give me a break - some people just come out of the box broken and the only way to ""fix"" them is to remove them from society...permanently."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,This has to be the worst book I have read in a very long time. Dr. Lewis appears to think she is just one step behind God. This book is very poorly written and full of Dr. Lewis blowing her horn. I sure am glad this witch has never crossed my path. She is probably on her broomstick as this is being written.
1,Shrink Murders English,"A good and interesting topic cruelly tortured by awriting style that is by turns sophomoric, gossipy,insipid, and insensitive. Examples: the author relates,obviously with relish, a cruel and stupid ""joke""regarding Ted Bundy told by her husband (Mel). We geteverybody's name whether they matter to the narrativeor not: e.g. the author's children. They are Gillian andEric and who could give less of a damn? She recountsan interview with a murderer from ""...the Deep South"" andthen has to go to the ""Deep South"" for the interview. Thekiller's words are rendered in a kind of Dogpatchese (""I'd""is spelled ""Ah'd"" and so on) that the author seems tofind amusing. We don't. But it typifies the odd, abruptand off-putting shifts of tone that fatally undermine thewhole enterprise, bringing it perilously close to drivel."
1,Disappointing!,"Reviews that I read rated this book very highly. I expected to read about agressive adolescents journey into homicidal adults and what we, as a society, can do to help these children and prevent the tragedy of a wasted life. Instead, the author ""boasts"" that she is the last woman to kiss a convicted murderer who was a known necrophiliac (Ted Bundy). The first 102 pages deal more with the author and her gastrointestinal problems, her commute from New Haven, CT to New York City, and to be sure and always have a Snickers bar with you. The author does not even begin to discuss the subject of the book until the 102nd page of the book. The book has 332 pages (paperback). If you are expecting insights into the world of troubled adolescents, let alone the mind of death row inmates, you will be very disappointed."
2,"Some interesting comments, some nonsense...","When I picked up this book,I wanted a different viewpoint on this subject. Be aware, the book is biased against capital punishment. However, Dr. Lewis makes some interesting points about neurology and the committing of violent crimes that may need to be looked at further. Our current methods of treating criminals and crimes seems to exclude, as Lewis' book points out, recognition of true incapacitation. It also points out glaring gaps in the judicial system with regard to handling juvenile offenders. In this world of increasing numbers of violent children who commit violent crimes, we would do well to begin taking another look at how we handle such cases. Lewis' book is worth reading, if only for a different point of view."
4,A thought-provoking thriller,"A non-fiction collection of violent murder cases in which the author-psychiatrist was involved in assessing the sanity of the killers. Great stories and story-telling. If you enjoy watching ""Criminal Minds,"" I think you'd find this book very engrossing."
3,Read the second half of the book,"The title of this book is misleading. The first half of this book is rather slow with too much info about her herself. If she wanted to write an autobiography she should have done that separately.The author dedicates about three pages to explain how she became the last woman to kiss Ted Bundy. Why is this important?The second half of the book gets much more interesting and focused on the topic: the people who are committing the crimes and their motivations, their histories, and their early years.I give the second part of the book three stars and the first part one."
3,Fascinating read BUT terrible e-book formatting,"I enjoyed the interesting look at the author's work with violent criminals. I found it fascinating. BUT (big BUT!) the e-book was formatted terribly. Hundreds of typos that appear to be caused by scanned text that wasn't proofed well. ""I"" became ""1"". ""The"" became ""Die"". A forward slash instead of ""I"". Spelling mistakes. What a mess. I started making a personal note in my e-book every time I found a typo but gave up after 75 notations...."
3,INTERESTING,"THIS BOOK IS AN INTERESTING READ.I FOUND DR. OTNOW-LEWIS INFORMATIVE AND NOT AS DRY AND CLINICALAS I EXPECTED FROM A PSYCHIATRIST.SHE DOES , HOWEVER, BELIEVE THAT MURDERERS ARE A PRODUCT OF BIOLOGICAL INFLUENCES.ALSO, I FOUND SOME OF THE INFORMATION IN ERROR, ESPECIALLY IN RESPECT TO HER STUDIES INVOLVING TED BUNDY.HER CASE STUDIES ARE BASED ON HER OWN CLINICAL OPINIONS,AND MAY NOT REFLECT THOSE OPINIONS OF EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE."
5,spices,I was very surprised by how much the package had as well as for the price which is a great value. The product got here very fast. I will buy more in the future.
2,Turmeric was over a year old,"The bag I received in September of 2012 was packed in April 2011, and is marked best before 24 months. So sixteen out of the 24 months have already elapsed. The amount is certainly generous, and the price is very low."
5,Tasty Turmeric,"Very fresh and fragrant turmeric. The 7-oz. bag is quite large, equivalent to 3-1/2 of the expensive 2-oz. bottles I had been buying at the grocery store."
3,"Good game, so-so graphics","Just goes to show you that being on the PS2 doesn't mean the graphics are phenomenal. This is a good game, with a couple of different modes to play in. The hardest thing is gauging how high/low you are in relation to the people/buildings, and the controls are VERY awkward at first (but become a little less awkward as you play and get used to them.). I wish I had bought it used because it wasn't worth (the price)."
1,Can't believe it's a Rockstar game,"City Crisis -- 0.85 starsCity Crisis is a total waste of money. poor graphics and sound, downright horrid control. You fly helicopters around, recuing people from buildings and following criminals in high-speed pursuits. I will say that it is an original idea."
3,Hmmm .... must think wisely .,Don't expect any awesome graphics in here becasue you'll get very normal graphics in this game. The only reason the keeping this game attractive is the style of gameplay. People who love helicopters might love this game but for me it's ok to play when you get bored with other games.
1,Complete wate of time,"This game [stinks]. Don't buy it. The graphics are par for a 64 bit system, not PS2. The play control is beyond terrible. There is no variation on the weather... it is always sunny and clear, and the missions are long-winded and stupid. The music is annoying as well. Don't waste the [money] even to rent it."
5,the beat game eva,This game deserves five stars!*****. This game Rocks my world! the graphics are unbelievible. It is whut playstaytion 2 is all about. The controlls were so easy to learn. so get City Crisis and through out all tohose stupid games like GTA3!!!!!!!!!!
2,not a good bet,"If you are used to SSX and Smuggler's Run type of graphics thisis not you game. The stly of gameplay seems slow and not very interesting, it also is a unpleasent reminder of September 11th, putting out fires in burning buildings will not get my liking or intrest for a few years."
3,Kind of fun,"I don't know what to say, this game is kind of fun, but really lacks any real replay value. You play as a chopper pilot who flies around the city either putting out fires and rescuing people or helping the police track down a bad guy. It can be fun, sending your little guy down a rope to pull up some poor little person, but it gets boring. Decent graphics and control are the only really high points for this title, and the number of modes are low, (3)."
1,City Crisis,Flying a Helicopter around and saving people never seemed any fun to me. It would have been better if it was a car game I think.
5,Time Saver,All of our superintendents learned and adopted the program sooner than we had anticipated. It has been a great time saver and cost saver.
5,Birnbaum's Walt Disney World,"I purchased this book for my first trip with the kids. His sugesstions were right on the money. Staying in disney with small children was a VERY smart idea. When they were hot and tired we went to the pool to cool off. Then back to the parks we went. I felt sorry for the other parents when their children were crying, and tired , no place to rest even for an hour. My only suggestion would be to take a case of bottled water for the entire trip. I felt water was very expensive to buy at the parks. We stayed at a place that offered free soda refills after you purchased the mug. HUGE saving for a family of four, but we didn't want to carry them to the parks. We spent at least one hour at the hotel during the peak heat hours to rest , then back to the parks."
5,"Biased or not Bisaed, This Book is a Must-Have","I feel that this book is the best for information about Walt Disney World. Though it does not rate restaurants or resorts, or give an opinion about which is better, this book gives excellent information about the Walt Disney World Resort. This book is designed for the person who is definately planning a trip to Walt Disney World, not simply considering it. If you are doing your entire vacation within WDW property, then this is the guide to get. If you want opinions, then search for them on the internet. Any book will be biased. For a completely unbiased opinion then look for personal websites about people's vacation to Walt Disney World. For a comprehensive and informative giude to Walt Disney World, choose this book."
2,Propoganda,"This is just fluff from Disney. It isn't much more helpful than getting the map once you are inside the park. We had a wonderful Disney trip, but it was made better by the Unofficial Guide to the park. If you like to see glossy pictures and brag sheets, get this book. However, if you want advice on where to stay and how to save some money, get the Unofficial Guide. It is much more helpful."
4,super cool,"Hi everyone,From someone who doesn't like piano music very much I really like the CD. I just wanted to write a review cause everyone should have at least one review."
5,GREAT HONKY TONK ROCK,"One of the great forgotten bands of the late 80s, The Delta Rebels tore it up, especially live in concert. Their CDs are really difficult to find, so if you get a chance, be sure to snatch it up."
5,Amazing!,"This is one of the best books I could have ever bought. I am a student teacher right now and I learned a variety of strategies just from reading this book. It makes you want to just go out and conquor the classroom. I would reccommend any teacher, or prospective teachers to buy this book! It is wonderful. Thank you Ms. Breaux!"
5,Gospel Hill,This was a very interesting movie. Started out slow but the movie picked up and I really enjoyed it so I would suggest movie lovers who like the later life settings view it.
3,"Watch for Actors, Not story","The Actors are great, The Story is good, but the movie did not flow well to me. It was worth one viewing but,I probably won't watch it again."
1,Leaks entire contents,"I just bought one of these figuring it would last longer and be more durable than the plastic versions, but it does not hold water. It overflows the basin and leaks its entire contents within an hour. Must be a tiny leak somewhere. What a hassle. Poor quality product. I tried calling the listed customer service number and it doesn't work either."
3,hook slides on handle and spills,This items would have been great if the handle had a place to hang it that wouldn't slide. Soaked my coop floor.
4,"Sturdy, easy care",Nice sturdy product. Easy to clean and works very well. I would have given it 5 stars if it could be hung.
1,Still looking for a good watering solution,"I did get a couple of years out of it, but it is starting to rust. It hangs ok, but the handle is made for carrying not hanging so it ""slips"" all the time causing it to drain out. Which leaves the chickens out of water all the dang time. Still looking for a GOOOOD hanging replacement...tried plastic and this."
1,Leaked..,"That thing leaked all over my coop, no matter if it was leveled or not. The bottom seal was the problem , I resealed it with aquarium silicone (safe for food) and now it keeps water. I did not want to go thru returning and paying for shipping so I fixed it. I should have made one myself. Seller did send me shipping fee back to my account for my trouble."
4,Plenty of water,Delivered in a timely manner and in good shape.It gives the chickens enough water for us to leavethem on their own for 6 or 7 days.
3,bottom rusting out,"I just had my 3rd one rust out - the bottom develops little pin-hole leaks. I generally like the product, but feel it should be more durable. The last one lasted less than a year."
1,Rusty junk,I've had this product for less than a year. It is full of rust and has to be replaced. Kept out of the weather and used just for water - which is its intended purpose. So why is it full of rust?
3,drinkable water level shallow,"I'm sure this fount is just fine for chickens, but it really doesn't work well for all but the youngest goslings. The water in the drinking pan is not deep enough for geese older than a couple weeks to immerse their bills in, which of course geese need to be able to do."
1,i do not recomend this product,"the product arrived quickly, but it was damaged and unusable. it was a waste of money to ship the the item here and back to return it when i could have got the same thing (only better) for less from my local feed mill"
2,handle problem,Bought in May for chickens handle weld broke and no more hanging waterer....if you only set this on ground it should be ok. Hanging lets us set the waterer at the right height for chicks as they grow. Only 4 months and broken doesnt speak well for this item.
3,Must be too small,"I only have two ducks and they sucked through the water in a day. Too much trouble so I went back to a bowl, which I also have to change everyday. Now it is just taking up space in my laundry room. Would recommend for baby ducklings only."
4,Sagwa Bow Wow Meow,As my family is made up of both biological and adopted children I found this book very helpful. We adopted acrossed race lines so our sons do not look like our biological family. This book gave us a warm and loving way to talk about how the world might see them and whether that matters in making us a family. Books about looking different because of adoption for this age group are hard to find. I would recommend this book to any family with young children involved in transracial adoption.
4,Motorola talkabout 250,"The motorola talkabout 250 is an excellent product. It may not have some of the features that some of the other do, but is a very good radio. If you plan on using it in very populated areas, some radios with better scan features may work better for you. But, if you plan on using it out in the more open country, it is a very good choice. For camping,hunting,backpacking or any other outdoor sports it is probably the best. It has excellent range and I feel is the most durable radio on the market. For example, I was using mine when rock climbing with some friends, accidentally I dropped mine 100 feet on to a rock ledge. Amazingly the radio still works. It had a few cracks but we still use it today."
3,"Great Radio , but battery life too short","I find this radio indispensable on the ski slopes, especially since my wife & I are at different skill levels. We often hook up for a few runs, then separate again. My one problem is the battery life is too short, I'm constantly buying new batteries after 2 days. I would steer people towards the 280 model with Nicad rechargable batteries."
1,disappointing,Sound quality was disapponting.I purchased the vox headphones and microphone accessory only to find it basically useless. I had to practically shout into the mike to get it to pick up and transmit. I returned the three radios and headsets that I ordered.
2,battery eater!,When I looked at these 'family radios' I thought I'd spend the extra money and get something good in a Motorola. Range is low and they eat batteries like crazy. I would not buy another unless it comes with a charger. Richard
4,"Great Radio, but don't get it wet!","I love these radios. I have used these at the beach, shopping, camping, etc., and find them extremely useful. They are clear, and easy to use. They also work great between cars if you are on a long trip with multiple cars.The only warning is that even though they are extremely sturdy, just don't get them wet! They are not good for fishing or canoeing trips, or anywhere else where they are likely to be exposed to water. If splashed heavily with water, or, heaven forbid, submerged, they will malfunction and become useless. Unfortunately this happened to me. Motorola was great about fixing them, but moisture damage is not covered under the warrantee. They did sell me a brand new replacement for $40, which was a pretty good deal, considering."
4,Great for skiing (but not perfect),"Bought a pair of Motorola 250's just before our trip to Northstar at Lake Tahoe, CA. The radios worked well when people were in different locations on the same run or on the lifts. However, sometimes people at different locations on the mountain could not communicate with one another. I was unable to connect with my wife until late in the day when I tried one last time -- but she came in loud and clear. When they work, they're so much better than waiting at the top or bottom of a run to sync up for rendezvous, lunch, or departure plans. But expect to try several times from several locations before connecting with other members party. Also expect that you may have to relay messages to reach all members of your party (if you have 3 or more radios)."
1,Bait and Switch!,Ordered 13 sets of (12) as advertised... received 13 individual pens. The advertisment said on sale for $5.46 (originally $34.99 84% off) How could they be $34.99 each for a paint stick.
1,dim bulb in the big city,"Mebus seems like a nice guy, and it doesn't thrill me to say this, but alas, his first novel is tiresome and dull. Do yourself a favor and save your money until this fella learns to write. Maybe someday he will blossom, but at this point he can't expect anyone to take him seriously with this tired collection of scrapings from the comedy-club floor. Really, there is nothing here that wasn't a cliche by about 1987."
2,"It shoudn't be titled as ""booty nomad""!!!","There are a few parts of the book which I found funny. What happened to the main character is far less interesting than the others. And the main character who is such a weak and useless man is quite unrealistic. The whole book without any sex scenes bored me. It shouldn't named ""booty nomad"", it should be called ""a guy circling around for mad long and ends up in the starting point where he never gets any booty!""."
2,smart but boring,"Hard to believe that a book about a recognizably smart and educated hipster meandering through the terrain of love and lust could be so dull, especially considering how hard he tries to be funny. Not a laugh to be had, not one."
4,just fun,"This book is so good! It's not like an award winner, but it is so funny! Plus, there are a lot of insights about friends and love and embarassing things that ring so true."
1,a big pile of nothing,"This book is just embarrassingly amateurish and awful. Mebus's characters make sitcom characters look like Shakespearean figures, his dirty jokes are vaguely misogynist, his writing ranges from bland to offensive. I'm sorry I bought it."
1,fresh as last Tuesday's sushi,"I tried to get into this book, but as the narrator whines and fusses and tosses out lame dirty joke after lame dirty joke, I got tired and gave up. Life is too short, and Booty Nomad is too long."
1,stale gags,"Booty Nomad is sort of like a standup comedy routine you'd see at a Jersey City lounge in 1959. There aren't any original ideas here, the writing is uninspired and I found the none-too-subtle misogyny (all the female characters are boiled down to one trait: i.e., the Eater of Souls, who seems to have been pretty wise to have dumped the narrator, and Bendy Girl) less than amusing. Overall, it's a lot of tired, whiny, schtick. I couldn't finish it."
2,from heroes to zeroes,"this cd sees the crr's change direction. they've changed so much they no longer sound like the same group. this has a lot to do with the departure of daniel wylie. when he left the group, the band were left with inferior songwriting and now lack direction. they sound like third grade u2 and that's no lie. not even one song on this cd can save it. i'll give 'emptiness' pass marks but only because it's best in very bad company. if you expect to hear the same sound as the classic 'enjoy the melodic sunshine', you will be major disappointed. this record can't hold a candle to 'enjoy'. so it's major, major, disappointment."
1,Ineffective,"I have purchased several supplements from VAXA over the years; unfortunately, Prostatin provided me absolutely no benefit whatsoever. That being said, I would try other VAXA items again in the future."
2,"Boring, more boring, most boring","This is the most painfully boring book I have ever read. I grant that it is well written but it makes my teeth ache, it is so boring. I cannot believe the praise plus the Booker prize, but trust me, it is beyond any interest that anybody could have."
3,I read the book at the back of Hotel Du Lac,"All I can say is that the book is not a true image of the hotel nor the place, (Vevey Switzerland) itself. But this was passed as a fiction so scratch that out and give this award-winning novel a break.I just saw on Amazon that there's a used book for $0.47, go click on that and keep this book as part of your collection.Could have been a 2-star, but I have a penchant for reading books such as Tojours Provence and Bella Tuscany in the exact places that they were described in the book. So sentimental me....huhuhu"
1,Regret Reading This,"I read this novel in a modern contemporary literature class in college. The professor assigned the book without having read it first, and he apologized for this mistake later. The novel lacks any sort of higher meaning, therefore making it a mediocre plot story with one-dimensional characters. The conflicts are trivial and leave the reader to wonder, why bother? Don't be fooled by whatever award this book won. If you're a literature fan and value insight and meaning in a book, you'll be highly disappointed. Fiction? Yes. Literature? No. If you're interested in the themes explored by Brookner, you should read Jane Austen or the Brontes instead -- at least they add some amount of art to their work."
4,A good book I'd recommend.,"It took me forever to get into ""Hotel du Lac."" I love Jane Austen and I love Anne Tyler and this books sorta straddles both and was recommended to me by a used bookstore owner who said his wife liked it.Finally after several chapters I got hooked and I read it slowly enough to relish it. I lived in Geneva and Basle so I could understand the place and was fascinated to read her version of Lake Geneva. The book slowly unfolds and has the unexpected twists you get in mysteries and at the end you are still puzzling - it isn't so neat in fact like a good movie it makes you want to go out and discuss it with others. The reviews here make me think the people who are reading it prefer action novels and would be the last people I'd like to discuss this book with.But I really loved it. I'm only sorry every one says it's her best as I'd like to read others by her and not be disappointed."
1,Couldn't get into it...does it get better?,"Ick. Really boring. I was really in the mood to read, and after 10 pages I gave it up. Very flat and airless.Is this one worth being patient about? Might read 'Falling Slowly' instead since that one seems to be a Brookner favorite."
5,Hotel du Lac - a nice and leisurely read without too much tension or drama,"I really enjoyed this book, partly because I could identify with the main female character though my life circumstances are not particularly similar. I also liked the male main character who was a ""what you see is what you get"", once you got to know him. The incidental characters and the other guests were also interesting and it was an easy read."
3,Nice writing but not very compelling.,"I thought the writing was very nice, but I didn't find the story very compelling.I couldn't figure out what period Hotel Du Lac was set in.I wasn't drawn to any of the characters, though I felt they were, for the most part, real characters.The main character was dull and not very likeable, but that may've been the point.I expected the main character's past to be more interesting. I was disappointed when I learned the reason she was in ""hiding"".But if you enjoy reading stories about a characters perception of people then you may enjoy it. All observing, no real movement.I congratulate the author on her award and for completing her work."
1,What was the Booker Prize Committee thinking?,"I looked forward to reading this novel and, having finished it, I can truly say that if Anita Brookner was trying to create an atmosphere of upper class ennui, then she surely accomplished her goal -- unfortunately, this reader was filled with ennui while reading it. I have no idea what competition this book faced to win the Booker Prize, but it must have been an abysmal year in British fiction. I can't imagine where the so-called ""wit"" of this novel was, and I couldn't have cared less about its shallow characters. BORING and turgid. I needed to take a shower when I was through with it -- blech."
2,A so-so book about a bourgeois writer.,"An english writer of romance novels takes an excursion to a Swiss Hotel in order to ""settle down"" after committing an unspeakably embarrassing act back home. The characters of the novel are the people she meets at the hotel. Much is said about clothing, manners, and other bourgeois topics. Each character, except for our mediating exiled main character, is essentially a flat character that promotes a certain way of life - one a free-lover, another a chronic shopper, etc. This book about ideas is mildly interesting, but fails to achieve a structural beauty which, in my mind, makes a great book"
5,A Subtle & Winsome Masterpiece,"Potential Readers Beware: This book is subtle, intelligent, witty, heartbreaking, arid, sensuous, eloquent and luminous. If you are looking for a rollicking, wham-bam-thank-you-maam plot, look elsewhere. Anita Brookner writes of the quiet and unnoticed desperation of women and men of a certain age. If you give yourself over to this book and this writer, the reward will be lasting."
4,A book that you can sink your teeth into,"Bring Doughnuts is not a literary classic, but compared to similar books of it's genre and a lot of the stuff that's turning heads today, its very good.As its jacket says, bring some extra tissues because you'll need them. Tears will be shed, but humor and the laughter it brings is what makes this book enjoyable.There are a lot of issues dealt within the 396 pages, but the theme for me was how one overcomes fears. Even the most confident person has moments of dispare, when they think they're not up to the challenge. This book delivers a feeling of victory and accomplishment. It questions convictions and examines beliefs.Its wholesome yet rank at the same time, but is a story that both yesterday and today's high schoolers would enjoy!"
4,A wonderful and powerful story,"Is there a place for you? If you think you can judge, can you be judged? Do you think a doubter can believe? If you fit into any of these categories, you have got to read this book.Its a story of a young high school senior guy, who's trying to be cool and earn a reputation. Somewhere between peer pressure, reaching for the brass ring, getting laid and dealing with God, the story's main character goes through a whirlwind of troubles, changes and successes.Its a fast moving, fun read that will keep you guessing and occasionally rooting for trouble.This is a great book for those who have had trouble believing in God, or for that matter, anything substantial. Its also a story of hope and conviction.Its a little on the steamy side and because of that I couldn't give it a five. But its a real strong four!"
4,Blue Belle's give Doughnuts fifteen thumbs up!,"Hello from Toronto, home of the Bluejays, Maple Leafs and the most beautiful city in North America!Our group of 15 has been reading and reviewing books for over a decade. We love to discuss what we got out of a book that we chose and how it left us feeling. I can honestly report that we have never gone through such a wide variety of emotions like we have after reading this book.We laughed, cried and occasionally broke into quite the sweat over some of the scenes that took place within this book.It may be one of the few books that our entire membership approved of, which made most of us chuckle because of some of the sex scenes.The consensus among our group, was how well this book dealt with almost every emotion that one could experience, and how questioning God doesn't mean that you turn from him.We highly recommend that you pick up this ""doughnut""!!!"
4,"Funny with a twist, its actually got a story","Books of this type of story line usually are just an elongated comedy sketch or some sort of venture into young adult porn. Thankfully, this book is loaded with some decent stories that make you think and reflect on issues of faith and common sense.Oh, you'll run into the sex and games, but they're actually funny to read as it deals with more than just the act, it deals with the mind games that accompany sex at the age of 18.I will admit that I had a difficult time putting the book down, especially after the first couple of chapters.Hope this guy tackles more of this school age transition period."
4,Lots o laughs and something to take away,"Got the book from my wife just before a business trip and didn't think too much of it until late one night. Too bad, because when I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Stayed up the entire night and didn't perform my best the following day. There's a lot of laughs that the author provides, in a sarcastic tone that really begs for more!Also, some stories that keep you gripped to the pages. This is an emotional roller coaster ride that might be one of the best books that I've read in a long, long time!"
3,The text book about getting ready for college and life,"This is an absolute gem of a story about how we all need to chill out about life and live it one day at a time. Every day brings new challenges and hope, and despite our best efforts to plan everything out, there's always a chance something will pop up to mess things up. How we handle changes determines our character.This is a fun book detailing events that just about everybody can relate to. The author, blends a variety of emotions together with just the right amout of humor to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.Interestingly enough, the author doesn't seem to have any prior credits? As an English Professor I usually like to stay within the frame work of proven writers. Fortunately, students sometimes direct the teacher and in this case, they struck gold!One side note, the publisher was a little sloppy in their detailing and editing of this book. Therefore; Content and story = A : Editing and final text product = D"
2,Stale Doughnuts,"When an author trys too hard for either laughs or over emotional responses from his readers, you usually get a book that lacks direction. This book falls into that catagory.I'll admit that it had some moments, but in general its a gringing book to read."
5,Doughnuts for all,"Its compelling! Its thought provoking! Its like the treat that it's named after, mouth watering!It quite simply is the literary rollercoaster ride of the year. There are more twist and turns than you can shake a stick at. The high's are high and the low's are just that. The jacket of the book says it all, you'll need tissues a pleanty from all of the laughing and crying that you'll do.It's a great book to get lost in, and not too bad to enjoy with a donut and a hot cup of coffee."
2,"Eat donuts and get fat, read donuts and drop IQ points","You know why books that are not published from major houses fail, because they were not any good from the start. Such is the case with this book.The writing is mediocre at best, the story is flat and the language is childish. I felt like I lost 25 IQ points just by opening this up.Let me save you some time, girl problems, blame somebody else. Social problems, blame everybody else. Problems with life, blame God. I have a better name for this book than it's title. It should have been called the Blame Game.Just read the first page, ""F"" this, ""F"" that and ""F"" God. Well Mr. Szekely, ""F"" you."
5,The perfect gift,"With graduation's approaching, this book should be given to the gratuate in your life. Don't by a Hallmark, rather slip the gift in the middle of this book and write a note to the kid to read the book, before you'll let him/her know where the gift is. Before they get to the money, hopefully they'll grasp what they're reading.The book is an inspirational trip through a high school senior year, loaded with laughs and some really wonderful lessons. Actually, this book should be given to each senior, at the begining of their final year!Take my advice and put your gift in one of these books. They'll never forget you!"
3,Yes and No,"This is a book that I'm having a hard time either endorsing or telling my friends not to read. I like the stories and the characters that make up the book, but the early attacks on God and the bugging of the confessional are big no-no's.The thing that makes me finally say yes, is that the book's main character makes his peace with God and gives the reader a great feeling.So, yes - no - and in the end, YES."
4,Entertaining reading,"It's not a book that'll win any awards, but it's one that will keep your interest and will entertain you.It does have this ability to tell many stories, while focusing on a general plot. I'll admit that the conversational tone of the book is quite good, but there are parts that will leave a bad taste in ones mouth, and even more that the book could have probably done without.In general however, it was entertaining."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I was hoping for a book that would zing me with inspiration! Really get my heart jumping. Instead it was dull and dry. If you are looking for a book to inspire you, to move you quickly and with joy toward opening to your creativity, this is not that book."
1,don't waist your money,"This print is of the poorest quality. The picture they show as a preview of what you're buying is 100 times better than the print that will show up at your door. If I had downloaded an image of this print from the internet and printed it out on an inkjet printer, it would have had better image quality. Don't waist your money."
3,"Missing ""The Aftermath""","This is a great work. Be aware, however, that this particular version of Churchill's The World Crisis does not include the final volume, entitled The Aftermath, which is an integral part of the original though published a bit later. I bought this book primarily to have a reading copy of the chapter regarding Ireland contained in The Aftermath and was disappointed to find that this is not contained in this particular version."
3,poetic banality stands upon a stepladder of history,"I eagerly snatched up a copy of this novel when I stumbled across it in a used book store. I had read other works by Kundera, and was impressed by novels such as _The Book of Laughter and Forgetting_, but somehow this one seemed an exercise in banality. The language is, as always, beautiful and well-crafted; the pace doesn't dawdle except in moments of poignancy or humor; yet I sat there knowing that I should be moved to sorrow or laughter and all I wanted to do was emit a derisive snort and go wash dishes. The book is too cutesy for me. The poet comes across more as a mentally-deficient kitten in a pet shop window than as a gently roasted sacred cow. While the inclusion of past poets of equally dysfunctional lives is a nice touch (equal opportunity poetic humanization?), this book is, for me, a one-shot: read and pass on."
5,OEM Product,"Have started using the Brother OEM cartridges due to ease of installation. Sometimes there is a problem with the knock offs being read by the machine which gives an ""empty cartridge"" message. The OEM are more apt to read by the machine."
1,Looks bogus!,"Don't believe the picture! This does NOT come in a Brother retail box, and the cartridges don't even have the Brother brand name on it. Looks like third-party ink, NOT BROTHER. Will be returning my order! :("
4,Brother for Brother!,"It's always best to purchase the appropriate printer ink for the printer, sometimes if you don't the warranty will be voided. This is the one."
1,Brother LC41M Magenta Ink Cartridge - Retail Packaging Sold by: FIGI CAPITAL LLC,Red ink had leaked out of the ink cartridge inside the sealed packaging on the first ink cartridge order. Amazon gave me a credit for that one. I placed another order for a replacement. It came today with the same problem.
3,interesting but frustrating,"The book covered the early life of Golda in a warm and interesting way. The following years in Israel are too domestic and obssessed with gossip, when there were such extraordinary and terrible events happening. Likewise the author comes to an abrupt end just when Golda is on the brink of most important part of her life."
3,it could have been better,"I'm pretty sad to see the way the album turned out to be, T-Bone definitly got skillz but this should have been alot better, He was biting alot from Snoop & E-40. there was only 2 really good tracks in this Album ""Blazin Mic's"" is lyricily insane and ""Gospel Alpha Mega...."" feat. Krs One is just a masterpiece. other then that well.... it's not worth the [$$] (sorry T-bone Fans)"
3,"Great rapper, okay CD.","I don't know, it just seems like T-Bone has so much talent, but he kind of keeps doing the same CDs with different titles. I know he added all that disco funk to this CD. But when it's all said and done, it's the same old T-Bone. It's an okay CD, but if you're looking for a really good T-Bone CD, get ""The Last Street Preacher"". ""Grammatical Revolution"" and ""Art of Translation"" by Grits are also good."
3,It's alright,This cd is pretty tight but I like 5 and 10 better then all of the other ones and for all of you that don't know his web site it's Http://www.houseoftbone.com/
1,very wack,"This CD is pretty bad. I think it is a waste of money. I bought it when i first started listening to christian music and getting away from secular music. Even then I was like what in the world is this? THe lyrics lack taste and is not representing jesus, god, or his word the way I thought it would. Its basically secular music that is cheap with no cuss words and a shout out here and there to god. Thats it!!"
1,Very disappointed,"I have been a T-Bone fan from way back although I have not bought or heard anything of his in the last 5 years or so. I took my wife to see the movie ""Fighting Temptations"" and T-Bone was featured and he did an awsome rap. It was so good that my wife liked it and she generlly can't stand rap. I quickly went out to purchase ""Gospel Boogie"" for my wife since she was high on the Bone. I listened to it on my way home and it was horrible! It was a lot of rap and little gospel. I heard his last CD was great so I will try it. This one however, had more of the world than I wanted.My last advice is to stay original. Don't reference so much of what secular artist do. Stick to God and let Him give you original ideas."
5,very good,"this cd has helped me like christianity even more even thogh its not as good as ""last street precha"" it still an extremely good cd."
2,Copy Cat,"T bone gives christian rappers a bad name by perpetuation the stereotype. He just copies everything from the mainstreem and changes every time they change. He didn't come out with this until Snoop dogg came out with Snoop Fizzle Televizzle with all the psychadelic colors and funky influeces. Bone, Get your own Identity! Be yourself."
4,"Read the First Edition. Good, but needed North POV","I read the first edition of this book (published 1979). This is an excellent introduction into the Vietnam War. The book does focus on the politics and policies of the United States rather than more palatable topics such as the human stories of the war. The book gives a firm background into the years preceding American involvment in Vietnam. The first edition needed the perspective of communist sources to make it a more well rounded work, but of course at the time that was near impossible. A good book for anyone interested in a general history of the Vietnam war."
3,Very imformative.,"This book was assigned reading for my ""International Conflict"" class. I started this book only because I had to, but I enjoyed it. I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the causes of the Vietnam war and why we fought for so long."
3,Academic,"This book was really good. It was the best college textbook I ever had (for an undergraduate history of the Vietnam War class). It was succinct, thorough, and insightful, and provided the back story all the way back to World War II, and gave a short but important and perceptive commentary on Vietnam's leaders' expectations and perceptions of the West, particularly the U.S., coming out of the second big one.So there's nothing bad to say about this book. It's great as what it is. It is not, however, the fast-moving, personal account of soldiering one could expect from Galloway or Halberstam. It is a great one, but it is a political science/foreign policy/international relations textbook nonetheless."
3,"Lots of Info, but not a great read.","In retrospect, I enjoyed this book more than some of the other books about Vietnam that I've read. At the time, however, I viewed it as fairly boring. It contains a lot of useful information presented in a readable format. On the downside, it also contains a lot of policy and politics, which is not a subject of great interest to myself. It would prove to be an excellent source of information for any formal research paper or project, etc. All in all, a good book, but not very exciting."
2,returned it,"The song listing on the website when I purchased it was different from the actual songs, which I did not care much for."
1,Gibberish,"A load of juvenile nonsense, collected from magazines, assembled by a fantasist who knows virtually nothing about the subject. If you want to read a work of fiction, feel free to enjoy the experience."
2,KGB alpha,"I was dissapointed by this book, trully it is telling you how to run ove stuff, how to go prone, how to stab someone (duhhhh, could it be just push the knife in someones chest). I thik if you really want good fighting stuff there are better things around. Check out Master of the Blade, excellent book. Also check out some other stuff by that author, a really smart guy, not a fighter not a writer."
4,a great book of cryptograms...printed on good paper.,"I am an huge cryptogram fan. This book is great. The only nitpick I have is that the answers are printed one after the other, so you might wind up seeing the next quote if you go to check your answer. I love the spiral binding, and the fact that it is printed on thick white paper. I'm usually frustrated with cryptogram books because the paper is cheap and tears when you inevitably have to erase."
4,It is what I wanted,This book is what I was looking for. Too many cryptograms book have 'too small type font' and are impossible to do. This one is good :)
5,Great word fun!,"I'm very pleased. The cryptograms often are quite challenging but one can use one, two or three clues for help if needed.I removed the answers and keep them apart from the book to make it much more difficult to peek. The loose leaf feature makes it easy to keep the pages open flat."
4,Generally Good Fun,"This is a nice collection of cryptograms, mostly ""quote-type"". It has a few nice features: it is spiral-bound and has ""hints"" to help if you get stuck. Some of the letter substitutions, hints and styles become a bit too familiar (and easy). But this book is great to relax and enjoy a moderate challenge."
4,Lots of not-so-hard cryptograms,"I haven't done a cryptogram in years, since our local newspaper dropped the daily cryptoquote. Even with my lack of skill, I still find this cryptograms in this book to be quite easy. Like, beginner level. That said, I'm enjoying them, but I will hope to find a more challenging book in the future.There are ""hints"" in this book--which I seriously doubt anyone would need, and which I promptly tore out and threw away--368 cryptograms, with solutions in the back.Great way to start these fun puzzles, but not a book for someone wanting a challenge."
3,LIGHT TONING FOR THE ARMS,"""This DVD is recommended for beginners because there are not may reps or sets, slower paced, lightweights are used throughout and there are many options and modifications. I'll say this much, the set is really nice and Leisa is backed up by two well-coiffed smiling ladies. Leisa offers a lot of equipment one can use, such as...pillows! for chest work, if you don't have a step nor a bench. But, you need a chair because there are routines where she works from sitting on a no-arm chair. Yoga is an option on the menu, 10 minutes of a couple of rounds of the sun salutation using the band during warrior positions. It's a less serious and easy-going yoga segment. Again, this DVD is definitely for beginners or for people who want a less intense workout for your arms."""
2,Too fast paced...,"I didn't really care for this video. I felt like we were jerking around too much. The movements were not very fluid and there weren't enough repetitions to feel comfortable. She also changes positions rapidly (we're on the chair, we're off the chair, now the floor, now a bench, and back to the chair again). Most of my workout was repeatedly rearranging the living room! Also, the assistants in the background were a little too perky and fakey for me. I'm going to stick with Pilates."
3,Recommend for beginners,"This video is nice, but I think it's definitely more for beginners than more advanced exercisers. It's low impact and slow paced, but it does have decent exercises and I really enjoy Leisa Hart as an instructor."
2,Not a big fan,I wasnt happy with this. Only cause I expected more. If you are looking for basic easy go with this. If you are looking for more intense and better go with Jari Love: Get Ripped & Chiseled and SWAT Workout: Ultimate Body Definition...those are way great!
1,Do not buy Panasonic,"Do not buy Panasonic cameras. I bought a DMC-LC20 one year ago, and it died exactly one day after the warranty expired. It began taking pictures with green/pink tones. Support for digital cameras is terrible. They replaced the main board with a second hand one as a ""favor"" without improvement, now (6 weeks later) they still have the camera and now want to replace the CCD for $129.00 + labor. Panasonic has not returned any emails I've sent about my disappointment with this product. I will throw it away and buy Sony."
5,Excellent!,"Originally, we planed to buy Sony P9. However, when we tried both of them at Fry's, we knew that Lumix LC40S is exactly what we want! We have been using it for couple months, its performance is amazing! It can also take movies! Two of my colleague had just bought the same model as mine. They both feel happy with this product!"
2,ahem?,"This a female five piece, although some members look like guys. Obviously they have went back and listened to the first Siouxsie record. Why they did this I am not so sure. ""Shotgun"" sounds more like Altered Images ""Dead Pop Stars"" than the Banshees (remember that Altered Images started out as a Siouxsie thing too). There are a bunch of new wave and early goth sounds throughout. There's a lot of hostility for ""a rich white man"" and the fact that ""my daddy doesn't love me."" Most of the other lyrics are vague and suggest lesbianism. Every with all that against them, Radio Vago seem pretty good. Who knows what they are trying to achieve or if they can pull it off live. They remind me of some of those strange bands in the early LA punk Scene like The Bags and Catholic Discipline.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"
4,Interesting true story of one womans determination.,Although Grace Moore's true story is much more interesting than this movie the music alone would make me rent or buy this film. Grace was born in a small valley in the hills of Tennessee and became one of the most famous women in her time. It's too bad Columbia doesn't release all her films on video so that people can see and hear this true talent. This movie is famous for being the only film that had Merv Griffen as a romantic lead and featured the first open mouthed kiss on film (according to Griffen). There is also a great dance sequence in this film. Grace Moore was voted one of the 10 most beautiful women by Flo Zeigfeld and the lovely Kathryn Grayson does a superb job of showing Grace's beauty and determination at a time when women were not truly valued. I bought this movie and even gave one to a friend that loves musicals.
4,A showcase for Grayson's talent!,"So this is Love, which depicts the early career of Grace Moore, gives Kathryn Grayson an opportuity to demonstrate her skills for all types of music: arias, classics, showtunes, and popular. Her stunning beauty, glorious voice, and captivating charm in this and her many other films clearly established her as the reigning diva of Hollywoood's golden era. However, the script, as in most or Grayson's other movies, does not give her much of a chance to to use her considerable acting skills which she displayed with great success in her later TV, theater, and operatic performances. Overall, I give this film 4 stars but Grayson rates 5 stars! Putting this film on DVD was long overdue!"
3,Get Grace Moore's movies instead!!!!,"I guess if you're a Grayson fan this movie is pretty good. But I can't stand her quavery voice. If you really want to know about Grace Moore, get HER movies....When You're in Love (with Cary Grant), New Moon with Tibbett, and The King Steps Out. I have all of them and I consider these 3 the best. There are clips from these on Youtube.Moore spent 8 years on broadway before opera. Her 'Minnie the Moocher' version shows her incredible ability with both genres."
2,this is as condensed as it gets,I was looking for a book that would give me some good insights into the world in St. Thomas. This one goes to the extreme. It was unusual to even have a listing let alone actual information that helped me make a decision. The intro with general info about ATM/cell phones etc was helpful
1,Known problem as reviewed above,"Again, as post indicated above, standard cable is fuzzy and looks like there is some sort of compression going on. Not a clear picture like the other televisions. did extensive troubleshooting, Samsung admits fault and now has a new model, replacing this one..boy i wonder why! Those reading this, get the txn-3275hf which fixes this."
2,This Model outdated in less than a year.,"The Samsung Monitor has performed well over the past year. To be fair I haven't had any problems. However, like most electronic equipment it is now outdated. For an extra 50 bucks you can buy one with a built in HDTV tuner. The store where I bought this model doesn't even carry it anymore, and it hasn't been a year. Also, when you start pricing HDTV tuners, OTA or other be prepared to pay $300-$400. This Model is now outdated."
5,Aldo Nova,"I have always loved good eighties rock music. This compliments my collection like none other. Knowing I can get the ""old"" stuff on cd is fantastic."
4,Clasic Album,Aldo Nova's self titled debute album starts out with Aldo's big hit Fantasy. The keyboards and hellcopter are followed by the lazer beam like sounds just before the music takes off in a direction that instantly gets you excited and moving. The rest of the album is a mixture of good mid-tempo rock songs as ell as a couple of great ballads.It keeps you rocking and moving from start to finish. This is how an album should be done.
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty disappointed with this album. The guy is undoubtedly a killer guitarist but, why oh why, didn't he hire a lyricist? A parodist couldn't come up with lamer lyrics if he/she tried. As it is, the only song that really stands out is 'Fantasy' and I suspect that the only reason it stands out, for me, is that it brings back pleasant memories and associations. If you are a fan of solid, if somewhat cliched, guitar playing buy this album, listen to it a couple of times, and move on.

5,The Ultimate Country Fake Book: C Instruments (Fake Books),Awesome book use it at least 3 times a week for 2-3 hour practices. Best investment I have ever made thanks Jamses
5,"Like the stars say ""I love it""","This is a true-ly delightful book, chockfull of engaging stories and deeper insight into a type of shamanism not really well known or at least, lost to most of us.This books gets so deep into the personal story of Simon becoming a bee-(sha)man that you can almost get under his skin, almost, because what he's telling us is way to far from our daily lives to even remotely touch. But still, he wants us make belief this is possible and for some moments, your really start believing that.I can say this book is a must-read for all people interested in shamanism from far or nearby :)."
2,Not believable,"A young woman recommended this book to me as I am interested in keeping bees. She said I Must read it. Well, I wish I had my money back as I am 72 and didn't appreciate the magical aspect of the author's adventures. I didn't finish the book due to the unbelievable experience the author relates about his being with the bees. I wish I could relate more of the story, but the book is not with me and I can't fully quote what I found objectionable. Don't waste your money!,"
4,Reading This Book Was a Journey,"Regardless of whether this work is accepted as fact, it is a very poetic and beautifully written rendition of the author's journey through his discovery of Shamanic Beekeeping. It is a recount of experiences, dreams, friendships and a way of life that has long been forgotten by most people. This book is NOT an instructional manual and if it is read for any other reason than enjoying a man's story of discovery, then it is not for you. I really enjoyed this book."
2,Forget this stand and buy the T4B,"When I purchased this stand the T4B stand was not available. I have used the table saw stand similar to the T4B for several years and love it. I even get comments from friends about how nice that it is.For storage purposes, the T3B is ridiculous. I have the Bosch 10"" Miter Saw and you could not set the stand upright easily without it falling over. The T4B does not have that problem and the saw is very balanced on it.You will regret not spending the extra to buy the T4B in the long run.Bosch T4B Gravity-Rise Miter Saw Stand"
4,nice stand - very bad instructions,I like the stand - it supports my saw nicely. But setting it up was a bear. The directions are very badly written. I don't think the person that wrote them ever tried to put one of these together. Just use your common sense and you will get through it. Over all I think the stand is very nice to have and I would buy it again. It really helps out on the job site. Also it is a little on the heavy side but one man can carry it if needed.
2,Assembly is PAINFUL,"Rating only for Assembly. Purchased stand even after reading other reviews. Have just finished putting together. The other reviews are correct. Lots of pieces and instructions are terrible. Only provided a black and white copy of original Instructions. Hard to see pictures, poorly written, and difficult to follow. With that and some guessing, you will eventually get it together. Several times had to undo and restart some of the steps. Shouldn't be this painful. Bosch needs to start over with the Instructions. Agree with others that would have been helpful to assemble more of it at plant but I am sure Bosch picked cheapest packaging option -- as evidenced by the Instructions.Haven't used yet. Stand appears to be sturdy. But the trade off is the stand and the Bosch saw together will be heavy -- right at 120 pounds (75 lbs for saw + 44 lbs stand). Something to consider if ever have to pick up both pieces at once.Amazon ordering and delivery time (standard)was exceptional."
2,not worth the money or the effort - even if you're lazy or new,"I am both lazy and new to woodworking, and I'm already planning on replacing this thing. I am a big fan of Bosch stuff - it typically just has a neat feel to it that lets you know they put a lot of thought into the usability of their products.In this case, as other readers have mentioned, this thing was a pain in the neck to put together. In the end it is flimsy and the adjustments lack the ingenuity and refinement I expect from Bosch. You are without a doubt better off throwing something together with a sturdy base and cleverly configured stops.If you really need something like this for portability (outdoors or on-site), you might be better off with a sturdier multi-purpose stand and repeatable cutting jig. This thing just does not make the grade."
4,great stand,"i don't know what everyone else is complaining about, but you have to be retarded if you can't easily put this stand together. my only complaint is the extension arms are not quite long enough, I need to get the second extension kit. and when i got it both of the cheasy plastic parts on the extension arms (which are riveted on) were broken but a quick phone call to trac rac and they quickly sent new ones."
2,Bosch Miter saw stand,"Made in China. Poor design, Bosch saw cuts in manufacturing costs and quality...... All in all performs satisfactory.."
3,Wheels fell off!,"After using the stand about three times, I was rolling it down a sidewalk and all a sudden it stops. I look on the ground and one of the wheels was rolling down the street. Cheap little plastic caps like the ones you put on BBQ/Weber wheels fell off. Contacted Bosch, will update what they do..."
2,Bad for the U. S.,"Whatever the content of the book, the title agrees with my assertions in my book In the Presence of Our Enemies in which I cover the origins of the Unholy Three, basically created by Harry Dexter White, Soviet agent planted in the U.S. Treasury and John Maynard Keynes, neither of whom had the welfare of the U.S. on their minds at Bretton Woods. Their only differences appeared to be how much gold to leech out of the U.S. to start the agency, $5 billion or $25 billion! These agencies operate without restriction, the employees ride high wide and handsome, travelling at whim in a manner no U.S. employee would be free to do, while the record shows 70% of the projects undertaken end in failure. (ASIN Ellen McClay, In the Presence of Our Enemies)"
2,I Was Rooting for the Cult!,"I love horror novels about demons and devils, but not just any story will do. This one doesn't. The two reviewers before me aren't exaggerating about the ""he was a cop"" thing. Maybe Schmidt should have titled it as such.I don't like animals being hurt or killed, even in stories, but even that didn't make me hate this cult more than the main character. However, the cult was corny! They chanted the usual stuff, and all the Satanic and evil symbols were thrown around haphazardly. Black circles, inverted pentagrams and crosses, black candles, and body parts are just put together without rhyme or reason. And I never exactly understood the bald-headed leader with the black eyes; was he human, possessed, or what?This story might have been better had the main character drank himself to death in the very beginning and let someone else be the main character."
1,"ughh, what is this?","When people whine and moan about In Flames new stuff, this song instantly comes to mind.Not only does it sound popish, with keyboards and whatnots, but it is absolutely unlike anything In Flames have done. People who like Taproot and other *hitty bands will like this garbage, while fans of melodeath should check out Lunar Strain, Jester Race, or even the new album Come Clarity."
5,Wonderful book for southern gardens.,"This was a great book, full of information specifically geared toward the south. It was great to see a book full of roses that can thrive in the southern climate. Though I am a beginner at gardening, and especially antique rose gardening, I felt there was lots of information here for the experienced gardener as well. This book has been a great reference tool, as well as one that is a joy to just look at."
2,should be titled Antique Roses for South Texas,I thought the book would address more than the South Texas Area. Rather misleading title- It is difficult to find information on roses that do well in zones 6-9.Too many pages devoted to flower arranging and potpourri making.
3,An Enjoyable Book on Roses.....,"I do like this book on roses very much; however, Dr. Welch gave way too much attention along with way too many pages to the subjects of arranging roses and rose potpourri. When I saw this was the new edition, I hoped it did not include these two subjects and instead give us more pictures and information on additional roses. Sadly, it does not. Other than arranging roses and making potpourri, the roses and information in this book are excellent, a most very enjoyable read."
5,Very good book,"Very good book. Examined it at the library, checked it out twice and liked it so much I decided to buy it. Plenty of practical advice regarding roses and helping them grow in the unique climate of the South."
4,Good stuff!,"I learned about proboost from my fibromyalgia doctor. She prescribed it to boost my flagging immune system. It works, and I haven't noticed any side effects from it. Now I take it whenever I have a virus that I can't shake. It always helps to dry secretions and shake an infection. Its a powder you take under the tongue, because stomach acids destroy it. It has a pleasant, sweetish taste, and its not a problem to take it that way, except that you can't talk while you've got it in your mouth. The only negative I have is the expense. I rate it at 4 star for the expense, not for the product itself, which is great. Try it!"
1,What a lot of garbage.,At 4$ this is a ripp off.The recording must have been made from a tape of an old scratchy record played on one off those old wind up record players with that big horn thing sticking out.It is absolutely terrible. I want my money back. The package it comes in aint too bad tho. You can use the disc as a coaster and the case for some other disc.Absolute GARBAGE. Makes Justin Trowser snake and the Back Street Bonkers sound almost worth listening to. Take note Cranster me owld mate.
4,Great Stuff for the WW2 Msuic Buff,"The music from England is often overlooked by many Yank WW2 Music aficiandos (with a few major exceptions, like Vera Lynn) but some of the tunes on this CD are really worth a listen-to.I've actually downloaded some of them in Amazon MP3 versions for my MP3 player to run/walk to...the rhythm is perfect! ""Ive Got My Eyes On You"" is a great example of this!Very fun!"
3,"Mind Boosters bt R /Sahelian, MD","I find the book quite informative but was very disappointed to find it was and old book0 copyrite 2000!! I wanted a book that was much more up to date as I have memory difficulties needing the best of help.R C Nickeson, Ph.d. retired psychology prof."
1,Hated this movie,"I hated this movie. Nothing else to be said. However...I LOVED the fake five star reviews!!!! Well written, exciting, and most of all CONVINCING!! Keep up the good work."
2,The Good Soldier,I found the movie to be very boring. I ended up shutting it off and taking it at wasted money.
1,Ugh...,"This movie had to have been the absolute worst I had seen in many years. The script was juvenile, the acting dismal, and the scenery cheap. Surely the budget for this movie was less than $1000 including paying the actors and extras."
3,Forever Lost,"America lost its sense of humor that it was about 90 percent Klan members in the 1930s. Then came the black and women's movement. This deals with the white racial aspect of the KKK, not its progress since the 1860s. It is o.k."
3,Like the picture and size hate the noise...,"Purchased the TV last month for the size and picture.The Good: The picture is great in normal and HDTV mode and the size is awesome for me.The Problems: A louder than average whining noise emanates from the TV, it flat out makes makes a racket. At low volumes under 10 you can hear it through programs which is very annoying. Samsungs customer service regarding this matter to date is non-existent.Also, the salesman (At Best Buy) swore this TV didn't shut itself off with an energy saver, unlike the 30'Whdtv Phillips. Wrong, this TV does shutoff, timer or not, at inexplicable intervals the manual makes zero reference to the energy saving workings.Overall very mixed about this TV."
1,Forgive me Sony,"The other reviewers may have defective TV's because mine doesn't shut off inexplicably; However, it does have curved side bars when viewing in 4:3 aspect ratio (this is not corrected/affected by the tilt adjustment). Also, the left side of my screen is brighter than the right. I have a call in for repair of these problems.What cannot be repaired is the poor design, no doubt to keep the cost relatively low: 1. no rear S-Video jack (just one in the side panel). 2. not magnetically shielded (my receiver on the shelf above was turning the top of the picture green). 3. seperate buttons on remote for vid1/vid2/s-vid/ant & component1/2/vid1/2. 4. no dvi input. 5. no picture-in-picture.I was going to get the Sony KV-30HS510 but thought I'd save some money with the Samsung; Forgive me Sony, you are clearly worth the extra $500. (which is just 13 cents a day over ten years, which is how long my last Sony lasted) Would've been well worth it considering the stress I'm going through now."
5,T-Rex is T-riffic,"Super cool music from a classic British Shaman. Don't be fooled by the ""Glam Rock"" stamp placed on it.You can't go wrong with Gibson guitars and a Marshall Amp."
5,Bolan Still Boogies,"At last, a well thought out American release of the Cosmic Boppers Bolanic Beat.From Debora to I love to Boogie,23 tracks that will get those toes tapping and make you smile.Bolan definately was Stolen.Five Stars to Dan Hersh who did an amazing remastering job.,the early tracks Rumbling Spires , Elemental Childe,Magical Moon,Swan,Jewel,Beltane Walk and the sublime Raw Ramp never sounded better.(Can someone PLEASE remaster the Brown Album 1970)in fact its all a joy to hear.The packaging is top notch.A fitting tribute to Marc Bolan, who gave us so much in his short time here on earth.I LOVE it !!"
3,The Ultimate Collection? I think not...,"If you're simply unwilling to spend the money on several CDs by all means buy this CD. If you want to really get a feel for T. REX, this isn't going to do it for you. So many of their GOOD songs are missing on this album, rather, they have less than inferior songs from the earlier Tyrannosauraus Rex period--> to me it's a perfectly horrific waste. If you want to hear some excellent T. Rex songs I'd reccommend ""Ballrooms of Mars,"" ""Mambo Sun,"" ""Planet Queen,"" ""Truck On (Tyke),"" ""Life's A Gas,"" ""Girl,"" ""Monolith,"" ""Lean Woman Blues"" and ""Rock On."" They had so many wonderful QUALITY songs, and it's such a shame they weren't included on this album. If you're just now discovering T. Rex, I'd start with Electric Warrior, it's absolutely amazing and worth every penny."
2,this ain't the best,"this is not the best of set i had been waiting for ,.give me more rockers..wheres baby strange?the first ten songs are soooooo wimpy.Theres a better two disc import out there so buy that instead."
2,Not Bad,"A. Parvar, now it's my turn to have a say. I find your own views not worthy of listening to. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, deal with it! It's not down to you to tell us what the true meaning of life is, and I for one won't take a thing you say seriosuly after that little outburst. Some of T.Rex's songs were okay, but not enough for me to buy this. In short, I'd rather take Britney Spears Greatest Hit's over this, T.Rex are vastly over-rated."
3,"This is NOT a widescreen TV, but a value at 4:3 HD","I wanted a widescreen (16:9) HD 27 inch tube TV. A search for ""widescreen HD 27 HDTV"" on Amazon gave me this one, and the specs and price looked good. The photo looks sort of widescreen. IT IS NOT! This is a normal 4:3 TV, not the newer 16:9 widescreen format.If you want a 4:3 screen, then this HD-capable TV is a true value. The soft-touch buttons on the front are classy, although scrolling through the screen inputs is a bit tedious. It has two component HD inputs, and four yellow composite video inputs, but only one s-video input, and that is on the side panel. Strange. And when you plug in a yellow composite video source into the side, it overrides one of the rear inputs.I am exchanging this for the 26"" Samsung 2670WHF widescreen HD-capable TV that actually has a widescreen."
1,Piece of Junk...Regret getting stuck with this oversized paperweight!,"First problem was right before the warranty expired, fortunately. The ol' ""touch buttons on-the-front self-scrolling"" problem. Warranty service took 2 weeks to fix it. Now, the d#@% thing shuts off by itself, & won't turn back on. I'm still debating whether to fix it or junk it. I paid $700 new, back in '03 from Best Buy. It was my ""Worst Buy""."
4,Nice tool...,I bought this tool to adjust my 1993 Ford Tempo's headlights and was hoping it would fit my Chevy truck also. The truck is actually a 5mm. I found sockets to fit both vehicles while trying to help a friend work on his car. I will use the adjustment tool when I replace my car's lights. I think it will be easier than using a ratchet.
1,Imposible to buy,"I'm writing my thesis about Zoe Valdes... but I do not understand WHY I CAN NOT HAVE THIS DOCUMENT is only a HTML version and I don't see any logical reason for having geographical restrictions. I live in Mexico and have a VERY HARD time looking for books and papers and when I find them I CAN NOT BUY THEM!!!""We could not process your order because of geographical restrictions on the product which you were attempting to purchase. Please refer to the terms of use for this product to determine the geographical restrictions."""
3,idiosyncratic,"The idea behind this book is that a beginning graduate student can do approximate electronic structure calculations, solving nothing more than the quadratic equation, with the approximations provided. The approximate models are said to aid understanding and train intuition. It's a nice idea, but given the easy accessibility to electronic structure codes and powerful computers these days, it's antiquated: ones first approach would instead be to calculate! Worse, the pedagogical style in the book is such that it doesn't really train intuition either. I spent a lot of time trying to understand this book and I can't say that my effort was rewarded. Positive features: scope, historical interest, and low price from Dover."
4,Jewels of Wisdom and Perspective,"This book is not an easy read, but it is an interesting and worthwhile read. The chapter on why Dr. Schweitzer chose to be a medical missionary to Africa is especially interesting and meaningful. His thoughts on ""Reverence For Life"" are interesting and worthwhile reading, most provacative. His wide array of talent, abiltiy and interests are amazing and especially interesting, almost beyond belief and comprehension. His experiences as prisoner of war are revealing and somewhat shocking. At times the book gets tedious, especially in his philosophical thought,but don't let that stop you for slow you down. This book is well worth the read.Do men like Albert Schweitzer exist anymore? Could or would our culture let them exist?"
4,Another album from the Swamp Fox,"Rebellious Tony Joe sang on Beginning, ""I didn't come here for just one song"". He's stayed true to his word these last 30 odd years.There's a few familiar riffs on Snakey and he sounds a little older but it doesn't take anything away from this album.The music ranges from his classic bluesy swamp pop guitar and harmonica to an almost classical sounding spanish guitar number.His style of straight forward story telling and uncluttered lyrics filled with quirky humour hasn't changed. There's nothing new on this album but it doesn't sound stale or dated. Who said more of the same is a bad thing? It's all good!I don't think Tony Joe will win any new fans with this album but speaking as an existing fan, I loved it."
1,Swamp Fox,"Oh dear...the Swamp Fox sounds more like The Graveyard Cat on this album. Tracks are definately not up to previous standards like Cool Town Woman, Stockhome Blues, etc, etc"
1,Samsung toner,This toner was supposed to be new and original from Samsung. It doesn't look new and it doesn't look original. The toner was inside an open bag. When I took the toner out of the bag my hands got dirty from ink powder. It looks to me that this toner is not new but refurbish. It is working and I really do not want to go through hazard of returning it.I will probably never buy from this seller again. I feel that I paid 100 dollars for a toner that should have cost a lot less.
4,A Good Album,"A good album. On Heavy and Quite Often are my favorite songs. Dabbs has got a great voice, and the production does a good job of matching his sincerity and tenderness on many of the songs."
4,Pillow for peircing,"I got cartilage piercings on both ears and I can't sleep on them until they heal. I purchased this so I could have a hole for my ear to go in. It's not the most comfortable pillow, but it's comfy enough and does the trick."
1,AWFUL,Just another book to perpetuate the myth that humans are somehow more important than animals. Good book if you're ignorant.
1,Absolute rubbish,"Another very poor attempt at specieist literature. Shame on Routledge. If you want a good and honest read, try Peter Singer's 'Animal Liberation'."
1,Badly written and poorly researched,Incoherent ramblings. I didn't learn anything other than those whose lives depend on animal slavery will do anything to protect their vested interests.
1,Can't I rate it zero stars?,"I can only find one point for this book and that is so the ignorant people have someone to relate to. No where in the author's incoherent ramblings did I find anything that even resembled a reasonable excuse for the mindless animal torturing to continue. This book, in my opinion is poorly reasearched and little is explained. I think it was a waste of time and money."
1,"Written from a one-point perspective, a rip off for $30","The worst book ever! Don't waste your time or money reading this poorly researched and poorly written piece of (you know). Main points that to the non-reader should be obviously discussed in detail are not even written about at all. Doesn't explain why we should continue to murder and torture animals, doesn't explain how the human race will still be here in 50-100 years because of the enviornmental effects of eating meat, etc. Bottom line THERE WAS NO ONE TO ARGUE HER POINTS! IF THERE WERE, SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY."
1,Semantics,The purpose of this book is to use semantic tricks in order to attempt to justify needless institutionalized violence against non-human animals.
2,to much showoff....,"I agree that this dvd is overrated.. I think it fuels Kihara's huge ego, the info in the dvd is very basic and it really just showcases her and how cool she is. It is well known that Kihara has 3 serious back injuries- hernias from her dancing during and after she filmed the dvd, so it just doesn't make sense to me that she talks so much about the proper way of doing a movement. Asharah, Brice, Jake's dvd are a serious dance tool if you want to learn and take your dancing to the next level"
3,Short Workout,"Sharon Kihara is a lovely, talented dancer with great visual presentation, but this DVD falls short when it comes to instruction or practice. The whole thing is only an hour and fifteen minutes, and much of that is spent on the combination. As far as the isolations go, Kihara is content to do as little as two repetions of each movement (as with the shoulder rolls, for example.) In contrast, the DVDs released by Ariellah and Asharah give us very thorough drills. Your arms will be falling off by the end of their shoulder sequences, if you can even get through them. I recommend renting or borrowing this DVD before you buy. It might be just your thing, for the long combination sequence. But if you're looking to practice your isolations, this one won't do it."
4,Seems as if,It seems as if all of the tribal fusion DVDs have different things that are good about them. You don't really know what you're going to get until you buy it. This one is the shoulder shimmies. I haven't seen another video that shows how much attitude you can create just with those two humps on either side of your neck. She also shows you snake arms very well. You see a front and back view at the same time. Which helps show you jsut which muscles on your back should be moving. Her stretch routine includes the splits which I can't do so I was just standing around for that part. It also seems as if locking the movements into place was easier in watching this DVD. She makes the movement before the lock obvious so you can see what your muscles should be doing.
4,Tribal Fusion Bellydance with Sharon Kihara,"This is a great DVD for those entering the tribal fusion bellydance genre.The drills are a great way to learn the moves as well as being a good workout on their own. The choreography is easy to learn as it is broken down into combinations. Parts of it are a challenge but with repetition they are managable. Sharon's beautiful performance of the choreography demonstrates what can be achieved with discipline and passion.This DVD does not go over and over the moves like some others but if you use the reverse button on your remote, you can repeat them as often as you like.I'm glad I bought it and have been using the abs workout to improve my core strength."
4,Eye-blistering background. Good teacher.,"This is a very detailed, good bellydance DVD. It doesn't teach anything new, but is pleasant and will teach you a fair amount of bellydance technique. But, the background against which this is shot is an eye-blistering orange. I couldn't stand to watch it. Just be warned."
5,Great addition to my library,"Having already amassed a collection of belly dance DVDs, I was a little worried that this video would just recap things I had already seen or learned. In fact, one will recognize a lot of exercises from Suhalia's and Rachel's films, but this video takes some of the best bits and fits them altogether for a challenging, but not overwhelming workout, one that works out the whole body, but is easily broken down when you just wanna work, say, your torso. Furthermore, Sharon places more emphasis on the using the back and shoulder muscles, and gives a few new (to me, at least) techniques for 'pop' moves. I would recommend this with the first Rachel Brice video (the practice companion, I haven't seen the new one yet), then try out Suhalia's buns workout (very, very challenging.) Kudos to Sharon for making sure to demonstrate moves from multiple angles so we can see the weird muscle contractions."
1,Not very useful,"If you don't expect much out of this tripod, it might work for you. The head basically doesn't allow for any positioning of the camera. I bought it for a small camera, and it works all right, but the mount on my Canon S100 is on the side, so it has trouble balancing the camera. Since I can't really point the camera on the tripod, it's useless for macro work. I'm actually not sure when I'll use this.For the price, it might be worth it, but I would suggest you go with a real tripod (even a small one), you'll be much happier."
3,Nice,"These are nice sheets but not the best I have had nor the worst. They are soft textured almost like a not so flannel, flannel sheet. Not exactly the best fitting sheets I have ever bought. They were not expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. I figured three stars was a fair grade."
2,Beware,"My problem is not with the music, but with the discs. As with many other Teldec, Erato, and Warner Bros. Classic discs, all discs in the box will not play through my recently purchased Dell laptop. The issue seems to be, after searching for answers on the internet, anti-piracy software that Warner Bros. puts on its discs. Many others have had the problem, so beware."
1,not scarce,"""premium price due to scarcity"" ?????This color is still in production by MAC, has not been discontinued and can easily be bought from MAC, the MACcosmetics internet site or dept. stores with a MAC counter for the regular $14 price."
1,Super Dry Lipstick:(,"I 've already purchased and worn this lipstick and it is very, very dry! The color is attractive and it did stay on my lips, but it sucked the life out of my lips as well. I guess that's the problem with most matte lipsticks; they are oh, so dry! Actually I had to mix another regular lipstick color with this Ruby Woo just to have a drop of moisture on my lips during the day. Also when I smiled, it seemed like I could feel this thick dry lipstick crack on my lips. At days end, it was very difficult to wash off. In all, this lipstick was just too overbearing. Lipstick shouldn't constantly remind the person wearing it that they're actually wearing it. I want to forget that I'm wearing it, except when a passerby says ""I love your lipstick"".GIGOLO For Lips: FAIR PINKY BROWN CHAP-LIPSTICK NO SHINE PLUMPER WITH MIRROR, SPF20!"
1,Incorrect Description,Description states that this unit is powered via cigarette lighter. This is not true. The unit needs to be connected directly to the fuse box (professional installation).
5,leica?,"excelent hide option, no difference with leica digital cam but big saving, compair them, both offer the same things except for the brand."
3,"Better than the alternative brands, but still not great","This works OK... the finish isn't an exact match, but it looks pretty good. Fits pretty well, but again - not perfect.Problem is removing it. Once it's in, it's in. To take it out, you basically have to break it. I've had mine out 2-3 times, and it no longer stays where it's supposed to. So I've ordered another one to replace it."
1,Horrible,There have been a couple acoustic versions of Fall Out Boy songs I've absolutely LOVED! And I love pretty much every song by Fall Out Boy EVER.This **** isn't by Fall Out Boy and just makes your ears bleed. Don't even bother.
5,Everything and the Kitchen Sink: Remodel Your Kitchen...,A great read! I didn't think it was possible for a book on this topic to be so entertaining! Need to remodel your kitchen? Don't start without first reading this book! Manning and Costa have set the standard for this type of book. I'm hoping their next book is about remodeling bathrooms!
2,"Cutesy, yet shallow","In terms of the content of its advice, other books offer better coverage of design and materials options.If you are an absolute beginner who enjoys being condescended to, look no further! _Everything and the Kitchen Sink_ is written like the ""for dummies"" books, on the assumption that its semi-literate readers cannot struggle through a few normal paragraphs without labored jokes, needless bullet points, and broken-out ""tips."" Or it may just be that the graphic designer was struggling to stretch a skimpy text to book length -- there's lots of extra line spacing and huge subheads.I'm looking through it again, trying to find something nice to say ... well, it has a few nice photos ... and I come across page 69 on the ""impact of color."" According to these authors white inspires purity and hope, while gray can decrease hunger and yellow ""is said to help with digestion."" Yep. If you find that persuasive, this is the book for you."
4,"Good book for beginners, or for the chronically confused :)","I am finding this book to be useful, and easy to read. It is written in an entertaining style and is full of great tips and ideas. There are a number of photos that are of lower quality than I would have expected (page 18 - nothing in focus, page 104 low quality jpeg with pixelation, page 107 - out of focus, page 138 - blown up too large and lost resolution, page 163 out of focus). Those few photos, while annoying (and these problems were NOT artistic) do not detract from the value of the content. This is a really good and useful book. The photos could easily be replaced with better quality pictures in later editions. I do recommend this book for beginning to plan your kitchen remodel."
4,kitchen remodeling book,"This book was informative and fun to read. However, the authors assume you live in a place with kitchen designers and big box stores. There is no altenative advice if you do not live in such a place (at least a 2 hour drive for me)."
2,Try something else,I wasn't impressed with this book. It is somewhat outdated and the content leaves a lot to be desired. Try another title.
2,More of a design and idea book,If your looking for a how to book on remodeling your kitchen this is not it. This is more of a book from a idea and design standpoint for remodeling.
2,Not much substance and not fun to read,"I read this book quickly and probably won't use it again before we remodel the kitchen. This is the fifth book I've read on kitchens and I purchased this one based on the reviews here. Like another reviewer said, this book is a handy companion if you are needing some design ideas and plan on working with a designer in the future. I guess I was expecting more substance.The authors try really hard to be funny. They are also assuming their audience is female. I didn't enjoy this approach and found the writing boorish. There are some useful things in the book, but these things are far and few between.My favorite book so far is ""Great Kitchens: Design Ideas from America's Top Chefs""."
5,Superb,"After pouring over Home Improvement books full of pretty glossy photos and tired, useless information, I felt more discouraged than inspired. Until I found ""Everything and the Kitchen Sink"". It's loaded with solid, useful advice . . . and honest, down-to-earth humor. I highly recommend this smart and sassy book."
2,Quality of DVD Media is not good,"This is a review strictly on the quality of the physical media and not it's content.For starters, this item is not new. The plastic wrapping was torn at the top and side, giving me the impression that someone previously opened and returned it. After further inspection, half of the DVD's are either scratched or have smudges on them. Additionally, the audio on one of the DVDs I tested was out of sync with the video. This is probably the result of ""bootlegged"" or bad DVD burning, which is further evidenced by the store bought DVD-Rs that were used to burn the content on to.In conclusion, I imagine that the lessons on these DVD's were probably good. However, in this condition, it's not worth keeping it for $100. This product seems better priced at $30. I doubt I'd bother returning it if this was the case.Thanks to Amazon for a prompt refund."
5,even includes rare tracks,This release is great. Granted I have purchased it merely for the fact that it has perambulator and just like that included in it. These two tracks have not been released otherwise. Great afrobeat from the king himself.Fela Lives
4,Good place to start with Fela. Great sound!,"One CD is his jazz side, and one disc is his dance side, though both are jazzy, dance-y, funky and heavy. Good production values, song selection and sequencing make this collection a joy to listen to. Thankfully, these discs are not weighed down with stale political anthems or waterdowned afro-pop."
5,Great - look up the reviews,"Wonderful two guitar attack with a great vocalist doing great songs!Oh if this was on cd!!The only song I didn't intensely like is the title song - but that is good too - just more punk sounding than I usually like.I got this the same day I go ""october"" by U2 and I still don't know which one I like better. Very good!I haven't been as impressed by her other stuff - though it is worthy of checking out."
2,Did not live up expectations,"The book consisted of mainly stories of other weddings. Only one story showed how they budgeted and that couple went over budget. The budget wedding cost over $10,000. Ginger-ale is cheaper than that. The wooksheets in the book look useful but you can find similar charts in other better resources. Don't waste your money."
3,i dont know the didnt include any rules like the Deluxe Edition,"Ok, i think its great but you need to invent your own rules to play it.Maybe the Deluxe Edition will be a best option for the sand clock, spinner and the rules.I dont know why they can't include the rules at least printed on the box, how much it cost?Anyway, can keep busy a few kids for a while"
5,Find it Original Version,I was introduced to this game by a friend before Christmas and ordered one for my self and 3 others for gifts. I had also told a friend about it and she also purchased the games for gifts and themselves. I have spent alot of time and my husband who has dementia and he has played with it as well. Suggest you obtain one and find the fun and challenge in this game.
3,Interesting,"This Find It game grabbed my 8 yr. old grandson's interest when he opened it, and he had fun challenging his father to find the items hidden inside it. It's self-contained, which is a plus, I think. The problem is that it becomes useless after about half an hour. Once he found all the stuff, he put it aside and there it lays."
5,Can't walk by this game,"Great fun in pure simplicity! Roll the tube in your hands and look for hidden items. Strangely compelling and no one has been able to walk by the game without giving it a try. My 70 parents became so obsessed, I now have to purchase one for them. You can play alone, in a group, race the clock, whatever you want. The uncomplicated nature of the game lends itself to your imagination and your own rules. Can be taken anywhere! Take a side dish and this game to a party and you will notice how quickly people line up to play."
3,Its okay,I packed this on a long road trip with a 5 and a 3 year old boy. The 3 year old maybe played with it for a few minutes. The 5 year old had a ton of fun looking for all the objects but needed me to read the card for him of what to find and seemed to find them rather quickly. I tossed it around for a bit looking for the penny. It was a good time killer but not something i would play or give to my kids to play at home. I think if it were a little cheaper I would be more positive.
2,Too easy for my family,"Loses it's ""luster"" quickly. Too easy for me and my 13 year old. Found all the objects the first day we played with it. Maybe it would be more fun for younger kids, giving them more of a challenge."
4,It's Fun!!!,"It's fun....My seven year old & I looked for everything on the list for about an hour. We found everything but five objects. He learned what a paper fastener looked like. I find every so often someone is still shacking, twisting, & spinning it looking for that elusive piece. I like that theres no mess or pieces to lose."
5,Neat Game,"My kids and grandkids have been big fans of ""Where's Waldo"", so this was just an extension of that. They played with it endlessly over Christmas and even found the date on the penny."
2,Short and Simple but Good,"I have been a fan of Sheldon's In His Steps for many years like many others. I just recently learned of this book. It is a nice short story and I think that you will enjoy it. But if you have read In His Steps, you get the idea."
3,Ok for a short read,"I lost interest fairly quick, but made myself keep reading because of the book's message. I think too much time was spent in describing the children and not enough on how the resolutions were kept. Good theme but takes persevering to finish."
2,"""Better Together""","Hey Amazon-Your ""Better together"" Deal is for the SAME DVD that is in the box set. You might want to fix that!!!!"
2,Different titles same book,"I bought all the Pericone books thinking there'd be updates and new recipes in each one. They're all practically the same book, some almost word for word, just with different titles. If you're going to buy one of his books, just buy ONE, they all say the same thing."
5,recommendations for life,"I realized after I started the Perricone Promise I was eating horribly. I have made some drastic changes in my life and have embraced Dr. Perricone's anti-inflammatory diet. His plan is so easy to follow and actually enjoyable! I've tried the 28 day diet and am so pleased with my weight loss and improved skin radiance. Also, there is a promotion for a FREE GIFT in the back of the book. I could not resist and redeemed it with the purchase of his Neuropeptide Eye Contour. The dark circles around my eyes dramatically reduced and I receive daily comments on my appearance. Thanks Dr. Perricone!"
3,not what I thought,"I have to say I felt mislead by his appearence on Oprah. Never once did he mention his supplements or creams on that show, he just kept speaking of eating right. So, when I bought the book and noticed then he mentions all of the supplements and creams that cost a bloody fortune I was disappointed. I gave it 3 stars for the food choices and recipes, because that is how we need to be eating anyway, but who has the time to prepare gourmet lunches? Save your money, use common sense, work out and follow the food pyramid."
3,Kefir is nastier than nasty.,"This book is a nice motivational tool to get back on track if you've fallen into a bowl of pasta and can't pull yourself out.But that's all it is. There's not a lot of new info here. Or there might be a lot of new scientific info but I couldn't understand a bloody bit of it. I just wanted to know what to eat.I also intend to spend more of my money on vitamins and face creams now...just not his. I'm having a hard time believing this guy found the fountain of youth and bottled it.With that said, beware of the kefir beverages he recommends. They were just plain gross.Good Luck!"
2,Too technical for the average person to follow,"Although this book is very informative, it dwells too much on the technical. I was hoping that this book would be easier to read and it's suggestions easier to follow. They're not. Unless you have a private chef or a lot of time on your hands, the 28 day diet is almost impossible to follow. recipes are very elaborate (i.e. Saffron-Scented Oat Pilaf with Parsley) What the Heck!! Not to mention the suppliments that have to be purchased from either the Doc himself, or such stores as Nordstrom, Sephora, Saks or Neiman Marcus. After seeing Dr. Perricone on Oprah, I thought this book would offer the same simple tips for improving your diet and appearance that he offered on the show. It does not! I did however, come away with a list of some fruits and vegtables that I will incorporate into my daily diet."
5,Great Diet,I tried Perricone's diet and it makes me feel good and active. He has done his research and is aware of the new products available. I did not try the supplements. I felt they are over priced.
3,The Perricone Promise,"After reading this book I have to agree that trying to follow this diet is very hard for the average american to pull off. I checked into the acai berry and found out something great. You can drink it liquid form!! I didnt have to go far, I just did alittle research online. There is a product called Mona Vie and you dont have to search for it if you are looking to follow some or all of his meal advise. I have been taking this product for 1 1/2 weeks and feel great! I am happy I read the book even if this is what I learned. If you have any questions, contact me and I can get you the information. You can find me on Yahoo."
3,Just average,"I got this for my wife. She followed the recommenddations pretty faithfully. While they did have good effects, I would hardly call them spectacular. The book is OK"
2,The Perricone Promise,"I don't believe the book was rated correctly by the book seller. The book arrived with many of the pages written on and many others folded for future reference by the previous user(s), none of which were in the condition review. Maybe I am spoiled because I have gotten such excellent products before through Amazon. Didn't pay very much, but I would have been willing to pay more to get a book in better condition if I had known.Barbara"
5,given as a gift,One of the Christmas gifts given to my daughter in 2005. I am sure she was satisfied; I did not receive a feedback from her
2,was okay,"Save your money and just stick to this simple formula. Eat natural healthy foods and exercise. There, you can send me the money now."
3,Good condition,"The book had an ""old"" smell about it and several pages were turned down..but it was in ""ok"" condition for reading."
3,Something Else Yall,"I was quite saddened to see that I am going to have to sell my house and personal belongings to afford the face creams and supplements he recommends. On a positive note, I have done the diet part of the book for 2 days now, and must say my energy has skyrocketed! I actually jumped out of bed this morning, and usually I hit snooze 3-4 times.The book itself is well-written, but it is not riveting. It is quite scientific. If the information wasn't so amazing, I would have put it down right away. I love most of his tips. Eat lots of authentic foods, eat protein first at each meal, and use herbs LIBERALLY. The book says NOT to eat fat-free anything (I just about lived on expensive diet food products before). It was liberating to shop for fresh, whole foods this week. Thank you Dr. Perricone, you have written a great book, now please come up with a cream that the masses (Oprah excluded) can afford!"
3,Perricone Promise,"This product is good for first time readers of health books. It is, however, a replay of a lot of other books so for me there was a lot of everlap. I think the book is well researched and well written so it will help a lot of people."
1,ther's a sucker born every minute!!,"A snake oil salesman can always find a way of separating a fool from his money.If you believe what's in this book, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you cheap."
5,Aweome Find!!,"Dr. Perricone has done it again...not only was this book informative but motivational as well. This book is filled with delicious recipes, great tips on exercising and a healthy diet. After reading The Perricone Promise I was on a mission to ""look younger"".With all of the popularity these days of peptides in the skin care industry I felt as if I should be following the trend, however I felt uncomfortable using something that I knew nothing about. Now I feel as though I have been educated on peptides and can say that I am hooked.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to lead a healthier lifestyle and have younger looking skin. The book's author has a unique writing style that makes it very easy to read."
5,I just finished reading,"I just read the Perricone Promise and started following the program. I'm in my late 30's, but after a week on the diet, I feel so much better. This book is not another diet book, it actually makes you feel better. Dr. Perricone does not mislead in this well written guide to looking younger and living longer. I recommend it to anyone who wants to look good and vibrant. I feel confident whoever reads this book will feel refreshed."
4,Very Informative,This book is excellent and has indepth information about foods that help to reduce inflamation in the body. The products Dr. Perricone made and promotes are very expensive but the information itself is helpful. The diet he sets up is good and mostly uses common everyday whole foods and is very doable. I highly recommend it for the content and diet.
3,Perricone Medicore Promise,"There were some informative information in the book. However, a lot of it I kind a know from health magazines and internet search sites. The book came in good condition. I recommend just borrowing it from the library."
3,Nothing New Here,Frankly there is nothing really new here except that the author has tried to answer the common complaint againt the Perricone Prescription that there was little or no science to back up its claims. Now the pseudoscience is all collected in one spot for all to see. It works. These books are a powerful draw for an awful lot of people.
3,"Promises, promises, promises !!!","The doctor may promise all he likes, but for a healthy beautiful complexion it takes more than:Using his expensive facial productsEating sources of vitamin C such as olives along with strawberries--yuck!Thinking positive.We build new tissue every moment--skin, internal organs, and rejuvenating body fluids. There are many Asian health secrets that are vital for health and beauty. This book is only the beginning"
2,I Returned This Book,"This is not Advanced Strategies. The book was poorly written and can be clasiffied as elementary. The section on technical analysis was weak. Martin J. Pring's book on technical analysis is half the price and worth 20 times the value. If you know the basics about Level II, don't bother. The strategies mentioned are elementary."
5,Review of Tony's Book,"At meetings of the Day Trader's of Orange County, the most common question of seasoned traders is ""How do you do it?"". Tony's book answers that question. Many authors on personal self-development advise that the quickest way to success is to find someone who is doing what you want to achieve and do what they do. This book provides that kind of mentoring. This book began distribution as a supplement to Tony's two-day class instruction which I had the pleasure to attend. The amazing revelation from the class and the book, is that to be successful and make a living at trading one does not have to memorize the contents of ten books on technical analysis, each of which are two inches thick. A small number of indicators and patterns used well is worth a fortune compared to many indicators used poorly. I wish I had read Tony's book before I read all of those books on technical analysis."
2,"$75,000 Ford Pinto",I just got this book today from Amazon through overnight shipment. I was very excited to read this. Like you I read the reviews on the book and decided to pay the $100.83(shipment included). I thought those who talked bad of the book were just negative people or something. I did finish the book in two and half hours. The print is huge. This book is a joke. I am amazed how bad it really is. It has zero new information. You can find all the information in this book on the internet for FREE. Pass it up.
1,I had to return this book,"This book is for beginners. If you know what level II is, and you know what an AX is, you don't need this book. The section on level II was very small, and the rest of the book is filled with ""trading philosphy"" and a description of TA indicators. You can read this book in 45 minutes.So if you think you'll improve your level II trading from this book, think again."
2,Overpriced book,"The book is OK but I question the value. At $96 this book is extremely overpriced. I read the same information, such as the Level II screen, support, resistance and trend lines etc, in other day trading books that cost only a fraction of this book.Also, you can tell that this book is self published."
3,Again more basics,"Have a look at Level II on a heavy volume stock and tell me what you see. I mean, it is nice to look at, but this is not all.This book talks about basic stuff but lacks in more detailed information e.g. about ECN's and there difference. Just some words about the trading software Realtick and how to use it. Talking about the tricks of using Realtick would be more helpful then explaining trendlines, support and resistance. This is MUST to know before you start trading! And what about candelsticks ?However, for the beginner this book is more helpful then some of the other so called day trading books."
2,"OK, but not worth the price","This book is OK, but it lacks any real substance. For the price it is just not worth it."
2,JUST ANOTHER DAY TRADING BOOK,"If you've read one book on Day Trading, you've already learned most of it. For $90+, I expected much more. I don't consider this a reference book."
2,I would re-name the book Basic Short-TermTrading Strategies,"The book is well written, however it doesn't really contain any new info and was not worth the money. I expected more substance, especially the chapters on Level II. It didn't contain anything I hadn't read in books costing 1/3 the price."
5,I read it and I loved it,"I think this is a great book and I highly recommend it. The reason I loved this book so much is because it is thorough, yet very easy to understand and implement. The coverage of TA, Level II, and trading for a living is comprehensive, yet it is not intimidating in any way. Excellent read."
2,Definitely for beginning daytraders only,"I've got to be honest, after reading the other reviews of this book...I had expected alot more information on daytrading entry/exit techniques. This book covers alot of BASIC technical analysis, which I don't have a problem with per se. Keeping things simple is often key in trading in general, but he doesn't provide many examples on an intraday basis. There was really very little helpful daytrading information in my opinion for anyone who has more than a rudimentary intraday trading background...My biggest problem is with the price. This book should be somewhere around $30 at best. If I had paid that much, I wouldn't be as annoyed as I am right now...I found Tony's other book that provides a day-by-day commentary in a real life trading environment much more useful...I would stay away from this one unless you are a complete beginner...I blew through it in a few hours and I'm no expert in an intraday time frame..."
5,The best stock trading book I ever read.,"Stock Trading Wizard is a masterpiece. The layout of the book is great as it teaches you step by step how to build a successful trading system. Unlike so many books, the ""meat"" is not covered with hundreds of extra words and every strategy is well illustrated. I read it four times already and I keep finding new things I missed or did not pay attention to, the first couple of times I read it.My recommendation is to get the book and read it again and again and again. This is a DAMN good book."
1,I don't understand why this book costs so much.,"I brought this book in 2000 when I tried to learn trading. The reason I brought it was because it was so expensive and had many 5 star reviews. I thought it must has money making secret inside. However, it only contains some simple basic trading informations and some basic strategy, which is OK if it the book costs 10 dollars. I suspect those reviews were written by the author and his friends in order to boost sale."
2,Decent Book But Price Is Way Out of Line,"This book certainly has some helpful information which you'll probably find in most any of the good books on trading. But there is no great revelation in this book to the point that it warrants such a high price tag. There are many, many other very good books on trading for half the cost of this one."
5,GOOD BOOK,"As a people who is interested in Freemason staff, I feel happy for this book 'cause it tells much information I want."
2,Light on details,"Although a handsome book with excellent and interesting photographs,the author makes no attempt whatsoever to enlighten the reader to even the most simple, everyday symbols of the Freemasons. For example, I was able to search the web for 10 minutes and discover more information regarding the beautiful symbolism and history of the Freemasons than I could find in this entire book. I did not expect the author to divulge sacred rites and rituals, but this book was far too watered-down and repetitive to be of interest. From a historical perspective, there are some interesting bits but they are too few and far between."
3,Digitally Remastered,"Budget-priced compilation featuring 20 digitally remastered original recordings by this legendary bandleader. Comes packaged in an embossed double gatefold digipack with silver lettering. The songs includes ""In The Mood,"" ""Moonlight Serenade"" and ""Chattanooga Choo Choo."""
4,Comprehensive,"Pretty comprehensive coverage of various aspects of fishing for Shad. He covers different methods of fishing for shad (not just fly fishing). It is especially detailed with respect to the design of many, many flies for shad fishing. I would have liked more illustrations and pictures instead of verbal descriptions. I would also have liked a detailed description of how to find out exactly when to go shad fishing, other than showing up to fish and seeing if fish are there are not."
3,Not her best work,"I have tried to like this album but it just doesn't work for me. It simply does not compare to Warm Leatherette and Nightclubbing. It lacks the funk element of Sly and Robbie and the songs themselves are just too ordinary for Grace Jones. The artwork is very creative, like all of the GJ albums. 'I'm Not Perfect' is probably the best song on the album. Information is speculating on the internet that something new is in the works for 2007. Let's hope so."
2,IMO her worst album,"A couple of years ago I purchased this at an online auction because after having all of her Island albums which are classics, I had to get all of the others.This one stuck out as the only bad album she did, in my opinion.The sound is very thin, very 80s, but mostly the tracks are annoying, very repetitive and what's worst, the sound pretty much the same. The choruses are the parts that stick out as just plain bad, kinda like they started to write the music for the songs by trying to make the melody for them, but they are just bad.Bulletproof heart on the other hand, her other Manhattan album, done 3 years after this one, is a jem of an album, with much more texture, more melody, tunes that sound very different from the others.If you need to get this, don't pay too much."
2,Is she perfect for you??,"Grace's rise to fame in the music industry was largely due to two singles""Pull Up To The Bumper"" and ""Slave To The Rhythm"".While her albums found their way into an artsy crowd,most of her work was ignored including this one...Inside Story fails to really capture the listener's attention.The opener I'm Not Perfect may've been a sizeable hit but it probably remains the only memorable tune here.Despite having Nile Rogers as producer, the songs lack depth and expression.Hollywood Liar,Victor,Party Girl etc. all sound like b-sides.On White Collar Crime however,she perks up a bit and sings about the rich and the elite ""getting away with it"", which makes you want to listen to the words again, briefly.Let's just hope that one day Miss Jones returns with an album that recaptures our attention.After all she does have a good voice!"
2,"Very good product, very bad price","The product quality is great, but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D'Oro brand due to the ongoing strike. The retail price clearly marked on each package is $2.79, so a case of 12 packages should retail for $33.48 plus shipping. Since the cost of this product is $47.95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages, make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D'Oro before ordering."
2,Still fails to please,"I have never really liked comps as i always have to get up and skip tracks which i dont like and there is usually a few, much as i like some of the bands on this fat comp it still just does'nt work really i mean some tracks are great on it it's just a bit of a let down thats a waste of money considering i bought it for 15 when i should have been 5. Having said that the previous fat comp is alot better than this."
5,A Delightful Surprise,"DEEPER STILL is Rick James at his romantic best. The title track and ""Stop It"" simmer with funk and salsa, while the funky ""Taste"" and ""Stroke"" cleverly blend in details from his troubled 1990's run-ins with the law. The biggest surprises here are Mr. James' soulful reading of Crosby, Stills and Nash's ""Guinnevere"" and ""Sapphire"", a heartfelt tribute to strong black women. And of course Rick's sexy side comes through on ""Do You Wanna Play"" and ""Funk With Me"". Musicianship is top-notch throughout, especially on the hopeful ballad ""Maybe"". The best part about DEEPER STILL is that the whole album is 52 minutes, a great length for an album that doesn't overstay its welcome."
5,Awesome recording!,"The funkmaster himself proves that he hadn't lost a beat. Pretty much every track on this cd is slammin'. I found myself crusing in my car while enjoying this nice piece. Rick definitely laid it down. I urge any Rick James fan to go out and cop this project before it somehow ends up out of print. After all, we all know how the industry can get far as letting good albums and cd's no longer be available to purchase."
5,Quiet Storm Funk from the Great Rick James,"The King of Punk Funk left us with a great album after he passed. Deeper Still is an album you can listen to 1000 times and not get bored. Rick's vocals are strong and the instrumentals from funk to latin funk, jazz, soul that accompany it do a great job. Today's music MTV and BET play's is pure garbage, Rick was a legend and you can the difference between a real artist like Rick and the marketed promo hype MTV and the radio plays. Get this album you won't be disappointed. From the man who brought you Super Freak to the now Funk with Me, from Ebony Eyes to the now Guinevere, from Give it to me baby to the now Deeper Still."
1,A WASTE,THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE IVE BEEN USING IT FOR A MONTH NOW...THE ONLY RESULTS I SEE IS MY NAILS BUT AS FAR AS HAIR ''HELL NO'' DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE
2,tank overhaul needs a overhaul,"I bought this set of DVDs expecting a close inside look at the tanks and the restoration proccess, There is more film clips of scenery and traffic not to mention dramatic close up of people staring at the camera ! than there is of the tanks, the editing seem to jump all over the place, how many times do i need to see cloudscapes floating past the workshop ?? lots of flag waving and over acting, much like a reality tv show, what was shown about the tanks was interesting but too little of it,i am very disappointed with the DVDs, but the service from the supplier was excellent."
5,"THis ""Old Book"" was such a blessing!","I read this from the church library, much older and used looking. THe new book looked like a ""new book"" which was great since I bought it for a gift. I pray it was as much a blessing to her as it was to me."
5,The Helper,"This is one of the best books I've ever read (on my top 10 all time list). If you sense that there has to be more to your life and are looking for how to ""get there"", read this book (then read it again). It will guide you from ""just getting by"" to ""full speed ahead"" if you are willing to take its message to heart!"
1,Well worth it ...,This book is a blessing to all who would read it. Even though written in the seventies it is fresh and powerful for today's seeker.
4,"Works well, looks nice",I installed this K&N Intake Kit on a 2008 Dodge Dakota 4.7L a couple weeks ago. I thought I had done something wrong when I had given it some throttle. I knew to expect some added noise but didn't expect the growl of the motor to come into the cabin. There was a slight improvement to throttle response. I drive city streets to work so I can't really speak to any mileage increase. Installation was easy and it looks nice under the hood.
2,Check the version,"The folks who sold this to me were absolutely wonderful, however, it turns out that this is a new reprint of the 1909 version and was therefore, unsuitable for my use. I was quick to get a refund and they were easy to communicate with and never questioned the refund. Check the version/edition carefully when ordering this item."
5,Best thing since portable post hole,"I have used one these for years as a residential electrican installing hundreds of switches and outlets a year. I would never have lasted 30 years without one, great time saver too."
3,For those who love San Francisco only,"Not the most fabulous writing around, and definitely put-downable, The Immigrants is not for those who aren't already in love with San Francisco. If you are one who would take out your old love letters just to reminisce about days that were great and awful at the same time, you might enjoy this book. The story isn't enthralling in any way, but the backdrop...He does justice to the growth and plunder of the best city on earth"
1,"Trivial, boring, dull, cliched stereotypes","Whew. Those other reviewers must have read a different book, or they're all on acid. One of them even used ""The Immigrants"" to compare Fast to F. Scott Fitzgerald! The authors who come to my mind are Edna Ferber and James Michener, who were both more adept than Fast at using the trivial genre of ""family saga"" as the basis for a good adventure story. ""The Immigrants"" is a skin-deep, boring travelogue of events in the lives of a dull selection of character stereotypes. The cliches are thick and fast. I could hardly hold the book up. All I can think is that the often fascinating Fast was showing off his famous eclecticism by demonstrating that he could write trash with the worst of them."
4,linear shadings in the moment,"If you are a connessouir of line in music and poetry, then this CD creates a wonderful environment for you to drop into.Robert Creeley and Steve Swallow need no introduction, both are masters ond originators of linear performance. Chris Massey and John Mills are the new underlings, the apprentices, the artists who will take the idea's and run with them into a new world of extreme fragility. Here the lines weave in and out and around each other, spoken word and music. I've never heard a better represenataion of the joining of the two styles.Saxophone, bass, drums, voice. Intimate and daring.Why hasn't this been more visible in the print media???A must for Creeley fans!"
1,read the negative reviews,"I should have believed all the negative reviews but I thought it would be worth buying expecially since it was cheap.I was wrong, I didn't get much out of this book at all.Save your money."
4,Walter Matthau At His Heart Warming Best,"In most roles, Walter Matthau is the wise cracking, cantancerous character who leaves us a bit perplexed but loving his character anyway. In Kotch, Mr. Matthau plays a wise, loving grandfather trying to connect with his son and daughter-in-law's impatience with this old man whom she deems ready to be put ""out to pasture"". Not only is Mr. Matthau's character not ready for the nursing home, he's more than ready to enjoy the rest of his life to the fullest. This is a wonderfully warm, sometimes sentimental, sometimes funny depiction of what life could be like in later years and Walter Matthau, as usual, does the role justice."
4,Sweet drama...,The story is sweet and the acting is great. The whole family will be able to watch this movie. It is an older movie so don't look for wonders in carmera working or scenery that makes you swoon.The family of Kotch wants to put him in a retirement home but he doesn't think that is what he wants. He meets a young abandoned yound lady that makes him feel needed. They develop a father/daughter type relationship.
4,Heartwarming,"There's not a lot I can add to the reviews here, but this film is a very worthwhile one, and one that you don't see anymore. Touching characters, plot, funny yet sentimental, a meeting of young and old, both of whom seem to have not a whole lot else in their lives, but they help each other to find purpose and meaning. A forgotten gem!"
2,From the Big Screen:A Bad Copy of Good Music,"Every once in a while when purchasing a CD, I like to go out on a limb and try something new. I had seen most of the movies that Band of the Life Gaurds chose to put music from on their CD. So I was surprised upon hearing the recording I recieved in the mail. This band took these pieces of music and with the use of synethizers and such turned what was once something suitable to listen to into a piece of unrecognizable garbage. If you like the kind of music that is offered in this CD, do yourself a favor and just buy the music from their original soundtracks."
5,"Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,you and I...","A portion of the lyrics from, ""The Folks Who Live On The Hill"", a tune from Loesser's ""Most Happy Fella"", and Sammy Davis and Laurindo Almeida perform it to perfection. A lovely album from the late sixties on Reprise, I believe this to be one of Mr. Davis's finest.A low key album, great for late in evening listening, every song is a gem. I have been putting it on my record player ,my cd player and now my IPod, for thirty plus years and it still delights me."
5,"Great, But The Best Is Gone","A truely great collection, but I was dismayed that the best cut on the original LP, ""Deep In a Dream"" is gone. Whoever chopped that one off should be drawn and quartered. But, what's left is still wonderful."
4,Great for a rainy afternoon,"I got this on vinyl quite a few years ago. The record is long gone and I decided to buy the CD. I was so glad that it is still in print. It is a beautiful little gem, full of beautiful, quite surprises. I love the melancholy, the sadness, and at the same time, the joy it can bring to me as I listen. I don't think that David had the best voice in the business but he really shines here. The simplicity of acoustical guitar of Almeida gives this album an intimacy that one rarely finds in recorded music. It's a rare collections of great songs that I highly recommend to those who sometimes like music soothing and warm."
4,"VERY DIFFERENT, YET ENJOYABLE!","Upon playing this (As well as trying to fool some friends), one can quickly tell that it IS Sammy Davis, Jr.! SMOOTH ALL THE WAY THROUGH, but by the time you get to the 8th track, it's all kinda sounding the same, so don't expect no 'Twists', 'Turns', And 'Bends' vocally, just pure straight singing!, WITHOUT the fanfare of Horns, Orchestra, And all the other stuff they would do to sell a record. This is something I'd call a great conversation starter...And perfect for the Wine And Cheese group."
3,Appeared to have had a LONG shelf life,"This product work well so far and would have received more stars except that the packaging looked REALLY old and there was a dent on the top. I would have sent it back, but could not find a replacement model exactly like this one. It was expensive and I expected a brand new perfect player."
4,Weber Genesis grill,"While this unit took me more than the much stated 1/2 hour to assemble, along with having to buy separate tank and get it filled, this is a wonderful and easy unit to use. The food cooks evenly and quickly on direct heat; while the indirect heat method as instructed also works well. For the regular family, cooking about 6 burgers, a few dogs is a piece of cake. I also cooked whole chickens, vegtables and ribs to my satisfaction. For the price, its a quality and easy to use grill. If Amazon still has the special on the grill cover, get the cover - it fits well and looks good. Also I bought Webers Barbeque and Grilling Book - about $15 - its great and easy to follow for some great recipes and added insights. Get it."
4,Grill gets 4 stars - Amazon gets a black eye,"I've revised my review. I originally was so damn upset about not getting the grill in a timely manner that I rated it 1 star - which is unfair to the grill. It's a great buy, very easy to assemble (I assembled it by myself in less than an hour - but I recommend a helper for the lifting). It heats up quickly and evenly and it's big enough to roast a turkey in (which I've done).Beware, Amazons partners seem to have a lot of issues. It took me close to 5 weeks to receive the grill, and I jumped through the same hoops as the other negative reviewers but I don't blame Weber for the experience. If you're in a hurry to receive your grill, I recommend buying it locally."
1,Never got it ... thanks to Amazon,"Buyer beware! After being a good customer of Amazon's for many years and never having a problem, they sure dropped the ball on this one! The grill shipment was delayed so many times I never got it. When I requested a refund, they refused it. I am still out of pocket $500 and never got the grill! Notice how Amazon doesn't list their customer service telephone number anywhere? If you have a problem with shipment or delivery, good luck. I have 13 e-mail responses to date from Amazon saying they are working on it and it's been well over a month... time to call my credit card company. My advice - the grill costs less at your local ""big box"" store and it's already assembled."
2,Disappointed,"Even as I write this my wife is cooking what we wanted to cook on the grill, on our stove. This is the second time my Genesis Silver has been unable to get a good flame going. The tank is full and the flame is low. A few months ago a repair person came our and told us that there was a clog in the gas line. Once cleared it worked fine for a few weeks, but now, back at it. I was happy initially with the product. It has held up well to the elements and looks pretty good now two years later, but if it doesn't work what is the point."
2,Stickers on a teapot set??,"Another reviewer here said, ""Unfortunately the company used paper stickers instead of the waterproof ones, so if your little ones want to put water or cookies into play, expect damage to the stickers."" I wish I had seen this comment before buying this product. Yes, the tea set is pretty to look at, for a while, and fun to play with for my 3-year-old. She completely loved it, until she saw the princess stickers disappear. Surely, my daughter cannot be the only child who wants to use water for this kind of play, pretending it is tea or coffee? Also, the first thing I do upon purchasing a toy for my child is -- to wash it! It makes no sense whatsoever to use stickers on a product such as this. After the stickers start to peel off, the tea set looks unattractive and cheap."
5,Granian Arrives!,"I've followed the band since '98 and with the release of On My Own Two Feet, Garen & Co. have outdone themselves once more! With so many potential radio hits, it's a mystery why Granian remains unsigned! This is the kind of album you play again and again. Great work!-Macauley"
4,"[Three-and-a-half stars out of four] ...""Make Room for Max. Headroom...""","The Maximun Headroom here is a malfunctioningcomputer character based on Matt Frewer's 'reallife' in this Pilot originally cast for the BBC.Frewer, a Canadian-American is the only non-britin here and the lovely Amanda Pays by herself isworth a watch by herself! Spawned the short-lived,but well-made t.v. series which coincided with theshort-lived and tragically bad 'new coke'. But I'dtrade the (Nutri-)poison diet coke for new cokeany day! Bring back 1985 with Cheap Trick's greatLP 'Standing on the Edge'. At least they had a realBassist then (Jon Brant)! Look for the 'Tricksterson Tour for their 35th season this summer!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Jerky for Desert,"I have found a few different flavors,that I like a lot.I have mixed several different flavors to make it a lot hotter.This book has a lot of different ideals to try,it is easy to read and full of a lot of handy information.I would recommend this to anyone that is intrested in making their own Jerky at home.I have used most of the recipes in it already"
2,"Some interesting recipes, some issues.","I'm confused about the cover as it relates to the topic. Jars of layered beans and so forth that appear to be soup mixes as the cover for a book on jerky? Okayyyy....The book could have used closer editing. Ms. Dolen was sabotaged by her spell checker as well. 'card omen' instead of cardamom, 'tobacco' instead of Tabasco. The directions are often unclear and confusing. 'DRAIN AND ASSEMBLE ON DEHYDRATOR OR YOUR FAVORITE SUNNY SPOT.' 'Seven Step Jerky' has a list of eight ingredients and no instructions. 'Fave Jerky Recipe' and 'Hot and Smoky' each have four ingredients listed, no instructions, and three of the four ingredients are the same. The former just doesn't include salt.There is an undercurrent of humor, which is fun.Bottom line - not a keeper."
2,Unorganized / Poor Effort,"I would argue that the author found all of these recipes online, and did little more than ""cut and paste."" Recipes are in no particular order, the book bounces back and fourth between various animal jerky types, and there is no consistency in the serving sizes (i.e. one recipe yields 5 lbs, another 1 lb, and others 3 lbs). It 90% of the recipes are bland, and the 10% that are good mirror the recipes on ALLRECIPES.COMIf you are looking for a well edited / thought out book with flavorful jerky recipes, look elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend this book unless the price was dropped to $.99"
2,Modern not,"Countess Zattiany, who is 58, has a glandular operation (based on a silly popular theory of the day), the result being that she has the looks and personality of one who is 28. She falls in love with Lee Clavering, an ambitious young journalist. Even after telling him the truth about herself, he wants to marry her. But she marries an Austrian prince instead in order to pursue a diplomatic career. In the book at one point Atherton has the Countess describe the modern novel as ""gloomy, pessimistic, excoriating, merciless, drab, sordid, and hideously realistic."" Many of those terms describe this novel, too. Atherton was an old-fashioned novelist who thought she could be modern if she talked modern. But this book is very old-fashioned and a bit tiresome as well."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter and immediately regretted it when I heard how awful it sounded. The sound quality is absolutely horrible; you can hardly hear the lyrics over the static. On top of that, there is no volume control and the volume is set way too loud..."
2,Degree in electrical wiring not required but it helps!,"This toy, cute though it might look, was clearly designed by a deaf engineer who has nothing but a deep-rooted disdain for parents. Without a doubt, it is the loudest toy I have ever seen. The lack of a volume control is bewildering. I would much rather they save money by doing away with the Play/Demo switch and install a volume control instead.All is not lost, however. This wasn't the first toy that was gifted to us (curse you, evil mother-in-law!) and I have gotten quite adept at installing a small volume control. You can get them at your local Radio Shack. Well worth the time it takes to learn how to do it. I've ""fixed"" several toys this way.All in all, I cannot recommend this toy."
2,A dud,Daughter was impressed with this when she opened it at her 3rd birthday party....for about 10 minutes. She hasn't touched it since.
2,The Sitcom is way Better!,I also love the original sitcom but I saw an episode rerun of the variety thing and I didn't think it was all that!The previous reviewer states that the sitcom ran from 1965 til 1969 but that is incorrect. The first season of the sitcom started in 1969 not 1965 and it ran until sometime in the mid 70's like 1973 or 1974 and then later on this variety show came along and Eve Plum wisely said no.
2,Worst post-series special of the cast.,"I thought this was a silly show. I think they were trying to make a franchise out of this series long after it ended. I think the show being in syndication with the reruns was a better way to know the cast than this show. A few okay performances, but the end result comes off as corny. I think that Christopher Knight has had the best adult success lately with him being on the Surreal Life and a spinoff show. It makes me accept his identity more, not Bobby Brady. This variety series doesn't tell me much."
2,a LITTLE Disturbing...,even though it is a little bit disturbing this DVD is funny and well that's pretty much it.you will probably only enjoy this if you are beyond creepily(i wasn't sure on the spelling of creepily but it's supposted to be pronounced creep-a-lee) obsessed with the Bradys!ps i really recomend watching Happy Days!!!!
5,THE BRDAY BUNCH HOUR,"I saw V 2, and I called out ""MINE!"" I loved that show! Then 1time I got V1. LMAO, in fact, on 1 of my cassete shows I do, i used the song from V2, to show how I was all allone. It was the song Greg and Carol did, the duett All By Myself/Tace's Of Love. Iwish they could get the piolet on tpe, I liked, as a kid, when they did CAR WASH! However, I remember Carol doing it, but I found out it was Alice! LOL!"
5,OH MY GOSH!! WHAT A HOOT!,"After reading the reviews from other Amazon purchasers, I simply HAD to add this to my collection. I was 6 years old when the Brady Bunch TV show premiered and I remember watching these Variety Hours as a pre teen wondering what on earth?? I can truly say watching them as an ADULT was a million times better! This DVD is so ridiculous that it's HILARIOUS!! Robert Reed should have become a hot dog cart vendor before agreeing to be in this ridiculous Variety show! The way he is acting is nothing short of ludicrous. The skits are ridiculous, the colors are so mind-bending that you should turn the color down on your tv, and the acting is a zero on a scale from 1-10. Yet, because of all this, it is entertaining in a strange way. The whole time I was watching it, I was thinking WHAT ON EARTH??? There wasn't a single time that this show was normal or entertaining. Just plain LUDICROUS!! If you are a kid of the 60's/70's era of the Brady Bunch, you gotta get this!!!"
3,Fake Jan!!,"Oh lord do I remember watcing this when it first came on. I was so excited that the Bradys were back together. But they weren't. We got Fake Jan instead of Real Jan! My oh my is this show bad. I still love it, though. What confuses me is why did Rhino release a box oset of all six episodes of Pink Lady & Jeff (which is even worse than this show) and only two episodes of the Brady Bunch Hour? I mean, come on. There were only eight episodes of this show so why not just release the entire series and be done with it?Yes, this show is a bad as everyone has said it is. For this cheap of a price, treat yourself to a bit of TV weirdness and pick this up. The costumes alone are worth the price of admission."
2,How's your pain threshold?,"My partner and I rented this over the holidays for a laugh. In the sense that it's the strangest thing we'd ever seen, it did achieve the laughter goal. The cast introduces the musical numbers in character (as in, ""Ladies and Gentleman, our brother Greg""). Also, Alice inexplicably wears her blue maid uniform on stage.But the fact that they're supposed to be related occasionally seems to be overlooked. Skits where the brothers are cruising the sisters, and Donny and Marie are playing boyfriend and girlfriend are two examples. However the best is when Greg ""moves out"", and he and Carol sing a lovelorn duet to each other. Remember, they're mother and son, people! I wouldn't recommend buying this DVD, but it does make for a great Saturday afternoon rental."
1,You will not believe just how AWFUL is this program ! ! !,"I tried to warn my friends just how AWFUL the Brady Bunch Variety Hour was, before I pressed the close drawer buttonon the DVD player.""Yeah,Yeah, We know!, We know!"" they smugly replied.""Okay, get ready to view television history"".And away went some 47 minutes of our lives that we can never recover. 47 minutes that seemed like 47 hours.Mind-numbling, ""what were they thinking"" bad TV.One just-terrible production number after another,tied together with some lame story line.Words fail me how ghastly this show is.If you are a fan of truly bad TV, you gotta see this!"
4,A Bad Blast From the Past!,"I give this four stars due to the unintentional yet hillarious camp value of this, quite possibly the worst TV program EVER!!! If I were to rate it as per actual quality I would have to give it zero stars. This Krofft production makes their ""Pink Lady and Jeff"" look like ""Your Show of Shows"" in comparison. Florence Henderson and Barry Williams both have the goods to pull off a variety show, but the Brady Buck ends there, and unfortunately there are 6 more Brady's to deal with (though Maureen McCormick certainly can sing) not counting Alice. If you know what you are buying you will not be disappointed."
4,So unbelievably bad that it's incredible fun to watch!,"Trust me when I say this: the show and therefore the DVD are brutal. Awful. A complete embarrassment. And entertaining as all hell! The show is an acid-trip mess of Brady whitebread smarminess and Krofft Brothers bizarre-ness that has to be seen to be believed. Poor Robert Reed...as if he didn't hate playing Mike Brady enough, he was turned into a song-and-dance man for this show and he was anything but. At one point, you actually see him stop dancing and laugh at himself because he was so far off his mark. Another time, you actually see Greg wipe out on a roller rink and the editors completely miss it. It's almost unwatchable, but for those who appreciate great cheese like I do, it's a goldmine! I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since I saw Waiting For Guffman."
5,"A thoroughly entertaining, heartfelt picturebook story","Imaginatively written by Carolyn Arden and beautifully illusrated by Jim Postier, Goose Moon is the highly recommended thoroughly entertaining, heartfelt picturebook story of a young girl and her adventures on Grandfather's farm over the seasons."
2,Poor choice,"At the minimum, any Oracle DBA book should have scripts for doing hot & cold backups. This book does not. Reference the Sams book by Thakkar if you want to learn how to write a DOS batch file to do backups."
1,Disappointed,Contains a lot of useless information and falls short of explaining anything useful. It contains a lot of material which is not tied together and contains mistakes in a lot of parts.
1,Good in parts - totally wrong in others...,"While this is a good overview of oracle8 on NT, there are some major mistakes. The section on backups is at best misleading - the part on hot backups in 100% wrong. Had this book been reviewed by a junior DBA, these mistakes would have been spotted."
1,Worst book I have ever read,Extremely difficult to understand. It jumps from one topic to another without completing what it started to explain. Examples are not very helpful and cannot really be used practically. Doesn't explain how to implement certain suggestions it makes.
4,Good find,"I got this for my Pastor because he did a sermon about how he keeps ordering cd's with the December 's Bleak Midwinter, but when he gets it the 2nd and what he says is the most important verse the artists are leaving out- Allison Crowe does not.. I listened to it though, and all of this CD is very good.. her voice is amazing and this is a great Christmas CD to have.. I may have to order one for myself too.."
5,Optimal delivery,"It really was a super-quick delivery, within 6 days it arrived in the Netherlands, great service. I was looking for this cd for a long time, and here it was finally. Thanks a lot."
2,A mixed bag of efforts?,"On some songs, her style and interpretation meld wonderfully. A very alternative version of Hallelujah is both melancholic and refreshing. A job well done on In The Bleak Midwinter, a woefully under-covered song. My other favorite is What Child Is This, perhaps her best piece on the album vocally where she demonstrates her best power with control.Allison has a pure, penetrating, and beautiful voice, one part Jewel, one part Cher, one part Allison. Unfortunately, I think she overdoes some of the vocals, trying to 'Aguilera' up a song a bit much, and some tonal miscues are the result. She gets a little carried away on O Holy Night, trying to simultaneously embellish and go up-tempo, a little too ambitious for her, IMO. River, a Joni Mitchell cover, suffers from chord over-simplification, and the interpretation doesn't really work for me.All in all, not a bad effort, but her rapid vibrato style doesn't fit most of the tunes, save Hallelujah and What Child."
2,big gun poorly aimed,"An on-line review recommended Allison Crowe's version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah as the best of the cover versions. It's not. Crowe has a powerful voice and excellent taste in her material, but her approach lacks either sufficient bombast or sufficient subtlety to be comparable with Janis Joplin or Kate McGarrigle. These are plain and predictable readings of good songs and have the sense of a talent being squandered."
2,"nothing new, nothing interesting","I hate to just dismiss an artist as not interesting, but I am surprised to see another reviewer claiming that her voice is both technically stunning but her soul is what is singing.While her voice is technically very good, I wouldn't call it stunning, and I just don't feel the soul in this music. So what's so great about this? Not much. Its so mediocre that I had to write a review just to balance these unbelievably high ratings."
5,Kama Sutra means happy couples!,"We are happily married but always looking for new ways to keep our love life vital. We love this series because it explains the basic concepts of the Kama Sutra and how to keep the spirituality in lovemaking. The DVD is part workshop, with couples talking about their likes and dislikes, and learning how to better please each other and satisfy each other's needs. The workshops are hosted by Dr. Patti Britton, who is very knowledgeable about the ancient Kama Sutra and very comfortable talking about sex and sex acts. There is good emphasis on setting the atmosphere and putting yourself in a mood to enhance sex. There are also hot, steamy, explicit sex scenes featuring the couples from the workshop. It's great seeing sex addressed as an ancient philosophy as opposed to current society's tendency to present it as sinful or dirty. I highly recommend all three volumes."
2,No gaskets,We received the product but we didn't recieve the two gaskets that should have came with it. I can't find a way to send seller a message. So it leaks something terrible without the gaskets. It's also an odd shaped gasket so not sure where we can get them. It would cost us more to send it back then try and find some place to buy a gasket or tape it.
2,"Not organized well, kinda cheezy, would've like more info","I have always been fascinated by the waverly hills sanatorium, and this dvd just sucked in comparison to the actual place. I am one who loves history channel type shows on places, and the unorganized format of this documentary made it hard to enjoy. I like that these were one on one interviews, but most of the information was misplaced or repeated several times. just confusing. i'll wait for the history channel to make something."
2,"""So-So, but falls short!""","I found this installment on 'Waverly Hills' to be fair but not really that great! The photos of ""Ghosts"", ""Shadow People"", and ""Orbs"" are very poor and hard to define. This DVD is more a historical documentary on the history of Waverly, not so much the ""Hauntings""."
1,Totally Disappointed!,"This video wasn't what I expected,much more like a scary home video than a documentary. I got bored very quickly and extremely annoyed with the sound effects. I love Waverly Hills, but wouldn't recommend this video to anyone."
2,had some goods and bads,well this movie was ok but they showed alot of the same clips over and over.But the telling of the history is pretty good.
3,History lesson good...scary....not!,"The history of the Waverly Hills Sanitorium is facinating is this documentary, but the ghostly pictures and evidence are blurry (as always) and they seem to be desperatly searching for anything that might make a goosebump. Not bad if your into paranormal, just a little too dramasized."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This has to be the most dissapointing DVD purchase of my life. I thought I was getting something genuinely scare that offered real compelling evidence of supernatural activity but instead it was the same old fuzzy orbs, evp that sounds like nothing till a suggestion is put into your head and the odd shadowy figure that again looks like nothung until cropped sharpened and a caption is inserted to suggest what it is. Unbelievable clap trap. I have no doubt that the sanitorium itself is an opressive and scary place to visit but this DVD conveys nothing of that and comes across as less scary than a bad episode of Most Haunted. Big big let-down"
1,Snail Mail Excitement...Total Disappointment,I couldn't stand the excitement of waiting for this movie to come in the mail. Amazon did an awesome job of getting it to me very quickly! As soon as I received the DVD and popped it in. This movie was a total disappointment. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I'd like to call it a complete mess. I dont know what the producer/director was going for when creating this mess but they did an outstanding job marketing the movie.
2,overhyped,this movie was way overhyled it was just all over the place with a few claims that I know were fabercated
1,Incorrect facts = disappointing,"I'm not sure one can call this video a documentary. Aren't documentaries based on facts? Many, many facts that this video claims about Waverly Hills, simply aren't true. But the most glaring is the fact that 60,000+ people didn't die in Waverly Hills in it's entire existance as a sanitorium, much less in a single year.Was this film made to enhance the history of Waverly and it's patients? Not if the facts aren't correct.If I could give this ""documentary"" 0 stars or less I would. Or, if they are interested in changing it's genre to what it truly is - fiction - then I'll reconsider my rating."
2,Spooked Review,I was a little disappointed in this. I was very excited to get my hands on this disc but when it came to watching it I was let down. I usually like the Booth Brothers work and this one film won't keep me from investigating their other stuff.
2,not the best..,When i purchased this i thought it was the same one i first watched but unfortunately it wasn't. it was more of a behind the scenes of the making of the documentry and it wasn't as good as i thought.
4,Decent quality and oh so convenient.,"Not too often you need a 20MM tap. But I did, and it was just a few clicks away here at Amazon. It's stamped 'CHINA', but what isn't these days. The machining was quite good on it though. I was able to repair some dinged up threads easily.I could not have obtained this locally at any price."
5,THE BEST FROM KYLIE'S LITTLE SIS,"THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST SINGLE CD FROM DANNII MINOGUE THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD, ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE HER ""I BEGIN TO WONDER"" SONG , I STILL THINK THAT THE ""NEVINS CLUB CREATION"" OF THIS SONG IS THE #1 ON MY LIST.I FIRST HEARD THIS SONG AND SAW THE VIDEO AT A (...) NIGHT CLUB HERE IN PALM SPRINGS AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. I TRULY RECOMEND THIS CD SINGLE TO ANYONE WHO LIKES ANYTHING FORM EITHER KYLIE OR DANNII.THEY BOTH SOUND THE SAME BUT EACH AHVE THIER OWN RYTHEM AND SOUND."
2,I feel ripped off,"I thought this was a Keak Album. This just has a few verses by him on it. The production quality on this album is horrible. I hear the samples are mixed in poorly so you can hear pops and clicks, parts of it sound like it was recorded in a bathroom.Basically this is mixtape quality. If you are really into some of these guys you may like this, but don't expect too much."
3,Farewell To The King,"This is an awesome movie, highs and lows and everything in between. Altho I bought a DVD version of the movie, it appears to be a professional copy form a VCD. Picture resoulution is no better than a VHS tape or VCD. But thats OK, I bought this to replace my worn out VHS tape. The movie is still 5 stars."
3,okay,thought it was the game as well. appeared that way online. also took over 2 weeks to arrive right before xmas.
3,"Well done, but the aspect ratios are STILL wrong","I had originally given this collection 5 stars, but then did some investigating. It turns out that although they've fixed the aspect ratios on a couple of the films, they are still wrong on Shame, Persona, and Hour of the Wolf. This effectively chops out about 12% of the films, destroying Bergman's original compositions. I didn't believe it at first until I went through scene-by-scene and realized the horrible truth.UPDATE 2012: DVDBeaver reports that MGM now ships corrected versions, though obviously I am stuck with what I have at this point. According to them, the only way to be sure is to look at the UPC code. ""The corrected MGM boxset can be identified by its UPC code and Catalog number: UPC# 0 27616 91137 7 and Catalog# 1006999. Both numbers are found on a white sticker situated over the spot where the old UPC is printed, at the bottom of the box (old UPC# 0 27616 90225 2 -- old Catalog# 1005996).""More information here: [...]"
1,They're cropped!,"MGM (USA) have made an appalling series of errors with their new Bergman boxset. Two films in the set have been heavily cropped from their original 1.37:1 aspect ratio to a very noticeable 1.66:1; and Persona is missing roughly 11.5% of screen information despite being 1.33:1. This is a faux pas the like of which has not been seen for a long time in DVD land. There is no precedent for Hour of the Wolf and Shame being 1.66:1 yet MGM seem to think that these films were shown theatrically at this ratio. With characters' heads chopped in half, Bergman and Nykvist's careful framing is ruined at 1.66:1 (the transfers are non-anamorphic too). R1 Bergman fans should strongly consider holding off this boxset.DVDBeaver's enlightening examination is clear for all to see. Either MGM will withdraw the set or suffer very poor sales. Maybe Greg Carson, the set's producer, can provide a statement on the matter?from Mastersofcinema.comgo to DVDBEAVER.com"

1,outraged,"I don't understand why you keep quoting the same paragraph in all your customer reviews of this box set. Surely there are some opinions which don't all express or lift the same paragraph from whoever. The fact that MGM has tinkered with the aspect ratio of Bergman's and cut off some of the heads of the actors is outrageous. Why Amazon is still selling this box set is amazing....without any comment from the distributor who committed this faux pas. I have bought thousands of dollars of worth of dvds from you guys...here's a review that doesn't quote that same paragraph. Save your money folks until the set is fixed. Surely, Amazon[.com] can protect us (your customers) from such disasters."
2,Great Movies....MGM sucks,"I, along with many film buffs, could not preorder this item fast enough when news came out that several of Bergman's greatest films would be released in a SE box...along with Serpent's Egg. Many of us subsequently canceled those orders when it became apparent that MGM committed one of the greatest offenses to cinema: they cropped the images of two of the films. Hour of the Wolf and Shame were filmed and intended to be viewed in full-screen Acadamy aspect ration...not widescreen as the monkeys with scissors at MGM are offering us. They claim OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) on the box and subsequent press releases: this is a lie. Numerous scenes now have feet and heads cropped. Sven Nykvist, one of cinemas greatest cinematographer, is taking it to the jaw with this travesty of a set. Again, these are great films! Irresistable to the film buff...but, please, let's send a clear message to MGM: NO! don't mess with the magic."
1,"Why Are You Still Selling This, Amazon?","Reports have it that only two of the films will be corrected by April 20th. That's Hour and Shame.Reports also have it that MGM has also recalled these two films and the box set.It's Amazon that continues to sell those two films and the box set.MGM's in the clear. They're correcting a mistake.But unless someone makes Hour of the Wolf and Shame and the box set pre-order items, then Amazon's the bad guy here."
5,"If u like Bergman, buy it, if not, why are u searching for Bergman?","I would not deem myself qualified to comment on the films included in this collection. Bergeman is a master of a certain brand of art house cinema. It's like eating fish guts. Some people like it, some people don't. If you like it, then this collection is extacy. Bergamn fans will adore it, but Bergman fans alrady know this, because we know. To the uninnitiated, watch a film like Wild Strawberries first, or Seventh Seal, or Virgin Spring, or even Fanny and Alexander. To the Bergman fans, buy this DVD collection, but you know this already, because it captures what you want. The quality is brilliant, even on HD, and the films are what they are. They are Bergman films. The medium is irrelevant. Enjoy!-n"
2,Close to useless on many fronts,"Not terrible, but don't rely on it for finding anything special.Taking a cruise to San Juan? Fine book. You will get off the boat, go to some reasonable shops, eat a good (but not cheap) meal, and do fine.Interested in a fun week outside of San Juan? Not so great. Did a fine job (although far from complete) on where to stay. Especially Paradors (gov't run hotels) were a great contribution from the book.Looking for a place to snorkel? Or for a special beach? The treasure-hunt attitude of the book (""nearby, you will find super beach with incredible snorkeling"") is useless. How about some directions and physical location? ""Nearby"" seems to encompass everything from driving down unmarked roads to hiking trash strewn trails where you sincerely hope the end of the trail is a great beach, and not a mugging. Maps were also incredibly inaccurate."
5,Great for beginners and those wanting low impact aerobics...,"This is not my favorite Kathy Smith video, but it is a very good one for beginners. It is made to get the same kind of results as a outdoor walking workout, so if that's not what you want, don't get this video.. it's low impact. I have used it because the moves are easy and the workout is fairly short. Kathy Smith has a great variety of videos, and they are always well-instructed and fun!"
5,A workout for everybody regardless of fitness level,"This is an excellent workout for beginners, intermediates, and really, anyone who wants a short, easy, straight-to-the-point workout. It's only 30 mins long, so even the busiest person should be able to fit it into their day. What I have found to be very beneficial, (if you have time and want more of a workout), is to combine this program with Kathy Smith's ""Secrets for a great body"" tapes. There's 2...one for upper body and one for lower body. I alternate them so, along with a short aerobic tape like this one, you get a good cardio and body sculpting workout. But even by itself, it's a good workout and easy on the joints."
2,"Ok tape, kind of Silly but good for older folks","This tape is not good for weight loss, but its better than nothing. I personally did not have the patients to do the tape more than twice, and I did not look foreward to doing it the second time. I reccomend her step videos and functionally fit peak fat burning, but if thats too much intensity for you than just stick to walking."
2,I'm CRYING...,"IS this JUDAS ? Lost in the glam phase of the eighties, JUDAS tried hard to accomodate themselves and gain new markets. It failed."
1,The Dark Ages...,"The year is 1985/1986. True heavy-metal has its image progressively destroyed by the gay-metal bands (call it glam if you like) like Ratt, Dokken, Cinderella, Motley Crue, Lita Ford, Poison, etc. In order not lose the ""mainstream"" and get new public and more sales, all of a sudden the great Judas Priest starts transforming theirselves in Ratt's clones, dressing like girls, using heavy make-up, coloring their hairs, playing ""sugar"" music. Thanks God they came back with the master piece Painkiller (after the less prolific Ram It Down). TURBO is the worst Judas Priest album. Period."
2,Priest Sells Out,"I've heard people say that there is no such thing as "" selling out "" This album is living proof that you indeed can sell out. How do you sell out ? You alter your sound so it reaches a larger audience . More often than not its a sweeter, less aggressive, radio (or MTV) friendly sound . Its target audience is usually younger and more female . There are actually a few good songs on this - Reckless, Locked In , Out in The Cold and even the title track isnt bad --- that is if your name happens to be Def Leppard or Bon Jovi . I find the song Parental Guidance to be particularly offensive -- "" We dont want no , no, no no parentel guidance here "" - If your name happens to be Twisted Sister this song is a work of art , if its Judas Priest ... its a joke . If you do like this album and some of the 80s priest stuff , try getting your hands on Stained Class , Sin After Sin, Sad Wings' and even Hell Bent'--thats the real Priest - dont settle for Priest lite"
4,The people trashing this album haven't listened to it enough,"I am a huge Judas Priest fan and I think this is actually a very good album. Some of the songs did have a little too much of a pop edge to them, but songs like ""Out in the Cold"", ""Hot For Love"" and ""Turbo"" definitely rock. Many of Priest's albums had a little bit of a pop sound to them, especially ""British Steel"" and ""Point of Entry"". ""Turbo"" takes a few listens before you can get used to the synth sound, but it is well worth the effort. To call this album Priest's worst album (as somebody does below) is crazy - have you heard ""Ram It Down""?!? While definitely not their best (I recommend ""Rocka Rolla"" or ""British Steel""), it is still a must have for the true, diehard Judas Priest fan. By the way, I think Priest still rocks even with their new lead singer."
1,Don't bother,"If you are a true Priest fan, you will despise this album. This is their worst album by far. The have a lot of great music. Try Screaming for Vengeance, British Steel, or Hellbent if you want something hard. Try Point of Entry or Sin After Sin for something more melodic, but pass this one up."
2,By far the worst Priest CD,"It was a sad day in my life when one of the greatest metal bands of all time released this piece. If you like pop metal with lots of synthesizers, you'll love it. Otherwise, stay away!!!"
2,The shadow of a band...,"With this album, Priest tried desperately something new just to earn more money. That's the explanation. Don't come talking about ""exploring new directions"", ""refininf their sound"", ""trying new ideas"". No. It was just a sell out to please Columbia Records and try to compete with the hair metal bands of that time (middle-eighties). As with most fo the bands that made this sell out, the result backfired: the band earned few new fans and lost a lot of the old ones, who just got angry and/or confused with the ""betrayal"".The worst of all was the changing in clothing, attitude and lyrics subjects. Unbeliavable, disgusting. Priest tried hard to sound like some cheap californian band. TURBO was their worst effort up till that point in time, and I still must flip coins to decide what album is worst, TURBO or Ram It Down. I think it's TURBO."
2,"""SORRY... WE DROPPED THE BALL ...""","This is what Judas Priest must have said to their fans after the releasing of this disappointing albun, the worst of their career ever ! To prove so, they never more played any of the songs of this album after the tour promoting it! Just that! To prove so, they released ""PAINKILLER"" after this lousy CD, to prove their fans that they still could rock, they still could deliver authentic metal ! And some fans say this CD is great! how can they say that when it's clear even the band doesn't like it at all !"
2,Not Good,"The only reason why I gave this album two stars is because Turbo Lover is a great tune! Sure its a bit cheesy, but I still like. Don't buy the album, just download Turbo Lover."
2,This still beat the hair bands of the time,"This album isn't a complete disaster it only has 3 good songs and they are Turbo Lover,Locked In,and Out On The Cold.The rest of it isn't really good at all.I am listening to Dreamer Deceiver right now.It is hard to believe that one of Heavy Metal's Best Bands could release such garbage as this.I wanna start crying because this is the same band that brought us great songs like Sinner,Dissident Aggressor,Beyond The Realms Of Death,Tyrant,Dreamer Deceiver(The Best Judas Priest Song Of All-Time!!!!!!!!!!!!).Locked In has this keyboard in the back that sounds a lot like Electric Eye.With All of that said this is still 1000 times better than the stupid hair bands of the time."
1,bad,"ok mabe 1 star is little harsh, but this album isn't very good. I like two or three songs, locked in and out in the cold are good and reckless is decent, but the rest is weak. The bad songs include private property and parental guidence, hot for love and hot summer nights (horrible)."
3,Satisfying disc,"Judas Priest's Turbo was released in 1986. There are 11 tracks. The last two are bonus cuts--""All Fired Up"" is a studio song, and the other one is a live version of ""Locked In."" Altogether, the songwriting is good, the musicianship is solid, and the sound quality is gratifying. The material is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. Guitarists Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing do a tight job throughout; their usage of guitar synthesizers is cool. Rob Halford does well with the vocals. I find all of the compositions to be satisfying, but my favorite ones are ""Turbo Lover"" and ""Out in the Cold."" The well-crafted, memorable ""Turbo Lover"" sports a pleasing intro and an impressive buildup to the notable refrain. The earnest ""Out in the Cold"" is a nicely constructed piece. The CD booklet includes the song lyrics. The disc is just over 50 minutes. Turbo is a worthy album from Judas Priest."
2,Usually I don't conform!,"Usually I don't conform to what other people think, I have my own mind, but this time priest really don't deliver the goods. A very poor album is turbo. The only decent songs here are out in the cold, reckless and maybe locked in. 1.5 stars. Parental guidance brings it down to a 1.5 star album."
5,Sucks? Whatever,This CD kicks [butt] the people trashing this CD are stupid morons. This is their most melodic CD. GET IT
3,Could have been better,"The other reviews are right. This CD has a very different feel/sound to it than any other Judas Priest CD, and it only comes off really well in a couple of the tracks. Turbo Lover is by far the best of them with an intensity that slowly builds as the song plays. Parental Guidance is a song I've liked for years, but didn't know it was a Judas Priest song because it sounds so different from other well-known tracks by this artist. Beyond those two, the rest of the songs don't really stick out in my mind as anything special. If you can, get these tracks on a greatest hits cd and don't worry about missing out on the rest of this disc."
2,Not their best work,"I only have this album to complete the collection. I really don't care much for it at all. I didn't like it when it came out the first time.I bought the remaster only because I bought the whole damn set.this is one disc that gets ignored.If you're a Priest fan you understand...this is commercial crap.If you wish to 'sample' Priest by Hell Bent for Leather or ""Sin Stained Class"". Classics."
4,Not as cheesy as I remember,"I was 17 when this album came out and a full blown ""metal head"". I thought that this was not the real Priest. They had sold out with the synth guitars and poppy sound. I hated it. Well, some twenty years later I have changed my mind somewhat. This is a great pop-metal album! Fun to sing along to the lyrics of Locked In and Rock You All Around The World. The ballad Out In The Cold is epic. Different sound for Priest but it's still pretty cool. Worthy of adding to your collection, in my opinion."
3,Glam Metal,"Ths is an under rated album by Priest because it is viewed as a sell out. Went platinum on name recognition alone. The songs are much more pop oriented, using synth guitars and processed vocals. Still, not a bad album but their age was starting to show."
3,"Judas Priest goes softer, but still rocks","I remember when the ""Turbo Lover"" video first aired on MTV. I liked the little skeletons and the British girl with the big beautiful bouncy butt as she chased a rolling motorcycle tire. I thought the song was good and I thought Glenn had a cool flamethrower on his guitar.Locked In, Parental Guidance, and Private Property were the other singles off the album, Locked probably being the most well known, and heaviest. The other two were a softer and OBVIOUSLY looking for radio airplay. Out in the Cold is a great tune, I would call it a lost classic.I think my favorite song on the album is 'Rock you all Around the World'. It's just a great tune to drive to and has a great sing a long chorus. It's just a song to unite all Priest and metal fans."
4,Not Thier Best But Still Good,"This was the album where Tipton and Downing started using guitar synthesizers. I think they pulled it off pretty good, but for the metal purist, they may come off as a bit ""disco-y.""This is by no means their heaviest, or their most brilliant, but it is still good rock and has some decent songs on it. I think Turbo is by far the most prominent here, with Parental Guidance coming in a close second.This is good metal, with a flair for electronics and they did a decent job. I'll continue to play the album when the mood strikes and I recommend it."
4,Some fine tunes on Turbo,"Turbo by Judas Priest is one of those albums in which you either love it, or just plain can't stand it and think those who do like it are nuts. Personally i think it's a good album. Especially to add to your JP collection. It's a totally different sound compared to albums such as Point of Entry. The songs on Turbo are upbeat and clean, most have synthesizer mixes in some of the tracks, but still have great vocals by Halford and great sound. ""Locked In"" is a great song along with ""Parental Guidance"". The best and hardest hitting song on Turbo is ""Reckless"". It's a classic heavy metal song with great licks, and might be worth buying just for the one song itself. I say buy it and enjoy a new sound by Judas Priest."
1,I'm YOUR TURBO PRIEST DESTROYER...,"PRIEST fought hard to come back after this disgraceful album. It was necesary to release a petard called PAINKILLER to make real fans forget this album, the one when Judas tried hard to compete with hair metal..."
4,not priests bes defintily,theres where priests bad song writting habits beginturbo lover castchy poppy tunewarning loked in has some of the dumbest worst lyrics ever cool guitars but omg terrible klyruics private proberty cheesey lyrics but ver catchy parentel guidance very fun song the rest of the album varies not classic priest att all
4,Very good! ... they shall listen to in again!,"1986: Turbo.If most of the Judas Priest fans hate this album, I do believe it's one of their best... for me, it's easily better than ""Defenders of the faith"" and ""Sad Wings of destiny"".Of course, it's not the heavy metal Judas Priest we were used to listen to in the 70's, but it's a great pop metal album, with excellent songs such as ""Out in the cold"", and my favourite song from the band, ""Locked In"", ultra-energetic power ballad like bands used to do in the mid 80's, which is also featured as a live bonus track on the remastered version...I think it's worth the money, cause it'll blow your mind!"
1,HÁ!!! I,"Well, any ""average"" PRiest fan knows that TURBO was Priest's lowest point in their career. Trying desperately to go with the times (the times being hair-metal, glam and pop metal - blergh!, Priest dressed themselves like POison and MOtley Crue, added an obnoxious drums sound, wrote cliched ""girls and fun"" lyrics, and released this piece of junk. That's the truth."
2,Victim Of Changes,"That is what the Priest became when they decided to follow the trends, in lieu of leading the trends as they once did quite well. I remember buying this (tape) album the day it came came out in the summer of 1986, and I could not believe the the sounds emitting from the speakers. Thankfully, the tape did not contain pictures - so it was the videos that brought the full horror into focus.This album was synth drenched pop-syrup, polished to the point of sounding more like Fine Silver than Heavy Metal.I would recommed this album only to die hard Priest fans who would buy any body of their work - irrespective of excrement therein.I have re-purchased all the Preist albums....and I buy the current Priest & Halford catalogues, but I can not bring myself to buying ""Turbo"" or ""Ram It Down."""
3,Enjoy music for what it is.,"Let's face it. There is a quick slippery slope from Judas Priest to the Pet Shop Boys. GASP! What did he say? Yep, pop, rock, metal, punk, they are all the same. Synths are just have cultural connotations. If this album is good, and it seems to be fairly consistent, then enjoy. It was 1986, land of West End Girls and East End Boys, a Land Of Confusion. Am I making sense? Who knows. I just find it odd how the Priest started all the metal cliches, and they all came out of gay culture, and yet, I, who am straight, listen to gay pop, and always get accosted for doing such. ELO had a synth period, it was great, but even Jeff Lynee hates himself for it. Aah, pop culture and shame. Now everyone get out your Casio, turn it to synth strings, and play some chords. There, don't you feel better now?"
3,"weak, but the good is great","Even though it's understandable that Priest fans would hate this album, because after all it IS a softer and more commercial album, there are three fantastic songs on this bad boy. Those would be ""turbo lover"" ""locked in"" and ""reckless"". VERY melodic and good songs. The rest of the album has some above average bits here and there, but mostly forgettable.I have to admire this album because it takes me back to my childhood in the mid 80's. The loud guitars remind me of my parents driving me around on back roads back then. Sometimes memories can help improve an albums quality. Also, to the albums defense, it's STILL quite heavy."
3,Tisk Tisk Tisk... What a dissapointment.,"I got this album, listened to it, and It sounded a lot like ""White Wedding"" of Billy Idal(at least ""Turbo Lover"" did).And of course ""Rock You All Around The World"" is the most BIZZARsong I have ever heard on earth! Since when do metal bands mention ""rock n' roll"" in their albums?And an other thing; In the re-masters pack 17 bonus tracks out of the 24 are live tracks which apear on the albums. So most of the remaining 7 are balladics, but this album contains a nice bonus track that makes the album worth replacing the original."
2,Candy flavored,"I didn't find much to like on this album.The term,experimental album which is the way this album was marketed is a cover up what it really is;a sellout.Turbo is an album that actually sounds more like a Rob Halford side project rather than Judas Priest.It seems as if Priest wanted to be ""hip"" and be part of the pop metal craze that was going on in 1986 and altered their sound to any degree necessary in order to get their stamp on the current trend.The synth/pop melodies were way too strong and the lyrics to""Parental Guidance"" were so cheesy that it was comical hearing Rob's vocals singing such commercial crap.I had no problem with Priest changing the formula just a bit,but on Turbo it was way too much.Out of all the 80's Judas Priest albums made,this is one to avoid.It would take at least two more albums before Judas Priest would return to form and make the fans forget about this horrible pop metal experience gone bad."
2,POOFFY HAIR AND MAKE UP!!,"Just watch the PRIEST...LIVE vhs and you'll understand the sudden, abrupt and nosense transformation this band suffered for the TURBO album and the subsequent tour. Watching Halford, Downing, TIpton and the rest dressed that way shocked me forever.... Also, in the video, we've got constant shot at pretty girls in the audience...Also sad was the fact that a band capable of writing lyrics about different subjects focused all their capabilities in writing obnoxious cliched lyrics typical of hair metal bands, with the old themes of partying forever, getting the girls, bla, bla, bla... this for the same band that wrote VICTIM OF CHANGES and LAST ROSE OF SUMMER... I still do not believe."
3,"Not Bad, Just Not What Some Expected","The songs 'Turbo Lover' and 'Out In The Cold' are worth the price of admission alone. 'Turbo Lover' has a powerful, lurking and indeed lustful menace with one of the best uses of guitar synths you'll ever hear. With the line ""I spy like no other"" you'll get a shiver up your spine from the grinding beat and guitar riff right up til the first chorus. 'Out In The Cold' is in the best tradition of Priest power ballads, but has a unique stamp all it's own. Some metal fans and music critics have implied Judas Priest were trawling for commercial success with this album. While that MAY have been part of their agenda here, I prefer to look upon ""Turbo"" as actually being an exercise in artistic growth. And as usual for artists who try to stretch their boundaries; some of the audience resist change, moaning that THEY know better. My actual rating is 3.5 stars."
2,BY FAR THE LESS INSPIRED...,"From ALL Priest albuns, this is the less inspired...i think this even sound like GLAM rock,with some of the most juvenile lyrics ever and the Priest menbers clothes were REALLy embarassing by this time...TURBO LOVER, LOCKED IN, OUT IN THE COLD and RECKLESS are ok songs, but i really don't care for TURBO as a album at all..."
2,OK,"This book is for young children. I thought it had to do with animation but was disappointed. They should take to word animation out of the title. Yes the goggly eyes move, I guess that is what they mean for animation."
5,Fiction? Yes/No?,"Although I love Christian Novels and enjoyed this book, I can see that fiction can have a way of the bringing truth out. I've read this book, and up until I re-read Revalations I was totally captivated by the PTR doctorine that has polluted the Bible. There isn't a shred of scripture (not even a word) that supports this doctorine anywhere in the KJV or NIV Bible. There isn't even a piece of scripture to support post-trib either, but all is present to support mid-trib. I don't agree this should be the guide to the end times, but rather much prayer and study of the Bible.WAP"
3,Ups and downs,"This book is like an _Onion_ for the head-shrinking field, and, like the _Onion_, it has pieces that work, and pieces that don't. The ones that do are hilarious; the ones that don't are embarrassing. Recommended for psych students and those with a strong interest in the topic.. others might be a little nonplussed"
1,No music videos,"No music videos like beavis and butthead of old. episodes are short,chopped up and everything good is censored. Save your money."
4,Funny,"Innocence lost is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing on some of the episodes. Chicks n Stuff wasn't as funny in my opinion, but overall a good DVD that I enjoyed very much."
4,interesting,"I usually don't like techno stuff, but am a serious fan of Cuban music. This is a mix of both genres. If you are wanting to learn about Cuban music, this may not be the record you want. But if you already know enough, this is very interesting and actually quite pleasant. The techno aspect is done very tastefully."
3,A good latin - like european album,"Mano Negra's people, whitouth Manu Chao, are now P18 (district 18, Paris) and they improve a good CD with some typical latin sounds (and words) and, obviously, their ""home made"" european culture, mixed with a not perfectly designed ""revolutionary"" profile. In short: listen it, you will enjoy their effort (and, please, be compassiote with my English: I am doing my best ;-)"
4,World Music for the Millenium,"All over the world (I'm french but I know it's the same in America), people like more and more world music because you can directly escape your life of stress, work and technology (Internet for example!). And salsa is one of the most exiting music with reggae to discover new sensations of freedom and exotism. P18 is a really great band because it mixes cuban and jamaican music with new technologies. You can hear drum'n'bass mixed with trumpet, then big beat with salsa, percussions with techno. It is excellent !!! It is a cuban and french band from Paris.I suggest you to listen to them now or an other band which is called Sergent Garcia."
5,Creating Breathing Room,This book has been a valuable tool in creating financial breathing room for myself. If your looking for a resource to kick start you this is it.
3,good,This is a good starter book on how to be more focused on correct ways to improve your finances. It is enjoyable to discuss with a spouse.
5,Financial Peace Revisited,"This book is an enjoyable easy read, Dave Ramsey describes his own financial downfall and how he and his wife rebuild their lives. Best advise I have ever seen anyone give to all of their readers. I could not put the book down, I strongly suggest you pass the book down to younger generations so that they can learn how to be debt free and have money for retirement. He makes it so simple anyone can do it!!"
4,Classic Money Management Advice,"Dave's advice stands the test of time. After reading his books I truly made-over my financial lifestyle. I don't agree with him fully - I think credit cards can be a valuable asset if used correctly, but if you pay attention to his core points, you can really gain traction in the battle with your finances."
4,Financial Peace Revisited Helps in Understanding Husband,"Financial Peace Revisted is an easy to read well-organized book with lots of helpful suggestions on financial management. While our families finances are fortunately in good shape, I found that reading the book helped me to understand strongly held views of my husband which I had not always agreed with or understood. The mis-understandings would most frequently be highlighted during discussions of how to help less fortunate members of my family. Thus the insights on dealing with different financial management ideas between marriage partners, and the chapter ""Family, Friends and Money"" were particularly helpful. I also appreciated the linkage beteen our money management approach and our spirtual life."
4,Surprisingly un-put-downable!,"I've never been very interested in finance books, and I was sure this would bore me to tears. I was surprised to discover that I couldn't put this down! I got some great ideas from this book, which is filled with common-sense advice that you can't dispute. It helped my husband and I to become better savers and we came up with a budget that has been working for us.The downside of this book was that it was laced with religious undertones that I found annoying. Although I cringed everytime he started in, I was able to get past them and did enjoy the book despite them. If you're religious, this aspect will add to your reading experience. If you're not religious, don't let it ruin the book for you, because it really is full of great information."
4,A Good Primer On How To Relate To Money,"Great guide on how to relate with money. Good primer for the much more useful ""Total Money Makeover"" book. I think you'll find the Total Money Makover much more useful when you are looking for the nuts and bolts on how to best manage your finances. Financial Peace does an excellent job of setting a good financial foundation upon which you can set the more utilitarian principles laid out in this book's sequel. A good read, but people may wish to skip directly to The Total Money Makeover."
5,Great advice,This is a great book for getting out of debt and learning how to be a good steward of your money. It's simply written and you don't have to be an accountant or tax lawyer to understand it. I am using the principles to get my financial situation in order. It also has both male and female perspectives along with some humor.
5,You'll never regret getting your finances in order,"Dave Ramsey is a special financial adviser in the way that his advice focuses on changing financial management behavior first and then getting into the more in-depth details later.There are many reviews and descriptions here, so I'll keep my thoughts on this simple: check out the book, take the program, and you will not regret it. This works if you apply it from my experience and the experiences of those I know who took the class. This isn't a quick fix: it'll take you a couple months to get the hang of things and some time after that to get your finances in order.If you're serious about changing your financial future, you should really take the class, too. It's cheap and they are conducted throughout the country."
5,How to survive any personal economic downturn.,I like Ramsey's complete honesty in dealing with his personal experiences in dealing with his personal financial disaster before using Biblical methods to financial freedom.
5,Hayman,"THis book gives great financial advice, if you are smart enough to follow it. The examples are getting a little dated, but the information is the same."
4,recommended reading,The first 4-5 chapters were good but for the most part not new to me. After the 5th chapter is when I really start to learn and don't want to put the book down.
3,Good overview..,"- this book is good but i've heard som of it before - but if this is your first financial book, it's worthwhile - everyone should just follow their passions - check out Live Like A Fruit Fly (also on amazon)"
5,Great planning and strategy,I like the fact that Dave is conveying a Christian viewpoint on money. He is helping normal people gain financial independence using simple techniques. His ideas are better than any government program to save money and grow wealth. Thanks Dave.
5,Best Financial Book Ever!!!,A must read for anyone even if you think you financial life is ok!!! It changed my life.
5,Financial self-help -- you can do it!,My husband and I started this 2 years ago and have since paid off all our credit cards and our auto loan. Relatively easy reading. The chapter on investing is tricky if you are not familiar with any investment terminology. There is a Christian viewpoint to the writing. I just bought a copy for a wedding gift for my sister and it would also be good for a graduation gift. Recommend to anyone wanting to get out of debt!
3,Overall Financial Peace View,"This book is a good first step towards Financial Peace. This book explains an overview of Dave's history, and how to find Financial Peace. Ramsey's next book ""Total Money Makeover"" explains in more detail HOW to find Financial Peace.This book is written as a high-level primer on how you'll proceed towards a debt-free life. It's not needed if you visit www.daveramsey.com or listen to Dave's radio show, but serves it's purpose."
2,was not the book shown,"The book I received was not the edition shown the picture, which I was very disappointed with. The shipment was very quick, received my book 2 days later."
2,Great Book for Rich Morons,"This book is a life saver for all those rich idiots out there that have plenty of money but are just stupid with it. It will give them a small bit of common sense so that they will finally get out of debt like they should have been all along. If you are a rich idiot, buy this book! On the other hand, if you actually have some common sense, you will be able to figure these things out for yourself and are probably in debt because you actually have some real problems, like you need a better job. But hey, I bet you could just write a crappy book and make plenty of money like this guy."
1,Dave Ramsey's advice is completely unrealized,"When Dave Ramsey can live off of $24,000.00 a year, and have a family, then perhaps I can listen to him. His advice of paying for everything in cash starts off great.However, I believe in putting my family first. That does not include getting two or three jobs to pay off debt, and make my family suffer; no way! Dave claims to be a religious man, and if that were the case, he would realize that the Bible says that family comes before the love of money (as well as a few other things)And finally, the man makes hundreds of thousands a year. I just can't follow the words of someone who does that and expects normal people to live."
2,"Unless you are an absolute beginner, don't waste your money!","Robert Irwin writes in general terms about things that are common sense to anyone who knows a screwdriver from a hammer. This book is strictly for someone that has not even purchased a house before. One last note; If you do buy this book, buy it from Amazon.com because it cost me four dollars more at my local book store!"
2,Sad way to end,"As most people know, this was the last album of original material ever issued by this outstanding American rock and roll outfit. Thanks to the fact that bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford had decided to demand equal time for their own songwriting and vocal contributions, this stands as far and away the weakest album in the band's catalog. With Mardi Gras best tracks (""Someday Never Comes"" and ""Sweet Hitch-hiker"", both John Fogerty songs) available on any number of CCR hits packages, there really isn't any reason to own this dud unless you're just trying to collect all the band's original releases."
3,"Not ""The Gravy""","There was a great band that started in the '90s and continued into the 2000s called THE GRAVY, and for fans of that band: THIS ISN'T THE SAME BAND. ""The Gravy"" and ""Gravy"" should get together and work stuff out maybe!"
1,"Not worth the money, even at the discounted Amazon price","Book is 17 yrs old so the information on commercial products is obsolete. Zero information on construction of Japanese paper darts. No information on construction of mylar cones. No mention of US or international blowgun associations. No mention of sports competition rules. Photographs are poor quality. Construction projects lack adequate detail. Better information available for free on the net. I've pre-ordered a copy of Blowgun Techniques: The Definitive Guide to Modern and Traditional Blowgun Techniques by Amante P. Marinas Sr. and Hironori Higuchi Ph.D... Hopefully it will provide better detail and current information. Will post a review when received in June. In the interim, don't waste your money on this book; use Google instead."
5,Don't Judge This Book By it's Cover,"This is a good book, although it needs some updating and editing. Come to think of it alot of Lee's books do. Nonetheless, there are many pearls of wisdom, and I would argue this is one of his better books. Why a living teacher and not a dead one? The do's and don'ts of spiritual practice, there is plenty of good advice here. ""Dead Guru's can't kick it!"" How true, although I believe Franklin Jones was the originator of the expression. Unfortunately, Franklin was a little too literal with that one. There are plenty of original revelations here though. Reactional Enquiry is a humorous, adaptation of Ramana Maharishi's question; ""Who am I?"" Now, It is: ""Who am I kidding ! Order this book, Don't kid yourself this is a 3000% Potent Teaching. I'd Love to see a Millenial revised and updated postmodern cutting edge cover. Maybe with Sri Yogi Ramsuratkumar on the cover(Hint)!"
5,It worked,"Had purchased some of these from Brookstone, for a previous trip to India, and those stopped working quite quickly. My husband purchased these for his latest trip to India and no complaints. We're glad to have finally found something that works!"
5,Super Snow Scooper,"Prior to ordering, I had seen this snow scooper one other time. I spent two years searching for one in my local stores. Amazon.com made it simple and easy for me to purchase this wonderful tool. I can say that scooping nearly 2 feet of snow is so much easier with the Suncast Snow Scooper! A great product!"
5,Very effective push shovel,"This really does work well. When you first use it it doesn't seem like much. But as you get the hang of using it like a plow and wheelbarrow, you begin to realize how much less effort you have to use to push things around."
5,good for short person,"After researching online, this product looked like it would work for my needs. I'm a 5'2"" approx 115 lb female. And I do all the shoveling at my house. I live on a corner so have approximately 200 feet of sidewalk to shovel. My driveway is about 20 feet wide by 50 feet long. The suncast big scoop helps me get the job done without having to lift and heave lots of snow. As earlier reviewers indicated, the best way to use it is to create a mound at the end point so that the scoop can slide onto that mound before you tip it to empty it. We got 8 inches of snow last week and I got the shoveling done in about 45 min. Good workout of course.I've only used it three times, and I'm hoping it lasts through this winter and a few more to come."
2,Good Only In Principle,"Well, it looks good, right? Big wide mouth to gather up the snow. However, there is a reason old fashioned snow shovels were made as they were: you gotta get rid of the snow once the mouth/shovel is full. With the ""handles"" on the side of the unit, pitching the snow off of a drive or a sidewalk is awkward at best. I end up pushing as much snow as possible forward, filling the mouth up, and then kicking the back of the shovel to get rid of the snow off of the path. In the meantime, you leave a film of snow behind you, perfect for slipping on and the like, as you can't really dig in with this shovel. Don't waste your bucks, folks."
4,the scoop,"it is good, except the handle is mounted too low, and cannot be adjusted. it it fine if you are 5 ft 2"""
2,tried several specialty products,"I tried this product and another type of pusher that had a small wheel under the front edge. The problem with them, is when the snow is heavy or deep you cant (like with some other products) lift or throw the snow to get the piles high enough or off the area you want cleared (so the piles kept creeping out and I had to shovel them into taller piles). So it was ok for a few inches of snow but not great if you have to really move the snow where it is piling up.."
4,Scooping the NE Blizzard,"I innaugurated my new Suncast Scoop after the Dec Blizzard of 2010. Worked well despite the deep 15 inches of snow. I wondered if this short female would be able to move the heavy wet stuff. It required a bit of extra leg push to move the snow beyond the mounds, but was much easier than the lifting required by a standard shove."
4,easy on the back,I used the big scoop snow shovel on a snow fall of about 5 inches and it worked great. I'm anxious to try it on a heavier snowfall. I think if you use a little common sense and don't try to move too much snow at a time the product will be outstanding.
5,It's not a shovel - it's better!,"The thing you have to get used to is thinking of this as a snow sled rather than a snow shovel. The big scoop allows you to pack 40 lbs of soggy, heavy snow in one run. Then you just tip it up a bit and glide this heavy load across the top of the snow to your dumping spot. Once you get there, you just jerk back quickly to pull the scoop out from under the snow, like a magician pulling a tablecloth from under the dishes on a table. It helps to jerk back while the snow still has forward momentum.Ideally, you should plan your paths so that you're always transporting the snow downhill to your dump spot. You can pile successive dumpings up to build a ramp, if you need to. This is so much more effective at moving snow quickly that I can't imagine having to go back to using just a regular shovel. You can use this to quickly supply lots of snow for building an excellent snow fort too."
3,It's OK I Guess...,"I have tried a couple of products like this but they are still just pushers..it can't make high piles without hand shoveling, and in deep snow you need to be able to throw not just push. My neighbor got a Wovel and I tried that and am sort of kicking myself as it solves both these problems and also has a large oversized blade. But this Suncast is pretty good for light powdery snow...not really designed for the tougher conditions..luckily we dont get too many tough conditions here.. At least this one in medium snow you can tip it up, but in heavy snow it is both tough to push the snow and tough to lift it. There are some shovels with little wheels but I didnt even try them - they seem like they would reduce the friction of pushing but then to throw you are still lifting. If someone has tried one and knows first hand on those, post a comment..."
2,Great - for a 10 yr old,"while writing this the only other poor reviews lamented the size. I agree. I am tall, but not a giant, and the handle comes up to mid thigh. Ideally this would be up to waist at least. So who can use it would be those who are much shorter than even average, or kids. Good concept - bad design. The steel ones are better or the avalanche ergo snow scoop."
4,So much Easier!,"I have been moving snow since the mid 1970's as a small kid and still to this day I enjoy it. Out in Colorado we are lucky to get low water content snow and with the SF1820 scoop it's a brezze to move 15""+ of powder. With heavier snow, just take smaller swaths and off it goes. It glides over dirt, grass, concrete, pavement, paver stone with ease. Only problem so far wiht 1 of 2 I have is the wear strip has come loose; just needs a good smackin' to seat it."
5,Great for larger surface areas,"Love it! This product allows me to shovel across the wide surface area in front of our garage and down the driveway. The drive is gravel, and by tilting slightly, one can grab the snow without digging into the gravel. Once it is full, just tilt the handle down and slide the shovel to where where you want to drop the snow. With this tilt feature, it makes it easy to 'flip' the front edge up on a high curb and dump with minimal effort without having to pick up the entire load as you would with traditional shovels. I am tall - and this is much easier on my back.I tend to load it up - so it can be a little heavy to dump. But this would be easily fixed by not scooping so much to start with. So I can't find a single complaint."
2,Poorly designed,"I bought this scoop because it was the only one I could find (why is there a shortage of these on the market?). I'm 6'4"" and pushing on a level surface, the handle rests on the top of my kneecaps. This means to push snow up a hill, I have to bend over even further. The sides and back of this also aren't as high as I'd like. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because it's made in the US."
3,Sometimes helpful,"This shovel is good if you have room to push the snow off your sidewalk or driveway. Once the snow piles up on the sides, you need to go back to a regular shovel. The Scoop doesn't allow you to lift the snow, just push it."
3,Better than a shovel,"I already own a couple of snow scoops, but one is wearing out, so I ordered the Suncast. As mentioned by others, the handle isn't high enough and the scoop capacity is low compared to the other two I have. The blade is good for scraping the the snow that sticks to the sidewalk and driveway."
2,Suncast Snow Scoop,"Sccop works well but handle is too short for me and I'm only 5'9"". If handle was longer I would be rating this product as 5-star. However, I purchased this in hopes of it being a back saver. With the short handle it is far from that."
4,Not for tall people,"My older ""Garant"" type shovel finally broke after about 8 years so, I decided to save some money and took a gamble on this one. For the money, it is well constructed and should give good service. It moves snow much easier than lifting and tossing, but, I wish they had designed the handle to accomodate taller people, and I should have spent the extra money on the garant. I can recommend this shovel to anyone under 5' 10"" or so."
5,This is my favorite snow shovel,"After many years of use i needed to replace my suncast snow scoop shovel. February 2011I have been using a big scoop for the past 15 years. This is my 3rd big scoop purchase. But it is my second Suncast scoop. The handle design is alot stronger than my first brand that i bought.This scoop can handle my 65 foot walkway and 2 car driveway.Also able to remove what the snow plow leaves at the end of my driveway with no problem. I grab a big scoop, tilt it back, use it as a sled to where i want to dump it. Usually a snow ramp i make over the snowbank across the street(a Wooded area not the neighbors yard). No lifting involved.Just remember to use Newton's Law of motion to get snow off the shovel.""A object in motion stays in motion.""WHen emptying the scoop from a brisk pace stop short, and the snow keeps going. The empty scoop is ready for the next pass.This is my favorite snow shovel.Love my scoop"
5,Suncast SF1850 22 inch Big Scoop Shovel,"This is a great product. Well engineered and designed to move a lot of snow without straining your back. It is light weight and easy to push even with a lot of snow. Have used this now for over four years and highly recommend it. No need for any plows with wheels, this product slides easily and allows easy manuevering."
1,disppointed,Very disppointed. The handle broke off after the three time using the product. It was not what I was expecting! :-(
5,As snow shovels go!,"This reminder of the Norwegian ""Skufa"" moves a lot of snow with very little effort. When full, it slides over the ground without having to be lifted, and ""dumps"" by raising the handle. However, not good on stairs!"
1,Not the best choice,"I just returned this shovel after finding that the handle was way too low and awkward to use (I'm 5'8"") and the scoop area was small, compared to the scoop I'm now using, which is the Avalanche Ergo:http://www.amazon.com/Ames-True-Temper-Sleigh-1600900/dp/B000KL2WG4/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_tThe Ergo's handle has 3 possible heights - literally just a snap to change.Sorry Suncast!"
5,Joelifter,This snow scoop works great! The key is to not try to push too much snow. When the scoop gets full or heavy push it on top of the snow turn around and go in the other direction. A real time saver.
5,Functional and stylish too,"I have contemporary tastes and was looking for something stylish. I bought the set Amco has that is called ""Galaxy"" -- comes with one pick with the design above and also comes with a lightning bolt, flat spiral and flat open star. All look great in the glass and hold the fruit well. The stainless steel will last a long time. The only think I would add is that it would be great to see this in a yellow gold too (if the finish would hold up to liquor)."
1,For teens only...,"From the great reviews I've read and dance being my passion, I thought this would be a good book. Just from the first paragraph of the first page, I really can't stand this book. I forced myself to read at least five pages and just can't read any more. The reason being at least to me is that unless your still a teen in high school or you like ""High School Musical"", don't waste your money. The author of this book sounds like they're still in high school their self, it's not very well written, and I feel I just wasted four bucks. Guess I should have got a sample first because I've already deleted it from my Kindle."
4,ballet verite,"An entertaining and well crafted look at the excitment, grace, glamour and underbelly of the ballet world - written by someone who seems to know that world intimately. An interesting plot mixed with a sly sense of humor. I learned alot of backstage info I had no idea was part of the world of ballet. Reads like a movie - very enjoyable."
1,trash,"Ok, I expected this book to be sexual, but not like this. The first section of the book talks about communication with your long-distance romance. There are instructions on keeping the relationship through letters. The rest of the book are the author's (and other's) own fantasies to use as ""inspiration."" Too much for me. I couldn't continue to read them and threw the book away. If that's what you want, great, but there just wasn't enough information listed about this book to know what I was getting."
4,Nice product but!,"Nice product, very well built but quite a bit larger than I expected. Finding a spot under the dash may be an issue but I'll figure it out."
1,Battery died too quickly.,"After 1 year the battery was dead. When I first installed it, I tested it by disconnecting my car's battery, and it worked great and immediately triggered the alarm. 1 year later, I tried it again and nothing. Oh well."
1,Ugliest boots I've ever seen,"I didn't notice it when looking at the online pictures, but these boots were the ugliest things I've ever put on my feet, and I am no high-end shoe wearer. Honestly, they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid. Thankfully, I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on, I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer. Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge."
1,Bad Shoes,My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes. Not a small hole but it went all the way across. And in both shoes. Not put together right. Very disappointed. To much money to fall apart!!!!!!!!
4,Buy a half-size larger than usual.,I wish I had seen the 1/2 size larger recommendation. Mine are 1/2 size too small! Nice boots though.
1,Columbia Razor Ridge,I found these to be less than comfortable. The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour.
3,Not bad for $19.79,"I bought them 1/2 a size larger than normal and they fit fine. They will be good pair of boots to get dirty without feeling bad, how can you go wrong for $19.79."
2,don't burn well.,"i was really looking forward to these candles - the fragrance is amazing - like a smoky fireplace. but they burn terribly! this is an expensive candle. i burned it for 6 hours the other day, and it coned, like a candle does if you only burn it for an hour and then blow it out. i kept it lit all day because i thought it would work itself out. I've never seen a good quality candle do this before. now i have to cut away the wax on the side, or the candle won't stay lit for more than 20 mins. very disappointed in archipelago. i always thought they were nice quality."
3,Do You Want To Know Why He Doesn't Know Your Name?,"He doesn't know your name, Alicia, because when you called him up you introduced yourself as the ""waitress at the coffee house on 39th and Lenox, you know that, one with the braids."" That was stupid. You should've just told him that your name was Alicia. Other than that, the song is pretty good."
2,Music is Good but the Voice is YIKES!!!!!,"Nothing on an Alicia Keys, Album is Original&Everybody takews from the Past,Present,etc.. but she seems to jack everything in sight.in fact to me she is like Female Version of Lenny Kravitz, in that there Influences are all over them like Body Spray. this Song has a Nice 70's feel to it&the arrangements are nice but alicia Keys can't find the Roberta Flack, Range She is lacking or the Early Michael Jackson, ,vibe of Soul she lacks.also she trys to vibe on a Chaka Khan, tip but can't get there either along with Gladys Knight,. she doesn't show me alot of vocal Range."
4,Disco Heaven,"Disco Heaven 01.04 is a treat for the ears! Filled with big diva vocals and lots of disco beats! Highlights include Jaque's cover of ""Love Will Save The Day"", ATFC feat Inaya Day on ""Mine"", Sara Devine's ""Take me Home"", Sounds of Blackness ""I Believe"", Peyton ""A HIgher Place"", Shara Nelson ""Down That Road"", Inaya Day ""Keep Pushin"", Tee ""Take Me AwaY"", and many others. Check it out!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I might be the only person left still using an Xbox, but I would like to warn anyone else considering this purchase against buying these controllers. I have two, and their responsiveness is poor, even when sitting six feet away with direct, unobstructed line-of-sight to the transmitter/receivers. Also, they tend to lose their connection regularly, especially if you are using more than one. There is no option to set them to transmit to a certain sub-channel, leading to confusion over who is who when they reconnect (you may start as player 1 and end up as player 2). If they weren't so cheap, I would return them, but there isn't much else left in the way of wireless controllers for the ""old"" Xbox."
2,The 39 Steps,"I've seen Hichcocks's ""The 39 Steps"" several times in theatres and an on TV. This has got to be one of the worst transfers of a classic movie that I've come across. I'm not a neophyte on this. I've got well over 700 films on tape and dvd. The sound is muddy, the images are soft in some areas and Synergy Entertainment keeps putting its name on the lower corner of the screen. Is this a 5th generation copy? I made the mistake of falling for the low price. You get what you pay for."
4,"Nicely machined, including the adapter plate","These guides are accurately machined. The set includes two lock rings and an adapter plate for larger routers including the Makita 3612. The molded fitted plastic case is adequate, not the sort of cheap cardboard insert supplied with the Porter Cable set."
2,Not practical.,"The video has some good ideas, butmostly I found it on the slow side and there are unrealistic situations such as several scenes where sex acts are performed in a public park. I'm no prude, but I found some of those scenes laughable."
3,Old School Techno,"Hey kids,This is probably one of the first house albums to be on the market. I cannot say it is the best or my favorite but I come back to it again and again. My favorite song on the album is Salsa House. Of course, D-Mob Trnace Dance and Acieed are good and where played in the clubs during the early '90's for a while. 'Here comes that sound' is catchy and I usually play that over and over along with 'One for the Burglar'. All in all, if you are collecting House music, this is a good starting place or an addition to the collection."
1,LETS GO MAP GUIDE HONG KONG,"If you are planning to live in Hong Kong for the next three years do not count on this map guide to help you get around. It shows only very limited, touristy portions of the SAR. I deem it a total waste of money."
2,REALLY REALLY SALTY. And many crumbles.,"For the price, its just barely ok...for some reason, these crackers are *REALLY SALTY*. And I don't mean ""RITZ"" crackers, I mean *THESE* crackers. I have purchased Ritz crackers for years from many places but for some reason the ones in these shipments seem to contain 3-5x more salt.It is so salty that my gf can not eat them at all and was about to throw them away; but I like salty so I don't mind them..Also, due to packaging, many of the ones especially in the boxes packed on the outside came quite crumbly/broken.All around, just barely okay in my book....straight to the trash in my girlfriend's book....so I gave it a 2star."
5,nom nom nom,"These are the best crackers available. Every time I start a new stack, I cannot stop myself from finishing it. These go great with tuna for a light snack. Definitely something every pantry should have."
4,Good crackers to have on hand,This is a reliable cracker to have on hand for snacks- either by itself or with toppings on or with it.
4,Makes Hostel look like a Disney Film!,"This film is SICK. That is meant to be a compliment. Frontiers takes place after riots in Paris force a group of people out of the city. They arrive at what looks like a scene out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. From there, you know things will only get bad. Very bad. One of the most Violent films i've come across. This film was banned from the 8 films to Die for as it was too violent. If you enjoy horror films as much as I do this is a MUST SEE! Samuel Le Bihan of Brotherhood of the Wolf is Awesome as is Maud Forget! Awesome film!"
4,"At last, a French film worth watching.","This is an outstanding film for those of you who enjoy your blood and gore supersized. This is a dark story that is a cross between Hostel and House of a Thousand Corpses. It's about an evil inbred family led by a grandfather who is a veteran of the WWII Nazi regime who seek people to add to their stockpile of human flesh that they eat. This story line gets even better when the family decides that the female that they have captured is just what they have been looking for to expand their inbred gene pool. The only downfall of the movie is that it is in French with Enlish sub-titles, however, the action in this movie kept me glued to the screen. Good story line.Great cinematography!"
3,Not bad,"This is a good movie for any horror fan, lots of blood as well as a unique plot. However, the movie is not in English (don't know if I missed that somewhere),the movie is in French so in order to understand it subtitles are necessary. The movie is very good though and I would reccommend it."
3,Frontier(s) DVD,"At first I thought this may have been a defective disc, it wouldn't play in the first player I tried, but I did eventually find one that worked. I suppose I got what I paid for, so this is not a negative review."
4,well done French extreme horror film....,"after viewing the film...my thoughts were: wow, this was a really good horror film. The acting was very good, believable (especially the lead actress); the emotional tension / visual blood scenes / physical violence were mixed together well. I even liked the soundtrack, which fit perfectly to create a sense of unease.the plot is somewhat reminiscent of the recent (2003) re-make of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". (Group of young people get trapped in an isolated area by a family of psychotics). Also had a few plot elements of ""Hostel"".I thought the various fight / conflict scenes between the characters was well-done- the sound effects, level of violence, and misery was felt at the gut-level as a viewer.My only complaint: the first part of the film (first 20 minutes) wasn't really needed, and could have been cut out of the film. Rest of the film flows very well.pleasant surprise that horror fans will appreciate.."
2,I have seen much better...,"Fine, fine! It's a French film...blah blah. Being a hardcore gore/horror fan, this film did not suffice at all. It tried too hard to be polished and political, but it went a whole different direction. It had too many elements i have seen years ago in other films...pieces of SAW here and there (with the torture), pieces of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (with the deranged family), Hostel (with the seductive women luring men into their demise). GARBAGE! Watch it for the sake of watching it, but it's really stupid in my opinion."
1,Boring,"I was expecting quite a lot from this NC-17 unrated directors cut movie.I got a whole lot of nothing.It was boring, even the 'gory' parts were boring.The plot had holes you could fit the planet through.Makes me glad I rented it, although I feel ripped off on the 54 cents I paid."
2,stupid movie,well this is a stupid movie ok there are a lot of gore but1) THE ACTING IS VERY BAD THE DIALOGUE SO STUPID2) EVERYTIME THE BAD GUY HOLD A GUN BUT THEY NEVER KILL THEY SAID TO THE PELPE THEY WANT TO KILL COME ON COME ON AND OF COURSE THE GIRL OR ELSE KILL THE BAD GUYIT SEEMED THAT THE SCENARIO IS WELL DEFINITE AND STUPIDSO I GET BORED A LITTLE BIT AND I SAW THE SAME KIND OF MOVIE MANY TIMES BEFORESO OK IT IS A FRENCH MOVIE BUT INSIDE IS A FRENCH MOVIE TOO BUT IS MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ONE
2,"Been There, Done That.","Think of all your favorite scenes from horror movies, and imagine them put together with MTV style editing and a hip soundtrack. This is as unoriginal as horror films get! I swear i thought i was watching Sheitan for the first 30 minuets. Over rated gore and zero tension. Will keep most irregular horror viewers entertained."
2,No Clever Title,"Weird, crazy movie. Started out slow. You've got Nazi's, zombie kid, cannibals, one brave herroine, a bunch of gore and not a whole lot of it makes any sense."
2,Not even worth a rental,The only reason I didnt give the movie one star is because it was slightly better than another one I just got through reviewing. If I had it to do over again I wouldnt rent the movie again. If I had bought this movie I would have used the disc as a target.....or pawned it for a quarter or whatever pawn shops give for DVDs. Not at all a good movie.
3,"Hostel meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre, except worse","I love horror movies, and generally I can find the good in almost all the ones I have watched. While this movie isn't bad per say, it really doesn't have much of anything going for it outside of the gore factor. In a word, I found it boring. It borrows heavily from many other movies, movies that are better and did it better. Disappointing to say the least, I expected this movie to live up to the hype. It did not. 2 and a half stars."
2,You have all seen this before...,"It's your classic demented family in a rural farm complete with a torture chamber underneath. Throw in some ignorant tourists along with the mutated children of the family's least-favorite sibling and you have pretty much got the movie right there, and it's been done plenty of times before. They even throw in other cliche parts such as the night-vision camcorder with shaky movement as well as some gratuitous torture scenes and achilles tendon cutting.I literally didnt find a single original part in this movie. I would have given it a single star for blatant ""plagerism"" had it not been directed and produced fairly well. You will find this same story line in plenty of other movies, most of which do not need subtitles. You won't have to look far either, save yourself the time unless you are trying to brush up on your French."
3,Not the best French Horror,"But not bad either. I just didn't understand the whole Nazi angle to this movie. It did nothing to add to the movie, and perhaps made it seem more like a farce. It would have been better without it, in my opinion. It's Still worth a view if you like gory French Horror though."
3,Just worth watching,"I enjoyed this to the end. There was enough gore, brutality, crazy inbred villains, and gushing blood to keep me interested to the end. This is not the French answer to Hostel, it is different in many respects. It was blood soaked. If that's your thing, you will like it. If not, then don't watch it."
2,Mountain rehash,"I was never that much of a Mountain fan although as a guitar player, I had an appreciation for Leslie West. This CD didn't cut it for me."
2,Solid Brass Doesn't Take the Gold,"The book was more a collection of ""old sea dog"" anecdotes written down than it was a book. I was interested to learn about the early abalone harvesting in California, but had to wade through too many ""above-water, hell-raising"" stories that, frankly, bored me. It felt a bit like being trapped next to the wrong person at a high school reunion."
5,beyond words,I worked and dove with Bobby. I am pleased to say that I had the opertunity to watch him draw some of the pictures in this book as well as being blessed with having known this Great man
4,a struggle to overcome,"Bryden is learning to deal with the permanent loss of his sight when he meets Casey. Unknown to him, she is a guide dog trainer. Despite a strong attraction, when he discovers her occupation he drives her away. The rest of the novel is about his attempt to learn to handle a guide dog and win back her love. I liked this, because there was little pity, but rather he triumphs over adversity."
4,Liked From Your Grave better...,Good solid cd... I was really anticipating this one.. but it kind of let me down... I liked from your grave more... But it's still worth buying if you liked the last one... pick it up!
2,dolls and accessories of the 1950s,"I do not like this book. I have found more information on the dolls of the 1950s in other books. There is nothing spectacular about the ""accessories"" as in clothes or any other little things that they may have made for the dolls. Save your money and get it from the library."
1,purchased wrong item,Should have purchased compact flash to xd card adapter instead. Item has been returned. Will re-order when advised that refund is available to apply to correct item.
3,Not Appropriate for Undergraduate Classrooms,"The advantages of this collection are the number of plays it includes and its low price. Its grave disadvantage is the notes, which are insufficient for undergraduate classrooms, at least in the U.S. They're hit-or-miss. Sometimes they give you information you really do need, but they leave gaps. For instance, readers apparently should not need to be told that one of the meanings of ""motion"" in the seventeenth century is ""puppet show."" (See Volpone V.iv.77, on p. 332.) I used this edition to teach Volpone and Bartholomew Fair in a class of undergraduate English majors at a highly selective university in the fall of 2007. The unexplained vocabulary created a barrier for the students (and for me, frankly), and I ended up relying on the Norton edition edited by Richard Harp to fill in the gaps in our comprehension. I wish I had ordered that edition for the course instead; although it doesn't offer as many plays, it does also include three masques."
4,Meet Ben Jonson,"FYI, the plays included in this edition are Every Man in his Humour, Sejanus, Volpone, The Alchemist, and Bartholomew Fair. While Jonson's language is not as accessible as Shakespeare's, his plays are by no means a waste of time. No one had a sharper ear for the ways in which people in society delude themselves and others. Sejanus is rough going for anyone who isn't an ancient-Roman history buff, but the comedies offer wicked portraits of con artists, hustlers, wannabes, posers, and manglers of language. This edition doesn't offer a lot of help to readers unfamiliar with 17th-century English, but it's a good basic version of these plays, some of which aren't easy to find in cheap editions."
3,entertaining but too fluffy..,"I found The Richest Season well-written and entertaining, but it should have been cut..at least fifty to seventy five pages...all the descriptions of the minutae of Grace and Joanna's Island existence..at a certain point became boring..enough already of what they had for dinner, lunch, whether the old lady...fell alseep, looked older, younger..etc...around mid point...post the initial set-up, I wanted the story to move faster..but it didn't....and I found Grace an unlikeable old woman...and Joanna sort of an uninspiring lost soul....And the husband...he was for me by far the best of the lot...It was a little too much like a happy ever after Lifetime movie template....too fluffy...not enough edge...I feel it would draw many younger readers if the author .would fix those flaws, spice things up a bit."
3,More than just chick-lit,"The Richest Season is impressive for a first novel. Poignant and identifiable, there is something here for various generations and genders (well, sensitive men anyway), though baby boomers and their parents are the most likely audience - married women especially. (Not sure about Gens X & Y - does anyone under 30 read anymore?)Ms. McFadden covers a lot of ground and has much to say, all within familiar settings and scenes. Could use help on her storyline and characterization, weak in spots.A decent beach book (found it in a boardwalk book bin). Might make a snappy tv movie as well (especially given the ending...nuff said)."
5,A Must Read,"McFadden has brought her characters to life in this outstanding story. Through the story I felt that I was one, if not all, of the characters at some point in my life. Starting the book in New Jersey and finishing on the ferry boat into New York, I felt a part of this story. A must read for all!"
3,The Richest Season,I found the characters in this book to lack credibility. The heroine was weakkneed and her husband was very unbelievable. No one changes that much.
4,Life at Pawleys Island,"I especially enjoyed reading this book because I leave in Pawleys Island, SC, the setting for the book. The book took place before I moved here, so I'm not sure of its accuracy. It was fun reading about local places I have been, etc. The book itself was quite good, although the ending was rather predictable. I would recommend it however."
5,Keeps hands dry,This is a great chalk substitute. It helps keep my hands dry so that I can focus on lifting the weight when I'm deadlifting. I don't have to worry about the weight slipping out of my hands in the middle of a rep. I would recommend this if you're looking for something to keep your hands dry during a workout.
2,Good chalk substitute,I feel like the quality of the chalk substitute is great. It really helped me on weight lifting. Unfortunately the bag broke my first time using it so I spilled the whole bag in my pocket. That is the only reason I don't like it. Especially since I bought it trying to be covert in my gym.
2,Very loud!,"This guitar is very fun for my son, but it is very, very loud! He loves it, but I don't. I really think that it is dangerously loud and I wouldn't purchase it again."
1,"Cheap, loud, obnoxious and flimsy....","It is hard for me to imagine that the other reviews for this item are for the same product. I ordered this guitar for my niece and it's awful. The guitar and box looked beaten up when they arrived. The weight of the guitar feels cheap and the sound is horrific; zero musicality in the extraordinarily loud ""power chords"" it plays and the strings don't even faintly resemble a musical instrument. Just crummy fishing line strung to give the illusion of guitar strings without even the ability to attempt to tune them. I have two boys who love a lot of noise and even they covered their ears and asked me to take the batteries out. Needless to say, I won't be giving this to my niece."
3,Hot Rock Guitar,Shipped quickly but was broken when received. Emailed the vendor and he immediately put a new one out and shipped it directly to my grandson so that he would have it on time for his birthday. Very satisfied with speed and friendliness of correcting the situation
4,The Cheyenne and Black Hills stage and express routes,"An excellent source of information about the events and people in and around Deadwood, SD, during the gold rush years."
3,It's ok - need a new invention.,It's ok. I would prefer an organizer that would be fully enclosed and would cover up the bags. I find it hard to believe that they make a nifty cute one that hangs on the wall for plastic ones but not for paper sacks.
5,My 2 yr old loves this toy!!!,We bought this for Christmas for my 2 year old and she loves it!.. She recieved tons of toys and all day long we heard her singing into the mike! this is a great toy.
1,RETURNED,"This product was so cheap looking and it only took the cd's that were included. TERRIABLE, I RETURNED IT!"
2,Fun for a short time,My 3 year old daughter loved this toy even though it was the sound quality was not good. It only lasted us about 6 months before it stopped working completely. I do not recommend this product.
1,Bad Choice!,"My twin daughters love to sing karaoke, so they received this ""toy"" as a christmas gift. After the first day of use the music started to sound gurgly and the microphone quit working. My girls still enjoyed changing the discs and pretending until the disc cover jammed and became very difficult to open and close. I now use it as decoration with their other Disney collections."
1,Not a Boom Box,"The picture is misleading, this has little plastic disks resembling CDs but does not play CDs. The whole thing is a LOT smaller than it looks in the picture, and the sound is terrible."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"The picture is very misleading. Now I know why there wasn't a more thorough description. It only plays the little plastic cd's that come with it, and each cd only has 1-2 songs each. The sound quality isn't very good, either. My 3 year old plays with it (she is a princess fanatic), but she is disappointed that there aren't any more songs than those available."
3,Terrible Sound Quality,"The sound quality is truly awful. To begin with, the songs don't sound like the ones in the movies -- they sound like they were recorded by different singers with harsher, less pleasant voices. And THOSE voices are distorted by the poor quality of the audio player, so that they sound static-y, like a radio that isn't quite on the right station. After my daughters received this as a gift, we thought that the sour crackly music was due to batteries that had run down in the store, so we replaced them -- but the sound was the same."
2,Save your money!,"My 4-year-old daughter received this for her birthday. Although she likes it (she likes anything pink and princessy), she gets bored and frustrated with it. The door and ""discs"" are difficult to work. The sound quality is awful. You have to position your mouth right next to the microphone for it to pick up your voice. It is very limited because it only plays the 3 discs that come with it. After the first week or so, she hardly ever plays with it. There must be a better alternative. Save your money."
1,Piece of Garbage,I bought this toy for my daughter's 4th birthday. It was her favorite toy. Two days later the microphone plug broke. Then the toy quite playing the fake cds. Now when she turns it on it lights up but no sound comes out. I changed the batteries and it still doesn't work. Instead of buying this toy I would recommend a real cd player and Disney cds.
1,Not worth the money,"This toy did not work from day one. Every time you push the button to sing, the music goes off. The sound quality is so poor you can barely hear the lyrics over the staticky music. Save your money"
3,Don't be deceived by the way it looks !!!,"I bought this karaoke for my daughter's 5th birthday. It's a good radio but give it a day, the microphone plug will diappear. Bye bye karaoke !!!"
1,Not worth the money,My daughter recieved this toy for Christmas. It was cute until she opened it. The sound quality is terrible. There is static and the sound fades in and out. There is nothing good about this boom box. If your child likes to sing along this product would be the most disappointing. Don't buy this product. Maybe this product was just a defect from the beginning. I don't know but I know I would never recommend this to anyone.
3,AWFUL sound,"My 3 year old daughter loves to sing with this toy, but she gets VERY frustrated trying to make the mic work and change the disks. The sound quality SUCKS, and it seems to be cheaply made"
2,BIG disappointment!! Save your money,"My husband and I bought this for our 3 year old for Christmas 2004. She loved it when she first got it and couldn't wait to play with it. For less than a month, the microphone worked. She still tries to play with it, but is always disappointed when she can't get the microphone to work.The discs that come with this item, are cheap and there isn't much to them. I'd have given the educational value of this item ZERO stars, had it been an option."
1,dont buy this,i got 2 of these... but both of these was broken the mic did not work ...this was a awful xmas gift.
5,My daughter loves it!,We got this for our daughter a year ago (she had turned 2). She still sings in it and loves it. It is quite durable also. Our son (11 months old) has thrown it across the room and off the table quite a few times and hasn't broke once.Highly recommend for the little ones.
1,Don't waste your money,"My daughter received this as a birthday gift. She loves to sing on my Karaoke machine so we thought this would be perfect...wrong. The sound is so low that if you sing you can barely here the music. Also when you push the microphone button, most of the time the music just stops for no reason. It's also hard for little hands to change the discs....We used for a day or 2 and then gave up."
2,Find another toy,"Our two girls also love all things Disney princess, but this toy is a major disappointment. The quality is far below what we expect from the Disney brand -- the discs are very difficult to use; each disc has only a portion of one song; the sound on the microphone is awful and has lots of feedback; the door on the player is hard to open and close; the wires on the microphone are very fragile. Worst of all, the voices on the discs are not the original characters (they have noticeable Asian accents) -- it took my daughter who's all of 4 about 13 seconds to say ""That's not Ariel!"" Very disappointing. I can tell this toy will not survive a month and the girls are careful. Find another princess toy."
1,No worth the money,"My daugter wanted it for christmas,she used it like 5 times and it got damage. We had to go to the store and change it. The quality is very bad"
1,"Aweful, Waste of Money and Useless!",My daughter received this as a birthday present from a classmate. The music goes off as soon as the mic is turned on and the microphone blares with interference. What is the point of a Karaoke machine that turns off the music when you try to turn the mic on? This is definitely the worst toy to spend that much money on. I will see if the vendor will take the toy back and we'll get something else. It looks cute and appealing but offers nothing else. The sound quality is bad and the songs are very short.
2,boombox,i gave this to my daughter for her 3rd birthday on sunday and by thursday the thing had broke already. the microphone cuts in and out and the discs are very difficult to get them to stay in place. very loud toy. not a good purchase. very disappointed from disney princesses.
2,Too much money,"The microphone stopped working shortly after purchase. The product is not durable. Suppose to be karaoke, but not if microphone does not last. Daughter whose 4yrs old bored with it soon after microphone broke. For the money it is just not worth it. Recommend Little tykes sing along cassette recorder. Cheaper and more durable. For the price the cord to the microphone broke too easily. My daughter is not rough on toys at all."
1,Would not reccomend,"My husband and I bought this for his daughter for Christmas and was very disappointed. The microphone gives back a lot of interference, no matter how far away you are from the machine. There is not much to the songs and the words for them stop after a couple seconds. Which is not karaoke. The ""radio"" version of it is very repetitive. My stepdaughter got over it very fast. The only good thing about it is that it hasn't broke yet, but it has been on her shelf for a while!"
3,Short on stated memory,I realize that 32 mb means 32 million bytes which is actually less than 32 mb. SanDisk shortchanges that figure and you don't get nearly what you are paying for. I have 32 mb cards from other manufacturers and they all give substantially more memory than SanDisk. The cards work fine...
2,Other people have liked it.,"It has star power, but is not nearly as good as the Muppet version of the same story. There is a nice, liberal message -- the lower class can get along without the upper class a whole lot better than the upper class can get along without the lower class. But, I was bored, especially by Robin Williams, who is not nearly as cute as he thinks he is. Also, while I'm not a prude, I was...what...bothered?... I would have prefered full frontal nudity ... and we very nearly get that, too, in one scene. Kids won't notice, but there should be a warning for adults.Too bad the Muppet The Frog Prince is only on VHS."
5,Bad for Children,"This film contains language and sexual content. Robin Williams uses profanity and parental discretion is advised. It is a funny telling of the story for adults but not younger viewers... Parents should watch the movie first to decide if it is appropiate for their children, and trust me, it isn't!!!!"
1,Never received : ((((,"So sad that I never received this product. I remember watching it as a child. Bummer, can't bring myself to spend the money again"
3,misleading condition description,"This is a wonderful book and I am happy with it. Although, the description of the condition of the book was inaccurate and misleading. When I received it, there was a name printed on the front of the book in orange marker. The packing slip from the shipper basically said, oops--sorry, I didn't notice the marking on the cover when I described it as excellent condition (or whatever the ranking was). S/he must have had eyes closed or been in the dark to not see it, as it is obvious. If I had known of the marking, I would not have purchased that one. I would have purchased a less expensive one with a lower condition rating."
2,not the best,"I ordered this based on other reader reviews and disagree with what the others said. I thought it was redundant and boring. The erotica is presented as excerpts from a man's journal, and while there is sex, it's not what I would consider erotic. I'd recommend women look elsewhere for good erotica."
3,Save Your Money...there's nothing new here,"As one of many 5D ""Best Ofs,"" this (Japanese?) release doesn't have anything that the others are missing. In other words, there isn't a single track on this CD that doesn't appear on another digital collection. And though it's an excellent sampler of the 5D's hit catalog, it's price is completely out of line with similar import collections, which is why this is only a '3 star' release in my opinion. Unless you are a 5D completist, and can't live without this disc's obi strip and somewhat 'original' packaging, spend your hard-earned money elsewhere. 5D's ""Definitive Collection"" (on the domestic Arista label) is a two disc release that is both cheaper and more comprehensive than this release.-Stoned Soul"
5,Nice sailboat charm!,I was pleased with the sailboat charm the I ordered for my daughter for Christmas. Purchased a necklace and she loved it! Nice quality...in fact we are buying another one because my daughter wanted her sailing partner to have one too!
4,Agonizing and Frustrating,"The words are not as good as House of Mirth but still haunting. I was so frustrated with Newland, all talk and no action. He and May, contrary to his thoughts, were a perfect match."
3,Good View of Aristocratic Life,This was a good depiction of the ostensibly innocent arsitocractic society in the early 20th century. Wharton applies masterful irony but the ending lacks her usualy craft. A decent read about a man who doesn't know what he wants and his wife who just wants him to be happy.
3,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time. I would like the option to comment if I feel strongly about it one way or the other.
5,Absolutely my favorite book of all time.,"THE classic American novel. It's difficult to describe the true beauty and wonder of this masterpiece without sounding cliche, because in it Wharton has managed to achieve literary perfection: the writing, the story, the characters, the setting, the history, the sheer poetry . . . everything. I re-read this and The Great Gatsby year after year and only look forward to reading them again."
5,Beautifully Written,"Edith Wharton has a way with language that no other author ever has. Her tone and imagery is amazing. Her characters and subject matter lead you down a path that is memorable and entertainging. Newland Archer is a well mannered and sophisticated while still interesting. His marriage to well-breed May is expected, but it's those expectations that makes ""Age of Innocence"" so wonderful. The addition of the Countess is what drives this book. The senery is just wonderful and the description of every detail brings so much more to this fabulous novel. It's one of the best ever."
3,"not her best, but a worthy read","Edith Wharton is one of a handful of authors blessed with an extremely rich writing style. Her command of the English language is extraordinary. However she does not put this talent to its best advantage with this novel. More economical wording and, sorry to say, a better story would have been appreciated.Having said this, I found her attention to detail on New York and its (forgotten) upper class society to be very absorbing. The film version of The Age of Innocence didn't (and probably couldn't) reflect this detail and, in comparison to the novel, seemed two-dimensional.Finally, I would recommend The House of Mirth over this novel. While it doesn't discuss NY society in such detail, the overall story is much more moving and ... *personal* to the reader."
4,Really enjoyed this book!,I relucantly read this book as part of a book club. I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't want to put it down. It made me understand how people lived in late 1800s and their culture. It's well written and the Kindle had the added bonus of a dictionary to understand the 'old world' words!
4,Stick with it and get rewarded,"I chose this book out of a list of 'classics' that we were required to read for the second last year of school. I was attracted by the blurb (as I enjoy love stories) and decided to choose it. As you have probably read from previous reviews, the story is that of simple disallowed love, in the most stringent and narrow society, New York in the C19th. I found the novel hard to get through initially, wanting some action instead of drab descriptions of society.. ..but because I was forced to read the book, I continued, and I'm happy I did. Newland's characterisation is truely amazing, as well as the complexity of the Countess. The book raises some very important issues with society *today*, as it shows that change will always occur, no matter how we try to fight or stop it. The end is deeply moving, and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness, much like Newlands entire life. Overall a good read for almost anyone who enjoys emotional stirring. :)"
4,Read this novel and understand more about the human heart!,"In our modern age of ""do it if it feels good"" this novel is a worthwhile read. The love affair between Archer Newland and the sensual Ellen Olenska is all the more passionate and romantic for its restraint proscribed by the rigid social conventions of late nineteenth century upper-crust New York society.Newland eventually does ""the right thing"" in spite of his insight into the hypocrocies of the social class to which he belongs. He gives Ellen up, acts the gentleman, and carries her memory with him to warm his conventional passionless lifestyle.Beautifully written with one negative caveat. If any of these people had to worry about actual food and shelter, they would not have had time to obsess about unrequited love."
4,Somewhat Etchy but Still Very good,"The book itself wasn't the most interesting and modern thing to read, but it did focus a lot on the hypocrisy of society and the laws that still govern our world today. Edith Wharton does a fine job of depicting the lives and roles of the characters in rich detail.I suggest that if you want to read this novel, you better have a good (1)imagination and (2)patience. You're going to need both of them to get through this story line."
5,The Age of Innocence,"The Age of Innocence is the first book I have read by Edith Wharton. I love the way she portrays New York society in the 1870's and the way she truthfully reveals the corrupt nature of the gilded age. The repression of individualism and true thinking during this era is sickening, but the way Wharton sets up the plot, makes the reader see the sadness of a society so built on appearances. It was hard for me to believe that the characters in this book could sacrifice so much happiness in the name of morals soley based on appearances and ""duties."" These morals are as hollow as the society surrounding the gilded age. The sad irony in this book is enthralling and Wharton's style of writing is very precise, helping the reader to see through the masks of the characters and into their true emotions and thoughts."
1,Bad Kindle copy,"The story is superb, but this Kindle version of Edith Wharton's classic is a bad copy of the original. It must have been made from a low quality scan image because the number of typographical errors is amazing. For example, hanks instead of hands, berated instead of belated, anh instead of and. These sorts of errors indicate that the scan was of poor quality and the image content could not be read correctly by an OCR device. This may sound very pedantic, but often the error changes the meaning sufficiently (eg berated instead of belated) to completely throw one out of the moment. The reader is thus forced to keep a remove from total engagement with the story, waiting for these particularly un-apt errors to occur. My advice is to search out a better version than this one."
5,An Incredibly Beautiful Book.,I found the Age of Innocence to be an incredibly beautiful book. It has been a long time since I've read anything so masterfully written. It is a book that resonated with me on many levels and won't be forgotten very easily. The characters are wonderfully portrayed. It is a story of a romance that struggles against the norms and unwritten rules of the upper-class of NYC in the 1870's. More fundamentally though the book is also about the constraining/bounded environments/communities/affiliations that we all operate within. How some of us strive to breakout or go against the grain of these realms and take the associated risks. It is a novel of breaking free and seeking something more meaningful and deeper. It has my highest recommendation!
3,A classic,"Although a little dry, this is a true classic. The wording is wonderful. It is very nice seeing the proper English."
1,"great book, horrid kindle version",The formatting on this Kindle version of the book is horrid. I do not recommend it. I ended up borrowing the book from my library for much better formatting.
3,Not my Cup of Tea,"I read this for a book group I belong to. I found it very dry and exasperating as the characters are all 18th century society types who live out artificial lives created by antiquated norms for behavior. At our book club meeting, I gained a better understanding that the author found herself in the same predicament, wealthy society member that broke all of the norms by becoming a writer of novels. That helps but the reading itself was agonizingly slow."
3,Olsen,"A Pulitzer Prize winning author in her time this novel comments upon New York society and morals at the end of the 19th century. Although low on plot but high on atmosphere and character description, it is not a difficult read but only recommended for those with some interest in social history. I really enjoyed it."
4,Age of Innocence,"This was a book club selection & when I first started reading it, I didn't like it & found it boring.After I got into it, I was intrigued by the characters, the plot and the rich descriptions of New Yorksociety in that time period. An excellent read!"
1,Boring as all heck...,"I read this book because it was assigned to me by our book club. I have gotten 20% of the way in and nothing important has happened. There are WAY too many characters (too many rich families) to keep straight, and they are all boring, self righteous, and wordy. Don't bother reading..."
2,"INTERESTING, BUT REALLY HARD TO STAY FOCUSED.","I had to read this book for an Advanced Placement English class. I would spend hours at a time reading, but make little progress. Everything was too descriptive and it took too long to get into the novel. The overall story line was a good one, but I didn't like the way it was developed. I also found it very difficult to find critiques on this book, as I needed them for the paper I did on ""The Age Of Innocence"" and Edith Wharton. I would not suggest this book to anyone, although I did learn a lot by doing my paper on it."
5,you learn something special in reading this novel.,"Few books are able to capture the depressing truth in societies marked by ""women in white and fellows with tennis balls"". (that quote's from the musical Ragtime). It is a soul-wrenching, and enlightening book; and one will look upon society in a different way after reading it."
2,The age of Innocense,The product arrived a month after order for a book club. It was returned. The general service by Amazon is TERRIBlE.
2,Age of Pretense,"I really liked Wharton's ""House of Mirth"" but could not stand this book. I think it was my extreme dislike of all the characters--all shallow, manipulative people who rigidly followed the aristocratic social mores of the time. The language was stilted and the social scenes boring. Read ""House of Mirth"" and forget this one."
3,Age of Innocence book,"This book replaced the one I had because it was wearing thin. I loved the movie, and the book, not so much as it was quite difficult to keep interested in it as I was with the movie. Edith Wharton's prose isn't quite my cup of tea but it did win the Pulitzer Prize that year. I'm just glad I didn't live in that era, where one can be ostracized for letting someone else make a social mistake, like going to see somebody considered ""common"". Specially after some other high society couple went out of their way to throw a party in her honor. Then the high society couple gets fed up too. After all they did for the good of someone else. Really?"
5,A riveting novel.,"Edith Wharton was the first woman author to win a Pulitzer Prize.She won for this novel in 1920.If you do not like period pieces, detailed language, and vivid descriptions I urge you to stay away from this masterpiece.It is a thoroughyly engrossing read.Edith Wharton herself endured an unhappy marriage, and it has been speculated upon that Newland Archer is actually herself.This book has held up completely well.Not recommended for the nonromantics, or the lovers of action, this novel is sheer genius.You feel the inertia of the times, the ridiculous wanting to fit into the New York society filled with hypocrisy.Truly a gem I could not put down.In my opinion, the film does depict the book rather well."
2,No Sympathy,"I'm giving this two stars only because I somehow managed to get through the entire thing. I cannot deny that it is a beautifully written book that deals very well with the constraints of the social norms of the late 19th century.That said, I found both of the main characters remarkably difficult to like. The only character for whom I felt any sympathy was the hapless May Archer who managed to put up a good front in spite of her husband pining away after ""love lost."" At least the ending was satisfying as it showed some personal growth on the part of Newland Archer."
2,Low budget video,"If you are looking for in-depth tips into sniper tactics or a biography of the great Carlos Hathcock, don't expect to find it in this video. It was a poorly conceived production that did not do him justice. Sgt. Hathcock told a few stories and gave a couple of general suggestions on sniping from behind a desk throughout the entire tape. The sound quality was terrible and the videography could have been done better by my 8 year old daughter.Don't waste your money on this."
2,"Decent Video, must have for sniper fans","A video done on a legend. There is some personal accounts on this video that would interest anyone interested in sniping, I would recommend you purchase the video for that reason and that reason alone. The quality in the making of this tape is that of setting up the home video camera and letting it roll while a legend talks."
4,Helpful,I purchased this book because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region of New York State. The book was helpful as far as gaining some insights into the life styles of these people. I really was not reading this book for its entertainment value.
3,Great Book! Not enough Hitchcock,"I have to agree with the others who reviewed this book, that there isn't enough Hitchcock in the story. In a way it is misleading in the sense that you expect Hitchcock to do a lot of the detective work instead of the ex-cop but it is still a great book and I don't regret buying it!!"
3,The Case of the Mysterious Author,"Daniel Auiler, who wrote a definitive book on the making of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", now uses that film (and film-maker) for a PI novel that is enjoyable enough and fun to read. The big mystery is why he uses the name J. Madison Davis as the author of the paperback edition of the book. The hardcover, due any minute, seems to use his real name, and the book is listed under that name in bookstore records. But the use of the Davis moniker tends to confuse would-be readers search and gets the book filed under ""D"" on many shelves. There must BE a reason, but... what is it?"
2,Not much meat...,"The book is not very deep. About a half of the book talks about PCs. If you take out all the graphs from the other half, you'll be left with about 25 pages of writing. The advice is good, there's just not a whole lot of it, perhaps we're expected to buy the sequel. This book sounds like it has a British accent."
2,CEE,"I've had success with Controlled Labs products, but this one fell short. My body responded more to straight Creatine Monohydrate than this. There weren't side effects as stated by the company, but I'm not so sure it had results either."
1,"Great song, very good video, awful remixes....","I think Hung Up, Sorry and Get Together are some of the best Madonna's works; but the remixes are awful, with very few exceptions."
2,What a shame!,"What a shame, but all I have to say is that such a nice track as ""Get together"" did deserve better remixes. Overall, one must admit that hardly any remix from ""Confessions on a dancefloor"" has lived up to the album versions.I'm SORRY, and very HUNG UP on this feeling, just hoping that Madonna's crew GET TOGETHER and think it over!Justice must be made to the PSB Sorry remix and to the extended version of Hung Up."
2,Dance Mixes Are Missing,"An upbeat danceable remix of Get Together is NOT included on the Remix Single. The Jacques Lu Cont Mix never really picks up. The guitar and bass line drone. The Danny Howells & Dick Trevor Kinky Funk Mix is long and repetitive and never really picks up either. The last two experimental tracks are very loosely connected to the track and probably would not be played in clubs. Including ""alternative"" mixes is welcome, however a dance club anthem from a DJ such as Peter Rauhofer would have been welcome too.A danceable I love New York [White Duke Remix] is included. It refreshingly shaves off most of the lyrics from the original and has harder guitar riffs and beats. Some lyrics are mixed and matched in the middle of the track to say, ""...Paris & London you can F-off."""
5,Get Together,"As alwways, MADONNA, for decades now, has beenon the top!!!! WILL SHE EVER HAVE A CD THAT FLOPS? I do not think so, this is an amazing and talented artist that will keep on going, and going, and going, isn't that like the energizer bunny????One of the world's greatest female singers for decades and more decades to come.LOVE YOU MADONNA!!!~~~~"
2,Dreadful mixes,"I have to agree with some of the negative reviews of ""Get Together"". They're awful.I expected more from Madonna. I agree that none of the Confessions remixes have improved upon the original versions, and these mixes simply should not have been prepared.The only one worth listening to is the ""I Love New York"" mix, but it's only average.Hopefully ""Jump"" will be released and there will be some decent mixes commissioned for that song."
1,Who cares about this ugly g**n** w*pp*r!,"Triple H(mocking Fed Up): OH MY GAWD, Madonna is like so cool! Shawn Michael(as Hellraiser): SHE IS LIKE BETTER THAN RUSH AND PINK FLOYD! Triple H: Shawn, get a hold of yourself, Madonna is a stupid, ugly, sl*tty hypocritical pig! Shawn Michaels: This disgrace to Italian Americans is stuck in 1979 when disco has been DEAD for 27 years. Triple H: Want real women in rock music, get some Girlschool who were discovered by my good friend Lemmy! Shawn Michaels: Get some Heart instead! If you are not down with D-X, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA........S*CK IT!"
2,"Nice Song, But Bad Remixes","Since becoming British, Madonna has not been the same artist and while I consider Confessions an album that clearly shows she is running out of ideas, ""Get Together"" has always been one of my favorite Madonna tracks. However, the remixes are awful. What happened? Madonna's remixes used to take her songs to a new level, but her recent remixes are flat. I really had high hopes for this song because the song is so interesting. Oh well, you can't be number one forever."
2,Real dissapointing...such Terrible Remixes!,"Get Together is a real good song, but when I heard those remixes on it, and I bought this US Import - I thought ohh my god, absolutely terrible, some of the worst remixes especially the James Holden Remix is the worst, but the others on this Single couldn't convince me at all either! - Why didn't Madonna worked with the same people again as on the real good Remixes on the former Sorry Single, or gave it to some real good DJ's like Peter Rauhofer for example - A real mystery, only Madonna knows - Though the quite good I LOVE NEW YORK Dub makes up for a bit there, but its sadly not enough. What a shame for such a good song from Confessions, only hope there be either a part 2 to it or new Remixes to download, as I heard already parts of these on the Net, which are way better, than these so boring bad remixes...Lets hope, but for this single as many mention, I see only 2 Stars, where I normaly give 5...What a shame!"
1,terrible mixes,"US Domestic singles always sells for $5.99 at Tower Records for Maxi domestic singles or lesser for fewer track singles. I bought this at Tower Records for $7.99 which is equivalent to an import single. Yes... Warner Bros. raised the price of Madonna's Get Together maxi single. Plus, the mixes are freakin' boring and dreadful. The only decent one is the I Love New York which is a dub version and not any better than the album version. Dreadful Dreadful Dreadful waste of money. I will never buy a domestic single after the $2.00 hike in prices. And i will never buy from PerfectBeat.com cuz they over inflated the prices and they're a racist company much like Abercrombie & Fitch."
3,I'd Rather Stay Alone...,"Get Together, a dramatic choice as third single, made a hugh beat up tone and one of the best songs on the album but not as good as Hung Up or Jump. Get Together goes from soft dance trip to a very vocal track. Madonna is good at the song but hey, the song isn't a very single prototype. The remixes are ok but still average compared to previous singles. Hung Up remixes are classic and Sorry's were more dance tracks but this goes on formula and Madonna's songs are very good to explore with. The single is not bad but could have been better."
2,Madonna and these Remixers should have never gotten together!,"I must admit that white label remixers have done better work on such a great album's tracks than these ""top notch"" remixers. Consider those white label remixes by Cleopatra and Hitmixers and these official dubs fall flat. I have even heard a high energy mashup of ""Get Together"" and Stardust's ""Music Sounds Better With You"" making the release of this maxi-single unecessary. It's true: Danni Howell's remix of ""Get Together"" is the only worthwhile version on such a good single. The rest are plain uninteresting. It's a cd single obsolete for club disc jockeys. Nevertheless, I'm glad that the remixes for ""Sorry"" and ""Hung Up"" did not have the same fate. Consider this single experimental and forgive the record company, but it's not quite needed if you are not a Madonna completist."
2,"Get together, great song but the remixes sucks!!!!!","OK, for me, the best song of this album is ""Get together"", since I heard if from the first time, I realize that it's a very good song and it would be great if Madonna realize it as a new single, have the right lyrics and the music is awesome.But hearing the remixes that are included in this maxi, I get very dissapointed. All of them are boring and nothing new or cool, that makes me feel go to dance is in this production. I think that the best version, ironically, is the first one, the ""Album version"", and the best mix is the last one: ""I love New York"" (Thin White Duke Mix)"
3,Correction to review below,"Just a correction, if Get Together goes to #1 on the Club Play chart it will be her 36th not 39th.Anyway, the single is good, not great. The first 2 mixes are the best"
2,Boring.,"I gave in to the hype and I purchased HUNG UP. Which to my surprise had strong remixes that I prefer over the single. I steered clear of the the atrocious SORRY. And considering I thought that GET TOGETHER is one of the better tracks from the Confessions album (and that is not saying much) I anticipated this release. But alas the remixes were too 'experimental' and not more danceable. I can appreciate innovative and different styles of remixing, but to strip down something that tends to be already blase only makes the song more boring. Surprisingly my favorite track from this CD is the Thin White Duke take on I LOVE NEW YORK. Because of course most of the idiotic lyrics were left out. :)Madonna and/or Stuart Price need to stop copying Goldfrapp already. These style of remixes only work for someone like Goldfrapp who have brilliant singles and amazing remixes."
3,GET TOGETHER OVER ME,"another great track from the confessions album, however, the remixes are a different story. i only liked the album version (of course) and the Danny Howells & Dick Trevor KinkyFunk Mix good. the rest are not that good.however, madonna is always the one to beat. long live the queen..."
2,Weak tracks,I was disappointed with what I heard when I first listened to the two remix versions. This is not what I usually used to get from listening to remixes on Madonna album version tracks in the past.
1,Get together?! your remixes,I thought this was the best track on the album...and the remixes are truly horrible and do no good to the song...sounds like it was put together in an hour by a school janiter
3,Another wasted sequal to a Madonna single!!!,"You could already get all of these tracks on the Part 1 of ""Get Together""!!! What a waste! Not even an edit on this!!! i don't really understand why the record company puts out so many parts to one single it is such a waste of money for us!! but i guess they do it to pawn the Madonna collectors into wasting there money. This is a waste don't buy it... if you must, buy it but i warn you that part 1 is much much much better so bye have fun with this Great album version! but terrible two mixes byebyebyebyebyebye."
2,boring,"I'm big madonna fan,but I don't know why she released this boring song!!mixes are awful!!she didn't have a good mix since What it feels for a girl!!!I'm sorry madonna,you should find somebody wisely to pick hits and mixes!!"
2,"NICE SONG, AWFUL REMIXES...","WELL, THINK OF THIS: SOMEONE SAID MADONNA: ""HEY, CHOOSE THE WORST REMIXES YOU'VE EVER HEARD..."" AND SO, THIS SINGLE WAS RELEASED...IT'S AMAZING HOW MADONNA COULD MAKE THIS...REALLY THESE VERSIONS ARE TERRIBLE, BAD, UGLY...EXCEPT THE ""DANNY HOWELLS & DICK TREVOR REMIX. IT'S THE ONLY ONE DECENT TRACK ON THIS CD, IT'S DANCEABLE, AND CLUB FRIENDLY. BUT DON'T GO TO THE ""JAMES HOLDEN MIX"" IT'S REALLY BAD. ALL THE SONG LONG AN ANNOYING BUMPING SOUND PLAYS TIME AFTER TIME. WHERE ARE THE VICTOR CALDERONE, SASHA'S, JUNIOR VAZQUEZ', THUNDERPUSS'COOL REMIXES? WELL MAYBE MADONNA IS SO BELIEVED TO BE THE BEST , THAT SHE'S PUTTING LESS EFFORT ALBUM AFTER ALBUM..."
1,Not a one size fits all,"The mount did not fit my handle bar. If you have an oversized handle bar; which seems to be the most common these days, don't bother purchasing this product."
2,"Great idea for a book, but to much blah blah blah...","I was enthusiastic about reading this book. What a great idea, recognizing the basic shapes of nature; triangles, spirals, horizontal and diagonal lines, and radial lines. The problem is that Gary seems to go on and on about his philosophy of photography. I concise how-to book on creative and abstract nature photography this ain't. I ended up skimming the book and returning it to the bookstore."
3,MST needs to be re-edited,"Some of the stuff is OK.There's too much silly stuff which is really annoying and makes me wonder why I'm watching.SOME MS episodes are obviously MUCH better than others.The good ones are in the minority, but they are worth the watching.The original ""Best Of"" set is good and earlier collections seem more consistent and a little less on the silly side, somewhat.There is likely good reasons why these latest inclusions are finally appearing for sell.I watched many of these on cable back in the day, and they went down easier in a party (of geeks) with some chemical agents.(Not an endorsement for chemical agents. Watch Breaking Bad and Reefer Madness for a clue to the druggie culture's dark side. Dark as in the old days, when a person could be attacked at night; robbed, etc. because there were no street lights. Not fun.)"
5,I watch these over and over!,"I agree with the reviewer about the shorts "" A Day at the Fair"" and "" X Marks the Spot"" as two of the best reasons ( to me ) to own this! I laughed until I cried and I live the was the riffing is so sublime you may miss something until the second time you watch it! There is nothing else like this series! I treasure it!!"
4,one of the best!,if your interested in mystery novels you should read this or any other Agatha Christie novels especially before 1960s. highly recommended!
3,"Intriguing puzzle, but lumbering prose","Nemesis sadly shows Christie's age--or an editor who was overawed or underemployed. The writing lacks the sparkle of earlier works. Even aside from the puzzles, Christie's writing is usually a delight, but Nemesis drags on painfully in spots; I even found myself scanning pages, which I've never done with other Christie books."
5,A great Miss Marple mystery,"This was billed as Miss Marple's last case, but I think there were actually some written later. Still, it is probably one of her last. In this story, Miss Marple discovers that a millionaire that she had encountered in the Caribbean has died and has left a request for her to take on a task. She eventualy figures out what the task is and performs it for him. Once again, Miss Marple comes through. I like Miss Marple better than Christie's other characters, so this was a natural for me. Still, it's a pretty good story for anyone. Just remember that Miss Marple mysteries are not action stories; they are solved by reasoning and investigating. So, if you like lots of action, you may not care for this type of story."
4,Intriguing mystery of the Miss Marple line,"Agatha Christie is a master of turning traditional mysteries up-side-down. The premise in the Miss Marple story is particularly unusual in that the detective is set upon the trail by a man who is now dead. Miss Marple has virtually no clues to begin, not even whose murder she is trying to solve. All the clues are presented for the reader to solve the mystery; no ""you had to have been there"" sequences to interfere with solving the murder. Christie's style is the simple straight-forward narrative of an elderly protagonist in England. The perfect novel to chose when bundling up beside the fire on a winter's evening."
3,Last written but not last published,"To clarify D. McKinzie's statement written above: NEMESIS was the last Miss Marple novel written by Christie. Another, SLEEPING MURDER, published after the author's death, was actually written in the 1940s. I give it only three stars, not because it was all that bad, but because most of the other Marple books were so much better. Its shortcomings must be forgiven when we remember that Christie was well into her eighties when it was written."
3,It is what it is.,"I am a huge Steve Vai but I will keep it real. It is left over tracks that did not make it on Flex-able with bonus cuts. So if you don't have any Vai or are just starting to check him out, you may find other items in his catalog more satisfying. But if your a fan well grab it and enjoy it."
4,Great fun,"Fanfan la Tulipe, in its 1952 Gerard Philippe incarnation, is a highly enjoyable romp that alternates between the bawdy and the witty as it follows the adventures of its marriage-averse hero as he joins the army after Gina Lollabrigida's fake gypsy predicts he will marry the King's daughter as the seven-years Lace War rages pointlessly in the background. It's got energy to spare as it races from one action scene or comic setpiece to another, and while there's nothing particularly original on display, it's done with such enthusiasm it's hard to dislike. It's also the only film I've seen where Lollabrigida plays a genuinely likeable character, and quite charming she is too.The UK PAL DVD comes with the original black and white version and a surprisingly good colorized version."
4,Reminds of the Errol Flynn films,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Fanfan la Tulipe, is a film about Fanfan a man who joins the French army in a spur-of-the-moment decision to avoid being in a shotgun wedding after a liason with a local man's daughter. He then rescues a woman from some bandits and falls in love with her.This film is consideres a swashbuckling film which is how it reminds me of three Errol Flynn films. ""Captain Blood"" ""The Sea Hawk"" and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" I liked this film too and liked the swordfights.The film has some nice supplements too. There is a segment from the colorized version of the film, produced by the French government, a biographical sengment about lead actor Gérard Philipe, the theatrical trailer and an optional English language dub.This is a very nice film and I highly recommend it."
4,Welcome to an animal world beyond Pogo!,"This is the very beginning of a very amusing saga involving funny animals - a welcome combination of ""Calvin and Hobbes"", ""The Bloom County"", and ""Pogo"", which are all now gone forever from the funny pages. In this zany comic strip, the follies of human nature are slyly observed through the bright eyes of a know-it-all turtle and an arrogant raccoon with his unquenchable thirst for chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate! Though this book may not be recommanded for anyone who don't have time for so many words, there are still fans out there who would love to read such witty dialouge from this silly pair of surburban slinkers!"
5,"If you want more business this is a ""must"" read.","Everyone is busy. Everyone is on information overload. How would you like to grab the attention of a future prospect in less than 10 seconds. In this book ""less is more"" is effectively presented. Ivan Misner teaches everyone looking for more business how to turbocharge their referrals with the use of 'memory hooks"". A favorable first and lasting impression is the focus of a good memory hook. This book is entertaining as well as informative. Have fun on your way to greater sales."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this item @ my local Home Depot store to cut some 1 1/2 in. pvc. All I can say is that it is a pain to use. It requires a lot of force to cut and even then it will shatter the pipe if the pipe is old and brittle or if you manage to not shatter the pipe it will not cut all the way thru it will leave a small amount that you have to twist off, and it won't even cut straight. Not worth the aggravation, I ended up returning it. It may work better with 1/2 pvc but anything bigger, forget about it."
4,KABBALAH FOR TEENS,"In an easy-to-read style, the author outlines the ten principles of Kabbalah, showing teens how they can apply these to their daily life. Each chapter explains a concept, or ""Sefirah,"" then shows teens how they can use that concept in order to make good choices for themselves.Belmont has written a sort of a self-help book which teens and adults who are interested in the Kabbalah on this level, as a ""deeply spiritual system,"" will enjoy reading. With the heightened interest in the subject, thanks to such personalities as Madonna and Deepak Chopra, this will be a useful purchase as a beginning introduction to Kabbalah. The author is a life-long student of Kabbalah, and stresses that the principles aren't easy, but that studying it ""can provide a set of tools for making one's life better in every way."" Recommended for ages 12 and up. Reviewed by Andrea Davidson"
3,Elitist party music,"3 1/2With three distinct sections that contrast nicely with each other, experimental lovers of clean-sounding saxophone will find much to appreciate with the composer's classical take on the instrument. As is common with most Glass, the work mainly does not go past exercise, but unlike other compositional indulgences, these exercises do not feel vacantly strained in the slightest."
3,cute --- you do get what you pay for,"Pink, fluffy, princess-y - and it talks!At $10, it's about the price of non-talking plastic play telephones. If your child likes pink and princesses, this phone is a good choice.The phone's packaging does permit play by visitors to toy stores, so (of course) you will want to make sure you find one that has not been too 'played with' and still has a nice, audible sound. We have found this phone to be equally sturdy to other play telephones. None of our parts have come off, been lost, or worn out. The 'buttons' are not an integral part of the phone, however, so if a child constantly pulled at them I'm sure they could be removed. Our three-year old daughter does not play with any of her toys in that manner so this has not been a problem for us.Cute and nice value for the money."
3,Plug adapter review,"This product is worth the money, as long as you do not care how it looks.The only thing to keep in mind is that this converts the plug, not the voltage; you still need a voltage adapter if your appliance does not already support the required wall voltage."
4,Another great book,"I enjoyed the law of three very much. I think the only thing I seemed to miss in this last book was the descriptive ethreal episodes. They were there in ""The Law of Three"" but not as intense as in the last 3 books. More than likely I just got into a habit of reading the ethreal episodes and this one took on a different twist. I still feel like this was a great, well written book from such a wonderful author. Again, I tip my hat to you Mr. Sellars, I have yet to find a book that you have written that I didn't like. I love your work keep on writing no matter what anyone else thinks. Do what you love ! Those are the things that keep us happy and sane in this mundane world in which we all live. I can't wait for the next book. Looking forward to what will happen next. Ummmm, let me ponder could it be that Eldon still finds a way to get to Rowan maybe through Ms. Albright? Keep on smiling, Keep on writing, and I will keep on reading."
4,Very Cool LP,I have this On Vinyl Record and Its a great LP not sure why it has such a Low Rating I really like this band the this LP
2,Nothing like the first Collectors cd,This music is not at all like the first Collectors cd and seems a lot like regular music without the deep lyrics and long instramental parts that made the first Collectors cd special.If you expect something magical and different like the first cd you will be somewhat disappointed with this its mostly singing and not much playing between the words.
2,"Excellent cassettes, but no book","For what I received (only 2 cassettes), it was great. But the editorial review does specifically state that a book with exercises would be included for the price. Inside my box from Amazon was only 2 cassettes....nothing else. For $41, I'm very disappointed. I planned to use the cassettes and the book with exercises together to teach English. Now I only have the cassettes, and I guess I'll have to create my own exercises. If you do order this, be ready to accept that you're buying only two (2) cassettes, despite what this webpage says.Later edit:It has been well over a month since I wrote my first review above. I'm glad to see that, since that time, the people at Amazon have lowered their price for this item from $41 to $26. Over twenty bucks per cassette was far too expensive, although Mark Hancock unquestionably deserves to be loudly applauded for the materials and concepts found therein. Based upon the new price, I give this item 4 and a half stars."
1,Pure Plastic w/o vent air flow control!,Is not an adjustable vent opener. It has one piece of plastic that covers it. So the vent is either open or closed w/ the cover on it. There is NO LEVER that controls the flow of air like a metal vent does. Returned it
4,They sent me the wrong book,"I ordered this book, but instead, I received a book called ""The German-Bolshevik Conspiracy"" in which Germany is blamed for starting Communism.I am not sure if someone was playing a sick joke, buy I find it hard to believe that they could mistakenly send me that book instead. I'm not sure if someone at the bookstore (Run For Cover! Books based in Brooklyn) switched the books, or if the mail was tampered with, but I never received it, and now Amazon says there are no copies of the book available from any suppliers..... :(The incorrect book they sent me is a propaganda book that shows no link between Judaism and Bolshevism"
4,Great Book!,This book was a great review and a good reference to have on hand. I would definitely recommend this book.
5,Read it! But only with a box of tissues for the books end!!,"As a story teller, Anne McCaffrey is the story tellers, story teller! You won't be able to put it down, nor will you want to. This dramatic book brings the Pern saga to the point of ending Thread Fall forever, but at great cost. Like most of Anne's books, you can see, feel, even taste, Pern and those magnificent Dragons. The yearning for more will continue, and I can only hope that this wonderful series will continue. If you have not read it,don't miss this book. You will never forgive yourself."
3,In intresting ending to the series,"I thought that it was kind of to bad that the sort of medievil tone was brought to an end. I always enjoyed the mystery that you always had- where did the the dragons come from? why did men come to pern? I think that it might have been an better idea for them to have never found avias, because it will ruin their culture, destroying the weyr, and sending the political system in to turmoil. I also thought that the carectors where sort of shallow, and not as well described as the other books, but I have to say, it was exciting, and the anhillation of thread sort of brought a relief to me (Okay, I'm obsesed.) It was over all an OK book. Not as good as the other ones."
5,good story,I liked this book when I read it 20 years ago. I still like it.good good good good good good
5,I Love Pern in all it's Glory,I have read all of Anne McCaffrey's books.Pern series is my favorite.There is nothing more thrilling than to read about riding dragons.I have re read all of the Pern series over 8 times each.Not 1 of her books has any slow areas.They grab you and hold your attention right from the beginning.When that last page is done you beg for more.
1,Text to Speech Not Enabled.,Had I known that text to speech was not enabled I would have saved myself eight bucks. As it is I spent the money for a product I won't be using.
5,love it,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
4,Another good read,I am a huge fan of the dragonriders of pern series. Wish all my favorite books never had to end!
4,this is the greatest dragon series of all times.,this the second time that i have read this series and this book is the end of the journey that started with dragonsdawn
4,Best pad out there!,I've gone through every brand of housebreaking pad with my 4 month old toy poodle puppy. These are the best! Perfect size for her size small puppy apartment crate. They absorb well and there is never any tracking or leaking. I only wish they came in a bigger pack. 28 pack just isn't enough. Thanks to amazon prime I have free 2 day shipping and can order them as often as I need.
3,"Not the ""real thing"" at all...","I bought a couple of these hats (a white and a black one). These are cheezy Chinese-madehats suitable only for costume parties or gag gifts..No gold metallic trim...just yellow thread.No brass buttons, either. And no crown liner- your hair will soon stain the fabric. Disappointed.Not suitable for a serious yachtsmen but perhaps perfect for the 20' Bayliner weekend skipper."
2,Watch battery was low.,Watch face dicolored. The watch band has been cut and readjusted. Battery was low and back light is very dim.
4,Good Information,"The Suunto Observer is quality as are all Suunto products,the only drawback is the resin band,as I read in the reviews,they need to replace this band with a soft rubber band like you find on Reactor Watches! Ihad my Observer only two weeks when the band clasp cracked and I don't think that is covered under the warranty!"
3,Suunto Observer,"Cool features. Hard to see in sunlight, band is not as comfortable as I had hoped. Compass is hard to set."
2,"Good features, poor execution","The watch looks great and has all the features I wanted in a sleek size (for the features it has at least). All the features seemed to work as advertised, though the temperature only works well when you aren't wearing the watch.I had two reasons for the low review. First, the user interface seems overly complicated. I rarely could figure out how to do anything other then switch screens on this watch without the manual. I've owned other feature full watches before and this was the hardest to use. Second, the band sucks. The first two years I had it the band broke twice and it uses a custom band so you have to pay $$ to get another one, just to have it break again. After the 2nd time it broke I threw it to the back of the drawer in digest. I will not put more money into it."
3,"Great Facts, Poor form","This book is great in presenting many fascinating and sometimes humorous facts about the old mining days of California and Nevada. The lengths both writers went to to confirm their stories is to be admired. However, is quite frustrating to read for the book flows awkwardly. Misplaced commas, typos, and a constant jumping from past to present in the same paragraph can slow down the reader's understanding. Some chapters have titles about certain characters, but do not offer a complete story or even center on that person. I would go on, but the rarity of the content makes the book worthwhile on its own."
2,Poorly written,"A very brief choppy account of mining towns from the late 1800s to early 1900s. Felt very incomplete, the accounts were so short and rough. The second half of the book was better than the first. Not really worth reading though."
1,AIDS experts not impressed with Death Rush,"Research on this book reveals that it has been part of an anti-poppers campaign that's been waged by these authors for many years. The AIDS research community long ago generally dismissed the book, and its theories.The scientist who gave AIDS its name, Bruce Voeller, Ph.D., was quoted in a Mariposa Education & Research Foundation White Paper in 1986, saying that ""I can also tell you that the intense campaigns against use of volatile nitrites conducted by Hank Wilson in San Francisco... and John Lauritsen in New York, are slim in scientific merit.""Written by anti-popper zealots who were both unable and unwilling to be objective about the subject, the authors' theories were subsequently invalidated by later research. The book (more properly called a phamplet) remains out of print it seems, which is where it belongs."
1,Order This Title In Case You Run Out Of Toilet Paper...,"...cause that's all it's good for.Some people will do anything to avoid admitting they were incorrect about something, yet one would hope that after 20 years of spreading fear and misinformation linking poppers to HIV/AIDS, these authors would finally have the courage to fess up and/or shut up. Apparently not.Anyone with any common sense or intelligence can tell from the statistics: If poppers caused AIDS or HIV, then the infection rates would still be skyrocketing everywhere poppers were sold and used. It's exactly like when people were afraid you could get AIDS/HIV from kissing; if that were true, we'd all have it. The numbers just aren't there.On second thought, I take back what I said about using this publication for toilet paper. I don't wanna insult any toilet paper manufacturers...this trash isn't worthy of being compared to toilet paper."
1,This is junk science at its worse.,"Lauritsen and Wilson sadly have it all wrong in a booklet that is nearly twenty years old. Their theories about ""poppers"" and AIDS are as outside the mainstream of responsible research as are their theories that AIDS is NOT caused by the HIV virus.Such junk science, as exemplified in this small booklet, should indeed be ""out of print"", since it terribly misleads the reader and does a disservice to all those impacted and affected by HIV and AIDS."
5,Don't listen to reviews below,"Don't listen to the reviews below (which appear to have been written by the same person, probably a plant from one of the major popper companies). This book contains dozens of references to the literature available at the time. In any case, the price is trivial, and you should make up your own mind."
1,Suction does not work,"This basket keeps sliding down my stainless steel sink. It doesn't stay up even 10 minutes before sliding. The steel basket is large enough to hold two sponges, a bottle of dish soap and a bottle of hand soap though."
1,It did not work for me,"I am not sure how it worked for the many customers before me. It didn't work for me. The item looks cheap, especially the suction cups. I put two bottles of shampoo and one bottle of conditioner in it. Sucked it up on the smooth bathroom wall. It fell down within a 30 minutes. I tried it again. It did the same thing."
3,Suction cups are worthless,Basket is nice. Suction cups are completely worthless. I even tried all the helpful hints in other reviews. I finally cut the suction cups off and stuck it to the wall with Command hooks.
3,Maximum Style,"Several million dollar plus homes. Mainly photos with a few construction drawings, when they're available, mostly illegible. Commentary is minimal, but a nice touch is the summary list of specifics: external siding material, etc., that spares you having to read through meaningless commentary."
5,"A funny, romantic, full-of-culture classic!","Nigerian books are not exactly what one would call ""popular"" with a Western audience, but when books like ""The Bride Price"" are available, it is very hard to understand why. ""the Bride Price"" is a touching story of a young girl Akun-na, and her family. After her fathers death Akun-na must fight a sexist society in order to be with her own true love, Chike. The author Emecheta is a sociologist, and this comes out in the novel. Varous parts of Nigerian culture are shown to us poignantly and concisely. The book is written for a Western audience and comes across clearly. It is an excellent read for those wishing to learn about African culture, and should perhaps be on a required book list for highschoolers. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a short, funny, romantic classic"
3,The Bride Price,"The ""Bride Price"" by Buchi Emecheta is an informative insight into the culture, traditions and history of the Nigerian peoples and as a whole, is well served as an introduction to the rich customs and heritages of Africans. I must admit that the ending, while it was not necessarily suprising, was a bit disappointing and seemed to sort of fizzle out. While the over-all theme that I detected, that being the inability of the African people to remove themselves from their cultures, families and religious and secular traditions (not that such is desirable), regardless of lingering influence from Western domination, was in a sense captured by Emecheta's choice of an ending, although I feel it could have perhaps been handeled better, with more of a twist. However, in ultimate value this novel is a easy and enjoyable read, with an, at times captivating story line that is deeply intertwined, once again in the culture and traditions of the African and specifically Nigerian people."
2,The Bride Price,WARNING. This book was published under 2 different covers. Was purchased for my child's literature class and I purchased the wrong cover!!!! You'll most likely want the GREEN cover...
3,"Sad, thoughtful, and full of truth.","This book makes the reader think seriously about the importance of preseving tradition in a changing world, and the high cost of that preservation."
3,Top CD but incomparable to the film,"To be blunt - its a good CD if you are a major fan of the film. However, most of the tunes are good only as backing music to classic Michael Caine acting, and lose a lot when played alone. There are one or two good tracks, suck as Matt Monros opening song 'On Days Like These' and the 'Self-Preservation Society' from the end of the film. Listening it through you'll recognise many parts but none of the other tracks are paticuarluy noteable on their own. As part of a CD soundtrack they rock but each one isnt brilliant. I guess it all depends if you were a major Italian Job fan."
1,Garbage,"Poorly written instructions for formatting a word document.The tabs are not height perforated equally (each row is a slightly different height), the tabs on the second column of the sheet donot accurately height match the tabs on the first column. As a result column 1 row 9 has a greater height than column 1 row 8, column 1 row 9 also has a greater height than column 2 row 9.I am only able to print the first 3 tabs on each column correctly.Buy the Avery brand instead."
3,not impressive,"no real value for $31.Book presents quite accurate information on teaching the lifts, but some pictures show wrong positions.Contrary to Everett's book, the title clearly states that the book is for beginners. The third star is strictly for this honesty."
5,Excellence from the master,"Not only is this a literary gem, it is one of the books that prompted me to begin writing. Tom tells a great story and not many authors can compare with the masterful crafting of his works. This was my first exposure years ago to his books. On re-reading, it still stands as a classic and was one of the reasons I began writing. Tom was the mentor of our class. No one compares. His compassion comes out in everything he does, including Faraway Places. This short work demonstrates Tom's ability to capture the rural angst and family dynamics that may have escaped the vast majority of us. It is superlative writing and a great complex story written with heart and Spanbauer's ability to set the scene, bringing the reader exactly to the place he wants.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
1,Doesn't work on Vista,"I bought this for my new laptop with no parallel port, which is running Windows Vista. Unfortunately, as of today (4/26/07) this cable only comes with drivers for Windows 98 and Windows XP, not Windows Vista. I tried installing the XP driver, but to no avail. Buy a different cable if you have Vista or or planning on upgrading to Vista."
2,USB printer cable,"The product was not compatible with Vista, the seller took back the return and I paid shipping both ways. It would have been helpful if the seller had indicated that it did not work with Vista."
3,Mixed Reactions,"I ordered this book mainly because i liked Mr. Mack's run on daredevil and especially his superbly painted covers. I was mildly dissapointed. Don't get me wrong, the story is gripping, but not extremely so, but the artwork is not all that, if you know what i mean. This being Mr. Mack's first such work must be taken into consideration though, and i have orderd the next volume and hope that it will be better art-wise.Another problem with this sort of book though is that you can't help comparing it to similar books with Japanese authors (Blade of the Immortal springs to mind), and in such comparison this book is surely to be lacking."
3,"A fast, fulfilling read","This slim yet satisfying narrative caught me off guard with its subtle prose and striking wisdom. Henry Grunwald writes with a journalist's precision, weaving a case for slowing down to enjoy life's little details. Reading this book will only take you a couple of days, but it just might change your life."
4,A wonderful book,"I received this book as Christmas present and read it in a couple of hours. Recently at the age of 43, I experienced retinal detachment in one eye with the risk of the same in the other eye. Grunwald's writing, with its humor about his predicament, and his thoughtful analysis of how his life has (and has not) changed, really touched me. I recommend it to anyone with low vision or anyone living with someone with low vision. The book is available on tape from the Lighthouse Foundation, by the way (according to a newspaper article I read)."
4,Value for sufferers and doctors,"My mother has macular degeneration and needed this book on tape. .... My mom found the book to be very helpful. I also read it to try to understand better what she deals with every day. She also purchased 2 copies of the book in hardcover for her eye specialists. Although they know all the medical information already, the book can give them insight into their patient's plight. I recommend the book to anyone who knows or works with someone with low vision."
1,Why not on CD?,"This is not a review per se in that I have not read the book. However, I wanted to buy it on CD for my father-in-law, who is 89 years old and HAS macular degeneration. As a result, he is now unable to read at all. It is peculiar to me that this particular book is not available on CD since many in its target audience would likely be victims of the degenerative eye disease that is its topic. Are there plans to put it in an audio format?"
3,Warfare in the ancient world,Pretty good general survey from which I learned plenty. I would have liked more on cavalry and why it didn't get really dominant until the Mongols.
1,Poor introduction to a well published subject,There are far better introductions to warfare in the ancient world. Make a search here at Amazon and read the reviews. This one have many errors.
1,Very bad,"Well, in my opinion, this product is very bad, the second time that I washed all the color came out. I think is no stainless steel."
2,Falling apart,"The plastic lids are really tight, which would be a good thing normally, but in this case can cause the bowls themselves to crack. I've had this set just a month and one bowl is already cracked. I'd not purchase these again."
5,Respects both your time and your intelligence.,"This review is short and sweet, just like Forkner's book. In computer books, less IS more. Forkner does two things especially well here: he tells you just what you need to know, and then he tells you why you need to know it. When you care, you remember. Forkner's is a seasoned insider's view, served up with genuine enthusiasm for networks in general and NT in particular. He understands that setting up and administering computers is not only algorithmic (like a recipe); it's also holistic (like chess or psychiatry). Because concepts last longer than technology, I found this book still quite useful when setting up Windows 2000 Server."
3,Very good no-nonsense beginner's guide,"I have bought several WindowsNt books on how to help set it up as a server and this is the book I turn to first; if I need more detail I then check out my WindowsNT Resource book - thick as a phonebook and tedious reading. I gave only 3 stars because of this book's lighter format, but weighing it on its own merits and its design goals it deserves 4.5"
4,Great writing.,"This is a very good book, and the writing, particularily in the final chapters, is heartbreaking. The narrative arch is a little disjointed, though.Warren's Flood or The Cave are much more powerful."
1,this one was broken,"We are contantly resetting and as the light goes down so does the picture quality. Sometimes just dots you have to guess. Someone else in the family has two of these and is not having the problem, only reset once a week and has it on a timer.So there must be something wrong with our camera and we will see what Amazon will do to make this right."
2,"OK product, horrible service","The product works fine and links into my home wireless network fine. However, I had trouble setting up remote internet use so I called the helpline, waited 15 minutes then someone said that they were very busy and I should leave my number for a call back. I got a call back the next day while I was at work. So I called again and it was the same process over again. When i finally spoke to someone, i received a lot of demeaning tech mumbo jumbo. I am still not set up fo remote use and have been unable to reach a service agent a second time. If you are good with tech stuff, it's maybe a good buy, but if you need support, fuggedaboutit!!"
3,ok camara in day of course,ok camera in the light day of course. Paid 169.99 for the wireless needed a router! They finally told me the router has to have the same IP address as the camara!Had to call trendnet numerous amounts of times in order to get help. TERRIBLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT!They told me the web IP camera only emails you pics. That was a lie it does both records long video and send pictures! The only thing that this cam does not have led night vision lights & sounds. Otherswise it will get the job done!
1,Fails after an hour. Very poor tech support.,"If the product worked, it would be fine, but it locks up after about an hour of use.I phoned tech support. They took 20 minutes to pick up. The tech was very difficult to understand. He told me that he couldn't help me, but if I wanted to RMA it would take 3-4 weeks. The RMA process did not work and I have not received a replacement.Nice."
1,NOT wireless,"Item is described as WIRELESS. It is NOT WIRELESS. Turns out the TV-IP400W is wireless, not this TV-IP400, with no ""W""!"
2,wireless camera,It wouldn't be fair to write a review on an Item that I neverwas able to see.I wasn't able to install this item.
