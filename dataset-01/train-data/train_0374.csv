3,Benitez & Nebula/Night Life,"This is a Very good album (Music). The CD was less to be desired. It was defective. I replaced it once. I told ""latinspecialist"" about it. They never got back with me to replaced it again. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
5,You will want one for each of your friends............,"This is a wonderful new book. It is not only good reading for gardeners, but also for those who are not. Each ""musing"" is short and straight forward. And each one leads the reader to think about how they contribute in their own community. Each thought brings a smile as a simple observation takes on a wider implication, and gives the reader a clearer understanding of ones own purpose."
4,Giddiyap!,"If you enjoy Western music, this is the CD for you. You can practically see the sagebrush! This CD will transport you to the Old West with instrumental renditions of movie and TV Western themes. So saddle up, and happy trails!Note: Don't be swayed by the one-star review preceding this one. To date, the only ""reviews"" Mr. Ospino has submitted to Amazon are for Esteban CD's: 11 IDENTICAL paragraphs in which he changed only the title. Enough said."
2,Cheesy Accompaniment,"I like Esteban and all, his playing on this album I like, but the cheesy accompaniment has got to go! It sounds like something my 5 year old niece put together on her keyboard. I am really disappointed because I love these old west favorites and was expecting more. It would have been a lot better if he had just played these songs like he normally does: acoustic guitar with string ensemble (maybe) accompaniment."
1,And all the spirits are gone after hear this cd!,"STOP! Hey before you buy this cd, let me tell you something: This is not a Spanish Guitar player, not even a Spanish like one. This guy is just a begginer-like player, he's harmonically and technicaly handicapped. Somebody has to stop this guy. Tell him the truth: You can't play! I don't know what did he do to get his contract, but when i heard this cd, this came to me: He's the William Hung of the Guitar, that maybe learned to play with the AKORDES tuition software. Not even him would buy this cd! I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH! PS: if you dont know who william hung is, visit his site: [...] ."
4,Cleaned up and remastered.,"Kris benefits more than anyone I know with the remastering of some of his recordings. The origional hits on this album sounded flat but now sound fresh and clean. This is not a greatest hits package of course, yet some of his early hits are included, eg, 'Help Me Make It Through The Night', 'Me and Bobby Mcgee' among others. There are also 4 songs never released before this album all well worth a listen. If you're a Kris fan and have his origional albums, you might want to go for the remastered versions , they're certainly worth it."
5,An American Milestone,"This is a unique, one-of-a-kind album, a landmark recording by a tremendous artist at the peak of his creative genius.You better have some affinity for the down and out, however, as this record is populated with drunks, junkies, bums, losers, hippies, the loved and the loveless. Kris' narrative focus is on the underdog, the marginal, the other left out or kicked out by society. His characters are on the road, bumming drinks and cigarettes, singing songs and landing in jail.The recording is spare, emphasizing Kris' lyrics, guitar, and voice. That voice. His off-key tone, over time, is mesmerizing, perfect for the characters he is singing about -- I wouldn't change a thing."
4,More comfortable than others,"Buying a replacement for the Jabra that I lost was an immediate decision. It is the only headset that I have found that is comfortable for me. Others are too big, stuffing or bending my ear or giving me a headache. The small size Jabra earbud fits my ear very well and is much easier to wear.One small complaint: The gels in the set used to be 3 different colors, coding them by size. Now all are clear, and it takes more effort to dig out the smallest ones."
2,"Bad, bad, bad!","My first 3 days with the EarBoom Winder have been very disappointing. When I make a call when driving, the ""reel"" part of the EarBoom dangles down awkwardly and sometimes gets wrapped around the gear shift. Obviously, this is not good. It takes away much (all?) of the safety of a hands-free kit. I encountered a buzzing noise when making calls. I never get this with the stock hands-free kit that ships with my Motorola V60i. Yesterday, the EarBoom stopped working. I couldn't hear anything through it. This is probably because the reel hangs down, and the wire is getting loose in its connection. I give this product a 2, and not a 1, because I did some tests and found that voice transmission was clearer with the Jabra than with my stock hands-free kit. I'm going to return this product and get a Jabra EarBroom -- without that darn winder!"
2,The Gillette Model,"Great Product, Great Performance. But can't they make a system that doesn't lose the earbud? I spend all my time retracing my steps looking for the dang things. ...If they fix that I'll give it 5 Stars."
1,nothing but problems,"I bought this headset for my husband and he has had all sorts of problems with it. He had to exchange the first unit because the ear piece came apart, exposing wires. With his second, so far, he has lost all but 1 of the EarGels because there is no way to fasten them securely - he even tried gluing one on. He traveled to Las Vegas and, having lost the EarGel on the plane, he went to a cellular phone store to buy a replacement pack. He was told by the store manager that many people come in asking for the same thing for the same reason, but that Jabra is refusing to sell the EarGels separately. They obviously don't realize what a problem it is (or what an opportunity they have to replace items so easily lost)."
4,Rockin' Good Time,Really enjoyed this true life Spinal Tap. It's got tons of emotion and sentiment and honesty. These guy's should have gone further.
4,Wow!,"With Spinal Tap, you were in on the joke. It was brilliant as a satire of the incredibly insane and sometime unbelievable world of a rock band past its prime, trying to survive. With Anvil, The Story of Anvil, you're witnessing the real thing. You watch, uncomfortably, as Anvil goes on ""tour"" through Europe, playing basement clubs in eastern Europe to about 6 people. You witness the culmination of the tour......the ""big gig"" at the end......the triumph at the ""festival crowd"" of 152 people (expected crowd - 5,000). It's compelling in the same way you slow down to see a car wreck. You feel horrible, but you can't look away. A must watch for any musician who has experience playing halls and nightclubs."
4,Be prepared...,"While this is a great film, don't expect to feel good after watching this. The whole film is mostly really depressing as you watch the lead singer desperately trying to cling to something that just is no longer there. It's interesting, and it's great to see their attitude about the situations they're in, but it's also kind of sad as you realize that this is how most bands turn out, being left behind by the music industry and all but their fiercest fans. As a musician it really pierced my heart even more so."
3,Great movie - not so great band,"Anvil was always silly and nowhere near as good as they (and some fans) think they are, even if Metallica and Slayer and others have cited them as influences. After their first two albums, things went downhill fast and the band was nothing more than a joke.However, this docummentary single-handed provides us with a microscope example of what probably happens to thousands of bands around the world (in any genre, mind you, not only in metal). It's a poignant movie, sad at some times, but at least we know the guys at least canmake a living with their other jobs.Kudos for who decided to invest in this project."
5,I love it!,"I was not heavy metal fan, but I just love this DVD and it made me cry.I realized that they have talent and really good songs. I recommend this DVD to all my friends."
2,For young children,"I am a Physical Educator for Third, Fourth and Fifth graders and ordered this book to use with them. I found that most of the activities are for younger students. The music used and the activities used are for young beginners."
4,What a suprise,This is my second copy of the book because the first was used so much the pages started falling apart. What a suprise when I received the free read-along CD with it. A must have for all grades.
4,I thought it was a great book.,The three little pigs had to leave home because their mom said they had to leave home. She said goodbye and I love you.
3,3 Little Pigs,I recommend reading this first. It is the version where the first 2 pigs are eaten and the last pig tricks the fox.
1,Kindle version is terrible,"I purchased the Kindle version of this title for my wife to use for a class that she teaches. The Kindle version is terrible. The text will sometimes repeat for 3 pages in a row or appear multiple times on the same page. The illustrations are nice, but the Kindle version of this title is confusing and unusable for young readers."
2,Depressing!,"Take this with a grain of salt because I do NOT remember this story well from childhood...was it always this...dark? I seriously don't recall. DID the first two pigs get eaten and the wolf boiled alive? If so, I guess it didn't bother me! Did the pigs' mom always send them away in tears because she could not afford to keep them? As I mom this made me sad. But again, if the story has always been this way, ignore me. The drawings are really nice!"
3,It is a good book but does not follow the traditional theme.,"Paul Galdone's book, The Three Little Pigs, is good however it does not follow the original theme of the three little pigs. In Galdone's book he has the last little pig go to the local fair, an orchard and a farm. The wolf asks the third little pig to go with him there, so that he might get a chance to eat the little pig. However, the little pig is too smart. This part of the story loses the children's interest because it is kind of boring. Not a good book to use for a retelling, because the children do not understand that there is more to this story than there is to the original story."
3,NOT salsa.,"This review is for the benefit of those thinking this album has the great sound of Sonido Bestial or Juan en la Ciudad. Well... it doesn't. It is more of a bolero album, with the characteristic drums and pianos of the era. I should have known in the title, this is more about Bobby Cruz' singing than instrumental musician's delight. Can give it a bad rating since it is not my style although I thought people should know what the album is about."
4,Pretty Easy to Understand for Spanish as a Second Language Readers,"After my third semester of college Spanish, this book wasn't overly hard to understand, but I suggest buying the book in English to make sure you are reading things correctly."
4,Great on Kindle,"It is great to have historical texts as this one, that are used so much for quotations, available as searchable text. One can make sure the quotation is in context, and avoid wading through material that is clearly out of date. Any economic inquiry, as Adam Smith'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nationsthat is more than 20 years old ignores the importance of intellectual capital, which is now more important than financial capital. But that dies not mean we can ignore them, since those texts had been read by the people now making the economic decisions for our countries. And these still form the basis for the prescription of solving today's economic woes as Laffer'sReturn to Prosperity."
2,Best of?,"This is just a collection of home-grade VHS style filming done at car shows over the US, there is no real substance to it, but fine if you want to see some cars at car shows, Definately not 'best of'..."
3,"good for fans, but not really a deep look.","Basically this is a history of the Mr. Olympia contest and who won. They touched on how things changed and the major controversies of the sport, but didn't really focus on the overall culture. They didn't discuss steroids or changes in supplements. They didn't really go into detail or show changes like Yate's turning it into size contest, or touch on why and how Cutler was able to win the olympia back, when his return was actually him turning from a yates style Mass Monster to adding a freakish amount of definition. They don't talk about the culture of it beyond the Olympia or examine the amature ranks or how bodybuilding style training affected other sports. It's great if you want to learn about the Mr. Olympia's history, but isn't really a look at how the sport has changed, which makes the ending seem like it comes out of nowhere."
3,Just memorize 50 books and you'll do fine :),"I prepared for the exam using only this book and Information Power '98, and I passed! However, I had worked in a school library as a para professional for a few years, which helped me immensely.This book does a great job of summarizing the basics, but be aware that the sample test does not resemble the real one very much. It covers the SAME THINGS but it will be worded/phrased quite differently at the exam.Actually performing on the job is one of the best preps for this test because there is NO way a person could realistically memorize all the things you need to know to pass.The test covers so much that I would recommend memorizing the basics from the XAM book and building a general understanding of the main policies. After that, there's not much you can do at the actual exam, except carefully think out each question and rely on your logic and deduction skills."
5,Garden tiller,"The tiller arived in good shape. I started it and it ranfine. I haven't used it yet, but I have great expectations.The tiller tines can rotate in both directions whichis what I wanted."
3,motor issues,"I purchased my tiller from Rural King. When I got it home and started it, it sounded like the motor was gasping for gas. It kept gunning while running and did not keep a constant speed. I also had to keep the choke almost all the way closed. If I pulled the gas lever back to slow it would die.Calling the dealer, I was told this was normal for this item. Also, once it is up to operating temperature, if you stop it, it is very hard to start. The dealer also said this was normal.I have used the tiller for three years now and it has never got any better. There is a lot of carbon around the exhaust from it running so rich but if you lean the choke it dies.Once I get it going, it does a good job, however."
1,Never received the item,I am very disappointed with the seller. The one CD I needed to listen to in order to choose music for my wedding in 2 weeks I didn't get. I paid for expedited shipping and haven't gotten a refund either!I have owned this album on tape and always loved it. Also went to George Winston concert and he was amazing.
5,The Deep-Down Soul of Christmas,"Hearing this CD in August gives you a moment of the real -- too often rare -- peace of the best side of the Christmas Season. Buy this in the middle of a busy summer if you need a dose of cool, inspirational, winter thoughts. One of Winston's best -- and that makes it the best of the best."
5,a favorite to pass on...,"My husband and I purchased this for some friends who were married this past...well...December :) It's our favorite Christmas CD...but more than that...it's beautiful, awe-inspiring, lovely music...by an immensely talented musician... I know other folks had commented about poor quality, but we have no complaints."
5,"Reflective, restful, and fun",This is the best George Winston title (In our humble opinion). It epitomizes all that Christmas is about!
5,As Someone Who Actually Teaches New Age Piano...,"As someone who actually teaches people how to play piano in this style, I highly recommend you pick up a copy of this CD. In a word, it's 'sublime' in every way. The playing, the song choice, the style ... simply the best holiday music you can get bar none! 5 stars!"
5,"Part Christmas, Part Winter Solstice, Completely Wonderful","This is my favorite of George Winston's Seasons and my second favorite of all his albums, eclipsed only by Linus & Lucy. It has new music and new takes on classic carols and traditional pieces, including Pachebel's Kanon and the Carol of the Bells. Get it. Listen to it. You'll feel the snow falling, the fire crackling, and carolers singing even in the middle of Summer."
5,A feast for the ears,"From the first track to the last December will capture your soul taking both it and your mind to places full of wonder, warmth and joy. Listening to this CD will invite you to remember past family holidays and loving intimate moments. A must for cold December nights with your lover or those family gatherings wich are full of cheer."
5,Pop perfection,"Enrique's third English album can be summed up in one word. And that's brilliant. It doesn't get much better than this. It has an even amount of ballads and rock songs. The ballads are great for clearing your mind and just sitting around and thinking about life. Nothing depressing or suicidal. Which is good. And then the rock/dance tracks are even better. Everything blends perfectly with these songs. The music is catchy, the lyrics are tongue in cheek paradise, and Enriques voice shines. This is definitly a night time album to listen to while driving in your car. It has all the perfect ingriedients for a spectacular pop album. So if you're ever in a bad mood, this cd will cheer you up completly. I guarentee it."
4,"YALL JUST MISTAKEN , THIS CD IS PRETTY GOOD","I think this cd is pretty good,i understand with all the bad reviews have beem giving, honestly it wasnt what i was expecting myself but i really thought that enrique is going to a new direction of taste in this cd... its catchy and u could get along with some of the tunes... but it dosent hurt in putting a different flavour into ur music.... and i think thats what enrique is doing, like for his two other english albums.The first one was a classic as u all know.... and the second went to another level....The 3rd is having the public shocked in the various songs that enrique is recording with a little bit of rock mixed into his latin guiter buts its all good...Rates of songs-not in love 4.5/5the way you touch me 3/5say it 5/5 I Love this songcalifornia callin 4/5addicted 4/5free 3/5be yourself 3.5/5wish u where here 4/5you rock me 3/5roamer 4/5live it up tonight 2.5/5adicto 4.5/5"
5,super CD,"i LIKE IT cd VERY WELL. I think that this CD is the best of all. I like the song ""Addicted""."
4,80's rock,"this is a great cd, it is very 80's sounding. enrique's voice with acoustical guitar. i love it"
3,good,"""Say it"" and ""not in love"" are two better songs than the sngle ""addicted"" and this album is worth the 17 dollars i had paid for."
5,enrique,enrique is at his best in this new creative cd. the song addicted is wonderful and emotional including an english and spanish version. the songs will have you up and dancing with pure joy.
4,I'll keep giving Seven a chance...,"I have had the cd for two weeks now and although I am a big fan of Enrique, Seven has yet to grow on me. For some reason I can't pinpoint why I haven't been able to connect with this album like his previous six.My favorite songs so far are California Callin' and Be Yourself mainly because I like the semi-techno beats."
4,Passionate,"I did not expect this CD to be this good! I blindly bought it because I've seen how Enrique sings/performs with passion and in a deeply felt manner. This one is no exception; I love all but 2 tracks. Say it, Wish You Were Here, Addicted, Roamer, & Free are my absolute favorites. The CD can't seem to leave my car player."
5,He Does It Again,"Once again Enrique manages to switch up his style, remaining fresh and to those that actually listen to his music, ""not corny."" Like many of Enrique's cds you have to hear it a few times to fully enjoy the catchy songs. All the songs with the exeption of track 12: live it up tonight, are amazing. You can let the entire cd play out, its that good. For his english cd's this one is just as good as Escape and Enrique. This is proof that Enrique has not lost his musical edge and his ability to make good cd's.The best songs on the album are:california callinaddicted (and adicto)be yourselfyou rock meroamer (my favorite)"
5,A tone from our life,i guess one of the hardest things to do is to give your own point of view about a great record like 7...it's not about the melodies and the lyrics only..but the secret of it is how they are mixed up togeter with enrique's mellow voice in a great harmony that makes you feel every word you hear..7 has a new way in composing music that makes you feel the song is alive...also all the lyrics you feel they are comin' from somethin' happend with us in our lives..I really think 7 is an exclusive hit.
4,It's okay but his previous release Escape was better.,"I just bought this cd last week and although I like his music...I still like his previous english release ""Escape"" better. It is still worth my time but I prefer to listen to his previous ones. Also, try Michelle Branch's ""Hotel Paper,"" that's a great cd to listen to."
1,No!,"""Dude,will you just go away?"" - Taken from my Gazette,and I'm totally for it!I don't understand why I have to give this 1 star."
2,A Few Good Songs,"This album is OK. There are a few songs that save it from being a total disappointment. If you're a big fan than I'd say get it, you'll probably aquire a taste for it. The more I listen to it the less terrible it sounds. If you just started listening to him since his last album (Escape) I'd recommend staying away from this one. It doesn't even come close.I think he attempted to become too ""Pop"" in some of his songs here and lost the smooth Latin sound he's known for.Gave this 2 stars for the few songs that are really 5 star quality."
4,"The music OK, him, not OK","The rock music in his CD is just fantastic but he should stick to singing in spanish. You could barely understand what he's saying but The Way You Touch Me and Not In Love are cool and it shows another side of Enrique. I never thought he could be like that. Free shows that other side of him, overall the CD was awsome."
2,"Good idea, but is Enrique stuck in 1989?!","I haven't heard the album, but I could tell from hearing the song Addicted. It sounded like an overwrought 1989 heavy metal band power ballad. Enrique just doesn't pull it off on this song. It doesn't match with the best of his songs either. I heard some of the other songs--it has that '80s feel, but he doesn't connect with the essence of that decade. Has Enrique run out of songs to write long after that Hero megasuccess? He needs to keep up on that pace rather than turn into some retro mode like he's doing now. I don't mind artists taking chances or risks, but don't sacrifice being in 2004 while your mind is stuck in a time warp doing this '80s retro thing. Sorry if I'm rough, but Enrique's idea for the Seven album just doesn't make sense."
1,this album sucks!,hey .. this is the worst enrique iglesias album ever .. i totally hate all of his songs ..ther are all boring.. why dont you try buing his first 2 albums ?? ( enrique & vivir ) .. thar are good ones.. thanx bye
5,The absolute best!!,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and it melts my heart!! Addicted and Roamer are awesome!"
1,This is NOT the Kodaly Missa Brevis,"Don't get your hopes up! Despite being labelled by AMAZON as the ""KODALY: MISSA BREVIS"", this is actually the Liszt Missa Choralis. This CD actually only contains a single movement from the Kodaly Missa Brevis: The Agnus Dei."
4,"Very interesting book, but beware of errors.","I am presently building the chair explained in the book. The book is very well written an helpful if you have never built a chair before, but beware there are many (many although the author does not recognize the mistakes) mistakes in the measurements. MEASURE TWICE- READ ALL THE REFERENCES in the book which relate to each piece, or you will have to buy extra wood to recover from these mistakes. There is a set of plans for the chair which you MUST buy or from the tiny pictures from the book will not be able to accomplish the project.The book itself has plenty of pictures (all black and white except for a gallery of chairs). The cover seems to deliver better quality pictures than it actually does.The title should say ""Building A classic chair"" since it only explains how to build just one model. But remember, get the plans, and re-read the book back and forward before cutting any part and buying the wood."
4,this shoe is sexy .,"This galvin wedges is so sexy and chick i am just loving it , i am glad that i purchases, i am thinking of buying another color. I just Love It."
3,Knowledgable,This book is definately a classic text books. Not exciting but full of information. If you are a fan of ancient Rome and or Gladiators of ancient times then this book is full of excellent insights.
5,Plate wall hangers,"I have looked all over the city for these plate hangers and had been unable to locate exactly what I wanted. I was very pleased to have found it on Amazon. It was easy, quick and I didn't have to spend time and gas!"
1,Decided not to open,"Had one of these for ""years"" and it was a great lock, but like all things it had its day. I searched for one just like it and here it is. I highly recommend this lock. CANCEL MY RECOMMENDATION, I WOULD NOT NOW RECOMMEND THIS LOCK!!!!!Had this lock now for a year and one day it decided that it no longer cared to open and I had to get it CUT OFF! Multiple attempts with the combination failed to open it. It worked fine up until that day. NO WAY would I buy one of these today, the quality just doesn't seem to be there like it used to."
3,"Sways way to much, go with a roof rack instead","I originally purchased this bike rack because of the overwhelming reviews on Amazon. However, when I finally put the rack and bike onto the car, it felt unstable. I drove it about 10 miles on the freeway, and watched it sway a little in my rear view mirror. What's worse is that the bottom support foam was sitting on my bumper and caused my bumper to sag. This product does not work very well for the Lexus IS300.I use this in conjuction with the Yakima Crossbeam Adapater, with my girlfriends women's bike. The crossbeam did not hold the frame enough and caused the bike to sway while on the rack.I ended up purchasing a roofrack with the Yakima King Cobra instead. Around $380 used price, i was way more satisfied with that solution.If you must a trunk rack, I heard the Saris version is better (but it rests on your bumper, so that may be an issue for some cars)."
2,LG LFD750 - Micro system radio / DVD - glossy black,"I have owned this product for approx 6 months.Every time I use it, I am annoyed that I spent $[...] for this.Anyway:Pros:*Good sound*Good video*Looks sexy*Ipods work with the provided cable.Cons:*Slow cd/dvd ""read"" to ready to ""play"" time*The on system control buttons sometimes need to be pressed multiple times for them to work.*USB-hahaha a joke. NOT even a feature I try to use anymore. I have tried basic 1 gb mp3 players (Creative Zen Nano)- some content is read, other content is somehow not found by the stereo. It wont pick up my new Creative Zen 8gb at all. My external hard drive (WD My Book) doesn't work on it either.*The unit has only 1 set of RCA cable plug ins and 1 component plug in; granted, this is only a bookshelf system."
5,Paving the way,"Your book is wonderful. It is giving me a blessed feeling of normalcy among all mothers...the feeling I get is of acceptance and of us all being in this same patriarchal boat together doing the best we can. It is refreshing to me after years of being an LLL leader and having my own issues with judgment and shame. I really appreciate what you've done, especially the very clear way you have written about women, femininity, biology, and work in our culture. The more we can do to pave the way for motherbaby togetherness and paid work, the better."
5,The Best Way to Learn,"is to hear what happened to a friend when they were learning to do what you want to try. Behrmann supplies a lot of those friends, in print form. She's organized the stories in a useful way if you have a particular concern, but the book reads wonderfully straight through."
5,"rare, remarkable performances","If you know and like the pieces included on this cd, buy it. That simple. I thought this cd was out of print... nowhere to be found. I've been listening to it for 15 years and treat it like gold. The most valuable track, in my opinion, is #8: Sharon Isbin performing the Chaconne on the guitar. My guess is that very, very few people know about this recording, and it is absolutely breathtaking. Literally. I now have more than 20 versions of the Chaconne, including several violinists, guitarists, pianists, even an orchestral version, so I feel qualified to provide my strongest recommendation. As a benchmark, I will add the following: if you enjoy Segovia's and/or Williams' performance of the Chaconne (both of whom did it, I believe, in well under 14 minutes), be prepared to listen with an open mind. Isbin's performance, in my opinion, is unparalleled (among guitarists). Julian Bream's performance is just a hair short."
3,McCalls Cookbook,Book is in only fair condition with some food stains. Not all recipes were included. The one I was seeking was not in this binder.
2,Not a good battery,"This battery wont hold a charge very well. I have been using it for months and it never has worked unless you have it on the charger, then it only last a short time."
1,Do now work as well as EZO's,"Bought these for my Mom. She says they are not as comfortable as EZO's, which are no longer manufactured. They just don't work for her."
5,greta album,"This album is hella tite!Its got beats better then Beyonce and vocals better then JoJo.This girl has phunk!This songs are so pop/RnBIts a great album.I will swear on the bible that if you buy this album you will love it.I will swear you will love this cd, if you dont you can find me a decapatate me.Sound fair?"
3,OK album that's hardly worthless but does have a couple of weaknesses,"Keshia Chante (born as Keshia Harper in 1988) is an obscure, Canadian-born contemporary R&B/hip-hop singer. Among the strengths of Keshia and this album are: She's VERY cute, and many of the songs are cute, likeable, and utterly harmless in their subject matter. Standouts include the short but nice ballad ""Little Things"" and the slightly more uptempo ""Can't Believe,"" which has a suprisingly good original background. On the weaker side of things, some familiar-sounding samples do pop up from time to time, her singing ability is average, and she really has no distinctive style, with many of the songs not sounding much different from the stale tripe that people like Rihanna, Ciara, and Beyonce make us endure."
2,More bad than good,"Wow. What can I say about this movie?The good: Most of the fight scenes range from good to very good. I guess you could say that the premise of the story was pretty good. Interesting concept for a Chinese production company to film a martial-arts film in America. This movie could have been very good, except for a few things.The bad: The dubbing was HORRIBLE. The absolute worst I have ever experienced in a Kung-fu film.Also, one of the more glaring issues I had with this film was the lack of attention to detail. This film is supposed to be set in the Old West, but the clothes on some of the Caucasian men in the film, scream mid-to-late 70's. Some of the guys looked like they came straight from a biker flick. Did T-shirts had tags in the back in the Old West? If they did, then I apologize.I dunno. I can't recommend this flick. If you can stomach the bad to experience the good...give this a try. But you might be sorry."
3,Not nearly as nice as they look,"When I bought these, I certainly had higher expectations. Not only are they 5"" heels (hard to find), but they have a great sophisticated look. The boots I received were a far cry from the image in my head. Don't get me wrong, I'm pleased enough to keep them. I just hoped for a bit sturdier workmanship. The biggest problem is the toe. With even a fairly narrow foot inside, the toe becomes misshapen. It bulges and bends in odd places. At times, it looks like the area around the big toe will split if trod on wrong. The flimsy sole might have something to do with this. It appears to be nothing more than an alarmingly soft flap of vinyl. Try to imagine high-heeled shower sandals and you'll get my point.These boots appear to be meant as costume apparel, not streetwear.Please be absolutely certain these are the boots you want before purchasing - the return policy of this seller is horrible."
1,WAY TOO MUCH COMPILATION HITS OUT THERE FOR THE GUESS WHO!,"I don't think this isn't much said for a mini retrospective greatest hits CD album. I've got a few of these songs on my 3 double single compact disc box set of ""The Ultimate Collection"" by Burton Cummings and The Guess Who from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Canada's very own rock'n roll band ever conquered the psychedelic sixties music world in history. It's definitively classic rock so take my advice do not get this one it is a huge stinker to me in my opinion. Get the box set buy it instead. It sounds much better and digitally remastered from it's original recordings from this artist. So I give it ""TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN!""."
1,Avoid it by all means!,"Bought it because it looked better than the only other option they had at the place I wet the night after my wife complaint about not being able to sleep because of me keeping the light on.Bulky on the back. Stupid design that wont allow you to adjust it horizontally but only the tip of it which is useless and doesn't really reach the bottom of the page. Needless to say you can't illuminate the other page at all so (since I am lazy enough not to unhook the thing from the right side and hooking to the left -front- cover of my book for EVERY page -and because I simply shouldn't have to!!!-) I find my self half closing the book bringing the left page to a 90 degrees angle from the right one to have barely enough light to read it. The ""robot like"" arm is just a stupid little thing that they though would be cool but NEVER tested the product I guess because it is useless! I saw it here while looking for a replacement. I am serious, AVOID IT!"
3,The movie was better,"What can I say? The book doesn't fall all that close to what Hitchcock did with the movie. I know generally it's the other way around but the movie was so intriguing I suppose I set my expectations too high! Still, a good read!"
5,It's Not The Usual Novel,"I've become pretty blase with most novels that I read. They are stylistically the same so often, with a lot of phony action or angst that I'm supposed to know in my soul or some such. To me those are the usual middle-class to rich kid books with clever inventiveness attached. But a couple of weeks ago I came across a New Yorker that had an essay by Dagoberto Gilb that was so beautiful to read that I decided to go out and buy his books. At first I wasn't sure waht his novel wanted to do, where it was going, but then I realized I wasn't supposed to care about that. it's about as character drawn and plot driven as a poem. The language at first seems unpolished, but it only seems that way. This is a really well written book that made me think about more than just El Paso, Texas and the Mexican border. It reminded me of the book ""The Stranger"" by Camus--when I was done both, I felt a similar way."
3,My opinon of Mickey,"The Last known residence of Mickey Acuna takes place in El Paso, Texas. The detail in this book is very vivid. With many decriptions of the desert and El Paso heat. Mickey is a vagabondfrom different parts of Texas. He has traveled to California and has spoken about spending time in Hollywood for a while.Mickey stays in different cheap hotels and sometimes sleeps on the streets. The other characters in the story are well described with The Sarge being the most dramatic person descibed. Overall The last known residence of Mickey Acuna is somewhat slow. With some spurts of excitement, but most of the time there was more dialouge than story."
5,"great multi-tool, one of the best.","If you want quality, a tank of a tool, and the best finish in the business, get a SwissTool. It is big and heavy, not for your pocket, but it does the job, and it'll last. It won't rust or break on you (so the people who have it for awhile say). Wonderful tool opening, without taking out all the rest and you can take them out without having to open up the pliers. The tools/blades lock very nice and it has great scissors, better than most. I would recommend this multi-tool to anybody."
5,It is what you'd expect from Victorinox multitool,"This is a great tool. There is only one item missing that I truly wish were on board - a metal file. Such an addition would allow the maintenance of larger tools such as an ax or hatchet.However, aside from a metal file, the wood saw works every bit as well as those I've used on their wonderful knives. It is truly a well made tool and one that you would expect from the folks who produce the world's most innovative and rugged knives."
5,Solid multi tool,"Once I received my RS, I gave away all my Leatherman multi-tools to my friends. I could automatically tell the difference in quality just looking at it. All of the tools have a smooth travel to its locking point and the lock won't jiggle once in place. I've used this tool for outdoor use (cutting rope, crimping metal, making edges on sticks, undoing knots), on music gigs (Cutting instrument strings, measuring tape, punching holes, opening beer bottles, opening battery compartments), and at work (stripping wire, opening and breaking down boxes, measuring rope, cutting tangled rope, fixing gates, opening drains) and it has never let me down. I would highly recommend the Victorinox RS over any other multi tool on the market."
5,Good quality instrument,"I bought it and I end up using it a lot more that I would think. Very good quality tool, solid and reliable. I gave one to my father and another one to my father in law, they love it as well."
5,One of the best knives I have ever owned,"I have owned the RS for over four years now and I could not be happier. I have owned several multitools from other manufacturers that don't even come close to the kind of quality that Victorinox puts into the RS. For example, I frequently take my RS with me when I dive (SCUBA). As most people who live near the ocean know, the salty air is extremely corrosive. The Leatherman I purchased before my RS became practically unusable after only 6 months (rusting completely locked the blades in one arm of the tool). In contrast, my RS is still hanging in there after several years of enduring the same conditions.That said, the knife is obviously not indestructible; however, with the proper care, it can last you a very, very long time."
4,Quick delivery,I was surprised that the order was shipped so quickly and it was received within a week. Chapeau!
3,sweet looks/shallow mind,"Really nice looking tool, but it doesn't have the features and usability that the competition does. Too hard to get the knife out and other tools. locking feature doesn't work as well as Gerber. I think Gerber and Leatherman have better utility for less money."
4,Good Travel Tool,...good travel tool that should be thrown into the suitcase of every vigilent traveler...or the backpack of the sportsman...or the back of the land rover or ford pick-up...
3,Ok - nothing special,"I like my SwissTool RS, but not impressed. It a little bulky and heavy but has all the gadgets I want. I like the carrying pouch. I threw this in my glove compartment of my car and only use it when needed. It comes in really handy for times when you are away from home and don't have the right tool.Overall, not a bad buy. No remorse."
1,Wayfair LLC may send you something completly different!!!!,"Ordered the SwissTool RS and received a red pocket knife!!! I'm sure the Swiss Tool RS is a great tool as all of the Victorinox products I've owned have been. Not happy at all, Customer service has been fine with Amazon but not so much with Wayfair LLC. I maybe stuck with a charge on my card or a red pocket knife I don't want..."
5,Victorinox RS tool,"Good tool. Very comparable to the some of the Leatherman mid size to large tools. I think this tool is more geared to an office setting whereas the Leatherman is more for hard outdoor use. Nevertheless, this is a strong well built tool that will last a long time. Definitely worth buying if you need a multi tool for work in an office setting."
5,Love the product didn't know case was included,GREAT PRODUCT!! Victorinox SwissTool RS didn't know case was included ORDERED AN ADDITION CASE TO GO WITH MY GIFT Victorinox SwissTool RS .
3,A bit disappointed,I did not find this materials as helpful as others I have purchased in my quest to learn Hebrew. I do not want to sit at my computer and just hear words. I need more structure in order to learn. This may be my problem. It was not expensive.
4,Fun book,"This book has alot of interaction to your study. It has cards, stickers to learn words around the house, little cards to take to the restaurants, for ordering. All in all a good book to help you start learning to speak Hebrew. It does very little in helping you learn to read.I found it a great book for the price!"
3,10 minutes a day,This book is good but it would be even better with a cd to hear how to sound out the words.
3,Cute but flimsy,"This was cute for my daughter's cowboy birthday party, but was a little hard to keep inflated - sort of top heavy"
4,Ravager,The only reason I tracked this movie down is that I am trying to collect what may be considered a collection of The Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies. After viewing it all I have to say is that it will fit perfectly with those I already have. :)
1,Poor Construction,"I've purchased two of these. Both have broken within months of purchase. The earpiece case is made of two pieces, which seperate from each other all too easily. Simply pulling the earboom out of its snug fitting will cause the case to split. The sound quality is adequate and the self-retracting design is great for eliminating tangles but I can't bring myself to purchase a third one.I'm embarrassed that I was dumb enough to make the same mistake *twice*..."
4,No more hanging wires,"The Jabra EarBoom Winder finally makes it possible to use a earphone without having wires hanging all over. I really like having my cell phone hooked up to an earphone set, but didn't like the wires hanging down all the time or worse yet, tangled up in my pocket. The Jabra winder keeps everything neat and handy. The only problem is the ear gels fall off when you're not looking...and later so will the foam cover for the microphone. A little double-sided tape seems to have fixed the problem for me. I think you'll like this set after you make sure the ear gel and microphone foam are secured."
5,I love it,This is exactly what I was looking for! And that is all I want to say about that. So there.
4,Good quality system,"This digital media system is designed for small to medium size rooms. It looks good, has plenty of opitons to choose from as far as ports....you can connect mulitple components to it altogether with no hassel(xbox, usb devices, ipod and more than one hdmi device, etc); you just maneuver between the input selections from the remote. Like the majority of electronics nowadays, you can control your entire media setup from just this one remote. The only downfall of this item is that it does not have a dvd player..... If you do decide to connect a dvd or bluray, just remember to connect the rca cable as well (red & white) that's the only way you will receive your audio through the television. I would highly recommend this product."
1,Not helpful at all!,"It's redundant and, for the experienced, it is standard operating procedure. The author has banked on calling it a 'system"". The ""system"" is one used for years by all fundraising professionals. A lot of wasted pages while she says the same things over and over. She repeats the concepts backwards and forwards. Sorry I bought it."
3,Not so peppermint,"OK, not as scented as I would like. The almonds do a good job of making your skin feel good though."
1,"Boring and repetitive, 'supported' by pseudo-scientist irrelevant research on animals which I found distressing.","I am currently training to be an Infant Massage instructor and this is a recommended book.However, considering the title '..Human Significance of the Skin..', the author has relied to an excessive extent on animal research to support his views, which greatly undermines the book. The first 67 pages consist of deprivation and isolation-type experiments on animals and their offspring. Following that, there are constant references to this type of research, which I do not consider to be valid in the human context. He also makes other assertions which seem rather outdated.My work will be with humans. The people reading this book are, I presume, interested in information regarding humans. Therefore observation of human behaviour, together with statistical and epidemiological studies would be far more relevant.I will be suggesting this to the International Association of Infant Massage."
1,Review of The Human Significance of the Skin,I didn't get past the first 5 pages because it was too boring. It was like being back in 10th grade biology all over again.
3,"""Complete"" inaccurate. This is only part 3","Okay, for those of you who are like me and have been looking for the Tenchi Muyo series played on Toonami, then listen up!This is it...kind of.Toonami played two different series of Tenchi Muyo! One of them was Tenchi Universe, which runs 26 episode and is produced by Pioneer. The second series was called Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki, which is what you're looking at. However, it was split up into three different ""seasons."" Season one and two were released by Pioneer, and the third one (IE this disc set) was released by Funimation. So when this box set says ""complete collection,"" it is actually only the LAST 7 EPISODES of the 20 episode series. So you'll need to look up the first two seasons from Pioneer.So if you're hoping that this disc set will complete your long journey, I regret to inform you that you still have two more seasons to find. Although, for $10, it could be worse."
1,"OVA 3, I'll pass","Classic, complete series :( just words, I was thinking maybe they got pioneers rights OVA's to 1+2. A little searching turned up unimpressive results, this is just the viridian collection re-released under their anime classics titles."
1,a confusing mess to the end of the OVA series,"This has to be one of the most disappointing finales to a series ever. Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki is technically OVA 3 and takes place after the original series. What unfolds is a complete and utter mess of a plot filled with way too many plot-points and characters, which most get brushed to the side and only appear briefly in a one episode or two. Without giving away spoilers, I will only say to be cautious with this series, and I would only recommend it to the true fans of the Tenchi series. Although I enjoyed the original OVA series, this will just leave you scratching your head in complete confusion with this follow-up. Preferably, I'd stick with either the original OVA series alone or the even better Tenchi Universe series."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I was buying this hoping that it was the beginning of the Tenchi series to find out when I watched it that it was in fact not. In reality of what this is is the OVAs. I wanted to actually start from the beginning of the series to understand the show, but this drops you in the middle of the action even though there are flashbacks. You wont understand anything, and I have yet to understand why Funimation has marketed this as the complete Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki box set.....it just clearly isn't. I hope they will eventually re-release a proper Tenchi set, til then I'll be waiting."
5,Just a question,"I am aware that there are 2 different releases of the ""complete"" Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki series on DVD. One came out in 2009 and the other came out in 2011. I was wondering what is the difference between the Viridian Collection (2009) and the Classic collection (2011), what features, previews, trailers, etc. are on each respective sets, and which one is the best one to get? Feedback A.S.A.P. is appreciated."
1,Pokemon Sticker Series 1 (Sticker & Poster).,"My kids have all 4 of this series of books, the first has a black and white poster to put all the colored sticker on. Yet when we went through them to check out the stickers, 3 of the 4 books had the same sets of stickers(54 in each book). So how DO you collect all 150? A bit of a disappointment."
5,Truly the most important message ever offered,This book is a powerful revelation that when recieved will enable a person to stand upright in christ and know who he/she is. Every Christian should read this book...
5,a revelation we all need,"Again, E.W. Kenyon writes a fresh and revelatory word from the throne of God. How important it is that we understand our righteousness or right standing with God. Religion has taught us we have to work for righteouness, when in fact our righteousness comes from Jesus the Christ. If we all would grasp this truth, we would be free indeed."
5,The best Christian book on righteousness ever written.,This is the best book on righteousness (Christian) ever written inmy opinion. I continually order copies to give away and they alwayschange lives.
4,Surprisingly good,"Smart, honest, good performances - a steal at $.99 - Far better than many that cost much more. An excellent illustration of how lives intertwine, how bizarre and simple life can be. Very intelligent film with heart, depth and humor."
3,for 99 cents it was worth seeing,This movie was ok for a small-time production. Hollywood makes a lot of movies that are much worse and charges much more for them... This one was worth 99 cents.
1,Seriously messed up!,This movie is Seriously a messed up waste of time! If you rent this I think you will regret it. I certainly did. Enough said.
4,mojave phone booth,saw this short at an international film festival in boise idaho and was blown away........ a definite must own dvd!
3,Good book but heavy with PC stuff,"Interesting and good book but he keeps telling us how wonderful immigrants are and how they revitalize cities. He mentions orientals and the businesses they start over and over but never about the Mexicans that are so much more common, with large families paying relatively little in taxes but putting a tremendous burden on local governments which in turn tax more and drive taxpayers to less ""diverse"" jurisdictions. Just look at California, the state with the largest portion of its population foreign born. Its a financial basket case. And New York can show you two smoking holes in the ground where mighty towers once stood. I wonder what Kotkin thinks about these immigrants' contribution to the new geography?"
1,documentary,"don t have subtitles in spanish... so , i can t enjoy the dvd... bad productions also, very simple. not happy"
1,Complete Sham,"This video is a complete waste of money. There is no good video or audio, no live footage, nothing whatsoever produced by the band. It is video of a group of fans who think they are industry movers, wannabes, talking about how great the band is.Duh......we know how great the band is ......and why......they are awesome writers and musicians, and put on a spectacular live show. We wanted to see some of that awesomeness in a new live video......which this product is definately not.In case you need proof: I have my copy for sale in Amazon Marketplace for 1/3 new price. Not one person has inquired.A completely useless work.JR"
2,An Interesting Choice,"Photo Draw is considerably more useful than Microsoft Image Composer, which it should replace. Ideal solution for building graphics on the web."
2,"Looks Great, Fits Bad","I must admit that when this product arrived, it was a great looking earpiece. Its slick, and it even comes with several different colored snap-ons. My excitement ended when I placed it on my ear. It just hangs there! Why on earth would anybody want to wear that?! While driving, it swings around. Moreover, the plastic piece that connects the microphone/earpiece to the hanging-ear-thingy is about 1mm thick and could be broken simply by a drop to the floor. It took about 10 seconds for me to realize that this product is going straight back to Amazon!"
1,Wrong Version,Received the item with great expectation to see Michael Caine in Cold War spy thriller.To my disapointment the Disc could not be read by the disc player.Probably a european version.
1,wrong format,I it possible that the error was mine but I don't think so. In any case the format sent me was not usable in the US.
3,Too steep for me,"My wife was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and I bought this CD (it's not a book) to learn more about her disease and treatment. Unfortunately, although it might be very worthwhile for health care professionals, I found first that only a small fraction of it deals specifically with thyroid cancers and second that it is WAY over my head technically. Luckily, I also bought other books that were very helpful."
5,One of the Funniest Records Ever!,"I bought this album in 1990 on cassette based only on the cover, thinking it to be some hard and heavy death metal to enjoy. What I found was a horrible and incompetant collection of songs which were recorded with a complete straight face, yet through the years has put me in more belly-clutching laughing fits with dozens of friends. This could be the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of extreme metal albums. The price is a bit steep, but with songs like ""Kill the Dead"" ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Gay Rights"" you cannot go wrong. TRUST. ME."
5,This is what my old swiss army knife should have been.,"I use this day in, day out for work, home, and play use. Well worth the money, and very well made. It's the world's best nail file, and much much more."
5,Excellent Value,"I am a long time multi-tool user. I have owned both Lethermen & Swiss knives. I know some folks at Leatherman and purchased their comparable product to this one to replace a Swiss multi-tool that I had been given many years ago and was wearing out some. I intend to send that back and see what they'll do for my under warranty as I broke a blade.However on this knife, I want tot point out some great features. 1) The extra blades are protected and available without opening up the pliers to get to them, this is FAR more convenient than my leatherman, and the handle is comfortable. The build quality seems to be excellent and we have been using it for a bit over a week, so I am deducing that it appears to be of the same quality as my older one which has lasted since 1998.I don't think the case will last as long as the knife.The pliers and available features are good. The instructions mention an optional set of bits and such that don't come with this model, but that is ok."
3,"The Gringo Trail, Again","As always, Karin Muller makes a good adventure statment through her solid writing. However, as an adventurer and history buff, I thought the book lacked the depth and content both the jacket synopsis and the introductory chapter might suggest.Karin provides some interesting adventures that a typical gringo trail adventurer might encounter - without fully providing her view on how historical cultures are reflected in the ""modern-day"" Inca.I scored this book with three stars because it had some entertainment value, but was disappointing overall."
1,Painfully Bad,"How such a horribly-written, aggressively uninteresting account found any publisher is beyond me; I finished the book out of sheer compulsiveness. National Geographic isn't known for fine writing, but they've outdone themselves this time: there are painful cliches and tortured metaphors in almost every paragraph. Never once did I think ""Wow--what an elegantly-crafted phrase.""This may well be the worst book I've ever read--and I felt predisposed to like it since I'm an independent traveler and I've met Muller in person.Ugh."
3,Winter Gateway,"This is an exellent book to read, while snow and ice falls from the sky. Heading to South America next year, found it to be a great starting point to plan the trip. She has a some great stories to share with others on the trip."
2,Tour guide -- not an instruction book,"This book was not what I expected. I thought it would be full of recipies and practices of Asian spas, and it is instead mostly devoted to describing various popular Asian spas. There are some recipies, but not very many. However, it is a beautifully photographed book -- and if you are studying spas themselves (or are planning a trip to Asia and are wondering which spa would suit you best), this would definitely be a book to have."
4,Teaser,"I really like this book and some of the recipes are really simple and very easy to do.However, for things like masks, some of the ingredients are so hard to find and there is no list of where to find it or even what the ingredients look like. So it is frustrating and somewhat a teaser to be able to see the product and want to make it but can't !"
4,Caddie Woodlawn,This is a book about a girl named Caddie. They live in the 1860's and on the Wisconsin frontier. The book tells Caddie's story in a gentle way.
2,not very appealing.,"This book did not appeal to me at all, there was lots of dialogue about random things of the subject, and lots of normal, normal daily things going on. Reading about someone doing her chores really isn't at the top of my list. Sure, there were some parts about a possible indian attack in there, but that's about all."
3,Tom Sawyer for girls,"I read this children's classic in my last year of elementary school, right before reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. All I could remember was how similar the two books are, and indeed looking back at both books now, they do seem quite similar in content. Both are about boisterous youngsters living in America during the mid-1800s. Both books deal with relations with family, other non-whites, school friends and school enemies, and of course, love. In this book's case, Caddie the tomboy is the joy of her father and woe of her mother. This is similar to Tom Sawyer, who constantly frustrates his aunt. This is a good book to read by both boys and girls and can easily occupy a weekend of time for most 10-year olds."
1,Disturbing,"This book was disturbing to me as a child, and I am continually surprised that it maintains its place in the girls' canon. Caddie begins the novel as an engaging tomboy, but her conversion to ""lady"" is unconvincing - especially since the conversion is produced by corporal punishment. Even as a child I was dismayed that Caddie's real character had been suppressed. At best, I believe the book is now a period piece - an illustration of what girls used to have to endure."
1,Horrible,"This book couldn't of been worse. I had to read it for a book competition and I spent two weeks trying to read it. The book has not plot it is just about a girl who is a tomboy doing different random things. One of the things ""Caddie"" did was sell something her Native American friend gave to her, it was like a belt or i don't know because the author didn't explain it very well. I usually like Newbery Honor books but this was a disgrace to the Newbery Honor system. All i'm saying is this book is terrible."
1,Trashy; a really sorry book about a tomboy,"One of the worst books I ever read in my whole entire life. Don't waste your money on this awful book. If you're thinking about buying it, then just stop and think about the value of a dollar."
5,Caddie Woodlawn,I read this book to do a review about nineteenth century children's literature in a university class. It is based on the experiences of the author's grandmother living in pioneer Wisconsin. I am sending it to my granddaughter to read. Adults would enjoy reading this book as well as children.
4,Strong girl main character,"The Newbery Award committee members seem to love a strong girl and Caddie is among the strongest. She roams and tarries with her ruffian brothers on the wild plains of Wisconsin around the time of the American Civil War. Caddie plays practical jokes on her cousin, runs to the Indians to warn of a massacre, and proudly displays an Indian scalp belt for all the town to see. Caddie finally begins to see that becoming a lady is not just learning to quilt and say the right words and wear fancy clothes."
3,Caddie Woodlawn,"Caddie Woodlawn was a well writen book. It takes you back through pioner days. This book starts out slow, but picks up the pace when her jokester uncle Edmund comes to spend some nights over or when Caddies perfect cousin Annabell comes over. Caddie Woodlawn will tell you about the life of a 11 year old girl who loves to play around in the dirt with her 2 brothers. This book will also make you laugh at the praticle jokes Caddie and her brothers play on their family members. Over all I thought it was a o.k book and it had its moments. My personal opinion of the book was that I thought it could have been better, but then again I don't really care for pionere books. If you likes the series ""Little house on the Prarie"" you will like this."
4,"It's a very good book,I really recommend this book to you.","Its one of the best books that Ive read. Its about this girl named Caddie thats a tomboy,her dad loves this but her mom dreads what she will be when she grows up. Read and find out what adventures she and her brothers go on."
5,The Greatest Book I Read As A Child,"Caddie Woodlawn is exciting, yet it teaches a wonderful lesson. I read this book when I was 8 and it was very enjoyable. I read it to my brother and younger cousins. It is very adventourous and easy to follow. I recommend this book for everyone!"
4,An Adventurous Book Everybody Should Read,"First, I thought this book might be an autobiography about Caddie Woodlawn. Then, I was thinking, what was so special about her? Then I began to read this book. Caddie was an adventurous girl that prefered to play around wildly, hunt, and make friends with Indians, which some of her neighbors didn't think this was normal for a young girl. She didn't like to plow, bake, and sew.This book expresses Caddie's feeling over other people and people who just don't understand her too well. She spreads her feeling among strangers and other neighbors.After I read this book, I realized that she was special in her own way, being a brave and couragous little girl, trying to maintain her own world."
4,Exotic!,"I first thought the book looked amusing and it was. I liked this book after the first chapter. It started out with much information, then it built with a lot of action. This is a story about a young girl who had gotton sick when she was a child. She was made to play with the boys and become like a boy. My favorite part was when Caddie set off to tell her Indian friends to go away for a while or they would get hurt. It is a very climatic part in the book. I liked the ending of this book because it leaves you to wonder. It makes you think, ""What happened after that?"""
4,Tomboy Caddie,"Caddie Woodlawn is a spectacular book. Caddie Woodlawn was the dream of her father and the dread of her mother. She was a tomboy who played with her bothers and helped her father mend clocks. She's also friends with the Indians that live across the river. When Uncle Edmund comes, he picks Caddie to come hunting with him because she is good at spotting things. When her family gets news that the Indians are going to massacre, all of the neighbors come to stay at the Woodlawn's house. Caddie over hears some of the neighbor men saying that they are going to attack before the Indians do, so Caddie gets on one of the horses and goes off to tell the Indians to leave. Caddie Woodlawn is a fast paced and exciting book. Read the book to find out if the Indians or the Woodlawn's neighbors ever do attack or massacre."
4,Very pleased!,"This is the version I wanted! The new version is the very same story, but different illustrations. It was important to have this version...with these illustrations; because this is the one I read to my daughter when she was little. It was her favorite book to read at bedtime. She got this for me for Mother's Day this year--I loved it...very sentimental..."
4,good rock - arrived early,great voice on this lead singer ! Including a foul mouth on most of his intros to the songs !!Live at the Gods Festival 2002
5,Better in person,I bought this for my mom's upcoming birthday. She has wanted nesting stacking dolls for a few years now. I received it very quickly and perfectly packaged. It has great detail and so FUN to find doll after doll after doll. Can't WAIT to give it to my mom. She will be soo happy!Thanks!
3,Good quality but not what it seemed from picture...,"I don't know if anyone else got the impression I did but I thought, based on the picture, that the ends were fixed in the curved position that they show in the picture (like wire or something) and that I would be able to bend the ends around to fix it to the car seat handle, etc. That is NOT the case. It's a string with wooden flowers, etc on it. There is no way to fix it to anything so I ended up using rubber bands. My baby didn't seem all that enthralled with it contrary to the other glowing reviews. It is very nice, though and maybe when he's bigger I'll try it again. Overall, though, not for us. I ended up getting something different for him that he loves so this kind of ended up being a bad purchase for us."
3,Not washable...,"This toy comes in a box, which is not enclosing it, yet there are no recommendations on cleaning. I washed it in soapy water without immersing, rinsed it under running water and left to dry. Even after this first wash the wood on one side turned dark. After 4 more washes the faces on the flowers are almost completely gone. It is an infant toy - it has to be washable! Another inconvenience is the ties - they were not long enough to wrap around our car seat handle and even if I attached it around one side, it would come undone as soon as my daughter would pull on it. In the end I had to attach it with rubber bands. On the positive side - my daughter loved this toy for quite a while, when she was 6 months or so she would occupy herself with it for 20-30 minutes in the car, which is quite unusual for her. Now that she is 1, she almost lost interest in it."
5,The BEST Beginner's & Intermediate Guide to In-Line Skating,"The most complete guide on, comprehensive step-by-step, In-Line skating lessons. It takes you from beginner to advanced intermediate in the safest way. The fear of falling is gone; you learn how to fall and get up properly. The Yoga poses are very helpful for balance, strength and increased range of motion. Chapter 7 teaches you how to stay fit with ""roll-aerobics"". Key terms, skate maintenance, safety, etc. are all covered. If a DVD on the skating techniques accompanied the guide on ""GET ROLLING"" it would obliterate every in-line skating manual."
5,Fabulous!,I am a Kindergarten teacher and this story CD has been a rest time favorite ever since I purchased it. The music is relaxing and a wonderful introduction to classical music and how music can create a feeling and mood. The story is so intriguing and the voices for the characters are contagious. My students often immitate the big toad.
5,Wondeful voice characterizations,"We checked this out from the library on a whim. Years later it is our gold standard to which we compare other tales recorded by actors on audio CD.Kelly McGillis enchants with voices for each character that are so unique and so appropriate it is hard to believe she is the only actor performing. Her narration is soothing and calm, while each of Thumbelina's encounters are filled with emotion.Mark Isham's instrumentation is a wonderful pairing / partnership and we enjoy listening to the audio only tracks almost as much as the story telling track."
5,Great Albert Finney Version,"This remake never gives a clue that it is a remake, as the great Albert Finney, who's make many great films including Night Must Fall, envelopes himself in the character of Hitler of the Lower Fifth. I now see where Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf got it's theme; this is the more realistic version of the Albee play. You can feel the emotions Finney feels as he comes to the end of a failed teaching career and marriage: the subleties of sadness, anger, and ultimate emotional triumph. The film is basically about transcending one's despair with honesty to self and others. A great film all around."
1,The Browning Version,Swift service DVD arrived in tact. DVD not suitable for region and would not play. Company have refunded purchase price.So very good service but DVD notsuitable for watching in UK.
3,Where's the original Browning Version film?,"I am astounded first of all about the rave reviews of The Browing Version film starring Albert Finney produced in 1994 when the first and finest version (to use a pun) was released in 1951 starring Michael Redgrave.The 1994 release is a very poor remake compared to the original classic and if you think Finney's film is great, then you have much to look forward to see the other picture.Why oh why can't the Redgrave movie be converted to DVD? Anyone out there know if such a CD is available or being planned for release?"
3,"Serves as a starting point, but you'll need to buy more.","The Forgotten Realms boxed set is OK, though it only gives an overview of the realms, you would have to buy the City of Splendors, The Shining South, The Unaproachable East, Maztica, The Hordelands, and Oriental Adventures to make full use of it, it does give a relatively detailed description of Shadowdale and the dales so it is a good starting point. (If you have read any of the FR books it would be quite helpful in running a Campaign.)"
2,2nd Ed Forgotten Realms Boxed Set-Better left in the Box,"Just FYI: This review is for the 2nd Edition boxed set, not the D&D3; hardcover.There is much to the old axiom of 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 2nd Edition Forgotten Realms boxed set. Oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd Ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'Time of Troubles' trilogy of novels. It also adjusts the Dale Reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. It gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. It also brings out the worst of the Realms, like munchkin characters such as Drizzt Du'Urden and Elminster. Stick with the grey 1st Edition Boxed Set, it's a much superior version."
3,The most detaled game world ever.,"The problem, for me, with the Forgotten Realms line is exactly what my One-line above says, it is the most detailed fantasy game world. It is was vary hard for me to pick up this setting and pick a place to play in. With the large amount of material about this world it seemed to me to be hard to customize to your own likings. I eventually had to buy Spellbound to pick a spot I wanted to adventure in."
5,The man of the desert,"The Man of the Desert (Grace Livingston Hill #63)I loved reading this book, watching the two figure out that they were really meant for each other. The best part about her books to me, is she helps me understand bible verses better. When I read her books, I feel as though, I am in church listening to the preacher. This book helps you feel closer to the Lord. Grace livingston was truly the best author that I have ever read. Let me just tell you that you should consider buying this book."
5,2 great stories in one book,"The Man of the Desert: John Brownleigh had lived the lonely life of a missionary for 3 years, ministering to his flock of Indians in the desert. Although he longed for companionship, he knew it would take a special type of woman to live his chosen life with him. Hazel Radcliffe arrived in Arizona by private car on a passing train. She planned to stay for only one day, but circumstances threw her into deep trouble. Saved by Brownleigh, she felt an immediate attraction for the strong dedicated man.An Unwilling Guest: Evelyn Rutherford was appalled at the thought of spending a whole summer with an aunt in a small Ohio town. She preferred the excitement of New York, but her father refused to leave her alone in the city while he traveled. Then her aunt's sudden illness made it necessary fr her to become the unwilling guest of people she didn't even know. The Grey's were pleasant, but dull. Their religion seemed to be their whole life."
1,Parallel Bible - regular print,The print of this Bible is very small. The print is regular.Please do not advertise it as a large print.Besides that it is a wonderfull Bible.
2,Not for far sighted vision,I was very surprised after purchasing this Holy Bible to find that the print was so very small. I gave it away to someone who could read this tiny print.
5,Font size,"A quick response to the people who found the ""large"" print not large enough. Bibles are now offered in at least 4 font sizes; Regular, Large, Giant and Super Giant. I did not realize this myself until I browsed through the isles at my local Christian bookstore. I do not know if this version is offered in the giant or super giant but there is probably one offered somewhere. Amazon does have a feature where you can browse sample pages and I believe that the scans are actual size. Hope this is helpful."
3,Good for the price,"The Parallel Bible is a good learning tool in that it translates chapter for chapter, and verse for verse. However, the print is not really to be considered large. Also, it did not have look or feel of the Holy Bible which I sort of thought it would. Maybe I was expecting too much."
5,AMAZING!!!,I absolutely LOVE this Bible. Everything is understandable and I am so grateful. Brandy in customer service is also wonderful and she was a great help. I couldn't have dealt with a better company. I was wonderful ordering from you and I am really thankful!!!! :)
3,"Like the lay out, do not like the lack of Christ's words in Red","I really like this Bible. The layout is great. I like the fact that I can read both versions on the same page. This has helped me with my Bible study a lot. However, I am so disappointed that the words of Christ are NOT in red. It appauls me that words in red are not available for this type of Bible. Why in the world would that be omitted? That's almost like omitting Christ from out lives. What a horrible world this would be without Christ. Also, I wished the Bible had tabs. Add these two items to the Bible and this would be the perfect Bible."
3,Title is False Advertising - Print is NOT Large,"If you really need a Large Print book, don't buy this one. Before I bought this I saw a customer's review noting that the book received was not actually large print. I assumed there had been a shipping mistake. When I got my copy, I found she was right - the print is NOT large despite the claims on the book's cover and title page. In fact, the print is smaller than that of many other ""regular"" print Bibles. So my 3-stars rating reflects an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for falsely advertising ""Large Print"" when it's not."
4,Parallel Bible,"This Bible is wonderful! I had been planning on purchasing a parallel Bible for a while, but the cost had always been higher than I was willing to pay, given that I already have several single translation Bibles. This parallel Bible was a great price and had only the translations I was seeking (NIV and KJV), so I didn't feel IToday's Parallel Biblewas paying extra for translations I wouldn't use. The 'large print' was not quite as large as I was hoping, but it'll work."
1,Don't buy this book,"I LOVE Anne Rice and have read everything she has written. But this particular book is unreadable. Halfway through, I cried ""Uncle"" and put the book back on my shelf. This the FIRST time I have not read an entire book, and I'm extremely disappointed that it had to be a book by this particular author."
2,Not one of her best.,"If you are an Anne Rice lover, you may want to skip this one. It is written in classic Anne Rice style but focuses too much on the imagery and not enough on the story. I finished it only to say I did but thoughout the entire book was very disappointed."
1,Anne Rice has forgotten how to tell a story.,"There was a time when I looked forward to reading the next Anne Rice book. That time has come and gone with the arrival of Violin. What exactly was this book about? I want to sit down and read a good story, not the bloated prose of an author who has forgotten the reason we originally purchased her books."
1,So very slow and so very far away from Lestat!,"I have been a fan of Anne Rice's since day one. Unfortunately, her last two books have been a slow disappointment. Writing is an art form that imitates life, and Violin is like reading her biography. The character Triana is Anne Rice and she mourns the loss of her family and friends on the pages of this book. Every one mourns differently, but I am tired of reading about her dead family. This book has great descriptions of Louisiana and it's architectural history. The book starts out extremely slow, picks up and doesn't satisfy. Please, Anne Rice, bring back colorful characters like the ones in the Witching Hour and The Vampire Chronicles! Quit living in the past and move on!"
2,utterly depressing or a good sleep-pill ?,I have been a fan since I read a cry to heaven and the gothic sight of Anne Rice has always appealed to me. But this time Anne Rice takes the reader as hostage to exorcise her own demons. That would not be so bad if the two feelings that exsudes of the book were not sleepiness and depression. I am not a native speaker of english but her excessive use of the words utter or utterly every second or third page begins to get on my nerves.
1,I couldn't even force myself to finish this book!,"I have read every one of this authors books and was always a huge fan. The last few releases I tried not to read, did and was disappointed. After reading as much of Violin as I could take, I now know that I will not purchase another Anne Rice book. She seems to have lost whatever it was that she had that made her different from the others, now it seems she's writing just to write!"
1,a terrible piece of rubbish,"I have never been a huge fan of Anne Rice, only barely making it through the bloated and moronic psuedo-literature of the Vampire chronicles (which I simply had to stop reading after the fourth volume, which made me literally ill). However, while I was working the other day at the library I decided to speed read her new offering; boy am I sorry I did. It is Rice at her selfindulging worst, crafting the cheesy poetry style prose that for some reason has made her a big name. Let me ask other readers this question: with a story line this thin, how could the novel be 300 pages? Well, you probably know the answer. Rice makes a career out of expanding short story ideas into sprawling, nonsensical novels that reek of ego. This book could really have been a novella at best, yet in typical Rice fashion, throwaway scenes are abound. You could skip whole chapters of VIOLIN and still get the gist of it. Instead, why don't you do yourself a favor. Skip the entire thing."
2,River of pain...,"If a muse has a poison, it's name is contentment. Pain, if only recalled, is like watered wine. Pain must be present to be brought alive for others. Anne Rice is suffering from that common killer of talent; success. I believe she may sit awake at night and mourn the ease with which such masterpieces as ""Cry to Heaven"" and ""Feast of All Saints"" flowed from her psyche in a superb and matchless agony. Anne Rice may be a more fulfilled person now, happier, more secure, healing from a river of pain. Yet every gain comes with a loss. Too bad this loss is also our own. Anne, take some advice; stop writing for a while. Take a sabbatical. Get back in touch with whatever it was that made you a giant. In my mind, you still can be, which means you still are. H."
2,Just not enough of a story.,This is the first Anne Rice book I might have just as well not bothered with. She can still write but this was just not enough of a story line to justify a whole book. The ghost and the human characters seemed to be leftovers from some more complex plot.
1,Anne Rice at her worst,"If this book had been written by an unknown, it would never have seen print. Rice loses her command of both story and language before this drivel is through. I generally like her, so I was extremely disappointed. Save your money, and read the Vampire tales."
1,Skip it,"I don't know if you want to read my review or not, since I really haven't read the book all the way through. The truth is, I have problems even getting past the first few chapters. I have tried about 3 times now! This book rambles on like nothing I've ever read before. And I've read Stephen King! If you are the kind of person who likes a GOOD BOOK, not a book that gets good after 5 chapters or so, do NOT read this one. The few chapters I managed to choke down are nothing but meaningless drivel. It seems like Anne Rice is trying way to hard to make this book sound like some great classical novel. That's just the way it comes across. I've never read anything else by Ms. Rice, but I certainly hope her other books aren't as uninspired and boring as ""Violin."""
1,Erg.,"As a general rule, I'm addicted to the works of Anne Rice... with the exception of Violin. Her words are like paint on a canvas, but Violin is an inkblot.I allowed hours to be drawn into the plot. With the turn of each page I hoped I'd find some concept to grasp, but I didn't. This one didn't work for me, but I've read several others since that have validated my addiction to Anne Rice."
1,Disappointed!,I'm a big fan of vampire chronicles and the witching hour but this book is so disappointing. I don't think I could finish reading it. Where is the 'Anne Rice' who created Lestat ?????????
1,Where's the good stuff?,"I am a huge Anne Rice fan, I love the Vampire Chronicles, and The Witching Hour is my all-time favorite book. I was excited to read Rice's newest novel, Violin. The story began all right, and I could see where it was trying to go, it just never got there. I went through the book going, when's it going to get to the good stuff? Unfortunately, I had to finish the entire book to realize there wasn't any good stuff. It was alternately boring and confusing. There's real potential in both characters, but no real resolution between the two. Even for die-hard Rice fans like me, this book was terrible. It was so bad that I haven't read any of her new books after Violin and have gone back to reading her old novels, such as Belinda and The Mummy."
1,I couldn't wait to put it down...,"I have been a huge Anne Rice fan for years. Most often I really enjoy her use of history in her books, but this was just some type of lame attempt to - I don't know what. I had to force myself to finish the book and couldn't believe that I was saying to myself ""This book is just the worst."" While I enjoyed Cry to Heaven and Servant of the Bones, Rice is at her best when writing of Vampires, Witches, and The Talamasca."
2,"Too superficial Romanticism, Anne...","What happened to Anne Rice? This ""Violin"" doesn't explore the deepest meaning of Romanticism. It's too superficial and all the ideas drown in a slow, definetely boring writing. Either Anne didn't understand all the ideal implications of Romanticism or she perverted them. As for the music...Beethoven will curse her from his grave! She wasted a goldmine of possibilities using Beethoven, Paganini and Tchaikovski only to create atmosphere. Stefan? A weak character from every point of view. The best part was the beginning, Triana's mourning, but even that was too slow! ""Pandora"" was a little better than this book, ""Servant"" was useless and ""Memnoch"" partially ruined Lestat and her universe. Anne what's happening? I don't want Armand, my favourite character, to be destroyed!!!"
1,Avoid if you are prone to Migraines,What can you say when a favorite author writes a truly souring book...? Didn't even finish it..therefore I treated it as a ghost and it disappeared!
1,I can't believe I wasted my time with this,"I've been an Anne Rice fan for years, but I started having my doubts with The Witching Hour. The ending to that story was completely out of character, and it seemed to me it was just a hook to get you to read Lasher. I yelled at the book when it ended, I was so disgusted.But I've enjoyed some of her other work, so I've read on.Not anymore. This book was wretched. This is my last Anne Rice book ever. I'm giving my whole collection of her works away, to avoid having anyone see them on my shelf and think I might like one of her books as a gift."
1,A disappointing waste of time,"I've been a fan of Ms. Rice and her writing style for some time now, but this book was a big disappointment. Character development and plot were strangely absent. The book seemed to be just an incoherent rambling. The characters were boring, the story way too autobiographical (already read ""Prism of the Night"", thank you very much). Wish I'd given this one a miss."
2,Definitely not her best work.,"I am a very big fan of Anne Rice, and I love most of her books. However, I found this to be one of the most boring books she has written. I especially did not like the first few chapters and it just left me cold at the end."
2,Yuck,"Richly adorned language that is almost musical, yet the book put me to sleep after just a few minutes. Much too abstract."
1,disappointed,"i cannot believe this book comes from the same writer who's done interview with the vampire! when i saw this book in the bookshop and read the back,i though, oh! this sounds like a wonderful book! and the more i turn the pages the greater my disappointment.i liked the idea of the book but as a whole, it was just no good. i just got the feeling, if only she wrote it better..."
1,First and Last,This is the first book I have read by Anne Rice. It will be the last. I found the first chapter morbid and the rest of the book offered very little. NOT!
3,Violin is not a flop!,"I disagree with a lot of people who said it was not one of her finer novels, I disagree... I found it very creative, poetic, vivid scenes... I loved it... I do admit that there were a few boring parts in it, but alot of books have that... I think alot of people should give this novel a chance..."
4,Anne Rice does it again.,"I have read many of the other reviews on this site, and I am wondering which book the rest of you have read. I did not find this book dull or wooden, in fact I was engrossed from the beginning. If anyone finds this book to understand, it must be because it was approached in the wrong way. This is not the sort of book that can be entered into with preconceived notions. You must simply start it and let it take you where it wants. If you try to rationalize the events OR the characters, you have already missed the point. Just let the over-the-top deliciousness of the language take you on the ride of a lifetime. After all, it is only a book. Don't take it TOO seriously. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would read it again in an instant. This is going on my frequent-read-shelf."
3,A Symphony of Words...but unlike Rice's usually pieces!,"This was beautiful and erratic all at once. It was written with a foreward stating that it should have been a musical and not a book. This is so true. If you are someone who needs to have the plot presented to you...don't read this book. If you are someone who hates blurrs of reality and visions that are emotional and painful...don't read this book. If you are someone who can't confront death, and the painful abuse of life...don't read this book. BUT, if you enjoy being taken on a trip to an unknown destination, with emotional burdens, and the supernatural realm (in which only Rice can present,) then embrace this book with your soul as wholehearted as you can. And don't be afraid to feel for the characters or to weep for them. After all, symphonies usually do make the sensitive strike a tear."
1,"Love Anne Rice, Hate This Book","I have read every Anne Rice Book Published, And loved them all. But, This book stinks! I am bored, skipping pages, wondering when it will capture me. Did someone else write this book? It's like someone took all the fuffy stuff Anne sometimes writes and filled an entire book."
1,The first Anne Rice book you may not like.,"I usually devour her books but this one simply couldn't capture my attention. I spent the whole book from my first meeting with Treana and Stefan wondering where the story line was and I never found it. I found myself skipping pages just to try to get to the heart of the story and the ending just didn't sit well. Where have I heard ""go into the light"" before? But don't let this book turn you away from a very gifteded writer's works. Turn your attention to Pandora a book that is all but impossible to put down."
3,It all depends on what you expect,"Sad to say, I was expecting this book to be just as exciting and rich as the previous ones, and it wrecked my whole reading experience. But please do not compare this book to the previous ones. This may be a tale concerning the supernatural, but it concentrates more on the life of a woman who is alive and trying to get her life together. If you read it, do not expect it to be like the other novels!"
1,Makes great bathroom tissue!,"Oh my, what a horrible piece of trash this one is! Disjointed, rambling... either Ms. Rice was on illegal substances or perhaps it is just the onset of dementia. I would have rated it at best a half star but the scale wont let me. Let's just say that I'm glad I didnt pay full price for it when it first came out. It really isnt worth the paper it is printed on....but that's just my view. It isnt a total waste though. I use the pages to line my bird's cage."
3,A sonnet to the end of life,"I had tried to read this book when it came out and could not trudge through. But because of her other books I decided to borrow the taped version. Although nothing like the Vampire Chronicals or her bewitching Mayfair's which I love, it is written in the same grand manner and loving detail. I don't believe I could read it in the true sense of the word, I enjoyed and was enthralled with the characters as with her other more well known ones. If you are philosophical about death or intrigued with the topic of it I would recommend this book. Otherwise it's a bore."
1,Recyled ideas,"Anne Rice is one of my favorite authors, but her literary mechanisms are becoming to baroque and repetitive between books. The central plot recycles many of her more interesting twists from previous books: Memnoch the devil, the Mayfair witches, etc. I think Anne Rice needs to take a break and evaluate her plots more carefully.The focal person of the book, Triana, is an unappealing and unsympathetic character. She has few redeeming qualities, and consequently, I could not have cared less whether she lived or died. In the end I was hoping Stefan would suck Triana into hell. When compared to Lestat, the central characters of her Witch books, or charcters from other books such as Cry to Heaven, Triana is a pale shadow of what Anne Rice is capable of producing."
1,Anne's Worst,"This is her most awful book to date. It's uninteresting, and bores you to death. As a fan, I read it, but sheesh...I hope somebody had told me earlier not to. So to be considerate, I'm telling it now... DO NOT READ! (don't say I didn't warn you)"
2,"Confusing, hard to follow, definitely disappointing.","I'm a huge Anne Rice fan - read and enjoyed everything else, but Violin is a tough read. It's got hints of Rice, but I found the format so confusing and hard to follow that it was too hard to get into the story. I coudln't even finish it! I got 2/3 into it and just couldn't endure anymore. I just bought Pandora, I'm a bit tentative, but I have to give Anne the benefit of the doubt."
2,I usually like Rice!!,"Enjoyed the character Triana, Rice spent too much time on Stephan. I was lost and spent more time trying to understand and deciper Chapter 13. I love her novels, as you can tell by me email address, but this one....well, just bought Pandora today. Hope that doesn't disappoint. Sorry Anne. No hard feelings, your the novelest not I.Tish"
1,I was bored and disappointed.,"I read two vampire books by Anne Rice last year and became her fan. When Violin came out I wanted to read it badly. I checked the online reviews but found that many people didn't like this book. Because I always have a strong feeling about music, I thought maybe I could have a better understanding of this book. I borrowed the book-on-tape and listened for 12 hours. It was very boring. Many times my mind just wondered off since there wasn't much to miss. I don't like any of the characters. I have no compassion for them. I cannot feel their pain. The only moment I feel a little upset was when the instruments were on fire, but the description is flat. I'm very disappointed. I don't recommend this book to anyone, especially those music lovers. That's all I have to say about this book."
1,run don't read,"Run, do not read! Do not buy. Do not accept if given as a gift. I've read all books by Ann Rice and I can't believe she REALLY wrote this one."
2,"If you've enjoyed other Rice books, this one is not for you!","The book was so dry, fragmented and slow! I am an avid Anne Rice reader, and I can't believe that she actually wrote this book! The character developement was sketchy, and some parts seemed out of place. Do not bother to waste your time to read this book!"
2,Anne Rice: Please come back!,"I have beeen an Anne Rice fan forever. I really love her work,but not this one. Too slow, only the part were Stephan shows Triana his past is worth reading . PLEASE Ms.Rice COME BACK!.Tell us more about the Talamasca ,The Mayfairs ,the Vampires,Ramses or even Azriel . Dr,L. Rivera, San German PR"
5,"Very Different, Yet Good","Violin is different than any of Anne Rice's books. From reading the different reviews, I am astounded at the lack of acceptance of something different by Rice. It did take some time to understand the point of the story, but as soon as you reach chapter 5 or 6, it takes off. I was not aware of any of Rice's life, so maybe some of her other readers should learn to read a book for the story, not because of any biographical input you may think is present. The main point is that Violin is different than the Vampire Chronicles or those of the Mayfair Witches. If readers could get past the supposed life story of the author contained in the book, they would see that the content is excellent. Read the book for the story, not to analyze it. (That's pathetic.)"
5,A look into the public facade,"For years Anne Rice's fans have known of the tragedy in her life and now, through ""fiction"" she opens herself up and lets us know what it was like. I walked away from Violin with a better sense of who Anne is and what demons she feverishly tries to dispel with her writing. Although not her best, it is one that I will reread. I recommend it for those Riceans who are so wrapped up in the vampires that they have lost sight of Anne's talents."
5,"Seriously, this is a good book!!","Wow, I am one of a few here who really liked this book by Rice. I found that it had depth-- you could almost taste the main characters greif in this story and also the passion that the ghost in the story has for the violin and music. I did not have a problem maintaining interest in this book from start to finish. It may be my second favorite Rice book. :)"
4,Distressing!,"This was the first Anne Rice book I've read, but I'll read them all! It puzzled me as a novel but I strongly recommed my friends to read it."
1,Last Anne Rice I will ever read,"Here is my theory on Anne Rice books. If you were to read every other chapter of the book, you would still get the same experience. Anne is too wordy and she says things in 300-400 pages that could be said in 200 pages. Anne, you bore me."
1,"As with some of her last books, I am deeply disappointed","I read all readers reviews before buying it. Thought criticism could not be fair, as I loved all her witches and vampires. Had to force myself to finish it, and usually used it to get deeply asleep at night. If you are still a Rice fun, don't buy it, at least borrow it from someone as unlucky as myself."
2,Anne Rice has beaten immortality to death once again....,"I awaited the release of Violin with great anticipation. I was disappointed with Anne Rice's self-imposed limitations. Anne Rice has beaten immortality to death. Please, Mrs. Rice, take us into a new world of magical creatures and leave immortality as a plot tool, not the whole plot."
3,Too morbid for my tastes.,"""Violin"" was too morbid for me. I am sorry that Anne Rice had such a bad childhood and lost her first child at an early age. But I don't like to wallow in someone else's misery. I liked her other books to excape into a fantasy world. ""Violin"" had too much of the misery in the real world. Once she started traveling with the ghost to the past it got interesting but that was half-way through the book. I almost did not finish it. I would not buy anymore of her books that were similar to ""Violin""."
2,A perscription for the insomniac,"I was very disappointed in this book. With all the publicity it received I exexpected a better novel. It literally put me to sleep. The author must have had ""writer's block"" as she wrote this book. I know she can produce a better piece of work because I've read her other novels."
1,Maybe she can claim she was drinking?,"This is a convoluted tale of two different stories pasted onto one another for no other reason than the author could. After LESTAT and INTERVIEW, this novel was a huge disappointment.Even most of the diehard Anne Rice fans sighed about this one. This book is one that can and should be missed. If you love Anne Rice books, just say no because this one could ruin your taste for her. As for Ms. Rice, better luck next time."
1,Did anyone actually finish this one???,"I was shocked and dismayed. The endless drivel of unimportant details never congeals, much less culminates! Sorry to say, I had to put this book away after about two thirds complete. Too bad, Anne might have done the same and saved us all some time. Her usual loving, lavish attention to detail takes on a laborious note with this read. There never seemed to be much of a point, nothing to grip the reader. The plot weakened to the point where I had to put this away, lest I be jaded for more of her work to come. Just my opinion, and I haven't yet made it to the end (after almost two years!). I look forward to more of Anne Rice, her style I have found to be exquisite in detail, her characters to be deep, complex, and engaging. Unfortunately this novel lacks much of what I have enjoyed to date of her writing."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't wait to read this book when it came out. Now I wish I had. Anne Rice's characters are unbelievable. She jumps around from one character thought and dream to another with no apparent connecting thread at times. The only good thing about this book was the end, for then I knew I didn't have to read another jumbled paragraph."
2,Disappointing,"As an avid Anne Rice fan, I had to force myself to continue reading the book. I found myself skimming many pages in order to reach the end and end my own misery."
2,Could have done better.,"This book displayed Rice's usual vivid descriptions, but lacked the good plotline that she had in previous writings. I was very disappointed in this particular book."
1,Pitiful.Sad.,"I do not think that there was one single solitary redeemable character in this book except for the people the main characters constantly whined over who were already dead. Certainly these two were hardly worthy of life, much less to be put down on paper. This book stunk!!"
1,I'm very disappointed with this effort by Anne Rice,"First of all, let me start by saying that I am an Anne Rice fan. I loved her Vampire Lestat series, Sleeping Beauty series, and the Mayfair Witches series, as well as her other writings. Having said that I must say that I am very disappointed with Violin. I found the tale depressing, and the character of Triana impossible to identify with. If this had been the first Anne Rice novel I had picked up, I don't know if I would have explored further. She has done an excellent job in the past. I hope she will continue to write novels along the lines of her past successes, and not continue on a downward spiral inspired by Violin."
1,Rice indulges self; readers pay the price,"I was not at all surprised to read in the above review that this is an emotionally autobiographical book; it had all the hallmarks of an excersize in authorial self-indulgence. I'm a writer myself and no slouch when it comes to reading ""hard"" books, but I can't stand the tricksy, overbearing attitude of the first few chapters (all I could bring myself to read.) It was as though Rice was thinking that every random sensory impression that came into her head was of compelling interest. I suspect that Rice has become a victim of her own success; if you want to see a more fair representation of what she is capable of, read _Interview With the Vampire_ instead."
1,Put Me To Sleep !,"Four Words Describes This Book The Best ,[Put Me To Sleep] !! The Story Starts Off With Triana Becker As A Looney Tune Mad Woman Whose Deep In Grief Over The Death Of Her Husband From Aids . And The Death Of Her Daughter Years Ago From Cancer . The Book Kinda Gets Going A Little When Stefan The Ghost Arrives. His Life Story Is Really Intresting And Is The Only Thing Worth Reading About In This Very Poorly Written Book . I Think Anne Most Have Been On Another Planet When She Wrote This ! I Loved All The Vampire Chronicles But This Here Is By Far The Worst Thing Ever Published . Anne Your Better Than This !!!"
5,I Luv the book !!!,"It was hard for me to put the book down, I couldnt wait to find out what was going to happen next."
1,worst book I ever read,I kept reading this book hoping it would get better but it never did. I can't believe how bad this book is. How could Anne Rice get away with publishing this book.
2,I find Anne Rice's writing style appalling..,"I've never been able to finish her books because I get headaches from them. I think she is one of the most overrated modern writers. However, I managed to slug my way through Violin and even finished reading it. I found the idea and plot to be solid but Anne's writing style abhorrent, as usual. Of all Anne's books I think I would most like to see this one made into a movie only because I liked it's gothic romance premise. I think it would make a better movie than it was a book. Scottish actor, Tony Curran should play the role of Stefan."
1,One Star is TOO much,"I gave this book one star because zero wasn't available.Anne Rice has always been marvelous at drawing mental pictures for me as I read her books. This one drew mental blanks.Actually, the story line is very good. The ghost, the history, the intertwining stories of the Russian prince and the New Orleans Socialite were intriguing. But the excess of words! Rice's flowery writing has always caused her stories to soar. In this one, the prose was a boat anchor. For a while, I reread every paragraph trying to figure out what she had said, but finally gave up. I had to force myself to finish it."
2,They just keep getting worse,I loved the first 5 vampire chronicles. _Cry to Heaven_ is probably my 2nd favorite book ever from anyone in any genre. Then there was _Pandora_ - not bad but not great. Then _Vittorio_ - was this a short story? and then _Merrick_ - wake me up when it's over or when Lestat says a couple words. Now _Violin_ - the story starts about 200 pages in and ends about 50 pages later. This books seemed more like writing practice for Mrs. Rice. Her writing is so beautiful but NOTHING happens.Next...
3,Beatiful but lacking,"I found Violin to be a beatiful novel, though if I did not read it with aide of an audio book I would not have been able to complete it. The story was powerful, and sucked me in.The beginning was painfully emotional and disturbing (disturbed is all that I can feel when reading about a woman who stays in her house with her dead husband for days until she and he are discovered.) I would not recommend this book for those who must have a fast action sequence, nor to those who find emotion sappy and boring. This book is frequently criticized for it's suspected autobiographical qualities, but what book is not autobiographical of it's author in some form? I'm sorry if the thought of an author with a story about one's self worth telling disturbs you, and truly suggest you culture yourself more."
1,I'm still trying to read it!,"Oh my God! I never read a book more boring than this one, I'm a avid reader also a fast one... I could read a 600 pages novel in 2 days... but I have more than a month trying to read the Violin, but always I got slept.. I'm a very good fan of Anne's writtings, but this time I feel betrayed... This story seems endless, too many details, never read anything so boring...So sorry, but it's the really, unpleasant true..."
1,What a MESS!,"It's like Anne dropped acid and decided to write a book. The main character, Triana, must be a materialization of Anne herself, and the conflicts she's had with her past. She exhibits grief over her daughter, jealousy of her husband, and hatred/love of her parents and their abusive habits. This book is one long crying jag, and the characters NEVER stop whining. I kept falling asleep, and only finished the book, because I kept hoping it would improve. It doesn't. Pure senseless drivel- A total waste of time and money."
1,Dissonance,"I've read much of Rice, and enjoyed quite a bit of it, but this book astonished me in how incredibly atrocious it was. The style was purple enough to induce vomiting, tremors, and tears. I ended up throwing the novel away, and I've never done that before, but I felt I had to protect myself and others. This low quality isn't typical of her work, and is probably the result of some degenerative brain disease."
2,I just didn't enjoy the book.,I was expecting more from Anne Rice book and I didn't get it from this book. I found it boring.
2,Hmm...,"I received this book as a gift when the mass market paperback first came out since my aunt knew I liked Anne Rice. I was rather excited, and the start is good. However, the book quickly became plodding. There's a wholoe bunch of characters which really add nothing to the story or plot. Ms. Rice wrote some beautiful sentences and paragraphs and this book did have some good parts. I found the story of the Violin (the instrument in the book) and its origins to be interesting and the best part of the book. However, this book fell flat overall. The premise was interesting enough, but this book simply was not as good as her earlier works.If you're a die-hard Anne Rice fan/completist, you will want to read this book, but otherwise, it's simply not worth your time if you're looking for something worthwhile and enjoyable to read. Without Ms. Rice's name, this book just wouldn't stand on its own."
2,Drivel!,"I am still in the process of reading this one...what's happened to Anne Rice? Anyone? She used to be so interesting..now just laborious reading!! I loved the vampire series, the witches were o.k...but this, this is not worth your time!!!!!"
2,It was disappointing for the most part.,"I did finish VIOLIN, but only out of respect for Anne Rice. As a classical musician myself, I expected to be totally drawn into the story, I was not. I didn't dislike Triana and I was fascinated with her childhood and virtually anything else about New Orleans. However, I couldn't really warm up to her. I don't have a problem with Rice's straying from her gravy train of Vampires and Witches, in fact, my favorites are FEAST OF ALL SAINTS and CRY TO HEAVEN. It just seems there was not much point to VIOLIN and it moved at a snail's pace. Also, unfortunately, the heroine was not beautiful or, from what I could understand, in any real danger. I respect the amount of research Rice does on all her novels and I still enjoy her writing style, but this won't be a book I read again."
1,"slow, repetitive and boring",This was the first Anne Rice book I've read and I had to force myself to finish it. I kept waiting to get to the part where the story starts to move and it never happened.
1,Her move from concrete to abstract is a disaster.,"I have read all of her books and loved every one until Violin. Perhaps because I am a violinist, I sense that she is right out of her depth here and really did not have anything to say to me. I was extremely disappointed and I wish she would write more of her fabulous earlier style of novel. I think that a violinist cannot be duplicated by a novelist however talented. Too many years of solitary practice can make a non-musician really easy to spot as a trespasser. The central core of the book is fog."
3,Confusion reigns,"I didn't care for this book by Anne Rice, though I have read and enjoyed most of the other books she's written. But for all that I wasn't enjoying Violin while reading, it was impossible to escape the mood it created. I was still thinking about the book days later, so strong were the sensory impressions it envoked. While not the most interesting action-wise of Rice's books, Violin was incredibly rich in emotion and drawing that same emotion out from this reader."
2,Every fine author lays an egg now and then,"We have seen it a million times: no matter how good you are, no matter how excellent your editors are, no matter what talent you have; every now and then a fine author turns out a loser. Violin is.Too bad. Anne Rice is excellent and her previous books have been image-filled, lush, unique and had that keep-'em-up-at-night quality. Violin, on the other hand, plays much like a concert you didn't particularly want to go to on a Friday night after a hard week. It puts you to sleep."
2,One word-disappointing,"I'm only forty pages into this book and I'm already having trouble. I feel as if though I should finish it and get my money's worth but that could be asking alot. Even if I do try and finish it I may not be getting my money's worth. Watching Rosie O'Donnell on Friday I was excited to see that Anne Rice was going to appear. One statement she made was that not one bit of her manuscript is edited before going to print. That's pretty unusual, even for a big time writer. This book is selling due to the name on the front cover not for the quality of the writing. I hope her next book is an improvement or I'm giving up on her."
2,The Sad Disintegration of Talent,"Her early books were great...original, luminous page-turners. Then Anne Rice became a ""famous author."" Apparently, she's now so famous that editors are afraid to alter her undisciplined, self-indulgent prose. What a shame. Encouraged to hope by the memory of Interview with the Vampire, Cry to Heaven and other early works, I keep buying and reading Rice's stuff...but this repetitive stew of self-pity (the main character is billed as a vastly intelligent woman, yet ruminates on and on and on over the same handful of incidents in her so tragic life like a lobotomized Guernsey) may be the final straw! What we have here is interior monologue substituting for plot. When this novel finally drags to an end, Rice swiftly and inexplicably ties up a few loose ends in a most unsatisfying way, but at least we're rid of the incessant weepers and whiners who populate this time-waster."
2,hard read,"I gobble up everything Anne Rice writes. This book was soooo hard to read. I was bored. I knew that I was not getting into a vampire blood fest, but I at least expected something interesting. This book fell short of even being something I wanted to pick up. I force feed myself this book hoping that it would get better somewhere but it never did."
3,it was ehh...,"I haven't read much of Anne Rice's other works, but this one neither impressed nor depressed me. The musical message appealed to me, but the beginning was slow. Keep reading and it will get better."
1,WHY CAN'T I GIVE IT A NEGATIVE STAR RATING??????,"YIKES!!!!! What da $)#&%^@. If ever there was a book I would burn this is it. It was horrible. I kick myself when I pass it on the shelf here. I kept telling myself "" one more page it will get better Anne would never make a POS"" Geez it was boring, totally unedited, hard to follow, and stupid! The fact that it is semi-autobiographical scares me. It scares me because there are WAY to many ways to have exorcised those demons in words. This was the worst possible arrangement. I honestly would like someone that like this novel to walk me through it and make me see their point of view. I promise to be open-minded. Cuz I just don't get it."
1,"And it sits, half read, on my shelf..","I am normally a fan of Anne Rice, and was excited when this book came out, but as soon as I sat down and started reading it, I was greatly disappointed. I tried to force myself to get through it, telling myself that ""something interesting has to happen soon""; it never did. Finally, I had to set it aside, and now it sits on my shelf, waiting until I have someone to give it to as a gift, someone with more patience for weak characters and dragging, pointless description, than myself."
3,I think I need to read it again,"I have read Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Servant of the Bone and loved them so I decided to try her newest title, Violin. I had a really hard time getting through it and haven't finished it yet. It seems like it would be an interesting story but it doesn't move very fast ata all. Getting through it will take a lot of patience."
1,Run away!,I can't believe this book made it to print. I love Anne Rice. Her gift is incredible but this book did not show it. Reading this book was kin to riding along on someone elses acid trip. It rambled on. At one point I wanted to fling the book out my window into the rain. If you have never read Anne Rice and want to pick up one of her books.....Don't choose this one.
1,Lacks signature spellbinding character development,"Simply put, Violin lacks the beautiful character development of Anne Rice's better novels. I felt no emotional connection to her characters, which made this book a difficult read.If you've read the Witching Hour, you'll be sorely disappointed with Violin."
2,Swimming through 100 Pages,I love Anne Rice just as much as the next person but this book just didn't do it for me. I have noticed that a few of her books have slow intros but this one....I had to read over 100 pages of a 300 page book to get into it. It just wouldn't take off. If you like books that captivate you from the first page this is not the book for you. I would recoment trying one of her Vampire books. Although this novel was rich with music history it lacked the necessary captivating intro to keep the reader interested in what many may consider a dry topic. Hope you enjoy reading this novel more than I did or that you enjoy her other marvelous books.
2,"In Defense of ""avid"" Rice Fans...","I would like to address the reviews of those who cannot understand why this book left so many Rice fans cold. I have read everything Rice has written, under all her pen names. Some of her best work, in my opinion has nothing to do with ghosts, witches, or vampires. She has a rare gift with the historical novel, ""Cry to Heaven"" and ""The Feast of All Saints"" are both cases in point. However, ""Violin"" (which does focus around a ghost) failed to inspire me because I could not develop empathy for her main character, nor the ghost that haunts her. The mere facts of Triana's life do not in themselves inspire warmth towards her character. If I had read nothing else Rice has written, perhaps I would have enjoyed ""Violin"" for itself. But one of Rice's great talents is character development, and in this instance, I felt she failed."
1,NO NO NO,"I am a huge vampire chronicles fan and love them all. therefore I thought this book would be good as well. While it does start off interesting, it goes downhill quickly. I kept thinking that it would get better, but it never did. Very disappointing. Boring boring boring."
2,"Interesting plot, bland book","Anne Rice is a usually a great author. I very much enjoy her Vampire Chronicals books and overall I think they're well written. Violin however was one of the most bland, uninteresting, uncaptivating books I've read in years. It would have been very morbid and depressing had I any interest in the characters or the situation, but there was no chance of that with this novel and it's writing style (or lack thereof). This was a major dissapointment which I struggled to finish. I would not recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys classic Anne Rice. However, if you're looking for a Rice novel that gets away from her Vampire and Witch storylines, try Servant of the Bones."
2,Lacking inspiration,"Try as I might, this book could not hold my interest. There was so much information of thoughts about everything, I kept wanting the characters to actually DO something! I have been immensely pleased with all of her other books and I love how Anne Rice keeps the reader entranced with the history and plot lines. Perhaps I missed something or it was an off time for me, but I just could not find anything to keep me interested in this one."
3,Violin - it wasn't GREAT,"The book was okay. Not horrible. Took a long while to read, unlike others which were easy to progress through. Pandora was worse than this."
2,Very slow,"I found this book to be very slow and depressing. Nothing like her other books, which I loved. This book has taken me forever to get through. I ended up falling asleep."
1,The Downward Spiral,"Anne Rice's gift of writing appears to be fading. After enjoying the Vampire Chronicles I was saddened that I couldn't even make it past the first 100 pages of Violin. It's a goofy, boring, wordy, pile of --. I keep expecting to find Fabio painted on the cover of her books. 'Memnoch' was pretentious and 'Servant' was passable but I'm starting to lose faith. Maybe she'll redeem herself with my favorite supporting character, Armand."
1,Skip this book--it is far from her best,"I had to force myself to complete this book which I did only because I was convinced that it would get better. Anne Rice's main character, Triana, is obsessed with death and dying. It is overkill-no pun intended. I have read other Anne Rice books and recommend that you skip Violin and check out one of her other novels. I would hate for a new reader to be turned off by Anne Rice's writing because this was the first book of her's they have picked up. I suggest The Witching Hour by Anne Rice instead or one of the books from the vampire series."
1,Why was this book published?,"I am an Anne Rice hardcover collector & thus had to have this book when it came out. But to tell you the truth, I haven't even finished it because it's so bloody boring! Memnoch was bad with a capital ""B"", but this one is POINTLESS! Why Anne, why?"
1,A Disappointing Read,"While I am a big fan of all of Anne Rice's other books, I was very disappointed in Violin. I just could not develop an interest in any of the characters. I didn't give a hoot what happened to any of them. The story seemed limp and it struck me that Anne had no idea of where she wanted to go with the story. It is very rare for me not to finish a book once I have started it, but I gave up on this one about 3/4 into it."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK!!!,The only Anne Rice novel I have read and I absolutely loved it. It is a magical novel. Anne Rice also fulfills the reader with history and classical music. I thought it was a beautiful book. After this book I tried reading other novels of hers and couldn't get into it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
4,A Window into Anne Rice's Soul,"Throw out every expectation you have about Anne Rice. This book is different. Although some people think ""different"" is a bad thing, in Violin, it isn't.Unlike her last couple of books, Anne Rice returns with the prose-poetic feeling of Interview of a Vampire and, as an added bonus, she reveals herself in an intriguing story about a brat-Virtuoso and a lost woman who finds herself in the New Orleans, in Vienna of the past, and in the jungles of Rio de Janiero.Weaving classical music within the threads of her tale, she shows no mercy for this ghostly violinist. Unlike her self-aware, supernatural beings of other tales, Stefan (the violinist) is lost and petty. Instead, it is the heroine, the earth-bound human, who is empowered."
3,Slow In Its Development But Imaginative,"It was nice that Anne Rice uncharacteristically wrapped up this story in a single volume. Also in light of what we've since come to know of her life at the time this was written, this was obviously a personal story for her to tell. The opening chapter in which the female protagonist lies in bed beside her dead husband's body, unwilling to give him up, is the sort of material that adheres to memory. Odd how this novel seems anachronistic today in light of Rice's current subject matter and what she has vowed she will spend the rest of her life writing. To be blunt I doubt she could have gotten this story published had she not been able to trade on her brand name status, but that's true of much of what exists on the market today. I did find this tale of loss, healing, and the haunting nature of love to be better than most of what is out there in this author's canon. Or at least among what she's written in the last twenty years."
5,A tale of great humanity and love.,"This book was recommended to me by a person whose views of literature I respect greatly. He gave me a great gift in introducing me to this powerful little book. I literally could not put it down. I was raised Irish and have visited Ireland many times. This story captures the beauty, tragedy, and intensity, as well as the sometimes breathtaking acceptance of love and pain which marks so many of the Irish. I will read this again and again."
5,Beautiful book for a rainy afternoon!,"This is a treasure book...not to be loved by all, but by a few who love humanity. The tender mercies clearly detailed in this book will strike the souls of those who know they could falter along life's road. It is lyrical and simple...beautifully told. I read it several years ago and forgot the title. Tonight I ran into a friend in a bookstore who was looking for it and was delighted to have, at last, found the title again. This is a book to keep and return to when you are sure your sins will never be forgiven, and to learn,at the end of the day,that they will."
2,Like an artichoke there's not much there,"At 149 pages, with wide margins and large type, this is hardly more than a long short story. The current selling price of $4.80 is as much as it is worth. I wouldn't pay a penny more than that.It is not a bad story, a sort of homey Irish tale that meanders along, although I could have done without the lengthy description of the salmon fishing at the end. If that was supposed to be some kind of allegory,I didn't get it. If it had been part of a larger work about the priest or about the town I might have even liked it somewhat but standing alone it required an investment of time and effort (albeit short) that I didn't feel paid off.I would advise others to be wary of being swayed by the praise of other reviews. This book may be to some people's taste but I would think not many."
1,LYRICALLY BORING,"The blurb writers and reviewers of this book must have been compensated because never have I been so disappointed in the advance word regarding a novel. Yes, the writing is poetic, but the story is aimless and the characters not defined. In quantity and quality this is a very thin book."
4,A wonderful evenings read,"Picked this slim elegant story up at our library book sale. It was a lovely tale of a time and place that surely does not exist anymore. The book wholly transports you to a small coastal village in Ireland. It is mainly about 2 characters and a tale that has you turning pages in anticipation. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I found no disappointment in the ending. It is a quiet tale, subtle and one that stays with you for it's timid reveal."
2,"Best accompanied by strong, hot tea","I'm not sure this novella will stick with me; the story, while well-told, is tied tightly to a time and place that no longer exist. I couldn't find the parallels to life as it is lived today; very little in the story felt universal. Still, it would be a nice, short read on a rainy day with a cup or two of hot tea. But make it strong tea or you might find yourself asleep."
5,I'll give this book as a gift.,"This book conveys in its few pages a feeling of Ireland at a certain place in time. In addition, it introduces the fly fishing ""culture"" that is still an important part of the country. But most importantly, it portrays an intriguing moral predicament. This is alot for such a small book to achieve . My husband and sons loved it too."
2,Did I miss something???,"Okay, the writing WAS exquisite, but it doesn't make up for the lack of plot. The concept was intriguing and the language authentic, but what the heck was the resolution?? So the priest catches a big fish at the end... Was this an allegory that indicated he had a relationship with Enda? I love a book with a message, but this one's was just too vague for me."
4,a moving story,"This was a very affecting book, written in a way that made it hard to put it down. It is a simple story told in a straightforward way, though there are a couple of ambiguous points that the reader has to fill in. Or I could say, that keep the reader wondering.The book is subtle, and I'm not, so it's hard to describe how good this book is, except to say there is an underlying complexity and restraint in the relationship among the characters that makes me care about them very much. I wish the story would continue to reveal what happens next, but that would erase the ambiguity and mystery, so I know it will never happen."
2,Snooze,"Uggh. This book was trumped up by a distributor from Harper Collins that talked at my publishing group. He said it had been in print forever and was loved by many and bookstores were still buying it.Ehh. Nicely writter, but the ""secret"" at the heart of the book wasn't a big deal so what's with all the hemming and hawing. It just wasn't all that."
3,CD HAS 2 GREAT SONGS FROM THE LATE 80s,"If you think, like I do, that some of the greatest american songs come from the period 1987-1992, this is an album you must have. The songs WHEN I SEE YOU SMILE and PRICE OF LOVE are really wonderful. I live in Spain and those songs bring me great memories from the years when the show AMERICAN TOP 40 was heard in Spain, and those songs were very popular here. Thanks for giving me the chance to write here."
1,HELP,"Good day! As of this writing, i still haven't received the product i'd purchased! What should i do? At the ""track package"", my stock cannot be traced! Help!"
5,Looks great but not a pair,I wanted to replace my black PIAA covers with chrome and was misled by the picture above showing 2 covers. I placed an order but received only one. If I spent a couple of seconds to read the whole product description I probably would have figured it out. I just ordered the second but might have thought twice if I originally knew it was going to be $50 for the pair. Still happy though. They look great.
2,packaging problems,"the flippers have this really convenient release and fit toggle. The snork is o.k., but the mask was bent by the packaging and rendered useless."
3,Not a hit,"Gee, this seemed like it would be a hit with my 6 mo old. Easy to grip, fabric to chew on. But my son doesn't really like it. Not sure why. The flower heads move around, which can be frustrating I guess when you are trying to get them into your mouth. But even though he is more coordinated now, it only lasts a few seconds before it gets tossed aside. Maybe he'll like it more when he is older. Hmmmm....."
1,Piece of Junk,"Avoid this product like the plague. It is so horribly designed that it makes me wonder if they actually did product and usability testing. Ok, ok so here's why: 1. the wire from the phone to the device is too short, causing you to have to keep the plastic device near the phone at all times, 2. the retractable wire is TOO SHORT, it needs to be at least 12"" longer, 3. the plastic case has a 'hang up' button that constantly rubs up against things and drops my calls (!). If those aren't reason enough consider that the earpiece falls out constantly becuase the mic either gets caught on things or swings the device out of your ear. What a waste of money."
5,Perfect for my application,"Because of past dealings with Remo, I am pretty loyal to them. No, I am not endorsed by Remo, but their customer service is, in a word, fantastic. I use Remo on my entire kit, and have been using a coated CS on my 12"" Stavent custom snare, which is a ""stave"" type drum made of walnut and bubinga. The CS head rang a little too much for my taste, so I decided to try the Evans HD Dry. I'm glad I did! I get the nice tight pop that our music requires without excessive ring. I was able to attain a nice high pitch without having to tighten the head excessively, and it is quite loud, more so than than the Coated CS (I don't need to mic it...Yay!). After the first gig, and thousands of hits, there is not a mark on the Evans head. I have to say that the Genera HD Dry is now my go-to head for the snares I own! Perfect!"
5,swiss army knife,"The best of this line-light enough for back-packing, versatile enough for most uses. Now if only I didn't lose them so often!"
4,"Simple, Solid","Let's cut to the chase; you want a basic toolset that'll fit in your pocket and won't break. This is it. It's sturdy but short and thin enough to fit in your pocket and has the most common handy tools (minus the Phillips head! The description says it has a Phillips head screwdriver but it does not!).If you're not super serious about being a handy man but just want something that can remove splinters, cut loose threads, open boxes, etc., this is it."
5,Has my husband's approval,"My husband specifically requested this item as a gift, so I bought it for him. He loves it and uses it all the time. It's very handy when you need to cut something quickly and don't have access to scissors!"
5,Good Handy Swiss Army Knife,I bought this for my friend and she LOVED it. She immediately started using the scissors on this. Very good handy present.
5,"Nice knife, sharp and multiple functions",The knife is easy to carry and easy to use.The material of those tools is quite strong which makes them quite solid and sharp.This knife now is my small backup toolbox.
5,its swiss army,its a swiss army product....that says it all! only thing to decide is how complex you want it - amazon has more than a dozen swiss army knives with different attachments. the best part is the price on amazon...it is 1/4 of regular store price for this product.
3,"OK, but flimsy","This is a well priced set of plate holders, but look out -- this is lightweight. It's fine if you are using the holders secured to a wall where nobody will touch them -- it's too flimsy if you plan to attach them to anything that moves, or might be bumped against."
5,"As external card readers go, this one is pretty simple!","The card reader is easy to use and installed without a problem. If you're looking for a solid external card reader, this is a good choice."
1,the XP drivers dont work,the instructions say the installer will have an msi file. It is not there! So driver will not install on XP. truly a useless product
3,Worth it even for just one song,"Still sinking my teeth into this record, but it's worth it just for All You Do Is Talk, which sounds like U2 being assaulted by The Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine. Brilliant.BRMC still haven't topped their first album, but they are a band that I always go back to. Gorgeous melodies, moody atmosphere (a little Daniel Lanois in there) and refreshing arrangements. I still think their best album is in them, somewhere. Let's hope they don't disintegrate before they discover it."
4,Not bad!,"As someone wrote before this remonds one of some heavier Beatles stuff. Indeed, the melodic elements are quite more deleoped than on earlier efforts and while it may be somewhat less rocking or noisy than porevious efforts, it actually has better melodies and does stand up better to repeated listenings."
2,Dissapointing,"B.R.M.C. began with 2 very good albums, and I thought that their 3rd, Howl, was an extremely good record that showed great range, emotion, and maturity. was hoping that their next release would continue the evolution. Sadly, for me, Baby 81 feels like a de-evolution, and it has very few moments that make me perk up and take note. ""windows"" and ""weapon of choice"" are decent tracks, and I also like ""All You Do Is Talk"" but overall I found very little to appreciate, and there is nothing so compelling as the title track to Howl or ""Gospel Song"" or ""Promise"". It lacks depth and often feels like a forced offering, almost as if they are simply trying to reclaim a demographic. It's frustrating, because after Howl they seemed like they could be on the verge of a masterpiece."
2,Same ol',Sounds a lot like a rehash of the last CD. There's a distinct possibility that the album cover is better than the album itself.
4,Bound to be misunderstood,"I'm seeing a lot of reviews that demonstrate how misunderstood this record is, already. There's a lot of talk of BRMC taking a step ""backward"" or retreating, or reverting. Certainly, the sound is more akin to the rest of their catalog than it is to Howl, but I don't see it as anything other than their next record. The recording sessions were fairly close to those for Howl, and several of the songs were written, and performed live at least contemporary to that record. Plus, during Howl, they were down one man. So, it seems to me that if you are a fan of what BRMC are about, this will be a welcome addition, but if you're not, and really want them to be something they aren't, you'll misunderstand.What BRMC are is pretty simple: a rock and roll band. This is a rock and roll record."
3,Three Blind Mice,"If you enjoy police dramas/thrillers this one is worth at least a rental. A hacker enjoys watching girls webcams and witnesses a murder. He calls the police but becomes a suspect himself because of his online activities. When he assists a female detective to investigate it becomes obvious someone is watching their every move, and more people die. Whose behind the snuff movie murders? Who can they trust with what they have found out? The police? The government? The ending could have been more satisfying, but this is by far not the only one that left things in the air. If you enjoyed this catchHackers.CA Luster"
3,3 blind mice,"Three Blind Miceits a little cheesy, but it actually turned out to be a pretty decent movie."
3,Movie Seems Diffrent...,"The actors in this movie did a great job; whatmade this movie lose potential was the ending(Which I will not reveal).Here's how the storyline goes.A young adult named Thomas visits a Web Cam Siteand falls in love with a nice looking lady. Hedevelops a habbit of watching her on his screen.One day he logs on to her site and can't access it.He then proceeds to ""gain access"" to it. He viewshis ""internet girl"" as usual. Two seconds laterThomas sees his lady get slaughtered.The Police can not seem to help since the killer ismasked and Thomas viewed remotely. But then a beautifulpolice officer named Claire gets involved. Afterward,Thomas and Claire set up their own web cam hoping to attract the killer. Things really started to really start to get interesting. The movie was great until the ending."
3,Groucho Lives,The price was right but the product left a lot to be desired. I don't recommend this product unless you are using it as a gag gift as was the case with me. The glasses only lasted for a very brief 15 minutes before the broke at the hinge.
4,it was amazing,the depiction is so mesmerizing. It gives you the notion that not all cops are corrupt even though at times it seems to be.
5,The Magnesium Solution for high bood pressure,"Very informative. Dr. Cohen's book gives a better understanding of why magnesium is so important for mineral balance, particularly if diuretics are being used.His information is very helpful on applying proper diet and supplements in addition."
4,Excellent information,"I liked the information presented in this book, however, I contacted the author (as suggested) and found little he could do to support my concerns. As such, I wonder how the information was generated and what measures can assist the public with utilization of the recommendations provided. Thanks for the enlightenment on my path to self-empowerment."
3,Mildly interesting,"Very repetitive, as if the author didn't have a whole lot to say but wanted to fill a book. It was informative, after one plowed thru the repetitions..."
4,Excellent overview and springboard for discussions w/your doctor,There's enough research in this small book to provide a basis for discussion w/your Dr. concerning supplementation with magnesium. I take 3 Magnesium Taurate (from Cardiovascular Research) per day for heart health and also sleep. It has definetly helped keep me asleep without my usual awakenings. (Chelated mag. is absorbed w/o diarhea) I wish the book was updated with the latest on the various types/brands of magnesium but is surely contains enough info to decide if you may benefit from supplementation.
4,Just in Time for Me...........,"For years I had suffered from a side effect from my blood pressure medicine which was a cough that would become progressively worse even leading to severe congestion and at one time to pneumonia. It was 2 years of being sick before I found out it was my prescription medication that was causing me to be so sick. My only remedy was to cease taking it and my coughing, etc. would clear up - but my blood pressure would go up way too high as a result. I'm always looking for natural health remedies and was very thankful to find this book. I now take 250-300 mg of magnesium with each BP pill and so far my side effect has not returned! I am so very thankful for the info in this little book."
2,better get it from the library first,"Take the five books and make them into one book listing just about anything you can imagine(from spells to desciptions of every single person mentioned) and you have the ""Muggle's guide"". I was very disappointed because there was hardly anything new. Background information seemed to be mostly quoted from the official J.K. Rowling website-which existence was the only new information I got out of the whole book.(and you can look it up there online firsthand).I was glad, I got it from the library and didn't spend any money on it.Better and more entertaining is ""the magical world of Harry Potter""-where you can find good research of the meaning of latin and greek words used and connection to J.K.'s personal experience like the dementors are representing depression."
5,Good deal,Video is great. Good for grandkids to see the great Disney products. Product arrived quickly and great shape.
1,Didn'work,The DVD didn't work at all. I tried it in my DVD player and in my computer and it didn't work in either.
2,Where's soccormania?,"This dvd was released everywhere in the world with the rare tv special ""sports goofy in soccormania"".A 30 min special. It was removed from the american release.Why they did this is unknown.The dvd lost 30 min and we lost a rare cartoon the rest of the world gets but not america!Thanks alot disney."
2,Missed opportunity for Soccermania. All just re-releases.,"Boo to Disney. This is a missed oppertunity to give us what the rest of the world got: Soccarmania and its related cartoons. Instead we just get a very short re-hash of cartoons already on DVD:""CANINE CADDY"" (1941) - already on ""The Complete Pluto volume 1"";""HOW TO PLAY BASEBALL"" (1942) - already on ""The Complete Goofy"";""THE HOCKEY CHAMP"" (1939) - already on ""The Chronological Donald volume 1"";""DOUBLE DRIBBLE"" (1946) - already on ""The Complete Goofy"";""HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL"" (1944) - already on ""The Complete Goofy"";""MICKEY'S POLO TEAM"" (1936) - already on ""Mickey Mouse in Color volume 1"";""TENNIS RACQUET"" (1949) - already on ""The Complete Goofy"";""GOOFY GYMNASTICS"" (1949) - already on ""The Complete Goofy""."
4,Jag Panzer ROCKS!,I knew some girl named Mary who was friends back in the 80's with Pat and Rikard in Colorado Springs. She told me the band Rocked. I bought their CD's after that. They do. They kicked Tail back when Metal Ruled. They rival Metallica to this day. This is one AWESOME CD. Can't wait til they come back and ROCK NYC AGAIN! Hopefully SOON.
4,Great Heavy Metal!,"This is an excellent album. Every ascpect of it is incredible. If you like Iced Earth, Primal Fear, Iron Maiden, Judas Preist, or Blind Guardian, make this your next purchase; you will not be dissapointed!"
3,"don't turn into village people, you where fine as you was","this is the first example of this group & their creators henry belolo & jaques morali, messing with victor willis from village people & turning this fabulous group into routine disco pounding. the songs are village people funny, the rythms are village people danceable.... in total, the village girls."
5,The Best Mankind Has to Offer,This book contains many of the best poems ever written. The translations of the many non-English poems are mostly excellant. If the reader wants a big anthology of poetry- this is the first one I would get.
3,World Poetry as seen by a retired person,"As a person in their mid to late 60's, I was intrigued by the idea of ""World Poetry"". I could imagine such a book as what an alien from another planet might want to read to fully understand earth civilization. When I was growing up in the 40's and 50's, it was all pre-computer, and at school, we were taught to memorize a great deal of really excellent poetry. I can still recite from memory a lot of the poems we studied. Unfortunately, very few of those poems made it into the World Poetry book, and after reading all the poems, I can see that poetry is very much a matter of the time one is writing in. That is a pity but a fact of life. A lot of poems I feel are of world class are not in this volume, and I think the authors are wrong not to have included them."
2,THE BIG SHOW!,"Well if you are into it....I guess this CD dishes out exactly what you came for - white guy, high school rapper thing- but really now ..its more about slick production and naughty lyrics that will be as memorable as that tootsie pop you had last week. Next.."
1,Don't bother.,"I really enjoyed the last two Eminem CDs. I found them to be well-produced, great rhyme and beats and overall well written and very tounge-in-cheek. As a woman and a gay one at that, I could still appreciate the musicianship and talent Eminem put forth on his prior material, forget about the need for PC-values if the material is good enough to be incendiary.In this case it isn't worth not being offended - it's just creepy, insulting and frankly not clever at all. I received this disk on release day and was horrified at how bad it is - this album blows and I can't wait to ditch it. Gone is the musicianship in lieu of hate-rap - and the thing is that I don't see anything but a millionaire trying to shock with this ""effort"". Let him play with Elton John, etc. Eminem is the true ... and I think, given his current lyrics, that he knows it. ""Without Me"" is the only song on this album worth listening to. Save your money."
1,Utterly Apalling,"When will this all die out? Will people ever get tired of people swearing more then ten times every thirty seconds? Until they do, I shall turn a deaf ear to eminem and his peers..."
2,Aaaawww,"There's nothing wrong with a spot of harmless debate about such casual issues as animal molestation and the odd bit of homophobia!Only problem listening to this Eminem lad, is he started off somewhat sensible, and then proceeded to warble on incoherently about why it is that we should all **** off.He's a right old BUNDLE of fun..."
3,Keep Poppin' Them Pills Shady,"This album wasn't too bad, unfortunately I can only give it 3 stars though. I guess I bought this cd because of all the buzz it was getting, but as I soon found out, ""Business"" and ""Without Me"" seem to be the only two songs that were thought through on this album. Eminem's a pretty good rapper, despite some of his earlier songs and albums, so I'd say this deserves it's three stars."
3,average,"The problem with this CD is unlike some of eminem's previous music this cd lacks any real substance. The lyrics dont touch upon any worthwhile issues. Lyrics aside, eminem is still fairly talented at rap(but obviously not at the level of 2pac snoop or biggie) and thats why i give this cd 3 stars."
4,"Personal, by far most intimate Eminem album","I borrowed this CD from a friend, and ripped about 7 or 8 songs from it. (Sorry Em). But I do have the Marshall Mathers LP and Slim Shady LP, and I have to say that this is the most personal and introspective of his albums. By now we've all heard the first single, ""Without Me"", probably the most accessible track on the CD, its a more ticked off version of ""The Real Slim Shady"". Most of the other tracks are catchy, funky, angry, intelligent raps. Dr. Dre has never sounded better, and Slim himself improves as a producer (nothing sounds as bad as ""Renagade"" that he produced for Jay-Z) MY favorite tracks areBusiness, Cleanin Out my closet, Sing for the Moment, Without Me, White America, Till I Collapse (f/ Nate Dogg) and When the Music Stops (f/ D12). Its not as maniacal as the Slim Shady LP, and not as funny as The Marshall Mathers LP, but for anyone who thought Eminem was an MTV pop product with MMLP, this album proves them completely wrong."
3,not very good,"Being a previous em fan, i bought this cd. After a couple of times trough, i was pleased. But this album has no replay value. After listening to it less than ten times, it got stale. The beats are appealing at first, but not intricate enough to keep your atttention every time you listen.they are mostly too simple. As for the rhyming, em is always at his peak. But there is something about hearing the same thing in every song that turns me off to his music. It seems to me em came out with his debut album and was passionate about his rapping. His follow up album the marshal mathers lp was mainly about pressure and the public and his troubles. This cd is mostly about him whining. I say he should be a man about many of these ""issues"" he claims to deal with. Your better of listening to canibus."
3,Slim can rap....but his albums are average,Eminem started rapping in the underground circuit back in 1995. The kid can freestyle and write nice stories..Slim shady always blaze other mc's projects as well. remember Renegade of Jay-Z's Blueprint where Eminem went bananas on that track (he made the beat also)....Eminem's problem is the same as Wu-Tangs popular mc Method Man.....the production on this album is weak..the beats sound rushed and you can tell which songs were meant to be commercialized for selling purposes...sure the lyrics are hot and all that good stuff but there isn't much replay value to the Disc...
5,The Eminem Show,"This cd is great, anyone who likes eminem or just rap willenjoy this cd. Its got great songs along with some cool skits.Most the songs are good to listen, the best of course is Without Me. But unlike other cds where some songs are good and some bad. This cd all the songs are good and enjoyable. The extra DVD isn't much though, i bought and was a litle dissapointed. It doesn't include much of anything exept some old songs and videos. But if your an eminem fan this is the cd for you."
5,This is the best of Eminem so far.,"I have been a fan of Eminem ever since i can remember him coming out, even before he became ""big"" and this is by far the best i have ever heard from him. It still has the regular, controversal Eminem perks but it has more depth than other albums. He is actually rapping about reality and things that matter in his life to him and i think it is just great! I loved every single song the first time i hear them. But the best one on the album, by far, is ""Hailies Song"". I think it is totally great to hear almost a compasionate, serious side of eminem, especially when he is talking about his daughter. Overall, this is a great CD and i encourage everyone to check it out!"
2,First snoop now EM,"Another legend to bite the dust. The Marshall Mathers LP was and still is one of my most favorite albums of all time. This is horrilbe 1st snoop dogg acts like he is some type of pimp now Em is mature and calm. maybe i just grew out of him, he just dont flow like he used to. there were like 20 songs and only 6 decent songs i would be ashamed to say Eminem made it."
5,Another Eminem Classic,"Great album. The first two albums are definatly better, but its still one of the best albums ever made. The only track I didn't like was When the Music Stops, that song didnt impress me, other than that, the album is a classic"
5,Wicked AWESOME!!!!!,"This is pretty much the best cd ever! i love it! ignore the parental advisory. it's just some curse words everyone on the planet has heard. SO, get this cd! It's the BEST!!!"
3,golfingstud@yahoo.com Email me please,"Does this compact disc have any good Christians songs on it? Please email me if you know any. I am trying to get a full Christian music collection. I want all of the Christians songs out there please email me if you know any others, other than on this compact disc.Thank you and God Bless"
3,A Scared Little Boy Turned Rapper,"On this album, the so-called ""Detroit Demolisher"" moves away from his trademark sound toward a musical style known as 'rap.' It's an odd choice for someone like Em, but it often works. What's really amazing though is the emotional openness of the album. Eminem shows us the sad, terrified, crying little boy inside himself. He is afraid of the world and wants to be protected, even loved for who he really is. In this way, Em follows the sensibility of other ""open-hearted"" artists like Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli."
2,"Same old stuff, different package","This album is completely unsurprising, and there is no reason to buy it. Anyone familiar with the Marshall Mathers LP will find nothing new in this album. Anyone that listens to the radio has already heard half of it 300 times. Anyone that has the internet has already downloaded it a month ago.There are some people like this, I guess. I call these people sheep; the record execs call these people ideal consumers. Either way, Eminem has nothing new to say, and certainly nothing important."
5,Best rapper out there,"this album is awesome, it features great songs like cleanin out of my closet, superman, soldier, 'n lots more. he's the best rapper out there no doubt, AND he's got the looks. if u already r a fan, then this is a MUST buy. if u r a newcomer, i still recommend this, cuz it's an awesome album"
4,"Wonderful, considering I hate rap.","Pure genius. Only problem is cursing, because kids love this cd, but other than that, cd's wonderful. WARNING----------------------EMINEM + SERIOUS RAP = BAD RAP. It's uptempo and cool. Look for a clean version"
1,Try Again Eminem,This album sucks. Eminem thinks he's all that. Now i'm wondering why i even bought this album. I liked his first song-that was before i actually listen to the lyrics-someone doesnt remember where he came from.
2,Sellout!!!,"This is just proof that eminem could put crap on a cd and 10,000 idiots will waste there money on it. If you think this is anywhere near as good as his first 2 albums then you obviously have a drinking problem"
1,Why Can't He Come Out With An Original Album,"This album sounds exactly like the last one he released, which wasn't very good to begin with! There's not one original song on the whole CD, they all have the same beats and the same boring lyrics. The only worthy Eminem tracks that have come out since his first album are on other artist's CDs or on compilations, but as for his own LPs, they're utter garbage! Sorry Eminem, but enough of the ""rapping to angry white kids"" nonsense. Let's produce some quality raps here."
1,THE EMINEM SHOW,EMINEM IS ANOTHER HIGLY OVERATED RAPPER EMINEM IS NO GREAT RAPPERTHE EMINEM SHOW IS AN ALBUM I JUST CANT TAKE SERIOUSLY TRACKS LIKE EMPTY WITOUT ME ADD TO THE HORRIBLE DISPLAY OF RAPPING IF THATS WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO BE AVOID THIS ALBUM ITS WAK!!!
1,I just hate it,"Sorry, but this is exactly the kind of cd that I can't hear.I just don't like it, really horrible !"
2,Worse than expected,"This album has 1, maybe 2 good songs and that's it. ""Without Me"" and ""Till I Collapse,"" and that is only because Nate Dogg does the chorus. I like Marshall Mathers better that this one. Eminem is beginning to be like all other rappers....start out hot and fade off, with the only reason people buying their CDs is the hope that it'll be like the 1st album, Snoop Dogg being the main example. I recommend listening to it before buying it, and the DVD wouldn't make me buy this any more than just the CD."
1,Cleaning out your wallets,"Here's the version of Cleaning Out My Closet that Eminem really meant:I'm sorry peopleI never meant to hurt youI never meant to rip you offBut tonight i'm cleaning out your wallets.More whiny rantings about the critics, and Mom and his dysfunctional life. I'm sorry i ever took the least bit of interest in this guy. His act is old and has worn out its welcome a long time ago. His voice really sounds so immature. Like a little kid. Anyone who thinks he's so great and that he actually does great ""music"" needs to go play in the freeway. My farts have more entertainment value. I think 90% of his audience are white kids 25 and under. Pretty soon he'll be remembered as just a novelty act. It's a disgrace that he got a top ten song from this cd only because he ripped off a sample of an Aerosmith song. His cd will be good for wiping my bum with."
1,LAME WHITE KID RUINS RAP,"Oh boy, where to begin...Ok Eminem is some lame white kid who grew up in a wealthy suburban town with wealthy loving parents. Then this clown decided to dress like an african american and attempt to rap. And by rap I mean whine about how terrible his multi-million dollar life is. Boo Hoo I have fake mental problems and pretend my mom hates me! No suprise hundreds of lame rich white kids are buying his CDs and dressing like street hoodlums....then they go to college and become lawyers. What GANGSTAS!!! Go to the ""ghetto"" you won't see one person listening to this crap. Bottom Line: Eminem blows!"
4,The Eminem Show is good,"After Eminem's huge success, the pressure was on him to match up his sophomore LP. The Eminem Show is Em's most mature album yet and some may easily think it's his best. He shows his personal side here with songs like Cleanin' Out The Closet, Hailie's Song (featuring a crooning Slim!), and Sing For The Moment. His lyrics are deep and heartfelt on these cuts. Even Em's haters have to give him credit for his opinions. The best songs are Say Goodbye Hollywood, White America, Say What You Say, Soldier and Business. I definately recommend this album if you are an Eminem fan or if you are just getting into him. This may not be his absolute best effort but it does challenge his best. Ladies and gentlemen, Marshall Mathers is a man!"
2,Am I missing something?,"I'm reading all these rave reviews here - ""best ever??"" - andI mean, I love his prior albums as much as anyone, and songs here on which he actually raps and rhymes such as Without Me and The Light are dope indeed, but these repetitive trifles like Hailie's Song, Soldier, Superman, Squaredance???? BO-RING!!! It's like he couldn't come up with enough rhymes to fill an album, so just filled it with....filler. Wake me when his next album comes out."
1,Terrible!,"This is just fast talking and rhyming with bad beats and rhythmns in the background. Eminem has no talent at all. He talks about how bad his life was growing up and how it still is bad. His life is fine, he makes lots of money and he is famous. He should stop complaining. Why doesn't he go try to live in a third world country and see how bad his life would be then! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
5,HOTT!,"This is definitely my favorite album by Eminem so far. He gives his fans a glimpse into the mind of a superstar, and it's more than a little disturbing. (Hey, what do you expect?) The whole album reflects a much more human side of Em, and he gained some respect from me. Musically, and lyrically, it is the best album of the year."
4,Another great album from a lyrical genius,"This album is probably the best of the three albums put out by Eminem! ... All the songs on this album are undeniably good (and funny) but the best songs have to be ""Superman"",""My Dads Gone Crazy"", and I really liked tracks like ""Drips"". The whole album is good,and overall no matter how much people try to deny it Eminem is truly a lyrical genius. I would recommend this to anyone not afraid to know what REAL musicians think!!!"
3,Good but not as good as his other two,"I got this on an the day it came out and listened like three times. None of the times did i really care for it, but I figured it'd have to grow on me..it didn't. I'm more of a fan of horrorcore and as a result loved his first two, now he's just trying to be political and it doesn't work. All kinds of girly teenyboppers think he's sweet because of ""Haley's Song"" but come on thats one of the worst ones. I've lost almost all respect for him but My dad's gone crazy is listenable as is sing for the moment..there isn't much else for fans of his old stuff"
4,maturing of an artist,"im so gald that em is back, i rushed out and bought tha eminem show tha day it came out. when i listend to it i noticed sumthin different, he doesnt so much rap about pople he hates like N'sync anymore and this album is a very serious look in to his life, i think the deepest song on tha album wuz cleaning out my closet where he has a half apology to his mother. d12, obie trice, Dr dre, Nate dogg and even his daughter hallie all make apperances on this album to make a [heck] of a good cd. Tha beats are some of the hottest out now, theres a few little things about the album that arent that great but its no big deal compared to the amount of quaulity in the rest of the songs. this cd is not as good as the marshall mathers lp but its definatley worth the money."
3,Hmm,"I came into this album with an open mind, I had heard em's earlier stuff and thought it was cool, this album has like 4 good tracks, the rest are garbage. What makes alot of this album wack is the lack of battle raps and hard beats, theres too much of Eminem whining and trying to sing his raps and it sounds so wack. Don't get me started on the production, DRE still can lay it down but this album just doesnt have that head nodding zone out dopeness. I really dont understand all the heads on here talking about how dope this is, these cats obviously havent heard of Ras Kass and Del and E40 and the list can go on and on of tighter MC's than M&M. Good Songs...Business, Drips, When the Music Stops (Tightest Production on album and Bizarre's Bars make this my favorite), Til I Collapse (Cant F with Nate Dogg). Wack Songs...Without me (WTF? I know he aint tryin to cover Malcom Mclaren's Buffalo girls go around the outside) My dad gone Crazy, White America, Soldier Song."
5,simply great,"I was blown away with his talent!! Being a white, middle age woman, I'm probable not someone who you would classify as a ""typical"" Eminem fan. This was my first rap CD and I was hooked from White America on. I heard ""Cleanin Out My Closet"" on TV and had the desire to buy this CD. I am now definitely one of his fans. I won't rate every song like some of the other reviews but I will say if you are open minded and want to hear some great ""stories"" with great music to back them up, I would recommend this CD!! I loved every song, a few more than others.....I'm hooked and you will be too!!!"
5,Eminem Steals His Show,"Although Eminem is not the greatest prson in the world you can not denie his talent. His last D, Marshall Mathers LP, was wat you might say VERY different. The Best song's on the tack are White America, Cleanin out my Closet, Without Me, My Dad's Gone Crazy, soldier is good, and lets not forget Hailies Song, where he ACTUALLY SINGS! For the most part anyway. EMinem is one of the greatest because he speaks facts, and sometimes the facts do hurt. But he aint dissin me so who cares?"
2,No wonder there are so many protests...,"Eminems getting old. His lyrics make you want to commit suicide, He makes fun of everyone, including fans, every other word is a cuse word, & he talks about raping his own mother and ex. Thats exactly what we want the youth of America listening to."
4,It's about time!!!,"Great return for Eminem. Not quite as angry as the MM LP, but a nice comeback. The opening track, ""White America"" has the angry lyrics bouncing over a great beat and killer riff. Perfect song to start the CD off with. ""Soldier"" is another great track with that trademark extra fast rap style Em has. I'd put this album at #2 of his 3 LP's, with Marshall Mathers #1, and Slim Shady @3.It's great to have you back Em!"
5,"One of the ""MUST HAVE' for 2002!!","This album rocks! i wasn't a big fan of Eminem but one night i put on this album and loved it. His lyrics are controversial but if you can be open minded and get past that you will appreciate what he is trying to say and see that he has a good way with words and expressing himself. Eminem truly has a unique style. Tracks 8-10 are my fav's but the whole album is amazing. I've got a lot of my friends onto this one, Enjoy!!"
5,shady's back,"He's back again as he says this is his best album so far.And his production skills are very good and he also gets help from Dr.Dre who drops three great beats for Eminem.""Buisness"" is a song to look out for great beat and Eminem saying that he's back.To be honest every song on this album is very good if not excellent even ""Haile's song"" were he's actually singing and then for the final verse he goes back rapping.This album is he's most personnal record and I think that's when he's at his best.Cleaning out my closet is his ongoing problem with his mother and some of the lyrics are rougher than on the last record. ""Till I collapse"" feat Nate Dogg is off the hook banging beat and Nate Dogg brings it again as usual.The song were he has his daugther is very good and a great hook were she's answering to him.Every song is brilliant. You've got to get this album."
3,Not as good as it sounds,"This cd is only good if you are white, not something else. but i guess its alright. some good songs are without me but cleaning out my closet has the best message in the song by far."
5,Woah!,"This CD is awesome! He expresses himself way more, and also more serious! His last CDs were mostly him having fun, but 'The Eminem Show' tells a lot about his life, it's great! Anyone who has a problem with it jut has a problem with themselves! All of the songs are awesome!"
4,Not too shabby...,"It's not quite as hateful towards innocent people as his two previous albums, it's actually quite expected from him, although what I didn't expect was some of the ultra-sensitive lyrics about his daughter, Hailie. SO CUTE! Yea, well, I think it's great and some of the songs are pretty catchy, definetely a cd to listen to when you're angry, or working out."
3,hey,NOT FOR KIDS!!oh well i still like it because hes not afraid to let those feelings out........yes...yes...indeed. I heart him i think. i thinky.
1,No stars,"Eminem has no musical skills. All of his productions are awful. There is nothing more to say, it is that simple, really. Without MTV, nothing could have sold this guy. That's why he writes songs about himself to remind you how tough and cool he is in case you were intelligent enough to realize he is a dork. And a poser.Fin."
1,good reason to hate america,"No wonder most of the world thinks we are debased, filthy heathens when we treat scum like Marshall Matthers as royalty for being a tasteless, classless, faithless, shameless deviant. ""It'd be so lovely Without You"""
5,shady's back,eminem is backand better than ever. he still has the tightest flow in the game and is bangin out beats.i don't even know where to begin on saying how good this cd is but it definitely tops all his others
1,Eminem is a joke,"I have to say I once bought a Eminem Cd and i am nought proud of that, but this cd puts my thoughts to rest that slim shady is garbage. Nothin but a fake and cant even make sence anymore he is a disgrace to the human race because he makes are music look like a joke in my oppinion this is his worst album wit the wakest features ever dont buy it and make this white boy rich check out the new crooked I commin up playas"
2,Feminem,"This album was such a disappointment. After having 2 great albums he had to get big headed and do his own producing. STOP producing and let Dre do that. He lost a lot of street credibility with this one, I hope it's not a trend. As a prdoucer he's sooo average."
1,where to start????,"it must be so hard to be ""controverisal"" to 11-12 year Boys and Girls..Eminem is wack has and always will be."
1,This Album sucks,This is a terrible album but I will have it the guidelineson how to be a hip hop head.Personally I dont belive it isall that great but there were 2-3 good tracks but it seems likesame old same old I would like alittle variety its always abouthow bad your mama is and all about your girl who you doa crappy rendition of singing to just face it Eminem you cannot sing.I think any rapper working out of there basement can havebetter production quality this just sucks Dude it plainly sucksBuy The Slim Shady LP that is when Eminem was cleverand Fresh and not afraid to battle every fish in the sea-Sucks-Sucks-Sucks not as Bad as Missy Thought
1,"""I'D RATHER LISTEN TO WEIRD AL'S COUCH POTATO""",EMINEM CAN'T RAP PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. DON'T BUY THIS CD WILL SMITH GREATESTHITS IS JAMMING SO IS THE WEIRD AL SONG COUCH POTATO. WEIRD AL WON A GRAMMY DID EMINEM NO I WONDER WHY?
1,Eminem...Worst performer ever,"Eminem is a wasted unit. People got way to hyped up over him for nothing. Vanilla Ice is cooler to me, which is bad. Dont buy his albums, its just a waste of your time. Get something good, like red hot chili peppers, or incubus."
1,Eminem sounds more like NSYNC for every album,"When Eminem dropped the slim shady LP I thoguht he was pretty good but then he dropped Marshall Matters which was wore and now this:PURE POP MUSIC FOR WHITE PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED TO BUY BLACK RAPPERS ALBUMS...DON'T BELIEV THE HYPE, EMINEM IS REALLY CORNY! Buy TUPAC instead"
4,Not as funny,"Dont get me wrong I think this is a great cd. Its just not as funny as you would expect from eminem. There is a lot of political stuff on the cd, and it seems more serious than the others. I guess you just cant do the same thing all the time. And I think that Halie song that he sings on and doest rap much is kinda [different]. But I dont have kids so I wouldnt know. Well, this is a great album so buy it, and make eminem more rich than he already is."
3,"Not bad ,not great either","Not a great CD. I just can not get into the songs. As always his lyrical delivery is awsome, but the most of the songs are slow and unfullfilling. Best to me are Without me , and Bussiness. ... I wish he had used more hook songs because him and Dre can Delivery on that side. Not bad, not great."
4,Matured Man doesn't mean matured rapper...,"THis is his best album by far. You can tell he matured as a man. No more plotting how to rape his wife or kill his mother and wife. Instead, this comes out as a great rap album. IT's not the best, just a little bit short.The single ""Without Me"" is very good, which you can dance to. In, ""Halie's Song,"" Eminem actually sings in a nice falsetto. ""Drips"" is a sex romp with D12's Obie Trice.This CD shows a matured man, not necessarily a matured rapper. Even though he has cut down on the killing, he still talks about homophobia and such. If you like rap, this is for you. If you dont like rap, it is still for you."
5,Simply the Best,This is Eminem's best CD. It has stood the test of time and is the standard by which all of Em's CD's should be judged.
3,"High Hype, Disappointing Results","As a big fan of Eminem for the past few years, this lastest rendition of Slim Shady is very disappointing. None of tracks on the album are catchy-leaving you the feeling that the entire album was put together in a hurry or rush. Eminem needs to take this album back and redo his work. I believe that his second album is still light years ahead of this lastest effort."
5,The eminem show ROCKS.,"I think the eminem show ROCKS. Especialy number 19 and 20.(i think my dads gone crazy)is cool cause the little girl has a good part in the song. She pritty much discribes her dad very well for her age.hahaha. I think this album is so cool, and is a must to get.I listen to it every time i want to listen to some music."
3,the eminem show,I have always been a fan of eminem but in this album it truly shows his ability to entertain. He freely preachs his opinion complete with his famous curses. this album however seams more of a pop album than a rap and seams to be aimed more towards the younger generation. I feel that his first album was just the begining and this really shows us a side of eminem that has matured. I am not an extreme fan of this album(thus the 3stars) but I do think that many of the songs contained on it are great works of art. They contain truth and controversy and Im glad that we have at least one person who doesnt break it to us rapped in cotton-wool!
4,"""I'd like to welcome y'all to THE EMINEM SHOW""","While ""The Eminem Show"" isn't as great as ""The Marshall Mathers LP"", it is still a very awesome disc and should satisfy fans of his music. The best songs are ""White America"", ""Business"", ""Cleanin Out My Closet"", ""Square Dance"", ""Without Me"", ""Sing For The Moment"", and ""Halie's Song"". There isn't a bad song, but those are the ones that REALLY stand out. 3 CDs into his career it's obvious Eminem is one of the best rappers ever and that he can rap circles around other rappers who still get more respect because they aren't white. But Anyway, ""The Eminem Show"" is a great album that shows Eminem's skills as a rapper and razor-tongued lyricist. If you like Eminem' other stuff, get ""THE EMINEM SHOW"", its worth it!"
3,i dont like him,"his racial statements are distrubing that he could do that to a culture that he isnt a part of anymore i dont see how he could ever apear on BET or 106 and park this cd has a couple of solid songs but nothin new or creative the same old i invinted white rappers the game is nothing without me i mean who does he think is. Cage could rip you is 3 seconds even bubba sparxxx is more creative then you why do you make the same records over and over or you say that your gonna rape ur mom or kill somebody. eminem wouldnt have sold half of these records if he was black. and by the way canibus ripped eminem and could anydayFavorite Track:DripsGuests:Obie Trice,D12,Dr.Dre7 of 10 lyrics 7.5 of 10 beats"
1,The Beginning of the end of Feminem,"I used to be an Em fan until this album,what a sell out!Em can never be a consious rapper,get real...lolHis last 2 albums were good but this one made me lose interest in him.Oh yeah,bringing Curtis ""50 cent"" Jackson,made me even dislike him even more!To me,Ems a comedian rapper but that can only take you so far.His lyrics were wack and the beat production was horrible!I guess I'm not a fan of Pop rap,but hey look at the industry now,we got a lot of those.Feminem is one of the most overrated rappers of all time along with Jay-z,biggie,and lil wayne!Be warned don't buy this garbage album or Encore and save your money."
1,Get a Life,"OK Em will you shut up and get a life. The songs he sings are so disrespectful. Besides, rap is sad. Rappers have no talent. Rapping is the same thing as talking. C'MON GET A GRIP!!! I laugh when rappers try to act cool or are showing off. They don't realize that they look like such idiots! Like 50 Cent always talkin s*** about how got shot and crap. 50, do me a favor and SHUT UP!!! Eminem's fans must be as big of an idiot as him! If you wasted your money buying a sorry CD like this one,Your just as sorry."
2,Eminem = the most overplayed and overrated rapper in history,"... Eminem is far from the best rapper in the world...He raps about the same [stuff] over and over and over and over again!! Dont get me wrong, i aint discrediting him,just bewildered as to how this mediocre rapper gained such large appeal considering the boring substance of his songs..."
5,Yo Homie Gee.,"Hello. I am eight years old and i like M&Ms new cd. it is very quick and happy but also sad. I think the saddest song is cleaning out my closet, which i like to call washing out my room. It talks about how his own mother abused him and made him sad. It also talks about how she was poppin perscription pills in the kitchen b---hin! as you can see, it is very sad. i also like the song my dad has gone crazy. its about how M has gone crazy and can barely handle his dotter. I am very glad that M&M made this album and i love it more than my own mother!"
1,Hate-monger,"Please do not give your money to an artist who advocates extreme violence to women and gay people. This talentless convicted felon, druggie and street thug should not receive societal approval."
5,ALBUM OF THE YEAR,"I was really surprised by how good Eminem's new CD is,being that i have never really been a fan of his in the past. He has definitely gone through some changes--he has evolved as an artist and as a person. I don't understand how some people are giving this album negative reviews...but hey,there will always be haters who voice their opinions. I could go on and on with how incredibly great this CD is,but chances are most of you have already heard it,considering that it has sold over 2 MILLION copies! I know we are only half way through the year,but it is truly going to be hard for any other album to top ""The Eminem Show"" for Album of the Year!"
5,'Eminem' Seems A Little Cleaner and Less Badder,"In the Eminem Show, Eminem has plenty of songs. It seems the same old same. Every song you hear about Eminem's childhood, his ex Kim, his daughter Hailie, etc. You don't get bored though. The Eminem Show is a huge step up from the Marshall Mathers LP. 'Eminem Show' is lighter is easier to listen to. Some hits include White America (Eminem's political song) Without Me (a modern day 'My name Is', and Cleanin Out My closet (Eminem's introspection of his mother and childhood.) Each song is still packed with the usual, cussing and four-letter word tyrants on people such as his parents, Moby, Limp Bizkit, etc. Buy the Eminem Show is the main point. IT IS THE BEST of the the REAL SLIM SHADY... so far"
5,the eminem show is eminems best album so far.,The eminem show is the best of all of eminems albums so far. It has a ton of good songs. I don't really have a favorite. I like all of them except square dance. It just sounds gay.I know eminem will make more great albums!
5,Great 3rd Cd,"This is the best cd by Eminem I think it has some pretty good songs such as Without Me, Superman, Cleanin' Ot My Closet and Sing for the moment the other songs I did not mention there pretty good songs too Eminem is a total gansta rapper this cd is really must cd I would recommend this cd to any one"
5,Just abot the best out there....,"i am an extremely heavy metal/punk/goth person. i mostly listen to a lot of weezer and and good charlotte and stuff, but sometimes i'll listen to eminem, and he is definently one of the best musicians out there. ... the beats to the songs are pretty good, and i liked most of the skits. i didnt like steve berman, but everything else is awesome. eminem doesnt have to put a lot of effort into making a good album. its natural. and thats what makes it so good."
1,"Eminem was a great rapper,but now.....","HE SUCKS! When marshall mathers and slim shady were out, Eminem was my favorite rapper! but he sucks now. Dady's Gone Crazy was good, but that is it. Do NOT spend your money on this. I mean, this guy is rapping about killing his mom. I love my momma just like all people should. WHAT HAS HAPPEND TO YOU EMINEM?!"
1,will the real slim shady PLEASE SHUT UP!,"THIS CD IS WELL I WILL JUST EXPLAIN IT TO YOU HE IS VERY OFFENSIVE IN SOME OF HIS LYRICS. HE TALKS ABOUT HIS MOM IN THE WORST WAYS YOU COULD THINK OF BUT I HAVE NEVER MET HER SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE IS LIKE,BUT YOU STILL SHOULDN'T TELL THE WHOLE WORLD ABOUT IT. AND THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CD THAT IS NOT GOOD IT IS JUST LIKE YOU HEAR IT AND YOUR LIKE THAT IS OK BUT I WOULD NEVER BUY IT. NOW ON THE OTHER HAND HE IS KINDA SWEET ABOUT HIS SONG ABOUT HALIE AND HIS SONG WITH HALIE BUT EVEN WITH THE SONG WITH HALIE HE SAYS CUSS WORDS AND HIS DAUGHTER IS GONNA HEAR THAT YA KNOW? SO IF I WERE YOU I WOULD ONLY LISTEN TO THIS CD WHEN I COULD GET THE CHANCE IF MY FRIEND HAD IT BUT I WOULD NOT BUY IT FOR MYSELF BECUZ IT WOULD JUST GET ALL DUSTY SITTING AROUND."
1,WHY DID YOU DO THIS?I LOVED YOU!!!!!!,"and really!this is just a bunch of (...)by the same (...) artist.It is just (...).No (...) really,its just a (...) waste of time and money"
4,Eminem = 4 stars,"I like this album.But my favorite MM record is still his first one.But on this album Eminem tries different things like sings on the song called ""Halie's Song"".I like the way Eminem gets creative in all his albums that's what makes him so different than most rappers.I tell you one thing this Whiteboy can rap his [bum] off.He changed the face of rap 4-ever.Eminem keep doing yo thang playa.Also my favorite track on this album is number 12 ""Sing for a moment"".The beat from the song is from a older rock song , which I forgot the name of but once you hear it you'll know you heard it before."
5,The Eminem Show is about to start.,"I recently bought ""The Eminem Show"". Actually this morning. I hadn't heard any of the songs yet, and full og expectations I inserted the cd into the player. You get a little skit when the curtains go up, and then the song ""White america"" starts. The song is full of hate an feelings that you get the feeling of right away. The album is full of lyrics and beats which will make you listen to it over and over again. In the middle of the cd the now familiar song ""Without me"" starts, and later the song ""Hailies Song"" gives you something you aint heard before. Eminem sings the first to verses plus the chorus. In the end of the album comes ""My dads gone crazy"" which is one of my favorites. Hailie participates on the chorus of this song. In my opinion is this cd well worth buying. Go get your own copy, you won't regret. I got the special edition with the DVD. I haven't seen the Dvd yet, but I will as soon as possible."
5,Some Good Stuff!,This is a great CD (if you disregard Drips and White America)Till I Collapse is possibly the best rap song ever because you can listen to it over and over without getting bored of it and I'm surprised it hasn't hit the charts yet. When the Music Stops is good too and I'd recommend buying the CD just for those two songs!
4,Better than Previous albums,"OK the ""MARSHALL MATHERS"" was a stupid rap album ever. But this one ain't that bad.Some songs I like are:White AmericaWithout meSupermanSing for the moment (MY FAVOURITE)COP THIS ONE"
3,The best rapper?,"I used to detest Eminem for his attitude with other people who he doesn't like but he's a goood rapper. I really like the Eminem songs but rap isnn't my favorie kind osf music.He doesn""t mind what people will think about his life, and he expresses what he fells and he thinks about the world. Sometimes he criticizes everthing but it could be constructive and he tells the truth and discusses actual topics and situations taht other singers don't express in their lyrics. This cd is an energetic album ut if you have time to read the lyrics you will enjoy it."
5,Eminem Rocks,"This is the first Eminem CD I've ever bought. I loved this CD so much I bought The Marshall Mathers CD and The Slim Shady CD. I've alway's thought Eminem was a true talent but being a 32 year old mother of a 5 year old didn't find his CD's to be something I should listen to but after seeing the ""Without Me"" video I had to have the CD and found that he is one of the best artist I've heard. No I don't listen to him when my child is around but it's hard because I want to listen to him all the time.""Hailie's Song"" is one of the best songs on the CD and I think he really laid himself on the line to record it. ""My Dad's Gone Crazy""... I love the fact that he let his daughter do a song with him and it's a good song too.Oh heck the whole CD is great. Like I said Eminem Rocks. You should get this whether your a 32 year old mom or a 14 year old teen."
4,Ok but much much better when u hear it a few more times,"It was a good cd but nothing compared to the Marshall mathers lp. The raps were justa as good if not better but it was dr dre who couln't make up those cool beats this time. There werent as many swears (thank God) last album edited u couln't even hear him. The skits were horrible. but o well great cd, thanx Em. ill still buy his next album. (oh and 1 more thing) Eminem seemed 2 use his angry voice more in this cd if ya no wat i meen, example: nice voice=the real slim shady, Mean voice: the way i am. em used the mean voice in every track except without me."
2,doesnt measure up,This is no where near as groundbreaking as his previous efforts. Eminem used to be groundbreaking and now it seems as if he is trying to fall in line with every other 2 bit rapper on the music scene.
2,Overrated disappointing effort,"I was never a very big fan of Eminem. [I think] He is terribly overrated for an MC with basically only one style of flowing. While his first two albums were bearable, at least the first few times you heard them (except for the singles ack... Without Me sounds like he is trying to clone the success of the Real Slim Shady and of course the masses loved it. Then ""ohh what else would sell albums??"" how about a few sensitive songs so people could feel sorry for me, hence the tracks Cleanin' Out My Closet and Hailie's Song. Stay far far away... peace"
1,One word: CONFUSING!!!,"Eminem is a terrible white rapper that wants people to have a laugh and feel sorry for him. Screw you man! He tries to make a concept album mixed together with his childhood life which is mixed with some poor parodies on celebraties. The one thing to describe his little ""stories"" is that they're confusing as hell and have some sh**ty skits! Not to mention Eminem is the master of filler! Thanks to the skits and some stupid acting sequences during songs, you damn sure do a poor job of artifically lenghtining albums! Modern rap in general sucks and DO WE REALLY WANT A RAP ALBUM THAT'S 80 MINUTES LONG YOU FU**!!! The only good white rappers are the Beastie Boys(not their new album which sucked) and Zack de la Rocha from Rage Against the Machine. Avoid this album and you'll have a better life!"
4,Great for non rap lovers,"In listening, you can really get a sense of Eminem's life experiences. And the words he chooses to express himself with are truly amazing. This isn't just a cd for kids."
5,he just keeps getting better and better.,"I think this is Eminem's best CD to date and it completes Slim's presentation of his personalities. His production skills have improved so much in this album and even surpasses Dre on some tracks. and I honestly think that there is no bad song in this album. It's well worth the wait. So far, the best album of the year.Good Job Slim!"
4,"Good, but not like the others","I think this cd was good in some ways. It seems in this cd, Eminem has lost his touch for his musical talent. He has a few good songs like, I'm a soldier, White America, and Till I collapse. But it just doesn't seem to have the beat and style of his first 2 albums. But I still recomend this album to Eminem fans. But buy the other 2 first if you are going to hear from him the first time."
4,It Is truly the Eminem Show,When I heard the Eminem Show for the first time I knew that he's back.All of the tracks are hot 1-20. Each of the songs has meaning that what makes him one of the best rappers out there.If you haven't brought the cd yet you should because it is probably the best cd out there.
3,Ok,"Dont listen to the other people sayin this is a bad album...its not a bad album but its not a great album either. Yea his rhymes are good but his singing isnt (Halies Song) I think his other cds were much better than this one. Songs like ""Drips"" and ""Halies Song"" and ""Superman"" make this cd sound bad. ""Superman"" and ""Halies Song"" sound like they were only made to impress female fans. He may be the hottest selling artist at the moment and deserves to be with Loose Yourself but not with this album. If you want true eminem style pick up his first two cds they were very good."
5,GOOD!,EMINEM IS THE MAN. ENOUGH SAID. Can't go wrong buying this classic. This is one of his best albums in my opinion.
5,The Greatest Show,"The first time I heard The Eminem Show i was amazed.Probably not since Tupac has an artist ever been watched so closely and the media hanging on his every word.That's what makes this album so incredible.The pressure was on him to deliver and he exceeded the expectations.This is in my mind the greatest hip-hop/rock album in the history of music.The title fits the album perfectly as well.It showcases an artist at the top of his game and is a reflection of his life.On tracks such as ""Business"" and ""Square Dance"" I found myself in aww at the lyrics and untouchable flow.It's as if he is ryhming as if his life depended on it.This is truly The Eminem Show."
4,Pretty Cool,"Yes, make sure to listen to track #19. I promise this will be his next hit off of this cd. It may take a few times of reapeatedly listening to but check it out it as grew on me! On a scale 1-10 I would personaly rate it a 8.5. Laters."
2,"Same thing, different year","Eminem grew up in a trailer with his Mother who he hates and clawed his way up the rap scene even though he's white. We get it OKAY? No need to give us a history lesson on each album.My biggest problem with the songs on this album is that the ""music"" is little more than a few loops tossed together. Take away his rap voice-over and there isn't much there.This is more like a humor album, since Eminem whines about the price of fame and how it's ruined his life; so he puts out another album that's probaly going to sell several million copies?"
4,ThE eMiNeM ShOw,eminem in this cd just lets it all go he dont care what he says like on my dads gone crazy its pretty intense what he says about his mom. another is till i collapse him and nate dog just tear it up together a great song. without me awesome song im sure most of you have heard that song enough said there. if you want to know about the other songs looks like youre gonna have to buy the album later
5,Better Than Ever,"Back by popular demand!...This controversy guy is back to show how the world really works. His awesome quick response lyrics on any given topic is remarkable. This album makes his other albums look bad. Number one single is ""Without Me""...the song shows the true sense of Eminem and that in reality he is not a bad person. This Album is Number One...a must own! I don't know what to say its just awesome!...GO OUT AND BUY IT!!"
1,Moronic,"What do we have here? A fraud! I figured he was a fraudbefore all the stuff come out about his comments aboutblack women... When they come out it only made me believemore.What does he do here? He whines about his ugly ex wifecheating on him. That's all that comes out of this bizanyway is negitive garbage, so I guess he fits right inwith the crowd. A 33 year old guy that pitches fits likea 16 year old teenager. My gosh that takes real talent.This poor sap believes in his own mind that he is somesort of tough guy.. However, you can tell he would beunable to hold his own in a real fight. Got to admit,he isn't as bad as Vanilla Ice... But he isn't muchof a improvent either.He obviousally didn't clean out his closet enoughsince he doesn't admit to being the racist fraudthat he really is. One of these days he will reallywill get exposed for what he really is."
1,Out of ideas I believe.,"Eminem's third LP clealry shows how much this man is trying to still be up there where he was back when he first started. At first it was interesting bashing his mom, being angry, saying how he would kill you and all that gang-sta garbage. Now, it's pathetic. This man has more money than he could ever dream of aswell with success and yet he's still trying even harder to do it again when there's no need to. Besides, it's an insult how he could take Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" and flip it around like he did, converting a classic tune into a real waste of plastic.Unless you're 13, wanna wear P. Diddy's clothe and walk the walk, talk the talk and being close minded of what music is, then get it."
1,PATHETIC,"this is another pathetic album by a pathetic artist. he is a disgrace to rap and hiphop music. he is not hiphop he is hipPOP and his name is feminem. all y'all fans need to stay off his d!ck coz feminem aint $h!t, he aint what true rap is about, this album is another complete joke. he's laughing at all y'all ""fans"" when he is just producing crap like this and all y'all dumba$$es are giving him your money."
3,"good, but not as good as the last one","this album doesn't have the freshness or spunk of the last album, though a few of the tracks are very good. White America is very cool. So is Say Goodbye Hollywood and Square DAnce. A few of the discs come with a DVD that has highlights of some live concerts (Japan), which have the best songs from the last CD. After watching the DVD I was reminded why I liked The M.M. Album so much and why this one's not quite as good."
4,The Best Eminem CD To Date,"This album has it all...the regular Eminem ...talkin disses, Eminem singin, Dr Dre, D-12 and great lyrics. Ever since I have had this CD, it hasn't stoped playing. I personally think that this album is better than his previous 2 solo LP's, the D-12 album and his underground albums also. Below is my track rating (1-5):Curtains Up (Skit): 1 (very short intro)White America: 5 (expresses Eminem's surprise because of how people feel the same as he does)Business: 5 (Great song)Cleanin Out My Closet: 4Square Dance: 4.5The Kiss (Skit): 2Soldier: 5Say Goodbye To Hollywood: 4.5Drips: 3Without Me: 5 (the single, great, like his others)Paul Rosenberg (Skit): 1Sing For The Moment: 5Superman: 5Hailie's Song: 5++ (EMINEM SINGS!)Steve Berman (Skit): 1When The Music Stops: 5Say What You Say: 5Till I Collapse: 5My Dad's Gone Crazy: 5++ (features Hailie)Curtains Close (Skit): 1*Limited Edition DVD contains a music video, Eminem's movie trailer, and concert excerpts.*"
3,Not Really Too Clean,"I was really expecting the radio type version of clean when I bought this CD for my daughter, but just because the words are bleeped out doesn't mean you can't tell what they are. I like EMINEM and have the ""non-clean"" version, but I talked with my daughter about her clean version of the album and she says she knows exactly what he is saying because ""no other words would rhyme"". The scary part is that she cannot clearly comprehend why EMINEM says what he says and kids in their early teens have a hard time realizing that EMINEM is just blowing off steam; they take this stuff to heart sometimes. We ended up just burning off only the songs we approved for her to listen to."
5,This is A Mint C.D,"This is a great c.d, everyone should own it. The best songs are ""My Dads Gone Crazy"" and ""Cleanin out my closet"". Dont recomened this song to kids that are younger than 7. But everyone else u should go get one today. Cuz eminem is the best.!!"
2,Exactly...How did this guy become famous??,"This has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard. I beleive Eminem to be very overrated. His lyrics are violent, offensive and childish..Anyone who places Eminem above all-time greats like Rakim, KRS, Nas and 2pac Should have their head checked."
2,not as good as i thought,"this is by far not what i expected, the marshall mathers lp was much better than the eminem show. The marshall mathers lp was more in your face than this record, all of the songs [stink], there is not 1 song that you would want to listen to over and over. The only good thing about this record is the dvd that comes with it. There are way too many skits, and you would think that with everything that is happening in the world, eminem would have something better to rap about than getting std's from women, dissing moby, and petending that he's batman in half the songs"
5,BEST YET!!!,This is definately his best album yet. With 20 tracks all having excellent beats and well written lyrics this is a must-buy. Well done!
4,Outstanding!!!,"He's done it again!In The Eminem Show, we see that Em's lyrical skills are as deft as ever. As usual, the production is tight. Best tracks: #2,3,4,5,9,10,13,16,17,18,19. As you can see, fans will not be disappointed."
2,wow,eminem is an influence to most of us today but this realesage of his was not the best that he could of made it. his material was not as good in the unrealesed singles this time. slim shady should of spent more time on his new stuff before this was realesed.
2,wow,"after the great marshall mathers lp, this was such a disappointment for me. wtf happened to his voice? some of the songs seem repetitive and his lyrics forced. this album made me decide never to buy another eminem album. i still love the slim and mathers lps, but ah. wtf"
4,Not as good as the rest but good,"The beats are rather monotonous, however Eminem displays the sort of lyrical dexterity only otherwise seen in MatronsApron's Dan Bull. Em has something to learn about producing beats, but is a lyrical genius. Is he?"
2,stuck in car cd player,"It was ""slightly used"" never had problem before with my CD player in my car until this CD. It has been stuck in there for a week now and I can't get it out. Will never buy ""slightly used"" CD's again."
4,"Different, but that doesn't mean worse","This CD is pretty good. I think it's a lot better than The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. For one, there's a lot less unnecessary cussing (which I like). And the songs are much deeper. For instance, ""Hailie's Song"" (my favorite) is an ode to his daughter, and for those who have been hit close to home by divorce (as I have), this is a song that we all could relate to. ""Without Me"", while it disses plenty, as always, it also is a very fun party song and is a major hit. If you like hip-hop with a beat, humor and a message, this is the CD for you."
3,"It's OK, but not a classic","I have got to be the first to say, that this album is probably not gonna be a classic. It is ok. He could have came harder that that. Maybe he should have let Dr. Dre done the producing and he just kept with the rappin'. I wouldn't buy it, I would burn a copy of it. Kinda let me down, but some of the tracks are cool."
4,Boyz got talent,"When I first heard about EMINEM I thought ""Yikes, not another Vanilla Ice"" but I was sorely wrong. The lyrics and music are both catchy and clever and although you may find yourself skipping a song here or there, the majority of songs are worth the hearing. Being a lady, it's hard not to wanna shout - ""Quit it with the misogynistic stereotypin'""- which is just as bad and prolific a pastime as rascim - but the music and lyrics on most of the album make it worth buying. I can't help but conjure the image of EMINEM duking it out with his mom and ex-wife on the Jerry Springer show while listening to ""Cleaning out my closet"" which is funny and scary at the same time..."
3,Show Biz As Usual,"His rapping gifts are still in tact, but on The Eminem Show our Modern Martyr sounds tired. In of the songs on The Eminem Show, Mr. Mathers lashes back at and/or defends himself from all the miserable bastards out to get him. That might be nothing new, but the lack of narrative focus and comic invention is. He's never sounded self-pitying before - now that's his primary tone. Even so, the man is probably incapable of putting out a bad record. On The Eminem Show there are three great tracks: ""White America"", where he takes on the racial divide of rap, ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"", where he takes on (again) his mom, and ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"", where his precious Hailie Jade gets one over on Dad at Dad's expense. Elsewhere, it's show biz as usual."
5,Guess who's done it again,"This has got to be his Best CD ever. His Barrage of Lyrical madness is sooo crazy. This is a MUST, especially at this price! Take advantage of it now"
5,Yes!,"I am such an Eminem fan. This CD is the greatest. He is the best in the game and the best lyricist out there. Me being an Eminem fan, I take as much critism at school as he does, but I don't care. All I ever hear is ""Eminem sucks."" He doesn't suck! He is very talented. This CD proves it all. He didn't rip off an Aerosmith sample. The chorus totally goes with the song. It's the same with Dido's chorus. Cleaning out my Closet is also a great song. I think that white rappers are going to be huge within fifty years. I think they will take over the hip hop community because they are so much better at it, and you can understand what they are saying. So, if you love Eminem, buy this CD and don't forget to download his new song We are Americans."
5,I love Eminem,I truly love Eminem no matter what people say about him.People need to understand that he has a lot of anger that he needs to express and if music is the way he has to do it then so be it
5,Greatest Eminem CD,"This CD is very good. You have to be stupid not to buy it. The whole way the Cd is put together is great. My favorite song on this CD is Superman. That song is great. One of my favorite songs ever. Cleaning out my Closet, Without Me, White America, and Sing for the Moment are great too. You can not get sick of listening to this CD. Eminem and Jay-Z are the only good rappers out there."
4,so far all good,"I bought this charger with battery to replace my camera's charging unit and the batteries which are dying after 4 years. There was a initial problem with the detection of the battery and the camera kept on saying ""Only Li-ion battery"" for the first few times. Each time it did that the camera stopped working after intial booting and I had to restart the camera. This doesnot happen with my Sony batteries. However for the last few times the camera has stopped protesting and has yeilded good pictures with sattisfactory working time for each recharge. The charger is extremely attractive and light weight - hence easy to carry. If one has more batteries and want to charge a additional battery in car whie taking pictures this is an ideal pack."
1,I thought. . . .,"I thought that this movie was going to be really good. It was rated BETTER than Haggard! Needless to say, this movie was really disappointing. After reading other reviews, and seeing how well it was rated, I had high hopes for this movie. The only point in the movie that I really laughed at was a part with Ryan Dunn and Rake Yohn, and they were in the movie for an amazingly short time. I would NOT recommend this movie....AT ALL."
2,Review of Nature and Functions of Law,"The preview said it was like new; however, the first half of the book is marked through and the binding is loose. Not the quality i was expecting."
3,"COMPLEX AND NOT TOO CLEAR, BUT ONLY TITLE ON SUBJECT","As a user of SAP at a retail company, I was excited to see a title written on SAP specifically for retail. Retail is not one of the traditional industries focused on by SAP and its system shows a strong bias for manufacturing, so I was hoping this book would shed some light on the capabilities of the system that were being underappreciated at my company. Well, the result was that I was quite dissapointed after reading through it. First, the book seems to have been written in German and translated (poorly) to English, because the language is very choppy. Besides, there book lays out a grand vision of the architecture of the system without giving the user much idea on implementation or actual utility of functions. If you are ready to invest a few million on new developments, maybe this book is for you, but if you are looking for small improvements and ideas for medium-term development, this book takes too much of a birds-eye view to be useful."
2,"""Basics"" is Right!","If you're looking for a solid reference book on the topic of missile guidance, you'll be sorely disappointed. This is a very popular-press treatment of the field as it stood in the late 1950s, with a ""Popular Mechanics""-style illustration on almost every page, with a few pretty general paragraphs of explanation to accompany each picture.Even as ""collectible"", this has little appeal. The real audience for this book was limited to types like the Class-of-1960 nerd who ran the high school rocket club in the movie ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", and maybe a young pre-""Cheers"" Cliff Clavin. Reading this book may once have been really helpful in getting a Boy Scout merit badge."
1,Academic writing gets in the way of clear communication,"This is a classic case of academic writing getting in the way of clear communication. This book may have many interesting things to say, but as a reader who holds two master degrees, I still couldn't make out most of its content. The writing style is unnecessarily complicated and exoteric. It is also full of vague and high sounding language. It is a very frustrating book to read. I am able to learn a few useful concepts here and there from the book, but I'm confident that there are other books that can teach you the same things with a lot less money and time investment on your part."
2,Absolutely not worth the price,"Lots of technical words and a few exercises and examples make this book absolutely not worth [the money]... if you want to learn the basics of the singing voice and technique look somewhere else! This book does not help at all... too complicated, with its 372 pages it looks so full of things, but in reality it's totally empty of concepts. 60 pages of bibliography, other 60 pages of medical research... and in the rest of the book (that is 250 pages) you can find maximum 5 useful concepts about the singing technique... the same ones that you can find looking around on the internet..."
5,Buy this book,"If you want to learn how to sing - and add a few new words to your vocabulary, get this book. To those reviewers who find fault with Mr. Millers fancy words: Grow up and get yourself a freakin' thesaurus and/or a dictionary. This book is full of info on singing, from breathing to forming vowels to taking care of the voice. Lots of exercises. I've read other books on singing, but this book is better than any of them. If this book doesn't make you a better singer, then it might be time to think about taking up mime instead. So, do yourself a favor - buy this book."
5,The Structure of Singing,"I purchased this book as a textbook for a course in vocal pedagogy that I am enrolled in. I have found this book to be very useful, not just for those who want to teach voice, but also for students of voice, and for anyone who is generally interested in how the vocal mechanism functions. This book is full of useful information on the functions of breath support, muscle groups that aid in the singing process, and resonance balance, and has many useful diagrams as well. It also contains many exercises that aid in vocal agility, vowel differentiation and sostenuto. This book would be a valuable part of the voice teacher's collection."
4,Not for beginners,"You'll find that people say this book isn't for beginners. They're right. I didn't listen and bought it anyway and didn't understand the majority of it. I'm trying to teach myself to sing and this is way out of my league. However, I gave it 4 stars because it seems like it could be very good for someone who's already had years of voice lessons and/or is currently taking them."
2,"Should have stayed dead, sorry","I actually enjoyed the (first modern version) NOTLD 3-D with Sid Haig, and this is made (I believe) by the same person/people, and just goes back like a prequal, to the Sid Haig film. It just would appeal to those who are zombie fanatics (real, fanatics), and I felt the story was just preaching to the choir, we got the gist of this all, already, from the original Sid Haig edition. But I figured, Wal Mart was selling it on the $9.00 bin, so that is all I'd be out. One single zombie moment was a true visual treat for the extent of make up, the rest was - um, er, yeah. Story was flat feeling, disjointed and ........well I don't begrudge the $9 I spent, I spend more for a pizza and toss the box when I'm done........so there ya go. Please rent first before you buy."
2,We love Zombies .. but this was not very good,"Maybe now that we have an excellent zombie TV series available to watch each Sunday night (AMC's WALKING DEAD) --It raises the expectations for even B-level Zombie movies.We love Zombies, but we simply could not sit thru this.Pretty bad."
2,Worst of the Dead Movies so far.,"Ok , I for one love campy zombie horror movies but, this one is a sad attempt at a remake. Worst ever acting, staging, cinema-photography and script. Several shots (actually many) are computer generated that do not need to be. So I am wondering, is this bad editing or did the crew re-film stuff after the production. Zombie reanimation from chemical laden body bags are now reanimating the recently and not so recently departed. The main character has stored bodies that were due for cremation ""the oven"" in a room, (computer generated scene room???) at his mortuary and now they are reanimating, some took a long long time and some come back sooner and slower. This story was just not even good for a campy movie, all I can say is viewer beware. But if you are a true zombie fan, then it is a must see,.... Let me know what you think when you do get to see this one...."
3,"For the zombie fan, not too bad","This movie is a spiritual sequel to the NOTLD3D with Sid Haig. It explores the story of that movie with greater detail. If you haven't seen it, you should watch it first. It is an original take on NOTLD. There are many homages to the zombie genre in here to please fans (it's a Romero Zombie!). It does move slowly compared to other versions of the tale, but they try to expand on the characters. It is not nearly as bad as the reviews indicate, if you take into account my points listed above. Sit back and watch an original."
3,"Not bad, coulda been better.","Andrew Divoff did a good as the creepy mortician and Jeffrey Combs did good as his odd greedy brother but this movie is somewhat boring, the zombie makeup and gore was awesome but you really don't get to see much of the zombies. Mostly just a room full of rotting corpses and a few of them re-animate. It's not terrible but not great either."
3,U Get What U Pay 4,"The 3D effects were pretty good. I am a huge Zombie fan and I knew Jeff Combs before his movie career took off. I was disappointed with the storyline as well as the acting, but it's worth watching if ur a die-hard fan like me :)"
1,Wretched!!!,"I had no plans of writing a review of this film as I hoped to put it out of my mind forever. Then Amazon sent me an e-mail asking me to review it. I thought that if I could prevent one person from watching this movie, then I could die happy. The film has nothing to recommend it save the presence of Jeffrey Combs (and he looks like he's only in it for grocery money.) The rest of the movie is crap. Watch virtually anything else and you'll be happier."
1,The reviewer is a shill,"I don't know anything about this camera's quality, but click ""See my other reviews"" for the reviewer ""Scott Edinburg."" He has posted the EXACT SAME 5-star review for every camera made by this company.How can you trust a company that does that?"
2,What if you wasted your time and money on this?,"What if some of today's most popular writers wrote meandering, pointless stories about some of our favorite characters? What if you wasted your time and money reading them? Unfortunately, I know the answer to both of these questions."
3,Well structured Law Text Book,Easy to read and good to use for additional reading. Good explanations of Dutch Employment Law. Recommended.
4,Vivement dimanche,"Vivement dimanche is a complex and fun take on film noir. There are all the usual elements: murder, disceit, mistaken identity, romance, infidelity. Truffaut's touch is ligth but masterful. His actors hit the right tone."
2,Not what I expected,"I have listened to Charles Ciepiel's beautiful voice sing Psalm 119, and bought this based on that. Not at all what I had hoped. I am disappointed with the arrangements he used. Was hoping for more of a contemporary sound."
3,Use Sparingly For Best Results,"After receiving a sample of this perfume, I ordered some for myself. It seems somewhat stronger than the sample but still acceptable. Don't over-apply or you will be detected from a long way."
5,Very Nice,I love this fragrance. This is my second time buying this. I alternate this one with another fragrance I use for everyday use because it is not overpowering but light enough and still manages to linger for a full 8 to 12 hours.
2,Aspen meets Pleasures,"Not a big fan here. I found it too sharp and overwhelming. It has incredible staying power, which is great if you like it! To my nose, it's as though Aspen and Pleasures were mixed... a little on the minty/masculine side (the Aspen) and very sharp/crisp floral (the Pleasures). I like Pleasures, on occasion, but I never have liked Aspen or any similar scents (Cool Water, etc...). I think this could work with certain chemistries, however. I'm going to have my mom try it to test that theory, since perfumes smell completely different on her, than I. I'll update afterwards!"
1,Terrible,Has anyone ever bought this book that wasn't taking his class? Everyone at the University of Pittsburgh knows that Dr. Chang is a joke. It's time for time to retire.
4,PT,"This cd I didn't really like at first. But the more I listened to it and the more I got into his lyrics, I loved this cd. It definitly isn't a classic, but I still will recommend this cd to anyone simply because PT is my favorite rapper"
4,The Pastor is Back,"Pastor Troy is the cruckist rapper out of ATL. He also is one of the cruckist rappers ever. With ATL. growing and so much music is coming out of ATL, Pastor Troy is giving his fans the same thing ever time. Personaly I think he is trying to hard to go platnuim but there's to many people buying the bootleg than the real. This is not the best album but it is hot!"
4,review,"Pastor Troys sophomore album is full of the threats and bragging that he is known and loved for. From start to finish, he contiuously reps the town that is he from, Atlanta Georgia. Pastor Troy is the epitamy of producer driven rap. Theres a big cew amosphere on this album, great stuff, pick it up."
2,Dissapointment,"This is easily the worst of Pastor Troy's 3 mainstream CD's. I thought it couldnt get much worse than Universal Soldier but boy was I wrong. Troy should stick to just making underground CD's cause Hell 2 Pay was some serious heat. Notice to Pastor Troy, stop trying to sound so [darn] commercial cause it just dosen't work for ya brotha.This CD is 13 tracks long and the only tracks worth nodding to are the track #1 (the intro), track #12 featuring Juvenile and Lil Pete, and track #13 (F*** Them Ni**az). The rest are just filler. Heavily dissapointed in this CD. Troy used to be the GOAT out of the South, but now David Banner done took his spot."
5,Still Making Hits,"Pastor Troy continues to rep Atlanta well in his new album. Believe me this album is clearly worth buying. He has songs on there for everyone. Compared to other albums out there right now from Lil Flip and Master P, this album clearly ranks above them all."
5,Pastor Troy Aint Afraid To Be HARD,Atlanta is off tha chain for real... And anyone really throwin up the city is thumpin PT. Universal won't give him any publicity but he still manages to be the biggest name in Atlanta. He defines crunk. Pastor Troy brings a lot of energy to By Any Means Necessary which is one of his most versatile albums. 5 Stars.. Cop this Fill YA CUP AND GET CRUNK
4,Solid,wats good his album is solid nah mean. It isnt the best troy lbum but its bumpin.This clown music man need to get a life if u keep knockin a niggaz album why u keep replying to all of them? An to that other clown g. kubrack aare you even black yourself? If you not your whole review is irrelevant. What would you know about g. rap?
1,Troy fails this albulm,Pastor troy is a good rapper by all means but this albulm was a big disappointment to me compaired to the other three albulms that came out this is by far the worst crap ive heard in a while. Who really wants to hear rappers boast and brag about what they got its pitiful through out this whole cd there was nothing I really liked even the beats were weak. This cd was a waste of money do yourself a favor and avoid this cd if you are a fan of his work.
3,Major Disappointment,"This album was a major disappointment. What the hell were you thinking Troy? Especially on the song Benz. This is the corniest song I have ever heard. Pastor you are the last person I would expect to make a song like that. It just seems to me like Troy was trying to go mainstream to sell more albums. Man, just keep doin what you have been doin.... giving us that gritty hard music that you have always made. There are a couple of good songs on here but this is the worst album Troy has ever released. TO ANYONE WHO HEARD THIS CD BEFORE DSGB'S NEW CD... DONT LET THIS ALBUM KEEP U FROM BUYING THE DSGB CD... BELIEVE ME THAT ALBUM IS GOOD AND WORTH YOUR MONEY... if you are a pastor troy fan I would say for you to pick this up and be your own judge. becuase some people seem to like it, but im not feeling it. And we all know that Pastor Troy deserves more respect than people give him, but this album just isnt on his level."
1,another mentally handicapped rapper,"raps are straight stoopid (do any of you actually listen to the lyrics??) with no depth. just a bunch of low class black guys high as kites talking about garbage with some wack beats. hey, if thats your style, then you may have a head injury. if you are looking for ganster rap, pick up any project pat cd. he puts this punk to shame"
2,Mostly fetish. With a few good photos mixed in.,"I agree with the feedback provided by other reviewers. It is not a book for couples depicting conventional love, lust, and desire. Instead, it is heavy on various types of fetishes. Some pictures were good, some had potential, and others I never ever wanted to see again. Generally speaking, the images were more designed for shock appeal, to portray a scenario, or to creatively express a feeling than anything else. Nearly every image had something extra added to make it over the top - hoods, shackles, leather corsettes, etc.I rated it as two stars because I was able to find it useful for my purposes. I was looking for useful art for creative ideas at a low cost. So, I tore the book apart, kept the images that I liked (or would if they were toned down a notch or two), cut out the images with sections that had potential, and tossed the rest with no regrets."
2,"Not really, in the eyes of this couple...","There is no doubt that this is art, but ""masterpeices of erotic photography for couples?"" Probably not in eyes of most average heterosexual couples (our limited perspective). Although there are a few examples of notable erotic photography included, most images are too abstract or too extreme to be of interest to the average reader. If your library is full of erotic art and you are looking to expand around the edges, by all means purchase this book. However, if you are a couple looking for beautiful erotic photography you are much better off starting with a title like ""Couples"" by Stefan May."
2,Doesn't fit in Brother HL-5070n,"It fits in Brother HL-5070n, but not very well. It gets stuck and takes more force to get in and out than did the factory drum. Also, our ""replace drum light"" never went off after adding this non-Brother-made replacement drum."
3,OK product,"It was a good deal, especially compared to the sets you get in stores, but the ink seemed to run out pretty quickly. Within 10 drawings on marker paper, it seemed to start running out of ink..."
2,Pay more now or way more later,"As an industrial design student I use markers often. These were the first Cool Grays I purchased, but not the last I needed. The shades are not uniformly spread across a gradient. For example, the 20% is much darker than the 10%, and extremely close to the 30%. It won't matter about the 10% though, because it will dry out within a couple of weeks, and you'll need to replace it. After 4 months, and two dried out 10% markers, I stepped up and bought the other leading brand (see my other reviews). I am much happier with the performance of the other brand, and I won't be buying the Prismacolor again. Spend a little more now to get the best, or a lot more later replacing these."
1,Another Ripoff!!! This album is not new,This is another Release for the 3rd or fourth time. I bought another album in 2000 Titled Lita Fords Greatest Hits Live and This release in 2011 is the same as the other live Lita Ford albums released They have different covers but their the same thing also they still didn't fix the one track that was instrumental I'm talking about the ripper. So before buying check out more info on it Cause you'll be getting the same album over again!
4,MORE PLEASE!,I learned a lot from this useful kit. I enjoy the meditation tape and have found it to be very calming and energizing.This person's voice is very easy to listen to. My only complaint is that the meditation ends sooner than I really want it to! My solution is to have a second tape in the cassette player so I can deepen my meditation.
4,A very interesting book,"This book is a very interesting book, I usually don't read mystery, but I found myself reading through it, unable to put it down for long. The plot is appropriatly suspensful, not letting you know what was really going on until near the end. The romantic subplot going on through out the story was not over done to the point where you forgot that the story was a mystery and not a romance.If this writer were to write more books I would probably not hesitate to buy them, despite not being a fan of the genre."
2,shortlived fun and frustrating,"My kids got this for Christmas. While they enjoy it for very short periods of time, they also get frustrated easily and call for help especially my 6 year old. The comments made by the movie characters are cute the first couple times but after that they are annoying and you can't avoid them or stop them. As you progress through the game's higher levels the game changes so little it's boring. The longest they play is about 15 minutes maybe once a week and that's pushing it."
5,A great addition to your cycling DVD collection!,This collectible box set is a must-have if you are a fan of mountain biking. It traces the history of professional downhill biking and walks you through how the sport has evolved in recent years. Simply awesome!
5,Another great album by Bang Camaro!,I would recommend this album to heavy metal fans who are wanting to add to their collection of outstanding performers!
5,Old school rock with a new school sound,"This album is a tremendous upgrade from most other modern rock. It features 80's style riffing and a choir of singers. The lyrics are cheesy but fun, and there aren't many lyrics so the whole choir of vocalists idea is not overdone. The music focuses on tasty riffs and incorporates many guitar solos and harmonized breaks. The music doesn't sound forced or overproduced, instead you have a overlooked masterpiece. If you like old school rock/heavy metal, I would suggest giving this a listen."
1,not worth your time....,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE films like this. I watch them all the time and rarely dislike one. This is a time though. This movie was about as annoying as a movie could get. Daisy (Cybil Shepard) is rambly, talks too much, is disrespectful, flirtatious, and hasn't one bit of class. With no disrespect at all to Henry James, the story has no substance. He kills her off in what seems like an effort to avoid letting us know if she actually is a wild one or is innocent, as Winterbourne wants to believe. I guess we will never know... not from this version anyway! It is just an annoying film and Ms. Shepard does nothing to make it better. Avoid this one...."
4,701XP Clipped Head Framing Nailer,"This review does not reflect on the quality of the product. I have always purchased Senco nails, when possible. They have generally always been well built, lighter weight and easy to handle and maintain.I live in California. After ordering the nailer and before even receiving it, I learned that the codes here no longer allow the use of clipped head nails.I was quite disappointed because I have used the 601 which is a wonderful nailer.We did return the nailer and had no hassle in receiving a refund. Never even had the chance to fire it!"
4,Good stings from the german band,"I was never a huge Scorpions fan but I did like them, and the fact is they have many really [...] songs. This collection is one you should own if you like 80's hard rock. The only thing missing is a good live version of Rock you like a Hurricane, but is wishful thinking. Anyway get it and enjoy it."
3,You know you like it...,"or you wouldn't be thinking about buying it. Seeing as they don't get much airplay anymore, this album is worth buying for ""Still Loving You"", ""No one like you"", etc... Go for it. And buy Judas Priest's Greatest Hits while you're at it."
4,"Great compilation, but...","...it could have been better. The new tracks are so-so; there's one too many songs from CRAZY WORLD; and ""Still Loving You"", ""Believe In Love"" and ""Alien Nation"" are edited. On the plus side, the sound quality is excellent and there's just under 80 minutes of music here. Here's what should have been instead:1. Loving You Sunday Morning2. Lovedrive3. Holiday4. The Zoo5. Blackout6. No One Like You7. Rock You Like A Hurricane8. Big City Nights9. Still Loving You10. Believe In Love11. Rhythm Of Love12. I Can't Explain13. Tease Me Please Me14. Don't Believe Her15. Alien Nation16. Wind Of Change17. Send Me An Angel"
3,enough of collections scorpions!!!!!please give us the 70s !,"another best of,the same songs,nothing from the roth era,a list of songs from their mercury era,a complete feast of rockers and ballads which scorpions adopted after roth left.this album is meant for the united states(all the songs here are big hits there).......2 new songs,good ones though,typical,formula following vintage scorpions.i really don`t agree with the idea of adding new tracks to a ""best of album""....it should only have their best songs.........how many stars should i give?3 maybe for some really fine tuned scorpions,there`s no scorpions without what they`ve given to us in their early days(70s generally).......loong time scorpions fans would agree with me!!..........one more thing i`d have given 5/5 stars if the album name was ""best of mercury era scorpions""!!!howzz dat?!"
2,It's just okay. I rate this album 2.5 star,"I thought this album would be better. Sure it has all the hits that a casual fan of the band would want to have on one disc. That's the problem with the album. There isn't any good songs once you listened to the ""hits"" with the exception of the song ""send me an angel"" Their cover of the Who's ""I Can't Explain"" is not listenable it all.To sum this review up. I dissapointed with it has a whole. Buy it at your own risk!!!!!"
3,Not as good as I would have liked,"This is not a bad alblum, but I think that there are far better Scorpion songs that the could have included on this CD."
4,"Great music, but missing 2 songs","All of the song on this CD are excellent, but two of their best are missing. The first is their excellent cover of Kansas's Dust in the Wind from Acoustica (a DVD). The second is Ulrich Roth's Sails of Charon, an incredible unknown song. So in short a great collection froma great band, minus the superb Dust in the Wind and Sails of Charon"
1,Why do I rate such great songs so low?,"I've always been a Scorpions fan, even from the 70's. I love their music, and this album does contain their greatest hits. If I had this in the CD player, I would never hit the skip. Then why do I only give it one star? Because in the last few years, I've only seen one album with ""new"" material, and it was the same songs with an orchestra playing with them. In other words, if you're new to the Scorpions, this is a great one to get; if you're familiar with them, then you've had all of these, minus the last two songs, since 1993. Come on guys - get some new material or just retire; we've already gotten too many compilation albums!"
3,Missing their best song,"Their best song, in my opinion of course, is ""I'm Leaving You"" and it's not on this compilation. Thus, it is fatally flawed."
5,I RECIEVED CD SCRATCHED,"You Guys, lol 5 stars for the choice I made.....0 stars for I recieved the cd scratched. And I would like my money refunded....A.S.A.P. Whats going on there?John VanBezooijenj.vanbezooijen@insightbb.com"
4,Get stung.,"At this point, all hair/metal bands should have a collection out, and this is the one you want from the ""Scorpions"". It may be missing a few songs, but all the big ones are on here, 18 tracks worth. Included is ""No One Like You"", ""Wind Of Change"", ""Still Loving You"", and the huge ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"". There's also a great cover of The Who's ""I Can't Explain"". Other good songs are ""Rhythm Of Love"" and ""Send Me An Angel"", though they may not be the songs the casual fan thinks they are. My fave might actually be ""Don't Believe Her"". Overall a great collection of classic tracks, with two good new ones."
3,A book for backyards BBQ,"Take a sunny 4th of July, hamburgers grilling in the backyard, a cold beer at hand. You sit down and chew the fat with a man who flew Hornets for the Marines during the Gulf war. He tells you his stories from an anecdotic point of view. Put that chat into a book and you get ""Hornets over Kuwait"". It does not put you ""in the cockpit"", not lay any literary claim. It dose leave you though with the pleasant feeling of a friendly Holiday chat."
4,Good,I like learning about the past. This is a conflict that I didn't keep up on. It is even better when the person was there living it.
2,"Great price, wasn't compatible","One computer could only utilize 512mb, the other wouldn't recognize the ram at all. I figured it being Kingston RAM and this type of RAM being around so long that it would be compatible with any computer requiring 533MHz DDR2 1gb RAM. Guess I was wrong."
5,Very good value,I maxed out the RAM on the computer with two of these. No problem with the install. A good investment for the future of the machine. I will certainly be buying more of the KingstonValueRAM line for others of my computers.
3,Ram,"Seems like a good product, but didn't work in my computer so I had to send them back. Not much else to say."
4,Reasonable purchase,I would say a reasonable buy. No problem at all as I'm using this ram in a system for the last couple of months. I would definitely recommend this seller to others.
1,Kingston memory,The Kingston 533mhz 1GB was used andI thought it might have been worth a try.My mistake...it went bad a couple of days after use.
1,The Fourth Little Pig,"What makes this book so expensive for children?? Even at $60.00 used, it is still way over priced."
3,Not the same item,I have had a Conair straightening brush for years and loved it! When it broke I couldn't find another one in stores so purchased on line. The brush I received is not the same as the one I had before or as pictured. The bristle base is much wider on the new one and it doesn't collapse for easy storage. I haven't used it yet - so can't speak to how it performs. Hopefully it works just like my old one - which was GREAT while using my flat iron.
5,excellent,I love this item! It is the only way I get my hair straight! The only down-side is that it breaks about every 3 months and I have to get a new one.
2,no as claimed,this product is not as claimed. its not that easy to use as they say. I would not recommend to buy this. if I could return it I would.
3,not for the serious student...,"Massey's *Slavery in Ancient Rome* is a brief introduction to the topic that would be perfect for any high school library or, perhaps, for someone who wanted no more than a basic overview of the subject. While it includes lots of citations to ancient sources, its lack of secondary citation and somewhat confusing organization make it unsuitable for anything else. For more thorough coverage, get Keith Bradley's *Slavery and Society at Rome* and Thomas Wiedmann's reader entitled *Greek and Roman Slavery*."
3,South will rise?,"This group of essays fits well into the history that made it. While almost all of them are clouded in Agrarian sentimental romanticism, the longing for a better time is a good theme to latch onto. One or two of the essays aren't really worth reading, as they border on complete and utter boredom. However, as with any book, there are messages, important social and historical ones, to be taken away from the book. Applied to recent times, it gives a unique persective on self-determination, tyranny, and even the confederate flag."
2,I'll Take My Stand : The South and the Agrarian Tradition,"Why would you post the offensive, poorly written screed that is featured in the review section of this book? It's insulting and wrong-headed. At the center of the Agrarian position was a retrograde turn to Jeffersonian agrarianism, which was a self-serving fantasy in his time - the South the Agrarians argued for never existed, and their resistance to industrial capitalism thinly veils a false nostalgia laced with racism and elitism. The reviewer not only attempts to sidestep this, he does so in such clearly defensive and insulting language that his posting does a disservice to your site. I'll Take My Stand deserves to be reexamined mainly for its influence on neoconservatives."
1,Black Views?,"I wonder what poor black Mississippian cottonworkers have to say about agricultural traditions in the south. Didn't find any black opinions. This is a terrible book, in Holland (where I come from) and Switserland (where I live) it would be forbidden."
3,"Sharp looking, but not up to Italian standards for footwear....","Nice shoe, with a great finish. You can pull off wearing these with high quality jeans or even a suit. However, they have rubber soles, which are actually not mated well to the shoe itself in several areas. I guess one can't complain for the price they're clearing them out for...we'll see how long they last."
3,Shiny shoes,"These shoes were a lot dressier than I thought they were, I wanted them for everyday shoes to wear with dressier jeans and slacks. These shoes are very shiny almost like tuxedo shoes but they look really nice and the price can't be beat."
4,Larger Size than Expected but good quality,I normally wear size ten shoe but size was much to big for me. I sent it back and reordered a 9.5. Good quality shoe and happy with it.
3,Carol,These shoes were very shiny almost a patent leather. They also are quite stiff. I will probably stick with other brands.
4,Nice Shine,"I was apprehensive buying shoes without trying them on. I have owned serveal pairs of Bostonian Oxfords and know the comfort they bring after a long day of meetings. For the price these shoes are unbeatable. I could not give a 5 star rating due to the fact they have a weird ""new shoe"" smell."
4,Nice Dress Shoes,"The shoes were received in a timely manner, even though they were not as comfy as expected them to be; but overall they are very nice looking dress shoes to wear on special occasions..."
2,Lack of accuracy,"As previously mentioned, the language of the scrolls is annoyingly modern; the reference to the Holy Spirit as ""whoever He was because no one was ever sure"" made me want to stop reading right then; and a BIG innaccuracy is that in the book satan calls the fallen angels demons. The problem is - fallen angels and demons are two different things. Demons didn't come into existence until the nephanlim. and these problems are only in the first quarter of the book. I'm supposed to be reading this for a book club... not sure I can make it through.."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Loved the idea of the demon perspective of things. The premise that there were hidden scrolls to be deciphered added a mystery element to it. So I was very excited to read this book and was anticipating buying the rest of the set. Unfortunately as I delved into the book I found it to be really boring. I didn't care about the demon or what he was going through because the writing was so bad. Once Samantha Yale receives the scrolls and starts to read them it never cuts back to her. The writing of the scrolls is childish and hardly what one would expect in a written format. I found myself putting the book down for days at a time and only picking it up for a few pages at a time. I so badly wanted to like the story but ended up stopping about 2/3 of the way through. I'll take it to my local used book shop to see if they want it.If you liked the idea of the story, I recommendDemon: A Memoirby Tosca Lee. That's a story in a similar vein and is very well written and engaging."
3,Not sure what to think.,"Lucifer's Flood has many good points. It's an interesting take on Genesis. Problems arise, though, when the author writes that God probably wasn't sure how complicated human women could be (What about God's perfect knowledge?) since there were no women in Heaven, that everything there was male. Now, the Bible states that femaleness has always been part of God. I'm afraid this author has been deceived by some false teachings in her past."
1,Horrible Theology,"I understand this is a work of fiction but there are numerous points that BLATANTLY contradict the Bible. I expected the author to take some liberties elaborating the creation story where the Bible doesn't, but that was not the case. It is clear that the author does not believe that the Bible is the INFALLIBLE Word of God. She suggests through her writings that the story and timeline of creation did not go exactly as the Bible says. The danger of reading this book is that if you are not strong in your faith, her story (though portrayed as fiction) can seem like a possibility to the reader.And besides all of that... it was poorly written."
3,Good but....,"Overall the book was pretty good and fairly interesting, but because it was told almost entirely in the 3rd person, or from a narrative viewpoint, I found it a little slow and boring at times. I love biblically based science fiction, but this one I didn't care for too much. I will not be buying the next one in the series."
4,Liked it better than Demon: A Memoir,"Takes The Gap Theory of Genisis and fleshes out the supposed millions of years gapped between Genisis 1 and 2. A satisfying fulfillment of being the fly on the wall, almost felt as if I were discovering secrets from the other side. Very nice read and at times almost insightful if it wasn't pure speculation. Loved it."
2,Not what I expected,"The main character ""Trouble"" was a little scary at first. My 4 year old neice sat up straight when he appeared and looked at me and said, "" that is not a monster"". She was trying to convince herself of that. I am not impressed with this video. There are better ones out there."
5,My toddler loves it,"I first saw the video and I was cautioned about the suspense of the film. The face of the alien is ugly. But My 3 years old daughter is in love with him. Actually she is in love with ""trouble"" the alien. The way the film explains the risks to little ones is very effective. Also I was surprised because the company sent me the product the next day. My best experience shopping on line."
5,practical lesssons,Excellent production and cast that brings solid safety lessons to the age group for which it was intended. A good vidual tool for all parents with preschoolers.
1,unhappy customer / viewer,As a concerned parent I was not happy with this video. I was hoping it would be as good as the Stranger Safety video I ordered a few months ago. The scene with the ball going onto the street was just like a scary/thriller movie. It went too far. My 4yr old was frightened. For at lease 20 min. of this movie she hid behind a pillow yet watched it becasue I was there and yes I did offer to turn it off but she insisted on seeing if the blue character learned from his mistake(s). A learning video I believe should be both educational and fun not frightening. The blue character was a bit odd and the frig food scene was not pleasant. The only good scene was the silly lotion display and the pool safety rules. Although the intentions of those who created the DVD were probably good the outcome in my opinion along with a friend (who is a teacher) agree that it was not good. I do not recomend this dvd.
2,Ciao,"Unfortunately the CD does not seem to follow the text. Presentations on the CD are very limited and do not provide good practice for students. The Berlitz CDs are much better.The book is very expensive for a language text. In updating the text through sequential editions, the authors have added very little to the topic, but have changed the pagination sufficiently to make it necessary for students to buy the latest edition. Thus increasing the cost for students without any significant improvements in the material.In some places there are vignettes in Italian with no translation provided. Since some of the expressions are not in the vocabulary, this makes it difficult to understand, for example ""Informazioni"", page 86 in the 5th edition."
5,happy,I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is exactly what I thought I was getting. It was in a condition approriate to its description
5,What a help!,This workbook as tremendously helpful in supplementing the work from the textbook and classroom exercises. It brought together all the activities and lessons as an additional reinforcement. I would definitely recommend purchasing this workbook/lab manual.
4,Adorable,"I give this 4 stars because at times it is too hard for the suggested age group. Also, I had to reset my graphics accelerator according to Disney's Customer Support page which no child should be doing. I needed the hints to start level 4 and found the cave to get the ""missing"" honey pots. I liked the game enough to keep trying to find out why it wouldn't play and was not disappointed with the end results. Sadly, I am an adult learning to play computer games."
3,Book Travelers' Tales Prague and the Czech Republic,I was not necessarily impressed with these stories. I had hoped to read stories that would help me get more familiar with sites in Prague. A few of the stories fulfilled this interest but most of them did not.
4,Good pre-trip read,"Gave to our daughter for her upcoming trip to Prague. She likes more than a ""go here, see this"" guidebook and this one seems to fit the bill nicely. More depth given to the traveler's experience."
3,"Nice, but not true to Austen's style","While I admit I did not notice the switch-over, it was clear by mid-story that this is not the same style (though perhaps the same language) as Austen. It's an okay story, but the authoress seems more like she's uses Austen-esque phrases and words to mask her writing.I recommend it if you simply must devour another Austen novel, but not if you want a true work of her own."
5,Compaq computers seem to be the best buy for your buck!,"In my opinion and from what I've heard from customers Compaq seems to be more stable and has a good web site for supporting their customers and older computers (they have a huge web site).From the DeskPro 4000 and later is the best buy for speed and hardware upgrades. I personally own a DP2000, a DP4000 and a few DP EN models and also an obsolete all-in-one Presario CDS 524. I've heard alot people who own Dell computers are mad because of the unstability and support.I am an Apple fanatic you might say, the above is my partial opinion of PC's."
1,wrong knife,This product was not the product described on Amazon. It came as the next size larger than advertised. I am having a lot of trougle trying to return it. My computer will not print the return label and I have been waiting for two weeks for Amazon to send me a label as they promised. If it had been the right size knive [3.25 inches instead of 3.50 inches] it is one of the most useful and best pocket knives I have ever owned. Just be sure it is the small tinker[3.25 inches or 84mm] and it is perfect.
4,Great gift,"Gave this to my son as a ""coming of age"" Christmas gift. I explained the safety precautions and made sure he understood my expectations. He was very excited and loves his new knife. Swiss Army has always made wonderful knives. Good quality and will last forever, if taken care of properly."
5,Just what I wanted,"Great little knife. Small enough to carry in my pocket all the time. Very useful for opening packages and cutting string or thread, etc."
2,very expensive bracket,"Not exactly thrilled with an item which cannot be installed per instructions. The nylon attach mechanisim was so thick I had to redrill the metal portion and attach it with additional screws. Now I have several pieces of nylon cluttering my garage. Had I tried to install the included nylon fittings the airconditioner would have been 2"" off the lower sill. Make your own bracket."
5,Perfect fit,I purchased the Heavy Duty Window Unit Support Kit after my super informed me that my air conditioner was installed incorrectly. The kit was easy to use and did the trick. My window unit is installed correctly and I do not have to worry about it falling out the window.
4,Worked great,"Easy to install, supported the air conditioner unit perfectly and works well to this day. Recommend it for quick installs."
1,Nice idea but doesn't fit a lot of apartments,"This device is NOT universal.I live in a pre-war apartment building in Manhattan. The facade is brick with drip edges around the windows - very common. This product basically does not work with this kind of wall. I bought the small one, based on the the size of our a/c unit, but the bracket was way too short and did not extend out far enough for the support arm to reach the outside wall. So I bought the larger one, which was designed for A/Cs much bigger than ours, and has a longer bracket but still it did not fit the wall. The only way I managed to get it to work was by using the longer bracket but with the support arm from the smaller one. It still is not that great but it is better than nothing. And for a grand total of over $80.. 1/3 of the cost of the a/c itself!My advice is try to check if it works on your building. It is not easy to tell until you get it home and try to install it."
3,Not really universal,"this thing is designed for a window that has a window ledge...mine doesn't, so this became very useless for me right when I opened it up and TRIED to use it...very nice paper weight though...if you get this, make sure you have like 4 inches of ledge or this will also become very useless to you too...the one that came with the A/C unit I bought works better then this does....that one is really universal...wait to buy something like this unless you KNOW you need it....other then that I couldn't use it...it would have work perfictly if I did in fact have a ledge like it was designed for :)"
1,Does NOT work with 6000 BTU Frigidaire!,"I ordered this because Amazon advertised that customers who ordered the Frigidaire also ordered the bracket and insulation; Neither are needed for the 6000 BTU Model FRA065AT7. In fact, because the AC unit does not have a flat bottom, the bracket causes the AC unit to tilt in the wrong direction (toward the window) so that the unit cannot drain the condensate correctly. There is just no way for this bracket to be used with this AC. I am returning the bracket; The AC is small enough that it can easily be supported by a 20"" piece of 1x2 across the sill between window & storm window frame."
2,Doesn't Fit...!,"This is a great idea, but in function it just doesn't work.It's not a universal item.We have a drip edge outside our window on a brick house.The drip edge extends too far out for this to brace against.The drip edge (1 brick thick) is too thick for this to brace against the wall underneath.I thought this would look neat and professional, but I ended up doing what I've always done: Built a simple bracket from a 2x4.A lot cheaper and in the end faster & easier to set up."
3,Measure before purchase,"I gave this three stars because I can't really rate the product due to being unable to install since the building design doesn't match what this AC support needs.This product might be kind of a mystery as to how it will install with your building, so check the manufacturer's website to clear up some questions. Make sure to measure how thick your wall where the AC is installed from window to how ever far out the ledge ends. This support only works for 4-11 inches from window to end of ledge according to manufacturer's website. Can't comments on the too thin install but I ran into ledge that goes too far out. Can't install since support arm with rubber foot can't contact wall. Would work placing a block between ledge and the support AC unit rests on. That would at least take weight off my window frame but really 2 blocks would do the same thing.Study these pages before purchase.[...][...][...]"
3,"Best VOY book ever? You're kidding, right? Right?","Not a bad offering overall, but whoever says this is the *best* Voyager book ever written obviously hasn't read too many! Unlike someone else, I enjoyed the planet's political situation. But I got *very, very, quite, extremely bored* when reading about the Doctor's ""illness."" It seemed like half the book was Kes and Harry standing in front of a computer in sickbay, trying to figure out what was causing his condition. Come *on*--they exchanged medical jargon like two dueling dictionaries. If you read this one, do it to see Captain Janeway and B'Elanna Torres as helpless hostages--an interesting position for those two characters, especially--NOT to see the Holodoc get sick."
3,It was okay.,"This book was okay. Parts of it were very boring, parts of it were sort of interesting, but it was filled with errors. First of all, the EMH's name is NOT Zimmerman (as he is referred to basically all the time). If Susan Wright had actually seen a few episodes of Voyager, maybe she would have noticed this! Also, Janeway DOES NOT call her XO ""Number One."" It sounds as if Wright is a TNG fan, so why is she writing for Voyager?!?!The plot of this book was mediocre, and the characterizations were pretty bland. It was as if someone told her, Janeway is THIS type of person, and Tom is THAT type of person, etc. It didn't feel as if she really knew the people she was writing about. I hate that.This book could have been a lot better if it had been written by, say, Dean Wesley Smith & Kristine Kathryn Rusch, who are my favorite team of Voyager writers. They wrote my favorite Voyager book, Echoes, which I highly recommend in place of Violations because Echoes was SO MUCH BETTER."
2,Ok but not great,I tried reading this book like 3 times before I was finally able to get all the way through it. It wasn't the best Voyager book I've ever read either.
1,to much extraterrestrial politics,"I actually managed to read this book 'till the end. And the end (starting chapter 13, page 167) is really good. So was the beginning (chapter 1 p 1-18). But the pages in between, are a description of how Voyagers crew stumble around in the dark of a complex society which needs more than these couple of pages to be explained in. It's as if the author tried to make a civalization as politically interesting as Herbert's Dune, but with to little space to give it body, and of course with primary (Voyager) characters that have nothing to do with the society (but stumble around, trying several different non helpfull ways to deal with these politics which they don't understand either) If you haven't read all the other Voyager books, please read those others first. They are better (well mostly). For instance ""Echoes"" or ""Mosaic"" or ""Marooned"""
4,The way it should sound,"It's much clearer than this other brand of tape recorder I've tried. If you have enough clearity, no dust, then it will sound even more like it's bass-boosted. If your radio's that good. Clear enough when you listen to. I don't know about its breakability though."
3,Dancing quilts,"I was a little disappointed in the technique used in this book. It is a raw edge type of piecing, not what I like to see in a quilt. Probably will re-sell."
2,Very disappointing.,"I am a serious quilter and I have about 100 books on quilting. Dancing Quilts sounded like it would be different, lively, and creative. But I did not find it to be so. I was very disappointed. In fact, I will donate the book to some worthy cause."
3,I Like the First One Better!,"Sixteen year old Destiny Weller and her twin sister Livvy used to be very close, until Livvy chose to become a vampire. Now Destiny will do anything to get her sister back. But then Destiny realises that the only way to bring Livvy back is if Destiny becomes a vampire too!A good book. I liked the first one better. I really disliked the ending.--Scottie Schaeffer age 10"
4,It may not be the greatest literature but...,"The message of the book is to young, idealistic, egotistical, over-trained, under-educated, adrenaline and testosterone-soaked police, soldiers, and particularly special forces and mercenaries: You may be wiser when you are more experienced and you may have regrets. The desperate (the military especially and the police to a great extent are employers of last resort) are manipulated by the state and those who would be the state (war lords, cult leaders) and have been since the beginning of time.There is one scene of an unarmed old man who had enough of the murderous, young ronin and places him under citizen's arrest, only to be cut from the top of his head to his groin with one stroke and then calmly says, ""You're still under arrest"" the instant before he literally explodes in blood."
5,Gripping Through the End!,"From the moment I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. The way it is written keeps you driving to the end. Every perplexing event leads you forcefully into yet another. The writing in my opinion is perfectly done to convey a very surreal atmosphere. The message of the book is unexplainable, but reading the book brings understanding that can only be vaguely told through words.Don't be fooled; this story is authentic. Jennings has done an impeccable job of putting this story (told to him by Nyogen Senzaki) to text in such a gripping way. It is also very ""zen"" in how we find the stories of several seemingly unrelated people come together in such an important way.Loved this book, highly recommend it to anyone, Zen practitioner or not."
5,Got Excellent Information From this Book!,"This book gave me a lot to think about. Terrorism is devestating and reminds me of events I read in a recent book called ""Revelations: The Years 2000"" by Janet Markey. Both books makes you realize how fragil live really is and the importance of knowing that we don't know what may happen at any given time. We should treasure life, pray, and make sure our lives are in order. I know I will!"
1,Frist is no expert on bioterrorism.,"Bill Frist may be the Senate's only doctor, but he's no expert on bioterrorism. His opportunism in the wake of a serious tragedy is appalling. I know some of the Senate staffers who were exposed to anthrax, and many of the things he wrote in the book - and said at the time - simply aren't true. For example, Frist claims that Daschle staffers called his office for advice the day their letter was opened. Untrue. Frist was also known to have said after the death of Robert Stevens in Florida that there would never be another death from inhalation anthrax in America. Wrong - there were four more within a few weeks, and there might have been even more if some had not taken additional antibiotics and/or the anthrax vaccine (something Frist irresponsibly advised against). Frist loves to portray himself as the expert on all things medical, but he lacks the expertise to write this shallow, self-serving book, and he lacks the integrity to tell the truth."
2,false security,"I have worked in the field of Bioterrorism for 2 years now. I personally feel that books like this pose a certain danger. There is no quick fix for most types of bioterror, in the same way that duck and cover is no kind of real response to a nuclear blast. There is no real ""family guide"". The best protection is: 1. Establishing a good relationship with your family physician and 2. Preparing the standard disaster kit your family should own for the much more likely disasters- earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, etc.In a bioterror incident, it is your public health and medical systems that will protect you. Period. Make sure they are funded properly in your region."
1,Is He Serious?,"I don't have any more time to waste on this book. It was painfully obvious what his agenda was for writing it, it definitely wasn't to inform or entertain."
1,John Wayne,"This was a disappointing, boring read. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I suppose I'll let it collect dust in my basement."
3,More than I knew before,Well having zero knowledge to start with I guess this book enlightened me. I'm more of the creative type but still was able to learn from this book.
4,not the best,"This wasn't the best SVJH book I've read, but it was a fun read. ""Wild Child"" is about how blossoming actress Larissa Harris auditions for the school musical, ""West Side Story"", but is not accepted because she doesn't have a C average or higher, which is required to be eligible to be part of the play. She is crushed for a few days and pretty much ignores her drama club friends, Toby and Anna---and when she does talk to them, is not as open and friendly as she had been before. Larissa finally agrees to let Anna tutor her when she finds out that the girl who won the lead role Larissa wanted so badly, Bianca, also had slipping grades and was being tutored. I thought Larissa was being a stuck-up brat because she was so stubborn to accept that she needed help in her schoolwork. Read this if you like, but it isn't on my highly-recommended list."
4,A good book,"When they first introduced Larisa, I thought, ""Who cares?"" but this book focused on her, and now she's one of my favorite characters. If you would like to discuss these books, e-mail me at the above address."
4,REALLY GREAT FOR PEEPS WHO THINK THERE LIFE IS HARD!!!!!!,I read this book and it is soooooo goood. Larissa thinks everything is perfect untill the tryouts!!! Read it and find out what happenes!!
5,I Love It!,"Yipee! Another edition to the collection. I love sweet valley jr high! I'll give WILD CHILD 5 stars it super! but just a little suggestion, if you havent read any of the sweet valley jr high start with #1. It more exciting that way. haha!"
5,The best!,"This is one of the best CD's ever written. The songs are really easy to relate to, and there is just about a song for every emotion. Happiness: The Best Thing, Chained to You, Affirmation, The Animal Song. Sadness: Hold Me, You Can Still Be Free, Two Beds and a Coffee Machine, Crash and Burn, I Dont Know You Anymore. Anger: Gunning Down Romance. Embarassment: Crash and Burn. In Love: I Knew I Loved You, Chained To You, The Best Thing. Craziness: The Animal Song, Chained to You."
5,Success!,"Well, Daniel and Darren did it! They were their own hard act to follow and they pulled it off. ""Affirmation"" was well worth the wait. Daniel's melodies combined with Darren's sometimes haunting, sometimes frenetic, somtimes hopelessly romantic lyrics left this listener breathless and in tears at times. This cd ranks as one of my ""Top 10 CDs to Have If Ever Stranded On A Desert Island"". My congratulations to Daz and Daniel. This one's a keeper."
4,Savage Garden in full bloom,"I became addicted to Savage Garden after their first CD and eagerly awaited their next album.At first I was disappointed in Affirmation. All the songs seemed to blend together. But after I had listened to it a few times, each track stood out on its own and I fell in love with this CD too.Some songs tend to drag a little, a some are a little too saccharine, but over-all this album is wonderful! It all depends on your mood really. Affirmation speaks to the lonely little child in all of us.So do yourself a favor and buy this CD. I highly doubt you'll regret it."
5,Great Second Album,Savage Garden's second album is quite different from the first album in that it contains a lot more ballads. There are still some great songs with beat though. The song Affirmation has to be the best song I've heard in some time (and I listen to a LOT of music). Check this out if you are a fan of Savage Garden. If you're not a fan listen to it anyway and I promise you won't be disappointed!
5,An inspirational CD,"Savage Garden's songs are full of emotional and expressive thoughts, with the heart touching sense of innocence. The Australian duo's second album ""Affirmation"" surely has out done their first album. Their new approach shows a deeper meaning into their spirituality. This CD has an up lifting sense that relates to people's everyday problems. Every part of the song is injected with emotion and depth it gives faith and inspiration. The song ""You Can Still Be Free"" has a calming presence that promises an up healing motion and sense of great freedom. The title is something positive, affirming, and the declaration of assertion gives a feeling of affirmation to the listener. Giving the feeling of laughing or crying out loud, a great use of intuition by Darren Hayes the lead vocalist who puts his heart and soul into each song and melodies by Daniel Jones are none the less; the use of these patterns put this CD over the edge."
5,A Lovely Surprise,"Savage Garden is like a breath of fresh air--intelligent lyrics and an engaging sound. In an age of technology and interpersonal alienation, it's nice to hear music about real feelings and deep relationships, presented with sincerity and heart. Thank you, Australia, for offering up this very appetizing treat to jaded palates in America and elsewhere."
2,Just get the single...,"There is no doubt in my mind that Savage Garden has one of the best voices in today's pop scene. When I first heard ""I Knew I Loved You"", that song touched me in so many ways. I expected Affirmation not to be nearly as good as the single. It was WORSE than I thought. That is the only good song in the whole album, and in distant second is the title track. The rest of the songs are horrible, unless you like ""The Animal Song"". I would advise you not to get the album, but rather get the single. The two stars that I give are only for the single."
2,Its just about 'ok',"This cd has a few good songs but the majority doesnt quite hit any decent points. Not much depth to it, and they try for the whole teen-young adult crowd a little much. Ive listened to te cd a few times through and it just doesnt impress me. If theyd tried a new style or ANYTHING different then their first album...then maybe itd turned out better."
3,uummmmm??,Well to tell you the truth I pretty much bought this album because the guys were xtremly cute and I had a hard time deciding which one was cuter. So I went home and Listened to it. I hated it at first. Then it was the only thing I would listen to and it drove the family crazy. But after a while it got old and I have not picked it up since. Although if they had produced another album after this I probably would have bought it.Hope it helps.
1,....,"... it is the worst piece of music(if i can call it that) that ive ever heard. I heard the cd in a store and jeez.... I mean i will respect the artists and everything but this cd is very un original. The lyrics are the same that Nsync sings and the music is like any other Teeny Band. If u want some REAL music with depth, thought, and emotion try The Deftones, Korn, Fuel, Creed, Alice In Chains, DMX, Disturbed, or Incubus. Why dont they have O Stars!!!!!????!!!!!!"
2,YAAAAAWWWWWWWWWN! THIS CD IS A SLEEPER.,"I am sorry to say that Savage Garden whos debut selftitled CD was perfect pop, shows they have sold out to America's radio industry with ""Affirmation"".""I Knew I Loved You"" is just another watered down safe bet ballad....If songs like ""To the Moon & Back"" and ""Tears of Pearls"" were gigantic hits then this group would be putting out more true perfect pop....Instead ""Truly Madly Deeply"" was their #1 smash, and now they are coming out with carbon copies of that....for true, and safe chart success.I will roll up to this - by your self the 12 inch version of ""Truly Madly Deeply"" and save your self a few bucks and NOT buy ""Affirmation"".Though this CD is not bad, it is just middle of the road....Savage Garden you obviously sold out."
1,Contrived and Insipid,Savage Garden's new album is vapid and calculated. This album was made to pay their house notes. No artistic effort was put into this album. It's clearly corporate and pretentious.
4,"Overall, Pretty Good","Savage Garden is certainly an interesting group. They are a duo, with one singer and one musician. They write their own songs and have created their own style. Therefore, I don't think they should really be classified as a boy band. The upbeat songs are full of joy and excitement. Chained To You is probably one of the best on the CD. Affirmation and The Animal Song are also good songs. Crash And Burn is a beautiful slow/midtempo song. It has heartfelt lyrics, and was the perfect choice for the 2nd single. The 1st single, however, I Knew I Loved You is horrible. It was overplayed to the max on every mainstream radio station, and it wasn't a great song to begin with. Just another example of a cheesy pop ballad. Overall it's a very enjoyable CD with some soothing rhythms. But in closing: What exactly is the savage part in their name supposed to mean? There really isn't anything 'Savage' in this CD . . ."
5,Absolutely a MUST HAVE!!,"Savage Garden outdid their first album with this one. I just can't get enough of Darren's beautiful vocals and Daniel's fabulous guitar skills. Not to mention that both Darren and Daniel wrote all their songs!! The title track, ""Affirmation"", is my all time favorite song out there. And it's not like my music collection is limited (Garth Brooks, U2, Mozart, Tom Petty, Billy Joel, ect.) either! I went to their concert when they were in town and they blew me away with their showmanship, their energy, and their emotion. If you need a CD to cover great music, touching lyrics, and rousing rhythms.....this is your dream come true! (I know it is mine.)"
4,Passionate Sophmore Album!,"Savage Garden is an awesome group. I've liked them since they released their debut album. Even though I like their previous album a bit better, this one is still great. Affirmation has excellent hits such as Crash And Burn, Affirmation, I Knew I Loved You, and so many more. Darren, the lead singer, has an amazing voice. Daniels insturments add a melodic sound to the music. This album is more serious than their first, full of love songs, and heartbreakers. Overall, this is a great album and you should get it if you are a fan of the group."
3,My Savage Garden Review,"I bought this CD for the song ""I knew I loved you"", I love that song and the rest are ok, but there is no comparison to Backstreet Boys or 'N sync, they are the BEST and always will be!"
2,Not quite Savage...,"A Savage Garden fan after their fantastic debut album..I didnt hesitate before I bought this CD, also considering it had hits like ""I knew I loved you..."" , ""the animal song.."". HOWEVER..I was kinda disappointed with this album..sounds really watered down and needlessly mushy.Perhaps its their new producer(same as Micheal Bolton) ...the lyrics are nowhere close to the first album. Its one of those B side hits albums. The album kinda picks up towards the end with some better numbers...but all in all..was not quite ""savage"". Borrow it from a friend before you go buying it! I think its watered down..and lyrical content is low!"
3,Juvenile,"Savage Garden makes the dreaded transistion to teen-pop with this album. The lyrics are trully juvenile and lack poetic depth, but the arrangements are solid for pop music.. You'll like it if your 15 or younger."
1,dont bye this CD,"This is one of there worst CD's ever. They sing way to high, they sound like girls. Don't waste your money!"
1,4.7 STAR RATING??!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Everything about SG sucks. SG blows! Instead of this p.o.s., buy ""Hate Crew Deathroll"" by Children of Bodom!"
4,pretty good follow up CD,"Affirmation is a good follow up CD. It's really hard to make a CD better than their first. In an interview with them, Savage Garden said that they felt guilty that they didn't express their feelings enough in their first album. One would think after selling over eleven million records of their last album that they wouldn't change their format, but they did. Most artists don't care how their music sounds and just write what other people want to hear. Savage Garden is awesome for standing up for themselves and playing music that they can call their own. Because of this, their CD is a little softer than the other, but is still really good. Crash and Burn, The Animal Song, You Can Still be Free, and Gunning Down a Romance are my favorite songs. I Knew I Loved You is pretty good too, and spent at least a month at number one on both the adult conteporary charts and the pop charts. Buy this and their first self-titled album."
5,savage garden affirmation,"its not often that you come across a cd where every single song is brilliant and you would be unhappy about missing even one of them, but this album by these two talented, brilliant men, darren hayes and daniel jones, makes the grade perfectly. particularly excellent is the haunting song ""You Can Still Be Free"", a touching tribute to a friend. ther is also ""Gunning Down A Romance"" a intense number with a little more edge to it. there is also the gorgeous song ""I Don't Know You Anymore"" which is just simple, just Darren's voice and a piano, with no over the top vocal gymnastics, but portrays such emotion that you feel strange speaking after its been played for fear of breaking the moment that it creates. the songs are excellent, darren's unique voice is breath-taking, every element of this cd is just spectacular. every song will keep you captivated and make you want to listen to this fantastic cd over and over again. a must have for all music fans!Zoe Cox"
3,they could do much better,"When I first listened to ""I knew I loved you"", which is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, I coul'd not wait to get the album. But now I must say that I'm a little dissappointed by this. The very best song on the album is ""I knew I loved you"", also ""Two beds and a Coffee machine"" and ""I don't know you anymore"" are quite good. But the rest...these are popsongs which nearly sound all the same, despite the texts, cause they are sometimes really touching. This is not a bad album, I think you just have to get used to it, but, nevertheless, their first one was soooooo much better....! I would give their fist album ten stars, if that was possible!"
4,Savage Garden's sophmore release is better than the first,"Darren Hayes' voice just gets better everytime I hear it. The opening and title track ""Affirmation"" is enough to buy this great album. The lyrics are very true to life and all about relationships. Mostly genderless relationshipd which personally I prefer. No doubt that ""I Knew I Loved You"" will become the new song for wedding couple of all sexes and ""Chained To You"" will be a big club hit. There are a few ""yawners"" towards the end so i wouldn't give it 5 stars. However, if you liked their self titled album, I bet you'll really dig ""Affirmation."""
5,Quite an Affirmation,"This CD is amazing, now it doesnt have the same sound as their debut albumn but it is in no way disapointing, they really put alot of thought in this album and it seems that they wanted to tackle some issues different from earlier this cd is about love and things that go on around it and its worth the money, you'll never hear sounds like this on other albums."
4,No monotony in this melody.....,"When I bought the album, I knew it was going to be good, and I wasn't disappointed. The lyrics touch your heart, the music is amazing, and they have voices to die for. A fabulous follow-on to 'Savage Garden'!"
5,Even better than the first!,"I love this CD - I think Savage Garden has gotten even better with this second CD than their first attempt. Their music is so meaningful and melodic - very well written. I could listen (and have listened) to this over and over again without getting tired of it. Also very easy to sing along with. If you like to sing and you liked the first Savage Garden CD, you'll love this one!"
4,Strength in Lyrics,I thought that the song Crash and Burn had alot of meaning and strength in it. It really lifts one up when they are down. It made me feel enlightened when I first heard it. I was going through a real tough time in my life and this song really helped me get through it. Whenever I need to relax I play this cd. It makes me feel good on the inside. I really recommend this CD to anyone who needs their spirit lifted. All the songs are great and they all hold some deeper meaning.
5,A wonderful album,"This is among the best cds i own. Each song expresses an emotion. In Crash and Burn, it shows that you always have someone to support you if you feel down. I Knew I Loved You is the romance anthem of the new millenium. Affirmation teaches about 25 lessons all in one great song. The Animal Song expresses a feeling we all get sometimes: the craving to live like animals and be free to do whatever we want. Overall, I reccomend this to anyone who likes great music."
3,Not as good as the original!,"I think this cd is good but not as good as their first cd. I like the songs Affirmation, I Knew I Loved You, The Best Thing, Animal Song, and You Can Be Free, but the cd is still too mushy. The songs on the first cd like To the Moon & Back, I Want You, Truely Madly Deeply,Tears of Pearls and Carry on Dancing were cooler."
2,"Sorry, no cigar...","Actually... The lyrics and songwriting here aren't bad. They aren't bad at all.Fact remains I don't think his voice is soulful enough to lift this music up to appropriate heights. He sings ""correctly"". It's musically ""right"". He's not off-key. It's just... flat. You want my standard for empathic and soulful singing: listen to Otis Redding's ""These arms of mine"" and then listen to this. You'll see what I mean by ""flat"".Also I hear: drumcomputers, synths and I suspect even the guitar sounds that pop up here and there come from a keyboard. Where are the instruments?Put these songs into the hands of a better vocalist and add a real band (not a band in a box) and you'll come up with a much better album."
2,"Geez, what's with all the 5 stars?","People, people, please! Are your lives so on edge that you can be so uncritically accepting of this musical version of prozac? Sure these guys have okay singing voices, but that's about it. The lyrics here are more or less at the Hallmark card level of profundity, the melodies are unoriginal, and the production is slick, glossy, and bothersome. All in all, this is nothing more than an occasionally pretty bundle of schlock."
2,Not a patch,"Savage Garden's follow-up to the brilliant debut album is disappointing. The sound is very commercial and is the type of album that will become very dated in years to come. The title track 'Affirmation' is a good example of this as well as 'Animal Song'. America seems to love this band, but once you've heard our newest group 'Killing Heidi' you'll wonder why you fussed over this group."
2,Not their best work,"Savage Garden return. AFFIRMATION is not their best work. I was surprised at how much whining Darren did on this album. AFFIRMATION begins with the in your face ""affirmation"", where Darren runs down his list of ""beliefs"" over a synth dance beat. There's sort of an annoying quality to that song. The rest of the album isn't that much better either. The only song that struck me as truly great was the hit ""I knew I loved you"". That ballad is so light and dreamy, it just makes you feel good. The rest of AFFIRMATION deals with the heartbreak of getting over an ex. The mood is not the reason that this album is kind of dud, it's the delivery. The beats are pretty basic and it sounds like it could've all come from a casio keyboard. AFFIRMATION tries too hard with not enough steam behind it."
5,"good cd, beautiful lyrics","I was a bit hesitant about by this cd after hearing ""The Animal Song"" which, though a great deal of fun, I thought was not up to caliber with ""Truly Madly Deeply"" and ""To the Moon and Back"". I bought it anyway, and don't regret it. This album is full of very beautiful lyrics and music. The second half of the cd is very sad and touching. I highly recommend this cd, especially if you are already a Savage Garden fan."
5,Awesome,This is one of the best Albums I have heard in a long time. A lot of work went into the lyrics and melodies. I can't wait for the next album.
5,Awesome! Perfect! Just Beautiful!,"We can only give five stars? At first, I bought this CD for I Knew I Loved You, but after listening to it, I have to say it is truly awesome. I Knew I Loved You is the best song! It is for those people who are in love with someone."
5,"So achingly sad, it's beautiful","This album explores all the pain and sadness one can feel after a breakup, or loss of any kind. Darren Hayes' voice can literally move you to tears, or instantly make you smile. Daniel Jones' background music, is astounding. For anyone who dismisses these guys as only balladeers, give the entire cd a listen. The songs range from despair, to teasingly fun, to looking forward to the future.I love every song, that I can't give just one or two that are particularly perfect. They are all perfect. They all touch your heart and soul. What a talented duo."
5,Sooooooo Good!,"Those guys are so grat, I mean their first album was great but this one is excellent. I love every single song on this album!"
4,Up tempo,Enjoyed this album more then their previous one. I am very happy with my buy and play the album often. It has many catchy tunes. I would describe the album as up tempo.
5,"excellent variety, good buy","I've always been impressed by the variety of music that comes from Savage Garden. At least based on their radio singles, every song has a unique feel to it, and were it not for Darren's standout voice, one might even think each song was performed by completely different bands. The same cannot be said for this entire CD, but there is still a nice mix of upbeat and slower songs. I always think it's a big plus when a band writes their own songs, and none of these appear to have suffered from the pitfalls of trying too hard to rhyme in the right place, and many of them really do inspire you to think a little. Or at least ponder just about everything in life (i.e. the song, Affirmations). One other note...don't be fooled by the apparent ""boy band"" style in I Knew I Loved You. While I personally think this is still leagues above any boy band song, it's got the same kind of feel to it, and it's really not typical of any of their other songs."
5,A++ for originality and musical craftsmanship,"...a truly wonderful CD by two very talented artists. I love the songs they personally wrote for this CD. I applaud all artists like these two who make this type of commitment to originality and musical craftsmanship! Great to get away from the canned formula music dominating the airwaves these days. Hard to top Truly Madly Deeply from their previous CD (my personal favorite) but this CD was not disappointing. Two Beds and a Coffee Machine and I Don't Know You Anymore are very beautifully written slower songs. Includes popular songs: Affirmation, Crash and Burn, with the rest of the songs keeping up with their high level of talent!"
5,Pure Magic!,"This is my absolute favorite CD in my collection! All the songs are simpley marvelous, including the one sthey haven't released, such as ""Affirmation""""Chained TO You"" and especially ""Gunning Down Romance"". If you have their first album, you HAVE to get this one!"
5,"""The Best Thing""","I bought this CD because I have always liked the songs that they had released and had been on the radio. I knew that I would love this CD. One of the other reasons why I chose to buy the CD was because my brother has one of their other CDs. I really enjoyed the other CD and so I decided to buy it. I will enjoy it forever! I especially liked the ""Crash and Burn"" and ""The Animal Song"". They both had great lyrics and meaning. All of the songs lyrics are beautifully written."
2,"Not bad, but not great","I spend around two hours a day in the gym, and they have looped this CD on the sound system day in and day out for two weeks. I must admit the album has its moments (some of the ballads are kind of touching), but I find it's also chock full of super-cheezy cliches and silly lines (primarily found in the ""Animal Song""). Many of the songs are in the same key and use the same chordal structures (almost a'la Britney Spears). Also, the lead singer uses an irritating switch to falsetto, which gets old real fast. These little annoyances are making me want to start working out with earplugs in. Two stars for effort."
2,Mild just like the Menace Phantom,"I have to admit I had really liked their debut album, some of the songs were really cool (even though I want you strangely sounded like Roxette's Joyride...) As for affirmation, I'm sorry to say that it wasn't the CD I expected... They lost something on their way...My opinion."
4,Excellent cultural source!,"I'm using this book in an independent study class to help bolster my French prior to entering an art history doctorial program. Both my instructor and I love the cultural content and find the lessons to be quite engaging. The text really does take one beyond what one has learned in a traditionally taught language course. As such, grammar, sentence construction, conjugation and the definition of words is not the focus of this text, but I guarantee you will gain a greater understanding of how the French speak and write."
1,Next!,"I see why all the reviewers before me were upset with the wrong person being credited with a song. I have a similar 70's set by MADACY(remember that name so you can avoid anything by them) and was equally perplexed as to why most songs were credited with only one person from the band that did them and why some songs sounded different. I asked a good friend who knows a lot about music(about 4,000 cds). He told me MADACY is a company that puts out a lot of these kinds of compilations and for whatever reason get one member of the original band to do a new version. Move on to the ""Have a Nice Day"" series if you want the real thing."
1,Wassup with this set?,"Who is Brian Connelly? Wasn't Ballroom Blitz sung by Sweet? If you can't get the artist and title correct, who wants to buy this set of CD's?"
1,Who is Jerry?,Green-Eyed Lady was sung by Sugarloaf (maybe Jerry was part of that group). What gives?
3,Not for Youth Coaches,I ordered this book hoping to get a little more insight oncoaching youth players ( 7 to 12 ). This book was a little toin depth for younger players. Would be a great book for H.S. orCollege coaches and players.
3,Other Books,"As the title says, this is a position by position breakdown of useful things to practice and learn for the game of American Football. With an emphasis on the younger player or hack beginner type it isn't too bad a book to have a look at for erstwhile players and coaches to gain a better understanding of some simple fundamentals."
5,The Most Thorough Position Book - A Must Have !!!,"Once you look at the table of contents you will see that this book is complete. Every position, a ton of variable technique, and information on personal adjustments.As a youth coach of over 10 years, I feel I may be better prepared to break down the game than I have ever been. Some stratagies are discussed, but mostly this book will enhance your fundamental football knowledge like no book ever written. Get it today, I am certain that you won't be sorry.Coach TottenPSA Football -Lebanon, OR"
4,Super book for junior coaches,"Tom Bass does a great job in keeping this book simple for junior level coaches. It covers most every aspect of football coaching for youth. The only negative is the age of the book, which degraded my score from 5 to 4 stars. I would immediately purchase an updated book - if it becomes available someday."
5,Smart,It is smart to protect your eyes in any work situation. These are also comfortable to wear and do the job.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Maybe some of you have received these Made in China sun/safety glasses that work. I Did Not! The distortion in both the supposed clear area and the magnified area made them completely useless. They honored the return, but the return shipping cost made it kind of a waste of time and money, but I did return them. If you purchase I wish you better luck."
2,NO ERAN LO QUE ESPERABA,"LA CONSTRUCCION SE MIRA DE BUENA CALIDAD,PERO NO SON PARA EL SOL,YA QUE TIENEN AUMENTO EN LA PARTE,DE ABAJO,SON COMO PARA UN TALLER DE SOLDADURA,O EN ESMERILES"
5,For Big Heads,"OK, I admit it, I'm a blockhead. I have a big head and a square face. Most sunglasses off the rack look ridiculously too small on me. Not these Apex bi-focal safety shades. They fit my face just right. Also, the straight temples make them easy to put on and off when wearing my full-face motorcycle helmet. Comfortable nose piece, and they stay in place. What a great find! Sure is nice getting this kind of eye protection, only paying $13 so I can buy several, and finally being able to read the little tiny symbols and words on my GPS and motorcycle instrument panel."
4,Functional,"I wore Peppers (brand) for years, but they were no longer available at REI. So I ordered these and did not expect much, being they are not expensive. And they work great for biking, hiking, etc. They allow me to read my Garmin easily as I exercise. My nose is broad, but the glasses fit fine."
4,Great for the money,"These glasses are great for driving and reading in the sun, but the bifocal line is too low for working at eye level or above your head (I work construction in the AZ sun). Otherwise, the're built well, seem to be quite scratch resistant, good eye protection and far less expensive than others that I've looked at."
2,Very disappointed,"I use sunglasses on a daily basis , I have been using a different brand for years and they were discontinued so I ordered the apex glasses with high expectations but after the third day of wearing them the frames broke on the right side , and I was able to repair them , then the very next day the left side of the frames broke leaving them unrepairable....I was very disappointed...save your money !!!!"
2,Not pleased!,Hoping that the glasses would be great for outdoors they were so uncomfortable. The plastic was unforgiving....When wearing them they simply did not sit correctly on my face. Will not order glasses on line again.
2,Okay glasses but magnifying lenses too close together.,"These glasses are a very nice fit and very stylish, but when I use the magnifying lenses I feel like I'm crossing my eyes. I only use these when I absolutely have to. I also bought a pair of Dewalt's and they are excellent."
4,Good reader,Reader has a nice snug fit and I like the wrap around glasses. Nice for reading at the beach or keeping score at a baseball game.
5,Love 'em,I love these glasses. Great for driving when I also have to read a map or some other printed material. Haven't tried them for leisurely reading outside on a sunny day yet. But I expect they will be good for that as well.
4,"Great item, but...","Great item but they seem a bit fragile. I need bifocal sunglasses sometimes and these work great in that regard, and the wrap-around nature protects my eyes against UV and glare, but the arms seem fragile when I open them to put on the glasses. Maybe they are just very flexible, but we'll see..."
1,Horrible Live performance,This has to be one of THE worst live performances I have ever heard. The background singers in particular are just ghastly....oversinging and WAY off key!!! Plus there is just way too much use of the F word. Audience even seems disgusted or bored. Worst live recording ever.
2,Dated 70's soft-core,"To be honest, I purchased this dvd because of the numerous positive reviews I read on the web. I was very disappointed. It is very ""70's"" looking (and sounding) and has little value as a supposedly erotic film. Outside of a few visually interesting scenes (i.e. an older (ugly) guy and a young (very attractive) woman rolling around on a floor covered with what looks like giant pages out of a dictionary, with definitions of sexually oriented terms). Most of the film came off as pretentious, boring, and outdated. I have seen one other Metzger film to date, ""Therese and Isabel"", and that one was slightly superior."
3,Classic 70's movie,"Watch it as a ""regular"" movie as the sex scenes aren't really TOP! But the movie itself is quite nice, some nice avant guard movie making (being the 70's), the story is not bad, nice parallel stories and flashbacks...Worth watching, but don't expect to be ""horny as hell"" after...."
2,clever rather than erotic,"I was new to this director, already known for a repertoire of naughty pictures. The idea as expressed by reviewers made the plot feel like one that was ripe for erotic situations. However the director was so preoccupied with engineering his clever plot twist, which i wont spoil here, that the story is quite bland and the chemistry between the actors very flat. An opportunity missed."
5,Amazing !!,"It's amazing album i've ever had !! I was big fans of NKOTB and this songs in this album remind me all what've happened in many years ago when NKOTB was king of the first Boy band. I love I'll be loving You Forever, its cool song!! You would be upset if you didnt get this album, so complete!! Now iam 27 years old and still miss NKOTB and love them. Just get this album, you would be satisfied...."
5,Blast from the past...,"Shipped quickly, received quickly, What else is there to say about NKOTB? I loved them as a pre-teen and teen... it was just a blast from the past for me."
4,Guilty!,"Now this is what I call a guilty pleasure. With its shiny guitars, roaring vocals and stadium-ready melodies, this is the kind of stuff that indie rock was created as a rebellion against. But I stand by my judgement of Ideas Above Our Station as a damn good rock album, entirely unassuming, unpretentious and crucially exciting. Like At the Drive-In with all the rough edges sanded down, Hundred Reasons make a poppy, enjoyable rawk sound which anyone is encouraged to (secretly) check out."
2,pretty boring!,i think the vocals are good but the songs are not so great! the lyrics could be better! they play instruments quite well! silver is the best song!
1,Oh my goodness what a shocker!!,"I cannot for the life of me understand why people are giving this film more than 1 star. It is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen! Why a stellar cast such as this would come on board this project is beyond me, and how such a great director (or so I thought) managed to make such a bad film is only explained by the woeful script. It's a stinker. Really. PS - and what's with Garry Shandling? Who thought it was a good idea to cast him in a leading role?"
3,Remake not as good as original,"This is a remake of the 1962 movie, Visitor From A Small Planet, starring Jerry Lewis which won Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival. I thought Lewis did a better job as the space alien who is beamed on board a commercial airliner."
2,A waste.,"I think that the film flounders just because it was made in a haste. It's definitely half-baked. It jumps and jitters from one track to another quite unexpectedly. The fact that there are some good jokes told by good actors only adds to the overall confusion.If given the time to shape inside the director's and scriptwriters' heads that movie could be one of the funniest offerings of the year. Instead in just stumbles to the ridiculous and utterly unfunny finale.Annette Bening is the ex-alcoholic of Mars Attacks! and the realtor of American Beauty. Linda Fiorentino is her usual maneating self. No surprises here. And Garry Shandling's face looks paralyzed.Just as the movie's baby, the film was born much earlier than it was due."
1,What Planet Is This Movie Funny On?,"I cannot recall a movie in which more talented people, folks who have done such great work in front of and behind the camera, have all failed so miserably. There is not one laugh in this movie. And the story itself is inane to the point of utter tedium. Garry Shandling had better come up with a vehicle that suits his talents very, very soon. A leading man he ain't. Even if Adam Sandler cranks out three movies this year and they spin off a few SNL characters into feature films, you'll be hard pressed to find a worse comedy this year."
1,don't bother,what a waster of my time...the whole movie is so predictable and boring. i've spent better time in the can than watching this movie.
5,Great Movie,"If you are a Gary Shandling fan, this movie is a must. If you like subtle dry humor, this movie is a must. If you like movies, this movie is a must."
3,"Thank you sir, may I have another?","It's nice to hear something ""new"" from Erasure, but I'm ready for some original material, aren't you? Some nice arrangements, especially ""Ebb-Tide, and Solsbury Hill"", but not quite up to par with the likes of ""Abba-esque"". I won't say I'm disappointed, but I must admit, Erasure is better than this."
1,Wow. Yuck.,"I'm terribly disappointed. I don't know what else to say, really. The worst crime for me, with a band that I love, is to be BORING. I'm bored by this album. And, I just plain don't like half the songs to begin with, so why would I enjoy covers of them? I don't think their creativity has dried up, as some suggest. They just wanted to try something different. Now they should go back to an original studio album for their next attempt.If you are an Erasure fan, you should probably skip this one. I'm going to purchase ""Loveboat"" because I enjoy what I've heard of it so far.Go buy the single versions of ""Solsbury Hill"" (which of course if different ---and BETTER, more souped up--- than the album version) and ""Make Me Smile"" and skip the rest of the cd. Phooey!!!"
3,Could Be Better...,"Eh, so-so. Could definitely be better. Usually with Erasure, the remixes coming from the albums are dynamite and you should probably skip this and concentrate on those. Erasure's flair has always been in their own writings. Here, they just changed the tempo and added the synthesizers in an attempt to make it their own. Only three good tunes - numbers 1, 3, and 4."
3,"yes, they are other peoples songs!!!","I Have been a huge fan from their inception.I was less than ecstatic when first I heard this album. It has had some redeeming tries on it, but all in all I think I have always enjoyed the creative nature of Erasure most of all. I even like Love boat. It was a nice gentle stretch for them and I think it went over well. I was disappointed that it had not been released in America. I'm not sorry that I bought Other peoples songs, but I wish that they released some of there own stuff in America. I purchased tickets and airfare to spend the day to go to see them live next month, I hope they use little from this album."
5,More fun fun fun,"This is really a fun, upbeat and sometimes very lovely collection of strangely diverse cover songs. I'm not sure that any other band on the planet would have the wondrous audacity to include works by Peter Gabriel and Buddy Holly not to mention Elvis Presley and The Buggles (although the total computerized voice work on this last one threw me off). A highlight for me is the soothing ""Goodnight."" This collection is obviously Andy's indulgence and I think it's a nice counterpart to their self-titled Vince indulgence.Andy deserves it...and we reap the benefits through lots of entertaining listening sessions.Cannot wait to see it live!"
1,Avoid this,"I stumbled on this travesty while seeking a version of Video killed the radio star, and found the selection of songs intriguing. I love versions of good songs and erasure had chosen some excellent songs to cover.Unfortunately, their mechanical synthpop approach to this classic material is worse than annoying--it is slapdash and heretical. Particularly, their Solisbury Hill tackles one of the finest songs of the rock era and facemasks the profound meaning of Gabriel's original--one suspects the group didn't even understand the mystical meaning of the song! If an appropriate group of pop music mavens convened in a college and appointed a theologically correct pop music pope(is Paul McCartney available? He isn't doing anything except battling messy divorce cases.), he would excommunicate erasure and condemn them to the Muzak inferno.Just seek out the originals of these songs."
3,6 Good Songs,"I have mixed feelings about this one. Half the songs are great, the other half - mediocre at best. The problem, I think, is in the song selection. Even tech wiz V. Clarke and vocally gifted A. Bell can't keep me from picking up the remote and skipping over some of these songs. Best song here: ""Solsbury Hill""."
2,WHAT THE HELL IS ERASURE DOING?,"It surely breaks my heart that Erasure, who has the best male singer in the world, could make such an effortless piece of work. Solsbury hill is quite possibly the best cover tune ever but that is just about where it all stops. The rest of the album is just silly and boring. First of all, I'm not sure if Erasure's fan base is even familiar with the material they're covering on this album. Yeah, my Buddy Holly records are sandwiched right in between my erasure cds. But, this is how it is in erasureland these days. Up and down, up and down, and so on. Buy chorus. Buy the circus. Buy all the box sets of singles. Other people's songs is their worst effort ever."
2,Yet Another Disappointment - Don't Waste Your Money,"The art of a great cover is the selection -- the ability to retrieve a song from the graveyard at precisely the right time for ripe nostalgia. Erasure wins with the single, Solsbury Hill, but falls flat on its face with the rest. I can't think of a more annoying collection of songs than When Will I See You Again, Can't Help Falling in Love, and You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling. Gagggggg! Aside from perpetuating the poor judgement Andy Bell and Vince Clarke have shown since their last admirable effort, Chorus, the fact that they are performing 'Other People's Songs,' is verification of a continuing trend of writers block. These guys have sadly lost touch with the remarkable talent they possess."
2,Looking forward to another original,"Sorry guys, but, you're waaaay too good to be remaking other people's songs. Strange that I don't really like the originals of any of the songs either, so, perhaps I'm a bad judge for this CD. It's upbeat, but, the songs are just terrible. 'You've lost that lovin' feeling'....No! No! No! I'll just have to look forward to your next original release of new, new, new, new lyrics and music."
3,Eh?,"Solsbury Hill is really a great track/cover but truly, I would have rather spent a few dollars on the single rather than the entire album. Although, Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me) is an energetic little number - dare I say even better than Duran Duran's live cover! And Ebb Tide makes me want to flail around a well-lit stage in my best feather boa! I would have to agree with another user that many of the tracks on this release are pretty weak.Being a long time fan of Erasure, I have been disappointed with the last two releases - that's really hard to say! Any suggestions on how to hear this album differently? Maybe it just hasn't grown on me yet?"
2,TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA PARTY LIKE IT'S 1986!,"After the dreary misfire that was ""LOVEBOAT"" one should be happy that Erasure have returned to their roots. One should-until one realizes that it's 2003. There is not one synthesized beep or swoosh on any of these songs that we didn't hear on countless Erasure albums since the early 80's. Granted, they are taking ""Other People's Songs"" and making them their own, but in this case it's not really a good thing. Pointless, who asked for it? cover versions that can be done by anyone and merely come off as a filler laden vanity project by a band that sadly seems way past it's 1989 expiration date. Wake up, Rip Van Winkles-it's the 21st century. Even Bananrama and the Pet Shop Boys have managed to stay more current. A real tragedy that's for completists only and even though may only open it only once."
2,Oh More Lame,"As a long time Erasure fan I bought this the week it came out.Needless to say, I wish I didn't.Erasure cover songs are usually great - as seen by the Abbaesque album.But these songs all seem like they were banged off in a spare week of studio time because the boys needed some cash.All in all - I say skip it."
1,"The New, ""Steve & Edie""!","The only thing that kept running through my mind listening to this garbage was, ""How bored were they...really?"" Not only do I find this ""disc-CARDable,"" I discovered that it actually has an audio medicinal use...inducing vomitting! I used to be embarrassed for my parents when I would see them all ""a-glow"" watching/listening to ANY Steve Lawrence and Edie Gormet piece. I would feel the same for anyone feeling ""sentimental""...or feeling pretty much ANYTHING from this collection by Erasure. C'mon folks...are we so wiped out of any original ideas?"
3,"Light, but melodic and, oh, so catchy.","This will not become your favorite Erasure album, unless it's the only one you own. However, there are some great songs on here, especially their versions of ""Solsbury Hill,"" ""Make Me Smile,"" and ""Goodnight."" The other stuff may be less enjoyable but it's still fun to sing along to in the car, especially if you know the original versions; however, I can see younger fans not liking a lot of the tunes here. So put the best songs in your iPod and you're all set."
2,Ugh!,"Huge Erasure fan here... I was excited when this CD was released, especially after the abysmal ""Loveboat."" (Loveboat SHOULD have been good, with the addition of guitars and all but song choice was lacking.) Well, this didn't make up for that piss poor CD. I think ""Solsbury Hill"" kicks butt. awesome cover of an already great song. I think I like the album version of this song is best but the CD single is worth the $ because of the different mixes and a decent ""B side.""Other than that, this CD sucks. Sorry, Vince and Andy. Love you guys and I appreciate trying new things but I've been craving your return to form."
5,Very Good Covers cd.,"When this first came out I loved it. Then, I started reading some of the less than shining reviews and I sort of shelved it. But, then I started humming the songs at work and on the bus and I loved it, again. So much for the detracting views. This is good stuff. You will not hear these songs done this differently by anyone else. It is truly magnificent. Favorite cuts:Make Me Smile,Video Killed the Radio Star,You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',Solsbury Hill,Ebb Tide,When Will I See You Again,True Love Ways,Everyday...I've practically named all of the cuts. It's that good. Don't be dissuaded by the nervous nells. I think folks were spoilt by the great dance mixes from the other cd's...ie Abbaesque,River Deep,Moutain High, Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie A Man After Midnite...etc. Do more please.Please! thank you.jd"
2,...are best left unrecorded by Erasure,"This collection of poorly chosen and recorded songs really shouldn't have been released as a bona fide Erasure album. Save a track or two for b-sides to GOOD Erasure singles, but leave this glop in the dust. I will say that their versions of ""Come Up And See Me"" and ""Ebb Tide"" managed to win me over, but the rest is just awful. Here's hoping Erasure never attempt to release anything like this ever again."
2,"Sorry Girlz, not one of your best Albums","Not too sure what they were thinking, but this album is by far the worse one they have released. I was really looking forward to this release, but was really disappointed when I listened to it. It would be like Dolly Parton releasing a rap singles album putting her own twist on it. Needless to say, the Album jacket is the most interesting part of the whole disk.Sad."
3,Not their best,"I love earlier Erasure, but I have not gotten into this album yet. Great songs from other artists, but something is not complete about the delivery and arrangements. I may change my mind as I listen to it more, but so far I have to force myself to do that."
3,GET THE ORIGINALS,"Although we all love erasure, thier love of great 70s and 80s music should make the average fan seek out some of the originals as well. The Korgis were a great wierd little new wave band that splintered off from Lindisfarne (a great wierd little organic fairie-rock band) and People should get to know Steve Harley better ... he was the inspiration for so many 80's bands. More glam than T.Rex, more bizarre than early Bowie. He is SO underrated. And when band's like Erasure (and Duran Duran before them) cover his music, I hope he see's a spike in sales of the original. But would somebody please cover something besides Make Me Smile? Harley's got a huge catalog! Anyway, I gave this only 3 stars because, personally, I would have rather seen more covers from the 70's than the rockier stuff from the 50s and early 60's."
5,Clásico de la Salsa,"Todavía recuerdo la primera vez que escuché (por radio) a ""Pedro Navaja"". Estaba entrando a un estacionamiento y no pude salir del automóvil hasta que no terminó. Inmediatamente después que salí del hospital (había ido a visitar a una amiga recluída), fui a comprar el LP, el que todavía conservo. Los otros números también ""pegaron"" acá en Puerto Rico, y a Rubén Blades se le admira y quiere como ""Panamariqueño"". Los arreglos y la banda de Willie Colón: impecables. Este disco es sencillamente una joya que no debe faltar en la discoteca de ningún hispanoparlante que sienta admiración y orgullo por la música latina, lo que hoy se llama ""salsa""."
3,Well it's okay but not great,"Its made out of a thinner flexible metal. Over time the metal will loose strength and you will have to squeeze the clip inward to make its gripping strength better. My review is kinda biased I admit, I own a Joe Porper Card Clip and it's much better quality but cost about $30. I bought this because it's cheap but quality suffered. As for doing the job it does work to some extent. It does provide pressure on the deck but I would say its equally distributed amoun the pack of cards. Joe Porper clips make miracles lol"
1,Really?....,"If you are looking for synthesized music then you have found your album. The ""jazz"" band that accompanies is all computer and embarrassing. The soloist did some interesting interpretations, and I was not thrilled about his sound. I was looking for a decent recording of the Shaw Concerto and I bought this without reading a single review, and I regret it. I highly recommend the John Bruce Yeh recording of the Shaw Concerto. It is a great recording with a terrific jazz combo and Mr. Yeh has one of the best sounds in the country."
4,Lotta Fun,"This game is a must have for fans of the theme parks! It is suprising how many park memories you can 'relive' with this game.The game is a little easy and users are not given a difficulty choice, but other than that the attention to detail is great."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Not able to play the DVD-A portions of the the Brick. I've tried all of the discs, all with the same results. The Disc boots up fine, I get all the menus. I can play the extra videos and pick between 5.1 and stereo tracks. Everything works fine until I actually try to play the dvd-a tracks. Then, the song screen comes up, no sound, and the player freezes to the point I have to turn off the player just to get the disc out. All other DVD-A's I have play great, what's up with this set? With so many complaints, I hope they'11 rework the format. It just doesn't work!"
2,"If you didn't buy your player this year, DON'T BUY THIS!","I have grown tired of unplugging my player just to regain control of it! Once I commit to playing the DVD Audio tracks it locks up so tight that on/off on the face of the machine won't even reset it. I of course get no sound.While I'm bitching, it would seem that David Byrne's vocals on several tracks of the Remain In Light CD have been backed down to barely audible. The big hit sounds great though ...hmmm.Maybe when their contract with Rhino runs out, this music will get the treatment it deserves. I hope I'm still alive to hear it!"
3,"Rhino, please put out the separate issues in a user-friendly format","I'm committing one of my own pet peeves by reviewing a product I haven't bought. The word is that Rhino is issuing the eight albums individually in January 2006, and I'm hoping/guessing that someone there looks at Amazon reviews.I would have bought Brick on the day of release, but was wary because of problems I'd heard about with the DualDisc format, and based on the numerous reviews here where people are having problems playing the discs, I'll pass and take my chances on one of the single reissues in January. Six stars for the Talking Heads catalog with bonus tracks. Zero stars for the DualDiscs (give us CD/DVD two-disc sets and I for one will be happy to pay whatever the cost difference would be)."
1,A Travesty,"I just bought this set, stupidly thinking the problems noted by so many had been fixed. They haven't. I couldn't get the CD side to play on either of my two players, the first a $10,000 Naim, the second a Denon Universal that plays everything, except of of course these. Inexcusable."
4,Heads+5.1= New Feeling,"First of all, the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is that the DVD-A part doesnt play in my player. But, I was able to use my the setting menu of my DVD player to have it read the video portion so I can access the mixes in Dolby Digital.The DVD-A presntation is fantastic. The menus mix in with the art concepts of the album, the sound is amazing, and having all eight albums in one ultra modern looking box is very conveniant.Linernotes are well and work in great with the long overdue remastering of the catalog.Since I have the ""Once in a Lifetime"" box I was a bit dissapointed with having the videos on the DVDs....but the 5.1 mixes are on them and it's splended. (also not all the vids are there so its nice to have Storytelling Giant.)All in all, if you are a heads fan and want to take the risk of not possibly accessing the Advance Restolution sound, go for it!"
3,How could Rhino have missed this?,"My primary question is, how could Rhino have missed the fact that the high-resolution audio wouldn't play on a number of commonly used universal players? I have a Pioneer universal player, and like others, have to unplug it to ""unlock"" the player. It will play in Dolby 5.1 and sounds good, but I keep asking myself, what I am missing. Are there any plans for Rhino to ""make good"" on this set?"
1,DVD-A Tracks Will Not Play,"I'm having the same problem as some other folks here. The DVD-A tracks will not play, and the entire machine is locked up after the menus. This set is going back!"
2,Warning Sign,"The Dualdisc format says it plays on most DVD players. Better test drive this baby before purchasing as the DVD Audio doesn't play in my Pioneer and other reviewers have noted it won't play in other systems. Have had no problems with other DVD Audio discs. So now I stuck trying to decide if I should buy a new DVD player and run two decks, one for this cd and the other for CDs/SACDs etc. or return it."
2,More Audio Problems,"Although Brick should be worth 5 stars, the problems people are having with the discs is inexcusable. So minus three stars for bad disc mastering. Unlike others here, my problem is with the CD side. My Denon DVD 2900 plays all discs fine on the DVD side but totally rejects the CD side on all eight albums. Even though I will probably play the surround side more often I would at times like to be able to listen to the albums as I know them in their original stereo."
5,"Oh, damn them...","...just when I thought my Heads collection was complete they had to go and put this out. But, so what if I had to sell a little plasma - I can make more.Pricey, but worth it. The surround sound mixes are spectacular and the presentation is typically excellent in that arty-farty Talking Heads way. The white brick effect makes quite the splendid ""objet"" that will do any mantelpiece of shelf proud...Very cool extras, too."
3,Frustrated As Hell at This Point,The DVD-Audio is not working on my Pioneer DVD-Audio/Super Audio player. I'm devastated. HELP!!!
2,Minnesota Fats cue stick holder,"I was very disappointed in my order. First of all, I ordered a cherry wood cue stick holder. When it came, it was a maple or the like. I decided it would be more trouble to sent it back than it was worth. So, I kept it. I was giving it to my daughter for a birthday gift. I helped put it together and was somewhat happy with it except it seemed kind of small. I had one years ago that was perfect. Well, where it is designed to put the balls for the pool table, all but two of the balls would fit. The one I had years ago would accommodate all the balls, as this one should. Why accommodate all but two balls? Because it was not regulation size! I gave it to my daughter and her family and they are happy just to have a place to put the pool sticks, but I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,Teach Yourself Visually Word 2003,"I purchased this book as a reference to the older Word program I have in my PC. I have a working knowledge of some word-processing programs, and the majority of the work I do with my PC does not require the use of word-processing; however, when I do need to use the program, I want to be able to do it correctly. This book was perfect for my purpose. I do not have to spend a lot of time learning and reviewing material that I don't need. At the same time, I can quickly look up the information that I do need, and also correct any errors that I have made, or questions that I have before completing the work."
1,Quack = boring,"Don't know why this book was rated so high by the Oppenheimer Toy Fund. I thought it was insipid and lacked any type of plot whatsoever. Not educational, not fun, not engaging. Just stupid. Save your money and skip this one."
1,terrible customer service and policies,"I just got my Cintiq 21UX. It's an awesome piece of equipment, not backed by a good company. I have more than one dead subpixel, and their policy is up to 14 DEAD SUBPIXELS!C'mon?! I'm a graphic designer, and this is what over $2000.00 gets me?I'm past disappointed w/ their policies and service."
3,Nail dryer is a bust,"As the other reviewers said, the dryer never worked from the outset. I complained to Amazon and they were very good about offering a refund or exchange. The other things in the set were good and. My daughter had a blast at her slumber party with her friends painting their nails."
4,Great gift,Great gift for young girls. I gave the product to an eight year old girl for Christmas. She loved it!
3,Not too bad I guess,Well it arrived early but thats really the best thing. Its not that great except to make a mess with all the little pieces. Atleast it comes with a bag to put it all in.
2,Good customer service but poor quality nail dryer,The nail dryer in the first kit we ordered did not work. I contacted the company and was sent another kit plus some extra items for the trouble. The second nail dryer worked a couple times then quit. I did not bother getting it replaced.
3,it was for my niece,if your child is over the age of 8 its not for them. the colors are not bright and it fades easily. i liked it because everything works good in the package but you need to put the product with the right age child. my niece is 10 so she still plays with it but we bought better nail polish for her from the dollar store.
1,Do not waste your money!!,"Bought two of these and was so excited for my daughter and her little friend(they're 2) and upon opening the gifts, the glitter case was busted in one of them, the nail polish doesn't stay on through a shower and the carry bags ripped as soon as you lift them up after filling them with the nail polish and stuff!! Really horrible"
1,Buyers Beware!!,"This is a perfect example of ""seller abuse"". I separeted the ""Ultimate Nail Studio Kit"" for $17.50 3 months in advance and I was waiting for black Friday to maybe save a little money but instead of decreasing in price it sky high all the way to $49.99!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! to tell you more I still have it on my saved basket for the original price (of course when I click on it it takes me to the new price but is to prove that in fact was waayyyyyy cheaper). So don't waste your money instead wait to see if this seller has a little bit if sensitive left and stop trying to still money from us customers. Or simply move to another gift... Is not worth it!"
1,Don't Buy this Product,This was a gift and never worked from the time we opened it. The girls still played with it but what a disappointment!
2,A bit disappointed,The product arrived in a timely manner.However after just 1 use the nail dryer quit working.This is a major part of this product and a letdown to our daughter.
2,A Waste of Money,"My daughter was pining for this really badly. She had a gift certificate for Amazon and decided to spend it on this since the packaging looks so cool. We usually like the Creativity for Kids products although many are similar in that there is super cool packaging but not much substance.The kit includes foam cutouts for toe separation - nothing fancy, just foam. The pedicure slippers are just flat pieces of thin foam that has a slipper shape cut-out with the straps precut. The slippers are absolutely worthless and don't last.The nails don't stay on, the dryer is very low power and the rest of the stuff is below average. I don't usually pan a product but going to the drug store and picking up separate parts to create your own kit would be better and more fun than this set."
1,"Cheap, poorly made product!","The nail polishes are poor quality. It would take about 3 coats to make it not see-through. However, the nail polishes take forever to dry (and for little kids it's hard to sit that long) so putting on 3 coats is next to impossible. The toe separators are HUGE!!! Isn't this for a little girl??? The emery boards are so flimsy, they bend when you try to use them. The nail dryer blows so little air that it would be faster to blow on them with your mouth. The fake nails do not come with any sort of adhesive to attach them to your own nails!"
2,Broken,"Well, I love the pattern and I'm set on getting another one of these mobiles to match the bed set, BUT the thing fell apart as soon as I put it together. The pin popped out of the mobile (the piece that plays music and rotates) and the entire canopy fell into the crib. I was very disappointed. I'm going to have to return it and hope the new one isn't broken as well. Oh yeah, I have a Delta Elizabeth crib and the mobile will only fit on the guard rail, not on the side of the crib. The sides are too big. :o("
2,Doesn't fit!,just bought it today - love the decor but the clamp is about 1/2 inch too small for our Simplicity Ellis convertable crib - so disappointing & frustating -we're off to BRUs to return it & find another one - ugh.....needs to be re-designed to make it more adjustable.
2,Cut and paste...,"This CD was a disappointment. Although We continues to invent interesting sounds and weaves them into catchy, deep tunes, this record sounds like artists' block. Except for the excellent track ""Out for now,"" the rest of the CD is filled with stuff that sounds like it was fed into a sequencer by a bored technician. Harsh judgment, but true. They are simply capable of better work.Although many have commented that they don't like ""Square Root of Minus One,"" Square Root beats Decentertainment in musicality, variety, and the kind of creativity that makes We true composers in my book. They are the only ones who have made a dial tone something worth listening to (seriously, the first track is amazing). You will also find some of their best work on ""Incursions in Illbient"" (three tracks) and ""Necropolis"" (one track) as well as on their first record ""As Is."""
1,From Amazon-Not a Honeywell filter !!!!,"As titled in the Amazon.com web page, I believed I had ordered an HC-15 HONEYWELL Humidifier Filter. What I received was an RPS products knock off. Nowhere on the boxed filters I received does it say Honeywell. Why? because it isn't!!! I'm not certain how this is advertised as a ""Honeywell"" product. Honeywell is a registered trademark, and to my knowledge not licensed to RPS Products ""Best Air"". Will the filters work? Perhaps."
1,Caffeine Pill in Hiding,"I started taking these pills three days ago. While they were not what I wanted (I wanted just green tea pills, not a mixature), I decided to give them a try. After three restless nights I traced it back to these pills. Each pill has 200 mg of caffeine. And by following the directions, which state to take one pill mid morning followed by a pill and a glass of water. Then to repeat it again in mid afternoon. I was pumping myself full of 400 mg of caffeine. These pills are not worth it."
2,"Eat Less, Move More...","That is truly the key to successful weight loss. I decided to take these as a supplement to se if they enhanced my performance (I exercise regularly and eat healthfully). I honestly can't tell if they helped, but I can say that after a few months of taking these pills I began to suffer from the most painful pressure headaches that would last anywhere from 2-8 hours. Essentially all this pill has to offer is sleepless nights, painful headaches and minimal if any healthy weight loss. Skip them in favor of a nice brisk walk around the block every day!"
3,Not great for guitarists,"Guitar chords are provided, but there are no tabs. Since this music is synthesized most songs sound weird on guitar. Hopefully they will make a guitar edition or Jewel will re-record the cd acoustic. Other than that, everything is pretty accurate."
3,Good but not great,"A review of this book is most fair when it is broken into three sections of 60 pages each. The first two sections are fantastic as it takes us through the story of Gipo, a man haunted by informing on his best friend. O'Flaherty does a fantastic job of painting the scene of poverty in Dublin that would lead to someone informing on their buddy... and then we have the pleasure of watching him use the blood money. If it ended on page 120, I would definitely give the book 5 stars.The last 60 pages are very boring and drawn out. Whereas the story could have been a fascinating tell of the above mentioned material, the last is so obvious, that it is physically painful waiting for the conclusion.All in all, the book is a great study in the darker side of human behavior. I am glad that I read it for that reason. However, the climax leaves a lot to be desired."
1,What was that?,I don't understand what happened in this book. There was hardly any plot line. The characters did not develop well enough either. I wish I could have given this zero stars.
3,good source of information but filled with biased.,"There are very good and useful information about some less-popular styles such as Ryuei Ryu and different branches of Shorin ryu. However, the author added so much of his own criticism of instructors, usually about their personalities and manners, and at times I wonder why he has an authority to criticize some senior instructors of Okinawa, the birth place of Karate-do.The author shows very little, and sometimes no respect to Japanese/Okinawa senior instructors. Having said that, this is still a good book and will add some historical perspective to a serious Karate-ka."
4,Important book for any serious collection,"The book gives some important and little known lineage information. It is interesting how various styles were blended, refined and improved over time. Links between various styles indicate the richness - and combat readiness - of the so-called ""traditional martial arts"" of Okinawa and Japan. Often it was the best practicioners that left their island to humble themselves before another teacher on the Chinese mainland. What they brought back and mixed in is a testament to their legacy."
5,Ode to a Neighborhood,"Having attended high school with Mr. Cohen, I was not surprised to find that his first book was well-crafted, engaging and intelligent. I was a little surprised that he didn't make his name in the field of music or academia first. (I do note that he lists playing guitar as a hobby in his bio.) He chose the detective novel as his genre, but it reads as much as a love song to the Red Hook neighborhood as anything. It is a scholarly book, and an emotional one. It manages to approach two common themes and freshly synthesize them into the detective genre: suppression of childhood trauma (as in Hitchcock's Marnie) and poor father-son communications/relationship. The police work seems authentic, but it is only part of the story. I am a fan of James Lee Burke, Earl Emerson, Robert B. Parker, and Dashiell Hammett. The book holds up in this company. Whether you are a detective fan or not, you will enjoy this book."
1,ultimately a letdown,the first chapter has zing but the ending was with a thud as if the author didn't know how to wrap things up and so resorted to comicbook formula. this left a sour taste for me.
2,"I say, I only hear what I want to","Exactly, you only hear what you want from this CD only 2 songs You say and I do her 2 hottest singles from the 90's that's it the rest of it it's not that WOOW!!! That we say but is OK"
3,Missing A Single...,"All of Lisa Loeb's well known songs and singles are on this disc, except for ""Play All Day"" which was a track from the Rugrats Movie Soundtrack. Without this track on this disc, I feel hesistant about buying it.Although I am only a lukewarm Loeb fan, bigger fans might find this album as a nice addition to their collection."
3,Only one new song,"Nothing new here if you already have her albums. not sung any different from her original songs. The only new song is the one from her TV show ""Number One Single"". They are all good songs, but not worth buying again."
4,Another great Littles Book,"This is another great Littles"" book. However, the buyer should beware that it is simply an abridged and illustrated version of ""the Littles to the Rescue."" If your child is too young for chapter books, this would be a great starter that will make the transition to the chapter Littles books easier. In our case we had already read The Littles to the Rescue"" chapter book, so this was a little disappointing. The page ought to point out its relationship to to the original.By the way, ""the Littles Go Around the World"" is a similar treatment of ""The Littles Go To School."" Just so you know!"
5,OGIO All Terrain,Love this bag -- it's sturdy and very well put together; the interlocking handles are a nice touch. Great for use as both a gym bag and a weekend getaway bag (carry-on friendly as well).
4,Good backpacker,"This is a good backpack. The only problem I had was that she gave a piece of rubber, but I'm still advising the purchase of this backpack."
3,Pretty good,"This is not a fast fix, but over 6 weeks I lost 4 pounds and have not been successfull with anything else. The stickey marks come off easily with bath oil, and if you don't stick them in the same spot every time, they do not irritate much. I've tried other patches and have come back to this product for a slow, but sure weight loss program. Great for reducing appetite!"
2,ill stick to low carb diets,"Ive been using these for 4 weeks and I look nothing more like a patch work, with itchy reddish brown jag-ged squares all over my body,there are 10 packets of ""stickers"" in the box, and you're to stick them on different parts of your body with a new one every 3 days,Sticking them on was fun, taking them off was hair raising, they werent like band aids that come with friendly adhesives, I had to rub liquid soap and warm water to take them off and they would leave a mark. They were there no matter how much I exfoliated my skin and when I peeled it off at one go, it left a scar like the first one already did,I just hope the scar will fade off someday.I lost about 3.5 pounds in total,but its a lousy tradeoff for looking like a patchwork.Only my sis was impressed by the effortless weightloss but Im sticking to low carb diets."
1,Waste of money,"These were a total waste of money. The patches are hard to stick on without having them stick together, and they always came off early. I could tell no difference in my appetite, and I lost no weight in using them. Can anyone tell me how to get my money back?"
3,Word of advice,"Something to keep in mind when using a patch of any kind, including this one: if you have an allergic reaction to the patch, that in itself can create a kind of barrier so that the patch does not work. Whatever the ingredients are, they won't cross the threshold of the irritated skin.I have not used this product, but this is true as a rule of thumb for anything that works as a patch."
1,No effect of whatsoever,"I remember buying this product 3 years ago, being excited that it would work but it never did. The patches are not sticking properly and if you sweat a little, they can come out - and leave some nasty stuff on your skin (like a chewing gum). When it comes to cravings - I personally did not notice any changes in my appetite (meaning I still wanted to eat :), neight I lost any weight. I personally will never buy it again, I have even trashed the rest of the patches."
1,Dont be fooled,"This product is useless and so are the raving 5 star reviews. All I got was square patches of darkened irritated skin after trying this for a month. Three months later I still have dark squares on my back (no bikinis for me). And its not that my skin is sensitive- its as strong as hide, I've never had a rash/allergic reaction in my life until this!!! Very disappointing!The happy 5 star ""reviewers"" have only ever reviewed one thing - these patches. the ones who give real reviews have reviewed many things over the course of time on amazon. Dont believe all that you read!"
3,Do these patches work?,I am thinking of trying the Slim Form Patch to loose weight but I don't want to waste my money on something that doesn't work. They seem too good to be true. I would appriciate it if someone got back to me.
4,Slim form Patch,"I have been using this patch for about 6 weeks and I have just placed my second order. Is it ""the answer"" to all weight loss problems? Does the fat melt off magically? No. But I have lost 5 pounds this month without doing anything different. And that is something different for me...because I do not lose weight easily...even with starving and exercise. You see, I am over 50 and the weight came on within the last 8 years. 5 pounds is not a lot....but this time next year....maybe I will be a size 3!!! Just a joke. But...I am going to re-order, and see where this goes!"
4,Welcome addition to God Matters,"A second collection of articles and sermons by Herbert McCabe, one of the most brilliant British theologians of the 20th century. McCabe published very little while alive and so it is very exciting to see more of his writings being made available posthumously. The book again demonstrates the huge range of McCabe's thought and showcases once again his sparklingly lucid and witty prose. His article entitled ""The Logic of Mysticism"" is vintage McCabe, provocative, surprising and, above all, thoughtful. A must for anyone with an interest in thinking about God."
4,good but not quite expected,"Having heard all there previous albums i thought i knew what to expect from this album especially with original vocalist Jim Jidhed and band back together. I thought it would be an 80's highly polished pop sounding performance. Instead, it's more like early 80's NWOBHM type of bluesy Metal/rock sound with vocals that sound an awfull lot like Biff Bryford of Saxon. and like earlier Alien releases, J.Jidhed's solo albums are very polished aswell and he's compared favorably with pop vocalist like steve perry and the like. Here he sounds alot rawer and more strained. Don't get me wrong thou.... I like it, but it was just such a departure from there previous sound. but after a few listens i began to appreciate it for what it is and not what it isn't. so if you like early NWOBHM like Praying Mantis, Iron Maidens first album, Saxon, Quartz etc.... check it out! it's perhaps not the same song writing quality as these bands but still worth a listen."
1,Do not buy this,The pant tore after one month. Heavy Duty my ___! It wasn't worth the price. I had to end up buying another suit from someone else.
5,THE ONE AND ONLY LA VOZ,"There are a lot of young salsa performers out there, but not one them can touch the artistry of Hector Lavoe. He and all of the other Fania artists were, and still are the best. It's a classic. La Voz is one to have if you're seriously into classic salsa!"
2,Battery died before the countdown finished!,"My countdown was just a little bit longer than a year and this came with a ""long-lasting"" lithium battery but it died 6 months before the end of the countdown!! VERY disappointing. I like the product otherwise -- easy to set, fun to be motivated by the counting down, etc., but once the screen goes dead it's just a $25 dust-catcher sitting on my desk."
4,Gets your heart rate up!,"I'm new to TaeBo, so my review may be different from seasoned TaeBo users. I love this DVD. It really gets my heart rate up. I like that he changes moves often....you don't get bored that way. I do find some of the choreography difficult to follow, but after doing it a few times, you gradually pick up on it. I think this is a great way to get your heart rate up and challenge your body to push itself. He has people in the video ""counting"" the whole time, which can really be annoying, but the payoffs are worth it! Great way to burn calories!"
4,I liked it but...,"I agree with the Tae bo regulars who said this dvd had too much down time and not really a cardio workout.Great for beginners to get into it or for one of those days it's hard to get motivated. I think it's a great addition to the collection. oh, and I like it when billy messes up. It's like he's human instead of this super work out guy."
3,Wow,"I can see that my opinion of this Tae Bo video is quite different from the other reviewers. I'm a die-hard Tae Bo fan, but this one just didn't cut it. Billy slows down way too often, then only has short bursts of true cardio. Some of the moves were awkward, and there was far too much punching. This gets three stars because it IS still Tae Bo, but there are far better Billy Blanks workouts out there."
2,Too slow!,"I've been doing tae bo for 10 months now, and I'm always eager to try out a new video. I rented this from Netfix to try it out, and I'm glad I did: this video is awful. 15 minutes into it and my heart rate wasn't even raised. I stopped it because I felt like I was wasting my time. If you're a long-term Tae Bo fan, do yourself a favor and do Amped, Bootcamp, or Get Ripped."
2,Not my favorite Tae Bo Video :(,"Wow, this is hard for me to do because I LOVE TAE BO, but this DVD is bad! As mentioned in another review, it is so fast that you are unable to keep proper form. You will be huffing and puffing from jumping around so much (thus the 2 stars), but I do not think muscle toning of any sort is possible. I have lots of TAE BO DVDs and consider myself fit, but I actually think I might hurt myself moving at this pace. It is also disappointing to see how poorly edited the video is, not that any of Billy Blanks videos are perfect -- but man! Not sure if I am buying any more Tae Bo unless I get to preview it first."
1,Cheesy,You get what you pay for! This video was totally cheesy and not choreographed very well either. Billy kept messing up the routine and I barely broke into a sweat. Don't waste your time. I threw mine in the trash after I did it.
2,the worst of Billy,"I am a huge fan of Billy and have been since the 4 pack vhs set. Meeting him is actually on my bucket list. However, had I done this workout first, I would feel differently. I don't know how you could know you are going to make a workout dvd, and seem to have absolutlely no plan in mind. It is like he is just winging it through the whole thing. And what is he wearing? Seriously, It is ridiculous. In taebo advanced I loved Shelly and considered her a great example. But in this work out she was just wierd and manic. I do not recommend this to anyone. What a let down, Billy."
2,Hard To Follow,"The first 20 minutes of this workout was great and I was liking it better than the Tae Bo Cardio DVD I have. I don't mind him slowing down to show a new combination because it gave me a minute to catch my breath. I did notice he messed up a couple of times and there was one leg he never got to on a certain move, but I wasn't too bothered by it. But the last half of the workout involved some pretty tricky combos that I found hard to follow. It will probably take me several run-throughs of this workout to start getting the steps correctly. If you are really coordinated or pick up combinations quickly you might not have a problem.At the end, I am still much more satisfied with the Cardio DVD as I consider it more the perfect length and I was able to do it from start to finish without really getting noticeably confused on any of the combos. The Celebrity DVD seemed too long too me as it was beginning to get repetitive."
2,Boring,This video has the same moves as his older videos. I was disappointed at the lack of variety. The people doing the exercise along with Blanks were out of sync and Blanks himself would forget a step or two. Since getting the video I have used it twice. It does not motivate me to work out.
2,Tae Bo Fan - but this is not good,I LOVE Tae Bo and have been using it since 1997. This workout is more of a 'beginning' workout. Some of it is fun but he does WAY too much explaining and I think by trying to mix it up - he makes it complicated and you're so focused on watching/learning and then by the time you actually get to the 'workout' part - you're bored and your heart rate isn't up so it seems pointless. There are some good - heart pumping parts - but you get slowed down in the middle by the 'directions' he is giving instead of the workout you should be doing! Save your money on this one and buy the Get Ripped Series.
2,Taebo Celebrity Cardio Bummer,I was disappointed. I am a Taebo fan from way back and have to say his latest dvds are not as challenging. This one was way too slow. Too much slowing down. I like to keep moving. Someone said they would not recommend this for beginner. I feel this is more for a beginner. Truly disappointed.
2,Not the best,"I got this on loan from the library, to try some new TAE BO. I've done different TAE BO in the past and usually I'm drenched in sweat and exhaustated at the end. That was not the case with this one. There were too many basic moves and at about 15 minutes in I hadn't even sweated yet. Then there all of these complicated dance-like moves with very little instruction. I'm sure once someone gets the form down right, they would probably get the heart pumping pretty fast, but I couldn't do it and more often than not I was scratching my head going ""huh?"". At the end, I had only sweated lightly and felt like I didn't get much of a workout, and it is most definitley not a ""celebrity"" workout. And Shelly is incredibly annoying in this video, way too enthuisastic, so much that I turned the volume down. I'd pass on this one, there are much better TAE BO dvd's out."
1,Not a great workout,"The moves were easy to follow in the beginning of the workout, but as it got tougher to follow the workout got to be less of a workout and more of trying to figure out moves. I didn't find this to be a good workout at all....didn't keep me going."
3,Good workout but.............,The workout was great!!! I was sore after. There were a few muscles that have not worked in a while & this dvd found them. Some of the moves are a little fast but you can modify it & still get a good workout. I give it a three due to his daughter getting on my last nerve & the music is so low I don't know what is playing.
1,Yawn! What happened to the old Taebo?,"I would say my fitness level is beginner to intermediate. I could get through the basic original Taebo but could never make it through the advanced tapes. So that's where I'm at. After reading the reviews I thought this would be a fun dvd that would get me sweating! Um NO! I turned it off at the 12minute mark and forwarded through the rest of the video. This dvd was so boring. After 10 minutes I was like ""you're kidding right?"" I did not even breaking a sweat.Lot's of toe stepping and punching in the air= yawn. It did pick up after a while with some leg kicks...but that didn't hold my attention.I bought this today, I'm selling this one right now. What a waste of money."
1,Not really cardio,"Having used several of Billy Blanks DVDs for working out, I found that this one was by far the worst. Besides the strange moves and not-so-great instruction, it failed to get my heart rate up at all. Also, it was pretty short (only 40 minutes). If you are looking for a better tae-bo video, I would suggest the Tae-Bo get ripped series. I regularly use these and feel like I get a good overall workout from them."
3,Good But Jumpy,"This is a decent cardio workout, but Mr. Blanks starts out well and then begins to get jumpy - from exercise to exercise with much less of a streamlined execution than usual. Some of the combinations he has you do are a bit complicated and in my opinion the pay off for executing these is really not worth it.Billy Blanks - Cardio Bootcamp Liveis one option if you want Billy Blanks, Tae Bo, and cardio all in one DVD. It's a little shorter and makes use of the resistance bands, but is much easier to follow. It's not as intense as Get Celebrity Fit in my opinion, but it's a lot more streamlined and won't confuse you.Billy Blanks' Tae Bo: Fat Blasting Cardiois a much better choice in my opinion, and works you out better than Get Celebrity Fit or Cardio Bootcamp. It's a solid workout similar to Cardio Bootcamp in execution but with the higher intensity of Get Celebrity Fit PLUS a notch or two. Try this one!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"I am new to tae bo and was so excited to get started. This video is not what I anticipated though....it is VERY hard to follow. Big disappointment. The Ab Bootcamp is terrific, but not the cardio :("
1,Bad Acting Bad Movie Bad Story can I get my 3.99 back,"AWFUL the best thing about this movie is the trailer and the movie cover, the actors are awful story disjointed they probably left all the good parts on the editing room floor."
1,grrrrrrrrrrrr,this movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! i was really hoping it was going to be at-least ok but it more than failed. I would not recommend it to anyone if you really want to waste your money throw it in the trash
1,A very poor Christmas release movie,"Just bought this on Blu-ray. I watched about 45 mins, and had to turn it off. This has to be one of the worst holidays movies out there. To be relased around Christmas time, usually movies are pretty decent. This was straight up bad. I would not recommend wasting time watching this flick. It was a B-rated type movie."
1,Worst movie of 2011.,"I skipped this in theaters because of all the negative feedback it got. Just watched it and wow.. this movie is indeed AWFUL. Horrible acing, weak plot, bad special effects, the list goes on and on. AVOID!"
2,Below Average,"This was a lame-ass movie that I mostly watched for the kids. Once through was bearable, but more than enough."
2,Don't waste your time,"This movie was no good. It was hard to follow and really left me wondering why I even watched it. The best parts of it were in the trailer. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the special effects are pretty cool. Story line, not so much."
1,Never let me play it now it's not available to me,I was charged but I was never able to view it. Now it's not available to me I'm not sure who to contact to get this problem resolved.
1,useless cant play on my 3d player due to region and single disc,the disc would not play due to the single disc and the region so i found this to be very disappointing..
4,Great Movie!,This is a great movie. This is for anyone who likes sci-fi action and adventure. I did like watching it.
3,"So, so.","Very imaginative creatures and clever setting, weighted with an ordinary story line and pedestrian characters. Made for teenage audiences. It's what an old acquaintance once called a ""popcorn"" movie - you watch it, eat some popcorn, and the next day you've forgotten what you saw."
4,Definitely Worth Watching,"Finally. A solid science fiction thriller that is not a freakin' re-make. It is a *new* film, based on an excellent original story and script.Artistically filmed using intriguing Moscow locations with good pacing throughout.Science fiction films do not require massive special effects. The effects here are distinctive and effectively highlight the story.As I say in my title, this is definitely worth watching."
3,Fine,"This was a pretty good film really, special effects were good, and the look and feel ok, the plot was a little shaky, but we are not in ""Citizen Kane"" territory here. I enjoyed this film. Not a huge amount, but i enjoyed it nevertheless, and after all, isnt that what its all about?PS - It gave new York a day off being constantly destroyed all the time, so thats grrovy."
1,A really bad movie all around...,"Okay. There is so much to dislike about this movie that I could go on and on.Short version: Don't waste your money until its free on Amazon Prime.Reg version: Actors, plot, plot holes, stereotypes, predictable all of them sucked. The story's premise was interesting and could have been written/produced much better. Really it was like watching a straight to dvd/vhs low budget movie. No it wasn't even that good, at least then, sometimes, it can be funny but this movie blew.AVOID!!!!! Believe me, I prevented myself from watching it. I was skeptical but then I was bored and said ""what the heck, may be it'll be decent"" no it wasn't. I would have been better off twiddling my thumbs for an 1 and a half."
2,I wouldn't really buy it.,"American's in Moscow during alien invasion. Not too high a budget, but not done badly. Interesting ""aliens"". But got bored with it and did not finish it."
2,A Dissapointment,The 3D on this film was almost non-existent! The movie was not all that exciting. I love post apocalyptic movies and this one is not going to be at the top of my favorites
4,Movie...,"This movie was not as bad as it was stated in the 1 star reviews. It did not have a big Hollywood budget to start with. Yes, the plot is not great, the acting is okay, the visuals are acceptable. The ending could be better. It was too simple. However, it kept me entertained for 120 minutes."
2,the trailer is better than the movie.,"the trailer is better than the movie. the plot, location, and protagonists are good. but the content of the story and the dialog are not. the trailer got my hopes up too high for the film."
3,Not Bad. Not Good Either.,"A business trip to Moscow goes from bad to worse for two friends that get caught in the middle of an alien invasion. First, all of the electronic devices are disabled by a massive microwave pulse from space. Then the aliens start floating down to Earth, at times they glow orange, but they are mostly invisible to the human eye. These aliens are not interested in communication, they simply want to eliminate humans from the planet so that they can harvest the Earth's resources. This is a decent adventure story. Some of the special effects are interesting, for example, when we get to see the alien's perspective. It has a decent amount of action. Due to its larger budget, it is slightly better than a SyFy prime time apocalypse movie, but the acting and plot is mediocre at best. Don't expect The Darkest Hour to blow your mind, but it will serve as entertainment if you have a couple of hours to kill and nothing good is on tv."
3,OUT OF THIS WORLD LIGHT BILL,"Okay, this movie was fun and entertaining, just keep the lights on and the brain turned off. Now all the aliens had to do was to shut down the almighty cloud and pizza delivery, and the modern world would come to an end. I just don't think aliens that are that technologically advanced would have to use that much effort to snub out modern man - They'd probably do it remotely."
2,Boring,"Been done before, then again what has'nt, new what was going to happen before it did. It would be worth watching at 1.99"
1,Nope,"Uh-uh. No. Just keep looking. Pass this one by.Your family will disown you if you bring this movie home.It's sad, but not on purpose.It smells like urine."
2,Darkest Hour 3D,The movie was one of the worst movie I've seen and the 3D effect was not on point. I would not recommend it to a friend.
4,Aliens vs Humans in Russia: is a sequel in place?,"The only exciting thing about this movie is seeing the hot actresses running around in tight jeans! I'd give 5/5 stars for that, less 1 star for the disappointing anti-climax. At the closing scene, I'm still left wondering if ... { CENSORED since some prospective viewers prefer not to know how a movie ends ... sorry! } ... The last scene leaves too much room for speculation on possible future events relating to the characters.There isn't enough action or suspense in this movie, just a handful of humans running around, trying to hide, and figuring out how to outwit somewhat invisible alien invaders.Recommended viewing:Go back in time with actress Sigourney Weaver to watch how she deals with aliens!AlienAliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"
3,Interesting concept...poor execution....,Not really much to say outside of this being an interesting concept but very poor execution. The movie is way too short...entertaining to waste a bit of time but nothing that will leave a mark on one's memory that lasts a long time. Something to pass some time...the story could have been developed a lot more and followed some better principles and logic but alas it didn't. :-(
1,The Darkest Hour,The Darkest Hour is a movie that should be left in the Dark. It's story line is Dead. The special effects were the worst. The only thing I can see good about this movie was the ending. I can say save your money and don't rent or buy this movie.The Darkest Hour
3,surprisingly good,"especially for what looks like a relatively low budget endeavor. casting was good, actors were likeable, dialog felt fresh, the pacing was crisp, and while it followed the usual structure (5 survivors becomes 4, then 3, then 2, etc) it offered a few surprises along the way. it made excellent use of the Moscow location, and the special effects were not as cheesy as you might expect. worth a rental."
4,"Don't be so serious, people!","I don't know why everyone has ripped so much on this film. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it had an intriguing idea-one I've not seen before. I never went to the theatre to see it because of all the negative reviews. Finally, once it was available here, I went ahead and took a chance. Partly, to be honest, because I am a HUGE fan of Joel Kinnaman.Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked it. It's not a movie I'm watching because it's going to be Oscar nominated (besides-I usually don't care for those anyway). It gave an explanation for why the aliens are on Earth, how to kill them and the end left you with hope.It actually reminded me a bit of Red Dawn or the Australian flick, Tomorrow, After the War Began; everything is not wrapped up in a bow but the end leaves you with hope.I don't know what everyone was expecting, but I thought it was worth watching and did so twice. My mom also watched it and really enjoyed."
1,Muy Mala,"Película con malas actuaciones, malos efectos visuales, pésimo guión.No la recomiendo, no vale la pena ni verla, menos comprarla."
2,sad,"This could have been a really good movie, but felt simply like a rip off of every movie like it...."
2,Low Budget Movie,Not the best but creative. I don't think I will watch it again..But buying movies before seeing them is a risk.
1,B-movie without the 50s charm,"This was one of the worst movies of the year. When the setting is the ONLY thing that a movie has going for it, then you know the script has tanked.It may be mildly interesting the first time you see it. It's flaws really show up when you see it a 2nd and 3rd time.Certainly not what I'm looking for for my collection."
4,The Darkest Hour,"The Darkest Hour was a good movie. The special effects were awesome. I watched the movie straight thru without taking any breaks. The ending could have been different. I think the producers thought maybe they would leave it open so they can make a second movie. However, it was still enjoyable."
3,Ok movie,"Movie was good, but not great. It was worth a rent but not a buy in my opinion. Story was ok."
3,FLASH WITHOUT SUBSTANCE,"THE DARKEST HOUR is a sci-fi fantasy with an interesting premise but weak execution. It manages to sustain interest in spite of its flaws.Five young people visiting Moscow find themselves victims of a terrifying alien invasion that decimates the Russian metropolis. They search desperately for other survivors while fending off these aliens who seem to generate electrical energy in their destructive path.Special effects aren't very impressive and the pacing of the film is somewhat slow. Emile Hirsh, Olivia Thirlby, Max Menghella, Rachael Taylor and Joel Kinnaman try gamely in their roles but they're more props than developed characters. Some incredulous plot holes also diminish the storyline.Overall, THE DARKEST HOUR is passable entertainment but doesn't set any new standards in sci-fi cinema. For more credible apocalyptic cinema, check out THE DIVIDE."
2,Unfinished - sort of OK,"This is an unfinished film with a few bright spots. If there were such a thing as 2.5 stars, that is where I would rate it. It is just a bit below average. This is an unfinished film it is as though they just ran out of money before they could finish the story. The story doesn't conclude - it just stops in mid stream (quite literally in a sense). I did not feel too robbed at the 3.99 I spent, I was very disappointed at how they just dropped the story at the end, but it is not without some entertainment value. This movie is much better than say a typical Syfy channel production. In fact that is how I would describe this movie - as a bigger budget SyFy Channel movie. If you like that sort of thing, you will enjoy this one."
2,Disappointing 3d,We were really looking forward to this one after seeing the previews which made it seem as if it was going to be a winner. There was very little 3d at all. The plot was so so. Was mostly a let down
2,Low budget.,"Like a made for TV movie. Wish I had my 2 hours back and could ""un"" watch it. Glad I only rented it."
1,started bad and got worse.,"don't really know what to say about this other than the fact that this thing was horrible. Started of like a cheesy teen love movie and ended like, wellin not to sure because i fell asleep."
1,priceless963,"This movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was flimsy and so was the acting. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but the ending was horrible."
1,Darkest Hour HD~,"The movie itself was OK, probably a 3. Different take on the alien invasion theme. We have our HD movies run thru our Sony to our big screen tv. Sadly, we won't be purchasing anymore HD movies thru Amazon as for whatever reason the quality is not good. It really does not look anywhere close to HD. The last movie we tried to order HD we quit viewing 5 minutes into it and purchased on Dishnetwork and it was much better. I love Amazon but sadly there is a problem with us watching HD movies thru them. The regular movies actually look better than the HD."
1,Awful!!!!!!,"This movie is another flop. The acting was terrible, the writing was really bad. The entire thing was early poorly done. We felt ripped off for the few bucks we paid to rent this. Don't waste your time."
1,Terrible!,This movie was terrible!! So predictable. It could have been such a good concept too. Very disappointing. Save your money and skip this one.
4,Better than expected.,"The beginning of the movie avoided the typically formulaic setup to invasion or disaster movies, keeping the viewer interested and caring about the protagonists. The post-invasion world was done well, and the physics behind everything was not so unbelievable (as it tends to be in some movies). If you watch the movie for what it is, it will be quite enjoyable."
2,Moderately lame,"Whoever did the CGI for alien killing graphic did a great job. That is probably the main highlight of the movie. If you are very bored you may enjoy this movie. Unless that is the case be prepared for a weak plot, mediocre acting, and a very cheesy predictable story."
2,sooo much potential,"couldnt get past the girls freaking out in typical girl fashion, pisses me off. the commercials really captured the best parts TT.TT"
3,Enjoyable but thin.,"This movie didn't have much more to it's plot than it's preview showed, and the scenes shown in the trailer were the majority of the intense scenes in the movie. It was a good story and well acted, but it just seemed like it needed a little more depth/intensity to it's plot."
3,"I need a heading between ""I don't like it"" and ""It's OK""","Well ... what to say about this movie. I guess I would love for this movie to simply be better than it was. I am a science fiction fan, and I loved the idea of the ""invisible alien, made up of energy"" premise, and the story started out well, but then sort of ran out of steam, and eventually became silly. Too bad really, as some of the effects were sweet. I chose three stars for it however, two would probably suffice ... but ... as a sci-fi-guy, I did really like some of the scenes in this movie. Do you sense my frustration? If five bucks does not mean much to your entertainment budget, then why not ... just don't have your hopes up too high."
3,A movie for no mental activity,The movie was a good movie for a couple of beers and a warm blanket for a evening with noting to do.
1,worst 3d ever,"waited a long time to buy this as some of the reviews were not so good. after i bought i realized i was glad to spend less the 10.00 price for it. its an okay story but that isn't totally what your buying. we were buying the 3d experience, and boy does not deliver. i own almost all 3d blu rays and this one ranksat the bottom"
3,Meh,This movie has a pretty cool concept and starts of strong. But through the course of the movie the characters become irritating.
4,The Darkest Hour,"We really enjoyed The Darkest Hour. It is a great movie that pulled in Mom & Dad and teenage daughter. It was nice to have a Sci-Fi thriller without all the blood and gore... How they pull off the win in the end is really interesting. It's a good movie with enough suspense to get you on the edge of your chair. Good defeats evil of course, but also has very strong theme of ""keep trying - don't give up"""
3,So-so,"Some interesting 3D views of Moscow (as mentioned by someone else, great crowd control during shooting to create some nice scenes of the city). The plot is so-so, but I bought it for being one of the reasonably priced 3D Blu-rays available."
3,MIXED BAG OF NUTS,"MIXED BAG OF ACTORS, GO FROM OK TO FLAT OUT FIRST DAY ON THE JOB BAD. STORY LINE HAS SOME PROMISE BUT YOU GET THAT I KNOW I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE FEELING WITH MOST OF THE MOVIE. PURCHASED FOR THE 3D AND IT'S EVEN A MIXED BAG. LONG SHOTS LOOK ARTIFICIAL AND DISTRACT. SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE NOT SO SPECIAL, HAVE THE TV MOVIE OR I MADE IT ON MY MAC LOOK. IT'S OK IF U DON'T EXPECT MUCH, SO GO IN WITH REALLY LOW EXPECTATIONS AND YOU GET WHAT YOU CAME FOR."
2,Better if its free than to Pay for it,"The story has potential, but never took off in the movie. The acting was not great and the movie just has too many sterotypes in it that makes it lose any credibility. I was disappointed watching this in the theaters. Better to watch it on cable than to pay for it."
1,The Darkest Hour.,"All good with the Seller, no problem there. but the movie we watched last night and it sucked, terrible movie, story wise, 3D wise was fine, they just needed to put in more action, actually, our company fell asleep on the couch and it took everything we had to sit thru the movie and watch it awww it was an awful movie!"
1,Have a Fluffy Pillow Handy While Watching,"36 hours have passed since I watched The Darkest Hour and I am still trying to find something decent to say about this movie; unfortunately I can not. The beginning of the movie kinda reveals the thrill level of the entire movie-- boring. At first, I thought perhaps it might be like Cloverfield (which was, surprisingly, a good sci fi movie, slow start, great finish) but it was not. If you do not mind watching a movie with low budget special effects, tons of unanswered questions, and rather average to poor actors, this movie is for you; however while watching, I suggest you sit comfortably and have a fluffy pillow handy cause your gonna need it."
2,Weak everything,"This film was a terrible disappointment, mainly as I expected much more than what it was.The story itself is probably passable for a movie. Some Americans in Moscow are caught up with aliens invading Earth for its mineral. Nothing terribly original in the story. Although I thought some of the lines of dialogue were interesting.So it is all up to the characterization, acting and the filming to make the movie something. Unfortunately, nothing like this happened. I did not think any of the characters were particularly interesting. The acting was poor as was the filming."
1,One of the worst 3D movies released to-date,"I like 3D and have watched the majority of 3D movies available on bluray. This one is one of the worst released to-date. The only positive things I can say is that its computer graphics is well made (although it lacks 3D focus), and that the Russians are not shown as morons or as enemies. Everything else in the movie is bad. The plot is primitive and details are not too believable (especially technical details). Acting is average at best, if not plain bad. 3D is below average to average, and the worst of all is that extensive computer graphics which the movie is filled with does not take advantage of it. The ending leaves you feel disappointed - it feels like the script writer, who did not have too many novel ideas to begin with, completely ran out of them by the end. With all this, you end up with a sub-par movie with a lot of graphical violence and noise and very little of anything else."
2,Didnt keep my attention,"I have to give it to them, the action was good at the beginning of the movie. But they didn't keep me interested. I don't know if it was the story line or what. I started going to sleep before I got half way in the movie. I hate that because I thought this was going yo be a great movie. :-("
1,Complete and utter garbage,"I enjoy a good post-apocalyptic sci-fi flick. The key in that phrase is ""good."" This one is garbage--nothing unique in a niche of the genre that is growing a little tired (the post-apocalyptic stuff). This wants to be a nuanced Independence Day, but it's nothing even close--forgettable characters, forgettable aliens, nothing compelling about the plot, and cheesy dialogue at every corner. The story revolves around a hopeless trudge through a alien-infested wasteland, and that's exactly what I felt like I'd accomplished when the credits rolled."
2,The Darkest Hour,Was surprising and good but could have used a little more suspense and action to keep the people inthralled and more attached. But is an ok watch.The Darkest Hour
2,not very exciting,"well this movie we thought might be a good one to add to our 3D collection--- Sorry but we will probably never watch this again-- It is not exciting and the dvd had some delays during the 3D version- Save your money and just rent it,if you have to see it."
2,dont waste your time,This movie was only ok. It does not have an ending!!! leaves you hanging and wondering why they would make a movie that is unresolved.
2,This has been done so many times,"The movie ""The Darkest Hour"" is a new movie on an old subject. Aliens come down to take over the world and get beat.The acting was good and not as fake as other movies on the same subject. I watched it through Amazon Instant Videos but did not buy the DVD or Blueray.I know there will be some people who will have a better opinion on this movie but it was not one that I would want to have around all the time."
2,The Darkest Hour (Blu-ray 3D) was a disappointment,"The Darkest Hour (Blu-ray 3D) was a disappointment. Even my husband, who was REALLY looking forward to this release, only rated it three out of five. I would definitely recommend you simply rent this one!"
3,I wish,It's getting harder and harder to find movies that are original and good at the same time. This one is a different look of how things may turn out one day... probably not though. It was difficult at times to stay focused on the movie wondering about what else might be going on... but if you are really bored and nothing else is on tv this movie is barely a good replacement. Rent at your own risk.
4,stranger than fiction.,"I looked for this title for years after reading Georgette Heyer's take on it. She was amazingly close to the events as Harry wrote them, just added more sentiment. I thought it interesting to read both. I found my copy online, at The Naval and Military Press, based in the UK."
1,Choking Hazard,I just received this in the mail and the first thing I noticed was wooden hands attached to the body with string. Children will chew these little wooden balls and am worried they may break off in my babies mouth. I am returning the item. I think the toy is adorable but am not willing to risk it.
3,Good for teething?,"My son loved this toy when he was around 3-7 months. He chewed on it constantly when he was teething. I'm pretty sure Haba toys are non-toxic, but the paint does wear off pretty quickly with a lot of use."
1,Choking hazard,"This mouse is adorable and my 6 month old daughter loved to play with it and suck on the ears and hands. I was concerned about the ball hands possibly falling off (the string holding them on doesn't come through the other side). After about six weeks of use, the hand/ball fell off when I tugged on it to see how it was holding up. Please note that I did not pull on it hard--just a gentle tug.Haba has a great reputation, but I see here on Amazon that someone else (out of the 4 existing reviews) had the same experience. Please don't let your baby play with this mouse."
2,Its cute but not sure if its worth the price,I got this toy after reading such good reviews about this toy.Its cute but watch out..its really really small.I dont know why I didnt see the dimensions before ordering it.My daughter seems to enjoy it for couple minutes..maybe she is too young for it..(she is 3 months).But this doesnt seem to hold her attention for too long.The clicking sound is good but somehow for the price this toy doesnt seem worth it.I have some other HABA toys like the beetle and Kreigling and they are so much more value for money as she enjoys them.
2,"Cute, but not a favorite..","Very cute, but my son is just not interested which is fine by me considering the balled hands could fall off if pulled and become a choking hazard. I'll stick to stuffed haba toys."
5,Excellent Starter Video,"For anyone with no prior sailing experience, this is a great place to start. I didn't know a thing about sailing and now I'm tacking and turning and using all the lingo as I go. I learned a great deal from this. Thanks."
1,don't bother with this book,"I can only say to those who gave this book high reviews and mentioned the excellent writing--""you have got to be kidding!"" I have never started a book that I haven't finished, but I was sorely tempted by this one. The killer was obvious the moment he was introduced, while other characters appeared only as an artificial attempt to provide some alternatives. Sense of place and other atmospherics were straight out of a how to write a mystery text. I will definitely keep track of reviews by people who loved this book, and avoid their favorites in the future. This book was a total waste for me, and I got it from the library."
4,Motorhead-Support Them!,"They keep churning out solid album after solid album! I personally like 'Snake bite love' better, but this is another good effort! Typical Motorhead, you won't be tricked or surprized by this disc (which is a good thing)! The production doesn't sound as powerful as it should, hence the point deduction! But to sum it all up-Lemmy rules!!!!!"
3,SAME OL' STILL GREAT!,"MOTORHEAD is like an old pair of ripped up faded jeans that you can't part with for anything. Lemmy and his boys always soundthe same (ala AC/DC)but that is a GREAT sound! Guitar; bass and drums, Lemmy's gravely vocals equal true heavy-metal. It's great to hear the Head is still rolling in the new millenium! Up the irons!"
5,We are Motorhead is another classic,"I loved this Album! It is Motorhead times 1000-bad ass drumming and riffage,trademark Lemmy vocals and great songwriting."
1,A Little Dissapointed!!,I thought this would be just like my old iaudio U2. In a lot of ways it is but more cheaply designed. It's a great little MP3 player. The only and main complaint I have is the shuffle feature. It won't allow you to shuffle only one folder. It shuffles the ENTIRE drive!! If you are far sided you'll want to stay away all together. The text and symbols are VERY small. I was really hoping to give this thing a good review. Honestly. I was even willing to give Trekstor the benefit of the doubt and upgrade firmware from their site BUT THERE IS NO FIRMWARE UPDATE!!! My advice is to stay away and pay a little more for a nice Cowon product. This is gonna be packed up and shipped back. Sorry Trekstor I tried.
1,TrekStor i.Beat sweez does not work,"I ordered this device looking for something small for the gym and easy to use. I was able to load music on the device, but it did not turn on. It looked like something was wrong with it when I opened the package as the two large silver plastic pieces were slightly separated. I emailed the company and they wrote back saying the player was broken. I would NOT recommend buying this mp3 player."
3,"lots of space, but slow access","The Transcend JetFlash 2A - USB flash drive - 8 GB is nice for space, but I found it particularly slow. I am not using it for disc thrashing tasks like huge graphic editting or video editting or anything. I was keeping hundreds of mp3's on it for loading from one computer to another. I was surprised how slow it was with just 20 or 30 mp3 files. It's notably slower than smaller 2G drives I have. If all you need is storage, its a nice tool, but if you are at all concerned about speed, I would looke for something with better transfer performance than this."
1,Piece of junk,"Used this 8 times over the past 5 months. Ninth time, it dies. Cannot read drive. Piece of junk. I have had trouble with this before and had to format it twice (FAT/FAT32). And now when I need to access the drive, I cannot access the drive. Piece of junk. Do yourself a favor and buy the Kingston DataTraveler II Plus. You'll thank yourself in the morning. Did I mention this is a piece of junk!"
1,worst product of the century,"I brought this for a long flight about 12 hours flight and I'm using a creative zen vision:M. This thing is useless. wasted my money! I will not recommend anyone to buy this worthless electronic. I put 2 AAA battery to see if that works and still no charge. I put it into the ear phone plug and it do hold a charge, but it doesn't charge any devices! Save your money! buy a portable charger is better!"
3,Good Reference But BE CAREFUL!,"This book has been a handy reference for us as my son just started using an insulin pump BUT... there is a dangerous error on the cookie page where they list the number of carbohydrates in ONE OREO as 33. The correct number is 8. My son ate three at a picnic recently, and if we had given him insulin to match 99 carbs instead of 24 we would have landed in the emergency room! Fortunately I noticed that listed right below the Oreo entry were entries for Fudge Covered Oreo and Double Stuff Oreo, both of which showed under 10 carbs. Lucky for us it was me doing the looking up, instead of a grandparent or other caregiver who might have simply followed the printed guideline! This misprint is a DANGEROUS error, and makes me question and check everything else I look up."
4,The Carbohydrate Addict's Carbohydrate Counter,"This book is a wonderful, quick reference for anyone seeking to control their carbohydrate intake. It briefly explains the difference between complex & simple carbohydrates, and guides you through a ""high/low"" gram chart. It's small enough to use as a pocket guide, and the alphabetical lists of foods makes it easy to find most foods, whether dining in, or eating out."
1,Disappointed,"I have used ""The Carbohydrate Addict's GRAM COUNTER"" for years and decided to get a new copy. The GRAM COUNTER has information on calories, carbs, fats and trigger foods. I ordered ""The Carbohydrate Addict's CARBOHYDRATE COUNTER"" and was very disappointed to find that it has only carbohydrate information. Now you have to purchase three books to get the same information that the 1995 version gave you for half the price."
4,Great diet,1 year and 60 pounds ago...this book changed my life.This really has helped when I'm out and have no clue what I can eat.
5,Inspirational and Thought-Provoking,"A Bitter Rose is a wonderful book. The author has an eloquent style of writing that made reading this book so pleasurable. This book is inspirational and illustrated how families can stay together in spite of obstacles. This thought-provoking story also shows how important it is to look past tragedies and to always remember that God has a plan for us all.The author put her heart and soul into making this novel an inspirational and heart-warming story. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. I look forward to reading more books written by this author. This author is a wonderful and gifted writer and I thoroughly enjoyed how she made the characters come alive in A Bitter Rose."
5,Goofy,Granson gift...he is 7...loves the Goofy DVD's. Fun to share the Goofy character with your Grandson...some things don't change...Goofy is still great!
4,"Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 7","A fine collection of Disney cartoons, including Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and Pluto. Fun for the whole family."
5,1960's Classic,"It is good to see this 1960's classic available onceagain,at such a reasonable price. Keep up the goodwork Cambridge Press!"
4,Caddy Manual,"I didn't realize it was a photo copy of an original manual, some text is hidden in the binding, but it should serve its purpose."
1,1 star is 3/4 of a star too much,"This cd is an inexcusable rip-off. Donna's voice has been ineffectually brought forward from deep in the background. The writing and musical performance is decicedly amateuristic . If you love her music as I do,please don't insult her by purchasing this piece of junk."
1,"For the diehard Donna fan only, please!","I'm what you might actually call an avid Donna fan, but this Cd ... BIG TIME! Aside from the horrible sound quality, it's absolutely not the Donna we all know and love at all. Some of her earlier work - albums like ""Four Seasons of Love"" and ""Love to Love you Baby"" are leaps and bounds better than this bizarre experience that will leave any listener enveloped in a harrowing cloud of nostalgic misery. It's not even an iota of what disco was, became and would want to become. Alright, it might look good on the shelf with your other Donna collections, but that's about all it will be worth. I couldn't even finish listening to the album. What an embarassingly bad paparazzi for a diva-""anything for a buck"" the producers must have thought! It's the English tabloid's version of Donna's exquisite talent, and with three 2000 remixes to boot!"
5,Awesome!,"This is a must-have CD...it is truly exhiliarating. For those of you die-hard Donna Summer fans and those of you trans/progressive-house fans, this album offers a blend of the melodious diva's vocals mixed with fresh beats to ultimately become prospective house anthems...get it while it's out...this is sure to go out of stock soon once the word gets passed on."
3,Different color from the one displayed on the web,I was disappointed with the color. I thought I was buying a burgundy one but it turned out to be RED when I received it!!!
3,"Fake, Made in china",While the product seems to work fine for now. It does seem a little flimsy. It is a Chinese knockoff. Go somewhere else if you are looking for the original product.
1,Chinese Copy - Garbage,"I bought this because I used to wait tables and loved the Pulltap's corkscrew that I had. It didn't take long to figure out that this is a cheap Chinese copy.1) The foil cutter is dull (even when brand new), it works but very poorly.2) The worm isn't teflon, but it is painted to be the same color, and squeaks excessively.3) The boot doesn't carry the engraved Pulltap's logo.Cheap Chinese copies of the Pulltap's corkscrew give Pulltap's a bad name. If you want a proper Pulltap's corkscrew this isn't it, pay a few dollars more, get the one made by Pulltap's in Spain."
5,Great,Great corkscrew and enjoy using it. Had one when I was a server in college and now have in my home now.
1,Not a real Pulltap,"I have owned three Pulltaps brand double-hinged wine tools before waiting tables and thought I would be purchasing a ""real"" Pulltaps tool. From years of handling the devices, I know that this one is significantly lighter (because the body is made of plastic instead of metal). What's worst is that the bottom portion below the hinge doesn't move... which is the whole point! It also doesn't say ""Pulltaps"" in cursive across the top. This is a cheap imitation of a quality tool that isn't that expensive in the first place!"
1,Corkscrew is not well designed,"I own another waiters corkscrew of another brand so I have a valid comparsion.First: the knife that is part of Pultap corkscrew just does not remove the foil very well from the top of the wine bottle. It is useless. I have to use a separate small knife for the job.Second: The screw part of the corkscrew is very difficult to remove from the recess in the handle. I have to use the same knife to extend it out that I used to remove the foil.Third:For some reason this corkscrew seems to break the cork during extraction leaving a piece in the neck.And finally, the double hinging does work but its usefullness is over-rated."
1,Fraud,"I had seen the other reviews complaining about this and other corkscrews on Amazon. I ordered this corkscrew after calling Amazon's customer support to verify this was, in fact, a Pulltap corkscrew.But it is not, it is a poorly constructed knock-off. Sadface."
2,Poor Imitation,"These are NOT the high quality PULLTAP'S CORKSCREW. They were stiff and not the product shown. Their advertisement shows and states they are Pulltap's, but that's not what you get. I ordered 4 and sent them all back. They didn't even have the Pulltap's name on them. I replaced them with the true Pulltap's from Spain, like the one I have been using for years. These were for gifting, mine's still great. Amazon did well in getting the better product to me in a quick manner."
3,Works well but is a knock off,"It is a good corkscrew, but I seem unable to find a genuine Pulltap. Says nothing about being a copy. I feel the originator of a product should be the one to sell it. Oh well. But it does work."
2,Bait and Switch,"Ordered the Wine Enthusiast Pulltap thinking it was an original Pulltex because the product description matched the description on the Wine Enthusiast's website. However, we received a poor imitation from Tapp Collection Inc.; which we promptly returned."
1,garbage,"I was a waitress for five years, using wine keys on a daily basis, and I never encountered a piece of trash such as this. After owning it for two months the first of the steps bent and the hinge of the bottle opener came loose. I would love to return it but I am attempting to do so four days past the allotted time frame. Word to the wise, if you purchase, and are unhappy with the product, be sure and return it within 60 days. Also, apparently, open no more than seven bottles of wine ever in the product's lifetime. If it were possible to give zero stars I would do so."
2,Don't think it's actually a Pulltap's,"Corkscrew appears to be Pulltap's style, but is not actually a Pulltap's. Still works well enough, but not equal in quality to the Pulltap's I've owned in the past."
1,It's a fake.,"Looks like a Pulltap, but doesn't say Pulltap on it anywhere. Doesn't work as well as a Pulltap either. More difficult to use and hurts my hand. My old Pulltap was easy and comfortable. Very disappointing. If you advertise as a ""Pulltap"" then it should BE a Pulltap!"
1,"Very cheaply made, can't do the job!",Don't buy this product. The tip of the cork screw is too dull to dig into cork and the handle is cheap plastic.
1,This appears to be a copy of a Pultap corkscrew,"This product does not include the name 'Pulltap' on it as official Pulltap corkscrews do. It is also flimsy, has rough edges on the metal parts and doesn't work very well (the screw itself is off center). It is obviously a 'knockoff'. Spend a few more dollars and buy the real thing. Unfortunately, it will cost me more than it's worth to return it."
3,Good pulltap but....,It doesn't seem to be holding up as well as other original Pulltaps that I have owned. I wonder if there is better product than this.
1,Fraud,"I have a genuine Pulltap that I love. This one is a fake and isn't nearly as nice. All the hinges and pivots are stiff and hard to move. Hoping it breaks in and loosens up a little bit.For $8 it's still much better than a standard single-hinge corkscrew, but it shouldn't be listed as a Pulltap."
3,Good but not great,"Got the Pulltap's Double hinged Corkscrew and was mildly disappointed that the hinge does not bend at least 45 degrees. It barely flexes enough to allow the cork to rise without rubbing against it. Other more expensive models I have had did flex more than enough to let the cork be extracted freely and without any friction. However, for the price it is what it is, and works most of the time."
1,Double-hinged waiter's corkscrew,This item is terrible. The end of the corkscrew is facing the wrong direction for proper use. It is also not coated as suggested in the photo in the ad. The corkscrew is also quite loose upon arrival. I would expect a new corkscrew to have a tight feel to it. It feels like an old corkscrew that has become loose due to excessive use. This item is flimsy and weak and I would not recommend it to professional food and wine servers.
1,This pull is junk!,"I have one that looks like this (in the pictures) and needed at add to an order to make the free shipping. Seemed like a good idea to have a spare. The first cork to be pulled the screw started to actually unwind the steel was so soft. Hardly a bargain to open one bottle of wine. Don't waste your money, this thing is plain junk."
2,flowery rifles?,"what is with the name? Who came first, Velvet Revolver or crystal pistol? Any relation to the sex pistols? or is this a supergroup that combines members from the crystal method and the sex pistols? I will have to check that out, in the meantime this music is nothing to write home about, unless you are still salivating over the Jackyl Cassette you got for a present back in 1994."
1,Doesn't dissolve properly,"I usually use the All Free & Clear liquid detergent, but they didn't have that available on Amazon, so I decided to try the powder version of same. It does NOT dissolve well and I now have three extra boxes sitting in my laundry room! The only time I can use it is when I'm washing stuff in HOT water and have time to let the water run so it can dissolve before I put the laundry in. I had to go and buy liquid detergent at the store last weekend so I could do laundry!"
3,Does not dissolve in cold water,"Bought this to use for our baby's clothes. Most baby clothes require a cold wash, though, and not all of the detergent breaks down in cold water (at least not in _soft_ cold water). That means that several items are always full of detergent granules that are sticking to them. Works fine in warm and hot washes."
1,Not advertised clearly - a powder soap!,I was surprised to receive a powdered soap product. I thought I'd be getting liquid soap containers. And the packaging is such that you don't know it's powdered soap until the package is opened and too late top return!
4,"Cleans clothes well, no fragrance, but it dissolves too slowly.","I really do like this detergent, but there is one reason I took off 1 star. It cleans very well and there is no fragrance to linger on anything, but when I fill the washer and add the detergent it takes FOREVER for it to dissolve! When I clean the washer filter I can feel a bit of 'soapy' slickness in the remains and I also noticed the little filter holes get clogged way too easily. I even thought about mixing the powder with hot water in a jar to see if it would work any better, but haven't done it yet. And, would it ever dissolve if using cold water to wash? This problem needs to be addressed. I've never had this problem with other powder-type laundry detergent so I know it's not the water or my washing machine. Any other people have this problem?"
2,Not great with stains,This didn't really do a good job of lifting stains on clothes. Switching back to Tide
5,best detergent,"I had to buy this on Amazon because I can't find it in the stores. It's available as a liquid in stores, but liquid detergents are just way too messy. This product does a great cleaning job and is easy on sensitive skin. I also buy it for my elderly parents for their sensitive skin. Contrary to other reviews that say it won't dissolve in cold water, I find that it works in any water temperature & I use only cold water in the summer. Wish this product were easier to find."
5,Excellent Washing Detergent,I have previously searched for this item in many stores and it is not available. This product was recommended by our Doctor to prevent some allegeries and itching. We have used this product for at least 2 years and hope to continue. I will have to make our washing detergent without scents if this product is not available. I have been told that this is a viable option.
4,"Does a good job, but.......","I like this product, with one exception. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. It doesn't dissolve well in cold water wash (we have soft water). I run warm water, add detergent and swish before adding the clothes. As this is an extra step, I think I prefer the liquid Free Clear product better. It does seem to be Allergen free as I have two folks in my home with sensitive skin and allergies and they have had no detergent reaction to their skin."
3,DOES NOT DISSOLVE VERY WELL...,"A bargin for the price, however, it does not dissovle very well. I had to use less, not sure how this impacted my clothes getting cleaned."
4,Too Small,"I love ALL, however, maybe I read it wrong when I ordered this. When I received the items the boxes were so small. I only purchased these thinking I was getting much larger boxes. Well it on me not the company because I did not read the dimensions and measurements to know the actually size of these items. Overall, ALL is a good soap detergent so needless to say it gets my clothes clean and it good."
1,I should have read the small print,I bought this football to play with the kids I work with. I bought it at the store and missed the label that read for right handed throwers only. I am left handed and although I tried cannot make the counter spin. I think it stinks that they make this football for only some of the consumers.
3,Firestarter,This book was thrilling. I love the way that it kept you on your toes no matter what was happening. I couldn't wait to find out what happened.
1,Please please proofread!!,"I enjoyed the story...however, with all of the bizarre typos throughout the Kindle version, I found it completely distracting. I finally gave up. I guess I'll have to read the book...what a waste..."
5,5 stars for enjoyable reading,"I couldn't put this book down. It is very fast-paced and has interesting and exciting characters. I'm a King fan, but I enjoy some of his books much more than others. Firestarter is near the top of my list of his shorter novels, its just so readible, no trudging through long sections of boring histories which distract from the tale like some of his longer works. This one is pure story.The book starts out with Charlie and her dad on the run, which starts you off right away interested."
4,"LET ""FIRESTARTER"" CONSUME YOU IN ITS FLAMES...","Charlie will win your heart... She will also win your soul as she takes to the fiery world of ""Firestarter"". King has created the absolute demon-child under the sweetness of innocence. Now burn and enjoy the flames of death with Charlie."
3,Definately not King's best book!,"I'd like to start by saying, this is not a book to read if you are a first time reader of King's novels. It starts off really slow and gives you the impression that he isn't a good writer at all. Once I actually got into the book I found it to be interesting, but ""The Shop"" just isn't realistic enough to keep me into the story. I gave this book a 6 because personally, I don't believe King put forth total effort into his writing."
3,"mispelled words, punctuation off",I enjoyed the book thoughroughly but the content had a ton of grammatical errors. now im no english buff myself but I figured that the author probably didnt make these mistakes so at some point the content was tampered with.
5,Try this one!,"This was the 3rd King book I read, and definitely one of the best! The plot of the book is very unique, and King holds your attention with assorted dilemmas of all sizes. This book will get and keep your attention throughtout the entire course. Perhaps the best element of this story is the true wonder it will bring. You'll ask yourself questions about Charlie and her father, this book will have you involved!If you enjoyed King's other work, or if you just like great characters and conflicts, this is a great book for you!"
5,Amazin' story! You can't miss this one!,"Although I read the book in another language, the translation was wonderful and the story remaind! While readin' your hands are gettin' warm from the girl. I don't know how Stephen King keeps makin' up these stories, but they remain all splendid! Recommended aspecially for YOU!!!"
4,A Satisfying Read. . .,"I really enjoyed this book. It was not the first book I read by King, and maybe that's why I didn't give it a 10. When I read this, I had already had a taste of some of some of his other works, which are also incredible. It's not a particularly long book, but it is done perfectly. The story is great, it keeps your interest. But I have read better books by King. This book had some slow spots, but if you're looking for a good, quick, satisfying read, then this is the book."
1,Hated the writing and eventually gave up.,"I absolutely hated the writing in this book. It's one of Stephen King's earlier novels and I think it's not one of his best written books. I look forward to his later books, but this will probably be the last of his earlier books I read. In 'On Writing,"" King says that the books written earlier in his career are the ones he's embarrassed by and after reading Firestarter I can understand why. I think the concept is great, but the writing killed it for me. I got about halfway through the book before I gave up."
2,"Firestarter is boring in some parts, and dumb in others.",Firestarter is one of King's worst books. It is horrible from beginning to end
2,Slow paced,The first 3/4 of this book are really slow. It took me a while to get into it. The ending is good so it made it worthwhile.
3,Overall letter grade=C+,"This is King beating the paranormal world to death. I can imagine his mind working: ""Well I've done the telekinesis thing(Carrie), the telepathy thing(The Shining), and the clairvoyant thing(The Dead Zone). What's left? Why pyrokinesis, of course!"" Yeah, this is about a girl who can start fires and it really doesn't work. While in the previously named books, the psychic ability is there to enhance the telling of the tale, in this book it is the focus. The result is a weaker novel. It's not real bad, but it isn't that good either."
2,Classic King Marred With Typos,"This review is not reflective of King's story which is great, but for the Kindle edition.I have never read a book so marred with typos before. I am not sure if the original source materials used to capture the Kindle edition contain these errors but I feel as if I am reading an unproofed manuscript or the OCR scan was not looked at. There are spelling mistakes, misplaced words and characters switched, like ""1"" used instead of ""I"" (1F).If it happened once or twice, I wouldn't write this review. However the amount of typos really detracts and pulls me out of King's universe. Very frustrating to read. Save yourself some trouble and skip this one for the Kindle."
5,Review - Firestarter,"This book has to be amongst my favoirte Stephen King books. The book is a great read, is phenominal and fast paced. You will not be able to put this book down and it will make you want to read more and more of Stephen Kings books.The story follows a girl and her father both who have mysterious powers. They were both made CIA experiments and they escaped from the facility. The CIA relentlessly chases them across the United States hoping to harness their power.. especially hers.This is a great book, there is tons of action, blowing crap up, setting crap on fire, and just general mayhem. The way the book is written makes you want to keep reading. Since this book is so exciting you will be done with it in probably 2 days or less. Also, the ending is explosive!! Definately buy this book, horror and sci fi fans of Stephen King alike will love it."
4,Classic Stephen King but Kindle book is full of typos,"This is a classic Stephen King novel and in my opinion, one of his best, along with The Dead Zone and The Stand. As others have noted, however, the Kindle version is full of typos, and it really diminishes the reading experience, as interpreting the typos breaks the reading flow. For example, there is a character in the book named Al... except in the Kindle version he is usually referred to as ""A 1"". Annoying.I read a lot of self published and public domain stuff on Kindle, and both of those types of ebooks are full of typos and formatting errors. The Firestarter problems are the worse I've seen, and that's particularly disappointing in a Stephen King book. King has been a big supporter of alternate format books (and ""UR"" was a great read on and about the Kindle) so you'd think his Kindle books would be better quality. Four and half stars for King's writing, and a negative star for the formatting."
3,good story but boring the way it was written,"This is the weakest story i've read from Stephen King. Although, the idea is good but it drags you much through boring episodes... Just as said above, good to be read on rainy days."
5,this is the best book in the world,"this book is never boring, and always keeps you holding your breath. once you read it you will spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, hoping no one is following you, or that you won't get off the bus, come home and find someone dead. stephen king is without a doubt, a genius, no author can compare to him, and this book proves it."
4,Like fine wine: addictive,"I've read almost all of King's books and this one kept being on the ""I just can't seem to find"" list, until recently. I enjoyed it very much 'cos it's classic King: fast, filled with suspense and a bombastic climax. I was surprised to find some very touching stuff in ""Firestarter"", like the relationship between Andy and Charlie, but most of all Andy's feelings towards his dead wife; it's very heartbreaking and in some ways better than quite a lot of pages in ""Bag Of Bones"". Knowing well enough about the continuity in all King's novels I can only wonder if there's information about what happened with Charlie in any of them... Like when we found out that Thad Beaumont died, in the pages of ""Insomia"". I haven't seen the film, but I bet it's dissapointing. A great book."
5,Oldie but a goodie!,An oldie but one I had not yet read. I remember the movie but reading it is always so much more fun. I love King's stories...the characters are so vivid and scene is always so well set. Just losing myself in these books is always a pleasure.
4,Wonderfully entertaining!,"I very much enjoyed this book. The characters were in depth but not so much as to lose your focus on the story. The descriptions of events were excellent and story plot was not lost on needless details. A very interesting and attention grabbing plot. Suspenseful as King always deliversIf you enjoy the ""supernatural"" types of happenings and psychic type readings, you will love this book. The only complaint I had were the numerous typos throughout the book."
4,More like 4 1/2 stars.....,"If you are a King fan you will absolutely love this book. It is a very interesting story line of a government experiment that went bad. It made me really think that there is probably stuff like this that takes place more often than we think. It is full of action and the descriptions make you feel like you are actually there watching this happen. As the reader you will really feel for Charlie and the decisions that she is faced with at such a young age. King really captures the essence of a eight/nine year old's torn mind of not wanting to hurt anybody yet not wanting her or her father to get hurt as well. The character of John Rainbird I also found to be interesting yet complex... I do not want to give too much away, so just read it! The way the book ended also left you with your imagination to play out with what you thought would happen next."
4,Typo's,Firestarter is the only King book that I hadn't read yet. I've seen the movie many times but the book is so much better. It's classic King; engrossing from the very beginning. But the Typo's on the Kindle version are just terrible. I'm finding one on just about every page and it's really becoming distracting!
3,Don't buy Kindle edition,"Its a nice story, but the number of typos and mis-spellings in the Kindle edition is enormous. What did no one run a spell check on this? I want my money back."
1,Inexcusable Typos!,This is a great Stephen King novel; the 1 star is for the endless amount of typos that plague this novel. No need to go in details since previous folks already did a great job on documenting the specifics. I just find it hard to believe that an e-book could be released without a human being reading for quality control.I hope Amazon will look into this book make the corrections and resend a corrected version of this novel to all who have made the purchase - for free.
3,Pretty mediocre for King..,"King always has interesting ideas for his books which is why Ive read just about all of them. The problems with this one include somewhat more tedious detail than he normally uses, making the story go slow at times and extending the book by about 100 pages more than it needed. This story also has more holes in it than is common for King. Im maybe a little too caught up in watching for inconsistencies but the ones in this story, tho often small, bothered me. Too many to mention here but one that got me was the ending. It was obvious that the girl would end up at the Manders' farm yet the Shop, with its super-duper state-of-the-art computer, took 5 months to figure it out. That just seemed absurd.Still, even with all the faults it was fun to read. I would just put it far down on the list of King books I'd recommend, long after Salem's Lot or Shining but still ahead of most other books from authors in this genre."
4,fix spelling and grammar errors !,"Great book , read it probably ten times , but the miss - spelling and grammatical errors made me thinkwho was proofreading this , a nine year old ?? Never had a problem with the dozen or so books I've got onmy kindle but this was really bad . At LEAST a dozen errors - and I haven't finished the book !Helped I have read it before because some of these "" words "" used would have left me mystified."
4,Another Great Story,Good Stuff- Not as long or complicated as many of Steven King's books- but a very good story that features the classic character development that makes King's works so enjoyable.
4,Super Reader,"A secret experiment is designed to produce and enhance psionic powers in the subjects. A father decides that his young daughter has had enough of this, and takes her away, and will sacrifice himself for her if necessary.Then, they are on the run as those running the experiment want their powerful psionic girl back. They learn that messing with pyrokinetics is problematic."
5,One of Stephen Kings finest.,"This book for me was such an enjoyable ride. The main charecter was just a father trying to save his little girl, from an evil government agency trying to exploit her. The Psy powers in the book were really ingenius and well thought out. Stephen King writes about normal people in extreme situations and what they must do to survive. He writes of the soft achilles heel of humanity, our weakest moments and our most heroic times. With some horror thrown in for good measure to keep the story alive. Really though his books are an attempt to stand up against our oppressors wether they be Black suit G-Men ,aliens ,vampires ,classic cars ,ghosts ,or just human nature itself."
5,Very emotional,"'Firestarter' is a great triumph for Stephen King. I felt so sorry for Charlie through out the entire book, and John Rainbird has got to be one of King's best villians."
4,Blazing!!!,"I haven't been reading Stephen King's work for very long, but I really enjoyed this book. It's characters are all very believable and by the end of the story, you wish you were there with Charlie to see the fiery climax. I highly recommend this book to any new or veteran King fans for its action, suspense, and creativity."
3,"good enough, but don't expect anything spectacular","Basically an explanation of doctrine, organization, and equipment of amphibious operations, with precious few details of the actual operations themselves. The value of the book is in its description of the various ships and landing craft, and here the text is matched well with pictures."
2,"Useful, up to a VERY limited point","As a seminary trained theologian I can appreciate the value of reading Daly's book. In its day 'Beyond God the Father' inspired many religious folks to critically engage several of the accepted tenents of Christian theology. But this positive contribution notwithstanding I am afraid the book is finally little more than a self-righteous and self-indulgent tirade. Indeed, rather than engaging in some critical (and historical) thinking of her own -- grappling with fact that many women have been able to buttress their liberation struggles through their Christian faith, Daly assumes that hers is only authentic feminist perspective. This makes for an ultimately tiresome and intellectually unsatisfying read. I wouldn't encourage anyone to avoid this book altogether, but there is certainly more important and creative feminist theology out there."
5,"Stunningly, shockingly brilliant!","Mary Daly has so many devestating insights into the white male mind that I must truly say that this is one of the most fabulous books I have ever come across. A book that challenges assumptions and traditions, a book of *real* philosophy, moving and challenging and courageous. What a wonderful writer and theorist!!!"
5,Your ears will dance like a gypsy,"My absolute fav recording of the Corelli Op 5 Sonatas (and there are many).This is superb Chamber music the nearest thing to actually being there!These three Hungarian artists led by Denes Kovacs, (violin,) Ede Banda (cello) & Janos Sebestyen (harpischord) have turned in an excellent performancethey bring a high degree of understanding, precision and tonal polish. As i was for many years in the professional Audio industry , i know good recordings when i hear them. Even if you have modest equipment you will love this recording."
4,Bertie Higgins is great... Song selection might have been better,"Bertie Higgins is a wonderful singer and his music has some classic lines that won't soon be forgotten. My only problem with this album is that an ""ultimate"" collection should really have his best work on it. This would mean including virtually every song from ""Just Another Day in Paradise"" and ""Pirates & Poets."" This collection omits classics like Leah and Marianna that should have found a place within. Nevertheless, it is a great collection and includes my all time favorites like ""Candledancer"" and ""Pirates & Poets""... and of course, ""Casablanca."""
2,A very average singer,"Bertie Higgins is just a very average singer with a limited vocal range. He only ever had two hits in his career, namely ""Key Largo"" (no.8 Hot 100)and ""Just Another Day In paradise (no.46). For me, the song that really stands out on this album is ""Casablanca"" which I think would have been a hit had it been released as a single. The other tracks are unfortunately quite forgetable. It's remarkable how the record label managed to come out with a two disc ""ultimate"" collection for an artiste with so little success!"
3,Not the best CD,"I bought this CD because I LOVE ""Key Largo"" and wanted to try some more of Bertie Higgins' music. I found out that this is the ONLY song I like, so I should have just bought the single. I gave it three stars because ""Key Largo"" almost makes up for all the bad songs."
5,Tops in Trop Rock,"Many of these cuts are at least a decade old but still sound fresh. The CD has reportedly gone double platinum in the Pacific Rim nations which is unheard of anywhere for a collection CD. If you like tropical rock and realize there is more to it then the Cheeseburger in Paradise guy you should dig The Ultimate Collection. Higgins is still performing,mostly on the west coast, where he and his sons own a movie production company in Burbank, CA.Their latest action flick staring Tom Sizemore should be on a screen near you fairly soon."
2,Holy nerds Batman!,"it was "" ok"". those people had good intentions but could have done everything they were doing without their corney names and costumes.surprised they dont get beat up more."
5,yup yup there going to morph,everyone should get this moive cuz of master legend and mr. xtreme with the xtreme cave you know xtreme ops. after wacthing wacthing this movie you would want to hang out and go out on partol with master legend and join team justice.
3,Interesting view into the lives of real life superheroes,This movie follows several different groups and individuals of real life superheroes. They are trying to fight crime and warn their communities of internal threats.
2,Too Easy,"So far, the most effective Tae Bo workout I have ever done is the original Advanced tape, which I wish I could find on DVD. Mainly because of the intense floor exercises, that workout got me in the best shape ever within a few months. Each Tae Bo workout I have tried since then has been weak in comparison, including this one. If you are a beginner, this is a good workout. However, as another reviewer stated, this is definitely not a challenging workout for intermediate/advanced exercisers."
1,Not for the intermediate/advanced exerciser.,"I'm on maternity leave right now and wanted to get back into working out. I do boot camp type workouts normally, but wanted a little more cardio. I found this DVD and the Get Celebrity Fit - Cardio DVD at Marshalls and decided to try it out. It was too easy, I didn't even break a sweat doing both workouts. It's probably a good workout for beginners, but not for me."
3,Nothing new,"I was extremely excited to get this video after reading the reviews, but was sorely disappointed. I have quite a few TaeBo DVDs and this is the first one that I know I will not use again. There was very little on it that was new. Also, this is the first time that Billy ""annoyed me."" Instead of his usual encouraging words, he says phrases repeatedly just to fill the time."
5,5 star cardio work out (don't be mislead),"I thought this would be a toning working (I was envisioning squats, push ups, etc) but it is a cardio workout, similar to his other tae bo workouts. I am not disappointed though, because I was looking for another cardio workout that is up to par with his latest ""Cardio Inferno""! This video is so much fun! Billy obviously had a great time doing it because he is seen dancing and rapping! He is so motivating, you will want to finish the whole workout and you will have that sweaty exercise high when you are finished! No equipment is needed, and you need only minimal space. 5 stars!"
2,Dissapointed,"I found this DVD to be too similar to TaeBo Cardio. Although he does some dancing moves, he mostly does the same moves he does in TaeBo Cardio with much less explanation and he's moving much faster between moves in this one. I found myself bored within the first 5 minutes. It also seemed like Billy was just playing around a lot and the girl to his left kept having to tell him the right moves. If you're not in shape, this may be challenging for you, but I was dissapointed to find this workout too similar to another one I already own. Also, this is probably me being a nitpick, but Billy uses most of the same people in his Cardio workout, but I found that the outfits they wore in this one were not flattering. It's like the outfits were too small and they made some of the girls look heavier and in not as good shape as they look in the Cardio video."
2,Not so great,"THis is the worst Tae Bo video I've seen and here's why: A. To actually do half the video, you need to have at least 15 feet of open living room space, and who has a living room with no furniture? B. The music is terrible. It is essentially songs that the producers or Billy wrote sung by a machine to a beat background. The lyrics are also all about God and Jesus. Not into that during my workout, but maybe you are. C. The combos are silly and the workout isn't hard. Save your money and pick one of the other videos."
4,Fantastic!!,"I just started this product yesterday, and lemme tell you, it kicks my @$$ !!!! i realize this is graphic, but afterwards,I could have wrung my tshirt out with the amount of sweat :) i love that kind of workout. high-impact, the kind that you know makes you work.Two drawbacks, there is this woman to Billy's right hand side that gets extremely annoying. She keeps shouting... and i felt like i wanted to kick her to make her quiet.ALSOa couple of the combinations he does towards the end are a little challenging to keep up with, but im sure with the more that you do it, the better you will get.Overall, this is a fantastic exercise dvd for those who like to kick some butt and sweat hard!! :-D"
4,Hard Cardio Workout---But Where's the Sculpting?,"I bought this video under the impression that it would contain sculpting exercises. Instead it is all cardio---at a very fast pace. I have been doing Billy's TaeBo tapes for the past 18 months. I can get through his Elite and BootCamp workouts without stopping more than once. I had to stop every 5-8 minutes to catch my breath during this workout. It has some distracting parts where Billy trys to rap and he has the class do some dancing, but I was so busy focusing on doing the exercises at the super fast pace that it didn't bother me. My husband, on the other hand, found the rap and dancing to be very funny.Overall, this is a great cardio workout, but if you are looking for strength-training type exercises I recommmend the Elite series (with the weighted bands) or the new Amped series (with the weighted bar)."
3,"ok, needs better instruction","Billy likes to do a move and then explain in after you are already confused about what they are doing and going to fast to get the rhythm... After watching it a few times, you can catch up"
5,Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Get Celebrity Fit - Sculpt,"I am an avid Billy Blanks follower and have pretty much all of this DVDS, this product was another excellent DVD hard core workout which makes you sweat. I ordered in June and it came in July in great condition. I would recommend this to others. There are plenty of kicks and some great new cardio-vascular exercises which are a little different to any of others DVDS. A great quick work out 44 minutes when you are a bit short on time.Excellent DVD would recommend to anybody who enjoys working out to Billy Blanks."
1,Tae-Bo Celebrity Fit,"I was very disappointed with this video. I have several Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos, and know the exercises. However, this one has hip-hop style music and Billy tries to sing (or rap) along with the music, which I find very annoying. He also added a few dance type moves. Maybe he's trying to appeal to a younger, more hip audience. It just doesn't work. I even tried watching it with the volume turned off, but I can't even stand it that way. I think Billy should have stuck with the original style of work-out videos, where he talks us through the exercises, rather than trying to sing and dance. The ""Boot Camp"" series of workouts are better."
2,More Cardio than Sculpt,I have 10+ Billy Blanks DVDs and many of them kick my bum. I found Celebrity Sculpt to move to be more cardio based than sculpting based. In the last 10 minutes it picked up with some fantastic sculpting/resistance moves but it made me feel like the first 35 minutes were wasted. Billy moves rather quickly from one move to the next and doesn't spend enough time to really get your muscles tired in that move. Personally I found myself spending more time trying to keep up and learn the routine than really focusing and burning muscles. I prefer the bootcamp DVDs to this.
3,Jonny B Good (Keith Olson) is Who?!!!,'Perfect Strangers' - A missing cut forCheap Trick fans...The Title is of coursethe Movie Title but guess who K.O. is?He played Bass for Cheap Trick in the '80's...And who says 'Jon doesn't sing?'
1,Book cover good,"The outside of the book was great, but the last three pages had half the page cut off with a scissors. Couldn't finish the story."
3,LENS are Great - PIAA Xtreme H3 Bulbs not so much,Purchased Lights a few months ago and finally installed them on new valance.Bulbs worked great for a few months then one bulb went bad even though the filament is not broken.Ended up replacing with other bulbs as PIAA bulbs are too expensive for the amount of life you get out of them.The Lense are great the bulbs not so much ;0(
5,Nice addition to my Iron Bull Bumper!,I purchased a extreme duty bumper from Iron Bull Bumpers and they recommended these fog lamps to place in the fog lamp holes. I would highly recommend these lights for fog lamp replacement. The wiring harness is a good one although I did not need it because I retained the one off of my 2005 Ford Ranger fog lamp switch. These lights are very high quality and well worth the price. My next purchase will be the lamps for the top of my bumper. These lamps are bright and very sturdy. A must buy for extra lighting plus they look real cool too![...]
3,I'm a former student,"I am going to tell you that W cubed (as we at Lafayette referred to him) was a leader in the struggle to express one's thoughts succinctly and correctly, but, as one who ""passed out"" of Freshman English, where his book was the standard text, I can only speak from my experience with him in a course in English literature. I must say, however, that his teaching did not effect my eventual affection for correct expression as he may have intended. Every so slightly - but perpetually - a patronizing presence, Doctor Watt was an intimidating light on the path to my future: often blinding, infrequently illuminating.Maybe I was too young!The Elements of Style: 50th Anniversary Editionis more to the point!"
1,never used,i think it came quick but the product box was totally smashed and ink was damaged and couldnt be used
3,Decent bargain,"While it's true that there's not as much ink in here as there are in other cartridges, the price for this two-pack is fairly cheap, so when you think about it, you're getting what you paid for. I do wish there was more ink in here, though, but my printer - received several years ago as a gift - needs this type of cartridge, and I really don't wanna buy a new printer when the one I have works fine. For the price, it's not a bad deal."
1,Blasphemy,The ink runs out in less than a month and I barely use my printer. Really low on ink. Avoid if you can.
3,Hewlett Packard HP-92 Twinpack,PROS: It was what I expected. Original consumables from HP. ease of installation. good printing quality so far.CONS: kind of empty cartridge. lets wait till when they last.
5,HP Ink,"Works great for my HP printer. Only complaint is that the inks NEVER print the number of pages that they say they can. Otherwise, they are extremely high quality. Have had a LOT of issues with ""refilled"" cartridges."
4,"AUTHENTIC HP INK, GREAT QUALITY, DOES NOT LAST LONG!","The quality of this ink is superb and it is genuine HP ink. However, all deskjet inks have a short lifespan. I prefer HP inks because the quality is better than the generic."
4,Good enough for my purposes.,"I don't do a huge amount of printing, so have not experienced any running out of ink too quickly. The twinpack was on sale, so it was a pretty good deal. Cheaper than Target, etc. Shipping was fast. All in all, a satisfactory purchase."
2,"Save Your Money, Please!","Do yourself a favor and buy a Canon printer. HP printers are so slow, and their ink took about a week to come, and when it did, i swear, I was printing pages out for college powerpoint lecture notes, and I think i was like on the 20th page, and my ink said low, WHAT!? Horrible. Plus, you pay an arm and a leg!"
1,Low Ink,"I can understand that HP sells their printers at a reduced rate and makes their money on the ink cartridges, but the small amount of ink in this pack is ridiculous. I am going back to re-fills. They're trying to cheat their customers."
2,Not good at all,"HP 92 Black Ink Cartridge in Retail Packaging, Twin Pack (C9512FN140)I received these in April 2012, and I haven't done much printing, and they are already both gone, and it is only June, 12th, 2012, I have to say that I will not be getting from them again. I got some from another seller and they lasted quite awhile, almost 1 year. And it is not the fault of Amazon."
2,A theft,I am very upset with the service life of these cartridges. $ 14 for less than 100 pages seems like a theft. Avoid buying any hp printer that uses these type of cartridges
2,L = Lacking. Love show but CD leaves desire,"I am a great fan of The L word -- and notice the music in every scene. This CD leaves much to be desired. It's really surprising that theme and promotional songs like BREATHE (Melissa Etheridge), CANNONBALL (Damien Rice, and DIFFERENT KIND OF WONDERFUL (Kathy Fisher) are not featured. Also, Portishead would have been great to hear here. Perhaps with season two will come a more complete soundtrack CD."
2,missing the best song!,"this soundtrack is alright. It could be so much better though. I love that they included the Fantcha track, that was a great idea. My favorite song that has appeared on the show by far though is 'Crimson and Clover' by the Velvet Underground. I really missed that one on the cd. I think it would have really added to the feel that they wanted to give to the soundtrack (it worked so well on the show).Oh, well..."
4,Music for relax and be comfortable,I like this CD a lot. I love the music when I saw the L word first season and I bought this CD because of that. I really recommend it if you like jazz and pop music.
4,the l word : lovely!,"i enjoy this album and i also have a preference for joseph arthur ""in the sun"". not to mention marianne faithful but this is not her best song from far.if you love joseph arthur, he's actually touring in the usa...don't miss him, he's spectacular seeing live. a sort of kurt cobain using looping..."
2,Better on TV,"I'm a huge fan of the show and looked forward to the soundtrack. With the exception of just a few songs, the music is better when the actors are on screen. Don't waste your money."
3,Could have been better,"As much as I enjoy the L Word series and am looking forward to Season 2 in January 2005, I was hoping that the soundtrack would feature the best songs from the 14 episodes of the first season. I was disappointed that some of these great tracks, especially the ones from the L'ennui episode, failed to make the cut. One of these tracks should also have been Portishead's ""Roads""."
3,Longing,"The CD like the show leaves you wanting more. In the case of the show that's a good thing. In the case of the CD, like most CDs from movies or TV shows, it's unfortuante. Must be that some artist will not make their work available or it costs to much to include it. Many of the best songs that were featured in the show are not included (Leonard Cohen's I'm Your Man and In My Secret Life; Portishead's Roads; Damien Rice's Cannonball; Liz Phair's Flower; I could go on...). Some songs are on the soundtrack and one wonders why (Frances Faye's Frances and Her Friends). It's not all bad though, I am happy to have Blue Sky, Drivin' You, and So La Camba. A decent effort but it leaves you Longing."
2,One song is great!,I bought the CD for Hallelujah by Rufus Wainright and it is the only song I like on the album.
2,Umm,Very odd compilation of songs from the first season :-|Go for the second season of The L Word soundtrack instead!
4,Please Help,"I am trying to find the name to a song i heard on the L Word a long time ago. Unfortunately I dont know what episode its from but know it goes on during the closing credits.It has words along the lines, ""Shes got a secret lab..."". If anyone knows of this song, it would be a great help to me. Thanks."
4,Eclectic Mix,"A wonderful soundtrack. For those who would like to know about the songs played during the show, visit http://www.thelwordonline.com/listen.shtml"
3,had to be there,"I caution those of you who did not watch the show against purchasing this cd unless you are already familiar w/ the tracks. At least for me, this cd is good b/c it reminds me of my favorite scenes/moments from the show. I'm not sure how I would feel about it had I not been a fan. Just a word of caution."
3,Decent follow up to a hot first album,"On their second CD Welcome II Nextasy, Next gives us more of the sexually charged music they got them a record deal in the first place. Wifey was a huge single in the UK and was some what big in across the ponds in the states. However Next's has their strongest material in ballads and that's apparent on tracks like When We Kiss,Spalsh and Cybersex. Next isn't all about their libdio though as they try to show to love to Hip Hop heads on the tracks Jerk feat. 50 Cent and What U Want feat. Beanie Sigel ."
3,I'd rather wait for what's NEXT from Next...,"Welcome II Nextasy was ""okay."" Of course, ""Wifey"" is the main song featured on this album, but I did like the way they tried to stay inconsistent with their styles to appeal to all listeners. There are SOME pretty dope cuts on this album and Next has taken a huge step away from the Bad Boy style (thank God), but there are also SOME songs on this album that seemed to me like they were just ""fill-ins"" to kill time on their CD to make the album seem longer (example, the last song on the album, which runs over 9 minutes). Welcome II Nextasy wasn't a horrible album, but then again, it wasn't the best. I'd rather wait for what's next from Next."
1,Very Immature CD,"I heard ""Wifey"" and thought the song was great.....bought the CD and found it to be the most childish compilation of music ever...There might be 3 decent songs on the CD....certainly not worth the money. This CD might be ok if I were still 14. Don't play this CD around the kids. These gentleman seem to have talent but could use some decent writers.Save your money for something better"
5,welcome to nextacy,i really enjoy this ablum it gots fast beats and some smooth slow songs. i think there one of the best groups out there .there frist ablum was great but this one is deftanly 5 star quaility !
4,I LIKE IT,"I JUST BOUGHT NEXT'S SOPHMORE CD WELCOME 2 NEXSTACY AND I LIKE IT I'M A REALLY BIG FAN OF NEXT AND I LOVE R.L. IF YOU LIKED THERE FIRST CD YOU'LL LOVE THIS ONE SOME OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE WIFEY, AND WHEN WE KISS . I KNOW ALOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE BUMPIN THIS CD IN THERE CAR THIS SUMMER"
2,...same ol' stuff...same ol' stuff !,"I knew that their 2nd. album was going to be like this,...I freakin' knew it! Too sad, there's no room in the actual RnB panorama for innovation. These guys were a pleasant surprise 3 years ago when they released their 1st album, ""rated next"", but they lost all the freshness that they showed on their debut. The beats are unimaginative, repetitive (you always have the feeling that you hear them before in other songs or groups) and the lyrics turned to be pathetically sexist: ""super sperm! ""...C'mon! Really, a bad album. Don't buy it. Don't fake da funk! Peace. Sergio ROLLERFUNK."
1,stupid,this cd is crazy man what kind of song is that cybersex junk i want your pc lay it on my laptop thas some crazy mess right there i aint hatin im tellin my opinion it jus had me rollin hahahahahahahahahahah i will never stop laughin next if you read this wasup yall i like that wifey song though peace out
4,Next kicks!,"I have the first album and i thought it was great i love it! then i heard their new song ""wifey"" and I think it's adorable! i love next! if u like r&b then this cd is awesome! u will love it! It has a lot of sexual content though! but itz all good!"
5,Welcome II Nextasy...A+,"Well, This long anticipated album from NEXT, Welcome II Nextasy has finally been released,and let me tell you, Its even better than Rated NEXT. Songs like ""When We Kiss"", ""My Everything"", ""Wifey"", and ""Beauty Queen"" show NEXT's real talent. Make sure you get the album! You wont be disapointed! It reminds be a little of Jagged Edge, 112, and Dru Hill....Next has a little bit more ofa provacative image, but not in a bad way, it depends on if you like that R&B/soul/urban hip hop style!"
4,Next Generation Music,"Rap and R&B has always been one to leave me breathless. This is my first time listening to Next. The group consists of three brothers, and on this album there are various artists that are guest appearing. There's nothing else left to say that there is some really good stuff near the end. Next rules! Don't let this one go by."
4,Sweet's Opinion,"I think that this is an excellent album, but then I am very partial to one of the producers name Edward Berkeley (Fingazgoal Production Company.) Right away, I was able to pick out the songs that he produced. My very favorite is ""WIFEY"" because it was written about me! My second favorite is ""SPLASH"" because it is a song that I could have easily written because of my mind frame. Overall, I can't wait to hear their ""NEXT"" album. Thank you Goalfingaz for a job well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SWEET"
1,Next please!,"This CD was nowhere near as good as the first one, I was very disappointed. What is there..like one good song on here (Wifey) and that's not even that great!"
2,Nothing Norman Ever Recorded Comes Close To Spirit In The Sky!,"The single Spirit In The Sky is a total standout in this 2 CD anthology, in fact I rate it as one of the best songs of the 1970s.It's a guitar led hard rock classic, with feedback/reverb to the fore.Very little after that really hits the mark, California Earthquake is maybe the next best and Junior Cadillac is OK.Some songs, including Children Of Paradise and The Eggplant That Ate Chicago, have not stood the test of time well at all.Norman writes all the material here, which dates from the late 1960s to 1972, when it appears he gave up recording to run a farm in Petaluma, California.I would really like to have enjoyed so much more of these tracks, but in the end only Spirit In The Sky is a must have."
1,Wheel locks,"Very disappointed, these locks were supposed to fit my truck, they do not fit it. I consider that pretty sad. I will have to mess with sending the dang things back now."
3,Not very appropriate for males,"Contrary to the suggestion in the introduction, the book was found not to be very helpful for males. It is aimed at anorexic and bulemic females."
4,El Sabio,This is a great CD. Hector Lavoe is a talented artist. It is definitley a buy for the salsa enthusiast.
3,A good starting point,"This book is primarily a ""directory"" on how to measure and then improve equipment maintenance management. Mr Wireman describes the basic methods of maintenance with chapters on the pros and cons of preventative maintenance, RCM, TPM and computerised maintenance managing software. It then describes the performance measures that can be used to effectively manage maintenance. This is a very good book for engineers wanting to improve the maintenance function, but if you are after a handbook on how to set up a PM, RCM or TPM program then this isn't the book you want."
4,Great place to get started,"As others have written, this book is a great start. The sections on each aspect of maintenance activities is broken down clearly. The only problem I had with the book is the lack of detail he sometime had on how a person would try to select the records he mentions in a given KPI. Otherwise if your Maintenance Dept is just starting out to use KPI's to monitor maintenance activities, this book is a great resource to get ideas going on how you want to monitor your department's progress."
5,Death metal rules!!!,"Decapitated dvd is a great look at this bands power, and how brutal this is they were on the ozzfest which is pretty cool. I have never seem them live, this was worth seeing on dvd so fans of deicide and cannibal corpse and a little touch of morbid angle!!"
3,ok..travel log,"would have preferred more info on the actual train stops, ride across Siberia. detailed in spots that he majority of the ""tours"" do not stop at. As an independent traveler, still stopping in off beat places.......would have enjoyed more information.good service"
5,Travel writing advice for the published writer,"This is by far the best travel writing book that I've encountered for the EXPERIENCED writer. So many books about traveling writing or writing/publishing, in general, are targeted to a completely inexperienced audience. This book seemed to focus more on strategic approaches for selling your writing, and not so much on ""how to write a good lead,"" etc. This was a refreshing change. The author's ideas are novel; the book is easy to read; and the reader will gain confidence that travel writing to make some money is not an unrealistic goal."
5,Excellent Product - Amazon NOT Price Competitive,"I like this product greatly. However, I was NOT pleased that Amazon sold it at FULL PRICE.Amazon.com used to be known for having good/discount prices. Recently, I noticed that Amazon.com is now selling many products at top dollar. So, I do NOT shop at Amazon without hesitation anymore. I do further Web searches and compare prices plus shipping costs."
3,A Fine Product If Not a Little Expensive,"The sound quality is, as mentioned, very crisp. You'll find very little bass in this product. There is no adjustable sound on the device and even with my computer's volume up on high the sound hardly carries across the room. The product is also battery operated and goes through a AA battery about once a week. Otherwise, the product is small enough to carry in your pocket and is easily portable."
3,It's ok.,"Shape and quality could use a little work. I purchased this for a Sansa E250 mp3 player and it's as big as the player. After a little while, the 3.5mm jack pulled out of the main unit, a little disappointed, however to be fair, I had been a little rough on the unit as I would just throw the unit and mp3 player in my coat pocket and from there it would get tossed around with my coat."
1,Crap!,"broke right away, crappy product!!! very frustrating, expected it would be a solid product, didn't work to begin with due to feedback and then the piece that connects to ipod or other device just broke. not cool!!!"
5,You might Die,"My first encounter with Redline was in a mini-mart at a gas station. And when I say you might die, I mean it. I was working a patrol security graveyard shift during the Indian Summer in California, only able to get 2 hours of sleep a day because of the heat an a lack of air conditioning in my apartment at the time.After 10 different energy drinks I was still falling asleep at the wheel. It was only that moment of anxiety after I blacked out and ended up 3 miles past where I had intended to go that drove me to try this drink.I only had half of the bottle when I bought it...but it's unlike anything I'd had before or since. I could feel my heart pounding harder, my hands began shaking, irises restricted, the damn thing kicked me from asleep at the wheel to incapable of sleeping for the next 6 hours. I had the other half of the drink before my shift ended. Bad idea. I think I may have had a small heart attack.Most awesome energy drink EVER."
5,Really Gets you booted UP!,This stuff really gets you moving! Im sure some day it will be banned because some idiot will drink a 6 pack & congress will change laws. But hey just drink a half bottle & you will be set to run like Carl Lewis!
5,Best Energy Drink,"By far the best rush from any energy drink I've ever had. Normal energy drinks over the years have really lost their effect on me, and in turn I'd had to resort to drinking more and more to feel energized. The energy shots like 5hr, etc never gave me a rush, they just usually made me feel hot, flush and at times dizzy. These Redlines, though, perk me way up and do it within 10 minutes. For most you really shouldn't drink more than the half bottle that's recommended. Even on that half bottle I feel more energy and stay ""up"" longer than with anything else. I also don't feel a crash, as there's no sugar."
1,Color greatly misrepresented,"I have seen this color online before, and I thought it looked really pretty. I got excited when I found it in an Ulta store awhile ago. My hair is naturally light blonde, which is an ideal color to use this on according to the box. However, I was understandably mortified when my hair finished drying after using this product. The top part of my hair was bright red, and the rest remained mostly the same color as before. I followed all of the instructions, mixed the product well, and left it on for the correct amount of time. There is no reason this should have happened. I had to lighten my hair with lemon juice afterwards to get some of the bright red out. My hair looked absolutely nothing like on the box. Perhaps other women will have better luck with this product than I did. However, after my experience, I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,Storyline good but sexual content not necessary,I bought this for my son to read for a 6th gread book report. Thank goodness we read it together! Never expected the sexual content. He is an avid reader of WWII stories and the rest of the storyline was great depicitng how frightening and difficult it was for this boy to be hunted down and sent to a concentration camp. The narration of his first and subsequent sexual experiences added nothing to the story.
2,Fun and Educational IF you have't see the movie,"A group of us have game night every week, and last week we tried this game. I say tried because we laughed so hard at the game that it almost made up for the senseless / confusing game play. Kind of makes you wonder, if six college graduates can't figure it out! Needless to say, the game is not a keeper :-(It was very disappointing since I am a huge LOTR fan, and love the LOTR Risk. It adds a new strategic spin to Risk, unlike The Two Towers Strategy Board Game, which includes little/no strategy at all."
3,Better off with the video,"This is a documentary about salsa and how Fania innovated this unique sound. The movie delivered very nicely. However, this does not automatically translate into a good music album. The soundtrack has it's good moments, like for example in ""Abran Paso"", but just as you get into the song, it cuts into commentary by Geraldo Rivera. It has great songs, don;t get me wrong, ""Descarga Fania"" and Bobby Cruz on ""Ahora Vengo Yo"" are Fania classics, but you are better either getting the full versions on their respective albums or purchasing the video, which is rather entertaining. Plus, since it is a 2 disc CD my experience in various places says that the price is way too steep for it."
1,I really hated it. I am real sorry I read it.,It's about a redneck kid who hunts snakes and sells them for money. He lives in a swamp and lives like a pioneer.
1,Cloudy download unsuccessful,Was unable to migrate this from the Amazon Cloud to my computer. Amazon should allow straightforward computer downloads without interference from their Cloud product.
1,*Expletive the USA,"On track 13 of this CD album is the song ,titled on the back cover ""USA."" It should have been ""*Expletive the USA."" For eight refrains in four choruses for a total of 32 times ""Destruction sings ""*Expletive the USA."" I can't make out the verses because of the shrieking. Now,I was a fan of band ""Destruction""and owned six CD's by them and had a DVD on order. I am a citizen of the USA and was offended deeply. I returned the CD and threw away the six prior CD's. I cancelled my order of their DVD. I don't understand how other reviewers missed this. Or did they and didn't care. Well I care and have written to several CD vendors and talked to as many people as I can about this outrage. I hope this band disbands soon. Their opinions aren't welcome in this corner of the USA."
1,not recommended,"I purchased this hoping for a more controlled writing experience on my ipad. I hoped the new metal mesh tip would give better screen contact. I was very disappointed. The tip didn't work well on a screen protected ipad (as mine is). Contact was spotty. Most of the time it didn't work at all.The stylus is very light weight. I prefer to have the feel of a real pen.I had also hoped that the tip would be more durable because of the mesh. It felt like there was hardly any substance to the underlaying rubber (or whatever was used)All in all, my experience was the opposite of the advertised ""ultra durable, ultra responsive, smoother glide, increased accuracy"" promised."
4,Good product,It came in a timely fashion and was the perfect Christmas present for a family member! I think he will really enjoy it!
3,Size runs small,"I bought this on clearance expecting it to fit as my daughter wears size 28 in all other swimsuit brands. Not the case - she couldn't even squeeze into it. Its a nice thick suit would be a good training suit, just sizing issue."
1,terrible,i ordered a large swimsuit and guess what? they sent an XS swimsuit. there is no way i will fit into this. 1 star. wouldve been 0 if possible
1,Swimsuit,Size was too small. I ordered the size I have bought in similar suits yet this one was very small. I had to return it.
