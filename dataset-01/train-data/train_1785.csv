1,EXPENSIVE $400+ toner cartridges don't last.,"There are four toner cartridges in this expensive piece of junk. When one of them craps out, try to guess which one!It will cost you over $400 to replace the toner cartridges."
2,Life on Earth,The Amazon-UK has this video available in all of its original length and glory. When will we be so lucky? I bought the abridged version out of despersation - it would be good if I didn't know whwat I was missing.Please release this DVD/Video for the USA.
2,"The Ordinary Was Left In, The Extraordinary Was Left Out","I was very disappointed that the original 11 hour groundbreaking version of this program is not available. This much reduced version wastes time showing the same sort of footage that while important to the story can be seen on many nature programs, for instance; a great deal of time is spent on lions hunting their prey on the African plains, zzzzzz. Almost completely left out are the original version's visits to the world's great fossil sites and the many interesting correlations between fossil species and existing forms that were really what the show was all about. Demand the original!"
3,Why I won't buy this,"This is a good 4hour video but it pales in comparison to the 11 hour original masterpiece.My father is a botanist and I remember sitting with him in rapture as David Attenborough took us on a journey of discovery. I've been waiting for years for the Attenborough series to be released in their original form (preferably on DVD), but for some unexplained reason the BBC haven't managed it yet.My advice, is to keep waiting (and to email the BBC to encourage them to get their act together)."
5,New to David Attenborough? Start here with his evolution of life,"While David Attenborough had already been presenting some programs on zoology in the black & white series `Zoo quest', it is `Life on Earth' that is really the first of his big nature television series works. 13 episodes long the template is based on Clarke's `Civilisation' TV series and would later be adopted by Carl Sagan for `Cosmos'.Life on Earth is about the evolution of life starting with a barren earth and working through the increase of the complexity of life. Each episode ends with the group of organisms evolving into a new type of environment and adapting to produce new traits. The last episode is about humans and human environments.This is one of the finest nature programs ever made. I cannot underestimate its value or recommend it enough. After you have finished watching this, move onto his next series `The Living Planet'."
3,I want the complete version too!,"I saw the original series on PBS. I bought the abbreviated version, but, it only whets my appetite for the complete version."
1,BBC Listen UP!,"IF the BBC put this COMPLETE series on DVD and sold it in a box set with Living Planet and Trials of Life I would buy it in a second. I remember watching it as a boy, I still have the books, and I would love to see the series again and share it with my own child now."
4,Westwood archive book,"This book is very well done with a nice timeless of Ms. Westwood's creations. There are a lot of photos and good information on the collections. Well written. My only objection is that it tends to be a bit ""Artsy"" so a lot of the photos tend not to show the explicit details of the garments that one wants to see due to shadowing, darkness, blurring for effect, etc. But overall, a wonderful resource!"
1,Vivienne Westwood,"The purchase of Vivienne Westwood was a gift for my daughter, currently living in San Francisco, for Christmas. It was one on her wishlist, and she was delighted to receive it some days before Christmas. The process of ordering with Amazon was simple and efficient and affordable. As I live in Australia it was very convenient to order online and the seller was from Conneticutt so postage was not expensive. Posting from Australia to the US is exorbitant for parcels. I was originally intending to buy this book new but as there was not one available the ""mint"" condition of the used book purchased thru Amazon was very satisfactory and actually half the price of a new book. As I haven't personally sighted the book I cannot comment but my daughter is very happy with the content. Question 2 above ............ couldn't seem to fill in the desired rating for some reason, but the rating is ""love it""Will definitely shop with Amazon again. Thanks a lot. MarieAmazon Verified Purchase"
4,The Truth is out there...,"but only Kolchak, known as the Night Stalker because this reporter does his best work at night, wants the public to know it. The cops, the FBI, the city government wants him to drop the idea that a killer, who also seems to drain the bodies of blood, is a vampire. Yet in the end Kolchak will not only prove homself right, but he'll be the person to save Las Vegas! With the help of his girlfriend and her co-workers.Great artwork and its wonderful to see a whole comic book in full color. Just splashes of color all over the pages! While the book looks very slim it holds one full story and has lots of background, details and characters.The only problem I had with this book is the way the binding used up part of the page to attach the pages together. In other words, some sentences and part of the artwork was trapped in the fold and can't be seen. Bummer."
1,Defective DVDs,"Unfortunately I cannot give a decent review for this series. I purchased the series for my spouse last year and he watched the first disc and then never got around to watching the rest of them.Tonight he decided to pop the next disc in -- skipping, pixelated, unplayable.The same problem occurred with the subsequent discs.Of course, since he took so long to watch them, I would image we are SOL so what a waste of money."
3,Wait for Blu Ray,I would say it might be a while but I think this series will come back in hi-def. I bought the Bob Newhart show on DVD and it was a two sided version. Most of the other TV series I have bought are on a one sided DVD and I feel the quality is better. They have extras. It is getting to the point where the standard definition DVDS are like the cheap VHS tapes once the format clearly was on its way out. If you do buy this set now realize that you will have to replace it in the next five to ten years. This was a fun series but for now I will view it either on any of the sites that show classic tv or rent the dvds from Netflix. Susan Silverberg
2,Kind of a rip off,You can buy the entire series for like 15 bucks. (Pardon the pun) Why buy just season 1 for $19.99????
3,"Hokey, yeah, but fun","Not a particularly deep examination of post nuclear earth defending itself from marauding alien empires, but entertaining all the same. Besides, everybody loves Twiggy, beedeebeedeebeep!!!!!"
5,5 stars for Erin Gray!!,"Maybe some episodes are terrible but this series has Erin Gray... and this fact alone, believe me, is enough to justify buying this set. She is, by far, the most beautiful woman I have ever seen (and a good actress too)!!! To have the pleasure of watching her again, like the credit card ad, is priceless... Highly recommended!"
5,Such a great show!,"With Gary Coleman, Julie Newmar, a creepy Space Vampire, a man who can pull his own head off and slain Playmate Dorothy Stratten, how can you go wrong???"
4,"About the episode;""Women in Chains.""","This is a high point in the Canon! It co-stars a very young Jamie Lee Curtis as a convict who can put the finger on the nefarious space pirate, Pantera! Here is what I learned from this episode;1. In the future prison guards will wear leather dresses.2. Androids always take out their frustration on hapless scenery.3. ""Tied to a chair"" is a great look for Erin Gray.4. Squids roam the deserts of the future.5. Finally, while styles of clothing and cars may change, hairstyles will always remain the same, relevant to the time of the episode's filming.In closing, this one has plenty of good Buck. He has to rescue Wilma, fight an indestructible android,capture a space pirate and outwit a diabolical Space Diplomat. And don't forget the Sand Squid."
3,Not the theatrical release,There is at least 1 scene missing. The scene where Buck is shown his apartment food dispensor and entertainment center. I think there is anothe regarding a second landing of his shuttle IIRC.Enjoyable other than that.
1,...uck..odgers....this..dvd....ski....ps....a......l....ot,"I was not surprised to se the other reviews stating that the DVDs skipped on various episodes and chapters. Like many viewers I was so anxious to get into the series I threw them into the player the moment I got my hands on them.....like many I discovered that the dvds are all SNAFU ed!! Disc 1 and 3 in my set refuse to play and I have put them in every thing I have that plays dvds including the x-box and a new PC. Major F* up for Universal after such a good job with the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA discs. I was going to actually re-purchase this series as I have waited for years for it, But after seeing all the SKIP reports I think I will have to wait and see how UNIVERSAL is going to fix this! Lets KEEP UNIVERSAL'S FEET TO THE FIRE On this guys n gals!!!"
3,SURPRISED,"How can they release an entire series onto DVD and not include commentary by Gil Gerard and Erin Gray? When is Universal going to get their heads out of their....well, intergalactic butts and realize this type of pop-culture audience who is going to actually BUY this stuff wants to listen to it? They are insane. MINUS 2 STARS SIMPLY BECAUSE UNIVERSAL IS CLUELESS."
5,That's what I'm talking about.,"This series was awesome. You had the good girl blonde always running around in the tight white outfit, and the evil red-headed space princess in the revealing low-cut gowns. Plus a whole lot of other hot women running around in skimpy outfits.Twiggy was annoying, but man the girls on this show were smoking."
4,Great trip down memory lane,"In my memory Buck Rogers seemed to go on for several years. In fact there were only 2 seasons of the show. It's great to see the episodes again. The actors play it for all it's worth...with their tongues firmly in their cheeks. There's also plenty of tight costumes and 'eye candy' for everyone.The quality of the DVDs are great, although one less star because there are no 'extras', just the episodes.The discs are Region 1, but play on my European multi-regional player just fine."
3,Which version of the pilot do we get?,"Okay, so many are asking why would Universal re-release this set when it is already out in a complete set with season 2? Well maybe they are doing what they did with BSG and making it a full 5.1 surround sound presentation as opposed to the 2.0 stereo mix released in 2004. Or maybe they will finally include the original 96 minute pilot (not the 88 minute theatrical release)with the series (and again a redone 5/1 surround soundtrack) Not much of the details are available as yet but I am hoping that the actual pilot episode will be released. Currently the only way to watch the original pilot episode is to stream it from netflix or wait for some local TV station to run it in syndication, which usually means the 2 part version, complete, but split into 2 parts. Hopefully Universal will provide more details soon."
2,poor quality,Great to see this show on dvd. Unfortunately as other reviewers have noted the quality is suspect. I am not able to play the B sides on 3 of the 5 cds.Hopefully you will get lucky and get one that works!
3,buck rogers a great show but has pronlems,i bought buck rogers and i went thru 4 box setsand discs 4 and 5 wont play at all
4,What Happened to this show?,"When we watched it in the 1970s, I recall all the episode from the (supposed) first season. But when the second season starts, the entire show changes and becomes something I would not watch.Overall the product is good for the first 3 or 4 discs then it goes down hill afterwards."
1,Another Faulty Set,Add my name to the list of people who received disks that would not play. Disk one of this set completely froze up my dvd player and now must be returned.
1,Defective DVD's,"Wanted to play my DVD's the first day I got them to my dismay all DVD's was defective except one. Tried 3 different DVD players. I am returning for refund, will not reorder."
3,"buck is great, but this dvd series is hardly ""complete""","i grew up on this show, yes, i know it was only a couple of seasons, but i watched reruns and ive recorded almost all the episodes off the sci-fi channel or bought the videos at the store, and was disappointed that it was intentionally misleading. there are several episodes which are simply NOT HERE. where is ""Unchained Woman"", or ""Escapre From Wedded Bliss""? they are just not in this boxed set. this was very disappointing as it was advertised as the ""complete"" series. still, the season 2 episodes were worth getting because they are really not shown too often, with the exception of ""Time of the Hawk"" and ""Testimony of a Traitor"". i just wish it had REALLY been the complete series. so, for anyone who considers buying this, just make sure you know what you are getting. all in all, i would probably still buy it, even knowing what i know now."
4,Missing Booklet?,I also did not get a booklet with this product - it has the empty (except for an advertising pamphlet) slot for one but no listing of which episodes are on which disc or side! Annoying - is there supposed to be an insert? It would seem so....
4,Buck is worth the bucks@@@,"If you want a movie with a good storyline,colorful characters and awesome special effects,this video is for you!Astronaut Buck Rogers is sent into space in 1987 and returns to earth 500years late@The earth he knew doesn't esist.Will he asjust?Can he Prove he's not a traitor for the Draconians led by the beautiful Princess Ardala?Will earth defeat the nasty space pirates?Buy and watch this action-packed video to find out.You'll agree Buck is worth every buck!"
4,Buck Rogers in th 25th Century,"HiI Liked to Watched Buck Rogers in the 1980's and thought it was a great series, and I needed to own it in DVD form. I would like to know if anyone had the same problem I had when I bought the Complete Buck Rogers series from Amazon. I was missing all the episodes on side B of all the 5 DVD'S. There was no side B on any of the 5 Disks. Thank You in advance for any of your responses."
3,Way over priced,"I've been waiting for this series to come out on DVD for a long time. I loved watching it as a kid, but they must be out of their mind with a ~$90 list price. I'll be ready to buy it once it drops below $40."
4,25th what?,"Bought it to show my wife one of the shows I use to watch when I was a teenager. Now I know why I liked it so much (girls in tight outfits. Just enjoyable to watch and leave the world behind, to see how they followed the comic strip-Yes there was a comic strip, hard not to laugh at some of it now."
2,I heard about this but ...,"... I hoped I wouldn't encounter it.I love the series, but, product quality seems to have been left behind.We just received it last week, and have only gotten thru the first disc, and already there are two episodes with disc errors; the second & third episode on the second side of the first disc. Second has scrambles in several spots, and third has extremely long 'commercial pauses', like the player can't find the beginning of the next chapter.So much for quality control. Where's the link for customer service?"
3,Buck Rogers in the 25th century,For the most part everything was fine. What I didn't like was that three disks where hot glued into the case
1,*** Beware of a Major Defect ***,"While I am a avid scifi fan, I have gone through two replacements and still do not have a working copy. There is a major defect in Disc 2 - episode 2 Cosmic Whiz Kid. It will not play through.I have e-mailed universal on this and they have yet to reply to me. Amazon has been a blessing to work with and accepted both copies back with no charges to myself"
2,TV Has Certainly Changed,"I was feeling a little nostalgic when I saw this available for download, as I used to watch every episode growing up. Overall, this one is really showing its age with the not-so-stellar acting abilities and a pretty bad script. What seemed ""cool"" from a possible future technology standpoint as a kid looked like something patched together from Radio Shack and Toys 'R Us today. While I did watch the first episode of the pilot all the way through, I did not order any further episodes.My kids thought it was bad, too.If you were a fan of the show growing up, I'd recommend saving your money and time and savor your memories and not burst the bubble by watching this again."
3,Good ole Sci-Fi,"Good for the time it was made and still has entertainment value. Descent price for what ya get, especially if ya love those metallic costumes and lip gloss, hah!"
4,Oldies but goodies.,"After watching the horrible ""Flash Gordan"" series on SciFI, I began to remember my younger years. Buck Rogers was on every week and it was always a good watch. Many people may giigle at the sillyeffects and ham-acting, but let's face it. Compared to soon of the crap you see now adays, this is golden. The real pity of it all is that it lasted only 2 seasons and was just cut without even an ending episode. But then again, that's what they did to most shows back in the late 70s and early 80s."
4,"I loved the series on TV, and glad to have the box set.","I LOVE this series because it is completely hilarious.My favorite part of the show is Twikki because you never know what he is going to say or do next. One of my favorite lines by Twikki is ""I hope you know this violates my warranty.""the quality of the video is VERY clear the clearest images I have ever seen from ANY DVD.Why the four stars? I have two nitpicks about the series.1. All five DVDs are double sided. Double sided DVDs are a real pain to remove without touching one side or the other.2. the box is made from hard plastic, and it is very hard to remove the DVDs from the hard plasticThe first thing I did was put the DVDs in my Targus 160 case that holds 160 CDs or DVDs, then threw the box away.I was not able to see the pilot in a theater, but the video is MUCH better quality than you saw on television."
3,Not as I remembered it.,"Memory! It can play tricks on you. I remembered this series as being better than I thought. Of course, our ability to discriminate between good and bad increases as we get older. I suppose seeing much better shows since helps here. Anyway, Buck is not as good as I remembered it. But it is somewhat fun and the ladies were as attractive as I remembered! :-) But season 2 is just plain unwatchable."
2,bidi bidi we have trouble Buck,"I gave this a 2 star review not because I don't like the series but the way the disks were processed. DVD-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most. I have purchased other universal shows which had less problems. Airwolf, The A Team, ect. The only saving grace is I have a number of dvd players so I have managed to salvage all or most of the BR episodes. Why put all of the episodes on 5 disks? To save money but they charge big bucks for the sets."
4,MISSING FOOTAGE so ONLY 4 Stars,"I only gripe about this set is that the footage from the original movie isn't complete. There were scenes that were edited out including the ending scene where Buck give his big speech agreeing to join the Earth Defense Directorate in order to help them ""restore"" Earth and Humanity. Not to mention a scene where Buck gets his new 25th Century Apartment!!!!Besides that, everything else is worth the dollars."
1,I'd Love It If It Worked,"Being a big Buck Rogers fan, I couldn't wait until this set arrived. I made it through Season One without a problem, but once I got into the second disk of Season Two, every episode freezes up in my DVD player. I tried other players to no avail. What good is a ""complete series"" if you can't play the episodes? Sorry, but while I still love the series, this gets one star for terrible quality control."
3,Fun blast from the past,"""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" is a nice dvd collection of the tv series from the late 70s/early 80s. While the tv show could have been much better (and after watching it again, Glen Larson obviously borrowed some of the same props and even vehicles from his ""Battlestar Galactic"" series-such as the joystick used in the fighters, which has the exact same 3 button configuration and the shuttle that Buck uses in season 2), it was still fun to watch. It would be nice if they had added the tv pilot as well as the theatrical movie that started the series, and it would have also been nice if it had a few extras, but I'm still happy with it overall."
4,This is world music album 1for this year,"This album sounds like Rough guide to the world music(there isn't this one).The album is variegated - Savina sings in a different languages, the instruments are accordion, oud guitars and many more, the songs are from different points of the world.Eüöíò voice, beautiful music.Recommended!"
5,Sumiglia and Savina Yannatou's Voice,"Savina Yannatou is, quite simply, a goddess. Her divine voice transcends categories of ""folk"" or ""classical"". She has mastered Arabic as well as Greek and other Mediterranean languages. Her sound is epic, heartbreaking, quintessentially feminine. It carries you to another realm.Sumiglia"
1,"Not for moderate chewers, imo","I consider my dog a moderate chewer and at about 25 lbs he's not the sturdiest dog around. I gave him this flexi chew bone and within about 3 to 4 minutes he was biting off decent sized chunks and trying to eat them (some successfully). I had to remove the bone after I noticed this and don't plan to give it back to him at any point. I'd say this product is for LIGHT chewers, if any at all. Very disappointed."
2,Doesn't last,"My dog liked it but it didn't last at all, and at the same time I was worrying because it's made of plastic and my dog would just chew it into pieces and swallow them, for small breed puppies might be good, but my small breed adult dog can easily break it."
1,Irish Loyalty,"Please, read the history behind the claddagh ring. I think it's an insult to its meaning to wear it as a toe ring. It's not just another pretty ring it has meaning and it should be worn properly. PLEASE wear it right and show a little Irish pride and loyalty."
4,Still holding up after a couple seasons,"I used one of these patches to repair a hole in my ski jacket. I cut the rectangular patch into a rounded-corner square, and then I applied the patch using a warm iron. After a couple seasons and several washes withNikwax Tech Wash, the patch is still holding strong. The fabric on the edges of the patch have frayed slightly, but there's no sign of peeling. I'm happy with the repair, but I wish that the kit came with more pieces in a variety of sizes. Also, it would be nice if the kit included some flexible sealant that might keep the patches' edges from fraying."
3,Gore-tex Repair Kit,"Not used yet. Purchased for ""stock."" I will have to get back to you (and everyone else) when the time comes to use it."
4,"Fun, with some interesting surprises","My husband and I are 40-somethings who just finished an intro West-coast swing class. We were looking for something a little different for practicing our new moves, even though we love the standards. This collection has some truly unusual twists on the swing genre, with a variety of tempo and mood that make for interesting repeat listenings. My only complaint is that I would trade one more of the English-language tracks for something more exotic."
2,Just OK,"I thought my kids would really like this CD as they love swing, but they rated it as mediocre at best. I wasn't crazy about it myself."
2,Not for kitchen use,"I searched long and hard for ""just right"" pepper and salt mills, looking in both retail stores and on the Internet. I wanted beauty and function. When I saw these made of cherry I was so thrilled.When they arrived they were beautiful but small. That was okay. But my heart sank when I tried using them...especially the pepper mill. It only works well when you use the largest grate which creates huge granules of pepper...the finer settings require many turns to get tiny portions of tiny flakes. I tried the large grate setting on the pepper mill when preparing a chicken dish and the size of the grains made the dish a failure. My husband, who usually loves pepper and hot food, even complained.The salt mill pumps out salt quickly with large flakes. I am a salt lover so I have to go easy with this guy.I'll keep them for special occasions, and will warn guests when they are used, but now I'll have to search for a good pepper mill for cooking and kitchen use."
5,Good Car Charger - Works Well,"Good quality build, all connections fit perfectly, and it charged my phone just fine and shut off when full. Good deal!"
3,"This Book Would Be Up To Date, (if the year was 1994)","Basically nicely done book with great pictures! but it was published in 94 so it's a little off to say the least. for example, it goes on to predict that there will be no more George Romero Zombie Movies. which is funny, because there have been several made since.hope this review helps."
2,"Simple, effective, limited","This program works, and works well for all external SCSIdevices.Read that again carefully: external SCSI devices.Got that new mac with the DVD-R/CD-RW drive, not supported.Got floppies: FineGot a supported (and the list is long) external SCSI CD-RW: fineGot an external Jaz/Zip/HD on that SCSI bus: fine.Don't have a SCSI bus in that new 867Mhz G4: sorry, get one.But if you have that external SCSI device, this is the simple,effective and easy way to backup."
1,Great program for people whose lives are too enjoyable,"I'd read superb reviews of Retrospect, so I was extremely disappointed with the unintuitive interface, the limited choice of backup drives supported (Iomega, for instance, is not among the Anointed, for the most part), and the inability of the program to perform basic functions despite coming with reams of (electronic) documentation. I've got to agree with bunab -- it's all very un-Mac-like. And, like bunab, I'm no newbie -- I've spent plenty of time installing and using software, troubleshooting hardware/software problems. So it's not that I'm a few Bradys short of a Bunch.This is a very stubborn program and it's turning me into a very grumpy person."
5,"Great book, great price","Violin picture books are usually incredibly expensive. Not only is this one disproportionately inexpensive (for a violin book, which category uses a whole different $$ scale than most people use--$500 books are common) but it's beautifully done, with great photos, and a wide spectrum of important violins from important makers. This one is near the top of my list."
2,Prestone Radiator Hose did Not Fit,The hose did not fit my Honda Accord as stated in the Description. I ended up with a 2.50 or so refund for it minus all the shipping charges. I do not think this was fair considering they said it would fit a 1991 Honda Accord LX.
5,Awesome,"These are great cookies. I have two girls with celiac disease, one is a toddler. Finding foods that are like the ""real"" thing is tough these are a great treat and we love them!"
5,Yummy!,I love these cookies. I can't eat gluten and they are a healthy treat. Family members who can eat gluten enjoy them also.
4,Ginger Lover's Desert,"Ginger Snaps are delicious. Not too sweet and loaded with flavor. Wonderful texture, great with a nice cup of tea."
1,Center of cookie is rock hard,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
2,too sweet,"These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left."
5,Great cookies for adults,"Not only will these cookies satisfy a ""sweet tooth"" attack, but they're healthy and will calm nausea and/or upset stomach. Strong ginger flavor, not sugary, so although adults really like them, a lot of kids probably won't be crazy about them."
4,The way the cookie crumbles,"These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found. (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.) They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat. When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.So why only four stars? Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent. The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit. All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price. I'll be ordering these again."
2,Not pleased with these att all!,This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar. I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them. Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.
5,Delicious Cookies I Can Eat!!!,These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free! The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much. 2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen) Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...
3,Mi-Del Royal Vanilla Cookie Review,"The Mi-Del Royal Vanilla Cookies do not have a ""cream center"". The center is a vanilla-flavored hard sugar disc. The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc. After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description. Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first. I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard. Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase."
3,Product shipped and arrived quicky... the cookies in each of the bags were in pieces.,"I order two (2) cases of cookies on the same Amazon order. A case of Ginger Snaps and case of Chocolate Cookies from another manufacture. Both cases arrived quickly from Amazon. But the ginger snaps had many bags where nearly the entire bag of cookies were broken up and in pieces. The other case of cookies (Chocolate Chip) was perfect, Hardly any of them broken."
1,R. Elliott,"Took FOREVER to arrive and the case is way too many cookies to consume! Will stick to my local organic grocery next time. Once again, ordering food from Amazon has fallen far below expectations."
4,A Comparison to Nature's Path EnviroKidz Animal Crackers,"Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavorNature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire."
1,stale cookies,"Sadly, the cookies in this shipment were soft (they should be crunchy). I now only buy them from the store self where they are fresh."
1,too strong...,"If you are looking for mild ginger flavored snaps...these are not it. If you however, enjoy a very strong ginger taste, give these a try."
1,Don't ever buy this product,"These cookies were AWFUL! Really bad. My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it. I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible. Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste. I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it."
3,well,"I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy. like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt. so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers"
1,Broken cookies.,"We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems."
2,I knew that being diagnosed with celiac would change things....,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
1,Very SPICY...,THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.FOR ME I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.........
3,"Sometimes, they will gluten you.","I love this company and what they are trying to do. However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.A couple of years passed. The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe. From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident. I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook. Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.Maybe they have problems with suppliers? I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead."
2,car model kits,I goofed and didnt read farther enought down in the description section. I thought it was one piecemy error. I'm keeping it for a future birthday.
3,Car is just OK,"This is written by my 8yr old son:Pros:Looks goodStickers are easy to put on and you can choose from 2 different setsCons:Wheels don't turn so you can't really play with the carNo doors openBox says ""easy snap"" but it isn't easy"
2,Not what was expected,"At the time of ordering this product, no details were listed that this was a model car. It looked to be like a very detailed child's toy. When it arrived, the outside box made it clear that this is a build/model car. Disappointed in the description not coming close to what you actually receive."
2,To much for average 8yr old,"This ""snap"" together model leaves a lot to be desired. Won't stay together,parts don't fit right, and the instructions are to tough for an 8yr old to figure out!! I would not recommend this for any 8yr old. Sorry."
5,Good filter for my machine,"They work and each one lasts for a couple of months depending upon the hardness and chemicals in your water supply. I cannot for the life of me find these locally. WHy do merchants sell pots without selling the accessories you need? The pot's held up well over the last five years but trying to obtain the water filter which really does make a difference in the quality of your coffee, is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Walmart use to carry these but even then they were hard to find in stock. I purchased two. This should keep the good tasting coffee going for a while and I now have a source to replace them when needed. Needless to say, I was MORE than glad to receive them in Amaazon's more than adequate and timely manner."
3,O.K. BUT is it neccessary?,I must admitt that I was surprised that the coffee pot was using the same filter that came with my Ice Tea maker. It only filters the water before it goes through the coffee grounds. It may be helpful if you don't have decent water...I don't know??? Only a science lab could tell me if the filters really are helpful...I can't tell the difference in taste and I don't feel healthier.
2,Thought I bought a new DVD?,"When I opened my ""new"" Clinical Kinesio Taping DVD, there were already numerous scratches on the DVD. Obviously it wasn't new and appeared used. When I played the DVD, within the first 7-8 minutes, there were lapses already. I'll never buy any products from PRO-MED PRODUCTS any more!"
4,Dawn French rides AGAIN,"From the DVD cover--- ""Mary Tregwednack lives above her post office in the fictitous Cornish Village of St Gweep with her neurotic partner Angela. Lesbians until something better comes up, they enjoy the cosy security of life in a tight-knit coastal community, but their chances of finding suitable men are more remote than the village itself..... For behind this picture-postcard exterior, witchcraft and wife-swapping are more a way of life than cream teas and Cornish pastries. Here, the village bobbie is a Police Calendar's Mr March, the cosy pub hosts swingers' evenings and the local museum is dedicated to witchcraft....."" The Daily Star ""Dawn proves she does have the Midas touch in this comedy""Complete Series one--nearly 3 hours of episodes that will keep you coming back for more..you can't help but laugh your way through them."
4,Lauri Toys Tall-Stacker Pegs and Pegboard set,I gave this as a gift to my granddaughter for her second birthday and she loved it.I would purchase another for another child sometime.
5,Good for OT,"My 23m son looooooves this toy! It's so simple but so brilliant! He stacks the pegs on the pegboard, stacks them without using the pegboard, and for occupational therapy his therapist has him push the pegs into the pegboard, then turn the board over and have him push the pegs out from the bottom (his fingers just barely fit in the little holes). Works his pincer grasp, index finger, and thumb."
1,missing orange peg,"I just now received this item and was disappointed. The outer box it was shipped in was fine, but the box containing the actual toy was damaged -the back is smooshed in -like it was put in the shipping box that way. And one orange peg is missing. Not what I expected for buying a brand new item, and I am disappointed but don't feel it's worth the hassle to return. : ( So now I'm stuck with a missing piece and a box I can't store it in. Ugh!"
4,Physical therapy,"Found this set to be a little less than expected, but it is useful for the purpose of physical therapy. Assisting a friend who has had a stroke. Not as sure that I would use it for small children."
3,Sigh. Purple.,"I apologize if this offends the purple lovers out there, but I can't stand purple, and was sad to receive our package today and discover that the base was purple. I bought this set in addition to the large building set, as that set only has one thick base board and my sons were fighting over it, so I can hardly complain of the toy itself, but I was annoyed to find that the package contents didn't match all the photos and box."
5,Great alternative from lego blocks,"My little one loves to stack and with this toy he got finally his colors down. I will recommended because it helped a lot with motor skills and it was another alternative from ""lego block"". I keep it stored in the same box that it came in since it is sturdy (as long as you are gentle / sturdy hard cardboard) and has handle to carry it from one place to another."
5,Pegs,This toy is great for colour recognition motor skills and as the children get older with be great for basic math problems.I'm a foster carer and its one of the best items in my collection of toys.
5,Easy to make tall towers,"Which is the most interesting thing about this set right now for our 2 year old. He appreciates the patterns mom and dad make but for him, it is all about how tall he can stack the pegs. And they go pretty high without falling over, so he loves it and is content to play with it for surprisingly long periods of time. Also the pegs are easy for little fingers to manipulate which is a big plus.I look forward to his noticing and building patterns as he gets older.Some other reviewers complained about the set being wobbly but we haven't had that problem."
3,board,"the board makes it hard to fit pins in because it is not solid, difficult for my 3 and half autistic son."
2,not an interesting toy for toddlers,"it arrived 3 days ahead.but guess its not interesting toy for 2 yrs old.my son did played with it for sometime and as it contains only 25 pegs,he was looking for more pegs to build his tall tower on the board.i too felt that its not worth $16.he cant do much on it but just build few towers on the pegboard.get bored very soon as dint have much to do with it.lego blocks and the bristle blocks keeps him busy for longer time as he have much options do to with those.i wont recommend this product for toddlers."
4,Fun but a little flimsy,"My 21-month-old loves stacking things and sticking things into other things. So this toy was perfect for him, except that the base should be made of something a little more sturdy. It's rather flimsy rubberized material. He can't play with it in his crib or on my bed. He has to place it on a table or something else with a hard surface. Other than that, he seems to really like it."
3,"Okay toy, terrible value","This is called Lauri Tall Stacker Pegs and Pegboard and has 25 plastic pegs. It is okay, however, I was disappointed by its value. It is way overpriced. I was shopping for a safe pegboard for my 2 year olds. I wish I knew that the pegs are the same as in Tall Stacker Building Set that has 100 pegs and multiple boards and only costs ten dollars more. This set will not grow with your child. I recommend that you buy bigger set and use it longer."
4,A Great Story,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out to be a great movie with a very interesting plot. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as is Johnny Depp."
4,Better than most whiteners.,"Tres White was recommended to me by my dentist but they are a third of the price here on Amazon. The product works pretty well, and covers more teeth than other brands, but leaves my teeth sensitive and will make you expectorate often while using the trays. If I were to whiten again, I'd use them, but don't think they're worth it unless your teeth are really hideous. Vanitas, vanitatum, etc."
1,Terrible Christmas Trash!,"I am a big Power Rangers fan...but this video is 30 minutes of confusion and contradiction. Tommy is still the Green Ranger, but Rocky, Adam and Aisha are Rangers in this video again. Boring to watch!"
1,crashes everytime,We have a lot of video games but can't even get out of the gate with this one. crashes every time.
1,Product just didn't work!,"I followed the directions to a T, and the headset simply would not work. I charged the device multiple times in hopes that it was just the battery, but to no avail. It's possible that it was just my one headset that was defective, but typically with less expensive electronics, if one doesn't work, quite a few won't work. Though this product is less expensive than most bluetooth headsets, it wasn'tworth the frustration for me."
2,not good,"I bought this here and am returning it. It does ot stay on my ear. Perhaps I have excessively small ears...but I do not think that is the case. The way it hooks over is weird, and it is very hard to hear on. Try another, I have to pay return shipping, but Amazon is ""deducting"" it from my refund, this way they can zap me with a huge charge for returning it."
4,Great for the price,"I think this is a great earpeice for the price. My only complaint is that it doesn't get loud enough. I have it turned all the way up, and sometimes it's not sitting tight in my ear and is not loud enough. But for someone like me, who doesn't have it surgically attached to my head, it's worth the price!"
1,Shun this headset.,Poor quality. Bad speaker. Short range. Had to return that after I used it for a day.
4,Educational,"My husband ordered this dvd after scalping our silky terriers. It is helpful ... however, the terriers shown don't have the same type of hair as our silkies ... Still the instruction helped and the subsequent hair cuts have been better."
1,garbage,I bought theseS shoes with anticipation of wearing them to work. I came to find out that they run small and that a 40eu didn't fit. i was very disappointed. i gave them away
3,It was a good book,"Let me just say that this book was obviously written by a man. However, I must give him credit for having the guts to write from a girl's point of view. This book is one of those that tells people that anything can happen. It's for all those girls who have ever idolized a movie star. It says that good things happen to good people, and that if you want something bad enough, your dreams will come true. Despite the fact that every other word is like, I found that I could not put the book down."
4,"Good, Mindless Fun","Janine and Alex, Alex and Janine is a good book. Alex, a typical teen from suburbia is a huge fan of Janine Adams, world-famous super model. When in a chat room, Janine IM's Alex and asks if she'd like to meet. Janine says sure, then realizes it's probably just one of her friends playing a joke on her. Until Janine pulls up in a stretch limo.What follows is a typical Prince and the Pauper trading places shtick that's been done over and over. I find this one especially appealing because Alex has incredible adventures. A romp in Paris with famous male model Jason Sharp, posing for Vogue, attending hotsy-totsy parties. What teenage girl wouldn't like that for a couple weeks?It ends badly (much, much worse than the movie), but I won't spoil that for you. You have to read the book to understand. The character development is excellent and you actually can't stop reading. Give it a try if the teen books out right now are just too bland for you."
2,An Extended Fanfic,"It felt like reading a fashion magazine without the fashion. I'm 15 years old and have read many poorly written fanfics on the internet. ""Janine and Alex, Alex and Janine"" seemed like a long and well written fanfic, but since it's a book and not fanfiction, I gave it a well deserved rating of 2 stars. The main characters were bubbly and stereotypical (annoying). It was filled with over cliched situations (boring). The boy that's meant to get the girl was too sappy and surreal (actually liked his part the most). It didn't accoplish capturing my imagination."
4,like pretty good,"is like, the author like, a high schooler? cause i mean like, he used the word ""like"" about like, 500 times in this book, and there were only like, 300 pages in like the book. Other than that though pretty good!"
4,Thought provoking,"I have read Randy Alcorns other novels, and have found them to make me think about my spiritual life in a deeper way. This new book is no different. Written in a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" style, the futility of pursuing riches on earth is seen for what it really is. While the story is a bit bizarre at times, there are deep biblical truths hidden in the plot-line. I highly recommend this book"
4,Modern day PILGRIM'S PROGRESS,"This book is a modern day version of John Bunyan's PILGRIM'S PROGRESS. The main character wakes up in 'another world' and you journey with him as he tries to figure out where he is, how he got there and how to get home. Through his adventures, you again (as you do in LORD FOULGRIN'S LETTERS) see how Satan lies to us and tries to keep us from walking the path God has chosen for us. You see common sins we all fall into and how silly and foolish we can be when we resist the changes God wants to make in us as He conforms us into the image of our Lord Jesus."
1,Will the Real Author Please Stand up (and resume writing).,"""Wow! Great story!"" I thought, at least throughout the first 3 chapters. Gradually, as I read on, I became more disapointed as the ""plot thickened"" - it becomes quite cliche-ish, such as, ""little people hammering nails into the giants feet! C'mon! (Reminds one of Gulliver's Travels). Now I'm thinking, ""What happened to the writer? Did he suddenly retire and gave the story over to a child with a wild imagination to finish?"" I gave it a fair chance though. I continued on into the 10th chapter or so, or until I was near tears from boredom.A Christian/""Believer"" will easily catch the message that the Author is attempting to put forth here, however, anyone else will most likely be baffled, bored and or humored by it.But don't take MY word for it, read for your self and judge."
4,Engaging reading,"This was the first Randy Alcorn book I have read. He presents with a rather unique style. The story is very thought provoking. The analogies are very good and he has a vivid style of making the story come to life. His theological beliefs can make for a challanging position - especially to those who hold a conservative belief. Nevertheless, this book is a must read for those who are endeared to Christian drama. It has a different style than the Left Behind Series"
3,Convicting,"Before the main character became a Christian, the story was too macabre for me. In fact, some scenes even after that point were overly gruesome, in my opinion. One might argue that evil IS sickening, but Alcorn almost lost me due to this aspect.The story seemed to jump from one bizarre scene to another in the beginning, without enough development for me to follow. I also had the feeling I was missing some of the allegorical significance during this pre-Christian period.The second half of the book, however, completely redeems the entire piece. I seldom highlight while reading fiction, but found myself doing so throughout this section. It is filled with wise words and excellent analogies.This story has encouraged me to live with more of an eternal focus, and has convicted me to be more bold in sharing my faith."
5,Every choice has a consequence,"This is the second fiction novel by Randy Alcorn that I have read, I was not dissapointed. At first I was a bit lost in this ""unknown world"", but the way it is told is fascinating. One day Nick Seagrave wakes up in a strange unfriendly place, to meet questionable characters...then has choices to make which he only understands at the end of his trip (and even the destination seems out of reach at times).This book was truly enjoyable. Without being too aware of it, Randy A. has once again made me think about the way I live MY life, and if I may find much treasure or not in the end."
1,Slow developing plot with no end in site,A friend recommended this book. I was greatly disappointed in the writer's style.
1,This book was strangely non-compelling,"I think too many Christian authors try to write ""classics"" instead of telling a good story, and, to me, that's what is going on here. It's kind of like ""Pilgrim's Progress"" on an acid trip. The main character is a cliche of ""the self-made man who cared only about his career who neglected his family and then he lost them and, oh yes, one of them died tragically"". HO-HUM. He gets swept into ""eternity"", and the scene changes constantly, one second it seems to be heaven, then the next second it's hell. I had to give this only one star because, frankly, I wasn't drawn in enough to finish it. Note to aspiring Christian authors: don't try to be C.S. Lewis or J.R.R. Tolkien. You can't be. OK?"
4,Much better than I expected,"I read this book because it came highly recommended from a close relative. I launched into it expecting it to be a rehash ofJohn Bunyan's ""The Pilgrim's Progress"", but I now feel that notion couldn't have been further from the truth. Mr. Alcorn did an excellent job of making an allegory of life as a follower of Christ. This story touched on struggles I have gone through myself, but in such a general way that anyone might find themselves somewhere on the road portrayed in this book. As a matter of fact I'd say that most people should be able to find themselves mentioned in this book even if only briefly. Read this book as a source of encouragement to faith and perseverance, a sign-post pointing toward the truth, and as a unique perspective on the breadth of the Christian life and the depth of its struggles and victories. Then, once you've read this, read the GuideBook that it mentions so many times."
5,Edge of Eternity,"I don't usually like Christian fiction, but this book is so well written and so thought-provoking, that I would recommend it to everyone. I finished the book several days ago, but it is still on my mind so much that I will re-read it. Randy Alcorn is such a gifted writer, with insights that challenge the reader to really think."
4,Worth a second read!,"Like all allegories, this book will have you more and more perplexed throughout, making you read through too fast to get to the end and have your questions answered. The problem with that is, your questions are never answered completely and you begin to wonder what you missed by skimming over. This in itself makes it worth a second read.I read this book several years ago, then loaned it out and it never was returned. But I did not forget it. Over time, I forgot who wrote the book and from time to time I realized I needed to read the book again to put my mind at rest. When I discovered it in Kindle format I couldn't wait to buy it. After reading it again, I understood more and enjoyed the book immensely. Highly recommended for all serious thinkers."
3,"OK, not the best","The review above hits the nail on the head. My first thought when I received the lens was ""wow, that big"" It is not a problem, just an observation. You will need to use a tripod or monopod with this lens.To be honest I could barely tell the difference with the lens on and off. Images are slightly sharper and magnified just a bit.The real benefit seems to be a sharper image from tight to med-wide (as far as you can go without vignetting). I have not used it much for close-ups as I heard it is really excellent at close range.Honestly, I'm not sure the lens is worth the $$$ (due to the vignetting). I've considered returning it..."
5,Stainless steel lock washers,"A replacement for shop stock, obviously a cut above the average and engineered to operate safely and effectively. These may be used on our personal vehicles, our grandsons' toys or many other items around our property. There is ABSOLUTELY no doubt these will work and work well. tene'"
1,Great in the 90's but not for today,"Just to note, this book was written in 1996. Since some of Kevyn Aucoin's books were written around the same time I was going to discriminate based on age. The focus is on makeup & skincare (face & body). Instructions come with amazing visual aids, some of the best I've seen. Unfortunately, the makeup colors are dated, as are several of the products (cake foundation, eye foundation, etc). There is also a lot of emphasis on correcting, like using shading to downplay your face shape. And please don't follow the eye makeup recs for Asian eyes on page 95.Skip it. It would be great if DK came out with an updated version because the style does seem very user friendly."
4,Nice to see this author back with a punch!,"Loved it. Another good makeup book. Count this one for quality along with Aucoin's MAKING FACES, Pallingston's LIPSTICK, and Arpel's MAKEUP"
1,defective wire stretcher,"In order for this wire splicer/stretcher to work both ends of the wire to be spliced/stretched has to be solidly anchored to effectively pull the wire. The Dutton-Lainson 400 All-Purpose Fence Stretcher/Splicer that I bought will not grip the wire. the wire slips during the pull and that means it will not do the job.the other thing that bothers me is that to return this item, I have to pay the shipping. The item cost about $34. By the time I pay shipping to send it back plus the initial shipping cost, it doesn't make sense to send it back for a refund if they don't pay shipping for a defective item."
3,"Solid workout, low production values","For anyone who practices yoga regularly, BSTY vol. 2 provides a light, fun workout for ""off"" days. The production value is low (home movies) and it can be difficult to hear the instructor at times. The music is a bit imposing at first but not overly distracting once you become engaged in the workout. The entire workout runs approximately 40 minutes (~25 min. of floorwork, including 5 minutes of guided relaxation at the end) Outside of a few cheesy tones and a couple of references to the ""sexual core"", the program is fairly tame. A beginner could work up to this program fairly quickly. Experienced yoga practitioners might want to start with volume 3. Though there is not a lot of detailed instruction during the workout, the special feature section offers more guidance on the poses. All in all, a solid workout that targets the ab/pelvic muscles."
5,The BEST HBO Show Ever Made,This is the third season of probably the best HBO show ever made. It will be frustrating to watch through the end of the season and wonder what could of happened next had the show been kept around instead of making Rome.
4,naughty but nice -,"Have purchased all three seasons of DEADWOOD, for my son as gifts. After much prodding, decided to give it a watch( thinking one or two episodes, then he would be appeased.) Hard to describe the content and sometimesrough demeanor. I am so hooked, got so caught-up in thecharacters, await the next episode. If you like history,and your not faint of heart, give a try. Like nothing I'veseen."
5,Third season DWood preview,Deadwood just keeps getting better as the characters continue to develop from one episode to the next and one season to the next.
2,Depressing and Disappointing,"SPOILER WARNING I loved Deadwood up to the last two episodes. The ending of a story is the most important element and this ending soured the entire Deadwood experience for me. The entire third season built up to a grand confrontation which never happened. The series just sputtered out with the main characters, both noble and corrupt, basically giving in. As Seth Bullock said in the last episode ""I did nothing."" Neither did anyone else, including the writers. Sorry folks, the ending was depressing and disappointing. Though one of the third season episodes has the greatest bare handed street brawl ever filmed."
3,Are you kidding me?,I can't believe they ended the series like this. I'm flabergasted. The ending (if you can even call it that) was the most anti-climatic event since Geraldo opened Al Capone's vault. The whole season was building toward an epic confrontation but it totally missed the boat in the end. I realize that the series is loosely based on actual historical figures and events but they should've taken some creative liberties and given the viewers what we all wanted - a satisfying conclusion. It's so frustrating to see a show that I've loved go out this way. Frustrating and depressing.I would've rated it a couple of stars lower because of that but this season also happens to have a few of the best episodes in the entire series.
3,Good but cancellation is no surprise,"I've enjoyed Deadwood but I'm not surprised it was canceled. Despite any other excuses or explanations shows are canceled for one reason... people aren't watching it. A show like the Sopranos might get away with season after season where nothing happens, however Deadwood is a western. The genre does require a certain amount of action and moral unambiguity. The characters are so compromised by the end of the third season that one is left with the inability to care if any survive. Even Bullock becomes party to the murder of a [...].So, I'm not surprised it was canceled. Fans of westerns simply don't tolerate this much evil in it's heroes. And frankly, despite the current love of nihilism in Hollywood, most people back then were honest, as they are today. The town is way too over-populated with anti-heroes.Not enough of what enough viewers want to keep it on the air."
3,A Dissapointing End To A Critcally Acclaimed Show,"Deadwood has quickly become a cult classic with its endeering characters, riveting plot, and colorful language. Season one and two were awe inspiring representations of the Deadwood camp and the lives of those who lived in it. From the first episode of Season one I was entralled in the story of Sheriff Bullock, Ale Swearenger, and Wild Bill Hickock. I have eagerly awaited the third and possibly final season of Deadwood for almost five months now. Having watched it, in its entirety, I am horrendously dissapointed in the quality of its character, direction of its plot, and incompletness of its story especially in its later days. There were rumors on there being two additional movies made in order to ""wrap up"" the series. The ending of this season was so unbelievably dissapointing that I coudnt think of how a movie could finish what was always, until now, an amazing cinematic adventure."
3,Should've had more seasons!!,I dislike it cause it was to short of a series...should've had more seasons to it...The finish could've been alot better!!
2,Deadwood third season,"For some reason, our new DVDs were scratched up and the movie would stop abruptly. Guess Amazon sold us used movies not new ones. Very disappointed, however the movie is good but HBO did not finish the final series and the ending was left unfinished. Shame on HBO hope they do not do that to any more movie series."
4,they made it right,The discs we recieved had been purchased from a video store going out of bussiness and 5 of the 6 discs were unreadable but acra video replaced the bad discs in a timely manner and for no charge
2,Deadwood Series III DVD,Disappointed with the delivery. The package inside flap had a sheet removed from the flap and the only way I would have known was the clue was still there. Also the tab that held the 5th DVD was broken and the DVD was just flopping in the jacket. I had no problems with the others two series. Too bad.
2,Deadwood Season 3 DVD,Very unhappy with product once opened. One full DVD out of a set of six was scratched and virtuallyunwatchable. I was happy with the purchase process and price and delivery time.
3,Not as good as the first two...,"So this gets three stars because the show is still one of the most brilliant bits of tv out there, but this season was disappointing over all. They introduced too many new characters, which while well acted, went nowhere, were underdeveloped, and didn't move the overall plot along at all. The motivations of the main characters were often completely unfathomable, and the tense buildup to the last episode went... Nowhere. One of the least satisfying endings to a tv show ever."
3,A Slip from season to season,"Season one was one of the best things I've ever seen on TVDeadwood - The Complete First Season. Season 2 was close, but not quite thereDeadwood - The Complete Second Season, and season 3 slipped a little more. The sets, costumes, acting, and cinematography remain excellent. But the storyline seems to grow increasingly burdensome. It's still worth watching, if nothing else to complete the series."
5,Classic art through a dirty screen,This may be the best entertainment value since Lonesome Dove. From casting to script and all parts between it is very well done. Prepare yourself to look past the profanity and enjoy some of the richest dialog to come to TV or movies. The previous two seasons are equally good. The whole story develops very well.
5,Deadwood,I rated the series before the time periodalways interested me and the peoplethat made america Hell on Wheelsis interesting also
4,Deadwood - Quite a Place,"I really enjoyed this series. Don't know how closely this relates to actual history, but none the less, I found it very good and interesting. It takes you back to a time and place when life was really rough and tough. Be warned, it includes a lot of violence, sexual situations and crude language."
5,Human waste? I think not...human Gold BABY!,The wait is almost over and I will soon be able to watch Al rip people a new one every single day... My girlfriend is going to go nuts when I get my very own copy of Deadwood Season 3...WHY MUST IT END!? Damn you HBO for not renewing the actor's contracts!
4,deadwood season 3,ORDERED THIS FOR A FRIEND BECAUSE HE WANTED IT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. As far as I know it's exactly what he wanted.
3,Deadwood DVD set,Price was good for DVD set but DVD case was cracked and showed much wear. DVD's have played well though.
3,Season 3 jumped the shark,"Its easy to see why the series ended with season 3. the writers pretty much wrote themselves into a corner. too bad, they had such an amazing cast. they really could have done so much with this series. but how much can you do with a western where no one leaves the bar or rides a horse?"
3,"Still Better than Many, but not as Good as it Was","Though I gave the first two seasons an unreserved five stars, this season gets only 3 1/2. The dialogue is as poetically dense as ever, the acting is still first rate, and the show still looks fabulous. The problem this season seems to be with the overall narrative drive - in the end, events don't seem quite as urgent as they did in the first two years, nor do they add up to much; added to that, the characters' personal stories don't seem quite as dramatic. Of course, part of this may be attributable to the fact that David Milch and HBO ended the show before the story arc had fully played out, but I'm not sure that that explains all of it. It's hard to put my finger on, but there's just a certain something - some kind of spark - lacking in this season. Still, the actors give it their all here, and there are still some fine moments."
2,"coulda, woulda, shoulda","Interesting premise: fact based stories, realistic production design and a good cast all set in a real town from the old west but all undermined by some silly competition to see which of the low-lifes can use the F-word the most. One well played scene after another gets the dramatic momentum ripped out from under it by this over-the-top dialogue. Perhaps they thought that if it worked for the Sopranos it would work here."
1,Vulgar and loads of swearing,"very disappointing, vulgar and swearing. I watched about 15 mins. and couldn't bear it. Not for me !"
5,San Francisco C#cksucker!,If you watch the series- you will understand the title-Very entertaining and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing and a lot of cussing.
1,Product does not work,"I received the product quick, but the product did not work. I immediately emailed customer service after a couple emails. I was instructed they would send me another one. I received the second sensor and again it did not work. I did not have a good experience with this product. Also, the picture looks nothing like the product it is big, bulkly and out dated. It does not look anything like the one that comes with the wii system."
1,Lie Lie Lie,"LIE:Contrary to the description...this unit is larger than the sensor bar that comes with the Wii console.LIE:The description also says something about ""utilizing the same frequency"" which is a crock of you know what. The sensor bar uses infrared LEDs and they just turn on...no ""frequency"" beyond the infrared range...like every other sensor bar on the market. There is no setup or configuration with the sensor bars, no signal is sent from them to the console. The brains of the whole system is in you hand. It's the wiimote that figures out the triangulation based on the infrared flashlight next to your TV (the sensor bar).LIE:The description also says that it extends the range up to 12 meters...let's see, that's 36 feet! Do people play Wii while they take their garbage out? No other sensor bar on the market can do this, how can this thing do it and be so cheap?"
3,Eh...,"Well not only did it take longer than it was supposed to, to ship, but sometimes it will not recognize the wii remote and you have to get right up to it and try to find the sensor."
2,Didn't work properly,I bought this for my Wii and it ver worked properly. The pointer would jump very often on the screen and there were no instructions on how / if it could be adjusted. I went back to using my original wired sensor bar.
4,yep,"I agree,it wasn't as good as the first season. Willing to give the third a try. I love the books, and the first season, hoping the third is better!!!"
2,Terrible Sequel!,"Season 1 was great; as for season 2...what happened? it usually takes a little longer for the writers to mess it up completely. So sad....One can only hope the redeem themselves on 6/13...please stop the SOAP style...I just wanna throw up.And to top it all, the bluray is so slow to load"
4,Compelling,Found this series compelling. Had to keep going back for more. Confronting in places but still well worth seeing more than once.
5,True Blood season 2,Great series. DVD was delivered much sooner than I expected and in great condition. I was very pleased.
5,Its TRUEBLOOD... Need I say more??,It came exactly like promise.. Actually I think it was a day or two early. Have not had a problem with any of the DVD's... I would deff buy from seller again!
5,FANTASTIC SHOW,This show is fantastic. I really enjoy the drama and situations the characters get into. The cast is quite fantastic and do the books justice.
4,Expectations,"After I got over my expectation that the series would follow the story line of Charlaine Harris's books, I enjoyed it for what it is. Not exactly like the books."
4,A little off track,"I'm a die-hard fan of True Blood, so I'm being patient with Season II. So I hope some of the departures from the vampires theme (I'm trying not to give anything away here) get resolved at the end of this season. Other than that, though, I'm loving it!"
5,Great,Came very quick and the discs were in perfect condition. Would not trade this box set with the world. The plaic inside that held the discs was cracked but it wasnt a big deal at all.
4,True Blood is a vampy good time,"The second season of HBO's True Blood is a great season of TV to watch. It differs from the book, but takes the show to a whole new level."
5,Great story telling,I loved the books. The show develops the characters and takes the stories to a new level. True Blood is excellent and very engaging.
4,True Blood 2nd season,The Bluray version is an excellent transfer and the story is good the only reason the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the books are much better. The series spent to much time developing minor characters. I got it used and it is the best way to buy Bluray series beca8use the DVDs are in good shape but affordable.This was the 2nd Blu ray used series I bought through Amazon and I am very happy with both
1,Too Expensive to RENT!,"Too Expensive to RENT!Even thought in one place is says ""click to BUY the episode""deceptive"
4,Coming Out June 24th,"I just wanted to write that I watched this show as it aired on HBO this past summer. The dvd box set is sure to be awesome, and I will be purchasing on Bluray.The DVD is being released on June 24th, according to HBO."
3,Computers Have Hard Time Streaming HD,"It works just fine, but the image is actually clearer on the normal version instead of the HD, reason being is that computers have a hard time streaming HD. Unless you have an EXCELLENTA COMPUTER, I'd recommend just getting the normal version."
5,This was a gift!,My daughter-in-law loved this. She cherishs these type of collections. Will buy more when she has them on her Christmas list.
1,True bore,"I watched the first two episodes and scanned the rest of this HBO series, and after seeing Band Of Brothers I figured this would be another block buster film. Much to my dismay, it was not. I thought it dragged on and there was too much sex. If I wanted to waste my time watching perverts f**ck I would watch a porno. (Not into that) I thought this would be an interesting flick based on Vampires, with a little gore, excitement, and the feeling you get when you see a film & you are on the edge of your seat knowing that there is someone right around the corner waiting to pounce upon you. Not so. Most of the good parts happened at the end of an episode just to entice you to tune in next week to see what happened. I rated this film one star & that was being a little nice. My opinion, it stinks."
4,Review,"Did not buy for myself! Old lady seems very pleased with this series....I can only comment on the condition of product...great shape,great shipping speed. Not a single complaint as far as condition. Will continue to buy these sets from Amazon as long as the series runs on HBO. I see this series in stores but It looks like Amazon has it 6 to 10 bucks cheaper than anywhere I found it locally.As for the storyline...I have no clue about or interest in this series BUT it seems to captivate the females that live in my house!!"
5,True Blood Season One,Delivered quickly and in good condition. Loved every minute of this and can not wait for the second season to be revealed!!!!!!!!! Love the story Lines!!
5,Super buy,"I love True Blood and this was cheap and perfect condition when I got it. If you are debating the buy, go for it!"
5,No complaint,Great condition. All discs present and functional. Nothing to complain about. Love the show and price was competitive. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the show as the product was good.
1,rental$ $3? really?,"I have a free $10 coupon, and I wouldn't even waste THAT just renting a single episode of a TV show. I would rather the coupon expire. Get real. Maybe 50 cents to rent a TV episode. A dollar if I HAD to see a single episode for some reason. . . like the last MASH / Cheers or something.3 bucks to rent? ha. I shouldn't watch too much TV anyway. True blood and HBO may just be on their way out. Not worth it all around."
4,VERY GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,The 2nd season continues and doesn't suffer the sophomoric slump typical of many TV series primarily because of the focus and later resolution of the Mary Ann character. There's some further digging into the mortal lives of some of the vampires and Eric seems to have a desire to take Sookie away from Bill. It's about a notch down from season one and like the previous season the 10-12 episodes leave me feeling I've only watched half a season. MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: June and July of 2010.
4,Episode 7 of Season 2 - Interesting Developments,"""Release Me"" is the seventh episode of season 2 and, like the last episode, it is fairly disturbing in places (even more so than other episodes). No spoilers, most of the below is in the synopsis.Sookie and Hugo are still captive at the church\camp and Jason's position there changes significantly. Daphne and MaryAnn's relationship is fully explained and Sam has some trouble dealing with it. Jessica and Hoyt spend some quality time together.It is rated TVMA so it is not for younger viewers.CFH"
5,True Blood,The true blood series just are a new spin on vamps that I enjoy watching to see what is going to happen next. the actors are good at each role they play so interesting see where it'll go from one series to the next. I still enjoyed the second series but love the first because it started it.
5,Its addicting,"If you like walking dead or other such shows, than you will enjoy true blood. The acting may not be to par, but the storyline certainly keeps you wanting to watch more :)"
4,True blood season 2,Great season however it's extremely over priced. The only reason I made the purchase I didn't have cable due to hurricane sandy no other choice really.
4,TRUE BLOOD SEASON 2,"TRUE BLOOD IS TRUELY THE MOST CREATIVE, INTENSE, SPELL-BINDING SERIES. YOU ARE BEING THROWN INTO A NEW WORLD EVERY EPISODE. THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. DON'T WATCH THIS INFRONT OF CHILDREN."
1,Vampire Fans Beware,"Season 2 strays from the central vampire theme and movesinto complete absurdity. Shape shifters, greek gods, a townfull of zombies??? The only thing missing is UFOs and martians.Compared to ""True Blood"",......""Twilight"" seems like serious drama.Vampire fans beware. This is not ""Interview With The Vampire"" or""30 Days Of Night"".--"
1,Freedom in Release,Pure fire shine down. Chains are broken. Freedom in release..... but sorrow for love misrepresented....Hope in what may yet beDON'T WATCH THISDON'T LOOSE YOUR SOULDON'T FORSAKE YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE
2,true blood,My daughter requested this video... I wish I had known of its contents before purchasing it. It's R rated.
4,Episode 3 of Season 2 - Really Enjoyable!,"""Scratches"" is the third episode of season 2 and it is one of the better of the series right out of the gates! No spoilers, most of the below is in the synopsis.Sookie, Bill, and Jessica return from ""cleaning up"" the mess left behind after the last episode, but the trip is interrupted when a powerful creature attacks Sookie. The Tara, Sam, and MaryAnn triangle continues to develop but little more is reveled. Despite the way he treated Lafayette, I am really liking the Eric character.It still is rated TVMA so it is not for younger viewers.CFH"
3,"Love the show, hate the discs","Buyer beware. I purchased True Blood Seasons 1 & 2 and have had problems with both. Somehow my ""brand new"" season 1 DVD set was missing disc 3. So I went through the hassle of the return just to get the replacement with a barely playable disc 5 (scratches etc...). So far in watching the 2nd season I am having playing problems as well (more scratches!). Not sure I want to go through the return hassle again but I wonder what is going on? Also not sure I plan to buy DVDs through Amazon anymore.As for the show... guilty pleasure and I LOVE IT!"
5,True Blood: The Complete Second Season,"This offering is a must have for any vampire fan. It is hands down the most thrilling and inspiring acting and cinematography in the business. The use of just enough nudity to be sexy without being vulgar is refreshing especially today with all the oversaturation. True Blood has what you need, where you need it, and when you need it. Period. And nothing that you don't."
3,True Blood Continues,I didn't think season two was as good as season one but I did enjoy it. It got a little campy at certain points in the story.
4,True Blood Book Fan,"I hadn't seen any of the television episodes, but I did read the books. The True Blood series doesn'tfollow the events of the books, but this makes the characters new to me in all different scenerios. Loads of fun and blood. Enough funny stuff to make it less gruesome. The casting was well done. I will be getting the complete series."
3,My least favorite season of the series.,"The biggest plotline with the dryad had me wishing for it to end already. If I didn't like the outlying characters as much as I did (except for Sookie, whom I'm just not a fan of the more the series carries on) I probably would have given up on the series. Doom on me if that happened. Luckily I toughed it out although while grinding my teeth. Seriously, the dryad was the never-ending plotline that was stretched so thin is was nearly translucent. By maybe episode four or five I was convincing myself that they just couldn't drag it out any longer. They couldn't. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THERE. Silly me. It was the Energizer Bunny of plotlines. Thank god it ended with season two. I couldn't take any more of that insipid wood woman and her weird orgy cult."
1,allan ball:FAIL!!!!!!!!!!,"The First Season was so good... and this second was such a letdown... What in God's mind were they thinking? They have changed the original story, it's so bad I want to re-write it myself.SPOILERS-------------------------------------------I mean, Having Godric the maker of Eric? I mean please, in the book Godric is a very old vampire who is a pedophile and has done a lot of bad things and wants to die because of his actions, but is not the maker of eric in the original story. They also changed the name of the Maenad , in the original story, it's Callisto, not Maryann, and she's not a social worker, and she does not die. In the original story Callisto has a romantic relationship with Sam, but she breaks up with him. In the series, MaryAnn is after Sam and wants to kill him. Also in the book, Maryann /Callisto does not transform into a monster like in the series. In the book, there is a sex club in which she appears and everyone who's in it die, except for tara, and eggs."
2,"Great Show, Bad Policy","I recorded most of True Blood Season 2 last summer on my DVR but I missed two episodes.I though I would just purchase them from Amazon because I had some credit left from a gift card. Then I found two problems. First, I was disappointed to see that it's $3 per episode, not the $3 I am used to for TV shows. Second, I was even more disappointed to see that it's only a RENTAL, not a purchase. HBO and Amazon expect you to pay $3 an episode to watch the season ONE TIME!?!That's just crazy. If they want to make them rentals they can't be more than $1 per episode. If I pay more than that I expect to OWN the series and be able to watch them over and over. This is why people download shows illegally, unreasonable policies and ridiculous pricing."
1,Misleading and dishonest rental policy.,We rented the second season of True Blood yesterday. We were lead to believe we could watch whatever episode we wanted for 60 days. We are a family of 5 so it is not me alone in thinking this. Went to see first episode tonight even though one of us had already seen it last night. Guess what. No longer available unless I buy or rent it. Again? Are you kidding? I just paid for the entire season 24 hours ago. 28 bucks. Talk about a rip off and false advertising. I will no longer buy or rent any movie or series form Amazon again. In fact I may never buy another book on my Kindle if this is how Amazon nickel and dimes a good customer. Stay with Netflix. If amazon buys netflix then I will cancel my netflix account too.
4,"""I am vampire...yes!""","I thought the first season of ""True Blood"" was laughably bad, and Season Two is as well, but I must admit, I'm hooked. This season introduces some new characters with new supernatural powers, and although much of the plot is way out there and kind of ridiculous, I enjoyed it immensely. By far, my favorite scene this season is when Bill goes shopping at Forever 21, but there are definitely many hilarious moments to choose from. Despite Eric's bad haircut, Bill's aversion to using contractions, and Sookie's annoying gap-toothed smirk, there's still a lot of great things about this show. For me, a lot of my amusement revolves around the bad acting (the chick who plays the vampire queen is hands-down the worst actress that has ever appeared on an HBO program). However, any time Jason Stackhouse appears on screen, you are guaranteed to laugh your head off. I am looking forward to what's in store for the citizens in Bon Temps when Season Three begins."
5,True Blood: Season 2,The DVD was brand new and in perfect condition and I received it in a timely manner!
4,true blood the complete second season,"It is a good crazy series. The disc 4 would not play, but I was sent a replacement disc promptly."
5,A Show That I can Sink My Teeth Into,True Blood is one of my all time favorite vampire tv shows I really enjoyed this season especially the fact one of my favorite Swedish actors had gotten more of a storyline among the many reasons. I recomend this to any true blood or vampire fan.
1,Slow boat to China...still waiting on DVDs,"Well since I ordered this product over a month ago and still have not received it...my only critique as of now is that I could have received this alot faster through other retailers, Barnes n Nobles only takes 1 wk to send me my movies and Best Buy takes 2 weeks tops! I ordered season 1 from Barnes n Noble (gift card) the same day I ordered season 2 from Amazon (it was cheaper). Sometimes saving a couple of bucks is not worth the wait. Unfortunately, this is not the only DVD I am waiting on from Amazon.com, I have 2 more that have not arrived here. I will think twice about ordering movies from Amazon.com again."
3,Shouldn't be able to review until released/season is finished.,"There are blogs and forums to review shows, this is a product review not a show review FAIL. There are spammers on here who do get paid to write some of those ridiculously long epic reviews of how great something is before it gets released ( You know who you are). People pull the same stunts with video games, and books. Key words PRODUCT REVIEW not show review or a fans memoir of how the show changed your life. The review system on Amazon is not accurate by a long shot, seehttp://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Mens-Three-Short-Sleeve/dp/B002HJ377A/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topRead the three wolf moon reviews, this is basically people making a mockery of a product and the Amazon review system. They should disable reviews for products not released until release date, tag reviews by people who didn't buy the product from Amazon, and do a better job of policing personal attacks on other reviewers."
3,not as good as season 1,way to much going on in season 2 hope season 3 will be slower now that she is dead and i realy hope erik fights bill and does a number on him
1,"Terrible, do not use this person!","I ordered this product and waited and waited for the DVDs to come, for about a month. The day after the last estimated date of arrival I finally received a refund because the product was apparently ""out of stock."" I'm sure it didn't take a whole month to figure out that the product was out of stock, especially when I had gotten a confirmation of shipment, without a tracking number. The seller also did not respond when I asked where my DVDs were. I would not recommnend anyone to purchase from this seller."
1,HBO ripping people off,"So this is more a review against HBO then the series.I find it irresponsible that HBO is releasing a 12 episode series on 5 discs. This means that are only 2 or three episodes on each disc.Now blu-ray disc has a higher capacity then standard dvd. IN comparison the Simpsons Season 20 Bluray released 24 episodes on 2 discs. Granted, Simpsons episodes are only 30 mins, but that's still 6 hours of video on each disc opposed to the 2 or 3 hours on the True Blood discsI just find it unfair that Hbo does this so they can jack up the price of their product."
1,review??,review??? cant review product since Amazon has dealings with liars who never shipped item (even though i was charged when they told amazon that item shipped)...Amazon probably didnt even remove seller from their marketplace.
5,Only one word sums up this show,"'AWESOME'I haven't been so hooked on a show in quite some time. I cannot wait to add this to my collection, best HBO series since Oz."
4,One of the best shows on HBO,"I'm a HUGE fan of ""True Blood."" I loved the first season,but the second season was more about Mary Ann,and less of the Vampires.I'm glad we saw the end of this sadistic devil.I'm looking forward to the next season after Bill asked Sookie to marry him,and when she comes out of the ladies room to say ""Yes,""Bill's gone,and Jason kills Eggs by mistake."
5,Better than the first season!,"Wow! This is such a great show that gets better with each season. I was worried that the show would lost it's spark after the first season, but not so. I loved the vampire story line with Eric (and Pam!) becoming more prominent characters. Also, I'm so glad that they kept Lafayette alive! I love his character. The only complaint I have with this season is the mynad story line. I didn't really like it all the much but the great vampire story line made up for it! I bought HBO on my tv so I could watch season 3 and not have to wait forever for it to come out on dvd. Love this show!!"
3,It Dragged,"It was good, but unlike the first season it didn't keep me waiting on the edge of my seat while watching. The previews for the next show where actually better than the episodes. I wasn't as eager to see each show as I was with all seasons of Dexter the second season True Blood was boring with the Mary Anne story dragging and should have moved on faster. I hope the third season is like the first one. I own the first one so I feel like I should get the second one. I hope the second season was building for a hugh third season then I will appreciate it."
5,"Are you an addict? I'd like to think I'm not, but.....","I watched the whole thing the day I got it. It's fascinating! Not so close to the Charlaine Harris Sookie Stackhouse books all the time, but that would be weird anyway.As to the blu ray? I watched a few episodes of this TV series with friends who didn't have hi def and frankly, ick. So I am spoiled senseless with HD at home and blu ray when everything comes out on DVD.This series has a lot of rich visuals that are sometimes jolting on the eyes as is the story line. It ain't no Twilight, ok? I don't think I'd let a 13 year old daughter watch it, or maybe I'd just ban it from the house if I had teenagers at all.Thank whoever that I don't. Heh."
5,"Best show ever, again!","Season 2 was just as awesome as season 1,I think this is a must for anyones dvd library! I just cant wait for season 3!"
5,first for everything,"Product came in great condition, however, I was disappointed that it took longer to ship than was stated. Oh well, I guess there's a first time for everything right?"
5,two thumbs up,i just finished watching the first 6 shows on my ondemand and i have to say i am as hooked on Trueblood as i am on the books. The show and the book do have some differences but i still love seeing the books come to life! I am waiting for season 1 to come in the mail so i can see the shows from the beginning. I would recommend this show to anyone who cant enough of Sookie Stackhouse!
4,True Blood Season 2,"I have to agree with Grymdycche, they started to loose the plot a little, reports say they rushed the last few episodes, I have read all the books, and I am still a huge fan of the show, but hopefully the long wait for season 3 will be worth it, and I am glad they hotted up Eric though, and made him more humorous like the books.Guess I'll have to watch The Vampire Diaries till it resumes next year, not the same though."
4,GREAT!,"I enjoyed pretty much everything about season 2, however Maryann occasionally got on my nerves. This is great and there is way more Eric in this season than the first, which is a bonus! Leads into an even better season 3."
5,love it!,"true blood rox my sox, if you are one of those people who thinks you wont like this show just because you dont like vampires, than you were exactly like me. then i watched this show and realized that vampires are cool if you make them cool like this show does"
5,Fangtastic!!,"As a Trubie... I have nothing but good things to say about this series. Excellent story line, sexy characters and every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat. Great Entertainment!!"
4,True Blood Seasons 1&2,"After watching seasons 1&2 of TB, Please tell me that Sookie&Jason are not going to be this stupid for the remaining series? In season 1 Sookie seems very naive for a WOMAN her age.After watch more episodes I began to realize that she's a stupid little girl who talks too much.Her actions and mouth get almost everyone danger someway somehow.Poor Bill after hundreds of years on earth he picks Sookie,the man can't get a good days sleep for always having to come to her aid. Honestly if it wasn't for the other actors(Tara,Lafayette,Sam)I might stop watching the show at times.I hope for Jason & Sookie sake they smarten up,cause as of now they are down right funny! Waiting to receive Season3 so that I can yell at Jason & Sookie some more.Also Rutina(Tara)is great,Tara and Lafayette work well together"
3,"More gore than S1, not any better","Entertaining, although the amped up gore from already-high Season 1 levels doesn't necessarily enhance the interesting discomfort achieved in S1, that was as much about incongruous characters in bizarre situations as it was gore."
1,"Rent it, if you must ...","... but do not waste your money on this series. Season One was okay ... I was rather mixed on my thoughts concerning it. Switchblade-like fangs got the series off to a bad start. But it seemed to gather some momentum, but then sputtered. I was interested enough to get Season Two. It had maybe one or two interesting moments, but overall, it was a complete disappointment. The story line was really weak, and the attempts at humor fell completely flat. The surprise ending is that the series did not end with this season ... Again, if you absolutely have a lot of time to waste and think this series might fill that void ... and you already had your root canal and colonoscopy ... then get this from the local library or borrow it from some other fool who was parted from his/her money. This Season stinks ..."
2,What a waste of good acting talent,"Looking for a great sci-fi fantasy? Love interesting plots and great drama? You won't find it in this series....No--if you're into sci-fi and vampires and you purchased True Blood for these reasons, you will be disappointed to find your eyes assaulted by nothing more than pornography and 'Debbie-Does-Dallas' type clichés. The marketing for this series is the problem...They need to advise potential viewers that this is primarily for the hard-core sex addict, and not for sci-fi fans. The only good thing I can say about it is that the actors are convincing--despite the deplorable scripts they are forced to endure... Two stars then, instead of only one."
3,True Blood Season 2/ Book 2 Dead in Dallas,"In season 2, Sookie travels to Dallas to find Godric (Eric's maker). Jason joins a church that is against vampires, Lafayette is captured and tortured by Eric. Bon Temps is overtaken by a supernatural creature who gets her energy from orgies/violence."
4,much better than expected,I have read all the books and was excited to see there was a series. Don't get HBO so I bought the season 1 dvd's. I thoroughly enjoyed the series even though some of the characters were added or changed. Anna Pacuin is great as Sookie. I like all the characters so far but Bill and Jason stand out!! I like the look of Eric and hope he develops as he did in the books. Even got my husband hooked!! Where is Bubba?????
4,"If you like candy, you are in for a treat","As silly as the story lines are, I have enjoyed this Season very much! I have returned to episodes over and over again just for a pick me up.Jason Stackhouse especially is a riot!Better than the books.Bloody fun!"
3,Final Season Two Episode,"""Beyond Here Lies Lies Nothin'"" is the twelfth episode of season 2 and is the season finale. The last few episodes were weak and often bordered on just silly, and that carried through to the finale. No spoilers from me:This wraps up the various season story lines, with Sookie playing a bigger part in MaryAnn's plans than she would like. Sam accepts his fate (mostly). Jason and Andy still provide comic relief, again too much in my opinion.The ending again plants a hook for next season, which I hope gets closer to the books.It is rated TVMA so it is not for younger viewers.CFH"
3,Episode 11 of Season 2 - Weaker Than Most,"""Frenzy"" is the eleventh episode of season 2. This episode is a little weaker than most of the others and occasionally wanders into the just silly (especially with Jason). No spoilers from me:Sookie tries to handle things with MaryAnn and Tara while Eric seeks advice from a Vampire Queen. Tara crosses the line with Lafayette and Sookie. Jason and Andy once again provide comic relief, too much in my opinion.Like the last episode, this one was not my favorite but it did move along at a fairly good pace.It is rated TVMA so it is not for younger viewers.CFH"
3,My time machine is down for repairs... again!!!,"My time machine is in the shop. I wonder if one of you 63 (so far) who have reviewed this DVD set could pick me up a copy next time you travel to the future. I'm more than willing to pay the regular dollar as always, even though I know you will profit a gazillion times over when you make a quick stop yesterday to buy a lottery ticket with last night's winning numbers, but I'm ok with that. Oh, one more thing... I need this last week. So, thanks in advance. Or should I say... belated thanks, since you obviously will have already put it in my hands a week ago?"
3,Didn't live up to the hype for me.,"Lots of friends love this show. They've told me, ""watch it!"" Well, I watched an episode and it just didn't engage me. I appreciate the social commentary, but the characters and story lines didn't connect. I'm sure others may enjoy it greatly. I can't say it's ""bad"". It just didn't work for me."
2,Dissapointed...,"I absolutely LOVE True Blood and was very excited to purchase the second season to add to my collection. After I recieved the set of dvds, I found that the dvd holder was missing the outer sleeve. I looked past this because the dvds were still protected and the outer sleeve isn't all that important. HOWEVER, when I went to watch the fourth disc in the set, it was COMPLETELY recorded over loosing 3 episodes. Absolute dissapointment. I didn't order The Lion King, I ordered True Blood season 2. I wish the seller would've looked through the product thoroughly before they sold it."
3,my thoughts,"i really like the true blood series, but this price and the whole ""Connection Speed"" that keeps laging out... its Very annoying. i cant exactly watch what i paid a stupid ammount for if the damn connection keeps timing out. Thanks so much amazon...."
4,Great,"The DVD's came faster than promised, and all in good shape, ready for movie night...the extended version! I would consider another purchase for sure."
5,TRUEBLOODaholic!,"This by far is the best series that I have ever gotten into. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor, buy it!"
5,love true blood!,"I've heard a few reviews about Season 2 not being good at all, but my husband and I disagree! The show is addicting, no doubt about it, and we thought this season was great. If you are a real True Blood fan this is a must-have!"
3,No more Maryann,"I loved the first season. I loved the books. I also started out loving the second season. In the middle of the season it started spiraling down. Mainly when it started straying from the books. I understand it will not follow the books exactly, however, just because you add sex doesn't mean it will sell.(the orgy scenes is what I am refering to) Foreplay. Also the Maryann character dragged on and on. I did like that they kept Lafayette around. I would like to see season 3 come back around to the vampires and focus less on the supernatural characters for now. The first season was such a hit because of the vampires. I will buy the second season and just hope the third will improve."
2,Bloody Awful,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season, but the second became silly and--dare I say it--boring. The Maryann story-line dragged on much too long and robbed secondary characters of any personality since they were too busy being possessed to do anything of worth. The church group story arc at the season's start led nowhere, Bill (as interesting as dish water) was eclipsed by the far more enigmatic and interesting Eric, and Jason and the police deputy became ridiculous caricatures. Even poor Lafayette was robbed of his sass. If the third season doesn't pull things together quickly, I'm putting a stake through ""True Blood"" and calling it done."
2,a major disappointment,"I looked forward to this season for months, only to find it a slog though one boring episode after another. What made the writers think any of this would be of much interest? For example they seem to have little to say about Sookie and Bill once they affirmed their love. After their hot lovemaking scene there is little more than middle-age sex orgies in the rest of the season. Marianne was worth, at most, a few episodes, not the whole season, and the introduction of another shifter went nowhere. I'm left wondering if there is any reason to keep my DVDs when I can't see watching them again."
4,Good Deal,Great buy! wish it was not so grainy though.... guess that is why they offer the HD version. The series are great and download is quick.
4,I really enjoyed it,"I totally got into this show...parts of it are gross, parts are funny rather than dramatic but overall it's pretty good."
5,Very cool. A lot of fun,Bought this for the wife and she loves it. We spent about a week watching the show and all the extras. I highly recommend it.
5,Better than season one,I absolutely love this series. I havent read the books but i probably dont want to. Every episode leaves you wanting more. One of the craziest shows i have seen.
4,Great Show!,"True Blood is a great show. Really high quality as you would expect from HBO. The second season isn't as good as the first, but it's still pretty great!"
1,If you think Twilight is bad....,"Then don't bother with this series. Unless you like pointless sex and ridiculous violence. I prefer my vampires with more class, else I would just take werewolves."
1,very displeased,"this product was mailed to me damaged,ive attempted to contact this seller a total of 3 times to either get a replacement or refund and they will not answer any of my emails which is very unprofessional on their behalf. ive attempted to also contact amazon on this matter and all they told me was to contact the seller, which i also didnt appreciate!!!!"
5,Best Show Everrrr!,"Trueblood is the best show ever. I havent seen anything this good at all, if you dont like this show you fail at life :) and thats about it buy these dvd's now"
1,POOR,"Ordered True Blood 2nd season on 10/31/11, I have yet to receive it....It is now 12/3/11....I usually have very good luck with amazon, but after this I may not use amazon again. To post this review I must rate this item, since I've never gotten it, I'm not sure how to rate it, but I will give it a 1."
2,True Blood: The Complete Second Season (HBO Series),"Am rating the service, not the item, since I have not yet received it. Ordered on Feb 6. It is now March 10. The second hand supplier's service sucks."
2,scratched,"I got this item on a special sale for only $15. The day I got it, I took out my favorite disc, and played it. about halfway through my favorite episode, it started to jump. I was concerned, so I took the disc out and found a huge scratch in it. I'm talking like, a long chunk gauged out. I'm surprised it played at all. the 2 stars do not reflect the show, merely the fact that my favorite disc came scratched."
4,Works so far,"This pest ""stopper"" does just that. Since putting it up, no squirrels have been able to get to my bird feeders. I would have rated it higher, but it seems like it's not stable and may simply fall down at some time. Because of that it did take a bit of time to get secure on the post."
4,Better than most,"Very illuminating for a light that uses ""C"" batteries. Well constructed too. The rear button is easiest to use with your index finger instead of your thumb when holding it in your palm in the overhead postion."
4,no batteries with my flashlight,"Cannot say how it works, as there were no batteries included in the packaging. When I get batteries, I'll be able to comment."
2,WTH,"Very disappointed in this flashlight. I did a lot of research and this seemed like a good around-the-house or in-the-car choice despite the button on the bottom drawback. It hardly held a ""candle"" to my run of the mill MagLight 3 D cell w/ LED.Sending it back and I will try something else."
5,Tough!,"Great flashlight, and ultratough! I dropped it several feet and it landed on on its end on concreate, and the light went out. I thought it was a goner, but when I took the batteries out I found that the batteries had caved in. I replaced the batteries, and the flashlight was fine!"
3,Not easy,"The Carousel was not easy to put together! I like to say I'm pretty good at putting all the kids stuff together, but these directions were not clear. But it is really cute when it is finally put together."
3,Good product/HORRIBLE instructions!,"The product, once assembled is nice, but good luck assembling it using only four small illustrations!!! Also, the metal casing inside one of the green supports that is meant to hold the screw in, completely fell out! Luckily it is not a moving component or else it wouldn't have worked. I just stuck in back in the hole with the screw already screwed into it and sandwiched it between two shelves. I have assembled a LOT of furniture and this piece was by far the most challenging! Unfortunately, my daughter is not even using it."
5,Nice piece of kids furniture that should get a lot of use,"We purchased this item as part of a larger gift for my 3-year-old daughter. The plan was to make a ""dress-up"" closet for her packed with Halloween costumes we'd purchased earlier in the year. After a few frustrating minutes putting it together due to some parts we put on backwards, it came together pretty quickly. I was impressed that the parts of the frame are pretty substantial and seem to be quality. I can see this carousel evolving into a more practical, day-to-day storage piece as my daughter gets older."
4,Great for Play and Organization,"I bought this for my 3 year old girl. Now she doesn't hesitate to put her dress up clothes away. The cubbies and hooks makes it easy for her to grab things and then put them back in their place. The mirrors on the sides are flimsy, but they still work. Our daughter loves it."
3,Price went up,Use to be able to buy these for less then $20 a piece but the website we got them at no longer carries them.
4,Classic Headgear,The product arrived within 72 hours of the order and we are pleased with the purchase.
4,Red Magic,"Overall the book was slow starting, however after the first chapter the book then became interesting with a climatic end. Would recommend to novice fantasy readers."
1,"It is DUBBED -- in other words, RUINED so BEWARE","I rented (instant play) the film ""Stone Council"" for 3.99. It is a French film, and I expected to see and hear Monica Belucci in the main role. I was shocked to find that it is DUBBED!?! My husband and I stopped watching immediately, deeply disappointed.I feel strongly that you (AMAZON) should explain that it is dubbed, as this is a major consideration in watching any film. It basically ruins it. Furthermore, I would appreciate a refund, as had I known that it was dubbed, I would never ever have rented it.Thank you in advance for your help. I hope my feedback helps you to continue to be awesome, as you usually are. Just not this time, sadly."
3,It's a dub!!!!!!!,"I like the movie, not the best of its genre but kept me entertain the whole time and i LOVE Monica Bellucci. My big complaint is that the film is dubbed! and has no option for original audio with subtitles..."
5,Good book,Even though it is very old the story and message behind it are timeless. It was for my twelve year old son. A few of the chapters were a bit long but full of historical information.
5,excited,"I and my husband are excited to find that we could still get this book. We have a very old one and suspected that it was out of print, But Amazon was able to get one for us anyway! Hooray!!"
5,Very inspiring,This book was awesome. So inspiring. The whole way through he used analogies from events in his life to the Christian walk and it was just so good. His faith in God was amazing. I would recomend it to anyone. It is deffinately a keeper and a re-reader.
5,A Remarkable book for Men,This man's innovations changed the way we build major infrastructure in the world. From a early involvement in auto racing to the most powerful earth moving equipment of his times. R.G. LeTourneau changed the way we build and power the big machines. You may not know his name as CATAPILLAR bought all his patents and his heavy equipment company . This is a inspirational book as you see how difficulties are over come and you see how he increased his giving to Gods work and the many times that his motivation to build was directly driven by his desire to advance the Kingdom of God.
5,Great Book,"This, to me, was a good example that you don't have to be cut throat to run a successful business. You don't have to be a Harvard graduate. You just need to be energized to help other people the best way you know how, and not be afraid of change, but be excited about innovation."
5,God the best business partner.,Loved the book. God truly is the best business partner a man could ever find. I've been wanting to read this for months and it was all I hoped it would be.
3,Book was okay.,Someone recommended this book to me. It was a good book. I know he has many followers that think everything he wrote was the greatest. I guess at the time he wrote this the book was ahead of its time.
5,High quality images and text typical of Motorbooks,Excellent book particularly for those new to the subject. fantastic colour images combined with first hand accounts of the air war in Korea.
1,This movie is terrible,"You ever see a movie so bad it gives you a headache. Well this pile of junk gave my a terrible migrane just watching it, It is supose to be a parody of silence of the lambs. Mel Brooks parody of Bram Stokers Dracula ""Dracula dead and loving it"" is far superior and that is not saying much. This asinine garbage is painful to watch."
4,A Hidden Gem,"If you like the humor of movies like Spaceballs and Airplane, then you will like Silence of the Hams. Obviously, it is mainly a parody of Silence of the Lambs, but other movies are also spoofed (Psycho, Jurassic Park, and more). The laughs are a mixed bag, but there are enough to keep most entertained. Writer/Director Ezio Greggio appears as Norman Bates spoof Antonio Motel. Also note cameos by Joe Dante, John Carpenter, Mel Brooks, and others."
5,This ATV is amazing!,"We bought this ATV for my son for his 2nd birthday in September. He loves it! This quad is super easy for him to ride and goes on just about any surface! He loves riding it our front on the street and tearing up the neighbors nice rock front yards! It's two speed option was an advantage but to be honest he only ever goes one speed......fast! He has so much fun on this quad, it is easy to steer, his coordination skills have really improved just riding this thing...The 12volt battery lasts about 4 hours which considering how he drives it I feel is pretty good.My only complaint about this quad would be the wheels and honestly if he just road it on the road it would be fine but he likes to off road on the rocks and dirt and the back wheels ended up getting pretty torn up! We just got some old bike tire rubber and stuck it on the wheels which he loves because it gives him more traction!This ATV will give your kids endless hours of fun!"
5,Our twins love em!,We bought two of these for our twin boys and they LOVE them. We were quite impressed how they plow through mud and don't get stuck. The batteries last a long time too. Highly recommended for hours of fun!
4,Great fun,"This toy is great. My son knows his dad and grandad are golfers and he likes to join in. The only problem is that this is more at Toys R US for $24.99. Little Tikes even only sells it for $19.99. It's overpiced but other than that, we love it!"
3,Odd design - but fun toy,"When you first put this together you will find it odd that the ""cart"" needs 2.5"" steel screws. It's not structural so it seems a little overkill.Secondly, it would have been a better design if the ""hole"" went into, or attached itself to the cart, but oh well.Fun product - even with the design shortcomings."
4,Great Toy!,"wow...I bought this toy for my daughter a few months ago when she was1 1/2 years old... she likes the toy but does not play with it everyday... I had no idea this toy was soooo expensive... I would never spend this amount of money on it... when I got it, it was on clearance for less than 10.00...it's a good thing that I decided to get it when I did!!... Overall, the toy is very durable/sturdy and will last a long time..."
3,Fun Toy But ...,"This is a fun toy for my 3 year-old boy, but the set was shipped without a golf ball. Was on hold waiting to talk to someone for a replacement ball for over 11 minutes. Once someone answered, it was no problem to get my request filled. They said it would be delivered in ""7-10 days if not sooner.""Follow up .. the golf balls did arrive on January 13--18 days after I made the call."
4,A good golf starter,"This is a very simple and durable golf set for toddlers. It is easy to assemble and simple to use. We got this set for our son when he was two year old, but he didn't play with it very much because his motor skills weren't developed enough to really have fun with it. He would try to hit the ball and miss it a lot, which was very frustrating for him. He likes it much more now that he is almost three and he can hit the ball more consistently in a direction of his choosing.I would recommend this toy for toddlers at least three years old rather than the two years recommended by the manufacturer."
5,Top ten toy for toddlers,"We received this toy as a gift when my son was almost two. Now a year later, I'm buying a replacement - we have played with this so much in in our driveway that he's worn a hole in the bottom of one of the clubs! Not that this set isn't durable, but it has seen a lot of action at our house. It's been one of if not the most popular toy with my son for an entire year. It's nice that there are two clubs as well so that other children or mom/dad can join in. We lost the balls that came with it quickly but wiffleballs or practice golf balls work great as replacements."
4,My grand-daughter's favorite,"My grand-daughter enjoys watching Bob the Builder on my Fire HD. It is one of the few shows her Mummy allows her to watch. When we have quiet time, she generally chooses one of the many Bob the Builder videos and loves to sing along with the introduction. Mummy says the programs teach good values in a fun way."
5,GREAT salt/pepper ginder combo,"Our first version of this grinder finally gave out after 25 years of daily use, so we ordered a replacement. This newer version works flawlessly and I expect to get another 25 years of use from it. That works out to about a dollar a year, and I call it a bargain."
4,Very listenable album.,"Actually, I only have a tape of this recording but I like it. This is not that serious, heavy or dark but the music is very enjoyable. Vocalist sounds like gentle/smooth John Wetton and overall sound has fusion taste with pretty songwrithing. I haven't heard of the other recordings but I think this is a kind of opposite end from Anekdoten or Anglagard. Try it!"
2,A MOSTLY DISAPPOINTING HOUR,"I am a Shakira fan and hoped for some performance clips mixed in with this biography. At no time in the ~1/2 hour play time, do we ever hear Shakira sing or speak. However there are many passages when we see her sing and speak while another person narrates related info. The video quality is fair, at best. The audio quality is poor. Three unknown, but well-informed, fans comprise much of the biography. With much narration, this is a good summary of her history and an excellent recap of her significant career events. The typical FBI warning about not making unauthorized copies of this DVD are published, however it would be a waste of time, media and resources to make such a copy. If you want my copy, it will be for sale at the Amazon used category soon."
3,Not that great,You can tell all of the musical instruments (piano included) are done on an electronic keyboard. Not what I was wanting.
2,"Rushed, too many titles","Frustrating if you like to sing along. Of course, if you only know one verse, this may be for you!"
2,Disappointing,"This album has a very ""canned"" sound and certainly is not done with acoustic instruments (yes, there is a difference). Piano is the featured instrument and, while played well, it seems to get quite percussive after you've listened to about three numbers. One gets a large quantity (102 songs)but I'd opt for quality over the quantity."
1,"Misleading Title, it has nothing to do with Biology","This is just another basic book on how to use Linux, that's all. It comes with a fancy title ""Computational Biology"" but it has nothing to do with that subject."
5,Great read!,"T Cooper manages to combine two very different (yet also quitesimilar) stories with two very different voices intoone page-turning novel. Unique characters, combinedwith a unique writing style make for a veryinteresting, witty, and enjoyable read."
3,This author has potential,Five stars would have best described this book if the author had cut it short after Esther's story ended. The last semi-autobiographical part felt contrived and forced; the voice did not ring true for me. This author has tons of potential. I'll be on the look out for her next book.
2,Half of a Good Read,"The first 316 pages of this novel were very absorbing. The author should have quit there. The remaining 114 pages or so are a complete disappointment. I tried to buy into the plot - but it was increasingly more difficult to buy. In addition, the more I read, the farther I strayed from the initial story. I should have began a completely new novel instead of trying to finish this one. Disappointing."
2,"enough horrors, already.","The writing's all right, for the first hundred pages or so, but the content was unrelentingly dismal so I left off. I don't really need to be shown in vivid detail what Russian bigots did to some poor Jewish girl, what a skull fracture looks & smells like, or what heartbroken women do to themselves with razors, or children, desperate to be liked, with whatever they can find. After a while I told myself, ""If this character does X, I'm putting the book down,"" X being an obvious and ill-chosen action; he did, and I did."
3,The Dean Koontz of rap literature?,"One thing about reading Stephen King is when you read the Dean Koontz remake of the same story, the latter usually pales in comparison!Having read EminemsRevenge's ""Jew Girl"" which became available here on Amazon last September, and KNOWING that EminemsRevenge had previewed parts of his book on the Internet over the past couple of years, I have to wonder if T Cooper was also privy to those previews. Mixing Judaism with rap is a precarious balancing act that requires more of a Public Enemy approach than the insane ""My Adidas"" clown posse approach of Run DMC...and ER's Coltrane be-boppish ""rap"" style of writing seems more apropos for the subject.T Cooper is more accesible though, since EminemsRevenge is more a latter-day James Joyce, so I would go to Cooper if I wanted a quick and uncomplicated read...but ER IS the master blaster when it comes to LITERARY rap!"
3,Just Not Compelling,"First, let me say this... I think I am the only one who did not care for this book. It was a well-written and well-researched novel. It was just not a compelling story for me. I never got involved with the characters, and I never understood why the fell in love. The development of the relationship between the characters was sacrificed for the plot of the book. In the end the story was an OK read but not memorable to me. Plus, I never understood the attraction to the main character. He was entirely devoid of humor and personality."
1,Too Pat,"I am so tired of authors thinking they can get away with ridiculous descriptive phrases like ""the sensations of his magic touch led her to madness,"" or ""gentle caresses created streaks of concentrated pleasure."" What the heck are streaks of concentrated pleasure, and PALEEEEASE, ""his magic touch""? Give me more, give me something I can lose myself in, I just cannot get into termanology like that. The story had potential, but the characters were annoying, especially Christiana. She was so stupid, and her childishness was not endearing, it grated on my nerves."
3,By Arrangement,"I enjoyed the love story between David and christina, but I was confused about some of the story itself. I found myself having to go back and reread to see if I had missed anything along the way. I could not remember all of the characters since most were not described fully enough for me. I would have to go back in the book sometimes to figure out whom David or Christina were talking about. The bother was fully described, but I feel she could have given him a little more romance than she did. The author could almost write a novel just about the brother and i'm sure it would be a hit."
5,Another great medieval!,"Medievals are becoming my favorite genre to read in romance and this book is one of the prime examples. While not a real fast moving story, the characters are like real people walking around in a real world of Old England. I actually read some of the other books in this series before this one, so, it was nice to come back and read about the David and Christiana that I knew from the other books, only before they were together. Their love story was very believable and I liked the secret about David. I also liked seeing the warrior Morvan in this book again. He's my favorite MH hero so far! *S* I am looking forward to Ms. Hunter's next tale!"
2,"Yawn, 2 1/2 stars","Sorry, I must have read a really GOOD book before I started this one...I could not finish it. I made it to just beyond the wedding and I just could not make myself complete it. It may have just been a matter of bad timing for me... I don't know.I liked the characters, David, much more than Chritiania, but I just was not that interested in the intrigue. I guess it was not intriguing enough. Maybe if it had some humor in it I could have stayed interested...?The love scenes were a little flat for me. I switched to a Gaelen Foley book instead and could not put it down for the first 150 pages....It is much more exciting and passionate and intriguing, and they haven't even had sex yet!Get the Hunter book if you want a bland romance in a historical setting, not too exciting to get your self worked up about. Sorry, I really wanted to like it, and it is not like me to leave abook unfinished. I will give her another try with another title...regards & good reading."
2,I know I'm in the minority!,"However, I feel the need to give a contrasting opinion. I bought this book based on all the online rave reviews, but I was very disappointed. The story was very dull. The paperback I read is 389 pages long, and my interest was not gained until the last 100 pages or so. The political storyline was dull mainly because we had no details until the end of the book - just mysterious 'hints' throughout. And David's personality came off as being more uneven and inconsistent rather than three dimensional. I would not recommend this book. But as I said, I am in the minority..."
2,"""No Good""","I'm so glad in didn't read this before reading ""by possession"" and By design"" Because I would not have read them after reading By Arrangement. This book started out okay and as the story went on it got progressively boring. It was really hard for me to get through. Too much plotting took away from the romance of the story. The romantic scenes were not that good. The hero and heroine were just ok. All in all it was very dull. But MD made up for it with next following series."
4,a must read,I did enjoy this book. The only problem was that i'm use to reading books were the charators are more important then the setting. Hunter prefers to write more on what is happening aroung the charators rather then the charators themselves. Overall this was a great book and i enjoyed reading it and recomment it to anyone who loves to read romance novels.
4,Fun Flick,"Fun movie with good action,good cast and some pretty funny moments.It has a really cool twist to it too. i would recommend this film to others."
4,A must see,"Great story, great plot, and good comedy. The Immortals is one of those movies that you will never see an equal to."
2,Tarantino ripoff by terrible writer,"This was obviously a movie that was rushed out to ride the wave of success that other movies caught in the wake of Reservoir Dogs, and other Tarantino flicks from the time. The difference is that while Tarantino is a fantastic Writer/Director, this film had neither. It seems obvious that both were just trying to make a Tarantino film, and neither had the talent to pull off a decent copy. Not worth it. Stay away."
2,Don't bother,Improbable characters in stupid situations trying to steal money.Lots of shooting but the characters refuse to die and end the movie.
4,Not bad!,"Eight misfit criminals unite to simultaneous steal from various targets in the city. Of course it all goes bad, predictable but still fun and entertaining. There's a lot of gunfire, explosions, tough-guys and a gal, and some humor thrown in. It translates to a very good action-thriller. Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts, is as good as he was in Runway Train (he was nominated for an Academy Award for in 1985). At the end of this film you might be surprise who the real target is! It's worth your time, however it is only available in limited quantities, you'll have to order it and wait. But it's worth it. By the way, Chris Rock is true to form and he'll make you laugh! Rate R for strong language and violence."
4,A great cast!!!!,"this is a great ""b"" movie that should've done better than it did.The castis great, and Eric Roberts is his usual cool self.A good movie that HBOused to show at 4am in the morning, and I was happy to get on DVD!!"
5,not somthing for the kids,"Very funny ,We injoyed it alot but DON'T LET THE KIDS WATCH IT ,good production ,good graphics,really funny I would have to get it again if something happened to the one I have"
2,CD REVIEW,I LIKE MAX BYGRAVES'S MUSIC BUT THIS CD IS A DISAPPOINTMENT.. IT IS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST CD'S -SORRY MAX!
1,pirate blanket,"The company definitely uses the word 'deluxe' very loosely....i wouldn't even call it a 'blanket'...maybe a light throw. It came in a very small package that a pillow case would have filled up. They said it was originally $49.99, but i'm sure if anyone actually paid that price, they would return it for a full refund! I paid $14.99...not sure if it's really worth that either, but i'm keeping it because i have a grandson that is in a 'pirate' stage so it would look cute as a hanger on his wall or a throw across his comforter on his bed. If you are looking for a pirate blanket for warmth, this is not the one!!!"
4,"One romantic song: ""Room in your heart""","I am totally agree with the comment of Carlos Galvalizi from Buenos Aires. I live here too and I was trying hard to find this CD, but it seems that it is not available. I think this is a song to be listened with your couple. I strongly suggest to play it in company."
2,ROOM IN YOUR HEART IS SPECIAL,"I do not like much the music by this group but ROOM IN YOUR HEART is a special case. I find it is one of the sweetest melodies I heard in the last six months. I heard it on one FM here in Buenos Aires and I could not find it in the CD stores here, not even in Tower Records."
5,Room in your heart,This is a song that touches my very heart and relates to my in person. I tried looking for it to use for my wedding but could find it. But know I find at in this site and I strongly recommend it for love of Love Songs.
2,Too much history - not enough style,"I puchased this book expecting Hilfiger's guidance in what clothes to purchase, and how to develop my wardrobe for work and social situations. What I got was a history book - history of Hilfiger and of various styles (denim, suits, shoes, shirts etc.). Though informative, I was looking for a guide and this book does not meet that goal. The book was interesting but not useful. Probably best used as a ""coffee table"" book."
3,rs review,The book was OK.the book did not have that much info on him what if for say someone was doing a report on him where would they get the info from he has only that book on him it did have that much of any thing on him some stuff on him but not in detail the book was semi good for a design book but thats it
2,I like them but can't get them in!,"I like these, they're super cute, but I can't get them in after I taper because the ends are flared!"
4,Darker than it appears in the picture.,"This is a beautiful tray, but is much darker than the copper shade depicted in the photo. It's almost a chocolate brown. I still love it, just wish it were more coppery in color."
1,Soldier Songs Home-Front Ballads of Civil War,Wish there had been more original music. Most of songs collected in this anthology are just new words to other songs. The Library of Congress has a wealth of original songs from that era which I thought might have been included but were not.
2,"Useful, but dated","This reprint of the 1985 second edition of ""Linguistics"" does offer some insights into the study of language. These insights are mainly to be garnered from Crystal's often amusing coverage of the history of the emergence of linguistics as an art and a science. I found the book somewhat helpful but limited in that it is written from the viewpoint of the mid-eighties and so does not cover developments since then."
2,A book for students,"Linguistics is supposed a difficult subject for students. This book is a good book for students.It explain about the topics that what is linguistics and what is not linguistics and what are advantages to study the linguistics. The writer gives informations about some other books of linguistics which may be useful for students.I thank that this book is ,also,useful for a common man who want to know primary informations about linguistics ,but it don't satisfy a scholar who want to research about important schools of linguistics or origin of language."
5,We Could Make Such Beautiful Music Together,"it is a disk beautiful, it is one of the best interpretations of Bebo Valdes"
3,OK FOR THE PRICE,"I BOUGHT THIS ALONG W/SCRAPBOOK FACTORY DELUX 4.0. OF THE 2 I REALLY PREFER SCRAPBOOK FACTORY DELUX. CK SCRAPBOOKING'S GRAPHICS ARE MOSTLY CHEEZY CLIP ART TYPE. I DID CREATE SOME DECENT PAGES WITH IT THOUGH. HOWEVER IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ONE THAT CREATES MORE REALISTIC PAGES, GO FOR THE SCRAPBOOK FACTORY DELUX. IT IS WELL WORTH THE EXTRA $."
4,Creating Keepsakes Scrapbooking (Jewel Case),I'm very satisfied with the product I purchased through Amazon.
1,Fun junk,"If the title caught your eye, then you probably are not looking for something too high minded. You have found it. ""Dream"" has Edmond O'Brien in it at the end of his career. A woman's deadly delusions lead to the demise of a dimwitted denizen. The other is a skin romp. There are better examples, there are worse."
2,Expecting Miracles,"Expect Miracles is a wonderful book if you have never heard of charter schools before. The first section of the book presents all of the information one would need if they were in the market for starting their own charter school. However, if you are looking for information past what a charter school is and how one would go about forming one, I would not recommend this book.The second section of the text is aimed at being more of a theoretical nature. Unfortunatly, many of the arguements in this section are very abbreviated and not fully formed. Also, there is a definite bias in which support in terms of other research is not provided to the reader.In all if you are looking for an objective look at charter schools, this is probably not the ideal book to read."
2,Not what I expected,I'm Rather disappointed with this product. The cup size is not a regular40.The bodice is fine but the bra portion of it is a let down.
1,Unreliable and poorly made,"I am very unhappy with my Sharp Viewcam. After only 6 cassettes of movies, it is broken beyond repair. It simply stopped working and the repair shop said it would cost too much to fix. Unfortunately, the warranty expired so I'm at a total loss. I will never buy another Sharp product in my life."
1,not long lasting,"My Sharp viewcam broke about 6 months after the 1 year warranty. I loved the ease of the camera, but now it would cost me more to repair it than it was to buy it. I took great care of the camera and used it often to film my new baby. One day I tried to watch a tape I recorded a day before and the tape got stuck in the camera and wouldn't do anything! I would absolutely shop around with other brands before buying this Sharp product."
1,Inside Noise,"I received this camcorder for Christmas. I have always had a noise coming from the inside of the camcorder. In the beginning the noise wasn't that noticeable. But over time the noise had gotten louder. I used the recommended cleaning tapes, but didn't seem to work. According to the manual, there's the possibility of the video head being worn. The repair will cost to much to fix. I have a friend with the same camcorder, and hers is broke also. The only difference between the two, is mine will still record, but the noise is louder, and hers won't record at all. There are a lot better choices than this camcorder."
5,Great for basketball games!,"With two boys starting on the varsity basketball team here in Roberts, Montana, this camera has been GREAT! Good, clear picture and easy to handle. MUCH better than my old one! Thanks!"
1,Not a product for beginners!,"I bought this program after getting a digital camera and wanting to ""play"" with AND improve my images taken. I bought this program based on it's packaging. They make it sound great. However, upon getting it home, became frustrated very quickly. For someone with no experience, your totally on your own. I knew I would have to experiment and learn on my own, but there is no manual, the help menu's are, at best, minimal and offer no help, merely a description of what the icon does. Save your money and search, like I should have, for a program that is more user-friendly WITH a manual for learning!"
4,date shoes,"I love the color on these shoes, they go with anything. If you are like me and cant rock the heels yet, then you will love this pump, it looks great with jeans or slacks. The price was great and who doesnt love super saver shipping????"
4,"great look, smidge stiff","I love these shoes. They are classy and pump up any outfit. My only complaint is that they are just a smidge stiff, but I haven't worn them enough to break them in. I'm hopeful that they'll loosen up a bit."
1,Don't be fooled,"I was wanting some red shoes for an upcomming event and these seemed perfect. The website showed a red smooth patent leather shoe and I loved the heel heigth. However, when the shoes arrived they were rough in texture, not patent leather. I would have been ok with them if they had been the red croc skin ones also avaiable, but they were neither of the red shoes shown on the site. I was extremely dissapointed, so I have returned the shoes. Amazon was quick to refund the money, but I had to quickly look elsewhere to find the red patent leather shoes I had thought I was receiving from Amazon. The heel heigth and the Berry style look great, but not in the color and texture I received. Don't trust the picture, because it is extremely missleading."
2,Disappointed,"I have several pairs of Bandolino shoes in this exact style (Berry) which I love. This pair turned out to be all man-made material (synthetic) rather than leather, like my other 3 pair, so shoes were less comfortable or breathable.The synthetic material had a strong chemical odor, which might have dissapated over time but I did not want to take a chance on that. The styles which state they are leather would be a better purchase."
4,Great pair of shoes but.....,"I purchased three pairs of these pumps because of the fit and the fact that they are comfortable. The height of the heel is good for walking around without squishing your toes. The shoes work well to enhance any outfit, pants or skirt. However, the major flaw of them relate to how they are made. The shoe is glued to the sole and in some cases the material look as if they are ready to be pull away from the sole of the shoe."
2,White Berry Pump Review,"These shoes looked very nice on the web. But when I got them out of the box, I knew right away that they would not feel good. The toe is too pointed, so there is not much room for your toes to be comfortable. I usually wear a 7.5, but these were too small, felt even smaller with the pointed toe, and were also stiff.I do not recommend these unless you only plan to wear them for short periods at a time."
3,"Look good, comfortable, but had heel issues","first off, these shoes look good --- very professional. nice with both pants and skirts. the height is nice, not too tall to walk around all day or thru airports. i wore them until i was 7 months pregnant and consistently found them as comfortable as flats. the only issue is that after about 4 months of use the bottom part of the heel came off. considering the price, i didn't find it worth it to take to a cobbler and get repaired. i was disappointed."
5,Phenomenal shoes!,"I bought these in dark brown suede (which is actually much darker than it looks, fortunately) and black leather in a size 5. I typically find even size 5's to run a bit large, either too long, too wide, or both. These shoes, on the other hand, fit perfectly, even without doctoring them up with heel pads, etc. (which I usually have to do). They are beautiful, and I love the height of the heel - not too high, not too low, just right. Since I'm a scientist, I work in a lab and I'm on my feet a lot, yet I need to look professional at the same time. These shoes do it all!"
3,I'm not a pointy toe type of gal,"Let me start off by saying, if you like pointy toe shoes, then these are probably a good fit for you. I wear a size 7 and they made my feet look like a size 12. I have been desperately looking for a pair of navy pumps (with low heels) to wear with a suit for a job interview and I haven't found anything, and when I saw these I was so excited. The price is amazing as the same shoes are about $30 more on a popular shoe website. The shade of blue is beautiful, and they are so comfortable. I did have some toe cleavage,but I just couldn't get past the size of that point. I could have killed a family of roaches that were nestled in a corner with the tips. Just from the comfort level, I'm going to look for some Bandolino shoes (with rounded toes)"
2,not to size,This shoe was not to size. I ordered in wide and could not even get my foot in it. Wide was more like med B size.
2,Right shoe was lob-sided,"I like the shoe shape for variety in my shoe collection but I was disappointed that the right shoe was slightly lob-sided ie. when wearing it, the right feet 'wobbles' abit. Looking at the shoes, one can see that the right side is lob-sided. I would have returned them to Amazon/the seller had it not been for the shipping costs. I live in Asia and it cost way too much. And I must add that it's a pity when sellers sell and send out such inferior products. I hope Amazon do take note of such complains."
4,Happy with condition and shipping,"This product was advertised as ""used"", which made me hesitate to buy it. However, it arrived in perfect condition without any signs of wear.ETA for arrival was estimated at 10-14 days. We were happy and surprised when it arrived in three days.Overall, I am completely satisfied with both product and shipping."
3,Foot massager,"I purchased this massager. Over-all it is fair, but a little hard to get used to at first. It is similar to accupuncture. It is unlike other foot massagers. If your have very sensitive feet ,then I would NOT recommend this product."
3,Not made of Copper,"I made the mistake of thinking this was made of copper - unfortunately, it is not. I used a rust remover to clean it and the copper plate/color came right of. Oh well!"
2,...,"I don't know why there are ten perfect reviews. This book bored me almost to tears. I couldn't understand why it had been rated so high, and I had been wanting to buy this book for so long. Now I'm sorry I did. I couldn't finish it. Con was just rude, we never got to see inside Val's mind or read about how she felt at all, and the writing was just...not very good. It was so uninteresting, but I gave it two stars because I think it could have been good. But I don't like Kantra's style."
5,My favorite,"This was my favorite novel growing up -- I read it and re-read it. For me, the novel served an unusual function -- it introduced me to NYC (some place alien to a kid living a sheltered suburban existence) and provided me with a reading list of authors to read to expand my intellectual horizons."
3,"Good, but c'mon...","I just watched the dvd. Okay, very funny, and a nice little discovery. But jeez, the reviewers here need to get a grip. It's not Monty Python, it's not Black Adder. Just a cute little diversion that needs to be accepted for what it is. Yes I enjoyed it and I'm glad I got it, but it will not change your life. Have fun people, but every brit com that you 'discover' is not the holy grail. Look around you."
2,VINEGAR MOUTH INDEED !,"This story is about a wild undisciplined 18 year old GIRL who answers a want-a-bride ad from a rancher in Montana.This girl has an attitude problem with God on the first page and doesn't like men in general.She doesn't deserve what she GETS IN THE END.This book contains a few bad words and sex talk. I have read much better from this author. I hope this is not the case of "" write what you know"" .Dissappointed !"
5,Excelente Calidad (Review from Colombia! =] ),"Los tennis llegaron en su caja original, con sus marquillas de fabrica... Los he usado algunos dias, y son muy suaves al caminar. Espero que me duren tanto como lo que me han durado los demas tennis Adidas que he comprado anteriormente. El unico punto débil de los tennis blancos es que hay que cuidarlos un poco mas de lo normal para evitar que el deterioro normal se haga más evidente debido a que resalta mucho sobre el blanco. Por lo demás, ¡los recomiendo!"
5,Great Stetson Shirt,"I ordered a Setson Snap Denim Stonewash Shirt for myself and I must say that it is a great looking, great feeling shirt with superb craftmanship.I definitely will be telling my friends where to shop and what to buy."
4,Nice Heavy Grate,"Old grate burnt out.Searched and found this one, BEST price/value for a cast-iron grate, even after shipping.One negative is that feet are a little short, not much clearance underneath for fire-starting material. Thus only 4 Stars: * * * *Edit: (January, 2013)Current price shows at $69I paid nowhere *near* that price in 2008.At $69, it's not just a poor value, it's ""stupid expensive""."
2,Difficult to Use,"Because this book combines info about two linked but different tribes, it was difficult to sort out for a 10 year old writing a 10 page research paper on only the Apaches. Other books in this category were much more useful."
4,"""Enchantment""","Ambra returns with a different sound, a more mature one, both musically and lyrically.Really worth buying!"
3,loads of action,"you will love it.it's worth your money and time....if you did like it, email me if you do."
2,"This is good, but the Net is better","This is a good review of SWLing and pirate radio, but the Internet is better.Of particular notice is the typeface selected by the publisher. It is bizarre--meant as a display typeface, I'm sure. The effect is that this book is almost impossible to read and frankly, it hurts my eyes."
4,Great for free radio lovers,"I did buy the book and I have been reading it completely.And I did learn my friends. I am a pirate radio operator for years but still nice things to find out about Pirating. I like it a lot and also nice to see how other stations are doing it and finding out about their history's.Also the book to buy if you want to tune in to al kinds of pirate radio like TV,hf,vhf,internet,fm. You name it."
3,Mediocre -- there are better ones,I got 3 of these solar system things at once for our five year old who's into it right now. They were roughly same price. This was the least impressive of the 3. The 2D shapes and chinsey mobile hanger make it a 2nd rate solution. I'd go for the 3D balls instead.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THE MOBILE IS USELESS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I TOOK THE PLANETS BY THMESELVES AND PASTED THEM TO MY SON'E CEILING. IF THATS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO, THEN I WOULD SAY BUY THIS, BUT IF YOU THINK THE MOBILE LOOKS COOL, BEWARE, ITS NOT."
3,Not the real story.,"I have seen the band The Imperial Orgy live and this CD has little do with the great music they do in concert. The 3 songs that are by the band don't really sound like them, and most of the songs are by other artists and poets that they help to get heard. Some are good - I like Koester and Heather MIlburn, but Clint Starr and some of the others aren't so pleasant.The only song that hints at how good they really are is ""Happy Endings."""
1,Stanley Mobile Work Center,"Rewiew,The product arrived broken the latch holding the top tool box to the bottom box was broken and missing,the product was replaced the replacement arrived broken in the same place as the original, the tool box was not usable in the condition it arrived.My assessment the master shipping box was double the size necessary on both items,the boxes arrived with crushed corners and little or no dunnage wrap to secure the tool boxes in the outer box.I am still waiting for my credit.Sincerely William Brennan"
4,Stanley Consumer Storage,"I am pleased with this tool box, but then I did not purchase it for it's originally designed purpose but rather to carry my samples and inventory for my Slumber Parties by Debbie O business. I have now tried 2 different tool boxes and each has it pros and cons. I can tell you that it has helped immensely when it comes to saving space in my car. The fact that it comes apart is a tremendous plus. It is not designed for a lot of weight, I wish the plastic were more rigid and once loaded it doesn't roll really well. But it serves the purpose for now. I cannot imagine actually transporting heavy tools in this unit though. I have a lot of product stuffed into this, but it's not much weight and yet it bows out the sides so the top box isn't a snug fit onto the bottom box. All in all, I am pleased with it as I am using it."
2,Stanley Consumer Storage 018602R Mobile Work Center w/Soft Front Pocket,"This unit is nice for the home consumer to wheel out of the garage for ocassional use. Otherwise, a very cheap design for any other level of use. Stanley really skimped when they elected to use two plastic hinges as opposed to a metal piano style hinge. Also, the fold out handle is about 15 inches too short for pulling this unit. Becaue of the short handle the unit constantly bangs into your legs. Amazing that a ""tool"" manufacturer would skimp on design like this.Do not recommend."
5,Really Nice Book,"Bought , this book for my dad who is into Clay Pipes was really looking on how to make them."
1,Not a good show,Don't know if this overrated band was off this particular night or what but this is terrible live music.
4,Live at Reading,Another Christmas gift for my son. This was a last minute purchase and I was pleased to see it was in stock and ready to ship. Another hard to find item but Amazon rocks and shipping was fast.
3,I got this book on recommendation,"I got this book on recommendation from my counselor. It was ok but I didn't think it applied to my circumstances at the time. It's a quick read, but I would suggest seeing if the library has it."
5,An Unforgettable Classic - Read this in one sitting,"I read this book about 5 years ago when I was in the process of starting a business - this book was a powerful motivating force. Exceptionally well written and simple - but yet makes a deep impact. The story of two caterpillars and their discovery of their paths - is a beautiful love story, a story of hope, a story of entrepreneurship and risk taking. The book is laid out with a picture on every page and very little text. I would strongly recommend that this book should be read in a single sitting for maximum impact. It is a book you would always fondly remember!Another recommendation - It would be worthwhile to own a hardcover edition!"
5,an insightful read,"I must admit to having low expectations for this book when my friend forced me to borrow it. Much to my surprise, I was captivated by it! What an insightful little ditty - an easy read with many layers and levels in which to lose yourself in thought."
5,a book about growth,"A beautiful book about unconditional love and the willingness to let go of the familiar things that feel safe and comfortable, however unfulfilling in our lives.It's about taking risks and having the faith and trust that there is more meaning to life and the curiosity to take the chance to change. I have given this book to many friends,daughters and granddaughters and each time I order one I reread it. I can never keep a copy because every time I order one for myself, there is always someone to give it to."
5,A Masterpiece of the topic of Growth Oriented Living,"This book is something which can speak to people in all the many stages of life. It guides you through the lives of two small creatures as they discover their respective places in the universe at large. Bonus: the illustrations are fantastic.On a more personal note- this book has taken its place in my very exclusive collection of books which I keep throughout life. It will likely be enormously helpful to my children as they grow, and may provide me an entirely new learning experience when I reread it to them."
5,As true for caterpillars as it is for us,I love the challenge of reading it thinking that it's about caterpillars. And flowers. Because it is.And we trample both underfoot everyday.
3,"Hippie-esque, But That's Not Totally A Bad Thing","Written in a time when metaphorical escapist novels like Jonathan Livingston Seagull and Watership Down were moving from cult hits to mainstream, this equally anthropomorphic book about the love between two caterpillars, Yellow and Stripe, is a bit odd, but even those not stoned or on acid can find a pleasant message about overcoming the odds by doing your best. This book hasn't aged well but it holds the aura of the era it came out of and lets you sense the values and ideals of that age. Once you get past the strangeness of the fact you're reading a love story/self-help book about two amourously-aroused insects, it does get emotionally touching..."
2,Book as described.,"The book arrived on time and in the condition the seller stated. No issues with the shipping or the service. However, I did not get anything out of the book at all. It was a silly story about caterpillars that eventually led to nothing. I would not waste my time or money on this purchase. Most of the time I donate my books to the Red Cross or place them on the free book table at the library. I threw this one in the trash. Call me shallow, but I have read much better books on mindset and hope."
4,Very Inspirational,"I really enjoyed this book. It tackles, challenge, trust, confidence, forgiveness, and love. It makes you really think about the great things in life."
5,just in time,"Last night my 7 year old brought this book to our bed and wanted it as his bedtime story. A friend gave it to us years ago and it lay there unread. I lay in bed with him and my wife and read it aloud and at times couldn't even speak without my voice cracking....we have been living in Switzerland for 5 years now and are trying to muster up the courage to break away from an unfullfilling job and lifestyle and begin a homestead in Brazil. This book addressed everything that has been nagging at us and gave us tremendous courage and inspiration. Looking at the reviews it is amazing how inspirational it is for so many and for different reasons, those having lost a loved one, those going through a divorce and others. My wife and I looked at each other and were amazed!!! It is us she exclaimed! For we are Stripe and Yellow having met deciding to go down and now we are turned around and heading down. I absolutely loved this book and want to give it to everyone I know."
5,Loved it!!,A friend of mine lent me this book and loved it so much I bought it right away! Fantastic story with a great message about following one's own inner voice. I keep it close and re-read it every once in a while just to remind myself not to get caught up in that caterpillar-pillar!
4,Big Props for this one,"Wow, this little parable is a world changer! Especially for those who get caught in the rat race of just climbing, succeeding, bigger, better, etc. I read it through the lens of church and American spirituality...a flawed version of Christianity...and it really puts life back into focus."
4,Rare book read it,"No matter what your opinion is about World Zionist Organization from the 19th century, read this book. Considering that the book ""The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion"" is selling like crazy, this book written in 1921 counters all the claims. It is free, which is even better. Good read."
5,Inspiration to Personally Do Better,"The excerpts from Franklin's and others' own writings is invaluable in allowing the reader to truly get to know the man. I knew he had given a lot for our country, but I had no idea how much! I'm buying one for each of my children's families so they can share the book with our 12 grandchildren."
1,For children,"If you want to know the ""real"" Franklin, read his autobiography and/or the superb biography by Walter Isaacson. A FAR better view of the real Franklin than this book. I rather meet the true-to-life Franklin shown in the latter two works than the white-washed one presented in this book.- a Vietnam-era Vet with 12 years as a USAF officer."
4,The Real Ben Franklin,"I have read all of the latest and many earlier biographies of Benjamin Franklin. This work hits the mark on showing his human side, his intellectual rigor, and is also very good on his interactions with the other Founders. I found it more readable than other Franklin biographies. I recommend this book highly and believe it would also be a great text for our educators at the high school level or higher. Of course, History and its significance to people today is not really taught in high school much anymore. I wonder what people like old Ben would make of our glaring ignorance of our own history."
4,Enjoyed this book very much!,"I found this book to be enlightening, entertaining, educational and inspiring. The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars rather than a full 5 star rating is the lack of consistent chronological flow. Too many places in the book the authors seem to take rabbit trails, that while very interesting lead to a disjointed flow to the natural progression of the story. Other than that I was very pleased with their product. It was well researched and footnoted. I especially appreciate them letting Franklin “speak for himself” in as many areas as possible."
5,Great!,"A must read for all. You will surprise yourself, friends, and family about all that Ben Franklin did in his life."
2,Only For Fanatics,"Alright, 'Fanatica' is a decent enough track, 'Angst?' is mediocre, and the remixes are pointless and neither are as good as the original version. The cover art is quite kewl though. People who think this is EBM are diluded and have lived sheltered lives, but fans of Rammstein might enjoy this try-hard offering."
5,Jeannie10,"The detail in this dragon is amazing! I do themed trees for Christmas, and someone wanted a dragon tree. This Fire Clan Dragon will rest on a small platform on the tree top and make a stunning presentation as the topper. With the movable head and claws, I can change the dragon's look. I'm looking forward to this project very much."

1,Paid to return broken rice cooker,"First off - I hate posting reviews - especially bad ones. I have never done this before - but I had to this time. I paid $40 plus shipping for this rice cooker from Antonline (because the PRODUCT got great reviews). I used it once, and it didn't work, so I called Sanyo (which is what the seller said I had to do before contacting them for a refund). Sanyo said it was a faulty item and to send it back to the seller. The seller then made ME pay the shipping costs ($13.95 for a $40 item) to ship it back to them, and it will take up to a month for the return transaction. I found out later that another buyer had a similar problem with a lamp purchased from these folks. I would never have a buyer pay to return a broken item that I sold to them. It's just not good business...and they will never get mine again. Hope this helps someone else some day."
1,IT broken,"I have just use it for 4 month and it broken now, besides I did not know how to repaire it, I feel very angry about it"
4,Happy with it,"My wife and I like rice. We buy it 25 pounds at a time. Perhaps because we cook rice so often (at least 2-3 times per week), we've had terrible luck keeping a rice cooker running for more than a few years. They start getting flaky and then just die. This Sanyo is the 4th rice cooker we've purchased since 2000. This time, we decided to shop online and spend more money in the hopes of getting a product that would work better and last longer. So far, we've had this one about 2 years, and it seems to be in better shape than most of the others were at this point. It does a good job cooking the rice, although it's a bit slower than some of the other units we've had in the past. The top seals shut when the rice is cooking, which is interesting, but I'm not sure if it makes much difference in how it works. The carry handle is convenient, and the cooker fits nicely in my cabinet. My main gripe is that the measuring lines in the pot are hard to see, even in direct light."
1,disappointed,"bought this item because of the many favorable reviews but very disapponted, the rice is not cooked well and does not stay good the next day, in fact the rice is burned at the bottom, have used it only 2 or 3 times hoping it will work well but to no avail, will sell this at a garage sale"
2,This book is far too old,"This book was published in the early 1990s and is a collection of articles from Model Airplane News from the previous several years. As such, it's woefully out of date.If you're new to radio control aircraft, buy one of the many newer books on the market. Much, much, much has changed in the past 3-5 years, particularly related to electric motor flight, foam models (as opposed to balsa and ply), ready-to-fly (everything in one box--airplane, transmitter, onboard electronics, and only 30 minutes assembly time), newer stabilizing and control surfaces (winglets on sailplanes, for example), microelectronics, computer radios (transmitters), quantum leaps in battery technology (lithium polymer), etc.The field has changed. This book hasn't."
3,"Let's kill the rapists, and anyone else who looks like them.","This ""novel"" is a chronicle of the early life of ""Andrea,"" a woman from New Jersey who endures a life of sexual abuse and eventually becomes a radical feminist. Using a stream-of-consciousness first-person narrative, with long, repetitious sentences, Dworkin attempts to show us the shattered mind of a woman who has faced the worst assaults on her sense of self. In so doing, she denies us the presence of any other real characters, and ends up (intentionally) reducing the many abusive men in the novel to their violating body parts and destructive acts. In this sense, the novel itself is an act of retaliation, which Dworkin strongly endorses in the novel. Not for the faint of heart, this propagandistic book is an attempt to show why and how women must up the stakes in the battle of the sexes, and remember that it is nothing but a battle"
4,MJ Cole - Sincere,"MJ Cole's track SINCERE is a classic of garage, hands down. Even on the Radio Edit on this single, you can hear its soulfulness bleed through with every beat. Wookie takes the track slightly deeper and wobblier, but Jazzanova turn in another outstanding mix rooted into their unique blend of electro-jazz."
3,Nice but not what I expected,MJ remixes other peoples music beter than he does creating his own. Some super nice tracks here but not enough.
3,House with a Drum & Bass Beat,"I bought this in response to the overwhelming reviews I read everywhere about this, but upon listening to it, I was unimpressed to find that it is merely house with a drum & bass beat, nothing more earth-shattering than that. Lots of vocals. It's good creative work, but it is only essential if you're into house and drum & bass at the same time."
4,2 Steps into the Groove.,"On these American shores, MJ Cole is best known for his UK garage treatment of Mariah Carey's single ""Loverboy."" Armed with jittery beats and a jerky bassline, it helped introduce 2-step to the US. His album, ""Sincere,"" doesn't stray that far from what the average dance guru expects from a two-step release: nervous drumbeats, rubbery basslines with some vocals and rapping. But what separates this from the rest of the pack is the attention to melody and song structure. This is a two-step album with soul, and from the word ""go,"" the beat never relents. But Cole is no one trick pony, as he also incorporates mid-tempo r&b which saves ""Sincere"" from being one-dimensional. Some snobs may call two step ""so 2001,"" but this record is still noteworthy and solid enough to deserve your attention."
4,GOOD PRODUCT!,"Great light for a small bulb, easy to use and soo cheap! i really like it and fast shipping"
2,1 Year later...,"I've had this over a year and, to be honest, I rarely use it. I purchased this to illuminate my 17"" notebook keyboard and it just doesn't work like I thought it would. The light is sufficiently bright and the build quality is top-notch, but there are a couple of caveats that keep me from recommending it. First, the beam of light is far too focused. It's more of a flashlight than a lamp. It only illuminates about half of my keyboard which is fine in a pinch, but hardly usable for extended periods of time. Second, it's way too heavy; it sags and bends from it's own weight. It's inevitable that if you get it into a position where it stays put, it will be pointing too far up or down, or in your eyes. I leave this thing in the bottom of my laptop bag and pull it out every so often for various situations, but it's too frustrating to use on a regular basis."
2,"Not enough light, & too narrow a beam, for desktop use","I was hoping to use this product to illuminate my desktop keyboard, which I use at night. Unfortunately I can't get the beam to cover the entire keyboard, and even where it does cover it's not bright enough for me to read the keycaps.I know it's advertised for notebook, so it's my own fault - notebooks have smaller keyboard and also the low light trades off against low battery draw. So it might be ok in a notebook context (I have the luxury of a lighted keyboard on my MacBook so don't have that problem).Meanwhile I'm still looking for a good solution for my nighttime problem. Sigh."
4,works well,"It's a handy light to have in your backpack.Pros:Bright light, solid constructionCons:no on/off switch"
4,Handy & Cheap,"For the price, it's a good buy. I use it on my old 12 inch Ibook and it illuminates most of the keyboard. It may not be as useful for larger notebooks."
5,thumbs up,"this is a good game when you have nothing better to be doing. who cares if its short, its fun. with so many difficulty levels it doesn't get boring, just dont play it all the time... who doesn't want to chill out by rollerblading around and shooting stuff with lazors. exchange game music with real music and its all good. \m/"
2,Gets boring fast,"Graphics and sound are good, but gameplay is so dull. I actually enjoy mindless shoot-em-up action but this one is just mindless without being any fun. It's not a bad game, but it's not good either."
3,Cannon Spike,"It appears Capcom enjoys taking their characters and putting them in unusual settings, and this concept works better than similar attempts by other companies (anyone remember Midway's Sub-Zero platform crap?), but I'm sure they could have come up with something better than rocket-skates. Still, fans of action shooters will have some fun with this one."
1,Stay away from this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't be hooked by the fact that you can play as megaman or the other capcon fighters. The weapons of all the players are basicly the same. You shoot a bullent with your right hand, and you shoot a special large blast with your left hand. Thats all you can do!! Megaman does not have a large inventory of weapons like he does in his other games.The arenas are very small, and there are only about 8 stages. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SKILL INVOLVED. Based on how you select the difficulty level, the game will be either too easy, or impossible to beat.The only reason why people are giving this game a good rating is because they, or their friends, are trying to sell overpriced used copies."
5,T.M. Gray at her finest!,"Feast delivers the goods...and then some!! Very well written; Maine's maven of the Macabre engrosses the reader in each story, leaving you craving more as the final page is turned. If you haven't read this one, a massive 45 story collection, you're definitely missing out!"
5,A veritable smorgasbord of horror!,"TM Gray blazes a trail through the horror genre for others to follow. That said, her first novel--a collection of terrifying short stories--is not only riveting, on the edge of your seat reading, but essential for anyone who loves to be scared. ""Feast of Faust"" is by far one of the best compilations ever to come along in years. Gray is a master of suspense; I devoured each tale voraciously and couldn't wait to see what was next on the ""menu"". She is a brilliant writer, crafting her prose with a chilling surefootedness that holds the reader spellbound. ""Faust"" is a perfect launching point for a career that I for one cannot wait to follow. Do yourself a favor...pick up Gray's ""Feast of Faust"" and dine with this phenomenal Mistress of the Macabre!"
2,Flimsy,"The seam between the three holes and the pouches is to severe. If you actually want to put 4 disks in this product, it will fall over. It's okay if you put the insert into the top portion and the CD into the bottom."
3,pockets are a tight fit,"These sleeves do their job of hiding my DVDs. However, the pockets are a tight fit for the DVD jackets that we included in with the DVDs to help organize and identify the movies."
5,BEST! CD/DVD storage,"This is the best DC/DVD storage system I have found. After trying other formats, the binder with additional insert pages really did the job. And the binders look so handsome and orderly. Good riddance to the old CD tower!!!"
5,Best storage product for cds,THis system is the best for holding my backup copies of online purchases. Each binder holds a plenty of these inserts adn can be kept on a bookshelf for easy access.
3,Great binder bad insert,"I reallly like the binder but the inserts are a hassle to use. The disk slips into the insert easy enough but the top of the insert is not user friendly and you have to mess with it every time. You have to work at getting it to cover the top of the disk. If you dont do this and turn the binder upside down, disk fall out of the binder in mass. An oversized flap like Tantor uses would work much better."
5,This is amazing,"First, this CD is impressible-only two instruments but the music they play is incredible.The music in this CD-slow and fast-emotional.Amazing.And again...highly recommended!"
1,Not what you think!,This was not what it was portrayed to be on the web...it is a meta-analysis that is edited. It is not what I needed and it was very expensive.
4,2005 AFC CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS HOODED SWEATSHIRT,THIS ITEM WAS ORDERED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM FANS EDGE. THE COMPANY SHIPPED THE ITEM IN A TIMELY MANNER TO ARRIVE PRIOR TO CHRISTMAS USING PRIORITY SHIPPING. I GOT THE SWEATSHIRT FOR A VERY GOOD SALE PRICE. IT ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. IT WAS AS DESCRIBED ON THE WEB PAGE. QUALITY MATERIAL AND MEDIUM WEIGHT. I GAVE IT FOUR STARS INSTEAD OF FIVE BECAUSE IT SEEMED THAT FOR A MENS LARGE IT SEEMED TO RUN A BIT SMALL. I ADVISE YOU TO ORDER ONE SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD. KEN
3,"Great for locating falls, not so good on descriptions","This guide is focused on taking photos of waterfalls. It was fine for locating where the waterfalls were, but fails in regards to trail/access descriptions. I went to a waterfall with an ""easy"" hike, which was posted as challenging on site. I travel with a disabled family member, so I expected an ""easy"" hike to be more manageable. I managed to see the falls, but my family members waited for me in the car. :-( I ended up buying a different waterfall guide while I was on vacation and giving this one away."
2,Spider-man Child Bike Helmet and Pads,"The sizing on this item is off. It fit my granddaughter, who is 2yrs, 9 mo. but didn't even come close to the intended 4 yr, 8 month old boy.....way small. I didn't see a process for purchasing according to head diameter, so the item was useless for it's intended recipient."
1,screen protect,this product does not work all it does is gather dirt and make the screen bubble it won't even stay on not worth the money or time spend trying to put it on the best protection is the wrist strap this way it can't fall
4,"Good but not great, wished they were more durable","These are great because unlike the touch screen surface of the DS you can replace the protector if they get scratched up. The problem I'm having after about 2 weeks of considerate DS usage with the filters is the scratches in the touch screen protector are more noticeable than any scratches I've accumulated on my DS touch screen over the last year. (I do realize that any existing DS touch screen scratches would not be eliminated by the filter and I've taken that into consideration.) I'm not dissatisfied with the filters but right now I feel like I'll end up spending about the same amount on filters as I would on a new DS every one and a half years if I were to keep replacing them as they wear out. I'll keep buying screen protectors but I'm not loyal to this brand by any means, that said user comments about competing products are much less favorable than this product."
5,Review of Air Bike by Weslo,We are very pleased with the Air Bike we purchased. It is helping us get in shape and is just what we were hoping for. The service was exceptional. We received the Bike within 2 days and were pleasantly surprised.
5,Love them!,"Ordering clothes online is always a guess as to how they will fit. Since most stretchy exercise pants I've tried seem to run small I ordered these a size bigger than I normally wear. When they arrived I tried them on they were perfect, not too tight but form fitting. I ordered these specifically for Zumba but have been wearing them whenever I want to be comfortable. I work in a very casual 3-person office and I've even worn them to work. So far they have held up very well to multiple machine washings and dryings. I think I'm going to order some more just to have on hand in case they get discontinued."
5,Great jewelry,Good durable materials that don't irritate my skin like most metals :) I have been wearing these for over 6 months and have noticed no degrading of the metal.
5,Life from a different angle,"The Mikwright books like this take a photo from a normal aspect of life and add their own their own commentary to it from a point of view that is just a little bit different from the rest of the world. It makes for some great fun and very entertaining reading. It's perfect for the quick occasional mindless break. An excellent bathroom book - though when you hear your guests laughing out load when they are in there, you will probably wonder what else they might really be up to."
1,Does not fit. Is this an AC Delco part?????? Says China,"This regulator came with a AC Delco 1995 copyright date sticker, had the 19120846 part number. This is interesting since the part number is for 2000 and later vehicles according to GM.Also, the motor on new unit says ""China"" and the motor is upside down on the forward end of the regulator. Also, there is no part number on the regulator frame, the original GM regulator has a part number on one side of the frame. Unit does not fit 2000 Yukon front drivers door due to motor being mounted upside down as compared with the original. It appears as this is a Chinese made part sold as a OEM AC Delco.Not sure what I received....................."
5,Delivers what it promises,"I have not bought a new package of AA batteries since I got this, and we normally go through them like water. I have successfully extended the life of at least eight sets of batteries.I checked with my meter--it brings batteries as low as 1.4 VDC back up to 1.51 or 1.52 VDC (new, they tend to be at 1.54 VDC). I have several sets of batteries I've recharged at least three times and they are still working fine.The key is following the directions: do not wait until the batteries are dead. Emerson states it will not work with completely dead batteries."
2,Not user friendly,I am not even sure if this recharger works properly. I have tried to recharge several sets (of different) C cell batteries and I have yet to ever get the green light indicating that the recharge is complete--even after waiting a week with one set. This unit did appear to recharge some C cell Ni-Cad batteries but did not appear to recharge some C cell rechargeable alkalines or standard alkalines--even though it claims to be able to recharge them. I cannot recommend it.
5,A book I'll always remember...,I read this book when I was about thirteen on the recommendation of my English teacher. I'm now 21 and still remember it and have recently ordered it from my library and re-read it. It's as good as I remember and keeps you hanging untill the last minute!! Read it!
3,my opinion on this book,i read intersteller pig by william sleator beacuse my english teacher made the whole grade read it. it get rocky towards the middle but the ending i liked. the ending is jammed packed with fighting which i like. if u like sci-fi u with like this book.
2,Interstellar Pig,"In this book Interstellar Pig by William Stealor it is about a boy named Barney who has to spend the summer on the boring beach. When he learns the thrilling history of his house and weird things start to happen. He also learns of his new neighbors. Their names are Zena, Manny, and Joe and they are weirdly interested in Barney's house. He decides to join them in their favorite board game Interstellar Pig which rival aliens stop at nothing to destroy every other creature in the universe. Barney starts to become suspicious.This book has a lot of science fiction and fantasy ideas in it. I didn't like it because I don't like science fiction and it wasn't on my top list. Any person or kid who is interested in these types of books would love this book because of its unique story that unfolds with every chapter. In conclusion Interstellar Pig is a good book and I think a lot of people would like it."
2,This Pig Stinks,"This book isn't bad. But it isn't good. There are waaaaaayyyy better books out there. The only somewhat good parts of the book is when the game is actually being played--the rest is boring filler--and these moments are way too few. Then things keep getting weirder and weirder, and less and less believable. The ending is poor. This book may be appropriate for someone under eleven years-old.I enjoy games, and this game was indeed interesting, however, i think Sleator should have designed the game, not the book. I actually found the moments when the game was just a game better than the preposterous final part of the book.I hated all the characters--didn't love to hate them, just hated them--they really were quite dull and annoying. Barney's 'insanity' was really unconvincing. All attempts at suspense and thrill were void to me.Thank you, Sleator, now I know what kind of book I don't want to end up writing."
1,OK,"This book is a story of one child's encounter with the new next door neighbors. What begins as an ordinary game turns suspicious. Are they robbers, are thy con-men? What are they up to? This book is for sci-fi buffs only! If you don't like sci-fi you probably wouldn't like this book. I for one did not like this book. It is a difficult book to read. You have to be able to `connect the dots' to understand this book. I would recommend this book for sci-fi buffs, but others may not enjoy it as much."
3,interstellar pig,"not thrilled with the names of certain planets in this book, how do you pronounce words like mbridble?? lets use words that are easy for kids to read. when in your life are you going to need that word?"
5,YO! THIS BOOK ROCKS SO HARD!,"This book was one of the best weird books I ever read! If you're into the odd, or you are odd, or whatever, you should read it. It rocks so hard!"
3,Sci-Fi for the pre-teen,"Found a copy of this going through old books at my parents house. I probably picked this up when I was about eleven and was into role playing games. Reminiscent of the film The Last Starfighter, this slender novel is about how a teen boy on summer vacation has the world of his imagination come to his door step. A reader of sci-fi, our young hero gets mixed into a world of treasure hunting, space aliens and possibly the future of the planet. The narrative is not complicated and the style very readable. Certainly not essential reading and for the adult looking for story about a person who's imagination and imaginative worlds play a critical part of one's life (minus the aliens) I would recommend Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc."
5,"""There is no heat in interstellar space...""",Sixteen year old Barney is expecting a boring summer at the beach until he finds out about a tragedy that occurred in the same cottage he is staying in. The arrival of three mysterious neighbors who have an obsession with Barney's cottage and are addicted to a strange board game they call Interstellar Pig add unexpected excitement to his summer. Barney soon understands the game's concept and becomes addicted. But Barney notices that they seem interested in a nearby island; and what he discovers there makes him wonder if his neighbors are looking for a trinket mentioned in a one-hundred year old document about the tragedy...Sleator vividly describes the story's events; his writing is filled with rich details which delight the reader's imagination.
3,"Great, but only for hard core Tolkien fans","I bought yhis DVD because I own just about everything that is commercialy available on DVD. I will admit while it was very insightfull I was a bit dissapointed. It is not so much of a story of the Lord of the Rings but a very in depth biography of Tolkien with quite a bit of time centered around his years as a Professor.Buy this if you are a die hard tolkien fan, avoid it if not as it may bore you."
3,Hated the ending!,"After NINE books, I was looking forward to some answers to a few questions, one huge one of which Hobb leaves hanging, making me wonder if she's coming back to the series at a later date. I hope so, since the ending left me not only cold, but resentful.The book is well paced and well written, and as with all Hobb books, I have teared up unexpectedly and then laughed a few pages later. The character of Thick is so gently drawn, and the Fool is one of my favorite fantasy characters, reminding me in a way of Agent Pendergast from Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's books.But Fitz, poor Fitz, ""poor me"" Fitz- he was never meant for a storybook ending. Life isn't that way, and I really, truly feel like Hobb copped out. I was left holding the book, looking for a postscript, SOMETHING, to remove my utter distaste and disbelief at what I had just read.It's a magnificent series of books, all nine, but to me, the ending was a revolting letdown!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Skillmaster and the Dragon.The quest for the dragon involves some perilous and arduous sea travel and other journeying, which many of this party are not particularly sorted too. Fitz, as Skillmaster has a few problems on his hands, least of which is the actual reason behind this trip to start with, and what the Fool is really up to.Another fine book, but I think a few people are going to be annoyed by the Fitz/Fool resolution, if you can call it that."
5,awesome book!,"this book was my favorite of all these books (farseer, mad ship, and tawny man)! maybe because for once, good things happened to fitz. I still cried during parts, but I was very happy with how hobb tied things together that I had never even considered before. I sincerely hope that she will continue some of the characters into later novels, as the fool has always been my favorite character and I would love to know more about him."
5,Another classic Robin Hobb novel,"To keep it simple, this book was fantastic!!! If you love well written fantasy fiction, Robin Hobb is without a doubt worth your time. One warning!!! Start back with Assassin's Apprentice."
3,"Not bad, but could have been much better","I loved the original Farseer Trilogy - pithy, intense fantasy. The tormented, loyal, talented Fitz was a great character. The trilogy's end too was reminiscent of life in all its bittersweet disappointment.But Fool's Fate has not, I feel, lived up to the promise of what the author is capable of. The narrative was predictable and almost tedious as the author attempted to tie up the loose ends of ALL her trilogies set in this world.But worst of all was the grand finale. I agree with other reviewers who were truly disappointed at how the Tawny Man trilogy ended. Perhaps the best way to characterize it would be: scarred and powerful hero abandons exciting, meaningful life for bucolic pleasures of suburbia.Not being a fan of the suburban lifestyle, it just didn't work for me."
3,OK,"To be honest I really enjoy Robin Hobb. I actually own both printed, kindle and audio additions of most of her books. This last book was good and I did enjoy it until the end. The end was rushed and it seemed to want to end the series in the simplest, quickest way possible. At one point you have Fitz taking command as a king and this role was never followed through. He has Molly back and their life is complete no more dealing with the royal family. The way she developed this series that ending seems unlikely. It came off as a ""fairy tale"" ending. I also did not like the incompleteness of the ending with the Fool that was truly unsatisfying. I don't regret reading the book but my expectations did not match the writers vision."
5,Beautiful,"I couldn't put this book down. It's beauty is overwhelming, and it never leaves you feeling cheated. I won't say anymore, as I don't want to ruin anything. You would be remiss not to read this book."
2,A Lousy End to a Great Series,"I was excited to hear that Robin Hobb was bringing Fitz and the whole troop back for another series and the first two books did not fail to entertain.However the final book really left me disappointed. The whole thing with the prince and the dragon to win the heart of this tribal girl really fell flat. They had zero chemistry when together and the Out Islanders really were not very interesting as a people.Plus I don't think Fitz got the ending he deserves. I won't say one way or the other what that means, but suffice to say, he is not given his just rewards here.It would have been better to toss the whole idea for the trilogy than let it end this way."
2,Unsatisfying ending and the whole trilogy is a big let down,"Overall impression is one big disappointment.The whole trilogy left a feeling of the bloated fourth volume of The Farseer Trilogy where all loose ends are being tied up. Although, it is done very ungratefully.!!!WARNING!!! SPOILERSFitz & Molly reunion plus 7 kids bonus is very artificial and out of context. 16 Years is not 16 months. They would be totally different people regardless of what happened within this period. Let alone vast life experience that affected both of them.Fool...my personal disappointment here. I hoped that Fitz is going to realise that Fool is a woman and They Live Happily Ever After with a sense of wonder about each other and respect and exciting life...On top of this the usual numerous repetitions of what happened only a hundred pages before.The Tawny Man trilogy is a big let down.Hobb was at the top 5 of my favourite writers since 2002, it is very sad to lose her now."
4,Ms. Hobb Makes a Foolish Twist,"Should Ms. Hobb go back to work and rewrite the story to replace this dreary ending? After painstakingly tying all loose knots together, we are left unresolved regarding Fitz and the Fool. A sad ending to a really great series."
5,great book - made me reconsider my 4 knife policy,"It made me - a very macho commie stabber - all sissified. I like the character of the fool and of the assasin. This book brought the trilogy to an awesome conculsion. You know how people say endings are always stupid because they are too simple or too complex or unrealistic? Well, this book made me recosider that. I had closure.I wish the author had more courage to write about what actual fools and assasins do, and not to sissify the book with feelings. But I guess feelings is good once in a while. I'll need to take a bath though."
5,"Hobb has, yet again, brought a masterful story","The intricate weavings of characters and plot that Robin Hobb is known for, was delivered again in the last book of the Tawny Man Trilogy. A great book to end a great trilogy."
5,best fantasy series I've read in years,"I loved the Assassin series and the Fool series! I bought them on my kindle so that I was able to finish one and immediately continue on with the story. I was sad that it finally ended, but it was a good ending (even though I cried my eyes out!). This is a great story and I really recommend it to anyone looking for a new series to start."
3,Weak end for a great series...,"I liked ""Farseer"" trilogy, I absolutely LOVED ""Liveship Traders"", but ""Tawny Man"" left a taste of something written just to finish the series... Fitz is the main hero only because he's Catalyst to the White Prophet, which through middle tree books is a woman...?!The plot is inconsistent, with weak links, unfinished story lines in middle and too much finished story lines at the end (all those in stile ""happily ever after""). I didn't want Fitz dead but there could be different hero... Or may be there's another trilogy waiting?I do not wish to finish with a bad taste - writing itself is as always brilliant, but as I said, other factors don't let this book rise to flight like Icefire dragon!"
5,Love this book!,"The book is a little worn, and rough around the edges but that's to be expected. It gives it more history, more personality in my opinion, and over all is a great buy. The pages are all intact, without any tears or burns. It does show its age and much more. This is a great buy for anyone who is looking for a good read."
5,My Review,"Short and to the point: An excellent read. Buy this Book. Heck, buy the entire series. Six books in all for Fitz Farseer. I dont normally like first person novels but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these. Hobb is a masterful storyteller who weaves a beautiful tale of a bastard prince and the Six Duchies. Please just read these books."
2,Hobb again provides a disappointing ending,"I regret the time I invested in all 9 of the books in this series, as the ending was an incredible disappointment. Just like in Assassin's Quest, major events are quickly summarized, many of the character decisions are random & completely different from what was foreshadowed, and most disappointingly, emotionally important characters are tossed aside to avoid a complicated ending.I would not recommend these to a friend. I won't deny that Hobb does a wonderful job making us invest in these characters, but that's why it is so disappointing to see the way they actually go."
3,Dish! Nudity! and more Dish!,"Some people may find this movie to be a gay version of a summer flick. It does the job quite well despite the use of clicheed stereotypes and language which is often, well, fluff. The acting is lighthearted and often good especially by John Glover and John Benjamin Hickey. The nudity is refreshingly real and in good taste [a tad like a men's locker room]. The story line is simple: 8 gay men meet for a few weekends during the summer at a beautiful Victorian home in upstate New York. They leave behind their swimming trunks but not their frustrations with relationships, their jobs, each other, a world which doesn't understand gay men and ultimately, AIDS."
5,very great movie,This movie is very good but pretty sad in the end tho. I couldnt say for words about this movie so I figured I would give this 5 stars!!
3,"Not as good as I'd hoped, but it did have its moments.","I expected more from this movie than I actually got out of it, but it was entertaining at times. It seemed that a couple of the characters were too stereotypically gay (especially the part played by Jason Alexander), but overall seemed to be an accurate portrayal of eight gay friends and how they related to one another. If you want to get through this life without catching a glimps of Alexander's bottom...close your eyes during the volleyball scene!"
3,Okay adaptation of Broadway Hit,"This film adaptation of McNally's play loses much of the poignancy it had in its Broadway incarnation. It also dispenses with most of the narration, which is a shame as much of the ""framing"" information about the characters was contained in the play's narration. The performances are adequate, if uninspired. Another case where casting a film with the stage actors was perhaps not the best idea. A similar theme was explored in the dated but still dynamic ""The Boys In The Band"". And a more exciting, offbeat variation on the same idea can be found in the British film ""Boyfriends"". But when, oh when, will ""gay cinema"" move beyond these cliche-ridden characters and explore the vast range of gay life experiences?"
5,it was a wonderful movie and I liked it alot.,well I thought that it was very well done and all of the people in it did a nice job of being like real gay people and if I did not know any different I would have thought that they was all gay from their acting. from one gay man out in the world I would not change a thing. I would like to own it!!!
1,Cliches from the word go,"This film adaptation of Terrance McNally's play is full of stereotypes and cliches. Following the gatherings of 8 gay men and their vacations together at a lake house, the film claims to examine how they struggle with such issues as AIDS and loss. Instead we get Buzz, a stereotyped gay man with a limp wrist and a fixation for show tunes - his camp act clearly aimed at getting laughs from a straight audience.Then there is a completely insipid sub plot about two twins that is so contrived it is painful to watch. Such a pity when gay themed movies end up perpetuating gay stereotypes and cliches."
1,Offensive,"I was unable to decide if I was more offended by the stereotypical (I would say homophobic except that it is written by a gay man)humor or by the sentimental and manipulating drama in this film. There was not a single character who was endearing; there was not a single relationship in the group that seemed to express love; and there were very few conversations that were interesting or plausibly motivated. Jason Alexander played his part as if he were doing a politically incorrect skit for Fox TV. And the story about the twin brothers with completely different personalities was stupid, a symbolic ploy that may have won praise if written by a junior high school student.The only positive element of this film is that it made me appreciate the fast forward button on the remote."
3,Another World,"""Trona"" is a microcosm of it's namesake ... a world of contradictions.It is hilarious ... and depressing. Beautiful ... and squalid. Boring ... and fascinating. All at the same time.It's a movie about a lonely man frustrated with his life ... a man who wants to escape. And escape he does, inexplicably finding himself transported to the middle of the blind desert in his business suit.Hilarious circumstances strip him of almost all of his clothes, leaving him in his tidy whities, dark socks and dress shoes, a visual reminder that he is leaving it all behind.Along the way, the viewer is given insight to a world few get to see. A world where the drink of choice is Robitussin on the rocks. And one where peeing in the corner of a hotel room makes more sense than using the toilet.The dialog is spare. The music ethereal. The symbolism rampant.If you're curious and patient, it's worth a look."
4,Truly an American classic!,"Dave Fenster's poetic cinematography and insightful direction blend seamlesslywith David Nordstrom's relaxed, yet self-assured iconic performance.Mr. Lynch as well, is in top form."
2,Soft and thick but PILL like crazy,"The first few times I wore these, I was incredibly happy. Very soft, thick, stretchy, holds their shape, and very opaque. BUT they pill like crazy and the color also fades after several months. I like the Capezio leggings better."
1,Polar Bears and Penguins???,"Barrons usually produces very nice and educational books, however in thia book, it appears that polar bear and penguin live together...let's not confuse the children, since everyone knows that not only do they not live together, they don't live in the same hemisphere!!! You could have polar bear travel down to Anarctica to meet his friend, other wise they would never meet at all!!!"
3,CD???,Though the book is very well writen it could use a CD with the songs and licks for those of us who may never have heard them before.
1,Not so hot licks,"The licks aren't so hot. This book doesn't give you any understanding of the scales underlying the licks. Also, it focuses almost exclusively on the open fingering and a limited set of chords which doesn't really help you if you, like, play a different song. So if you think you can memorize your way into bluegrass, this is the book for you."
3,"Important to the story, but not as much fun","If you are reading the entire Argeneau series, you can't miss this one, because it provides some important back story to some of the later novels. Unfortunately, I found it to be the slowest paced of the entire series. I rated it a 3 because it's important to read it, or some of the later stories will not make any sense, but you may have to hold your eyes open if you're reading it before bed."
4,An easy book to read and fall in love with,From the first book of the Argeneau series I was hooked. Which I read on the chance that I would like it. I love them now.
4,Interesting contemporary vampire novel,"This is my first novel by Lynsay Sands. I bought the unabridged version of Tall, Dark & Hungry read by Jeffrey Cummings and I thought that it was pretty good. I agree with some reviewers that it was probably a bit boring if you read the novel, but I listened to it and I believe that it made a difference. There was a lot of wit, mishaps and humor which really came through as Jeffrey cummings told the story. I think that if I had read the novel that it would have been slow moving for a while before it picks up and I might have just put the book down and not returned to it. There are some good sex scenes and I really liked Bastien's total sappy devotion and love for Terri. They make an interesting as well as funny couple. As suggested, I will try another book in the Argeneau series to see if it is better."
5,"Tall, Dark and Hungry Argeneau vampires book 4","Proving for sure that one doesn't need vampire killers or killer vampires to make a good vampire book Lynsay Sands follow up the events of Single White Vampire in a way that will be a hit for anyone who was ever a fan of The Munsters or The Addams Family. The Argeneau is your typical family next door. They're just a vampire of vampires.Coming to New York Terri has flown from England for her cousin's wedding where she stays with Bastien and wacky vampire actor Vincent in the penthouse. The wedding to be is like sometime you'd expect from 1950s comedy movie with Doris Day or Lucille Ball as events unfold just as busted pipes wreaking some of the wedding decorations, the chef getting food posioning and having to be replace and Terri and Bastien falling in love. Even a vamp whose good talking in a business meeting isn't always good with talking to the woman he loves and need more help than most to win over the woman of his dreams."
5,Very good book!,"If you like this series I think you will love this book. It is very good and a great love story with the vampire twist. So far this is one of my favorite, but I am catching up slowly on the complete series to catch up."
5,Argeneau Novels,"I was hook after reading the first book in this series. I have to pace myself so that enjoy the experience. Love the fact that most of the books have combination of mystery, light hearted spin."
4,sexy,Another sexy vampire book from Ms Sands. I really love this series. A great read to curl up with I can't wait for the next book.
2,Not good,"I know that this author has been compared to Charlaine Harris. In my mind, there is no comparison. I thought this was stupid dribble."
4,Murphy's Law enters here...,"Take a grumpy Vampire and a bridesmaid who has no clue what her best friend has gotten into, plus a wedding that puts even Murphy's Law to the test and you have laughs around almost every corner.Between trying to hide his being a vampire from Terri, his nephew showing up to stay for a while and tasting the housekeeper, and the assistant to the bride breaks his leg. This couple has a lot to do and a short time to get it done, the caterer goes out of business, the flowers get a disease and that's just the beginning. Don't miss this 3rd installment of a vampire series that isn't dark and moody. These guys don't go looking for dinner, it's delivered from a special blood bank."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring",Sorry got half way through and couldn't read anymore so I skipped to the end. The main characters were extremely boring. The only character with any depth and humor was Vincent!
1,So very dull.,"I wasted an entire evening reading this book, time I'll never get back. There's no chemistry between Bastien and and Terri and way too much internal monologue. Not the quality I've come to expect from Ms. Sands."
5,One of the best of the series!,Finally a happily ever after for Bastien. This story is great fun for followers of the series since Bastien finally gets his happily ever after and with a women who is a perfect compliment. To read their fun antics and see his world shaken up for the first time is a real joy!
3,Long in the tooth and lacks bite.,"When Terri Simpson comes to New York, she is expecting to spend two weeks with her cousin Kate, helping with any of the last few details of Kate's wedding. But an accident forces Kate and her fiance Luc out of town and Terri is stuck with Bastien, Luc's brother. The attraction between the two is immediate and intense...and that is about it. Lynsay Sands fails to give Bastien and Terri anything really interesting to do outside of handling a few wedding snafus. Most of the entertainment comes from actor Vincent and accident prone Chris. Just enough humor and spice to keep the reader from getting too bored, but a stronger plot would have been nice."
4,Entertaining Little Romp,"I stumbled across this in the bookstore and picked it up on a whim. I was not disappointed. I haven't read the previous books in this series, and while I had a few questions on some of the back story, it didn't diminish my enjoyment one bit.If you like your vampires dark and serious, this is not the book for you. If you can laugh at ""creatures of the night"" ala Angel, Spike and Harmony Kendall...okay, more Harmony than the boys...then I would definitely recommend it.This is romantic comedy, a little light in the plot department sometimes (the author seemed to be setting up something that ended up being one too many coincidences), but the dialogue is charming, the pacing good, and I felt satisfied with the ending. As a bonus, there's some good give and take between the heroine that is not as all mean-spirited as some books I've read recently.I enjoyed it enough to look for the earlier books and I hope Ms. Sands will be giving us Lucien's story soon."
3,Kids Medium is more like an Adult's Medium,I purchased these gardening gloves for my 4- year old boy and they fit me! I wish I had known they were so large. We will just have to wait for him to grow in to them.
1,"whatever you do, do not order from IN THE MOOD INTIMATES","This seller, ""In the Mood Intimates,"" is highly disreputable. I bought a matched bra and panty set, same color, as a gift. The bra was at a great sale price, the matching panty was at full price. The total, in excess of $100, qualified me for a $10 discount and free shipping.Twelve (12) days after receiving my credit card remittance, they shipped the panty only to me, with no explanation as to the missing bra. I left eleven (11) detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates over the next three days, with no response. Finally, another nine (9) days later, I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock, and refusing to accept a return of the panty (even though its packaging is unopened) owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile, they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $10 discount.These people are dishonest. Stay away from them."
2,Disapponted on Quickbooks 2006 for Dummies,"I was very disappointed with QuickBooks 2006 for Dummies because it did not deal with the issues of ""when"" and ""why"" one should use certain capabilites of QB. One can know all about how to manipulate the menus but not know when or why to do it. This is a very shallow product and I seriously thought about requesting a refund."
2,QuickBooks 2006 for Dummies,I thought the section on setting up a chart of accounts was very limited and superficial and the ability to print out your chart of accounts was most confusing. I use quickbooks on line and setting up my accounts using QuickBooks for Dummies was not much help.
1,Disappointed,"I agree with everything Keltic Kat said. I've never written a book review before, but this book annoyed me so much that I felt compelled. Maybe it's helpful for those who have no accounting knowledge. Personally, I thought it would be much more informative; as I'm reading it, I'm getting frustrated with the ""you don't need to know that"" crap. I bought the book because I DID want to know that crap. Ugh."
3,Good Ole' Dummies,"I love the Dummies series of books, they always do a good job of laying things out for the non-expert (which is why most of us buy them right?)This book is no exception, it does a very good job of getting you into and using QuickBooks. I doubt the book will make you an expert but if you need to get started right away, maybe you have a job interview on Monday for example, then this book is the way to go."
2,OK book,Did not have all dogmas in this book. I was looking for every defoned dogma and this book only had some
3,OK,"Too much religious stuff.This album fails to convey the quality of solitude that's essential for meditation.Jayashree's fantastic voice is endowed with a mysterious depth, again evident in this album."
4,¡Qué buen libro de chistes !,"...hay para todos los gustos, aunque definitivamente, SON CHISTES PARA ADULTOS, NO PARA NIÑOS...Pero hasta duele la mandíbula de tanto reirse ... Lea unos cuantos y no se arrepentirá...!En serio...los histes son muy buenos !"
2,"Item was not in ""BRAND NEW"" condition","This product looks sturdy. HOWEVER...IT IS NOT IN ""NEW"" CONDITION. Mine came in used condition. There were scratches in the top where the bed posts sit. Sizeable chunks and shavings of plastic were hanging off or have already fallen off. I do not like how this has been advertised as ""BRAND NEW"" and it clearly is not."
1,Broke within a week.,"I was a little skeptical and I should've went with my gut NOT to buy them. They broke within a week and there was NO love making going on or anything. Just regular bed use and a waste of money! The product costs as much as it would cost you to ship them back for a return, so it's no use, just lost money!"
3,Good for little ones,"The large pictures and touchy feely parts are perfect for the youngest toddlers. Once they get a bit older, there is not much on the pages to hold their attention for very long."
5,Perfect for the little ones,I love the simple language on each page. It is perfect for reading to the little guys who don't usually sit still for long. The illustrations are adorable and the touch-n-feel parts fit perfectly. One of our favorite books!
5,Fun Book,My daughter received this book as a Christmas gift when she was 8 months old. She loved it and it quickly became her favorite book. 7 months later and at 15 months old she still enjoys this book. She even reads the story to mommy. Great introduction to textures and the words associated with these textures. What a wonderful and fun way to encourage early literacy and language skills. This book is a wonderful first book and easily is enjoyed past baby's first year.
4,A great book for babies!,"My daughter is almost 8 months old and she loves books that have textures for her to touch. We own several other regular board books by Sandra Boynton and she loves all of them as well. I do wish that she had made this book longer, though, and that's the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's still a very nice book for babies to explore textures with."
3,Cute but expensive,"Sandra Boynton is a wonderful children's author, I have loved her since I was a child. However, there are very few pages (about 8) in this book and only one animal/texture on each page, and the flaps on the last two pages are hard to open. It is an expensive book for what you get. The textures are nice (especially the incredibly soft page) but there are books out there that are just as nice with more pages or more animals."
4,Short but sweet,"My 1 year old loves this book. My only wish is that was longer. There are very few pages, but they are classic Boynton."
4,Another hit,My 1 year old loves this book. She not only likes the big animal pictures; she likes the big words as well.
3,It's a good first touchy-feely book,"It's a little large, so it's great for lapsitters; there isn't too much in the way of vocabulary to muck things up; and the textures are varied.But it's the sort of book that babies and toddlers will tire of quickly, and yes, the two flaps on the back *will* get torn off, so it has to be a supervised book.For more long-term use, I'd suggest the ""That's Not My..."" series."
3,Fun touch and feel book,Fun touch and feel book for young minds and tiny hands. Only thing that is missing is a few more words.
3,Limited enjoyment,"This book was all the rage when we first got it for my daughter (at about 6 months). She hadn't yet learned animal names and mainly loved to touch the textures. Now (at 18 months) she says the animal names, but doesn't really bother to touch or feel the book. It's also sparse on words and pages, so it's enjoyment is now limited. We'll probably ""put it away"" for our future kiddos."
4,NG Prehistoric Predators,"In general, a very good presentation of subject matter, although some time should have been spent on the evolution of each species, instead of the repetition of the same animated graphics, which are quite good compared to previous prehistoric animal representations. In my opinion, a more appropriate title might have been 'Prehistoric Mammal Carniovores' as 'Predators' is to broad for subject matter addressed."
3,It's o.k. but could be better,I thought this movie was very informative but doesn't keep your attention. I think this documentary could have been made more interesting.
3,rather sickening,"Which seems to be the norm for a lot of documentaries on this subject lately. Granted, not a particularly cheerful subject but the same slaugher scenes over and over get old,"
3,Strangely lifeless,"I have read and enjoyed By Arrangement, but By Design falls somewhat short. It reads like a totally politically correct story, quite predictable and all the characters are strangely lifeless and wooden, never feel quite real but instead like generic sensitive characters."
5,Hot Romance!,Madeline Hunter is currently one of my favorite authors. She brings the reader to a different place and time. This story touched my heart. This is simply a wonderful love story. Enjoy!
3,Least Favorite by this Author,"As I say in all my Madeline Hunter reviews, this was well-written novel. Ms. Hunter is, technically speaking, an excellent writer. I don't always like her character development. In this novel, I really dislike her heroine. She was both immature and ungrateful. I could see no reason for the hero to fall in love with her. Her behavious ruined the story for me. I am not able to recommend this book."
3,By Design,"It is really a 3.5 stars. It is not that the book was bad, I just had trouble getting into the story. It seemed kind of boring to me. I didn't really get into the book until the last quarter of the book. Then it was more like By Possession where it has heart breaking because they could not be together. They were great characters and the book was good, it may have been just the mood I was in while reading it, but wish the first part of the book had been more interesting."
5,Captivating for it's original plot and characters,"By Design will be enjoyed so much more if you have read By Possession first. MH is a masterful storyteller and By Design is a poignant story, often sad due to the struggles of the time period but beautifully touching and heartwarming. MH descriptions of the time and place where Joan and Rhys find each other is mesmerizing at times. MH writes with an intelligence and warmth of characters that is true escapism.(edit)"
5,"""The Best""","This author, this book ranks at the top of all the hundreds of self-help books I have read. In this world of ""fix me now"", ""The Power of Belief"" brings us back to the reality that this is a ""do it yourself trip"" and gives us the tools to do the trip in a most positive way."
5,The way shoes should be,Stylish and comfy... What more could you ask for? My husband was very pleased.
1,give the director the hard eight,"this movie is awful. Anyone who wants any action or good gambling scenes is in for a surprise when they realize how horrid, and slow-moving this movie is. The actors show no intensity and do an overall terrible job. I would rate it 0 stars if that was an option."
4,Great cast!,"Very well acted with an unusual but very interesting story line. Some of the characters' actions seemed very odd (especially Paltrow's) but then a fair amount of human behavior in the real world is as well so ""no harm, no foul"". For a while it looked like they were going to ruin the film with a very out of character response to Jackson's play but that landmine is avoided. The twist at the end along with how everything finally resolves satisfyingly caps a very unusual story. A good watch!"
4,A Winning Cast And Story,"If you're a fan of this genre, you won't be dissapointed in this Noir effort. The casting and plot are top notch, and the performances and aethetic of the film are primo. You have a hard time finding a character to root for in the film, but on its own terms this is a great movie on a rainy night. TJR"
3,A MINIMALIST INDEPENDENT MOVIE.,"The first thing that you can notice when you see ""Hard Eight / Sydney"", is its great cast: the movie has talented actors like Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, Samuel L. Jackson and the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow. And the director is the critically acclaimed Paul Thomas Anderson.However, ""Hard Eight"" is not his best movie, and even though it's very interesting, the plot is not very complex, and this movie gives the impression that could have been a better movie. The characters are original, but after a while the movie offers little to get excited about.Although if you are fan of PTA's work, you definitely should see ""Hard Eight"", but if you have never seen a movie directed by PTA, start with ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" or ""Punch-Drunk Love"". ""Hard Eight"" is a good movie but nothing else."
3,Enjoyable but sometimes aggravating.,"I'm not a fan of the director-- I didn't know he was the same director of ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights""-- though I enjoy his work. I'm not a film major. I'm just your average chick who rents movies on the weekends. And I liked ""Hard Eight,"" but mostly because I truly enjoyed the underacting of Philip Baker Hall. While everyone's acting was superb, the characters played by Gwyneth Paltrow and John C. Reilly are so freaking DUMB I had a hard time sitting through some scenes.The plot ""twist"" that everyone is waiting for never truly pans out, either. If you'r elooking for a quiet, gloomy sort of movie, this one's for you."
3,Average,"A silly story of a gambler that picks up an out of luck person supposably at random and helps him out. These two characters have some adventures. I don't think the story made that much sense. Nor did it keep me particularly interested.The acting was fair, nothing excited me in the filming."
1,Oh My God! I can't believe I wasted time watching this..,"..complete muck! It's almost as bad as ""south of heaven, west of hell"""
2,Hard To Stay Awake...,"Don't get me wrong here. I am a fan of Anderson's work in general, especially Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love. But I just could handle Hard Eight. Usually Anderson's slower pace is a welcome change for me as I really enjoy character driven dramas. The acting was pretty good, but I just thought the script lacked anything of interest. Maybe next time, but I can't recommend actually buying this one unless you want a complete Anderson collection."
4,"very noir, but with a very loose script","this is a pretty good film but the screenplay is a little bit forced and contrite, sometimes even a little too slow and boring. some scenes could be deleted to speed up it a notch."
1,Errors Galore!,"The book is easy to follow, but it does not follow Cubase SX 3.0. Perhaps the book was written with a beta version of Cubase. The book gives instructions to work with the software however, the software does not function in accordance with the book. This makes beginning Cubase learners struggle through the software, online help, and the book.The software is awesome, but the book has too many errors."
3,Overpriced LEGO/THOMAS marketing program,"Great little toy,well made as you would expect.Only 7-8 parts that snap together, not much to do with it on it's own but with a Lego set it is a nice addition. This item is just too high priced due to the combination of LEGO and THOMAS trademarks. $2-3 worth of plastic for 3x's that,will not be buying any more of these. I am generally against the use of oil for plastic toys with LEGO being an exception I could live with. Maybe it's time to get an erector set..."
1,Over my head,"I am a beginning video editor. This book was so technical it was like an engineering graduate school textbook--in my scope of knowledge. If you want to know esoteric details this book is good, I would suggest this book only for professional editors."
3,Good crackers but mine were also stale,"I like Ryvita and can't stop eating their crackers once I open a box. However, this order arrived smelling and tasting stale. I kept them and would toast them and cover with cream cheese, etc. I think they are a healthier alternative to other crackers.Amazon has a quality issue on many foods, apparently. They seem to have ""sales"" when items are close to expiring. This isn't the first time I've had something that was stale nor do I think it will be the last. Unfortunate. Just beware."
1,Pumpkin Seeds Spoil Quickly...So Did These Crackers,"I bought these crackers when they were marked down on Amazon, but I was extremely disappointed upon opening a box to discover that the crackers were rancid! The replacement shipment was no better - still spoiled. I think this is an inherent problem with the pumpkin seeds, as pumpkin seeds apparently spoil very quickly. When I picked off the pumpkin seeds (embedded in the crackers), the rest of the cracker smelled/tasted fine. But obviously, I can't do that with all of the crackers, since the pumpkin seeds are really baked in there. Since I think this is a defect with the product, I can't recommend these crackers."
1,NOT GOOD,"In the package I opened, the crackers were broken. That wasn't bad enough. They were also stale!"
1,Ryvita,"Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Pumpkin Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)I have been using this product for 2 years because I am a diabetic. I cannot find it where I moved to so I placed an order through Amazon. Never have I had a problem with anything I ordered through Amazon. This product arrived in crumbs. I have opened two boxes and both are broken pieces. The others sound broken when I shake them but I cannot open them because of staleness issue. I would like to cancel my delivery of every two months because of this."
4,Useful organizer,This tool organizer is well made and holds my Bonsai tools very neatly. It is great to be able to unroll it and have all my tools laid out in front of me and easily at hand!
5,The Travel Agency!,"Well, if I'm going Southern California here, might as well talk about the Travel Agency! Been played well in Santa Monica all the way up to Santa Barbara, and People, YES, they've also reached San Francisco, start digging up Your 60's Posters on Band Concerts, we'll ya! Well, any way, My favorite Songs on this Album are, Time, Make Love, Sorry You were Born, What's a Man and Cadillac George! Say, just for the Heck of it, on Your Computer, List all these Groups and just scatter the Songs, The Travel Agency, Stack, Blue Cheer and Clear Blue Sky! You'll be amazed on Production of Chord and Arrangements on a 3 Man Group! Pretty much Sounds the SAME! Thanks!"
1,Worst Plugs for MPV,"Goodyear Gemini put these Bosch Plat + 4 plugs in my MPV and only lasted 24,000 miles. They were all fouled. Car wouldn't start and was towed to shop. Shop indicated these Bosch Plat + 4 plugs don't work with MPV. Replaced with NGK 3186."
2,Not so hot,"After reading a couple of 'classic' system analysis texts I felt I needed to read about system analysis and UML. This title had some good reviews so I purchased a copy.This book did cover both system analysis and UML, but I felt that it did not cover either well. I had a hard time engaging with the content and linking it with my existing knowledge of UML and systems analysis.If you are interested in UML and systems analysis I would recommend reading ""Modern Structured Analysis"" (Yourdon Press Computing Series) by Edward Yourdon, and finding a good UML 2 text (I'm lookging for one now).For the price, I was expecting a much better book."
2,Not bad but acceptable,The book is serivicable...professor loved certain sections but hated others. There is no perfect textbook on this topic.
4,Excellent service. Book quality exactly as per description.,Received book right on time and the quality was exactly as it was supposed to be based on what was described in the book. Completely satisfied with what I'd payed for.
2,Confusing,"This book is just majorly confusing and really for the major eggheads. I'm using it because I have to for class but I'd rather go to another approach for learning this stuff. I'm using Learn to Program with C# by Smiley and it discusses some of the topics, from the early stages in the reading, as to the phases of development and because of that it helped me to understand this better. However, this stuff is really hard to grasp without the egghead mentality."
4,Good,"Pivi (""Samba"",""Kogno Koura"",""Djina Mousso"") and the virtuoses Diabate (""Koumanfe"",""Keba Mirima"",""N'FA"") provide the bulk of this selection, Keletigui's ""Donsoke"" is very engaging but Bembeya strikes out with the mediocre ""Mme Tolbert"". Very Good overall"
4,Not my favorite of the Urusei Yatsura books...,"I prefer the 'Perfect Collection', since it features Benten, Kurama, and Oyuki, who happen to be my favorite characters. Lum is cool too, but the above-mentioned catch more of my interest. The stories in this volume are okay.The binding on this book is horribly done. The glue does NOT hold, and the cover has already fallen off of my copy. I had come to expect more out of Viz Communications than that.That is really my only complaint with the book."
4,Very funny - a must for all Takahashi fans,"Lum: Urusei Yatsura could be the funniest series Takahashi has ever come out with. I'll admit I didn't think so upon my first reading of it, but I definately feel so now. Part of what I like about Takahashi-sensei is her sardonic view of high school (which I share). In a way, the troubles of high school are what this book is about -- even though the characters are totally off the wall.Lum is both Takahashi's strangest and sexiest series yet. I'm not sure it's for everybody, though. If you are new to manga, I wouldn't suggest you start here. However, if you are already a fan of Takahashi, definately look into this one."
1,Useless for tire mounting,I'm not sure what this product was made for but it is absolutely useless for tire mounting. It's basically soapy water. It evaporates in a matter of seconds after smearing it on the tire. Try another product for mounting.
1,USELESS!,I agree with th 1st review. Not worth the bottle it comes in. Go to the dollar store and get a bottle of dish soap.
3,it's ok,This tire lub was not as good as hoped it would be. I was looking for a more gel type tire lub.
2,Poor script and a lot of mis-opportunity.,"...I wasn't really satified with it. The plot was just ridiculous, it seems like someone just rushed the script or a high school student wrote it; that's how pathetic the script is. If you're wandering what I'm talking about, just go rent or buy the dvd or the vhs; and you'll see what I mean. I'm the type of fella who likes ""smart comedies"" and this film is absolutely ""not smart"" (for the lack of a better term), so I ended up not liking it. Althogh, I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale so I'm somewhat satisfied to add this DVD in my collection; that's pretty much the reason why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 as the rate. ..."
3,Region 1 DVD differs from original cut,"I thoroughly enjoyed this fine comedy at the cinema and bought the Region 1 DVD as soon as it hit the shelves.I'll leave the story details to the other reviewers, I just wish to point out that this disc has several scenes edited out from the original cut. This unneccesary editing spoiled my enjoyment somewhat and reduced my rating from a 4 to a 3.To be specific, I'm refering to the scene where the English middle-class enemies of our orphaned heroes trashed their makeshift home while spouting various patriotic phrases like ""England Forever!"" etc... It was quite an emotional scene to say the least, especially with the two heroes quivering in silent fear while these ""respectable gentlemen"" went about being total hooligans.I'm definitely going to get the original UK region 2 disc."
5,I'd give it TEN stars if it would let me! =),"This is one of my favorite movies! It is smart, charming, funny and very sweet. If there's a real Jez out there, someone let me know. I'm sad it didn't get more attention than it did. Excellent film!"
4,Fun to read!,My 7 year old son has enjoyed reading this book (and having it read to him) many times. We also find the game-playing tips very helpful as we work our way through Oracle of Seasons/GameBoy Advanced.It also includes some nice color pictures of the key characters... which is why I only give it 4 stars... wish there were more illustrations!Highly recommend this for any young reader who likes to determine his own storyline.
3,Used books = damaged books,I got this book used and a picture was torn out. The cover was dirty and beat up. The reading part of the book was in perfect condition tho. the option to chose your own path was not to often.
4,KICK AS* OLD SKOOL HARDCORE,this cd is greaat everything a hardcore punkrock album could BE GO BUY IT
1,"Most obscure songs of all time; flake book, not fake book unl",This is the largest collection of songs I have never heard of. I recognized such a small percent of them that I decided it would be useless. I returned it immediately.
2,Tommy Boy Poster,Note the word reproduction poster. Not the best clarity on the picture. It looks as though the picture was scanned and enlarged with some distortion or fuzziness. A 14 year old boy loves it but dad was not impressed with it's quality.
1,A Product Doesn't Get Any Crappier Than This!!!,"This umbrella light is the cheapest thing to come out of China!! I am so disapointed. How can a company sell such junk...What a disgrace!First of all, I have never taken the time to write a review, but if it will save just one person from this so called umbrella pole light...well, then this review will have done it's job!Just by looking at it, it breaks...it seems to be held together by cheap plastic and miro-thin wire. Not worth one cent! If i could have given a no star rating I would have.I am sending this back...and of course, it is at my expense!""Get Organizined"", (the vendor of this product) should be ashamed of themselves!!!!!"
1,very bad product.,i was excited but was soon disappointed after i noticed that it does not work. The wiring inside broke. Horrible product. please do not buy. I wish i could send the item back but i do not have the time and patience to do so.
4,works well,"well, it does exactly what i wanted it to do. it fits the pole and provides a lot of light."
4,Great product for the $$$,"My Mother had a similar product which she purchased at the local discount store a few years ago. After 3 summers of looking i finally, found this one and it works great. The LED lights provide great illumination, especially since I do not have a spotlight in the yard. It does take 4 AA batteries, but surprisingly, they do last for several hours stright, or at the very least a few nights out on the deck. Would purchase again and recomend to friends!"
1,No melodies in this melody book!,I expected a book with this title would have the music to go with the poems.Nope.
4,The Future Is Definitely Wild,"""The Future Is Wild"" is an interesting look at what life on Earth in the far, far future will be like. The book takes the reader to five million years, one hundred million years and two hundred million years to show how life on Earth may evolve through climatic changes and vast time changes.Although other reviewers may not agree with some of the proposed evolutionary suggestions, one must remember that all of the proposed evolutionary changes are based on speculation. There is no way to know what life will look like in five million years time; science bases those evolutionary theories on what we currently know about evolution and how life has evolved to its current day forms.Will squids eventually be the 'new intelligence' of the future? Will there be pack hunting sharks? Will fish develop bird-like traits? We have no way of knowing but ""The Future Is Wild"" provides both an entertaining as well as scientific look at what might be..."
1,Very disappointing.....,"While I loved Dixon's ""After Man: A Zoology of the Future"" with a lot of passion, ""The Future is Wild"" was the biggest disappointment in my quest for the studies of future evolution. While the mammals and birds amazed me, I was very disappointed toward the end when they started saying squids will take over the Earth. IAGH!!! Squids will NEVER take over the Earth. Maybe the waters, but never the Earth. Another thing that got me angry was this mess about the extinction of mammals. Well, if history has any bearing, major classes never die out, they become something else, like when dinosaurs evolved into modern birds."
2,Greeen's letters to the press,Disappointing. Expected more insights into events of the time and more interesting commentary. Not typical of what would have expected from Greene.
1,Help,I purchased a EVC1550 NTSC to PAL converter to record programs in USA to be viewed in Italy. I can't convert anything to PAL format at all. Anybody out there can help me? Thanks.Biava52588@aol.com.
1,PAL TO NTSC (not the oposite),I agree to the previous comments.Why NTSC to PAL aprox 50 u$s and PAL to NTSC 150 u$s (or more)?If anyone knows any PAL to NTSC converter in the price range of NTSC to PAL please e-mail me (pedro.rosenfeld@t-online.de).
5,The Phantom Designer,"This is a MUST have portfolio to add to your Star Wars collection. No true ""die-hard"" Star Wars enthusiast should be without it. The 20 prints are absolutely beautiful! Doug Chiang's paintings are captured faithfully in all their luxurious eye quenching colors, details and moods. Each lithograph (coated with a special hi-gloss PVC UV coating) can easily equal museum gallery quality when properly framed. I've had the fortune of personally meeting Doug in person and, his work positively reflects his personality; truly unmatched works of art."
2,Not Very Useful,"I found this book not helpful at all. Maybe I expected to much, but this book said little more than a sentence about each route. It didn't describe the routes or there difficulty to any extent at all. It gave no detail at all. If all you want is a book that tells you a sentence about the directions that you will travel than this is for you, but not for me!"
4,Not disappointed.,"Being Vernor Vinge stories, I was sure they would be great - and I wasn't wrong for the most part. Most of them were enjoyable. The only downside was that some of them were 'early' Vinge and thus a bit dated. But, even knwing this - I would buy this book again."
4,This is a selection of short stories which are well written,"These collection of stories are well put together and are very well written and i am looking forward to reading another book. I would recommend this book, but there are a few down sides."
2,Base too wide to fit properly on ceiling lampholders,The collar is too wide to fit securely on ceiling lampholders. Lampholders with a wider space for the bulb guard are not available. It was therefore very difficult to attach the guard and I feel it is not securely fastened.
2,Can Not Attach to Fixture,"The instructions on how to use this product elude me. In an effort to get the basket to hold tightly to the fixture I broke the ceramic base of the fixture. So now I have 4 lampholders in a box, 3 unprotected bulbs, and a broken fixture."
1,Cheesie,The Leviton 12200-W Replacement Guard for ceiling lampholders is an inadequate product for guarding lightbulbs in a confined space. It proved impossible to install in any way shape or form using the instructions provided. I would not recommend this product.
3,needed a little adjustment,"If you are putting this on a no collar type and using the 2 pieces to hold in place i would just change the porclain fixture, cause i had to use 1 1/4"" drywall screws to get the parts to come together and even then the clasp didn't work to great, i mainly did this for code and it is in a crawl space and attic."
2,disappointing,"This DVD has two Tintin epics. Tin Tin in America, and TinTin at the shark lake. The original Tin Tin in America is my favorite, however, its DVD version is a big disappointment. For some reason, they cut almost half of it, and the total duration is around 22 min. which is less than half of other epics in the series.I have not read the shark Lake before, therefore, it is new to me. I found it below average in both drawings and direction. The voices are different from all other Tin Tin epics and characters look different. Although it is relatively long (more than an hour) I did not enjoy it."
5,Intelli-pop,"The tunes are so catchy, you might have to force yourself to listen to the lyrics -- but it's worth it. Even the simplest ones (""Me and you, we're a tribe of two"") convey a feeling strongly, while some of the others, like the title track, verge on inspiring (""How do you want to be remembered -- a raging fire or a dying ember?""). I think the Kennedys are classed as folk partly because their lyrics actually mean something and partly because the folk world is more open to experiment -- the pop music world is propbably not ready for musicians having this much fun. The musical style is brand-new but reminiscient of late-1960s pop, ranging from neo-Byrds -- I especially like Roger McGuinn's playing Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring on the title cut -- to the Beatles in their sitar period (""Blackberry Rain"").This is my favorite of theirs so far, and is probably a good place to start listening to Pete and Maura, and to start tuning in to the connection between them so evident in every song."
5,Almost as good as seeing them live!,"The Kennedys are chameleons. Folk, pop, rock, bluegrass, they reincarnate with each tune. The consistent things, which are clear on this recording, are Pete's flawless guitar playing and Maura's clear, haunting voice. The tunes are all memorable- I find myself humming them all the time and my kids, ages 6 and 10, know most of the words. Is this a profound album? Hardly. But it never pretends to be anything more than it is- good music. If you get to see The Kennedys in performance, you'll run to buy their stuff. If you're just looking for something catchy, listenable, and fun, this album is for you. And if you like this, try Evolver (higher tech) or River of Fallen Stars (simpler and low tech). You might be surprised but you'll never be sorry."
1,TDK Ultimate Performance VIVID 6 Hr VHS Tape,"These VHS tapes are garbage. On short play, ALL (we bought 5) show distortion at the beginning of the tape. On long play they are completely unwatchable. If you are thinking it might be the VCR, think again, we have an older tape that looks perfect in short AND long play. I found better tapes at the $1 store back when you could find VHS tapes at the $1 store. Save your money."
1,Bad tapes,I bought 3 tapes of which 2 were bad and could not record on them. I called and was tole to throw those away and you would send 2 more to me. You did and they were bad too.
5,What a courageous lady!,"Anna ( Patty Duke), is a great lady! This book, An excellent and sad look at what a bipolar person goes through with and without help, I*m so happy that there is a name and treatment for this very sad illness. Anna tells it like it is and does it with class! May God Bless Anna Duke!"
5,A must for families and friends who suffer from manic depres,"It saddens me that this book is out of print. It is a must for families and friends who suffer from manic depression or live with one who does. It is a book that gives hope for the future and a path of healing....a process to take in order to heal. I feel it should be put back into the mainstream of bookstores, as since the time of writing more has been learned and acknowledged regarding this mental illness. The next generation (and also past) would benefit!"
5,Excellent!!,"This is an excellent book. It is more than Patty Duke's situation, which is very well presented in her own words. There are multiple examples of others experiences. It gave me a much greater understanding of my own experiences. It also helped de-stigmatized the disease for me. The single drawback is the discussion of Lithium; it was written before many of the current medications became available. This in no way detracts from the power of the book. I would, and have, high recommend it."
5,It was like looking into a mirror....,"Patty and Gloria have sketched a picture of life that has matched my own since the age of 16. Recently diagnosed bi-polar, I was scared, nervous, and more depressed than I was when I entered the hospital. Only because I was filled with all the misconceptions about this disease. This book took all the blinders off, and not only filled my head with knowledge, but hope and courage to face the demons of a very frightening disorder! Thank you Patty and Gloria."
3,Too much medical info.,Too much medical info. I skipped over a lot of it because it was too involved with medical terms and treatments. Not a book I would recommend.
2,A Revelation of what it's like to be manic-depressive,"If you want to know some of the unbelieveable, unbearable pain and suffering of an un-treated manic-depressive, read this book. How Patty Duke lived to tell her story is a miracle. Thank God she finally found her way out of her madness She gives hope to her fellow sufferers. From the perspective of gut-wrenching pain just reading her account, the book works wonderfully. But as a narrative, I found it hard to follow. I felt jerked around from eposide to eposide. There didn't seem to be a timeline I could follow to know what happened, when. Also, it was very distracting to have to plow through the pages of medical, technical information that were dispersed throughout the book. Overall, it's a fine description of the illness, but frustrating to read."
5,"Beautiful, rare color version of TIBURON","Like most film buffs, I had only seen the circulating black-and-white prints of MERMAIDS OF TIBURON. The DVD is a revelation, with gorgeous color. The B&W; version was more of a crime film, but the color version is primarily a showcase for the mermaids, who are shown swimming topless underwater, etc. This may have been the version that was released to adults-only theaters while being retitled THE AQUA SEX.The DVD also presents a hybrid print that is in color but deletes most of the topless footage. So, if you have an underwater enthusiast visiting who might not want to see the nudity, you can show the ""family"" version instead.The DVD presents the film in better quality than I ever expected for this title, and the image is letterboxed as well. However, my copy doesn't have the promised audio commentary track (perhaps they didn't get around to doing that). This is the best transfer of MERMAIDS OF TIBURON that we're likely to see."
5,Great for the Kid In All Of Us,"Colin McNaughton's charming tale of Jolly Roger running off to join the pirates to get away from his mother is perhaps more for the pleasure of adults than the very young reader. However, the tale is pleasurable for all ages...Instead of straight story with pictures, the pictures tell a lot of the story themselves, with the characters' dialogues bubbling out of their mouths and spilling across the pages. This gives each pirate and each character a really distinct personality, and brings the reader from the ""the pirates did this, Roger did that, his mother did this"" to a more character oriented book.The jokes may be a bit above the very young reader, but most children will understand and be entertained and adults reading the books may have to go back and enjoy it for themselves once the kids are tucked in bed!I ran across the book as a nanny to two little girls and bought a copy to keep for myself. I was ready to join a pirate ship myself after reading it! Enjoy!"
4,Love the songs!,"I was looking to replace/buy the soundtrack from the Winnie the Pooh movie from the '90's for our new granddaughter but found out that it was no longer available. This CD comes as close as you can get. The songs are great and just so sweet. The last couple of tracks are a little weird but the rest are just fantastic and even though I am an adult, when I'm feeling a little blue, I just play those first few and I feel better fast. I even have them on my IPod. And I can't wait to sing the songs to the baby!"
3,Classic Pooh Bear songs but not original artists,My son loves all of the songs he recognizes from the original movie. I was a bit disappointed that its different artists than in the original movie but he doesn't notice the difference so it's not that big of a deal.
1,Disappointed,A word of warning. This book is an 80 page collection of photos with very little text. It was compiled in 1943 by a serving German officer and lacks technical details. It is very much a work designed to inspire the German war effort rather than a historical study. It is interesting only as a primary source of German recruiting material.
4,CREATION and Charles Darwin,"A great movie with great actors. A bit slow at times, but hey. This is not an action film. Paul Bettany delivers a superb performance as Charles Darwin. There is one scene in the movie and I won't spoil it for fans, that I actually cried. There are touching scenes throughout this movie and Jennifer Connelly delivers her usual great performance.Now, that I've seen this film. I want to read more about Darwin and his writings. The Science vs. Religion issues are surfaced here. But, not in such a way to anger the viewer, as this is an inciteful issue.This is a great sit down movie. Break out the popcorn! A"
2,Duh!,"I expected something a lot better. The movie is boring, confusing, and pointless. The actors are great, but the plot is lame. It shows a middle-aged hallucinating Darwin as a total looser with a troubled and sad life. At one moment I suspected this movie had been made by religious organizations to discredit Darwin's theories.(!?) If the viewers are expecting a biography of Darwin's life and accomplishments, look elswhere. There must be better films on the market. Better yet, read Darwin's biography in a book. At least you won't feel ripped off."
1,Don't buy this movie.,"After reading Randal Keynes' book, which is the basis for this movie, and Darwin's own account of his life as well as his scientific contributions, this movie was a terrible disappointment. Where Keynes is balanced and careful this movie is excessive and biased. It is a fiction about a character loosely based on Darwin who we are to believe is struggling to the point of mental illness to reject a literalist, Book of Genesis, account of the origins of life on earth. The movie squanders an excellent cast of actors and the opportunity to provide a glimpse into the personal life of one of the world's greatest intellects. It fictionalizes history to make it fit into the current argument between those who accept the evidence for evolution as spelled out in Darwin's Origins of the Species and the Christian Creationist's and their theory of intelligent design. The result is a biased account of history and a story that makes Darwin appear to be a pathetic neurotic."
3,A Really Excellent First Step to Accepting the Beauty behind Creationism,"This DVD managed to begin with Darwin's most famous quote that suggests Intelligent Design and then show the overall ""proof"" behind Creationism without giving little more than the opening quote to nail the arguments behind Intelligent Design as tightly as I've seen them shown.I would recommend this DVD to anyone with some (a smidgion would be sufficient) scientific logic and a willingness to recognize where the arguments were carried just a bit too far ... yet, recognize the power of the arguments against Evolution as it is taught in modern schools.Generally speaking, this is a great video to use to make people at least think more deeply about evolutionary theory and the arguments for God by observing His Grand Design.The three star review was simply a recognition that Intelligent Design can stand on its own scientific precepts more than this video allowed it to--with its over-emphasis on religious narrative here and there."
4,an interesting film,this film is interesting and well worth the watch even if science isn't your thing. very good acting all around.
4,Great movie!!,NOt for someone who is looking for action or adventure but great for those who like documentary/ history type movies... great insight in the man - Charles Darwin!
1,Abominable Distortion,"I cannot recommend this to anyone. It is full of artsy-fartsy gimimicks, and it distorts the historical truth of nearly everything that it touches on. It is truly a work of fiction, and a poor one at that."
4,"A Study of the Man, not his Theory","This movie is a gripping narrative of the inner dilemma Darwin faced when cofronted with, what he believed to be, overwhelming evidence. Not as much a treatise on the correctness of evolution, it is more a character study of what a man must suffer to stand up for what he believes to be right in spite of his family and his own conscience. It is a sympathetic portrayal of one of the most influential thinkers in history and does an excellent job showing the sacrifice Darwin made to publish The Origin of the Species. Worth seeing regardless of your views regarding creation and evolution."
3,okay book,"good book, Interesting read from a good author. Fast flowing and found interesting , would recommended it to all readers"
4,Heat of the moon,"Excellent, kept me interested, I could. Or put it down, read it they from.start to finish in a few hours."
3,Heat of the Moon-a good read,A bit slow at times. Nice culmination of activity about mid-story. I would recommend this story. She did a great job of sluthing out the mysteries of her life.
4,Lovely job,"Excellent job of character development and study of family relationships, especially between the two sisters. Very interesting twists in this debut novel. Lovely writing."
5,A good read,This was a very good book. A real page turner! Kept me guessing until the end. I recommend this book
4,Great story,Made my crazy mother look like a sweetheart.! Good she didn't go to college. Loved this book and will read more of her work
4,Didn't want to stop reading,It is now 4 am and I just finished reading. This book submerged you into the main character's mind and took you along their journey for the truth. It had you guessing at what really happened in everyone's life and mental state. Very good read!
2,Overrated,"Not very realistic, who goes thru life with no birth certificate. Rachel does not have much backbone. Not really a mystery."
4,Hard to Forget,"Rachel is a character that spends the day with you, always in your mind as though she were an acquaintance to be concerned about. I read the second book first, and now I can understand her actions better. This is a tight novel with several twists that intrique the reader to unravel the secret backstory. I look forward to reading the next in the series."
5,A Stunning Debut,"A stunning debut from first time Author Sandra Parshall. Tightly written, breathtaking suspense filled mystery that takes you on a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Memorable characters pull you into the story with skeletons rattling in every closet. As the families deepest, darkest secrets begin to emerge, the suspense just keeps building until it explodes off the page in this delightful psychological thriller that will keep you up late into the night until you have finished every last page."
4,Nice read,"This was a pretty good book,with plenty of suspense. Good, fast-paced reading. I wish the author had resolved some of the emotions between the main characters, but it was pretty satisfying."
5,A Must Read,I picked this book from a list of free kindle books. The plot sounded interesting so I thought I would try it. I was definitely NOT disappointed. The story pulled me in and held on until I finished it. The characters were believable and you had feelings tor them. I was a little disappointed in the ending but not enough to lower my rating. I have already purchased the sequel and can't wait to read it. I can recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery that will keep you guessing.
2,Like reading a Lifetime movie...,"This book was like reading a Lifetime movie. Not quite sure what time the story is set in. If there hadn't been a reference to a cell phone, I would place the time from the early 90's or late 80's. There was also a reference to a vice president that I'm not too familiar with, so I know the author has a more ""seasoned"" point of view of life if you catch my drift. It was also way too melodramatic and too slow for my taste. The ending left me quite unsatisfied. Read at your own risk. The only positive I have about the book is that the author has an excellent writing style."
4,Great,"It is on the dark side but so good you can,t put it down. Lost memories that lead to a shocking discovery"
4,Good Story,Good Story all the way through until the end. It all ended a little too quickly. I liked all of the characters.. but in the end to so quickly give up was difficult to swallow. I understand why she did it - just would have like to have seen Michelle come out a little more.
4,Will keep you turning the page,"I will spare you a synopsis, as the book's web page does that nicely.I liked this book very much and was surprised to find out it was a debut novel, it was very polished and complete.There are so many unexpected turns in this book, there's never a dull moment. By the end of it all, you are so invested in the characters that you either love or hate how they react, but either way you completely understand them.That is not to say that I expected the end, I absolutely didn't, it was a complete surprise.There are a lot of things you could say about the Heat of the Moon, but predictable is not one of them. A great read."
3,Quick Read But Rather Predictable,This story is easy to read quickly - you do get rather caught up in the characters BUT it starts to drag in the middle and then becomes quite obvious to the end. It was a nice book but not a great book and I doubt I would read this author again.I found myself getting bored with the plot and my mind kept wandering to thoughts of the author rather than the characters - wondering what the heck she was thinking when she wrote this. That was quite distracting. It felt as though the author rushed the ending or something....?
3,The Heat is Just Warm,"Good light reading. Easy to get back into after a rest. Some of the scenes between the sisters were pretty flimsy. Not a really challenging book, but good for the beach!"
5,great suspense story.,"great story, edge of your seat kind of book. hard to put it down. clever plot twist and very suspenseful."
4,Easy and interesting reading from Amazon,"I rarely give five stars to a book, but 4 stars is a high rating for me. The characters were easy to get into. The book held my interest to the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries."
2,You Can't Grow Your Own House!,"A deceiving, gimmicky title that doesn't measure up to the book's contents.Lots of color pictures of absolutely huge bamboo community structures (NOT houses!) that basically all look the same. There's hardly any variety - just huge bamboo roofs suspended on bamboo stilts designed by the book's author.I bought the book because it mentions ""House"" in the title but it hardly has any ""houses"" in it... maybe photo's of 3 bamboo houses in total.The book is written in German text with an English translation printed alongside... so half of each text page is taken up with the German text.The book shows a few pictures of bamboo joints made by filling the ends with concrete and embedded bolts secured to metal joints. It doesn't tell you where to buy those joints because they are custom made.That was the most useful information found in the book from my perspective.So... I'm still looking for a book about bamboo houses!"
4,Trance in Bamako,"Issa Bagayogo has gone from being a divorced bus driver in Bamako to a musical sensation. Considering his skills as a musician, wondrously wielding the kamele n'goni (hunter's harp) and his smoky voice, it's hard to imagine him driving people to their destinations in the Mali's capital city.The opening title track of ""Sya"" opens with natural sounds,flowing water,birdsong.It's not the usual ""New Age with natural sounds"" however.It has a beat.""Diarabi"" has a haunting,mysterious sound.While the songs sometimes get repetitive,the entire album is a natural mix of traditional Malian music with technology.""Sya"" is ""Techno Issa""'s sterling sophomore follow-up.This album is a great introduction to African techno,and is perfectly combined with Putumayo's ""African Groove"" and Issa's third CD,""Tassoumakan"" (Voice of Fire)."
1,It works.. then what..,"Wow! A Cd that plays music, uhh and only music. It is rumoured (but I confirm it) If you put a music-only cd into a music-only cd burner then force the drive open, put a cheap blank cd in. It doesn't complain, and does the job. Buy the Memorex, they're cheap and do the job. Whats all this about 'sound quality' Its digital? Get a new cd player. And scratch-resistant? Just don't use it as a drinks coaster, put-it-back-in-the-box! For people stuck with a music-cd burner forced to pay rediculous Cd prices, swap it for a Pc burner."
4,Biblical tales understood as symbolic astronomy & science,"The author does a good job of identifying the astrological symbolism in the New & Old Testaments, including the solar mythos that parallels many other religious fables of the world. The author attempts to identify multiple levels of interpretation of Biblical passages, although the book is rather slim and really just scratches the surface of the levels of information encoded in the Bible. Besides the astronomical symbolism, there is also historical/racial propaganda, social engineering/moral persuasion, reference to extraterrestrial factions and activities, alchemical/spiritual symbolism for initiates, sacred geometry, and other types of coded information, involving multiple groups and agendas. A whole encyclopedia would be needed to thoroughly cover these topics."
1,Don't waste your money,Total psuedo - semi - scientific- new age garble. Save your money. Jabbar doesnt understand basic judeo-christian mythology. Nor is his astrology in anyway upto date or accurate. Another in his series of deceptive books. There are just too many problems to even start to pull this one apart. It should fall apart all on its own. I'd like to say something positive but can't. -5 out of 10 sorry Jabbar back to school with you!
3,"Interesting, but...","Too predictable. King foreshadows every event to the point of giving everything away. The ending was pretty lame and seemed like a last-minute bit thrown in to finish the story. Overall, it was much better than the first three books."
4,Good but...,"The wizard of oz part was lame, and the reappearance of the ""tick-tock"" man seemed like a hasty after-thought. King probably forgot that he left him alive in the third book and wanted to write him out as quickly as possible..."
5,I am truly enchanted by this series.,"I truly enjoyed these books. Unlike most (I suppose) I read them all in one sitting. I was most struck by Stephen's (had to use the first name at least once) development. The books grew with him. The first book, THE GUNSLINGER was almost childish in simplicity. By the time he got to THE DRAWING OF THE THREE one could see the King of IT and NEEDFUL THINGS emerging (remember I just read them having read many, many of his books before) and WIZARD AND GLASS is amazing. I am truly enchanted by a set of books that, before reading, I thought was a cowboy story (thus me never having read them before). The truth is, when I saw that his new novel THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON was on the shelves, I immediately thought, ""So THAT'S what he's been doing when he should have been writing The Dark Tower V!"" Nevertheless, I will as always purchase and voraciously devour his latest. Happy reading all!!!"
5,Fantastic read,"This book digs deep into Roland's past to help understand the darker side of his character. While the book does not carry Roland and his group much closer to the dark tower, it does help to explain the reasons for their quest. I especially liked the tie in with other King stories and the return of our old friend, Randall Flagg. This book also has one of the most morbid endings of any King book since Pet Sematary. It leaves you longing for the next chapter in the story, which hopefully won't take another five years. This book is a must for any fan of the Dark Tower series."
4,Better put on a seatbelt for this ride.,"In wizard and Glass, the fourth and much anticipated book in the Dark Tower series, Roland tells his Ka-tet a long ago story of his first love, and perhaphs his last true love. The book, containing a gurth of pages though most well wrote, is a little thick for the story Roland felt he must tell his mates, but if you are a true King fanatic like most you will enjoy the rich detail, wity characters and dialect, and the bits and pieces of Roland and his Ka-tet's future, a must read."
4,"At first, I was totally apalled, but it was worth it!","Let's get one thing straight. I only gave the book four stars because of the confusion at the beggining. When Roland started to tell the infamous Romeo and Juliet story, the names were different, the ka-tet was in a completely different place, and everything changed. At first I was severly dissapointed. The Dark Tower saga had everything going for itself, and then this?! But beneath the surface lied an even better story than the whole series itself. The books hommage to the Wizard of Oz was different, but still enjoyable. Ultimately, it was better than all it's previous ""Tower"" books. Not exactly non- stop action, but close enough to it to turn you into a King fan right after chapter one. Like all other good King books, not scary, but emotional and ""deep."""
4,"DT4: Great characters, compelling story, bad ending.","Before buying the book, I've read several reviews here saying that Part 2 and 3 of Wizard and Glass were boring. I disagree now that I have read the book, even if I'm not too thrilled by love stories. I think the flashback was necessary, we had to know about Roland's past. Part 3 is absolutely the best one, the charcaters are very well developped (especially Cuthbert, Susan, Jonas, Rhea and...Roland of course). The final showdown at the end of Part 3 is astonishing, it blew my head! Hile! To me gunslingers! The ending (Part 4) is major let down. I really didn't like the parallel with the Wizard of Oz story. The explanation about Maerlyn and Roland's mother was nice, but it could have been better. Anyway, I hope we won't have to wait another eternity to see DT5. I'm wondering if the action will take place in New York..."
3,1991 WAS A GOOD YEAR!,"I said it before, and one more time will I say it. 1991 two great novels flagged my attention. Both by a writer that we all ONCE loved to read. Needful Things and The Waste Lands were published in '91, and every novel since then has been an extreme disappointment! King went through a terrifying transformation and became a regular dull person. I bought this particular novel the day it slid into bookstores. I was eager and willing to wade through another 700 page King novel, especially because it was of the Dark Tower series and the previous three I gave high ratings. I was engrossed all the way up to the point of which he discussed his teacher and mistress Susan. I only continued through the novel because I wished to find out what the large glass tower in the city the travellers had journeyed toward. I gave this one a 5 rating, and perhaps that is a little generous of me."
1,Typical 1990s King,"Mr. King, regretfully has become a better actor than author. His first works were wonderful detailed stories. Now his works are suitable for the funny papers or soap operas. On and on and on and on ad nauseatum"
1,"My God, this book is horrible","I ordinarily like Stephen King, but he tends to get bogged down in details at times. This is one of those times. Leaving the extremely interesting story of Roland of Gilead and his current companions, King drags a story of lost love out WAY TOO LONG. Don't buy this--just skip to the next one, if it ever comes out."
2,Romance in the middle of a horror novel?????,"I really enjoyed the first three Dark Tower books, so I figured I would read this one. After the first few pages, Stephen KIng goes back into Rolands past to write about Rolands first love. Gag me. It would have been ok if she was a tough female and had some substance, but she didn't! And why do we want to read a love story in the middle of a horror novel? I wanted to skip past that part, but somehow I finally got through it all and the only reason I did was because I thought that maybe it would get better. I guess it did, because she died so now we don't have to hear about her much more. However, the first three books in the series are quite good (I especially liked number 2) so do read those, and just skim this one. Hopefully book 5 will be better."
4,I decided to be generous,"I do know the face of my father, but I have a feeling even my father would have had a hard time staying awake for this one. Let me just say that the fist 100 pages dealing with Roland, Jake, Eddie and Blane are excellent after that the book hit the dirt--hard. It is important to learn about Roland's past but did they have to it in such a boring manner? I can't see how he feel in love with the women myself though she was beautiful and all that. The book redemmed itself at the end when Roland, Alan and Cuthburt went on the warpath. I can't wait to see how King wraps these books up.If you are just starting out with this serise start with the first in line(#1) and work your way up."
1,Wizard and Glass,"This was the most disappointing Stephen King book I have read - and I have read just about everything he has written. There is nothing original here. He borrows from Lord of the Rings, he borrow from Star Wars, the Wizard of Oz, and himself (The Stand, The Talisman co-written with Peter Straub). The net result is a book that simply does not hang together and is really impossible to take seriously."
2,Far From King's Best,"While I'm not surprised that most people are gushing over this book, I am surprised that others have picked up on what I have griped on about W&G. The interlude/flashback story was for me a real chore to get through. It was like reading a young adult romance novel. The hero and heroine perfect and flawless mentally and physically versus the bad guys who either slept with whores or were ugly outside as well as in. It was completely unrealistic and boring and irritating to read. The closest thing I can think of is watching a James Bond movie. You know what's going to happen before it happens and the characters (Susan the stereotypical strong female heroine) and storyline (hint, don't blame me, it was ka.)were predictable and poorly drawn. Forget the trouble with the Dark Tower, someone needs to put right was has been plaguing King's writing these last few years. The sickness has even spread to the Dark Tower."
1,YERRR OUT,"Because he is The Great Stephen King, he can't get a 1. But like any great home run hitter King either drives it over the fence, or he strikes out. Mr. King...go have a seat on the bench.."
2,Will the real Stephen King please stand up?,"I really wanted to like this book. The first three volumes in the Dark Tower saga are some of my favourite King novels of all time. Unfortunately, Wizard and Glass will not join them. DT4 starts off great, concluding the tale of Blaine, the psychotic, riddle-loving monorail. From there, it moves on to a long, drawn out flashback that contributes very little to the mythology of the Dark Tower. Lastly, just when it looks like we may get back to the real story, King slaps together a truly awful Wizard of Oz scenario. If you're looking for a sappy romance with a heavy helping of B-Western tragedy thrown in, give it a shot. However, if you're expecting more tales of adventure in Midworld, wait for the next volume. You won't have missed a thing. Maybe it's just me, but I haven't like a single King book since Needful Things. Wouldn't it be ironic to find that his talent was buried in the ruins of Castle Rock?"
5,The Best of King's Dark Tower Series!,"A wonderful trip back into Roland's past. It put a depth into Roland's character that I felt was interesting, needed and filled in a lot of blanks. Also, the ending makes you want to get into the next Dark Tower book now! Ka rules."
5,Wow! Simply amazing...,"I was absorbed into the Dark Tower series when I received the first 3 books for last Christmas. When I found out about IV, I had to buy it as soon as I could, even though it didn't match my other books. It is one of his best! Although I wished it had more of the Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy storyline, the history of Roland was a part that couldn't be missed. Who couldn't fall in love with Susan Delgado's character? But The Wizard and Galss is my second favorite Dark Tower, the first being number 2. Keep up good work and please hurry with the 5th. I don't know if I can wait."
5,Stephen King at his Best,"I've read more than half of King's books, and Nothing captures my attention as much as his Dark Tower series, which is the best fantasy series I have read to date. Wizard and Glass kept me up many nights because I just couldn't put this book down. A must for any fan of Stephen King or Fantasy"
5,"Great Job, Mr. King!!","I have read all of the Dark Tower series, and I eagerly anticipated the fourth installment. I was surprised by the 400 page flashback to Roland's past, but it added a nice flavor to the story. I was very impressed with Mr. King's tone during that section. He really did a great job of describing the emotions felt by all. I feel that he described the flashback as if he had lived it. I was deeply disturbed by Susan's death, and felt as though she was a close friend of mine. To me that is what being a phenomenal author is all about. Thank you for the fourth installment, Mr. King. Hurry with the next."
5,Absolutely one of King's best books,"In the fourth installment of King's DT saga readers find out more about Roland's past and his human side. This book is entertaining and completely the reader into the world that King has created. Anyone who feels this book starts off slow, hasn't read much King. The way The Stand and the Wizard of Oz are tied in is really interesting. This book is a fun read if you like King and the DT series."
4,"It wasn't the best, but it's GREAT!","I thought the initial clash with Blaine was superbly done! Very clever. The story of Roland's troubled 14th year was also well-written; a nice, meaty develpment of a hostile situation. I thought the ending was horrible. It felt like Stephen said, ""OK, 750 pages is enough, let me just wrap this sucker up quick."" Selah. I can't wait for the Dark Tower, part 5."
4,Roland as a youg man.,"In this installment of the DT series we learn a great deal more about Roland, along with several other characters from his early years as a gunslinger. Roland and his friends are sent to the edge of the civilization for their safety only to find that they are in more danger than they would have been at home. We meet Roland's one true love Susan and his best friend Cuthburt in this volume. We learn of the events that shaped Roland as a young man and gain a better understanding of the gunslinger and his quest for the Dark Tower. Parts of the plot are a little hokey but all in all a good book. Other than the beginning and ending of the book which features his current ka-tet this volume is the one book in the DT series that could truly stand on it's own as a single very entertaining story."
5,The Wizard and Glass,"I read the first sieres when I was in middle school and I was hooked, but who knew Stephen King could write a love story? And not some sloppy, sappy love story desperate housewives keep under thier mattresses, but an innocent, beatuiful and as one critic presicly stated earthy. I hate to say that is the one of the most beutifully written romance stories I have read. For the story itself, it was a needed addition in to the insight of the main characters story which until then had been very unknown. This alters the mood and feel of the story and continuing on from there the mood and feeling of the story changes with this new insight into the Roland. As for 800 pages being too long? Number one, that critic evidentually had not read many other Stephen King books, which 800 pages are normal and with a story like this it doesn't even matter."
4,Good Timing for Back Story,"When you hear that this book completely leaves the current story and goes back in time to the main character's past you would think this would be a bad thing. But the timing for it is just right; the group of characters on a quest for the Dark Tower have been through a lot already and at this point the author either has the option to bring them to the tower and end the story or to make the characters a little deeper and reveal a little more of the story. I'm glad King decided to do the latter. It was a good break from the actual story and, if anything, it increases the excitement for the last part of the story. I'm certainly looking forward to finding out what the dark tower is very soon."
5,Great Series,"Only wish this had narration on the Kindle Fire, so I could have it read to me when I'm to busy to read myself."
5,Best of the series hands down,"This was a departure from the series, it was refreshing, it seemed to capture a youthful innocence, I have read this book at least 5 times, I honestly believe there is more to tell about this particular story, perhaps Mr. King will in the future give us an update on the characters that may in fact become part of a future volume. If you dont know what I am talking about you will of course have to read the book."
4,"Not the best of the series, but still an excellent story","While Wizard and Glass may not further the character's position in their world(s?) much, it offers an interesting look back into the past of Roland and the world that has ""moved on."" And while nothing can come close to touching the simply amazing power of the Wastelands, this book comes close, and it still stands out head and shoulders above your average fantasy, or even your average Stephen King novel."
5,"Captivating, I felt as if I were there with them.",This is one book where I wished he would be MORE wordy like he was in IT. King transmits a feeling of being there with the characters and I continue to think of them as real people.
5,"King employs classic ""in media res"" format to great effect","Sequels as a rule don't live up to the first installment, but Wizard and Glass is a strong exception. This is my favorite of the Dark Tower books. Roland's 400-page flashback is not without precident. The bulk of Homer's Odyssey is told in this format, as is Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (and there is that Star Wars prequel thing...). It is a proven formula that adds much to King's epic-in-progress. It was great to catch a full glimpse of the glory and horror of Roland's past, which has only been hinted at before. This book is King at his best--an unlikely and beautiful combination of the grotesque and the poetic. Note: People who can't handle the perceptive, mind-bending artwork in this tome probably shouldn't be reading Stephen King."
5,The Genius of his Genre Returns,"Steven King just keeps getting better and better. His more recent novels, including INSOMNIA, DESPERATION, and, finally, the long-awaited DARK TOWER IV, WIZARD AND GLASS, show that age and experience are sitting well with the world's best-selling novelist. Unlike the other Dark Tower books, this one gives a hint of Roland's inner self, and a startling link between the ka-tet of the past and that of the present. Possibly the best King yet."
3,We waited 5 years for this?,"I have been an avid reader of Stephen King since the beginning. I have read the Gunslinger Series a dozen times. And while Wizard's and Glass answers several questions from the earlier books. Stephen King uses 500 pages to answer what could have been answer in 200 to 250. By the end of the book I had lost interest in what was going on or even cared. Mr. King seems to have gotten away from what made the gunslinger series so good and just started rambling on as he did in desperation and the regulators. I hope it is not another five years for the next one and I hope he gets back on track with Roland, Eddie, Suzanne, Jake and Oy. Don't get me wrong I still want to learn more about Cuthburt and Alain but not a whole book of it"
3,The wizard....,"I read the remaining books some time after this was released, not that it matters. They are for the most part seperate readings. All of them could use editing getting rid of extraneous text."
4,a sequel and a prequel!,Number four of Kings Dark Tower starts off amazing tying up some loose ends. Then the story goes into some reflecting bits. Most of this book tells the story of Roland many years before taking up his search for the Tower. This is a good thing and a bad thing.The Good: You really get to know the mysterious Roland so much better. His back story is exciting and emotional. It also tells a self contained story within the confines of this large series. Characters are great and King manages to keep the suspense pretty high.The Bad: It loses some of the narrative edge of the last two because it really is just a story Roland tells. That means you don't get as much of Rolands Ka tet as you might like.Overall this is just another solid entry into the Dark Tower saga. Constant Reader is entertained.
2,My Least Favorite of the Series So Far,"While the writing is still brilliant and Stephen King creates an incredible story. I was dying to see my beloved characters get closer to their Dark Tower, but most of the book is a flashback to a particular episode of Roland's past. If this had been the first or second book in the series, I would probably have been just fine with this, but at this point I was so invested in the current quest that I didn't want to spend an entire novel focusing on the backstory of only one of them. However, if you've made it this far, you must keep reading. The Dark Tower is only a few books away..."
3,Engrossing story marred by sappy romance and unjustified length,"It's a page turner, and sparks my mind's eye. Unfortunately the story is filled with sappy, sometimes trashy traverses into teenage love and sex, making me think I was reading some housewive's embarassing romance novel kept hidden in a drawer. Is this Harlequin Romance or Stephen King? And, the book is way too long for the story being told. I actually love very long novels, but the endlessness of this one hindered rather than helped the plot. There is a LOT of plodding along in low gear to find out what happens. As usual with Stephen King, the antagonists are much more interesting then the heros, as the protagonists can come off rather one dimensional, slaves to the good, the right, and to love. Yawn."
4,Great! If only he had quit while he was ahead.,Great midpoint in the Dark Tower saga. Unfortunately it is all downhill after this one. King would have served himself and the series well to stop here. Recommeded if you already came this far in the series.
3,It was disappointing till the very end.,This was a long wait for nothing. King certainly could have stayed with the tower theme and not introduce Roland's boring romance past. It was 400 pages of boredom. The book was not bad but it was surely not his best. But I will still eagerly anticapate his next book in the series
3,"4 stars for the story, but 2 stars for being unnecessary","Doesn't it make sense that the fourth book in a series should move you forward? King spent 400 pages filling in detail that didn't need to be filled in. He tries to make up for this in the last 50 pages with some creative, although hurried and confused nonsense that moves the gunslinger's troupe along.This is not to say that this isn't a good story. As disappointed as I was with the path he took, I have to admit that I didn't like to put the book down. Overall 4 stars for the story, 2 stars for this failing to add anything meaningful to King's series. I'll still read the 5th book. Hopefully he wont take another 10 years to put it out. And hopefully it will add something."
2,Nice to see the story continue but.....boring!,"I really waited a long time for this one and was sorely disappointed. It was nice to see the next book come out, though, and I look forward to the fifth and hopefully better book."
2,Worst of the dark tower- books.,"There is some good parts in this book, but mostly it's VERY boring. Lovestory between Roland and Susan is the worst part; I havent ever read anything that boring and irritating. I hope that next book is much better."
4,enjoyed this volume,"All I seem to read and hear from everyone is how they disliked the major portion of the book which goes back to Rolands past.I personally enjoyed this part of the book and the love story.King is a great writer but once in a while small parts of his writing semm to make me think he is a little twisted in the mind, but very intelligent. I enjoyed this book as much as the others in the series and look forward to the next but hated to see his love get burned alive.I suggest readers go to his web site and read his interview with amazon.com - he tells of a few other books to read that have characters that will be in the final 3 books. They include ""eyes of the dragon"" and ""hearts in atlantis"". His web site is www.stephenking.com"
2,The Journey to The Dark Tower stalls...,"Steven King writes an epic western, a tale of love and sacrifice. Too bad he used this series to tell the story. This could have been a tale set in the old west, another genre King could have been put his stamp on but instead the reader is sent through a journey into Roland's past. King's a craftsman and the story moves along but it didn't move the journey towards the tower any closer. It was a story King felt he needed to tell but maybe it didn't need to be part of Roland's journey."
5,the best book I'v ever read,"I absoloutly loved this book.As soon I picked it up and started reading it I found myself having trouble putting it down.I would say this was the best book I'v ever read,I strongly recommend it."
5,King Rules!,I loved the tale of Roland and company.It was a real page turner.But five years awaiting thats the reason King drew a nine from me on this one.
5,Wizard and Glass...Absolutely the best,"It had been so long since I had read the first three volumes that I searched through all my old paperbacks and found the second and third volumes. I ended up buying ""The Gunslinger"" again and started the series from the beginning. Talk about an adventure!!! I didn't want any of it to end. In my opinion, Wizard and Glass is the best of the series. The length of the book just made it that more interesting. I LOVE LONG BOOKS. I can't wait for the next volume. I really hope we don't have to wait too long. W & G is as good, if not better than ""The Stand"" (I 've read The Stand three times). The dialect Mr. King uses in W & G keeps you on your toes! At times I laughed out loud! I recommend re-reading the first three books because of the references often made to other events in Roland's past. Life for you, Life for your crops!!!"
1,Unsure,"After following Stephen King on his road to ""stardom"" I cannot believe that he would limit a title to 40,000 copies as he has this book. It is a slap in the face for any of the ""over 40,000"" fans who were unable to obtain this book. I ordered it well in advance of publication and will think long and hard about whether I will pursue purchasing this book in light of Mr King's obvious indifference to his fans (the people who took him to where he is!)"
2,Makes my brain ache.,Wizard and Glass is my favorite book of all time. I've read it three times and my sister gave me the audiobook to listen to at bedtime. I absolutely HATE Frank Muller's narration. The voices he does are so twangy and stupid it totally ruins the book for me. I had to stop listening after the second track.
4,Hard to put down!,"This book was what I was waiting for. This, the fourth book of this series, really filled in the blanks of Roland's past. If you have read the first 3 books and couldn't wait for more adventures of the Gunslinger, you will really sink your teeth into Wizard and Glass."
4,The story continue (sort-of).,"I'm a BIG fan of the Dark Tower series, and have been since I accidentally fell upon Dark Tower II. I loved it and went back to read Dark Tower I, and Dark Tower III. What gripped me from the beginning was the uniqueness of the entire story-line and the entire fact that they were making progress (although slowly). I'm only about 1/2 way through the book so far, but I am a little disappointed that the entire book (so far) is a flash back. I've been hooked by the entire environment created by King, but the flashback has been a little bit of a disappointment. However, the book is great reading (hence the rating of an 8)!"
1,The book that could have been,"once you get to know roland you really want to enter his sould and his deep eyes as they enter adulthood from the chains of childhood, however stephend king gives us his own twisted, sexually ""charged"" version of a super Roland boy that in the end sees that the world has indeed ""moved on""by him, a nice try but a dry tale that lets you feeling like ""what you did is legal and you had a right to do it, but it does not mean that it is nice""... Try it... or not... it makes no difference to me"
5,Excellent,Received the book in just a few days in good condition. Greatly appreciate such great service!
5,Journeys,"Stephen King has picked up the threads of the previous Dark Tower novels, and begun deftly weaving his spell once more.Wizard and Glass continues to follow Roland and his friends on their quest for the Tower. In the previous novels, the path our adventurers followed often took strange and wondrous turns - and Wizard and Glass is no exception. In order to move forward, Roland must delve into the past which haunts him, and share his memories with his fellow travelers. It's a cathartic experience - one that serves to bind the ka-tet even closer as they move once more along the path to the Tower.King shows one of his strengths by refusing to make us ride the story-telling bullet train. Instead, he takes us down back roads and scenic routes, and reminds us once more that the pleasure is not in the destination, but in the journey we take to reach it."
4,LEAST FAVORITE OF STEPHEN KING'S COLLECTION,"I've got to admit that I was waiting with baited breath (for years!!) for Wizard and Glass. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this book. I found it slightly boring. The general story was great but I felt that there was far too much detail. Usually I love the detail that Stephen King goes into - it adds to the story - in this case I felt that it was mostly filler. This, however, does not put me off - I greatly look forward to the next in the series and Stephen King remains one of my favorites!"
5,a book wonderfully sculpted by the wizard of fiction.,"This book reclaims King's place at the crown of fiction story writers.Wizard and Glass is a wonderful blend of love, mystery, jealousy, murder, and war.This books keeps us anxious for the next book in Roland's quest for the Dark Tower."
2,"hard reading, a sad, depressing story","I loved the first three Dark Tower books. Wizard and Glass is well written, but I don't enjoy reading depressing books, nor books where I know one of my favorite characters is doomed to die horribly. If you paid attention to clues in the first three books, you know exactly how this book ends--and it ain't nice.Wizard in Glass is 90 percent prehistory and like all prequels it suffers because the reader knows what's going to happen. It's like watching the prequel Star Wars movies knowing that Anakin Skywalker is inevitably going to become Dark Vader (Wizard and Glass is waaaaay better written than those movies, however).This book fleshes out and enriches Roland's character, ultimately making him better for it, but I found myself flipping pages (tapping, I suppose, on my Kindle) to get through it. It took weeks of forced reading to get through. The first three Dark Tower books I could not put down.I'm on to book 5, hoping the momentum of the story returns."
5,Keeps on keeping on...,Another great installment in this series. This is probably my second favorite book in the whole series. I couldn't put it down!
3,"Nice flashback,silly ending, not worth 5 years of waiting","This was a good read. Quite fun and like many other readers I could not put it down.However, it appears that King really has no idea where the story is going. After a 500+ page flash back he gives us a contrived crossover with another of his books and (just for the heck of it I suppose) the Wizard of Oz.King has taken this series from an epic quest to a mega-crossover sur-realistic mess. I fear that there is no plan, only mildly clever ideas thrown together at random.I really didn't need to see Roland in ruby red cowboy boots. I really didn't."
3,"I love the series, but,","The book is well written, and I love the series, but, The Wizard and tthe glass isn't the best. I found the plot line interesting, itself, but, it lacked something, or i should rather say it had TOO much of something. The beginning was captivating, but as the book progressed, and Roland started to tell his story, that part was streacted out a lot. In my opinion it went on and on andon for ever, it could of been condenesed a least a little bit and it would of been better. The end where they were in the warped ""Oz"" was very good too."
2,"Series Takes Huge Step Backwards, Literally and Figuratively.","I really enjoyed The Waste Lands (Book 3), but I found this book nearly impossible to finish. It felt like filler, not really adding anything interesting to the series. I felt like the book was going backwards when it should have been going forward."
3,Not worth the wait.,"I'm a big fan of this series and have eagerly awaited each book. But this one was pointless. What a disappointment. The story was a complete sidetrack to the main story and was about 100 pages too long. I still don't understand why Susan was so important that Mr. King had to devote an entire book to her. Maybe I missed or forgotten something. Can someone fill me in? Also, I didn't like the Wizard of Oz tie-in at the end. Skip this book and move on to number 5."
3,"Slow starting, but a great finish","The book is just like my title says. I ended up setting this book down many times and picking it up again at a later date. I felt like I was about 300 pages into the novel before I really got interested. I felt that the story was just dragging along and I was reading page after page, but the plot didn't move forward. But I'm glad that I finally did finish the book. When I reached the second half of the book I just couldn't put it down. The book also leaves you with a bit of a cliffhanger and a strong desire to get straight to book five."
5,The man is a Genius!,"i was on a cross country trip with my grandparents, and we listened to this. i loved it so much i went back to the begining of the series and started reading. King's imagination is limitless. This is a brilliant work."
4,Keystone,"Loved the back story of Roland's youth. This is the keystone that brings together two semi-arches that encompass ""King 's Worlds"". No recommendation needed, if you're this far into Mid-World, you can no more give it up than Rhea could give up The Wizards Glass!"
5,Fantastic !!,So far my favorite book of the best and most original work of literature I have ever been exposed to. King is a master.
4,My 2nd favorite in the series,"King does it to me again with Wizard and Glass. It was at first hard to get into but after the first hundred or so pages It became harder and harder for me to put it down. It was fasinating to read about Rolands adventures as a young gunslinger. I felt that this was Kings most romantic work in the Dark Tower. If you have not read the first three, what are you waiting for? If you have, then do not miss out on an extrodinary continuation to a gripping story."
3,"Bulky, overweight, but still a lot of fun.","Stephen King over writes. His works are bulky, overweight. But everyone knows that. The stories aren't slow, they're just fat. This story, like others, is probably more than some would prefer, but why read the Dark Tower series just of a short story fix? This book isn't a Burger King quick meal, but it's a long wonderful feast for those who know Roland."
5,Dark Tower Book 4,"This in my opinion is the best book in the series, you really get to connect with Roland and where he came from, his best friends and the love of his life. It was the best written story I have ever read! Stephen King is a mastermind."
2,A Disappointing Continuation,"Although Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" series is by far the most gripping and suspenseful set of books I have ever had the joy of reading, Wizard and Glass was, in my opinion, a poor addition to the series. Not only is King's grasp of human emotion desperately melodramatic, but the ungodly amount of cliche was practically unbearable.I struggled to finish the story only for the small fraction of pages that dealt with the storyline of our small band of heroes. That was as excellent as the previous books. The flashback to Roland's past, however, was horrible, and I hated every word of it.I would still recommend the series to anyone who loves any genre, even those who do not like King's work, as they are, as I aforementioned, outstanding. This book, however, is not up to par with the rest of them."
3,This is the worst in the series,"This book was definitely not as exciting as the previous volumes in the Dark Tower series. The story of Roland's past was way too long, and I found myself skipping about 80 pages. The whole Randall Flagg thing sucked, too, and the Wizard of Oz part was very cheesy. I hope the next part in the series is better than W and G."
1,Pete,"I thought the first two books of the series were great and the third was good, but this was a major disapointment. Almost the whole book is a flashback that has nothing to do with the main dark tower story. And it's a sappy lover story to boot."
2,shoddy,"for all of you King freaks - a little reality. King isn't anywhere near ""literary"" - his prose is passive and unimaginative (too many was's and is's, too much telling and not enough showing). Compared to horror kingpin's Poe and Lovecraft, King is shoddy - his novels are Pulp Fiction, nothing poetic about them. BUT - King does focus on character-based, rather than plot-based fiction - this is what makes him worthwhile to read - focusing on the characters of his stories.I love his Dark Tower series - surrealistic and mysterious. This 4th one, though, Wizard and Gass, disappointed me - too much straight storytelling, and hackneyed characterization. Pulp and not enough mystery. Bleh.."
5,spellbinding,"My review will add little over what others have written, except to indicate that I am amazed at the insight demonstrated in this sequel to the Dark Tower series. In particular I find it fascinating that King alludes to the Glass even in his Wasteland story, although briefly. Yet, he doesn't complete this fourth series for several years. I am amazed at his presence of mind to continue this story in the depth he does. Kudos to Stephen King - I agree that this series even tops ""The Stand"", one of the finest stories ever told. I eagerly await the next release."
4,Tolkein?,"Why is everything connected to Tolkein & friends? Every other review says that King is either better than Tolkein or that King doesn't deserve to lick his boots. If you love Tolkein so much, go reread Lord of the Rings and don't bother with King's books. It's not like King needs you as a fan. That goes for all the other writers he's been compared to (Heinlein, etc.) too.Besides that, I think Wizard and Glass is a great book and I am looking forward to the next one in the series."
2,Mediocre!!! Not worth reading,"SK has obviously struggled with the entire series and all four books are filled with inconsistencies and contradictions as pointed out by a previous reviewer. When he can't make parts of the story come together he just wings it and somewhow muddles through. He has become to busy as Stephen King Inc., to give us the benefit of his unique talents. While he does have a phenomenal imagination, his writing has become mediocre. He hasn't produced anything worthwhile for a long time. As it were, this book and the entire series is not worth reading and there are too many books available in this world that are worthwile."
5,Why so few copies???,"I come from South Africa and have been an avid reader of King's works for as long as I can remember. Of all these works, by far the most awe-inspiring is the Dark Tower series. My problem is that until I stumbled across this page, I did not even know the fourth part had been published. Such is the importance to American publishers of our market. But, to my horror, I see that it is only a limited edition. This basically means that NONE of King's many South African fans will ever get a chance to read this. Why oh why? I guess he, like many other Americans, believes the world ends at their borders. Please think of your international fans next time Stephen King."
3,So......we have another 1/2 porn story.....come on sk!!!!,"I really enjoyed the other DTS books...so when this one came out, I bought it right away. The way he tied W&G in with ""The Stand"" was amazing.......but how can he stoop to the level of writers trying to please the public??? It's no doubt that ""sex"" books are selling now, so when I read the detailed descriptions of Roland and Susan's passion, I was almost outraged at SK. I have often urged my school-mates to read his DT books, but I have not uttered a single word about this one to anyone....exept for maybe ""W&G just wasn't as good"".......come on SK....don't try to be like those little porn freak authors....be the daring and diffrent SK that we all love."
3,Top Ten Problems with Wizard and Glass,"1. Far too much time spent on pointless subplot/flashback that doesn't advance the plot.2. Roland's background only mildly fleshed out; most of the book was dedicated to a period of a mere three months out of his whole life, and those in a hick town, not even Gilead.3. Justice is not served in the end.4. Elements clearly lifted from Tolkien, and not in a good way.5. Mythology of Dark Tower itself no clearer than before.6. Slapped-together Wizard of Oz sequence.7. TickTockMan fails to impress.8. Anticlimax battles in which heroes have it way too easy.9. Appealing character burned at stake for no apparent reason other than a last-minute sense that the book wasn't horrifying enough.10. Simply too long."
4,The Gunslinger,"Mate,Stephen King Knows how to draw you into his own Fanasty world,Having read all 4 Books in this series, i can hardly wait for the next installment, i only hope we dont have to wait to long.I'm not going to tell you anything about this book because it will do you know good unless you have read the other 3 books and if you have, then you gotta get your hands on this one."
2,THERE IS ANOTHER CHAPTER AFTER THIS BOOK!!!,"Hello...I already reviewed this a few months back (didn't like the book much, too much romance which I can't stand, and it gives details about Roland's past that I preferred to have remain a mystery). BUT I wanted to let all of you who LOVE this series to know that there is another part of the story not contained in the 4 main books. Read ""LEGENDS"" an anthology which contains a great 'Gunslinger' story called ""The Little Sisters of Eluria."" It is MUST READ stuff for fans of the Dark Tower series. Editied by Martin Greenberg."
2,Please help me find the plot.,"Although I have thorougly enjoyed the series so far, I feel that Mr King has been allowed far to much license by his editors in recent years and has stopped considering that his readers might want to have a life outside spending several weeks reading his latest work. The ongoing plot of The Dark Tower cycle occupies less than a fifth of this weighty tome, The remainder being an extended look into the past of the central character, The Gunslinger-Roland. Although we were promised this in the argument at the end of the (first or second, I forget) book, had I realised that this was all the fourth book would contain I would have been less eager for it's publication (Oh, and look, here's Randall Flagg again, what a surprise!) Heres hoping Mr King can find it in his heart to try and return to form for the next offering from Rolands world."
4,"Thankee-sai, Mr. King...","...for giving us another fix of Roland and his never-ending quest. I don't think it's the best of the Dark Tower series but at least I can stop scratching that nagging itch. Seven years is a long time to wait, but maybe that's part of the journey. The Dark Tower series is the best of King's storytelling. And like any story worth telling, it will take time. So don't be impatient with the flashback, or the length, or the wait. Or else you'll miss the story."
4,The ending... the horror...the horror...,"Gosh... this book is a glorious dive off of the the high board. A swan dive into double twist, and a double flip- all perfect- then to finish we have a frickin cannonball. I was expecting a clean splash that would lead us into the next book... instead I am stunned by the turn it took- anyway I look at it I have to assume it's later writing for Mr. King. The good news is Stephen has promised to get back up the ladder again and maybe the cannonball was part a a bigger performance piece- triple lindy in the works...? perhaps."
2,Ho hum - The last 50 pages were worth it,"Alright...I admit that some background is nice but a whole novel dedicated to it? I found that this installment in the Dark Tower series was pointless and boring. The story itself was very well written but could have been narrowed into 100 pages. Compared to the other Dark Tower books..this one pales in excitment and intrigue. Shouldn't the novel focus more on ""The Dark Tower"" (hence the title of the series) and less on Rolands past? I must say that the last 50 pages of the novel was worth the monotany of the the first part. Hopefully the next installment will be more of how they get to the tower and less of a history lesson."
3,Not thrilled at all...,"I will start off by saying that I loved the first three books and I read all four books in a week, BUT this last one left me extremely unsatisfied. I won't recap the book, others have done that better than I would, I will only tell you my thoughts on this installment.I think that 800 pages was excellent and all the books should be this long, but I think that the story of Roland's love and loss went on for way too long and the Wizard story was laughably too short. King went on and on in the love story talking about everything, even if it was relevant or not, but the wizard section only received about 10 pages and that whole part felt unbelievably forced.Which is really a shame because the first three books were really something special and the Drawling OF Three was particularly good.Well not all books can be a winner, and I will be patiently waiting for the next book. It hopefully will come out soon!!"
2,"The book was good, to a limit.","I mean that the story-telling was great. But the way that King writes is he makes people want more. I thought that the book would clear everything up, and it did. The problem I had was the length. I wanted him to end the book. Now we all have to wait for the fifth book, which by the way these stories are coming out will be awhile."
5,A wonderful shift in gears!,I loved this book. It lends insight to what makes Roland tick; until now he was the biggest enigma in the ka-tet. Through use of this flashback story we finally begin to understand where the Gunslinger's single-minded pursuit of the Dark Tower stems from. He also becomes more human in the reader's eyes as a result. Hopefully Mr. King will now continue with the plot in a more linear fashion. I would hate to see this story going nowhere fast in the fashion of Robert Jordan's WOT. Thanks for a great read!!
5,WOW!!! Another thrilling book from the master of writing,"Yet again Stephen King manages to grip me throughout an entire book! I was given the book by a friend and I hadn't read the rest of the series, but the book looked boring so I put off reading it for months, then in the end I gave in. I just wish I had realised how good it was earlier! I was gripped from right at the beginning despite the fact that it is a little confusing at first. I just can't wait to get the other books! The tale of how they journey on Blane the Mono, then the flashbacks to Rolands' boyhood really keep the book fascinating. This book is worth all five of it's stars. I would reccomend it to anyone."
4,Takes a while.,"Because this is the fourth book is the series, I found it kind of hard at first to stomach the idea that the entire book was going to be a flashback. But, after a while (100 pgs or so) I easily accepted it for what it was and actually found it pretty enjoyable. King wraps up the climax from the previous book and moves the story forward in places intermingled throughout the book while at the same time not losing track of the flashback story being told. Not as good as the last book, but overall an enoyable novel.Pros-Wraps up the ""super-cliffhanger"" from Book 3.Fleshes out Roland's life and previous ka-tet.Good story in and of itself.Unlike a lot of other King books, it has a pretty good resolution for the flashback story.Cons-Seems to pause the quest for the Dark Tower.Takes a while to get going.The Ending of the ""present story"" is kind of goofy."
4,Takes us on a journey back in time.,"The dark tower 4 (wizard and glass) picks up right where the wastelands end and then takes us somewhere we haven't yet been. The long past youth of roland deschain, and the one and only love of his life susan delgado. From here the book takes off revealing alot of rolands backstory as a young man in love and the sacrifices he makes for that love as the ka-tet journeys on. At first i didn't think i was going to be able to get into it, but it grew on me."
2,This series is too long.,I'm on book 4 of the Dark Tower Series and I need a break. I think that the only reason I've read this far is the cliff hangers. But I don't really care at this point. Maybe I'll come back to it again someday.
4,The Sons of the Dragon King,This would be a great book to read to young children. Loved the story line of a great King accepting the traits of his sons and showing them how to live wonderful lives.The story line was not that great but still I immensly enjoyed it and the drawings.
1,"Charged restocking fee for wrong Amazon ""does it fit""","Charged restocking fee for wrong Amazon ""does it fit"".That pretty much says it all. I followed the advice of amazon and ordered the part Amazon said was the right part. I ended up paying to ship the part back, and was charged a restocking fee. I ended up with about half of my 40.00 bucks after it was all said and done. I had a chance to reorder the right part and I went elsewhere.I will still do business with Amazon. I already have since this happened. Just be careful and make sure you are ordering the right part. Amazon is a great place to shop and I will always do business with them.Car parts are tricky."
5,Basketball,This is an excellent basketball hoop. Our 18 month old just loves it. He plays whenever he is awake!!! It even withstands his 13 and 14 year old cousins. Suggestion: Get extra balls!
4,Easy Score Basketball set,"This toy was a present for a two year old. It is very user friendly, and can grow with the little fellow..I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,Fun while it lasted,"My son got this when he was 3. My 5 year old daughter thought it would be fun to lay it down and sit on it like it was a horse or something. The basket cracked. Before that, the tiny red piece of plastic that is used to adjust the height was lost, so it had to be used at the shortest height. We found the piece, and my husband superglued the basket. It worked until the first slam-dunk. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted."
2,ANNOYING and not well built,"This toy was purchased for my 3 year old son who loves basketball. He loves to play with it but there is no volume control and the music repeats so often it is absolutely annoying. My son actually asked me to turn the volume off so I took the batteries out. Additionally, the stand is almost broken at the bottom because he likes to dunk the basketballs in. I can't wait until it breaks so I can buy him a straightforward basketball hoop."
4,Rim job,"I was disappointed that the rim of this basketball set did not stay put. After about 5-6 shots, the rim falls out of place and the parent must replace it. It made it very difficult for my son to play continually, without interruption."
5,Fun for Everyone!!,"We bought this for our 15 month old son for Christmas and he really enjoys it!! Within minutes he had figured out how to put the ball into the hoop! It is a great toy for learning coordination. Plus, my husband and I have a fun time playing with it with our son! It seems like it is going to hold up well. We might have to fill the base though for a little more stability. I saw on another review someone said something about turning the music off on this toy because it was annoying, but there is no music on it. They must have meant to review something else I think. We all love and enjoy this toy!! It's fun for everyone!"
1,What a disappointment,"I've purchased many Little Tikes toys; however, this one was a definite disappointment. My two year old loves basketball and loves all of her other Little Tikes toys. Immediately after purchasing it; she was so excited that she could hardly wait until we put it together. Assembly is easy and very painless. However, the plastic rim continues to detach from the baseboard during play. The plastic lacks the ability to remain attached even during light play. When she walks up and gently places the ball into the net, the rim still falls onto the floor. She is very disappointed. Our family is very displeased in the durability and performance of the Easy Score Basketball set."
4,Great beginning basketball set,"Our son (now 22 months old) got this basketball set when he was 18 months old. Made entirely of plastic, I had doubts about its durability. Sure enough, our son thought that hanging on the rim and bending it down was the object of the game. It took about a week to change his focus from the rim to putting the ball in the hoop. He has progressed from laying the ball in the hoop to short set shots.After 4 months, the rim has been bent down a little, but the basketball set is still functional and fun.After our recent move, we lost the piece that allows height adjustment. We were able to order a replacement from the Little Tike's website. Nice.Oh, 1 more thing. Dad and Mom have a good time playing with the basketball set too. I recommend it."
4,Great toy.,"We bought this for our 22 mo old son for christmas. He loves to play ball...any kind. An even younger child, like 18 month would be a good intro for this toy also. He really likes this. I think it will endure his roughness. It was easy to put together. Santa appreciated that. Enjoy."
5,The best Christmas present!,I bought this basketball set for my son's Christmas gift this year. My husband loves it as much as my son! When my husband gets home from work they spend at least 30 mins playing ball. It is easy to adjust and the ball is just right for his little hands. We live in an apartment so it stays inside and we don't have sand in it. This is hands down the most used toy in his very very very extensive collection!
3,Little Tykes EasyScore Basketball Set,"The basketball net was missing from the box. This was a Christmas gift for my nephew, who lives out of state, and my attempts at getting the missing part have been futile. Needless to say, that will be my last order."
3,Should have listened....,I should have listened to other reviewers! The rim falls off afterevry five to ten shots. Great idea but poor design. Thumbs down!
1,weak piece of junk,"do not buy this toy, it is weak weak weak, one shot and it breaks, find another brand,please!"
2,Return Item,"I was looking forward to setting this up. My toddler loves to play ball, and he was interested in the basketball hoop at Gymboree. However, I found two problems with this set, and I'm returning it after one day of play. First, the plug for the water hole does not plug in tightly. If the base is tipped over, water spills out. Second, the rim/hoop falls down every three times my toddler puts the ball in. He loves to shoot the ball, but I have to keep putting the rim back in. I'll be looking for another set."
1,DO NOT BE FOOLED,"I paid more than I should have. I overpaid because this toy was advertised in cute girly colors, yellow and purple. I could have spent $10 less and gotten free shipping had I known I was going to get a blue and black toy. Colors aside, this toy snaps together and is shoddy. It does not need to grow with your child bc it will fall apart by then."
3,"Kids loved it, but not in best shape out of box.","I bought this for my kids for Christmas. 3-16 months. When takin it out of the box on Christmas Eve, I noticed it was prettty scratched up. Not sure if this was a return or re-sold. Being it was the night before Christmas, I went with it. Good product, just wish it was in new condition."
4,No Net,I purposely purchased this online so as to send as a gift to my 3 year old nephew across the country. NO NET - and now I'm spending my time tracking down how to get a net shipped to him. What gives that so many of us are not getting this toy shipped as complete? Very unhappy!
1,insecure hoop,"I bought this toy for my two-year-old granddaughter. It would be fun and educational if the hoop didn't detach from the backboard almost every time the ball goes through the basket or bounces off the rim. I've tried taping and tying the hoop to the backboard, but nothing works. Consequently, she's given up and so have I. This toy is a waste of money!"
2,"Fun, but no net","We received this as a gift for my 18 month old son this past Christmas. We were very disappointed to find that the basketball set came without a net in the box (and I notice that I'm not the only reviewer to have this problem). I haven't heard back from the seller despite trying to contact them multiple times by phone, email and product help on their website. I finally gave up and ordered a net directly from Little Tikes. On the plus side, we haven't had any trouble with the rim falling off!"
3,infomative book,This book while giving all the information nessary to build the gun is still a little patchy in its information and you realy need to know about firearms in the first place to fully understand it.If you have a basic knolage of the insides of firearms you should find this book infomative and enjoyable to read.
3,Great hobby machinist project.,"I purchased this book (and another book with similar themes and content)as a challenge to teach myself some fundamental engineering and lathe techniques. This was because I had found it difficult to find any general purpose project related plans and schematics on the internet which seemed relevant and instructive.While I never had an intention of building a final working model, I'd say that an average person wouldn't be able to do so anyway. To create the auto pistol from the enclosed plans would require a person with considerable technical knowledge and experience, coupled with an impressive home workshop, with milling and lathe machinery.For the hobbyist wanting a challenging project - at least to experiment with some of the techniques, this is quite an informative book. I was impressed enough to consider purchasing other titles and videao by the author to see what they have to offer."
3,Good book for general knowledge.,"I like the book. There is not quite enough info in the book to produce a working weapon, but almost. The author refers to earlier books in the series to explain severial details during the building process. Overall, however, this is a good book."
2,They don't make the magazines for this design anymore.,"This book is not for beginners. You will need a lathe and milling machine and the knowledge to use these machines correctly. From page 9 of the text: ""A suitable magazine for this gun is available (at the time of this writing) from Gun Parts Corporation, West Hurley, New York. The company calls these ""Universal"" magazines. They are used in Thompson .22-caliber guns as well as a number of others."" Unfortunately, the Thompson in .22LR is no longer being made. Hence the 30-round magazine are no longer made as well. And without a magazine, a machine pistol becomes a single shot weapon. So the design in the book is basically outdated right out of the gate. If you can find/obtain a 30 round, .22LR magazine from another manufacturer (or can make one yourself) and then modify the measurements of the lower receiver to accept the new magazine, then you might find this book a worthwhile purchase."
2,bill holmes is stupid,it is no bilderds manual its a storry fore kids. by in sted matrel s 9mm mp bok its alot better. cheers from norway
5,A tribute to Django from Babik Reinhardt and Bireli Lagrene!,"Django Reinhardt's melodic and harmonic ideas, solo style and general technique have been recycled, absorbed and spread by generations of jazz and blues guitarists. This tribute to Europe's first jazz master is a blistering set of duets performed by groundbreaking Gypsy guitarist Bireli Lagrene and Django's son, Babik. Includes Django's composition ""Nuages.""#1347 (26 min, Hi-Fi Stereo)"
4,"Not what I expected, but still awesome","I was a bit dissapointed by the short length of the video, and though I was expecting more homage to be payed towards Django, this was a worthy purchase. Bireli and Babik play only one Django song ""Nuages"", along with some Bireli originals. If you are a musician or a fan of gypsy swing, you should see this to understand a newer interpretation of this genre."
1,Don't waste your time,I was very disappointed with this video. I was expecting some straightforward gypsy swing playing. Buyer beware.
1,Yawn,"I was getting ancy waiting for the third Abarat book, so I bought this one to tide me over. Big mistake. I was extremely dissapointed after reading this one. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Barker fan, but Imajica was slow, hard to get through, and generally uninteresting. Maybe it isn't fair to try to compare Imajica to Abarat, but there it is."
2,Barker should be known as 'Plot's unlimited'.,"Pure claptrap. It seems Barker is trying to reinvent the plot by making his story lines more and more complicated. This seems to satisfy the ardent reader of such work, but Imajica falls short in its intellectual accessiblity to develop universal meaning because of its suffocatingly convoluted themes and self-important phliosophies. He is a great writer caught inside the tangles of his own webs of great intensions lost, huge themes bloated and bursting indifference. Somehow the story's other world(s) expectations get lost in the clutter of spiritual nonsense and cross migrating sexes. But I got to hand it to him; precious few others can weave that mucky web of plotting like Mr. Barker can"
3,Barker is in love with his own writing,"Although original, Barker could have written this book in 300 pages rather than 1000. Too wordy, and plot much more complex than it should have been."
5,Cool Cover. Better book. You can judge a b. by a c.,"I bought this book cause it had a cool cover. I was not disappointed!! If anything, a book this good deserves a cover like the one I saw. I didn't even know what it was about when I bought it. Intricate plots, a complete world of magic creatures and mysteries just beyond reach. Moderate characterization with oh-so-cool non-sequiteurs that make you go ""Huh?"" and read all the more hungrily for answers. Worthy of Clive Barker. Gotta read it!!!"
4,"A magical rollercoaster, rife with contradictions","This is an amazing book. It's built around love-hate relationships. It's fitting that's exactly how I feel about it. Central to the Imagica is reunification, but the story splits apart male and female into halves that can never be joined together. On the social level, males are only capable of destruction, conquest, and imposing limitations. All aspects of life-giving, forgiveness, and healing are the sole property of women and the Goddesses. But on the individual level, only men are responsible for the healing of the Imagica (the five Maestros are male, and Gentle's whole entourage is male). Gentle's chosen mate isn't even a woman, it's a hermaphodite. Women in the book are out for personal gain, vengeance, or both. I can't decide if the Imagica is militantly feminist, or misogynist. All I know is that it's been years since I've been so emotionally overwhelmed by a novel. If you need a story of hope in your life, read this book"
2,So sad.. so bad,"I am the biggest Doctor Who fan I know. I own 45 vhs tapes full of eps that were taped off of public TV in the 80s and 90s. Oh how I had forgotten how bad this ep was until I watched teh DVD I just purchased. I never liked Sylvester McCoy. I am, being 37, your stereotypical Tom Baker fan, but SM was always just annoying whereas the other doctors were just different.. I did however have a vague recollection that there was a SM ep I liked and thought it was this one. Nope. It was Ghost Light. Acting is bad at best. Plot suffers from too little said to let you know what the hades is going on yet too much babbling about other personal issues that meant squat to fans of the show. ugh.. Buy the Two Doctors instead. Much superior. I wish I had. ugh.. bad bad bad.On the good side. Monsters looked good. From about 20 feet away."
1,A Confusing Mess,"I've always had problems with this story and I had to by the extended version on this DVD to make sure I wasn't just going nuts. It IS one of the better McCoy stories, and that's the good news. The bad news is that it's still awful. There's WAY too much going on in this story to have it make sense in the short amount of time television gives you to explain it. There's tons of subplots, various theories about what's actually going on in the story, too many characters, and the whole thing just comes off as a pompous mess. I was hoping that an extended version might help to explain it. It does, but it only scratches the surface of explaining what's happening. Would have made a great book, but it was a crappy script for this show."
2,Hi! I MAKE NO SENSE!!...,That's what this DVD with a SPECIAL EDITION of THE CURSE OF FENRIC should be called...CHEESY...OVERWRITTEN...BORING...and why is the sound so bad?ACE is the best thing about the SYLVESTOR MCCOY episodes...cuz he certainly isn't...just DREADFUL and so re-written that the character of DOCTOR WHO becomes CONTRIVED and conventional which was something it never was before. The SYLVESTOR MCCOY years took all the fun out of DOCTOR WHO and turn it into drivel. This episode is TERRIBLE.It makes no sense...is badly edited and ridiculously over plotted. WHO CARES?!! Even DOCTOR WHO himself would not watch this eyesore!!
4,The best of a bad bunch,"By the time the original series got around to the 7th Doctor (Sylvester McCoy), the series was a shadow of its former self, which can be seen in the currently available on dvd Pyramids of Mars, The Talons of Weng-Chiang, The Aztecs, etc....Still, the 7th Doctor ""era"" which lasted the equivilant of 1.5 seasons in the Tom Baker era, had the occasional high point.This story is the top of the heap when it comes to the 7th Doctor.My advice is to watch the special edition version of the story, on disc 2 instead of the orignial version on disc 1. The new version has added scenes, updated music and some better post production work making it flow and look better."
5,One of the DRs best epesodes...,THis is one of the best Dr. Who episodes from the last season before the new Dr. WHo shows re-started on the BBC. The DVD version has more additional info and easier to replay different scenes than using VHS. I would recommend this if you are trying to collect Dr. Who episodes - one of the best ones - get it!!
2,Cursed indeed!,"What is truly frightening is that this is one of the better 7th Doctor stories, and it is still awful. This one is at least watchable, with no Kangs in sight, but once again, the story suffers from McCoy's acting. Either he simply can't act, and hamming it up is just his method of acting or he refuses to take the material seriously. Either way, he is just incapable of saving a bad script in the way Tom baker could on the strength of his charm alone. This episode is one of the strongest in his run, so if you are a fan of his Doctor, definitely pick it up, but on its own merits, I cannot recomend this one at all"
4,The best characterization of a companion EVER,This story has tons in it -- maybe too much -- but it keeps you engrossed and makes you realize why Ace is so darn popular.
2,The return of the Monster Era.,"If you have a camp like love for the monster era then this classic monster story might be for you. Personally I prefer a more timelord/time travel science fiction based story line. (like the 5 doctors) For a moment I thought the director of this episode might have been Ed Wood, it is cheesy, which I wouldn't mind if it was done with style. There is a lack of atmosphere,and frankly it is too well lit for scary theme. It does not persuade."
3,Curse of Fenric,This was among the last of the 1st series of Doctor Who. BBC didn't put much money into making it. That was sad becuse it could have been good.
5,Give me some of that!,"The new case that protects the actual disk isnt a joke. I had a few accidents involving an enraged 2 yearold and a minidisc. The minidisc came out of the battle without a scratch. Also, the actual disk is of A+ grade too."
5,Great! Except...,"This is the third bread machine I've owned. The first one was one of those old ones that looked like R2D2 with the glass dome. It walked off the counter one too many times. The next was a Breadman. The motor burned out after only a couple of years. I'd always heard that the Zojirushi's were the best, and the reviews were good on this one, so I bought it. It makes beautiful bread with great ease, and I like the more conventional shape of the loaf. However, it's made for a 2-pound loaf, and if you make a smaller one it's going to come out lopsided. Evidently with the two blades, one gets greedy and gets more dough on it than the other one. I don't mind the lopsided loaves for my personal use, but if you really want a beautiful loaf, make sure it's a 2-pounder."
5,Works for Me (TM),"I swore I'd never use a bread machine, but that was before I moved into a cabin with countertops that I haven't built yet.I'm a darn good bread baker myself, but I'm very impressed by the quality - and ""normal"" shape - of the loaves from this machine. I grudgingly admit that I'll be happy not having to knead sticky dough for the medium term future.The machine is very sturdy, with the usual excellent Japanese small appliance build, similar to Panasonic/National.With regard to the non-stick coating: you should never wash the inside of a bread maker tray or high-end rice cooker pot with anything other than a damp cloth, moistened with detergent if necessary. Do not even think about putting these items in a dishwasher or in a sink with other dishes. Don't touch the inside with anything other than a plastic utensil."
1,ZO IS A NO ON MY LIST,My wife got machine for Christmas 2009. January 2010 cycles quit working. Would not go past knead cycle. Just kept repeating. Sent to Zo factory in California for repair. They have had it a week and still no idea what is wrong. I have gone to Customer Service Manager and she supposedly expedited the technical review process. So far they say electrical and mechanical is ok but agree that it does not make bread properly. They are still investigating. When I pay 2-3 times what most bread machines cost I expect service beyond a year. I know that all electronics may have problems but I expect the manufacturer to make it good. Zo has not. I will never purchase anything from them again.
2,"Amazing Dough, DANGEROUS Flaw, METAL SHAVINGS in bread.","Let me begin by saying that this machine can make excellent dough with minimal effort.The downside is this: the paddles that kneed and stir the dough fit so loosely that the metal that connects them to the rotating shaft begins to wear away. This leads to **METAL SHAVINGS LEFT INSIDE THE DOUGH.** I know I cannot be the only person to have this happen, and probably wouldn't have noticed unless I hadn't been making dough and not letting the machine cook it as well.I emailed Zo, but they said there was nothing they could do except send me new paddles which would have the same issue with loose fit. So, if you end up purchasing this machine be sure to check for this problem after making several loaves!"
5,outstanding!,"first bread machine i have owned. i have nothing to compare it with, but this machine does outstanding! my first loaf was perfect. thanks to amazon for the great price!"
2,zojirushi Bread machine,"I would not recommend this bread machine. The following things I have found that are not good?No 1 The loaves are very uneven unless you catch it on the rise time and straighten out the dough.No 2 The dough balls up on one paddle only while mixing. So much for two paddles.No 3 The paddle comes off too easily. Even comes off sometimes while the bread is mixing.No 4 The pan is very touchy to insert in the mixer. Has to be JUST right for it to work,No 5 The beep sound is very weak and you have to stay in kitchen to hear it to add fruit, ect.No 6 It is too costly as compared to other brands."
1,Very Asia and Amazon Do NOT Follow Through,"I attempted to order this item through a wedding gift registry on Amazon. They sent the order through Very Asia. The item was never delivered and Very Asia cancelled my order without my input. The item has now doubled in price in less than a month and Very Asia will not return any of my calls (despite requesting me to call ""immediately"" via email and voice messages). Amazon refuses to stand by the product or the original price and has left me hanging without the gift that I ordered in good faith.I would advise people to be VERY careful in ordering any gifts through a Amazon gift registry."
1,my worst nightmare,"I have owned a panasonic bread machine in the past which just quit working. I thought I would try this machine because of the high recommendations of the earlier model. Boy, is this a dud. I made 3 different loves of bread. I followed the instructions as printed but each one came out terrible. Even with the crust color selection mode, the top of the bread barely bakes and the sides get hard. The so called non stick pan is certainly not.I do not recommed this machine to anyone. If I could rate it as a zero, I would!!!!"
2,unsure what the smell is...,Just got my Zo and don't understand why there's a smell of Ozone from it and now spreading throughout the apartment. Did this happen to anyone's first attempt? I thought it might be because it's new?? Unless the machine has been damaged? It did come with a damaged liquid measuring cup that was cracked on the bottom. Can anyone answer me??
1,Work in Progress,"The cycles are 1) mixing 2) rising 3) kneading 4) rising 5)baking.Our previous breadmaker was a Panasonic, which made nice, light, well textured bread.The bread so far on the Zojirushi is heavy on the bottom of th loaf and too light on the top, indicating that cycle (3) does not knead the dough long enough.The last loaf, made today, is still not right, but is better, probably because we used a fast rising yeast.We are now trying to reprogram the cycle times.We understand that each breadmaker is different. We are trying to find the right combination for the bread recipe we want to use. Since we have not yet found the correct (for us) program, we are ubnable to rate the machine at this time."
3,SPIRITROY,"IT IS A SOLID BUILT MACHINE---BUT ITS COMPETITOR IS LESS COSTLY TO DO THE SAME.THEY MAKE SIZES--1,11/2,2 POUND LOAFS --THIS MACHINE IS ESSENTIALLY FOR 2 LB LOAFS.THE TELOPHONE SERVICE IS GREAT AT (JESSE)ZOJIRUSHII PREFER THE BREADMAN MACHINE."
1,broken and not replacable,"I ordered my new zojirushi bread machine to replace the 15 year old model that finally gave up. I make 1-2 loaves a week so it gets used and the old zojirushi has been great.The new one arrived and the first loaf looked like a balloon. Most of the dough was on one side of the pan resulting in a horrible looking and unevenly baked loaf of bread. On to the second loaf.......As I watched the kneading, I realized that one of the two kneading blades would not turn, therefore the dough all ends up on one side of the pan.No problem, I thought. Just let Amazon know and I can return this one for a new one. No such luck. I am returning the faulty model for a refund but Amazon cannot provide me with a new unbroken Zojirushi. My option is refund or I could buy a new model for $40 more.Disappointed to say the least."
3,a problem,"I used it once and it worked ok. The 2nd time, I got a mild shock from the inside pan. My voltage checker indicated considerable voltage inside and around the exterior the machine. The company took it back by UPS and is sending me another. Otherwise, the shipping was fine and the one loaf I did cook was OK.Got the machine back 9/23/2009 and checked the voltage again. Using a multimeter and puting the positive lead on the heating element (surrounding and under the pan) and the negative on the household ground, the voltage was 90 volts AC. Called the co and they promised to send out a new machine.10/21/2011: Never got this problem resolved. The company looked into the problem and said is was operating properly. My meter still shows 90VAC. Not enough to kill, but I don't like getting shocked. So the machine is now on the shelf and unused.By the way, I also bought one for my son and he is getting the same voltage reading."
4,Execelent Home Bakery Machine,"If you are searching for an excellent bread/bakery machine, thisZojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machineis an excellent choice. You can bake bread, make pastry dough and you can even cook a meat loaf in this machine."
3,Decent performance,The package arrived on time and was packed well. It was a gift for my parents and they enjoyed it while it lasted. They no longer use it to make bread because it no longer works.
5,extreme satisfaction,the breadmaker i bought from you is phenomenal!!!!infallible!!!supreme!!!makes me master of the home bread!!!I am extremely happy with it!
4,Great machine but recipes aren't so good,"This is my first bread machine and I researched a lot of them before deciding on this one. I really like it but the recipes it comes with are awful. It recommends that you only use their recipes but I recommend you don't use any of them. None of them have tasted very good. I've tried several of them but none of them are very flavorful. The size and texture was good but no taste. I started using the recipes from www.allrecipes.com and everything has been wonderful from there. Also, it's kindof strange that it comes with a VHS tape for instructions to the bread machine instead of a DVD. Who has a VCR to watch it now days? I just read the instructions that came with it so I don't know if the VHS tape is neccessary to watch or not but I think I have done fine without it."
2,Not happy with product,"We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients. We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work. Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate."
5,I like the shape of the loaf,"So far, this machine has made great bread. I chose it in particular because it makes more of a regular size/shape loaf of bread rather than the round, vertical cylinders of bread some machines make. So the bread fits in your toaster, etc. Lots of options for timing, although I haven't tried to delay the baking of the loaf yet. That's next."
5,"Yummmm! Yeah, it's like that!","For my bday I wanted a breadmachine (bm), as a never ending effort to feed my hubby and thee kids heathy food. I got this bm because it's one of the ""best"" on the market, as we go through tons of bread! I have never owned a bm before so I don't have anything to compare it to, except.. I found this recipe for bread that required you to take the dough out three times before it baked so it could rise properly. What was the point of a bm if you had to do that?! So, I figured it was a good challenge for the bm. I made a loaf and the bm made one. The bread came out better then by hand. I recomended letting the bm cool completely between loafs (I think it caused my second loaf not to rise as much). I would totally recomend this again, and again, and...:)!"
5,Love this bread machine.,"The bread machine was more than I was going to spend.My research showed this machine highly rated. This machine was worth every penny. I have made white ,french, sour dough ,cinnamon raisin, and wheat. All loaves were perfect. The recipies were all included.Watching the Dvd (also included) helprd as the intructions differed from my old machine. Amazon had the best price."
5,Great Machine,I really like this bread machine. Mostly I used the dough setting. But have tried the jam and it is good but not quite like homemade. Would be great over pancakes. The cake setting is good and you just dump it in and it mixes and cooks for you. Bread setting works great too. I like the fact it is shaped like a loaf of bread not a cylinder. This is my 2nd bread machine and I would recomend this machine.
5,Wonderful for the Celiac person,Gave this to my son-in-law who has Celiac's disease and loves bread. He is very impressed with the bread quality. Says it is as good as store bought and is good for days. He has tried from scratch mixes many times and they are always heavy and only edible for one day.A great success.
5,Best damn bread machine I ever owned (this is the first),"Super easy to use. No fuss, just dump in the ingredients, turn it on and go do something else. Clean up is even better cause there is none. You have fresh bread when you want it without leaving your house. Now all I need is a machine that makes beer."
3,"It's good, not perfect","I only use this machine to mix dough. I find it takes longer to mix and the dough doesn't rise as high as the dough in my other machines. (I have 3) I make a lot of bread and usually have all 3 machines going at the same time. This machine rises the least and is more doughy when baked. I've read all the instructions and tried many different ways to play with the recipes. I bought this machine recently, yet my machine I've had for over 10 years works better. (I also own Westbend and Breadman bread machines.)"
2,Recipe Challenged,"I paid a premium for this product believing it to be the best. Having two ""paddles"" seemed advantageous.So far three loaves of bread per the recipes accompanying the maching (all three different) have had the same result. Very non-uniform in appearance. All could not have been mixed properly - or the recipes were very wrong for the machine.So far, very disapointed, but I will continue to try."
5,Best yet Bread Maker,"This is our fourth bread machine in 15 years. Our last was the Oster, but it did have some limitations that we were looking to correct. The BBCCX20 has 2 paddles, a better shape for the loaf, and the programmable feature is awesome. It seems to be built well. The bread pan is much easier to install and remove when the loaf is done. At double the cost of an Oster, for the features and durability, we are quite satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone who is in it for the long haul. We make our bread 2-3 times a week."
4,Great machine,"Biggest drawback is that a machine making rectangular loaves horizontally will take up more counter space than many other machines. However, we love it! I like that the bread comes out looking ""normal"" and the recipes we've tried so far have been really yummy. If it really does make jam well and if it holds up over time, it'll be worth every penny."
5,Excellent Zojirushi bread machine,"I love my Zojirushi BBCCX20. I have tried several bread machines and returned them to the store during the past several years. This bread machine is the best so far. It is very quiet. I usually make 100% Whole Wheat loaves(with 3 T. of gluten flour). This one does a great job. Consistent excellent quality.Not heavy,not moist or dry.I use my own recipe not the one listed in the recipe book however. I have also made cinnamon raisin bread and yeast doughs. I have made the applesauce cake too. Everything has turned out very well. The shape of the machine is convenient because it fits well under the counter even when the lid is open.A few things that would be nice to have as improvements would include an interior light (a flash light works well!)and a dispenser to add raisins etc when they need to be added to the dough. The machine beeps softly for 5 minutes when ingredients need to be added so unless you are asleep or away from the house you have lots of warning!"
5,Best bread machine we've ever bought!,"We received our machine on time and in perfect condition. We have made bread, cakes and jam using the recipes in the instruction book provided with the machine. We have no complaints and we would recommend this machine wholeheartedly to all. It is well worth the money and the ""regular"" loaves that it bakes are a sight to behold! Besides looking good, they smell good baking, they taste good and I would like to think that they are good for you! Since ""man cannot live on bread alone"" we are going to try the meat loaf recipe one of these days."
2,Still quality problems with pan,"When the pan in our last Zojirushi (the V20) gave out, we bought a whole new machine (this one), hoping they would have fixed the quality problems that haunted the old pans. Unfortunately, they did not. We used the machine maybe 1-2 times a month (sometimes more, sometimes less) for three and a half years, which means about 90 breads. The pan now is completely warped, it is leaking oil into the bread, and the paddles have completely scraped off the nonstick coating. A new pan with paddles is $80 with shipping. Ouch...The overall quality of the bread is not bad, but we actually had somewhat better results with the old one. The new machine has very uneven crust browning, and the loaf always comes out a bit lopsided."
5,Great Homebaked Bread!,"I am very pleased. The machine works beautifully, and is easily cleaned, a baker's dream. The directions are clear, and the options are many. If you can follow directions, you can make awesome bread. I have been baking bread for years, and this beats all my efforts. Everything is controlled. My family loves it!"
1,"Don't waste your time, money or ingredients!","If you have reached this page looking for a reference to the Zojirushi, here is my delima: I purchased this machine and wish I hadn't.It looks and seems like it would be a good purchase, but when I got it home and tried baking several loaves, they were hard as a rock and wouldn't release from the pan. I called the company and they sent me new blades. That helped with turning the loaves out, but they were not eatable. The crust was very hard and the bread was so terrible, I gave it to the birds. I kept calling the company and they finally said to contact the sender and get my money back....thank goodness, I returned it and by recommendation of one of the South Beach forums, was advised to purchase the Breadman Ultimate. I hope this saves whoever reads this some time and aggrivation! Happy Shopping!"
1,One Star is too high for this loser.,I have been using a bread machine for twelve years. (A Panasonic) Decided to try something different so I ordered the Zojirushi. The first machine did not cook the bread through and the crust was white so I sent it back and ordered another thinking I had just gotten a lemon. The second Zo had the same problem and I had to return it. I am going back to Panasonic which was a great bread machine. Good luck if you decide to try this loser.
3,Great performance,"We had a Breadman machine for 8+ years. Recently the pan started leaking water and we decided it was time to buy a new bread maker. We read the reviews and decided that the machine had excellant reviews. The first loaf of bread I made came out ok. I used a bread mix. The second time I tried it, I didn't get one of the paddles on correctly so it didn't mix the entire pan. The third time was the ""charm"". The bread was wonderful. I've used several of the recipes from the Zojirushi guide and have had great luck with all of them. This machine is amazingly quiet, especially compared to the old Breadman. I used to think that the old machine might jump off the counter when it was kneading. With the Zojirushi, I barely know it's on! I recommend this product to everyone."
5,A better bread maker,"We bake bread daily. The Zojirushi is our 6th machine. It does a better job than the others when they were new. We like the horizontal loaf and the double beaters. It seams to be more powerful. Before I purchased it I determined that they have a good parts department. I hope I will not need them soon, but I know the pan bearings and seals will not last forever. My suggestion is that this machine is well worth the additional money. I strongly discourage the compact machines, they are not worth the trouble."
1,Not too hot,"I baked six loaves in this machine. I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right. My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures. Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked. I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe. The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon. Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund."
4,For the Most Part - A Fabulous Investment,"I have always baked bread by hand and never owned a bread machine before this one. There are times when the loaf is lighter on top than I'd like. The bread does bake under the paddles but following the directions for cleaning and soaking a few moments seems to remedy for me. The paddles are a bit tricky to get off sometimes but nothing major. I've had no trouble with the non-stick surface as of yet. As to the browning of the bread - using this recipe I found online I get a great loaf every time. I add them in the order the manual says: 1 cup + 1 tbs. water, 1 large egg beaten, 4 1/2 tbs. vegetable oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tbs. rapid rise yeast. I use the quick cycle and the medium crust. Other recipes yield various results but this one is a staple in our house. Just my two cents worth, all in all I really like this machine for when I don't feel like making bread by hand."
2,Over rated,My wife states this bread maker is over rated and no better than the least expensive bread maker on the market.
1,Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine,"The Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine burns and dries out the bread. I wish I had not purchased this machine.The Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine was expensive compared to many others.I previously had a cheap Breadman bread machine that was much better.Sorry To Say,Hobson Parker"
1,bread very dry,"So far I am displeased with my breadmaker. I have not had time to play with the recipes, but the suggested white bread recipe was very dry (I weigh my flour). I also tried my tried and true buttermilk recipe and it was dry also. I have yet to play with the settings and maybe it will turn our OK. Possibly if I put the control on light crust, it will improve."
1,Useless manual & uneducated customer service!!,"I tried basic white bread recipe(4 cups flour and 1-1/2 cups water) which came with the machine about 10 times with little ingredients adjustments every time. It came out a very heavy thick loaf every time. I called a customer service and was told to cut bread flour a half and follow the recipe for the rests. I tried it, wasted all my time, and all the ingredients. Then I tried a recipe(3 cups flour and 1-1/4 cups water) of the ""Panasonic"" bread maker and could get a soft light loaf finally. Zojirushi's recipe is totally useless as well as the uneducated customer service. I don't believe this happens only to me. 4 cups flour and 1-1/2 cups water makes very dry dough obviously. I don't know why the other reviews were so good and Zojirushi didn't correct the recipe. This machine may be good as long as you don't follow their recommended recipe. Past 7 weeks our family ate very thick heavy toast every morning. I won't buy Zojirushi products any more."
2,a sad purchase for me,"i watched their video and read their manual with recipes, but i only get bread that tastes bad. i used to use old Hitachi bread maker, and i wish they still make bread makers. this zojirushi bread machine is a big disappointment, and it has been in my kitchen cabinet for over 3 months now. I am very sad."
1,Not for me.,"I found that this bread maker made a HUGE loaf. 2 lbs. is tremendous, and the 1 1/2 lb. loaf is big, too. I had trouble with the directions... not clear to me how to move the arrows around. Bread recipes weren't very original and it was difficult to adjust recipes to make a loaf smaller than 1 1/2 lbs. I exchanged this bread maker for a Zogirushi that makes a l lb. loaf... hopefully, this will work better for me."
1,Very disappointed,"I am happy that all of you did well with your Zojirushi. I have thrown mine in the garbage. After 20 tries, and much frustration, I have had it. I kept giving it more chances, but nothing came out. I'll just go back to my Breadman."
1,Machine does not meet my expectations. Very dissatisfied,"I have used various settings and recipes and have yet to bake a good loaf of bread. The loaf is misshaped, part of crust looks like it is unbaked, the crust color is not a choice selection for whole wheat bread as advertized. The texture of the bread is uneven. I used another brand of bread maker for 19 years and always made a perfect loaf.Vronna Endahl, Home Economics graduate and retired Home Economics teacher."
3,Inflexible,"I'm not entirely pleased after using the Zojlrushi X20 for several weeks. It tends to overcook the bottom crust on my favorite whole wheat bread recipe; I think the temperature is too high. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to allow you to change the temperature. One reviewer said that she called the company about this and they told her to reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe. I really don't want to change the ingredients in the recipe to make up for the bread machine's overly high temperature.The bread is not quite as good as when I used to make it with my old Welbilt ""R2D2"" model. I used the dough cycle and then baked it in the oven. I bought this machine so I would have rectangular loaves without having to bake the dough separately."
1,I'm so frustrated!,"I can't believe all the glowing reports I've read about the Zojirushi breadmaker model BBCC-V20. I have yet to make a good loaf of bread. Today I tried using an expensive mix from the store where we bought the machine. It is a flop! I do like using it for mixing and rising and then removing the dough to finish the bread outside the machine. My husband has talked with the sales rep, but her suggestions have not helped."
4,Bread Machine,"It worked great, due to the hot weather, I put it on the deck and had a great loaf of fresh bread."
2,Expensive Dud,"I have been using bread machines for over 15 years. I am such a fan of bread machines that as each of my 3 children left for college, a bread machine was always sent with them.Needless to say, when I was in the market for a new machine I was excited about getting a Zo. That thrill didn't last long. I have yet to turn out a nice loaf of bread from this machine. The loaves never brown on top and usually lopsided. The loaves are hard to get out of the pan. The 2 mixing blades make large holes in the bottom of the loaf.I would never recommend this bread machine - save your money, buy something else."
3,Good Bread Machine,"This was a good bread machine, but horrible for the waistline. Used it for a year or so and then sold it on Craigslist. It went very quickly (everybody seems to love Zojirushi products on Craigslist)."
2,Very disappointing experience,"After a very good experience with a Breadman model I decided to upgrade to this Zojirushi breadmaker. I liked the idea of making more traditionally shaped loaves and thought it would be worth the money since I use my Breadman so frequently. What a disappointment. The dough is not even. I need to reach in to reshape the loaf over both paddles. When I add raisins, nuts, etc. They don't incorporate into the dough evenly. I need to pull the dough out and manually add these items. Even a simple white bread recipe is disappointing because the loaf is not evenly shaped.I would not recommend this. My hope is that the Breadman brand will come out with a traditionally shaped loaf bread maker. Sorry.... save your money."
2,Not worth the price,"This is my third bread machine and the most expensive one we have purchased. It is definitely not worth the price. I have had to throw out several batches of wheat bread since the motor isn't strong enough to knead the dough, even on a wheat setting. A regular loaf of bread isn't as tasty as others we have had. I am very disappointed in the machine."
5,Zo's Breadmaker,We purchased the small 1lb.Zo breadmaker about 20 years ago. The only reason we are buying a new one is that they don't make the part any more that we need. Would I ever consider buying any other breadmaker after such longevity? NEVER!JM
4,Zojirushi Bread Maker,"We have been using another bread maker for well over 10 years and have been familiar with the process. After some early failures with several loaves, we discovered that the flour was the culprit. They now date all flour packages. We also found that contrary to what the video said, regular all purpose flour has work better than the specialized Bread Flour.All in all, an excellent machine. Amazon.com delivered quickly."
4,GREAT Bread!,"We really love this machine. It does a great job kneading the dough. We also like the ""add"" feature and are experimenting with different things like sunflower seeds, etc. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the crust can get a little hard when the bread is cooked in the machine. We have now started preparing the bread in the machine and then placing in oven bread pans to rise and cook."
4,Zojirushi Bread Machine,"For the most part, we really like the bread maker. A few times it didn't mix to well (one end did better than the other), so one end raised better. Otherwise it's a great machine."
3,Zojirushi Supreme Bread Maker,"I have used this bread maker now for a lot of different recipes. If I used a recipe from a different bread maker book, the loaf did not turn out. The recipes from Zojirushi's book have turned out and the loaves are tasty and texture is good. The machine is loud when kneading. Overall, for the price you pay for this machine, I have gotten just as good of bread from other machines I have had in the past."
4,"Great bread, not so good timer","I bought this to replace a 12 year old Zojirushi that developed leaks in the bread-pan. I like the horizontal loaf and the bread quality is excellent; however, the delay timer is not as good as the old one. The old Zojirushi had a clock and to delay you merely set the time that you wanted the bread to be finished. The new one has no clock, you have to set the hours of delay you want. Other than that it seems to be an excellent bread machine."
1,What a disappointment,"I have gone through 2 William Sonoma (Breadman) machines which I loved but decided to move up to the Zo based on all of the King Arthur hype. So far, I have had it for about 6 months and continue to be disappointed with the machine. It is fine for kneading but when it comes to baking the dough doesn't rise enough, the bottom is overcrisped and the top looks anemic. All of my tried and try recipes from Laura Brody's and Beth Hesperger's books don't work like they used to."
5,The BEST,I am on a Gluten Free diet. this is the only bread machine I have found that can hold up to all the thicker bread recipes that are for gluten free..This machine works fantastic..It is the only one to use
4,Zojirushi Breadmachine,"Overall OK.Initially had a difficult time with making a good bread.My old Breadman made a better bread, but the seal on the pan went bad.Using the manufacture's recommanded recipe for white bread resulted in too dense bread.After making some adjustment, it is coming out OK.Here is what ended up working:Water - 1.5 cup plus 2 tbsp (160cc)Flour - 4 1/4 cupSugar - 3 tbspDry Milk - 2 tbspSalt - 1 1/2 tspButter - 2 tbspYeast - 2 tsp plus 1/2 tsp(""Plus"" is where I made adjustments)Good luck."
1,Nearly started a fire,"This machine worked FABULOUSLY for a year then began smoking and would have started a fire if I hadn't spotted it. Apparently the pan cracked and leaked. The maker said it would cost $55 to mail it in and there was no guarantee it could be fixed and, if it could, could be more than $100 for repair and then another $55 to mail it back.When I objected, the man said, ""Well, it's a consumer problem now.""I hate to be ""un-green,"" but I simply got rid of it."
4,Very good machine,"We recently purchased this bread machine after having gone through two other brands. The last one committed suicide by walking off the counter while mixing bread for Easter dinner! We are very pleased so far with the Zojirushi BBCCX20 Bread Machine. The bread has been delicious, and it seems to be much quieter than the late West Bend. It does seem that it sometimes doesn't mix the dough completely, but this can be corrected by making sure that all the dry ingredients are scraped off the side during the first mixing. Overall, though, it is the best bread machine we have owned."
4,nice bread machine,I bake bread every other day and this is a consistent bread machine. Love the horizontel loaves! Only small issue is sometimes the bread gets stuck to the rotors on the bottom.
4,MAKES YUMMY BREAD,"The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is that the first few loaves' crusts turned out much darker on the sides and barely browned on the top. I called the manufacturer about it and they offered to ship it back to them to test it. I opted not to do this. Instead, I tried out a few more loaves and it seems fine since I started using the light crust setting, then leaving the loaf in the machine after it is finished baking for about 20 minutes. Customer service rep suggested this. They were very friendly and helpful. I've made about 12 loaves so far. White and cinnamon raisin are the best! A great product....much better quality than the last bread machine I had from 14 years ago."
2,"solidly built machine, bad bread","This is the most solidly built bread machine I have ever encountered, looked like it would last for years and years. Unfortunately, the bread it produced was of poor quality. I've been using bread machines since they first showed up in specialty catalogues. In fact I never buy bread, my kids will only eat the homemade stuff. I tried all sorts of recipes, both those included with the machine as well as some of my tried and true ones, nothing I tried gave me bread my kids would eat. Crust quality and texture were consistently poor."
2,Problems Baking and Paddles Flaking,"We purchased our Zojirushi 2-pound Bread Machine from Amazon in April 2011, a little over 1 1/2 years ago.For reference, we have been baking bread at least weekly since the 1970s. We grew up on the Tassajara Bread Book and still make a more complex version of their standard recipe.Pros:- quiet- mixes and rises extremely well- cooks the sides and bottom of a loaf very nicely - crunchy, solid sides and bottom almost as if cooked in an ovenCons- does not cook the top of a loaf. After several attempts, I called customer service and, after sending a photo, was told my under-cooked top was ""normal"". When I make a complex, multi-grain recipe, the upper portion of the loaf was undercooked, almost raw.- the ""paddles"" that mix and knead the loaf have a non-stick coating that is now peeling off into my bread. Calling customer service, I was told to order another set of paddles from the Zojirushi website for $16.Lee"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the Zoji in 2008. At first, it made good bread. However, after owning it for 6 months, it stopped baking bread correctly. The loaves that would result from the machine were burnt bricks that didn't rise, no matter how I tweaked the settings and changed the ingredients to be sure it wasn't me or anything I was using.I was so disappointed in this machine as I thought it would be superior - two paddles, all kinds of customization options... but none of them worked. The paddles started going wonky on me when I was making dough after the bread baking option crapped out. I Freecycled this unit and won't be buying another one.A shame, really - my best friend had one and she loved it, never had a problem with it. I think that they must not have a consistent production process or parts are faulty as another poster said.I would not buy another one. I had a Breadman before this and was able to use it for about 6 years before it died."
5,daughter's gift,"My daughter had a second hand magic chef 1 lb loaf bread maker. It was adequate, but she was baking everyday. There are five people in her family. When I got her this for mother's day she was estatic. She loves that it makes a 2 lb loaf and the bread taste great. I would definitely recommend it."
4,very good,made several loaves so far and it works exactly as promised. clean up is simple and recipes included are easy to follow. fresh bread tastes great without the preservatives in grocery store bread. we've also made banana bread using the cake setting.
3,The joy of Zojirushi,"I used an Oster bread maker for years. It eventually stopped working and we purchased the Zojirushi since it was the highest rated and had horizontal loaves. I have been severely disappointed in the performance of this machine. I have tried several recipes and have found that except for one lucky loaf, the machine does not adequately mix the dough, and the loaf is horribly misshapen after it rises. I got better performance from a much less expensive machine, and I regret paying the premium dollars for a machine that does not perform well at all."
3,Bread Machine,Makes bread on the heavy side. Have to keep adjusting flour and water to get a good loaf of bread.
3,Zo X20 Bread Machine,"Nice dough mixer, but the full cycle bread is under cooked, have to stick it in the oven to finish it. However am on a learning curve, advised to use less flour. I have noticed that the bread gets moldy after a few days, so ""use it or lose it"" and or stick it in the freezer.UPDATE: 10/08 Still not a good bread baker, I use it on ""dough"" cycle very good results. For a nice quick loaf the one lb. Mini is my choice."
5,Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine,I purchased my Bread Machine in December and have made several loaves of bread and they were all just perfect. My Husband is also delighted with the results. Thanks for an excellent Bread Machine.
1,Don't waste your money,"This machine has been a huge disappointment. We get an edible loaf once every three or four tries, for no discernible reason. Often, the bread doesn't rise, or doesn't mix. The customer service person said this was because I scooped flour, rather than measured by spoon into the measuring cup. That explanation doesn't fly, in my opinion, since I measured the same way with our old breadmaker (Regal) and had great bread all the time.Also, you can't use the timer function for the ""quick"" setting (which is appropriate for the Fleischman's Rapid Rise Yeast). I wish I had known this before buying. The recipes are not at all exciting and the format of the manual/recipes is not very user-friendly.Overall, this breadmaker is very finicky and not at all worth this price. I wish my old one still worked."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I see this machine as great as a dishwasher or washer and dryer. should be a must own appliance. I save hordes of money using this thing. It is so reliable and easy to use. I bought mine in November of 2008 and I have probably purchased store bought bread about 10-15 times since.the only improvement I could suggest for the company that makes it would be to create a non stick coating for the shafts on which the stirring paddles attach. Not hard to clean as is, it would just be an improvement and be easier to clean.If you are looking for a bread machine, go ahead look around. this is the best. I have probably used this machine on average twice a week for about two and half years. And thats not including the times my wife and I use it to make pizza dough!"
2,Disappointed...,"I Bought This Bread Machine Because It Was Rated As One Of The Finest. I Have Attempted Approximately 6 Loafs And 2 Have Been Successful. I Follow The Recipes To A Tee And Measure All Ingredients Accurately. For The Price Of Over $200.00 I Expected More. I Picked Up A West Bend Breadmaker With A Recipe Book At A Garage Sale For $2.99, It Has More Features, As An Example It Has An Extended Rise Cycle And A Light To View The Bread, I'm Sure The Orginal Price Was Not Even Close To The Zojirushi's Cost."
2,Two paddles a mistake,"We bought this machine because of it's size -- it would fit in our appliance garage. However, in order for it to be narrow, the loaf pan is elongated, and hence there are two paddles instead of one. This results in poor kneading, because the dough gets repeatedly torn, tearing up the gluten strands as they're forming (at least this is my conjecture). It works OK if you make a large amount of dough, but you can't make a small loaf or a smallish amount of pizza dough. I have not tried baking in the machine, but I doubt this would work well either, because when I lift the lid to get the dough after the first rise, it's usually lopsided. It's very expensive too! The one I had before that was only about $50 and did a fine job. That one, however, started ""schooching"" on the counter while kneading and finally smashed to the floor. I have not had good luck with bread machines. A caveat: I bake all the bread for the family, so it gets used 3-4 times a week."
5,Zo Bread Machine,"The transaction and product was great. It arrived with all parts and instructions, well packaged, and ready to go. Would do business again."
2,Poor Bread Quality,"I've been baking homemade bread for over 15 years. Have just recently turned to bread machines. I went through two Breadman machines in the past 18 months. While the Breadman's produced very good bread they were poorly designed from a mechanical perspective...kept breaking down.So I thought I would ""splurge"" and get the Zojirushi BBCCX20. What a mistake!The Zojirushi is well designed mechanically...very sturdy. But in over 20 attempts, trying various Zojirushi and other recipes, I cannot produce what I consider a good loaf of bread.I will probably go back to making bread by hand."
3,It's Ok but....,"I have made several loafs of bread using this machine. I am not pleased with the crust on this bread. The top is jagged and uneven and the sides are hard. It creates a ""hard"" shell but the inside is soft. So if you want to cut the crust off then you will have a perfect loaf of bread."
3,Low baking temperature 290 F,I have bought the Zojirushi BBCCX20 as a replacement for the Breadman TR2200C Ultimate which I gave away.Pros:1. Double kneading. Mixes even the rye dough well. Better than the Breadman in this.2. The kneading paddles come out of the crust without making a hole as it happened with my Breadman.3. Rectangular pan. Although not that rectangular as I expected :)Cons:1. Major issue: Low baking temperature: Max is 290 Fahrenheits (confirmed with the customer service) This is too low for the baking. The bread's top is slightly undercooked on the dark crust setting and flattens out. Compare to Breadman that bakes at 330 F in the basic mode and up to 355 F on the custom setting. My breads from the Breadman machine were perfectly cooked. The maximum baking time of the BBCCX20 is 110 minutes.I'll keep it for I can bear slightly undercooked breads and need double kneading.A Tip: Use the Dark crust setting and let the the bread to sit on a rack for at least 12 hours.
3,Seems unable to handle 100% whole wheat,"This is probably a great machine for bread recipes that use at least 50% white flour. However, we obtained mediocre results with 100% whole wheat recipes. The loaves were misshapen, and when we attempted to use the timer to have bread ready in the morning, the paddles apparently were unable to mix the ingredients after they had been sitting in the pan for five hours. We returned the unit. Perhaps this particular unit was defective, or perhaps we were inadvertently failing to follow the instructions, but we are going to go back to making bread by hand."
3,so so results,"So, far we've used the bread machine several times with very inconsistent results. The breads have not risen well so most of them look kind of funky. We liked one of the cakes the best although it tasted more like bread. We'll keep using it until we get it right!"
5,zojirushi bread machin,"I have had 3 bread machines before this one. I make nearly all the bread we eat. Wore the others out, way too quickly. Broke down and bought the best I could afford--what a difference! Love it. I usually bake bread in the oven so the loaf pan is not the most important thing to me. But the kneading with the twin blades is wonderful. I live in Fl. so i have to add flour sometiemes--much more humid here--and the machine is easy to do this with."
4,A Fine Bread Machine,This machine works quite nicely. To get the exact texture of the bread using their recipies you might want to experiment with some of the ingredients. If you use the dough making feature any personl recipies work quite well. Just remember that the water goes in first - the machine preheats it in their baking process.Good Luck to All.
1,Didn't Last Long...Poor Customer Service,"The machine worked fairly well for about 4 months and then started to decline. Now, the dough does not form correctly and the paddles do not mix it well at all. I don't understand why so many positive reviews on this product. I will never buy another! Customer support was a joke. They had me do this test by rotating the paddles until I felt resistence...which I never did so I assume it failed. Even after failing THEIR test, the rep told me I must be making the bread wrong and that I need to get a scale to weigh the flour because the machine is so touchy. Well that's rediculous, why did it work before using same recipe?Obviously Zojirushi does not stand behind their products and I will never buy any from this company again. I wish I could attach the picture of the bread this machine made. It is NOT GOOD...Do not waste your time or money."
1,don't waste your money,"Got the breadmaker for christmas, after spending 45 min. to add all the ingreadents together and then waiting another 4 hrs to bake the bread came out like a log. I went out and bought all new ingreadents and tryed again,still the bread was not good. Will try to return it. My old breadmaker worked great and was a LOT cheaper."
5,Use it all the time!,"What a great machine! I could not be more pleased! We have three young kids and we do not buy bread any more. So good to know I am feeding my kids preservative free bread and can choose the flour we use, whole wheat, unbleached, white. Whatever we are in the mood for. This is my first experience with a breadmaker. It is so easy to learn to use, the care is simple, I like the programming options. I can set it to make bread over night. I can also program my own cycles if I want to. This machine is so well designed, just a quality product. We make pizza dough in it now and the taste is fantastic! I will never again buy greasy pizza and feed it to my kids. They top the dough with whatever they prefer, how much of a certain topping they like, and they are having fun eating healthy! Thin crust, thick crust. Just depends on our mood!"
4,Breadmaker Supreme,"I have only used it three times so far, but it makes very good bread, even distribution of ingredients throughout loaf. The timer is easy to set and I do not find it to be excessively noisy. I like the shape of the loaf rather than the odd shapes produced by other bread makers, however the unit is quite large on my counter. I am looking forward to trying other recipes as well since it is very versatile and makes more than just bread, ie cakes, meatloaf and jams."
2,flat bread!,"I was so excited to get this! However, after multiple recipes and several brands of yeast It has never produced a ""beautiful"" loaf of bread. Doesn't seem to do the job of kneading very well. I can get better results from my KitchenAid dough hook! All loaves had very little rise and looked terrible. I have made dozens of loaves of bread over the years the old fashioned way, so I know what results I am looking for and this doesn't get the job done for me!."
1,Zojirushi Junk,Don't buy a Zojirushi bread machine. I have an earlier model Zojirushi and no matter what I try I cannot get a decent loaf of bread. The bread always falls and turns into a door stop. I have contacted Zojirushi and they are no help. I had a much cheaper bread machine prior to this one which turned out great bread. You would think for the high price of the Zojirushi it would turn out the best bread but just the opposite has been my experience. I did not buy my machine from Amazon or I probably could have gotten a refund. Zojirushi does not want to talk about refunds. Do not buy Zojirushi!
2,Disappointing,"When I first got the Zo 6 months ago, I thought, ""This is the most impressive bread maker ever conceived by man. Oh, the possibilities...the flexibility...fully programmable...oooh."" I can tell you now, after going through the entire Zo experience, from honeymoon to divorce, save your money. The Zo doesn't do anything any better than machines costing well under $100, and some things, like baking, it doesn't do nearly as well. I'm going with the $60 Sunbeam 5891."
1,Same problems as the V20,"The pan is ""CHEAP"". That is, the non-stick stuff comes off. This means, at the very least, that your bread sticks to the pan. On the serious side, this stuff is in your bread and who knows the potential health effects of consuming it. With the increasing incidence of many health problems including cancers, tumors, Altzheimer's, childhood diseases, who can say for sure that it's not caused by something as all-pervasive and seemingly benign as our cookware? What about cookware that contributes little metal particles to your recipe?I haven't seen it warp yet but the V20 pan warped and I suspect that this one will warp as well over time (why wouldn't it, it's the SAME pan).Summary: I've stopped using it and sold it at a yard sale. Will purchase something different."
2,"Don't buy this from Amazon, use another merchant!!!",Amazon shipped this breadmaker without a shipping box ... and of course it arrived via UPS with a very bad 3 inch dent on the side.If you have this breadmaker you know that the metal is very sturdy but UPS specs on proper packing material just WAS NOT MET. The Japanese are very demanding about quality and this is an awesome product. Amazon needs to get its act together and spend a couple bucks on a box when shipping a 200$ item.I have the previous version of this breadmaker that I got back in 1998. The product box arrived in its shelf box inside a separate shipping box with peanuts. The box the breadmaker comes in is for retail selling and not UPS shipping.Amazon super-saver shipping ... worth every penny!!!!!
1,Worst Breadmachine I've Ever Had,"A couple of years ago I purchased the Zoji BBCCX20 because it appeared to be highly rated. It was the worst breadmachine I ever purchased and a waste of money. The loaves come out uneven, higher on one end than the other, and the top of the crust is lighter and thiner than the sides and bottom. I only use this machine for making dough, then, I finish the bread in the oven.I've written the company a couple of times and received some general information on what to change but nothing I do seems to produce a good quality loaf of bread. Did I just get a bad machine? Maybe, but I'm certainly not going to spend the money to get another Zoji to see if a new one would be any better. I have a little machine that I bought years ago at Williams & Sonoma that makes much better bread than the Zoji."
4,LIke the machine but have a question,Sorry to the person I commented to I meant to post a review....so here is the review:I too received this machine for Christmas. I have tried twice to make whole wheat bread using the recipe in the book but it did not come out either time. Can anyone provide some help with that?Other than this small problem I love the machine and use it at least twice a week.
3,Best Price at Amazon!,"I've made three loaves of bread (white from the included recipes) and each one has turned out differently. The 1st was perfect. I was really pleased to see that the mixing paddles did not stick to the bread and only made small holes in the loaf. The second loaf barely mixed, so I took it out and made a freeform loaf. The third time was much better, but the paddles stuck and made large holes in the bread. Also, some batter managed to slip under the properly seated paddles - Very hard to wash off, even after soaking.Over all, I do like it, but guess I expected more from a pricey machine."
4,Only one complaint,"This is a great machine and makes dream loaves, but not without a little help. I've found that because of the dual blades the dough often is not distributed evenly in the pan when baking begins and the loaves come out uneven and too crusty on the top. This is solved by taking the dough out after the last kneading process, making an oblong but even ball out of it and then putting it back in to rise evenly. This creates an awesome loaf after baking."
4,Reliable performer,"I have been making bread with this machine week in and week out for about five years now. Our daily bread is whole wheat, but I have made many other kinds. I only buy artisan type breads at the grocery store. Overall, I am very satisfied with this machine. Here are the accomodations I make: (1) when the beeper goes off, I pat the top of the dough down into a nice loaf shape, so it will be good for sandwiches; (2) when adding dried fruit or nuts, I actually remove the dough from the machine after the beeps and smush them into the dough before putting the dough back in, because the machine sometimes can't manage the job. I don' t mind doing that, it's no big deal to me. We don't care to eat supermarket bread any more, it's just not satisfying."
5,ZOJIRUSHI BREAD MACHINE,THIS BREAD MACHINE IS AWESOME!!!!!! JUST SET IT AND FORGET IT. IT IS A VERY SMART MACHINE. EASY TO CLEAN AND PROGRAM. CHOSE THIS MACHINE TO USE FOR GLUTEN FREE BREAD AND WORKS GREAT. ANNALISE ROBERTS BOOK FOR BREAD MACHINE IS DESIGNED FOR THIS MACHINE WITH STEP BY STEP FOR PROGRAMMING INFO. EXCELLENT MACHINE!!!!!
5,Works every time!,I had a Cuisinart and it was kinda fussy. I got sick of having to try 3 times before getting a perfect loaf. This machine is idiot proof. Easy directions. The two paddles make a huge difference as well. One paddle is not enough to pull dough from the sides of the pan. It costs more but it is worth it!
3,Not all I hoped for in an expensive product.,"While I am not completely unsatisfied with this product, I had hoped for better performance. The first one shipped was defective and had to return for a replacement. Basic problem is difficulty with small loaves. There's just the two of us so we prefer to make frequent small loaves rather than larger ones. The unit has trouble kneading the small loaves and the denser the mixture, the more difficulty."
2,Machine not usable: arrived without paddles,"This item arrived without the necessary paddles, so we've been unable to use it and we're having to hunt around and order the paddles elsewhere. I e-mailed Amazon and got an apologetic return email, but at least a month has passed and no paddles have arrived. I generally find Amazon to be quite trustworthy but this is a disappointment and I will think twice before ordering small appliances from Amazon in the future."
3,mine broke,"This is an expensive machine, so you want it to last awhile, which mine did not. One of the kneaders stopped working, so the ingredients would just sit there while the machine made its usual noises. It took me awhile to figure out that a piece of metal had broken off inside so the pan was not being held in place correctly. I would not buy this machine again."
3,"Good for kids, but has a lack of text for adults.","This book is a good one for children, with many pictures, but dosnt always stay focused on the building. It lacks text that would be of interest to adults."
4,A Product of It's Time,"God, I really hated this group first time I heard them.Some druggie cover of a Stones song.Grew up ,heard jazz & fully expanded my rock horizons,appreciated harmony & remembered that Stones tune.This album reminds me of""What's Going On"" by Marvin in scope & prodution.Funny how ""last call for peace "" still rings true.WAR IS OVER[if you want it]A great re-issue on One Way...... it's got soul ,rock,hendrix guitar,social concerns,Santa on some 1960's additives and Peace & Love.......How can you go wrong?I'd give this album 5 stars but only listen to it at the holidays.many times over."
4,Rotary connection Peace,I guess you could this a xmas album but its not the usual stuff. Its like santa on acid. Tou have to open minded to get it. once you do its fun.
4,Good VHS,"Purchased two of these hunting for a good quality tape that would last for repeated taping. Seems to be good quality in comparison to previously using RCA, Maxell and Magnavox brands. Unfortunately, after purchasing these, I found the same tapes in a store for a little less, but no big deal."
3,A useful reference,"Wasfi Youssef does know much about the legal aspects, the municipal restrictions, the building codes, and contractor & inspector practices in use. This alone may make his text highly useful for the neophyte builder, or the husband & wife turned general contractor. Wasfi Youssef does cover the legal site-prep matters very well, but his text is sorely in need of better detail on the nuts and bolts of home building. He covers the ""pen, paper, and permit"" aspects very well, but the ""hammer, chisel, nail, and stud"" parts are inadequate. From reading his book, it should be more appropriately titled, ""How to Contract the Building of Your Own Home"". I have my doubts that Mr. Youssef actually built it any part of his home with his own hands, and he may have relied on contractor tradesman for the ""nuts and bolts"" of it."
1,A Vague Summary of Home Building Issues,"This book is way too vague to be useful to someone actually trying to build a home. There's far too little detail on anything useful. For example, there are three pages on plumbing, two pages on electrical wiring. You can imagine how helpful this is going to be someone bold enough to set off in charge of a building project."
3,Basic legal information is strongpoint,"One of many books written by people who share their experiences building a home. In this case, it's a civil engineer who has thoroughly researched the legal and financial issues. The rest is a cursory overview of the building process, with a few self-drawn illustrations. Very readable text with a rare explanation of differing regional methods of surveying land."
1,not for the do it yourself'er,"for the person who wants to hire a contracter and just over see the process, not for the do it yourself'er"
3,Oak Table Set,"I was somewhat disappointed. First, the shipment promised was delayed by more than a week; then when it arrived, it was in one box (all four chairs and table)completely broken down, so that we had to hire a handyman to put it together. There were NO instructions in the box and the chairs did not have the brace shown on the photo. The table was fine; however, we had to have the handyman return to glue the slats in the chair backs another time as insufficient glue was included. I probably would have been better off purchasing this set or similar locally; between the cost of the items online, shipping, and the cost of the labor to complete it, it was not worth it."
1,Disappointed Family - WORMS in wood,"06/25/11 bought on line, 07/09/11 as we put together the last chair we found WORMS IN THE CHAIR HOOP! Immediately emailed MOSHYA HOME FURNISHINGS. They replied with 10% off. We rejected, everything else was all put together! 07/11/11 They asked for photos, we sent them immediately. 07/15/11 They sent message they would send tracking # the next day as the item was on back order. 08/11/11 said was still on back order, for me to be assured it was ordered and paid for !!! 09/16/11, I sent email, no response. Called Co phone #, voice box full. 10/14/11 called Co, message box still full and no response from Co since 08/11/11 We presently have our table and 3 chairs and 1 stool as we are a family of 4. If they ever abide by their written response I will advise this referral."
4,nice indeed,Very sturdy and heavy table. It enhances my entire kitchen and looks so pretty! Pleased with product. Great delivery as usual with them. I saw a similar table at another store for twice as much. Very nice indeed.
4,Not too shabby,"I'm very happy with the table and chairs and consider myself picky. There were a couple dings, some minor blemishes, etc...but nothing worth getting worked up over and I probably could have contacted customer service for replacement parts. All and all, a very good deal and this was exactly what I wanted. Solid hardwood throughout and very sturdy.As for putting it all together...if you haven't done a project before you probably don't want to start with this table set. There's nothing complicated, but you will need to lay out your parts and think things through before getting started. The manufacturer does an excellent job making sure everything fits and I didn't need a mallet or extra glue. Everything you need is included. It's just time consuming and you will definitely be glad when it's over.Also, it shipped right away and was delivered on time. I would have rated the table five stars, but the dings (which clearly came from the manufacturer) cost them a star. ;-)"
1,Chairs and Table,The chairs were awful to put together. I was not happy with the end product of the chairs. We could not get the arrowbacks to the chairs to fit in the chair snug. The rods kept falling out. We ended up having to use superglue to have them not move. Also the directions were not very clear.I would recommend to not get this table.
4,"Excellent, peaceful and not distracting","I teach meditation and have used this CD in my workshops. Although it contains music, it is relaxing and the melody is not distracting. It is very gentle, peaceful and a good resource for relaxation.While there are claims that it affects brainwaves in certain ways, I can't attest to that. However, I personally find it relaxing and have enjoye using it. That has been my experience of the students in my workshops as well."
1,"Region 2 not ""clear"" - this is PAL ONLY format for Europe...","After receiving what I thought would be a *great* deal -I found that ""[Region 2]"" means PAL format DVD which is for European use only. At least Now I Know what [Region 2] means.This European PAL DVD was advertised and shipped *within the US* - why even make it available here?Waste of time...Bing"
5,Hunt and purchase,I was so happy to get the additional hand controls for our TV Trivia Game. You have the ordering and purchaseing so easy and the dellivery is so fast. Thanks
4,Good but a bit biased,"Very well written, with lots of good reference material. Though I share the authors opposition to the Vietnam War I think she turns a blind eye to some of the atrocities committed by VC and NVA. All in all a good book."
3,Needs to be secured,"I have a 5 pound dwarf rabbit, and he wouldn't go into the tunnel because it isn't secured to the floor (it rolls all over the place). So, I had to improvise with velcro stickers and I stick it to the tile. If you put treats in the tunnel it helps the rabbit associate the tunnel as a good thing. Beats tunneling behind book shelves!"
4,Super Tunnel,"This super tunnel is nice. I bought it for my two guinea pigs and they love it. They run in it and the noise doesn't bother me, as long as they're happy. It's easy to put up and easy to wash. It's not the same color as in the picture. When I got mine, it was red. Hey no problem. It's pretty long, and my guinea pigs enjoys it."
4,Guinea Pig,"I bought this for my two month old guinea pig. I have blocked all the hard to access dark areas she loves to hide in, so I needed an easy to access toy that she felt comfortable in (they like dark areas). The crinkle tunnel allows me to know that she is inside since there is a hole in the middle. The color is just as shown and it is not too loud when she runs in and out of the tunnel. She is not the biggest fan, but it allows her to feel safe in open areas I let her run around. I would buy this for my guinea pig again knowing that since I just got her she is still getting used to the environment."
3,Not for lop bunnies!,"This is cute, but read the description carefully - it states ""for dwarf rabbits"". Look at your hands and make a circle, touching right thumb to left thumb and right forefinger to left forefinger. If you think your pet can pass through that, you might consider buying this tunnel - unless you have exceptionally large hands. If you do have large hands, take a tape measure to the widest part of your pet and that should help you decided.I suggestCRACKLECHUTEor maybeABO Gear Fun Run Tunnel for Cats and Small Animalsfor a rabbit too large to fit in this tunnel."
5,Guinea pig likes it,I didn't think my guinea pig would like this because of the crinkle noise but I liked the look of it so decided to give it a try. My guinea pig loves it! He prefers this to his igloo now. He spends his hiding time in the crinkle tunnel and now uses his igloo as his bathroom. I like that it has a circle opening/hole in the middle so I can easily see if my piggy is in the tunnel.
4,tunnel,"Tunnel is nice but really small, guinea pig sized. Dwarf rabbit does not like it, wont go in it yet"
2,Not as expected,"I ordered the super pet crinkle tunnel labeled as LARGE, and was shocked when it arrived to discover that it's very tiny. It states that it is for rabbits but no bunny over 4 weeks old would fit in this tunnel. It was so small. I have to return it and look for something that can accommodate a average size rabbit of 6 lbs or more."
1,WAY TOO SMALL,I have baby rabbits and they can't even fit in this. I have no idea how any rabbit could get into this tunnel. May be better for small guinea pigs.
2,Very Small,"I have two 6 week old bunnies and this is the perfect size for them. The problem is that I expected it to be twice the size it is, so they can use it when they're adults ( 3-4 lbs ). They probably will only be able to use it for another month or two until they out grow it."
1,much different than pictured,This is for small animals. We got this for our 4 month old kitten and it is way too small.
2,Only For Tiny Bunnies!,"I saw the rave reviews from other rabbit owners and thought I would give this a try. I have two very young Holland Lops and figured even if they did outgrow it they would get some fun out of it for a while. They are 10 weeks old right now and weight just over 2 pounds. Some of the reviewers have said that their 4 pound buns are able to go in. Maybe my 2 pound buns are just too fluffy or we haven't tried hard enough but the first words out of my mouth when I opened it were ""They're not going to fit"". They probably CAN fit in it right now but I think that they are a bit freaked out because it seems like such a small space so they are hesitant to want to try. So buyer beware...this is probably great for cavies (guinea pigs) or small bunnies but your bun may soon outgrow it or be afraid to go into something so small. If they change their mind and fall in love with the thing I will update my review!"
2,"If you have an average size rabbit, this will be too small","The advertised picture is misleading, I have two average sized lionhead rabbits and they have to squirm like worms to get through this tunnel. For ferrets, guiny pigs, and hamsters it will do just fine. I think this would be too small for dwarf rabbits too. It does crinkle and scrunch up nicely for storage. If it was larger, I would give it 5 stars but I cannot use it as it is."
2,Too Small For Use With Rabbits,"The photo shows a bunny playing in this tunnel, but it is WAY too small for animals bigger than a guinea pig."
3,A review for ferret owners looking to buy this product,"The product is fun and as described. I bought it with hesitation though; my two ferrets will play with boxes and egg cartons and snub their nose at expensive store-bought toys. I thought I would give the crinkle tunnel a try but I would not buy it again for my duo. The product itself was fine, but my ferrets did only two things with it; sleep in it and tear it to pieces. The middle layer is plastic (akin to saran wrap)and I was afraid they would eat it or choke on it, so I ended up tossing the tunnel soon after I'd bought it. This product didn't work out for my pets, but that does not mean that it won't work for yours. Use discretion."
3,Meh,"At first my bunnies didn't quite know what to make of this, but once I started bribing them with treats, they started going through the tunnel. Now they only go through when they think they're going to get rewarded, and the rest of the time it just sits, unused."
5,great for chinnie,"a little disappointed as mine was the ugly brown plain one and not cute like the one pictured but it is light weight, easy to pack AND clean, and chinnie loves playing in it!!!"
5,"TAKE A CHANCE ON ""THE LAST CHANCE""!!",This is a very well written story that takes the characters and the readers on an exciting journey. This book will hold the interest of teenagers AND adults and you don't have to be an avid fan of sci-fi/fantasy to appreciate the plot. (I am certainly proof of this!) James Gauthier and Ed Martin have produced a tale that is definitely worth reading and I am already looking forward to the next installment!
5,A Little Powerhouse of a Book,"Don't allow your plans for a juicy, psychological thriller to be foiled by the smallness of this book. In just 136 pages, Dasha Kelly introduces us to a character of whom the sharpest James Patterson villian would be proud.Emorie and James have a strong marriage that is threatened when Emorie's good friend Denise alludes to having an affair with James. Emorie is thrown for a loop by this revelation and then sets out determined to find out what the hell has transpired between her husband and her best friend.Don't let my synopsis fool you, though. This is no ordinary story of unfaithfulness and deceit. Kelly keeps you glued to her novel, feverishly turning the pages to find out what happens when they ALL FALL DOWN.Reviewed by CandaceKof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,I felt no effect,"This product didn't changed my mood, my cognitive or anything else in any way. I don't know if it works for people older than me (i'm 47 year old). I'll keep trying it for a couple of months just to see if i'll fell any change. Otherwise i'll stop using it."
3,Townes Van Zandt fans...,This is a pretty good video for Townes Van Zandt fans...it pretty much covers his life and has a lot of footage of him. It has some rough language throughout...but all in all a good dvd for fans.
3,townes van zandt - be here to love me,Not what I expected...I assumed that it was a concert. I should have looked at it closer...
5,Good documentary,great documentary for generally unknown musical genius - many people have heard songs that he has written covered by a wide variety of performers
2,More movie and less fighting...,"First Strike is another title for Jackie Chan. I believe him to have excellent fighting abiltity and he shows it in the very few fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes that are there are incredible as usualy... but there are really only two major scenes with combat in them. For a fighting movie, it's not that great, but the fights are amazing. Just too few."
4,"Sticks, Tables and Ladders. OH MY!","This is Part Four to one of Chans greatest films ever, Police Story. Police Story 2, which is VERY GOOD, and one of Jackie Chans most famous movies in America SUPERCOP, which is Police Story 3, all come before First Strike. First Strike has the humor and fighting you expect from Chan films. In this Chan resumes the role of Kevin Chan, Hong Kongs best cop, and is helping the KGB and CIA on a case which leads him to a great snowboard and snowmobile chase in Russia. And then he heads to Australia. Plot twists galore lead Chan into trouble with everyone. One of my favorite fight scenes ever is the LADDER MATCH, this fight has to be seen! IT IS THAT GOOD! I have seen almost every JC film and the ladder match is one of my favorite. I watch this fight all the time and love it more each time. This is a great JC film. Not the best of the Police Story series, as the first Police Story is just incredible. But First Strike is still fun to watch over and over. Buy it now!"
2,My least favourite Jackie film,"The most memorable thing for me in this film is the North Face outdoor suit (in glaring yellow and black) that Jackie ends up accidentally wearing for most of the film. I am sure that sounds superficial, but while I have seen this film twice, I found little in it to rival either the older and cheaper Hong Kong made Chan films, or the slightly bigger budget ""Jackie in America"" films. I am an Australian, and that may affect my perception of the exotic locales. Frankly it was unconvincing. But please, come ski our fabulous mountains anyway."
4,"Great, fun, action-packed film","Jackie Chan use to do stunts for Bruce Lee so this guy knows his stuff. This movie is heavily dubbed so beware, but it is still too good to care entirely. It is a really funny movie! I wasn't expecting it the first time I watched it. There are some really terrific fight scenes too. Really classic Jackie Chan. If you love his movies be sure to not miss this one!"
2,Movie is fine but...,"I watched the Chinese version of this movie on youtube before. The story line goes Jackie Chan, a Hong Kong police officer going to Ukraine to Russia to Australia. Movie itself is fine one of typical Jackie Chan movies. In Chinese version they use languages by the location of scene in Chinese, English and Russian which were more realistic. I expected to hear at least some Russian with English captions on this DVD but they were all overdubbed English voice through entire movie, which felt like watching a cheap movie on TV."
4,This is a highly watchable fun movie,"One of my problems with some of jackies movies is the mediocre production or what I call watchability. This movie combines what we like best about Jackie, and it was made with high quality production so it is very watchable.I bought this one before renting it first and was not sorry. This is one of Jackies best."
3,Weird Eh?,"I must admit, I've seen this movie about five times and I still have a slightly difficult time keeping up. It jumps from place to place, and there are about 8 twists, which come and go without warning. Not to mention that the ending is INCREDIBLY lame and there is only one (great) fight scene. A great action movie, an average Chan movie."
4,A great film.,"This film has to be in Jackie's top ten. It is great. The fights are amazing (look out for the ladder fight) and the stunts are just phenominal (look out for the stunt where Jackie jumps off a cliff onto a helecopter and comes so close to the rotor blades, his hat is shredded into peices). A great film. Well worth the money."
5,First Strike (1996),"GREAT STUFF! This film and the music is very much like James Bond. This is even better than all the James Bond films combined! Highlights: the ladder fight scene and of course the skateboard chase. this chase is like James Bond's but only it ends better because he jumps off a cliff, grabs a helicopter, the helicopter gets exploded, Jackie lets go, lands into an ice frozen pond and stays under water for about 30/40 seconds. Jackie almost died of hypothermia in this stunt!"
5,Glorious,"This collection, covering an astonishingly wide range of work from many different historical periods, should be in every library. With as many magical discoveries as old favorites. Not to be missed.(And be sure to find The Rattle Bag as well)."
5,A Must Have,"Studying the blues, jazz, or ska? Get a good teacher, buy this book, and practice from it often.I use it with all my students who are interested in learning improvisation, and so do many, many music teachers."
2,same old stuff rehashed,"first off let me say that i don't think most of the reviews below are legitimate. maybe some of them are, but i think most of them were written by the book company. read them yourself and judge for yourself. to me they all read like excerpts from a press release (and none of them have written any other reviews...not that i should talk because this is my first review). secondly and most importantly this book is just the same old same old. i read a lot of these kinds of books because i have a lot of time on my hands but even the title is kind of pretentious. it's not a BAD book and there's actually some good advice here. but for my hard earned money, there are a lot of other books i'd reccommend before this one. just one mans opinion though."
2,This is not a good movie.,Poor effects and plot. Did not feel real. The acting was forced and over scripted. I just couldn't buy into it.
3,Mediocre at best,"Of the two volcano related movies of 1997 (the other being Dante's Peak), this is definitely the weaker of the two. While Tommy Lee Jones pulls of his role magnificently, as always, I found some of the other cast members to be flat and unrealistic at times.The plot is easy to follow, reasonable, and almost realistic, I suppose. There were a few moments in the movie where excitement reached a fairly high degree of intensity (screaming girl looking up at a falling building) but most of the movie was a flat line for me."
4,Not A Picture-Postcard View,"Not a sterotypical, picture-postcard view of Las Vegas, this book captures sights and elements of the Entertainment Capital of the World through a photgrapher's eye. At some types surreal, at all times captivating, it is a pleasant visit to Vegas focusing on on streamlined, beatiful photography. Mr. Newton's introduction properly sets up the visuals, with his insight into this One-Of-A-Kind city. Definitely worthwhile, especially for those NOT looking for a typical tourbook!"
3,"GREAT STORY , BAD WRITING","THE AUTHOR TURNED A GREAT STORY INTO A VERY BORRING READ , IT SEEMS LIKE HES NOT A GOOD WRITER OR A GOOD CRUDE OIL TRADER , MAYBE HE CAN TURN THIS STORY INTO A HOLLYWOOD FILM THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA"
3,Clarifications only muddy the already darkened waters,"Whitley Strieber felt the compulsion to further explore the events he described in Communion and clear up some facts. He only makes the reader doubt him more. More hearsay and nothing truly concrete, unless you take the author's continual statements of truthfulness at face value. Will frustrate even the most forgiving of readers. I still found it interesting reading, but just barely."
5,This book is out of this world,"I loved this book, it is full of revelations about the mysteries of the human soul, and reveals that the universe is much bigger and multifaceted than the average man or woman could have ever guessed. This book is very deep, and has a definite spiritual feel to it. The book is a non fiction but poetic account of a man named whitney streiber, who has been abducted by aliens, numerous times throughout his entire life, beginning when he was a young boy. Transformation is highly literate, and extremely well written. It is never dull, a true page turner. The book reveals how whitley strieber the most famous abductee in america has been transformed both mentally and spiritually by his abduction experiences. Highly recommended to anyone interested in ufos, the new age, freemasons, life on other planets, reincarnation, God and spirituality, as well as the deepest insights into the human psyche."
2,The best disappointment,"Coming from Afghanistan, I think this book is a disappointment. Either I am not afghan enough to appreciate the recipes or this book (and by that, the cook or the author) needs some more learning...It is a quick guide for the gastronomes wanting to try out something ""Afghan"" ... but be sure that the real thing a million (if not more) times better.Regards"
5,Bead It!,"What a wonderful book! The projects are designed by a number of different artists, so there is a lot of variety in the styles of the projects. There are tons of different kinds of things to do (ie clothing, jewelry, functional items like boxes). Many of the projects are quite simple and can be done with easy-to-find materials. I had a lot of the materials on hand. The projects are straightforward and look great. Many can be used as a jumping off point so that you can be creative and add a personal touch. I am so glad that I bought this book."
5,WOW!,I enjoyed this book so much. I want to make everything in it. It will inspire you in so many ways. Great instructions too. This book is worth buying. I hope there is another book coming with more ideas.
5,Document Examination on the Computer,Outstanding book for the document examiner! I highly recommend it to anyone who needs another tool to resolve issues with computer-generated documents. It's easy to understand and has great illustrations.
2,What a waste!,I have to say that even though Teti Hatcher's performance was good the movie itself was terrible. The plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable. I can;t believe I wasted my money on this one!
3,ok,"I saw the movie years ago while she was on Lois and Clark, before the Desperate housewives craze.It was an ok movie , nothing special and I really dont think anything changes because of her (Teri Hatcher) newfound fame. The big calling card of the movie is Teri Hatcher nude,if this is why you want to watch the movie it will not disappoint,and as I said earlier it was OK>"
3,Pretty Good if you like Teri Hatcher,"Yes, that's right...she gets naked. that, in my opinion, is the only reason I give it 3 stars. Other than that, it's a pretty dull and boring movie, until near the end when it gets.....weird!"
2,Teri Hatcher,See Teri Hatcher before she was a Desperate Housewife and get to see her as a Desperate Actress. She and her acting partner (the future bad guy in Terminator 2) are both horrible.
3,The post-Superman slump,"Teri Hatcher cavorts with the new guy in the neighborhood, just out of the slammer; conventional, with a surprise ending."
4,It was a beautiful dress,I bought this dress for my cousin and it was a beautiful dress. She loved it!.
4,Almost perfect,"The book is amazing, but our copy was missing pages.Pages 54-55 appear twice, once where they should be and then again pages 166-167Missing art work is two paintings of darth maul comic book covers (darth maul numbers 1-3)Otherwise this is an incredible book."
5,"Waiting, waiting, waiting....","I have wanted this book for about 1 year back when it was supposed to come out. It got delayed big time to ensure the ""quality of the product"". Since then, the revised release date came and went along with several others that seem to be 1 month later with each passing month... I wouldnt be surprised if it doesnt come out until march, if it comes out at all....... but hopefully it'll be here in time for Christmas."
3,The binding comes apart after only a week!,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the quality of this book, Drew Struzan; Oeuvre. I have purchased this book from Amazon.ca and I am sending back my Fourth copy!Every copy has had the binding come apart after only a week or so and after only flipping through a half dozen times or so.I would think a book of this quality art would have much higher quality materials and workmanship."
3,BETTER TITLES ARE AVAILABLE,"As a chidren's story Bible, this book has two strong points in its favour:1. The pictures are respectful and faithful to the Bible. For example, care has been taken to ensure that there are no pictures of Christ's face, since this would portray an illustrator's imagination rather than Biblical truth.2. The stories are faithful to the Biblical text, and do not contain exegetical errors or man centered theology.However, these advantages are outweighed by a very large disadvantage: The story telling is very poor and dull. The way the stories are told is distinctly dull, and does not interest children. Our children lost interest as a result, and we were compelled to begin using a different children's Bible.Recommended instead: The Children's Story Bible by Anne DeVries."
5,I grabbed hold of this book and read straight through the night,I finally found a definitive text that helped me see the bible through a metaphysical interpretation. Absolutely an invaluable find. I greatly recommend it.
4,Entertaining and different,The weird science makes it a little different from the average police crime drama and there's humor as well. The lead characters are interesting.
5,Very interesting,This series is one that I missed out on when it was introduced on TV. Too bad for me but luckily I can now watch it on Amazon Prime. So far I have watched the first season and I am hooked. Try the pilot and you'll be hooked too.
4,Very good show - holds up well over time,"Lots of unexpected but welcome twists and turns. Very similar in that way to Lost. A bit contrived and too fast paced as compared to reality, but I guess this is what's required for a 1 hr show. Quite entertaining. Likeable characters, although they are just a wee bit too competent."
5,A Trip to the Outer Banks.,Our son has recommended that we watch this for a long time. We decided to give it a tryand were amazed at the way good acting and science fiction blend for an episode thatcaptured us immediately.
5,Fringe - The first season,Love it! Great show. Totally recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to start watching season #2. Walter rocks :)
2,Casting,Good casting except one lady. Being a Scully/ Molder fan -I wish main characters were like them. Seems like there is a lot of overacting in this series.
5,New X Files,"I consider Fringe the new X Files,it's that good. Fantastic story line and great visual style. Dr Bishop is my favorite."
4,Love Fringe,"Gotta love Walter. He is quite a character. And Anna Torv is an excellent actress, not to mention very attractive."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,Its one of the greatest shows I ever saw. I watched the first season almost non-stop. Brilliant characters and the plot is fascinating. The structure of the dvds is great with comments on each episode and extras on each dvd (also in almost every episode).Absolutely recommended.
3,Better than the depressing news,"It is an Ok series, i did not expect much from season one as i read reviews on this show. Cant say its gripping, original or somthing i would whole heartedly be able to reccoommmmedn to a freind. it does warm up a bit after a few episodes, dont get too excited or turned off by it."
4,Intruiging,"I have watched episodes past season 1, then watched season 1 again. Good set up of characters, and good job pulling you in to the story-line. Even after watching a second time, I was glued to the computer/TV. Can't get enough of Walter. Noble portrays his character perfectly! Fringe season1 is better that X-Files season 1."
3,Not as interesting as I had hoped,"Pretty run of the mill type series, starts well and then takes on the usual TV formula, doesn't really develop credible characters. just another pulp series aimed at the average simple minded US TV consumer, why can't they learn from the Europeans?"
3,Not my favorite sci-fi,This is not my favorite sci-fi but have enjoyed a few episodes. Effects budget seems low and I sometimes get irritated by the characters. But if you need a sci-fi fix this will sometimes do it when there is nothing else new.
5,Fringe,I am very happy with this purchase. It arrived in a timely manner and in the described condition.
1,Xfiles-copycat,"If only it was fun to watch, but no, it tries to catch the x-files storytelling but it fails horribly. Studid narrative tricks, everything linked to multiverse, whith that you can tell everything and anything without ever clarifying something.There is absolutely no reason to watch this show it's meaningless, even more when there is fine sci-fi shows like terminator the sarah connor chronicles."
1,Avoid,"Terrible 'plot'. Bad Acting. Bad writing.And if by some miracle it does get better, can you really trust FOX? They will just cancel it anyway. Does Firefly or Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles ring a bell? Great shows canceled prematurely. Do not let this happen to you. Just avoid this terrible show from the start."
1,Don't bother,This show is unwatchable awful and a horrible network. I can't believe FOX would renew this crap and cancel Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
5,Fringe The First Season,"The price was right and the entertainment was great. If you are a SciFi buff, Fringe is a great series that you will love. I equate it with the X-Files.KenWebmasterAbout Facts Net"
3,Overused Plots But Fun to Watch,"This is NOT science fiction, it's fantasy. Ultimately the plots became so convoluted I doubt even the writers could figure out what was going on let alone the viewers. Way too many story arcs apparently happening simultaneously, too many hanging threads. I gave Fringe 1-star for originality (alternate universes? X-Files plot-lines? Been there, done that) but 5-stars for casting, loved the characters and the on-screen chemistry they created each week -- it was the only reason I kept watching. Never the less, X-Files was a better series overall.Considering all the trash that's on T.V. these days, this show is a cut above, family-viewable and generally interesting enough to keep you coming back for more. For that reason I gave them 3- 3.5 stars."
5,Sight-Unseen I will give this DVD 5 stars!!,"GET THIS DVD. There i said it. That's all you need. Yes you have to watch it from the beginning to get the full history of what's going on, but with people's faces dripping off their heads, dead guys running around in other people's minds, a latch jaw lady who will eat your spine, an electromagnetic man, and a guy who's emotions are so strong that you feel what he feels. what's not to love!?!?! Get this. It's only going to get better next season and you don't want to be trying to play catchup later this year."
5,very good show.,"almost like the x-files, however this show does it own thing. I love Walter, he is perhaps one of the main reasons I watch."
5,Fringe Season 1,I got this as a gift for my husband. It was new and unopened as described. I am pleased with this purchase.
5,Fringe is the best!,"If you like sci-fi, you need to watch Fringe. I am so bummed it's out of production but at least I have my CDs to remind me what good sci-fi should look like. My recommendation, BUY ALL SEASONS!!!"
5,The strange and the beautiful.,"I can do 20 standing Penn my head!Finally Tv show written from one of my many dreams. Love three acting. As real as you can make reactions to stuff so unorthodox that a real person would have to act out your surprise in many of these situations.Love the cast. The good Dr. Is, off course one my favorite people. Love how theories start out mere notion. by the ends off the episode the characters have proven the theory and then some. LoveThis show."
3,Entertaining,"The show is about super natural events with a scientific explanation. Walter, the main scientific is also the one who knows everything and I mean everything, he is specialist in biology, physics, astrophysics, quanta mechanics, neurology and more. There is nobody who knows that much, that is the most non-real of the show. There are some non-logical scenes that very good shows fix instead. The show is entertaining and it could be better taking care of details."
3,Not a big fan,This is another show like X_Files. A lot of weid things happen. This season was not that bad but this show never hooked me.Hated the father Walter. He annoyed me. The main lead girl was boring. Best thing in this show is the Jackson guy.If you are into deep mystery and stuff that repeats itself and weid twist then buy. Overall it is not all that Glad this show is off the air. As the show went on it got worst.
4,Good SciFI,Seems like an interesting show. SciFi and not over the top. But I'll watch one or two more just to waste time.
5,GREAT series!,"This is not only a great show, but is smart and has some comedy sprinkled throughout. The characters are likable and the writing is great."
4,Started Slow,"The season starts off really slow. However, as time passes the intensity and the use of fringe science picks up throughout."
2,Really want to like the show,"This series sounded similar to X-Files so I've been giving it a try. The core characters have decent chemistry and are enjoyable but the science and story lines are not believable even for scifi (unless you are 17 years old). Oh amazing, the Dr. found another cure in 8 hours... I am often bored to death as each episode unfolds hoping it will eventually grab me. I have 5 more to watch to finish the first season. Is it worth my time? We will see how disparate I get."
3,Bought It a lot cheaper.,I bought season 1 of fringe at sam's club for only $18! If you want it for a lot less go there.
3,"Show is great, product not so great","We really like the show and because of this, and so I am giving it three stars. But we are not happy at all with the product we received. As with other reviews the menu is next to impossible to navigate. There is definitely a problem with the menuing on these discs. We personally think they simply forgot to include a top menu. We are using a Sony Blu-Ray and each disc starts playing automatically (like every other Warner show we own), but nothing allows us to select the episode. When we select top menu, the episode name is displayed, along with any special features and we can select the special features, but we cannot select the episode to watch. Only tabbing through the chapters gets us to the next episode."
5,Good start,Definitely a good start to this series. It gets you wondering about many things in our universe and leaves you asking many questions about where this series is going.
5,Intriguing episodes,I hadn't heard of this show before seeing it on Amazon. Weird stories with great delivery and the characters are well played. I am really enjoying the shows.
4,Fringe Review,I loved the story line and the sound quality was perfect. The video quality was a little less than perfect due to the fact that it phased in and out of HD quality and a lower resolution. Everything else was great.
5,Awesome series,"I was told about this series and Amazon was the only place I found the Season Opener...I am so hooked on this show now, it is an excellent show with great story lines. It alone is worth joining Prime..."
4,Never a Dull (or even ordinary moment)!,"Fun and interesting characters. High Quality Acting. Bizarre and ""oh so wonderful"" themes. Twists upon twist, yet continuity of (interesting) storyline throughout! A winner of a show!"
5,Great Show,"First let me say I LOVE syfy, this is the best thought out show i have seen my only complaint is season 5, why did the show had to end."
4,"Kind of a ""Fringe"" Theme","This is a series that was recommended to me and initially I was not too impressed. The subject matter is just quite a ways out there. What pushes it into the ""like"" category for me is the very good acting and character development. Without those I doubt that I would have kept watching the series. This is one of those series that grows on you."
5,Great entertainment!,If you like science fiction with a bit of comedy thrown in you will enjoy watching these episodes. Just don't expect it to be too serious.
5,Fringe: First Season,"Although I'm a longtime sci-fi fan, for what ever reason I never watched Fringe when it was in first run production. I watched my first episode of Fringe a few weeks ago and was immediately hooked. It has great storylines. J.J. Abrams is a true sci-fi visionary!"
3,So So,"The acting seems real then it seems stupid. It's done well enough to another series, but you might find yourself pausing the program and getting up to clear the cob webs out of your head.."
4,Not a BIG Sci-Fi Fan,Who would've guessed I'd like this entire series. Kept my interest and had lots of twists/turns. Like CSI with some thinking out of the box~ Very enjoyable!
5,For those that love SiFi,This show combines the suspense and intellect of a crime and science fiction and then throws in a bit of humor. I love the show.
4,Fringe: FIrst Season (streaming),"I know Fringe is on SciHD now, and I've just seen a few episodes here and there but I think this is one of those shows you really need to start from the beginning to understand the whole story. With the Prime Membership I'm able to watch all of these free streaming onto my TV through my Blu Ray player. Obviously some episodes are better than others, but the characters are great and you can tell it's building up to something big. But like anything, you have to be in the right mood. And liking sci-fi helps"
4,A Great Series,"If you like the X Files, you'd like this show. It is very different than the X Files, but similar in the way it brings us in a whole new odd way of entertaining extreme possiblities.The cast perfroms a theatrical quality show. John Noble is one of the best actors ever to watch on prime time TV.Each season progreses into a new kind of Fringe twist. It never loses it's mystery and it is fun to watch the cast grow with the show as we do.I don't have time to explain the plot details. I will say that there are the odd sci-fi X file like episodes filling in between the bigger story of an alternate universe playing out. If it seems mind blowing, it is but the characters will guide you through the experience. It is a well acted, directed and written show.I have it in my collection along with Haven, Millenium and the X Files. I am now enjoying that new show, Grimm. If you like these also and have not seen Fringe, it is worth a try."
2,Broken inside the case.,The hinges on the inside of the case were broken. I kept it anyway because I wanted to view the first season of Fringe immediately.
5,Christmas Present,My wife and I saw the first season 6 years ago and every episode of every season. We gave this First season as a Christmas present to one of our daughters who had it on her Christmas list.
1,watch people get 'operated' on - no thank you,"A great idea gone wrong. For having the production team behind the series, it was very disappointing to have it turn into a horror show. There are some great characters and a story line that is tight and well-written. What ruins it is the graphic experimentation and pain you experience. Was looking for a show to engross me in scifi, not gross me out."
2,fringe disk review,Everything would have been fine but the 2nd disk was blank because the dvd player would not recognize it as a disk - returned item.
2,Need more space?,"I love the series, but I find out the dvd version has spanish subtitles but the blu-ray version don't have it, must be a joke, having all that space, and missing that!!!!!!!"
1,Subtitles?,"Why not portuguese subtitles in Blu-Ray if it's available in DVD?In fact, Brazil and USA are in the same Blu-Ray region, which does not occur with the DVD, ergo, it's possible for a brazilian to buy a Blu-Ray in USA, but if a DVD is bought, probably it won't work.If portuguese subtitles where included, sales to brazilian customers would florish.Regarding the series itself, definitely it's THE Best Sci-Fi series since X-Files.Thanks!"
1,Science,"The science in this show is atrocious. I streamed the first 3 episodes and cringed in every single one. It feels as if they didn't even try to get it right. The episode with the brain surgeon murderer was probably the worst as it discussed a guy who surgically removed pituitary glands and ate them for the hormones to keep him young. While it is true that the pituitary gland controls aging, the show claims that consuming the pituitary allows the murderer to live longer. If anything, eating the pituitary gland would cause aging due to the consumption of growth hormone which stimulates cell division. This is just one of the many flaws with the science of the show and has led me to feel that it is not worth my time.All in all, this show made me feel sick to my stomach, It made me rage at the scientific inaccuracies, and it has poorly developed characters and a weak plot. Try it for yourself if you must but I don't think it's worth watching."
5,"Fringe, Seen Ep. 1-20, But.....","Before i buy the season, does season one have 1-20 or was it cut off before the April airing? I would like to know.I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!its like CSI + SIFIwell better."
4,Potential,"Show has great visuals, good story line. I hope that all is not connected to older Bishop and his forty year old experiments. They need stand alone independant cases not related to him, that he helps solve."
3,Good stories but shows too much graphical violence,"The stories in Fringe are good, intelligent and well done. But my main reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is because there is too much graphical violence. It is too much shock factor for me. If they can eliminate that, it would make these an excellent series."
3,"Great show, poor quality streaming","I was able to watch Hulu, WB online and bootleg epsiodes of this for free that were better quality. I paid because I thought the quality would be better and there would be no hassle with ads and broken links, etc. I am annoyed that I paid for this and the quality was so bad."
3,Not so great...,"So much for the new ""X Files""...I would think they have learnt their lesson :Too ""serious"" for my own taste!One of the only ""new thing"" seems to be the names of the places written all over the screen(like ""Panic Room"" (2002): not so new...)I just hope it will get better with time !"
4,Wish I watched this from the beginning!,"Recently got amazon prime and was looking for something 'free' to watch. Came across Fringe, which I had always knew exsisted but never watched, and I'm hooked! I know the SERIES finale is airing this month, and I'm only halfway through the first season, but I'm excited to see where the show goes."
4,great show,I like the story line reminds me of a more modern X files. I love being able to watch it on my own terms with prime.
4,Good,This is a good series. It seems well made and is definitely interesting and mysterious. The characters seem real and the overall tone of the series is compelling. There are some campy moments and there seems to be a disconnect between what the series will be about and what it is actually about. For a first season this is a pretty good installment.
5,Lost fans have a new show.,I was not willing to jump to this show after LOST and now I regret it. A fantastic show. I will watch every episode.
3,Episode Navigation Issues,"Navigation seems REALLY clumsy.I just got the discs in the mail and popped it in, but could not for the life of me could not figure out how to navigate to the second, third, etc. episodes on the disc and watch them. If you just pop the disc in, it auto-plays from the 1st episode. If you go to the Title Menu, it shows you Behind the Story for all of the episodes, but no way to navigate to the episodes themselves. There's also a Play Episode button there, but it just starts playing from the 1st episode.I actually have tried two different Sony Blu-Ray players and got the same results on both.Sure, you can start watching the 1st episode and just skip chapters to the episode you want to watch, but there's got to be a better way than that.Okay, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but if anyone has info on how to do this, please comment to this post. My internet searches have not turned up any other posts from people having this problem, so I assume it's just me."
4,Very interesting premise,"This show is one of my favorites. The plots are always interesting and they lead to more questions than they answer. The actors are overall good, although Anna Torv is a little one demensional. Joshua Jackson and John Noble are very good and both have some great one liners.Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes the whole syfy, paranornal, conspiracy theory type of show."
