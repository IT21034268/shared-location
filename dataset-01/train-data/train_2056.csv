2,limited,"This is a small pocket guide that does not explain very much and basically includes mostly his steps as written in his other books.These steps are not very detailed, and some of his other books include a more detailed approach.I would recommend buying Victory over the Darkness which teaches the truths needed to learn before you go through this."
5,PHENOMENAL,This is the best I have read on Spiritual Freedom. It is practical. It is biblically based. I highly recommend it!
5,Awesome,God is Awesome. This book is awesome. I cannot even find the words to describe how wonderful this is. This book is a must have for all christians.
5,This CD represents what is really goin down in LA,"Kam, drops a clever touch of hardcore reality through his lyrics on this debute release. The words that are used in his rhyming, and timing are a lyrical vision of the truisms of Los Angeles, Compton, and Watts. This album deservs a listen by everyone in America."
4,one of the best rap albums of 93,"kam gets all political on here backed by ice cube this was pretty hard hitting kam lets us know the real deal about so called holidays that christmas, and easter are satanic in origin yeah there's peace treaty on here that uses p funk samples other samples I dig are from sly stone, james brown, vaughn mason and the moments."
2,What happened to...?,"PEACE:I wonder why they are not selling Kam's CD entitled ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" here?LM"
5,helpful,I've only read the first chapter but it has already been a great help to me. It's a sort of like a user friendly text book.
3,Average.,"After reading all of the reviews here I had to have this book! But after reading several pages things started reminding me alot of training seminars I've taken where most of your time is spent looking at your watch and hoping lunch-time arrives soon or the speaker has an emergency and needs to call it a day, sooner than later, if at all possible. It's boring the way frozen pizza is boring or most college courses are boring or selling shrimp from the roadside is boring. Large chunks of the book are the same stuff every writing book includes. And, in fairness, I did find one or two helpful hints that are new to me. But 5 Stars it aint."
4,Great Basic Guide,"This book is terrific for people who are just starting to try to write. It breaks down every initial stumbling block of the craft into small pieces in ways that are easy for inexperienced writers to understand and model. For more experienced writers, it might be useful to see the mechanical process for things one already understands (even innately). However, this is not a stunningly useful book for writers with more than a little experience."
4,"Beginnings,Middles & Ends.",This is an easy to follow guide. It asks for a little thought but does not get bogged down in the jargon of the critique. Very easy to use.
3,"soft, pretty but hard to clean.","I just got this car seat and love how soft and pretty the seat is. I washed the padding for my daughter is born but feeding the straps back through is a complete nightmare. it took 30 mins the first time then i realized it was back wards and to repeat it and the 2nd time took 20 mins, then after those 2 times i realized i forgot to put the head rest on, and another 20 mins trying to feed the straps through. i hope this seat works well, my sister has it and loves it. everything about it is wonderful except when you want to clean the seats padding."
3,Just ok,"I have owned 2 other infant seats and 4 other convertable car seats. This one did not impress me.Things I liked:1. The LATCH's were easy to use.2. Baby felt secureThings I Disliked:1. Fabric very uncomfortable on my baby's skin and wore out very quickly (like in 2 months)2. Baby was very uncomfortable in this seat3. Did not fit will with my Baby Trend StrollerOverall I liked this one much better than my Eddie Bauer, but not as much as my Graco. It was OK for the money, but to be honest if I have another baby I will skip the infant seat and just use a convertable car seat. I dont think infant seats are all that convenient. I usually end up taking the baby out if we are using the stroller and wearing a sling."
4,Served it's purpose,"This car seat worked out well for us. All the features were amazing and the base was heavy which made me feel safe when sticking the car seat in it. I didn't give it 5 stars because we had a problem adjusting the crotch strap. It is removable but we had to break out tools to get the metal part out of the grooves. Other than that, it worked out well and served its purpose."
1,"Unless you have a preemie, don't bother","My son is 4 months old, and he has already outgrown the seat. Well, I should say he has outgrown the straps.He is not overly large for a baby at 16lbs. His height isn't even that much over 50% for his age. Even with nothing on but a romper, the straps are so tight around his shoulders and the strap between his legs is so short that I feel like I'm going to break him just keeping it all together.I know this seat got a great rating when safety testing - it's why I purchased it. But they could not have possibly actually testing its safety with a typical 6 month old."
2,Hate it. Steer clear.,I own three car seats and this one is the most difficult to operate: the handle release is very difficult to operate (on a scale of 1 to 10 it is a 10) and the straps are too short (can you hear the screaming and uncomfortable baby right now?). I give it two stars because my child will never be harmed in it. How could he since I'll never use it.
2,OK at first...,"I got this car seat with the travel system and I thought it was very cute and easy to move in and out of the car. It was great when my baby was very little (0-3 months), but she is now just over 4 months and we can barely fit her in the seat! The belts are so tight they smash her shoulders and most of the time cannot even slip over her shoulder properly...they fall to where they are around the side of her upper arm!! She is not a particularly big baby. She weighs about 16 pounds and is 26.5-27 inches. I was very disappointed that I was unable to use this car seat as long as I hoped. I would suggest that, although pricey, your best bet is to get a convertible car seat such as the Britax Roundabout, because it is safe, convertible and will hold a child until she is 50 lbs! Don't spend your money buying something that will be useless in a matter of months!"
1,Six week old doesn't fit.,"With our first daughter we used a graco travel system. I wasn't overly impressed with anything about it and with our second daughter we were looking for something a little sturdier for better peace of mind.Unfortunately, our daughter is SIX WEEKS OLD AND DOES NOT FIT IN THIS CAR SEAT. She is in the 95th percentile at 13 lbs. Yes, I have loosened the straps as much as they will go. As of right now, I am barely able to squeeze her into it. I can't even put a sweatshirt on her or she will not fit. It's December in Massachusetts, and now I am shopping for a new car seat for our six week old. Unless you have a very tiny baby, don't bother with this seat. What a horrible investment."
2,Buyer's remorse - despite safety claim,"I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on. In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat. The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks. Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable. I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances. Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat."
3,The Handle Release is Hard,We bought this because of the good safety reveiws. We also liked it because it is nice looking. We get comments on how nice it looks. I don't recommend it to people because of the handle. It's VERY hard to put up and down. You have to crawl in the car and grab the release with both hands while pulling back and wrestling with it to get it to go down. Not very easy if you have small hands. My husband even has trouble with it sometimes. Also if it is raining and you are trying to get the baby in the car and the handle down you will get soaked. It's not a fast chore. Other than that it looks nice but I probably would get something different.
5,My Favorite Movie to Recommend,"Possibly the most miserable waste of time to come by the screen. I hated Turtle Diary and recommend it as often as possible to friends (non of whom have ever heard of it) in hopes that I may be the cause of their misery in watching it. Really it's pointless and tasteless, except that the producer seems so having something for flares of red in an otherwise bland set--this having no connection to the story, but seems as though it should in some twisted way. This movie is always near my top 10 picks in hopes that someone will chance to watch it on my account--a delight of which I have not yet enjoyed--but when said event occurs, I will cackle with glee. Seeing as I anticipate this future merth I easily rate Turtle Diary at 5 stars. I might buy this movie someday when feeling wealthy and unsatisfied with people in general."
4,Good basic towel holder,"Good metal countertop paper towel holder, does the job and I like it for the price."
4,Nice looking modern style,"I wanted to replace an old wooden, with tulips, 'country'style paper towel holder with something more modern. I saw some I liked but they were in chrome. I did not want the bright chrome in the kitchen. So I ordered this Satin Nickel one. Much softer and more attractive. I was concerned that as it did not have an opposing lever to tear off one sheet at a time,and to hold the sheets in place, they would just drape all over the counter. But I just slightly tuck the next sheet into the bottom and it works great. Looks great. works well. Price is right."
1,Scary Silly Movie,"This movie has graphics & video from the 80's. The kids are wearing face paint which makes the video seem bizarre and scary. This was a gift for my nephew, but after 2 mins of staring at it in horror, I turned it off. This will be going into the trash."
5,This album fits in with th Zeppelin Catalog....,"Yes, it's that good! Many fans have never given Plant the credit he deserves! This cd is incredibe! You can almost imagine this as what Zeppelin would have sounded like had they never broken up!! If you have heard Plant's other solo cds, and have been disappointed, please give this one a try! It's light-years ahead of the rest! ""Come into my Life"" is simply a gut-wrenching beautiful song! Other highlight are ""Great Spirit"", which sounds like it would fir perfectlybetween ""No Quarter"" & ""The Ocean""!!!!!!!"
4,Plant's finest solo moments.,"There would be very few Plant fans who would deny this is Robert's best solo record. I have them all, and the only one that gets nearly as much air time in my house is The Principle of Moments. On Fate Of Nations Robert tames his vocals. No more superfluous wailing of words like ""c'mon"" and ""babeeeee"" as he is prone to do. His singing is restrained and rich, unleashings of his patented wail restricted to where they fit seamlessly into the surrounding tapestry of sound. The music is strong, well written, and melodic (strip away all the trappings, leave Robert and an acoustic guitar, and they'd nearly all still stand up well). The production is rich and atmospheric without being too polished. My only criticism is that the momentum built up at the start seems to tail off towards the end. Perhaps a revised track order would have done the job. A challenge maybe to Plant fans with CD burners who agree with me. If you like Robert's other efforts, you'll love this one."
4,Fate of Nations by Robert Plantt,"This is typical Robert Plant. He is a pioneer of good ol' Rock'n'Roll and this album is no exception. I have them all now and enjoy each one over and over again! And yes, I will recommend him to friends & family too!"
5,Plants most complete album,"I am not much of a fan of the collection of works from his previous band, but most of Plant's solo albums are nothing shy of wonderful.FATE OF NATIONS and PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS are my two favorite albums from Robert Plant. While 'MOMENTS is more of a lush collection of esoteric moodscapes and lyrical ponderings, 'NATIONS is a testimonial to the self-destructive nature of modern man (and who would know better than a member of LED ZEPPELIN?)Each song resonates as a separate piece with its own sound and own context, yet the album flows near seemlessly, with each song building upon the last. I cherish this album from beginning to end. Please do yourself a musical favor and listen to the FATE OF NATIONS."
4,Excellent for quick word definitions,"I'd recommend this product to anyone learning Spanish or English. I bought this dictionary a few years ago because it was pretty cheap, small and lightweight. It served me well until I spilled water on it one day last year, and the screen stopped functioning. I still thought it was a very good product, though, and didn't want to risk my money on something different, so I bought a second one.It's excellent for looking up vocabulary quickly, whether you're listening to a professor in class or you're reading and pressed for time, however, it lacks some words a bigger dictionary would have and doesn't include any common idioms. It's also really frustrating to scroll through the long verb conjugation list, so I'd recommend buying a regular book like 500 Spanish Verbs if that's what you want."
4,Spanish/English Dictionary,"This is a great product! It's a good and quick reference for those moments when you need the words to express yourself. The only downfalls are that it doesn't work well with compound words or tenses other the present, but it's a great tool for a beginner like me."
3,obvious flaws,"I bought this product to replace my franklin TES 118, which I love but the dictionary lacks depth.I use these gadgets primarily to stick in my back pocket in order to help me with everyday situations. Oops, where the TES-118 is rugged, sweat resistant and well designed this newer model is the opposite. The minutest pressure on the 2 AA size battery compartment dislodges the batteries and erases all the personalised settings, in particular the word list which is one of the reasons I bought the thing in the first place.It comes with a ridiculous flip top cover which I guarantee will break within one weeek, perhaps this was designed to prevent the paint coming off the buttons which seems to be happening too.The dictionary is excellent though and if you are looking for a desktop gismo then this might be your thing, but surely portability is the attraction of these things, no?This product is flawed, I would not recommend it!"
1,Dissatisfied,"DBE-1470U failed. This was the third one to fail. Complained to Franklin. They offered me a new one for 39.99. I ordered. Guess what? They shipped me a different model, a DBE-1500 without warning me. I have a French-English chip that fit in the rear of the DBE-1470U. The new DBE-1500 will not accept chips. I'm out $20 for my now-useless chip and no longer have French-English translation capability. Thanks Franklin and no more Franklin for me."
3,Limited definitions of entries,"I am mildly satisfied with this purchase. It does seem to have a large variety of vocabulary. However, having said that, I most definitely would NOT call this a Dictionary. The definitions are VERY limited. I would rate this FAIR at best.The reviews sold me on it, for sure. But, I'm sorry I purchased it. I was expecting a dictionary as well. Did NOT deliver!!"
4,foreign language dictionary,"Very useful. Answers come up very quickly,and the descriptions are quite good. I struggle a bit with the small keyboard, but the only way to make it bigger would be to make the whole thing bigger, so they've made an OK tradeoff."
3,Franklin DBE-1470u,"DBE-1470uBe careful buying this product!! I recently ordered the DBE-1470u (pictured) specifically because of the arrangement of the 4 scroll buttons at the bottom of the keypad. What I received was the DBE-1470 with two scroll buttons on the bottom of the keypad and two on the left side near the top of the device. I am returning that device now. I had the same experience several years ago when I ordered a 1470u but received a 1470, but I have used that DBE-1470 since. I still want to replace my 1470 with a 1470u, but I cannot find the 1470u anywhere. My complaint may sound trivial, but you will understand after you have used the 1470 for several years."
2,Didn't last long,"I liked this product for about two weeks, until the first time it fell from the desktop to the floor, breaking the display to the point of being useless. It seems to be overly fragile, with the display not well protected."
5,awesome product,"I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone, advanced or beginning spanish. It goes into a lot of detail to explain the meaning of each word, how it is used, and how it is conjugated... what could be better?I had to buy a new one, because the screen of my old one got messed up by getting smashed someone when it was in my backpack... now i keep it in a little tin case. So I guess be careful about thatget this product!!"
4,Franklin Spanish/English Dictionary,"This translator works well. I bought a less expensive one locally, but when I tried to translate ""learn"", it didn't find ""aprender"", or any other word for ""learn"". Thought this was strange, but after many other failures like this, I bought this one. Most words I've needed are found with this translator.There are a few things I don't like. Seems like the battery loses connection occasionally, requiring preferences to be reset (e.g. font size). Also, this prevents using the ""My Word List"", as these are erased also. On a few instances, a word that is not found is used in the example phrases of another word."
3,Nice but indeed too small...,"I ordered these glasses in spite of a review that said they were too small because another review made no mention of that fact and seemed to actually be very happy with his. I got them in a very nice case but were too small. I had my 12 year old nephew try them on, and they barely fit him. They fit on me like the mask of zorro fits on zorro: barely covering his eyes. I'm very skinny, so that's not the problem. These are definitely a return which is a shame cus they were only $20!"
1,Nice but way too small,"Nice looking glasses but way, way too small for any adult. The glasses only fit my 7 yrs old son's face, and his face is not that big either. Very disappointed, now have buy a different pair at the mall. The title for these glasses should be: Diesel KIDS' Sunglasses."
5,So happy to see the world of Venice in 1200's,"I just returned from a trip to Venice and Rome and am delighted to have found this DVD TV series to help me learn more about Venice. I read the Venetian Empire by Jan Morris as well as several other books about Venice, but nothing has helped me to understand the Venetian merchant culture like this DVD. Perfect for winter viewing - enjoying it now by the fire. It's also interesting to see what Venice looked like in the 1200's since so many people associate the look of Venice with Venetian Gothic (much later). And WHAT a cast - Gielgud, Nimoy! Anne Bancroft, Burt Lancaster (almost 20 years after his role in The Leopard, another Italy-based film).Also amazing to see the shots of the Holy Land and Crusades and realize the fighting there STILL continues."
3,"Quick, Complete, But...","This arrived promptly, complete and well packaged. I appreciate that. The picture quality is relatively adequate, and probably about as good as it was when it aired in 1982. The sound quality is a bit poor though. I don't expect the kind of quality you'd get today, from a nearly 30 year old, made for t.v. miniseries, but it's definitely got a muffled sound, like it's a recording of a recording of a.... It's not so bad that we can't enjoy watching it, but it is a bit distracting. I'm sure I'd be pleased with a regular movie purchased from this seller, though."
3,Not Great but Not Bad,"It isn't the greatest definition video that you may think it is but for a movie made in 1982 and copied badly from NBC, it does tell a great adventure story that is both concise and fairly accurate."
2,Poor CD Quality,The CD was of a very poor quality and had numerous background distortions that detracted greatly from the viewing of the story. I could not recommend this from this vendor.
1,this movie messed me up for life,"No, I'm serious. I've recently been thinking about this.See, there are actually several plots in this movie, but they're all the same thing over and over again: Marco manages to make friends, save the day, and see justice prevail simply by being honest. Whether with the Pope, Kublai, those tax collectors in the south, etc.I watched this series as a very young child and it made a profound impression on me. Specifically, it convinced me that people in power simply need to hear honesty. That's all it takes. Then they'll take you under their wing, give you rapid promotions, etc.Several decades later I can state with confidence that this is not the case in the world. People in power don't want to hear honesty. They'll either think you're foolish, punish you for it, or both.But where did I get such a loony idea? This movie! I blame it on this movie!"
3,quantity over quality,bits dont last long.... But lack of quality is made up by sheer number of bits in this set. Bits did not even come sharp
3,Dull after a few uses,"I bought these to drill 2 x 4 lumber for plumbing & electrical runs. I used the 3/4"" perhaps a dozen times and now it's pretty much useless. Good value for the occasional user but if you're looking for longevity, you'll need to look elsewhere."
4,B&D spade,I am very happy with this bit set. It is not an expensive set and is not built like one. But I found it to be a very good value for the price.
5,Recommend it,"Just my two cents, great set, bunch of sizes, neat canvas case, look no further, a no brainer 5 stars."
1,Shanks not true,Got these at Walmart. Several were out of true as if the shank was bent. Some were greatly out of true. Several reviews at Lowes report the same problem with B&D spade bits. Try another brand is my suggestion. I had to return them as over half were not really usable.
3,Alright Bits,"These butterfly bits work just fine, but I recently replaced them because they do not have a true 1/4"" hex shank - so they won't work in my new drill.I replaced them with the Bosch daredevil line of butterfly bits, and the difference is night an day - but I'm storing the new bits in the roll my old Black and Decker bits came in.Summary: Fine bits in a great array of sizes, and although they aren't the best in the world, the tool roll they come in is quite handy."
2,Nothing New Here,"This volume takes the traditional ""Battlecruisers were a flawed concept"" the author puts forward Nothing new, and outrightly contradicts the author of the the companion Volume (British Battlecruisers 1914-18) It is a pity that the authors on these two volumes did not collaborate to provide a consistent theme to this story. Of the two I would recommend the companion volumne rather than this one because of the difference in view - This volume adds nothing new to the subject"
1,Disapointing,"Very disapointed in this book.The analysis and arguments presented a brief, not well argued, and the author offers nothing new.He also goes into some depth on the development and build of the ships that were turned into carriers at the end of the 1st world war. Yes these existed in 1939/45 but were not now Battlecruisers. In my opinion are not relevent to this subject and waste valuble space in even mentioning them in such a brief publication.In contrast the companion volume - British Battlecruisers 1914-18, is much better thought out and offers much more than this volume."
2,A fricking disaster,"I never wanted to write something bad about anything, but common sense obliges me to inform all the future users about the sorry Sony politic.You can see a lot of complaints out there on the Web so I will not talk long.I am a professional in computing and I must say that Sony's ""software"" is one of the worst of the kind. I could not even get it started on my work computer !Where I could - it showed instability and inconsistency.I want to use windows explorer to transfer the files ! Sony people should have made the ""transcoding"" transparent to the users. A simple shell integration would do the trick.Even my girlfriend who has close to zero knowledge about computers hates the fact that she has to install the XZxyyZgh software on her friends computer before they can transfer their favorite music.One fact:I will never - ever buy a Sony electronic musical device."
1,GOD AWFUL,"I PURCHASED THIS. PLUS YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THE CD. THIS IS NOT AN IPOD. ITS A BITCH TO USE. VERY FRUSTRATING. SO, SO, SORRY I PURCHASED IT. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SELLER BUT THE ACTUAL SONY PRODUCT."
3,Good dictionary,"This is a good dictionary, but it mostly contains the same vocabulary as in the other Teach Yourself Hindi books, so if you have already some of those books, I think you can spare it. On the contrary, if you have those books and don't want to bother to go to the back every time you need to see a word, then this is a good tool."
5,Great dictionary for English speakers learning hindi,"I began learning Hindi a semester and a half ago, this is a good dictionary for me at my stage right now. it offers a single word translations as well as phrase translations. I recommend it to people learning Hindi."
5,This book inspires one to belive in themself,I recieved this book when it was first released. I was sad when it was no longer published. It brings great joy to my heart to know that this book has been brought back to life. I have read this book to people young and old. I have been inspired by this story. I hold it dear to my heart and celebrate when I can share it with others. I am within one semester from becoming an elementary teacher and I look forward to sharing this book with my students. This book is worth keeping and reading over and over again. May this story touch your soul and inspire your heart just as it did mine.
5,My Favorite Children's Book,I purchased this book in the late 90's for my two small children. From the first time I read it I fell in love with it. As my children grew (they are both in highschool today) I gave away most of their children's books. This is one of the few that I've kept.
4,Front cover is deceiving,"Although the front cover shows a Tomcat ready to be shot this does not appear in the video, also shown isan F-15 Eagle on climb out after being shot off the deck. Air Force Eagles don't fly off carrier decks !!No modern fighter footage instead the video is about Naval aviation history and is quite informative."
4,Great video history,"Wings Over Water is a great history of aircraft carriers with lots of rare vintage film and interviews. If you are interested in history, the navy or aircraft you'll like this dvd."
4,Great product but needs updating,"This is a great remote for any Star Trek fan! My 7 year old son and I love it. However, the 4,5,6,7 number keys do not work with my 1 1/2 year old Zenith TV. It needs to be updated for the newer TV's and DVD recorders."
2,Why did it stop selling,I was going to buy this item but i never try and buy anything on amazon till the release date. Yeasterday the release date was june 22 so i was like ok I'll buy it today now i find out that its discontiunied im very unhappy about this anyways anyone who got it good job
3,How long can you play this game,"I have played this game for about 4 years now and I have seen the game change so much. For the WORST. Mythic tries to make changes to better the game but they dont work. With other and better games out there the population has gone down, now there has been clustering of 3 to 4 servers to help with the population bonus. There was a review telling people to play Albion, DONT, I have 10 lvl 50 toons, and 7 are on Albion. Albion is the one realm that lack everything that the other realms have. PICK HIBERNIA. If you want to play this game and deal with the pathing issues, the buggs that are still there after being out for 4 years, be my guest and pick this game it is enjoyable. If it wasnt i would have not played it for 4 years. Also if you feel like paying monthly for a game that is never going to satisfy you, also be my guest. Just my 2 cents from a vet. of this game."
3,Good fun,"Its good fun if you can deal with leveling to 50........then the arts.........Overall a good time, good people for the most part.Only down side is if you think your going to get a level 50 just kill, not going to happen.I do think there moving too fast for somebugs but hey! what games doesnt have bugs? Over all rating is 5 stars, untill something that can match and/or beat this, im there!"
4,shiny,"Serve their purpose well. Pain in the behind to mount and install insinde the window channel, but i like the stainless on my Bronco II better then the smoked plastic.-Koog"
2,A Universal Horror Curio,"""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1932) was a consolation prize for Bela Lugosi and director Robert Florey, who lost out on ""Frankenstein."" This very loose Edgar Allan Poe adaptation leans toward Caligari-styled expressionism, but gets bogged down in needless romantic and comic relief. Except for Lugosi's bravura performance as Dr. Mirakle, the acting is terribly weak for a Universal chiller. However, there is a brief appearance by Arlene Francis as one of Bela's victims. The film would have been stronger without the post-production tampering and cries for a major re-edit."
2,Bela's Bombshell,"Murders in the Rue Morgue is one hour and one minute long and was released on February 21, 1932. If there is a plot to this movie I could not find one. Murders in the Rue Morgue is set in 1845 Paris, France and it is based very loosely on the by Edgar Allen Poe by the same name. The movie stars Bela Lugosi as Dr. Mirakle. Dr. Mirakle is abducting women off the streets and inserting his pet gorilla blood into them so Erik (his gorilla) can have a mate. Only females with pure clean blood will the serum work on. Finally he finds one, but Erik kills Dr. Mirakle and kidnaps Camille L'Espanaye. His death ends when Pierre Dupin shoots him. The sound in this movie is horrible in the beginning. I can barely understand what is said in the first twenty minutes. This gets a D on my list. The script should have been better."
5,An amusing story for a new reading learner.,Given to a child whose Grandmother is a librarian. Well received by a reading learner. Very good value. Thank You.
5,Great Illustrations!,This is a gift for my five-year old niece who has talked her family into letting her raise chickens (you only need a small yard in Seattle). I think she will find this amusing!
5,"A soft, engaging read . . .","""The Old Man"" unfolds the heart of family -- spanning time, passing on the heretige of who we are, and sharing the stories that make us that way. It remembers the days when families and communities depended on each other for survival and what it means to grow from childhood to youth to adulthood, each step engaging further into full participation and contribution to the family livelihood.In this story, Clay Waldon has captured the elusive essance of what it means to fully live. Read this book. Look around you to capture the grace of your life in your awareness and memory. Share your own stories with those you love. Be glad that sadness doesn't have to bring despair, but opens the door to hope.""May you be firm but gentle, love and be loved, never be afraid to explore the unknown and always remember The Old Man.""I eagerly hope for a sequel."
5,Amazing information,This book brings events and information to light that most people probably do not know. The authors write with candor and credibility based on authentic sources quoted in the footnotes. Anyone hoping for a warm and fuzzy account of these times will not find it in this book.
5,Nuts and bolts of church leadership during McKay's tenure,"With chapters on ""Correlation"" and ""The Building Program,"" this is not a book that will interest everyone. It is not a biography of David O. McKay, per se. It focuses on McKay's two decades as LDS church president. The book is organized topically rather than chronologically, which leads to some repetition and jumping around. The book is based on journals and notes taken by McKay's long-time secretary, Claire Middlemiss. It provides insight into nuts-and-bolts church organizational issues, policies, budgets, etc. I would compare it (to some degree) to Bob Woodward's approach in writing about the Supreme Court in ""The Brethren."""
1,Disappointing book,"I was disappointed in this book. The authors say they support Mormonism, but they subtly present an anti-Mormon perspective on the events and people portrayed. A better book covering the same time period is The Rescue, a Biography of Thomas S. Monson."
5,Must reading for wireheads,"De Landa strikes me as a popularizer, but what he lacks in theoretical rigor he more than makes up for with discipline, serious intent, and sheer vision. Best antidote in print to the kind of mostly ignorant, ahistorical cyberphilia that dominates too much of ""Wired"" and other ongoing public discussions of our technological future. If you like this, you must not miss ""A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History"", which advances his methods and insight to a much wider, even more significant level."
2,Dubious Sources,"De Landa's theoretical connections are interesting and thought provoking but are unfortunately very often not adequately cited. In his attempt to explain the entire development of warfare, De Landa displays only a cursory knowledge of his topic frequently neglecting to mention crucial information. A few errors and mis-explanations early in the book made me question everything he had to say. This book is great for the images and connections it invokes. The theoretical leaps it makes are admirable. Do not however, rely upon this book for factual information."
3,"Alright, with cheap materials",It does its job once you get it installed. It is difficult to get installed because the metal it is made from is so cheap that the locating tabs bend out of the way instead of gripping like they are supposed to.
2,A Disappointment,"I am a huge organic products enthusiast, and I am a fan of Amy's products. I bought this soup in hopes of it having some sort of pizzaz. I was sorely disappointed.After having heated it up, I tasted it and was shocked with how bland it was. It was a meek soup, almost as if they created a black bean base, tossed some veggies in and left it at that. Uh...where are the spices?! The herbs?! The excitement!Only after adding some hot sauce, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, and sour cream did the soup become worthy to be eaten with the rest of my lunch.If you are a fan of more mild soups, this could be for you. If you're just a fan of plain veggie soups, this certainly could be for you. But if you like a little jazz in your soup, don't buy this unless you're ready to dump a jar of salsa in."
1,Skip it - Doesn't taste right,"Unless the taste of this differs by can, I would recommend to skip this soup. It just tastes very odd, and very little like black beans. I won't be buying it again."
2,Onions overwhelm otherwise low-key flavor,"The onions are overwhelming in a sharp, bitter sort of way. I love Amy's soups so went out on a limb and ordered 12. I like onions and beans, but the scent is almost ""bilish"" and I have to overcome it with alot of spices, add more beans etc. I won't order them again. Next time I will try a can first before jumping in."
2,Very disappointing,"I agree with the other user that gave this a bad rating. I hated the flavor of this soup, which was disappointing since I love black beans and I love Amy's products. It hardly tasted like black bean soup, it was so sweet and bitter at the same time... tangy, but not in a good way. After I forced myself to finish most of it, I suffered from really bad heartburn afterwards. Some people may like the taste, but I definitely did NOT enjoy it. Like the other user said, the only reason this soup deserves 2 stars is because it is healthy.I tried McDougall's Black Bean & Lime soup before and I thought it tasted pretty good; definitely a good alternative to Amy's black bean vegetable.Dr. McDougall's Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup, 3.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 12)"
2,horribly bland; worst black bean soup I've had,"While the ingredients may be organic and healthy, the soup is bland and impossible to eat without having to basically re-make it. It has no flavor at all, except perhaps a nagging sweetness from the corn. If you are interested in a savory treat or something healthy AND delicious, then find something else, or be ready to whip out your pot and start over. I'll never buy this again. The only reason it gets an extra star is because it's good for you, but that is its Only redeeming quality."
3,Time to End This Series?,"I've really enjoyed all of the previous Curbs, but the latest (Season 7) seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel. For example, re-introducing the Seinfeld cast again was a big mistake--we've all seen them many many times in others venues over the past 10 years. And they're just not fresh or funny anymore.Again, LD now seems to be overacting with little or no spontaneity. His rants, etc., which used to appear spontaneous and hilarious in the past now seem contrived. Yes, there are still a few pretty good belly laughs from time to time, but I think LD has probably milked most or all of his good ideas. I do believe it may be time to close shop and go out on top. Hate to say it."
1,BOOTLEG - I EXPECT MY MONEY BACK!!!!,"I am highly disappointed with this purchase. It's one thing if I paid $5 for this and received a street vendor version, but this is being advertised as a legitimate copy of the dvd. and it is not at all. The case has fallen apart and it is obviously not the official DVD. I expect my money back asap with no hassle."
5,Curb Review,I grew up loving Seinfeld and this season has a seinfeld reunion show. I was laughing so hard cause it was just like watching Seinfeld over 10 years ago.
5,Some super-funny episodes,"As it has been with each season, some episodes are better than others. I don't like it when I can see how Larry has used a simple formula for instant laughs instead of coming up with a truly funny idea (another argument, for example, is not funny any more after 7 seasons, just a cheap trick). But when there's a really funny idea for the plot, as there is in most of these episodes, I love it. I love Larry David and this show. My greatest escape for a laugh when I need it. Thank you Larry!"
5,Who doesn't love LD??,"I can't get enough of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry David has still got it. Funny, creative and offensive. Perfect show."
2,Seinfeld Reunion?,"Half of the cast (i.e.- Ping, Soup Nazi, Jean Paul, Steinbrenner, etc. etc.)? ""WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE? DO YOU SEE PEOPLE?""How bout ketchup & mustard in the same bottle?But they tried to write a good script and had the main cast involved. Hence, 2 stars."
4,"Decent, inexpensive phone.","I was looking for a cheap two line cordless phone, and this one does was the least expensive of all available. The phone is decent, but the keys are cheap. However it works well, and I don't mind that. This is still the first week, so I do not know how it'll work in the long term though....One potential shortcoming is that this phone only works with two SEPARATE phone lines. So for example if you have a phone jack with both line 1 & 2 coming out of one jack, the phone will not be able to recognize line 2. I had to get a A/B splitter to get the phone working. It was cheap though - 6 bucks........."
2,2-line phone,"This phone has a glaring omission, namely, it does not accommodate a duplexed line. Hence, you must have two separate jacks connected to have two line connectivity. No other phone requires that. All have an input permitting a single jack which carries both lines.As a result, I have not used the telephone and can not report on its overall quality."
2,Handsets reboot frequently,"I have owned this system for several years, and have also experienced frequently dropped calls, due to the handsets periodically crashing and rebooting when a call is picked up. Also, the headset jacks mounts are held in place soley by the cheap and flimsy solder joints on the circuit board, which is unacceptable for the type of traffic a cordless phone experiences. Two out of three headset jacks on my system had become non-functional after 18 months of normal use. My sister had a similar experience with a completely different VTech model. There is no indication from VTech that this design sloppiness has been addressed in subsequent models, so no more VTech in my future. Great feature set, but NOT recommended for reliability or the long haul."
5,Very clear and thorough,I needed this book for my moral philosophy class and this has been one of the best textbooks I have had to read. The chapters are very descriptive and easy to read.
2,What's the agenda?,"There are so many implausible and ludicrous details in this story that anyone with even minimal psychologial acuity would question the authenticity of it. It was obviously written to be filmed. It may be true that the author has suffered abuse and has DID. Raising awareness about child abuse and psychiatric disorder is always valuable. However, the details in this story are absurd."
1,I really didn't like this book.,"I cannot say how much I disliked this book. Not only did it seem completely made up, but the writing was extremely sophomoric. I'm sure someone out there has the same tale to tell and probably more experience in writing. The author seemed very narcissitic(i.e. constant descriptions of his cars and his clothes). The only reason why I kept reading was because I was hoping it would get better. I did, however,enjoy how he blamed his ""personalities"" for his extra-marital affairs. I really didn't care for this book. It didn't tell me anything interesting about DID that I didn't know already."
1,Possibly one of the worst-written books I've ever read.,"This is one of those books that makes you stare at the New York Times bestseller list and wonder how a book so badly written, so full of pseudo-science, so...lame, could possibly make the list.From the endless mentions of the brands of his and his wife's clothing to the excruciatingly purple prose to the oh-so-perfect cinematic unfolding of this story, this book was a disaster. A combination of Robert James Waller and John Gray."
2,A good fiction read...???,"I'm pretty gullible, but halfway thru this book, I came to check other reviews to see if it was just me, or if this struck others as unbelievable. I certainly don't want to denounce this man if it's all true, but his book surely doesn't read that way. As others have mentioned, the reference to his Benz and Volvo and LL Bean are annoying, and the description of details of which he was not a part makes me skeptical. I've always been fascinated by DID info, but other books I've read ring more true. I'm enjoying the reading, but I don't believe it...."
2,I liked it but I didn't,"This book is only interesting because of the subject. My apologies to Cameron West but he should have gotten someone else to write this book for him as I found his appalling writing constantly distracted me from his tale. However, fair play to him for having the courage to write it in the first place."
5,A Must Read,"Dr. West has provided an honest, insightful look into the life of DID. As you read this book, you will find yourself drawn into his story, wanting to savor every word of his experience. What a beautiful man to make himself vulnerable in front of the eyes of others. It is truly wonderful that Dr. West has found a vehicle for healing and sharing his pain, suffering, and ultimate redemption from the disruptive and chaotic world of DID. As you read this book, you will feel like you know him, all 24 of him. In the end, you will feel grateful that a man like this exists in our world today."
5,"Kudos to Cameron, et all !!","I throughly enjoyed this book. It was gripping. I couldn't put it down. I think it took courage, unbelivable strength and perseverance to complete such a novel. Cameron et all, thank you for allowing us, the readers, such an in depth look at and through your world. I have read several books about MPD and I will definately add this one to my list of favorites."
5,Best book I've read in years!,"I read this book as an assignment for my reading class in college. Granted, it wasn't my first choice, but I am glad to have read it. This is the first book I have read that really touched me. I found it profound the way West's wife, Rikki, pulled together, and stuck by her husband through the toughest of times. That's what love is all about. I really admire her courage. I would suggest that anyone who takes their life for granted, to read this book to find out what some of life's troubles are all about. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. I look forward to reading more material by Dr. West in the future!"
5,Fascinating and Inspiring!,"I bought Dr. West's book after seeing him on Oprah. I have always been fascinated by DID and was just blown away by his story. I was riveted from the first sentence. Oprah said it reads like a novel and she was right. The detail is amazing. At times I felt like I shouldn't be reading such intimate tales; like I was eavesdropping on a private conversation. I applaud Dr. West for having the courage to share his story. He has triumphed in a situation that would have crumbled most people. Although the road was rough, to say the least, he has come to grips with himself and all those that make him who he is. I am in awe of his determination and courage! Dr. West - I wish you peace and happiness and all the best to your family."
5,An amazing glimpse into the the brilliant mind of a survivor,"I could not put this book down! This book reads just like a novel! It is gripping at times, hilarious at times, moving most of the time, and just incredible and at times unbelieveable! It is amazing to learn the process involved when a person sustains severe, repeated abuse that the brain somehow manages to keep SANE by ""taking you to another place"" if you will in order to get through the episode of abuse and then to suppress those memories in order for you to live a normal life after this devastating abuse! I was truly amazed by this story! Very touched! Before I read it and before I saw Cam on Oprah, I had not idea how sane DID really is, that is is a disorder created by the brain to KEEP sane! Unvelieveable! I recommend this book very highly. It has taught me much. Enjoy! Jamie Smith, RN"
2,Could've been better,This book would have been good if you are into that type of thing. I personally didn't like it.
3,Interesting,"I liked this book, and his story of struggle is a good one to tell, but personally I wish the book had talked more about the problems of DID, his multiples, and go deeper into the cause of his DID, instead of his valiant struggle against not believing he had a problem."
1,shabby condition,Foolish on my part to order this book online. The copy is yellowish and brittle and very worn. After shipping costs I paid as much as I would have for a brand new copy. Live and learn!
3,"Interesting, but no new information on DID/MPD","Cameron West's autobiography is at times fascinating, but covers much of the same territory as most books about personal experience as a multiple and ends prematurely -- we never learn if he integrated his personalities successfully, for one thing. It is the only book I have seen by a man suffering from this disorder and also a married parent who has to deal with child-rearing and the strains to a marriage caused by the disorder. I hope the movie delves deeper and goes to the conclusion of West's story."
4,Brilliant insight,"I started reading this book the day it arrived. It was so engaging that I finished the book the same day I started it. I just couldn't put it down. As a person who is a survivor of trauma and also has the diagnosis of DID, this book was inspirational because it focuses on one fundamental problem that I knew was there...but haven't been able to put words on. The problem being, in the words of Dr. West, ""Denial's Rake"". Armed with this new and remarkable insight I believe that I have uncovered my first goal in therapy. I want to thank Dr. West and his family, his therapists and all of those who have helped put this book out there for all of us to read. I have found the hope we were looking for."
1,Why are you so seduced by this made-for-Oprah story?,"DID? Touching evocations of *24* personalities? Stop watching so much ""victim"" telvision, put your rational faculties in operation, and read Elaine Showalter. Maybe then you'll be able to resist the soon-to-come movie version of the heart-rending ""real-life story."" This is pure written-with-an-eye-toward-profit mass-market nonsense."
4,Riveting and Harrowing account,"A very harrowing account of what multiple personality disorder can do to a life, in addition to being a rather stunning portrait of what the human mind can be capable of. It also tells the story of his wife and child who try and cope with his disease. The book is occasionally melodramatic, especially the subplot about his worries of infidelity. While the writing can feel self conscious and some passages seem to be using words in a way to sound ""literary"", it is a riveting work and a quick read."
3,An average book on the topic.,"Though the book is interesting, it could have been more detailed on the authors struggles with his inner voices. Not so much family problems! Everybody has those."
3,"Who is so materialistic, Cam or an alter?","Fascinating story! However, it was too descriptive of clothes (brand names even), cars. household items, etc. Do we need to know that Rikki was wearing jumper, tights, turtleneck and matching socks? I skipped over many paragraphs to get to the heart of the book."
2,"multiple personalities, only two stars","as a reader who is just a reader, not someone experienced with this illness, my review should be read as such. there was more that i didn't like about this novel than i liked. i immediately draw offense at writers who describe everyone by their physical or material attributes (everyone wears brand names and is ""handsome""?? how beautiful must the US psychiatric scene be!! lucky everyone has a mercedes), and found the dialogue slow and, amazingly, the content simple. i would have liked to hear more in depth from the ""alters"" who particularly appealed to me such as Clay and Bart - maybe whole chapters so we could get a sense of them and how their lives were structured. maybe not possible? in short, multiple disappointments, as i read this book imagining the author (who is, coincidentally, ""handsome"") selling the film rights and talking about it to Oprah without knowing he'd actually done same. talk about mind-reading."
3,Not Wholly Convincing,"I'm a multiple, and while I realize the experience of every multiple will necessarily be unique, and the range of experiences are very wide, some of the stuff in this book just somehow didn't quite ring true to me. Maybe it was because events were condensed too much. For example, in the book, every time there was a switch, the author alleges that his body ""shuddered""...as in ""shudder, switch""...and I think there was even a ""shudder, poof"" in there. Neither my own experience nor other accounts I've read documents this sort of ""clean"" transition as happening all that consistently. I admire the author, and I believe him, but I think there are better and more convincing accounts. Try ""The Magic Daughter"" by Jane Phillips."
5,The most un-put-down-able book I've read in years,"I too, purchased Dr. West's book after seeing his interview on Oprah, and expected to feel somewhat let down after reading it. I didn't. Not only did I come away with a bone-numbing sense of sadness for the little boy that endured such atrocities, but I also was somewhat awed by Rikki's strength and courage. (Stand by your man, indeed...). The book is a fine testimony to the absolute strength and courage of the human spirit - Bravo to you and your guys, Dr. West."
4,the authorized biography,"Author Sara Corbett was granted exclusive access to the 1996 US women's basketball team, and this amounts to their authorized biography. Corbett is a good writer and manages to convey a series of themes: the tenuous existence of women's basketball in the US in 1995 when the team was formed, the heterogenous backgrounds of the players and coaches, the incipient rivalry between two nascent professional leagues for the allegiances of the players, to name a few. And Corbett is to be commended for managing to integrate this disparate material into a single narrative. But in basketball terms she is a ""homer"" -- and one wonders whether the exclusive access that she was given, implicitly or explicitly, informs this relentlessly positive depiction of the team. That said, it is probably a very good book for teenagers of either gender interested in basketball."
4,Yo-Yo Is One Of The Best!,"I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THIS ALBUM, BUT IT IS TIGHT. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE MACKSTRESS, 20 SACK, AND PASS IT ON. THE SONG WITH ICE CUBE IS TIGHT, TOO. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE LYRICS. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YO-YO FROM THE FISRT SONG ""YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH MY YO-YO""! IT'S GOOD. GO COP IT!"
3,Good content horrible construction,"This book was required for my English college class. The stories and content are great however the construction of the book is terrible. The pages are thinner than tissue paper. I was afraid I would rip a page if I turned it too quickly. Also, there's just over 3000 pages in this novel sized book. It's really thick and kind of awkward. It would have been better to have made it textbook sized then there would be less pages and it wouldn't be so massive. There's so many pages that the binding feels flimsy when you open it. Overall great book poor construction."
5,Truly a Masterpiece,This book truly does contain masterpieces of literature. The translations are accurate and readable. I have never enjoyed reading a collection of literature more.
3,NOT SURE,I BOUGHT THE DH5 THE OTHER DAY AND INSTALLED IT AND COULD NOT GET THE HAND CURSOR TO WORK. IT WOULD HARDLY MOVE. I HAVE A GREAT COMPUTER SO IT SHOULD HAVE WORKED. IF I AM GOING TO BUY A GAME I DON'T WANT GLINCHES IN IT. WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE AND SEE HOW THAT ONE WORKS MAYBE THE FIRST ONE WAS JUST A BAD SOFTWARE.
5,This game is the bomb!,I know the maker of this game and he let me try a version of it and it kicks! I highly recommend this game to anyone who has liked any of the other Deer Hunter games!
3,Fun yet glitchy,i bought this game 2 months ago i installed it in 2 minutes very fast. the graphics are nice the sound is great the gameplay is decent but the game is overall GLITCHY all the time
1,DOSE NOT WORK ON DELL COMPUTERS,DOSNT WORK ON ANY DELL COMPUTER OR AT ALL OR LAPTOPSALL THE OTHER DEER HUNTER GAMES WORK BUT NOT THISIT LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING TO WORK TO BEGIN AND THEN IT JUSTSTOP.IF YOU HAVE A DELL DONT BUY THIS GAME
1,WILL NOT WORK,It will not run on the Dell computers. It would not run after loading and it just freezes up or goes back to the front page of my computer.I have a 400 dimension XPS R400. My brother in law bought the deer hunter 5 also and it would not run on his 450 machine and he tried it on his 933mhz machine and it would not run on that one either and that is a new machine. I have not been able to run the game yet. Never had any problems with the other deer hunter games.
5,Excellent Book!,"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in graphology. It's basic and easy to read and understand with a lot of practical examples and exercises. The author keeps an upbeat writing style throughout the book, keeping it from being dry or text-bookish.I would recommend handwriting analysis for anyone interested in people...it provides unique insight on a persons' personality or habits. It's really quite fascinating."
5,Handwriting Analysis: Putting It to Work for You,"Clear, concise, interesting and very useful. I already have some knowledge of handwriting analysis and found it very easy to learn more."
2,Not subjective,"Most of the content was interesting and probably correct. I am not an expert but I felt a very strong personal influence affecting her analysis, which damages her credibility. But it was interesting. It was obvious if she didn't like the person how she observed the writing characteristics vs if she did like the person."
5,"Quick, fun, informative book",This book offers a quick look at how to analyze handwriting. The quizzes help to engage the reader in the analysis of the handwriting instead of using prose to simply explain the concepts. I found myself analyzing handwriting for fun within a few days.
5,This book is GREAT,"Really good book, made easy to understand plusthe author shows that Graphology is a science.Not something in the occult genreGREAT"
5,I highly recommend this book for new students...,"This is a very ""easy read"". The concepts and ideas are laid out in an easy to understand format. I loved the quiz at the beginning of the chapters. I mainly bought this book for the celebrity and criminal handwriting samples, but there are lots of samples to study. This is an excellent book for beginners looking to get a taste of this wonderful art. I only wish I had known about this years ago when I got startet in graphology."
4,each page has so much to offer,Great book full of helpful information/ I've barely had a chance to really go throught the entire book. Thanks for the quick service
2,okay as an introduction,"Readable and entertaining, but not especially useful as a reference. She makes graphology seem much simpler than it really is--simplistic, even--making blanket statements about certain handwriting traits without explaining how other traits can modify their meanings. (If everything she says is right, my sister probably is a criminal and my husband is a bomb just waiting to explode...) It's entertaining enough to make a good introduction to the subject, but I don't recommend it to anyone who already knows anything about the subject."
2,Snow is no Vanilla Ice,".... .... Informer is a pretty good song (although I can't understand what Snow is saying), but the rest of the album is weak. Although I think ""Informer"" is a decent song, it will be almost completely forgotten within the next 10 years.What's with the name ""Snow""? He's blatantly copying Vanilla Ice. The Ice man has a ""cool"" name, so Snow took a similar ""cold"" name. He should have simply called himself Vanilla Ice #2, because that's what he really wishes he was. Suggestions for better names include Liquid Paper, Ghost and Chalk-Boy.If you really want to buy a CD by a white rapper, buy To The Extreme by Vanilla Ice."
1,12 inches of bullsh*t,"""Snow"" is a joke. First of all, he pretends to be a big black Jamacian, but he's actually pure whitebread. Snow, your photo on the cover of the album tipped us off, buddy. Plus, there aren't many black Jamacian rastamen that sing soprano. We know you ain't black.Here's a blurb from his official site ([...])...""He [Snow] remains proud of what he considers the product of multi-cultural Toronto: Jamaican dancehall and American R&B; filtered through an Irish kid who jokes that his only excuse for not ""going country"" is that he's yet to find a pair of cowboy boots he doesn't hate.""Uh Oh. Watch out, 'cause Snow is about to get his glock."
5,snow,this cd is one of my favorites. i request it to all who haven't heard it. it's great to dance to:) informer is one of the best songs i have ever heard.
2,"Come on now people, There's only 2 listenable songs here!","Come on now people, There's only 2 listenable songs here! Snow bites it and bites it hard."
2,Ummmm,"Snow may have decent beats but he should stop trying to pretend that he speaks Jamaican. In his sing,""Informer"" he uses the word ""dibby-dibby"" (""My dibby-dibby girl...""). Dibby-dibby means worthless. That's basically dissing his girlfriend and he doesn't even know it. LOL"
2,Newer edition available,The third edition of the wildlife damage inspection handbook is now available. It is thoroughly updated and expanded. It is also in full color.
5,If you want to FEEL different -then do the Process!,"I did the Hoffman Process almost three years ago and have referred many people to it since then. I can, with an open heart, honestly say that doing the Process was the biggest gift I could have ever given myself, my parents and all the people I love. If you have a voice within that is searching for something and you just don't know what it is -then consider the Process. The only way I can describe it is as the imperative missing link to the million piece puzzle that made up me and my life. The Process is loving and very powerful and was the key to organic lasting change for me."
2,You get what you pay for,"This will get the job done, but just barely. You have to hold the tuner right up to about an inch away from the strings to get it to register (unless you use a pick, and then you can back it off a little.) Either way, it was awkward to use. (By the way, I have a six string acoustic) Also, the bottom E string for some reason is very difficult to tune. No matter how hard I pluck it, it only registers about one third of the time. Other reviewers have liked it, so maybe I just got a bad one. My seller was nice about it when I called and they offered to replace it, but it wasn't worth the cost of shipping back. I'll keep it as a backup or use when I'm traveling. (Like I said, it will get the job done, it's just a bit frustrating to use.) Sorry I don't have another tuner to recommend to anyone yet. I suggest you pass on this model though."
1,What A Bargain!,"Don't waste your money on those fancy smancy tuners with all the extras. The Qwik Tune is simple, easy and fast! The best for your value and also the quickest and easiest to use. Push the button it's on and tuning. Push the button again and it's off. What else do you need?"
3,Improvisatory music,"One of two AMM recordings that seem to be oddities in their discography (the other being 'To Hear and Back Again' w/ the duo of Prevost and saxophonist Lou Gare). The lineup here only consists of Prevost and Rowe. Rowe is playing mostly conventional electric guitar here in a very rocking improv mood(perhaps due to that he was a part of Trevor Watt's Amalagam rock/jazz group at the time) however there are areas with various prepared techniques and the transistor radio (a broadcast fragment states the title of this recording). Both players are still quite great here, yet it doesn't quite stack up to other recordings in the AMM catalog. Rowe's playing seems to draw-up to the same lineage to the likes of Derek Bailey, Sonny Sharrock & Ray Russell, where otherwise his playing remained unique free from any sort of reference to the traditional guitar playing. With all that it is still a very worthwhile recording to find..."
4,Good Job,"I just read ""A Dark and Bloody Ground"" about the same battle and it made me get out this book, which I had read years ago. I think I like Follow Me better. It goes into a little more narrative detail and the maps are better. I also got a better feeling for the battle, and especially General Coda's incredable mistakes in this book than the newer work. Both are good but I think this one is a tad better written."
3,Good product but eats up batteries.,"It's great when it's running, but it uses up the batteries. I have to replace the batteries every week. And of course you cannot use an AC adaptor with it."
1,Cracked screen,My son made good use of it for the semester until the screen cracked. He had it in his backpack. Even the separate compartment did not help it survive against the heavy textbooks. He asked for another one but I am hesitating because of the cost for such a short life.
2,decent,"I was not please with this dic-thes. at all. I needed this device for college and was quick to discover there are several words it did not contain in its ""extensive"" memory. I also recommend you guys to get a dictionary-thesaurus' with larger buttons. I didn't realize just how small the buttons are, and I'm a girl. I can just imagine a boy trying to type in a word in this thing. The ones with bigger buttons are not but one inch bigger than this one, so the claims of this being ""compact"" and perfect for school is unnecessary. This is not one to buy..."
5,Balancing the ratings - Up/Down scroll exists and works well,"I tutored a 9th grader who owned this model. When I first tried to look up a word and needed to scroll down I couldn't figure it out, but that was with no manual and 2 minutes of examination. Shortly after that I purchased the Spanish English version by Franklin for myself - exact same layout - I READ the MANUAL - the up down scroll is on the side of the unit - left of the screen - not on the keyboard portion of the Spanish/English one. That scroll button is quite functional. Don't let the previous review dissuade you from purchasing this item. The only thing I can say about it is that with only 100,000 words its use becomes less valuable the older you are and the greater your vocabulary - you have to remember that the words a, the, an, it, he, she, etc. are part of that 100k. Would definitely recommend to high school students and below. Hope that helps."
1,I don't know if the dictionary is any good...,"...because it broke before I really had a chance to use it. I bought this dictionary to use at school, but it didn't even last a day in my backpack. The screen cracked beyond repair, and the plastic cover did nothing to protect it. My sister had one of these too, and she had the same problem. If it can't last in any place where it might get banged around a bit, it's not very durable.A person mentioned that it doesn't have scroll buttons. It does have scroll buttons, but I had difficulty finding them because they're on the side, not where the instructions booklet said they are. When I did find them, they were somewhat difficult to use because they're hard to press.Maybe the dictionary is good, but if you plan on carrying this around with you, I don't recommend it."
2,MIMMY AND SOPHIE ALL AROUND THE TOWN,"i purchased this title soley upon a review. not only was it not interesting enough to keep my kids attention, i found that it was not well written. my kids are 4 1/2 and 6."
5,"Great singer, Great box set!!!!",There isn't much more to say that hasn't already been said. This is a great box set of hard to find tracks by one great singer!
2,Item Not In Good Condition - Bad Rating,This book appeared to be in good condition but on arrival I noted that it was full of cross-outs and notes written on many many pages. This vendor did not rate this book correctly or simply did not look at the contents to see what condition the book was really in.
1,Gnonsense,"If you're looking for a good laugh, this particular book of Samael's (born Victor Manuel Gomez Rodriguez) is as good a place as any to start. However, some of his more regular disciples may be disappointed to learn that it contains none of his hilarious 'wisdom' concerning the Little Blue Men from Mars who live in an underground city at the South Pole (as outlined in 'Cosmic Spaceships').The predictable string of 5-star reviews below, clearly submitted by members of Victor's 'Gnostic' cult, should be taken with a large pinch of salt. An active critical faculty is not particulalry valued within this cult; in fact it is systematically discouraged.I note with some satisfaction (although with no great surprise) that this is the only book of Victor's currently in print. This is no more than this fraudulent egomaniac deserves."
5,Esoteric Alchemical Work,"This book will inform you on alchemical knowledge. Founder of The Gnostic Movement from the 50's, Samael dedicated his life to delivering humanity the secret keys to liberation based on his direct investigations and experience, and one of them is explained in this work. A must for every seeker of wisdom and truth."
4,Excellent,"Very well written book and fascinating world. The characters were excellent as well- all in all, a very good start to the Buenaventure story line!"
4,A great dry good for puppies,"Fairly digestible and made with natural ingredients which is great for dogs with delicate stomachs. Almost anything else gives my puppy diarrhea, so this is great!"
1,Try the Large Breed version instead,"I was usingChicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Puppy, Large Breed Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag, which was an excellent product. Switched to this because the Large Breed version was out of stock. It's been terrible- loose stools as soon as my puppy started eating this. Stick to the Large Breed version. Avoid this one."
2,Watch out for exhorbitant shipping charges,Ordered a 35 pound bag and they tacked on $22 for shipping! Shipping was advertised as free. Won't let me cancel. Buyer beware!
1,My dog hates it.,My 6 month old long haired toy Datson will not eat this unless I hand feed it to him. It gives him diarrhea. Now I am stuck with 35 pounds of it.
4,Power latin music!,"If you are looking for good latin rock or latin alternative music, this is one CD that you have to buy."
1,Pseudo-intellectuals will love it!,"Where does one begin? It's beyond bad. Has a patina of importance, but only that. Worth reading only out of a sense of perversity."
3,left coast tree-huggers?,"No comments on the book per se, but note that the ""mystical crackpot"" contingent (right or wrong) is NOT from California and that the ""rational common-sense"" contingent largely IS Californian. There's more rationality out here than people think!"
4,Midway: A historical novel,"I very much enjoyed the book. It was one of intensity at times and one that was able to take you back 60+ years into the ready room. You could smell the smells and feel the tension.I didn't particularly like the use of profanity, graphic at times, when referring to his times with Claire. Sure, they may have thought or spoke that way back then but save the 4-letter words for the smut novels. Thought that detracted from the class of the story, I was still able to enjoy the rest of the book, just skipping past any of the love life.I would have preferred the use of real names as they dealt with the real characters. Other historical novels have successfully done this; Gods and Generals, Killer Angels.It's an easy read that keeps you drawn in and educates you at the same time. If not for the unnecessary profanity, I would share the novel with my 13 year old."
2,Not for heavy duty use.,I bought this unit for clean up while building a new house. With the rainy autumn I put the pumping function to some serious use pumping rain from the basement.I think the switch that detects a full tub was malfunctioning. The unit just kept shutting down for no reason. Even when the tub wasn't full.Then one day while sucking up some water on the floor the motor burned up (as evidenced by that familiar electrical smoke smell)!Got it fixed locally under warrenty but still have the problem with the unit shutting down/not wanting to run some time.Evidently Shop-Vac hasn't got the bugs worked out of the new features.Disappointed.
4,Pond sucker,"I bought it to suck debris from the bottom of our pond. It does OK, but will often stop b/c it cannot pump the water out as fast as it sucks it in. Perhaps the algae and junk in the tank make it harder to pump out the water. It can suck up a fair amount of algae, leaves, etc, but it is not an industrial size motor.As a vacuum (dry) it does fine.It's good."
1,Dead after assembly -- updated,"Ordered this heavy-duty unit after torrential rains overwhelmed my consumer-grade unit. Confronted with world's worst instructions -- apparent attempt to cram multi-lingual instructions onto a single sheet of paper. After finally getting the beast assembled, pushed the switch to test it out and ... nothing. Switch seems to be faulty, but Shop-Vac customer service says to return the entire unit to seller.Will update this review if I ever get satisfaction.Wish I could change my rating to 3 stars. Shop-Vac came through with a new power unit to replace the one with a faulty switch.The instructions still suck."
1,doesn't work,"I have had this vacuum cleaner for several years and decided to try the water pumping feature. Well, I hooked up a hose to the connection and nothing happens. It just fills up the tank and shuts off when full. So to final-empty the water bed I have to roll 7 tubs of water at 100# each over to the bathtub. Fun. By the way, the wheels are skinny, slick and useless so you basically have to pick up the thing to roll it - great for your back! Regardless the wheels will scratch and track all over your floor. The Shop Vac website contains no useful information other than a soundless demo of a guy pumping water from a pool, applying an attachment to the inside of the unit that it did not come with!"
4,Excellent addition to students of Gettysburg campaign.,"This book is a superb addition to students of the Gettysburg Campaign as well as those of Lee's army. It details the Confederate order of battle on the first day of the great Pennsylvania battle. If one is seeking a more dramatic,enlarged account of the first day they might look elswhere. This book however is best suited for those of us that seek sterile details such as unit strengths, and individual company names of individual units(although not complete).The text is well written and informative. There are photos of the brigade commanders,color drawings of many of the unit flags and good maps. A minor mistake was in identifying a photo of Brig.General McGowan as that of Brig.General Iverson. This however is tiny flaw in a book filled with the minute detail many of us hunger for when it comes to that vaunted American Army..the Army of Northern Virginia."
3,Not to bad!!,"I downloaded the demo and it plays like most of the other war themed games from infogames. Like Deadly Dozen, it is a good game for the price."
5,Amazing!,"Since I turned vegetarian last June and finally vegan in August, I missed chicken soup, so I decided to give this a try. Well I was actually shocked at how good it is. Incredibly delicious! Thank you Amy's. I'm going be buying this often. One of the best soups I've ever eaten!"
4,Not quite Campbell's but is as close as I can find,"Often when we are sick, we seem to revert to our childhood. We didn't have many packaged/processed foods growing up but one thing we had was Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup when we were sick and didn't feel like eating anything else.I had a nasty sickness at the beginning of the year and for the first time in many, many years, I craved the overly salty, processed Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup. A friend recommended Amy's No Chicken Noodle soup.The taste is a bit off but I found an easy fix for it. Add a can of Amy's No Chicken Noodle soup, add a can of water and add a little of the Better than Bouillon Unchicken broth, heat and serve. It is as close as a vegetarian is going to get to Campbell's I think."
2,bentcans,7cans were bent and 2cans were bent so badly that they had to be thrown away packing was not good.
1,Slightly sweet,I was looking forward to this soup. It turned out I didn't like it. It was slightly sweet and mostly bland. It had a taste I didn't enjoy. I will not be purchasing this soup again. I don't like my noodle soup to taste sweet.
3,Not my most favorable soupy,"I really like Amy's product line, but this is not my go to soups, but its OK. I put a little garlic powder on top and some cracked pepper. Its good to have in the cupboard for variety, but I always say ""Oh, man ..."" when I grab it."
2,Has a Weird Wang,I'm glad I only bought one can. The noodles are soggy and the broth has a weird flavor. I don't hate it but I won't be buying it again either. I'll be making my own unchicken noodle soup.
5,Deeelicoussssss,This stuff is the best!! We just love it. I think you should try it and you too will love it!!
1,Vomit in a can,"I tried this soup when I was sick. I followed all directions on can, just heat n eat. It tasted and smelled AWFUL! I took one spoonful before having to spit it back out. I even checked the can to make sure it wasn't expired, but it was still good according to the date on the can.I would just make some vegetarian ""chicken"" noodle soup at home. Cube some tofu, throw in some noodles, onions, nutritional yeast, etc. Much tastier."
3,Great game,It's a really good game but if you have a newer computer the software isn't compatible so I had to bye a 64-bit version that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars
2,"Pretty photos, not much information","This is basicallly a photo book on blue glass. It has no information on the manufacturing process, the difference between blown, cut and formed glass or particular glass vendors. The photos have prices associated with them, but no dates of manufacture. It is the only thing out there exclusively devoted to ""cobalt blue"", but I was disappointed in the lack of information. The authors seemed more interested in attributing the ownership of the items depicted in the photos than in providing facts."
4,A hard to find resource for a popular collectible item.,This is the only book that I've found on this subject and it is in my favorite format for pricing collectibles (lots of color pictures and pricing with the pictures). Have discovered that I have probably been selling too low. No wonder I have immediate sales.
5,Great Music - CHEAP,"When I bought this CD in a thrift store, I really did NOT know what to expect. I had never heard of ""Comedia Veneziana."" In fact, I wasn't even certain this was the artist OR the name of the CD! Similarly, looking at the track titles, I only recognized a few pieces. Most are composed or arranged by someone named ""Bodi"" who, I assume, is the conductor of this group.I put it in my player and was blown away by the quality of the sound, the wonderful arrangements and the selections.If you like ""easy listening"" music or somewhat modernized versions of classical tunes, this CD is for YOU."
1,very low budget,"The movie was filmed in and around Melissa Wolf's home, but the lighting was dark on every ""dream"" sequence making it hard to see. Those are over half the movie."
2,Made from VHS tape (terrible tracking),"Should have been MUCH better! Glori-Anne and Melissa deservedbetter treatment than this VHS-to-DVD transfer. The picturequality was grainy (especially in the black/white sequences).Somebody should have adjusted the tracking on the VHS player!On the other hand, the still photos were very good."
4,Good for the money,"For the price, this battery works very well. It doesnt last as long as my Nikon branded battery, but for the price you can buy at least 5 of these before you buy 1 Nikon one. Still, one of these generally last a whole day of shooting."
2,Dissapointed,I hadnt gotten around to have this replaced since ive been using my canon camera. It charges on the awesome charger but it just wont work. I wonder what could be the problem. Maybe its just a defected battery.
3,Jury's out...,"I bought a couple of these batteries because they were stunningly inexpensive. Now, I'm not so sure they're a bargain. The first time I used one, I shot maybe 80 frames and the battery was already out of power. I'll see how things go, but the jury is out on this, and I need more testing . Maybe you do get what you pay for - my Nikon batteries are super tough, but much more costly."
3,"Well researched, honorable effort","Although historical fiction, the author has done her research most commendably on real life trapper and western explorer Andrew Henry. With only scant first hand knowledge of this legendary frontiersman, Margaret Hawkes Lindsley breathes life into Major Henry and all the people in his immediate circle of the early 1800's.While not claiming to be much of an historical fiction devotee myself, possibly due to the copiousness of literary ""fluff"" so characteristic of fiction, and this book is no exception, fictionalization can and does somewhat hamper the flow rate of a smooth and purposeful read.Overall, an insightful novel of a true to life pioneer of the fur trade era."
4,Graffiti Lives O.K. by Nigel Rees,"The emphasis in this collection is on the humorous, but sexual, political and literary graffiti have been given a degree of permanence by their inclusion. The urge to scribble on walls is universal and the sites for graffiti writers represented here range from the Bodleian Library via Alaska to the ladies in Chorlton-cum-Hardy"
2,general information but ok,"I tried this guidebook and found the information to be quite superficial-lives up to its name. The list of 'not to be missed' places was good and I followed these up but I would have liked something with a little more depth, it all read a bit too much like a travel brochure for me."
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped,"This was the only electronic guidebook I could find on this area, but it wasn't particularly helpful. Perhaps the print version has an index, but the lack of one was a real hindrance. At least, I couldn't locate an index, but then this was the first e-book I have ever used."
5,Rainbow E Canister Vacuum Cleaner,I am very pleased with the Rainbow vacuum and the service I have received from the vendor. This is my second Rainbow. I had another brand between them and do not intend to ever change again. The vacuum is not lightweight but it is great knowing the dirt and dust vacuumed is trapped in water and no longer in my house. The air in my home feels so much better and has certainly helped with my allergies. Great product
1,No stamina!!,"The TILIA VAC 1505 is our second Foodsver...and we thought we were ""upgrading""! We use the vac to store everything from rice..to homemade meatballs to bird seed for our exotic birds. Little did we know this machine would give out in six months! Be sure to save your receipt! We were out of luck!!"
5,Kanguru FC RW replaces lap top,I wrote the original review and I must say that this product lives up to the specs. It exceeded my expectations. It accepts 110 thru 240 volts as input so all you need is a converter plug for the foreign country. I only had a bit of a problem in England with the Langham Hilton in London; their plug was not standard GB plug that is provided by converters BUT they did have 110 volt outlet for laptop (American businessmen) and it worked flawlessly thru England and cruiseship offshore Normandy. I was so impressed - it is the simplest gadget to use and everybody who has a digital camera and lugs a laptop around to write the photos really needs this gadget! I will never be without it.Good luck
5,Kanguru Standalone CD Burner replaces lap top,"I am going to Europe and wanted to take my digital camera. In order to do this and not take a lap-top with me, I needed a device to allow for copying of photos from SD card to CD. I saw this on PC Connection first and ordered it. First time out of the box at home (in Florida) it WORKED. I was amazed to see how fast it wrote the CD and now I am freed from both film and my laptop. No longer have to lug the boat anchor with me and I don't have to buy many 256Mb SD cards. Thanks to Kanguru."
4,"Quality tire, But even the best price around doesn't make it cheap.","I am still not sure why a motorcycle tire costs about twice as much per pound as the equivalent automotive tire, but it does.I am happy with the tire. It give good grip in even wet pavement. I don't do endos and such so I cant testify to its ability to give that kind of grip or stability, but it does what I ask of it just fine."
5,Back Saver,I'm a locomotive Engineer and this cushion is nothing short of a miracle. Locomotive seats are mounted directly to steel and offer very little cushion on rough track. Harmonic vibration is reduced to almost nothing. This make 12+ hours of sitting and stairing straight ahead much more confortable.
5,Works as intended,Excellent when sitting for long periods. I use it for 4 hour sweat lodges when sitting on the ground. I made cases of large towels so it could be washed easily. The adjust ability of air allows comfort. Good choice.
4,helped,"This product was recommended to my husband by his doctor for his rear end. He sits for long periods of time in front of the computer and his rear end just hurts. He says it has been very helpful and he can sit more comfortably now. Also stretching the back muscles has been helpful. Although he can sit comfortably for a period of time, he cannot sit for extended periods. I think the human body needs to move. Some of us have an inner sense that we need to get up so we never sit so long that it starts to hurt."
4,A blessing,A must have for invalid patients! Fits perfect in a wheelchair and the comfort factor is over the top.Has truly helped with pressure spots and given great relief and peace of mind.
5,Roho LTV Seat Cushion,"This is my second LTV, one for each car. Purchased both recently. Don't think there's a better cushion made. Also have the one made for motorcycles. Very satisfied with all. I've worked in the hospital arena 40+ years, so I'm very familiar with Roho's excellent quality."
4,Funny and fast paced,"This is the first novel by Sharon Dunn that I've read, and I enjoyed it a lot. The characters were full-dimensional and the plot was well-paced. I laughed out loud more than once, not always appreciated by my husband when I'm reading in bed late at night."
4,The best strip the Washington Post doesn't publish,"Foxtrot is probably the best comic strip that the Post doesn't get, though unfortunately these days that's not saying an awful lot. It's not intended to be damning with faint praise; in fact, it may be the best comic strip going, period. It's certainly up there. I particularly like Jason and his sci-fi enthusiasms. Amend also does a good job showing realistic computer language when that's called for. (When Dad asks for Java, that's exactly what Jason provides.)"
5,ENTERTAINING,wonderful. i laughed so hard my stomach hurt.a sure 10. you really should read this book. my whole family enjoyed it
3,The decline of the West continues,"This latest collection of Foxtrot comic strips is an inspiring testimony to the triumph of the human spirit in overcoming obstacles such as an utter lack of talent or originality and achieving the sort of success that can measured solely in dollars. Like a traffic accident involving sideshow freaks, this strip is impossible to ignore each morning, despite the pall it casts over my Grapenuts and toast. Now with the publication of this book, I can perform the literary equivalent of picking at a scab during every meal, and snacktime too."
2,"oh, please...","Salvation! After almost giving up hope, I finally find a review that recognizes the sheer mediocrity of this entire venture. I won't deny taking a certain guilty pleasure in reading FT, but viewed objectively they're fairly appalling. I mean, my God, it's the exact same repetitive jokes day after day after day after day after day! Every single one of Amend's characters exactly fits into a rigid stereotype from which he or she never, ever, deviates in the slightest. ""I say, I wonder what those lovable Foxtrot rascals are up to today! My word, it looks like the small, hyperactive child is equating his vacuous valley girl sister to a repulsive beast! Well, I declare! What a strikingly original development! What will that genius Amend think of next?"" How come great comic strips like Calvin and Hobbes die and things like Foxtrot drag their decaying corpses onwards 'til the end of time?"
5,The Alegre All Stars' best from 1960-66.,"The Alegre All Stars were the famed Alegre label's house band and this compilation brings you their best tracks. Charlie Palmieri, Johnny Pacheco, Kako, Bobby Rodriguez and other legendary Salsa musicians played key roles in their productions. In many ways, the Alegre All Stars paved the way and set the stage for what the Fania All Stars would accomplish during the '70s--and their music has not lost its vitality, freshness, relevance or verve. Classic 1960s New York ""Salsa Dura"" at its very best!"
5,subtropical fruit for third world country's information,"This book has informatiom for the professional as well as the village farmer in Africa , its teachings are simple and clear for all those interested in the subject to follow , the illustrations and instructions are simple even for those with a basic knowledge of subtropical fruit growing. Africa is not covered in the distribution map never the less the fruits are for example the mango tree is synonymous with Africa , it gives food, and shelter from the elements and fuel what more can you want from a tree. Every African school would benefit from a book like this , and i know one that will."
3,"Great pictures, but could have been better","The book is attractive and does contain a lot of information about different citrus varieties. My main criticism is that the Planting and Care section could have been much more substantial. Specifically, since the descriptions of various citrus ailments (poor nutrition, inappropriate watering, infection with pests) are not accompanied by photos of the symptoms, it makes it harder for the reader to figure out what these problems might actually look like. The black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings of pests are somewhat informative, but they're very limited compared to what might be conveyed by a photo.Also, a few diagrams to help illustrate ""good pruning"" would have been great.I'm not suggesting that this book should have been a definitive technical treatise on citrus, but I think it would have been more useful if more attention had been paid to what goes wrong when you're trying to grow citrus."
3,Not so complete,"I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with the the book. It claims to be a ""Complete Guide to Selecting and Growing Citrus"", but it is very far from being complete. It does a good job of describing the varieties and their climatological preferances, but very poor on maintenance, pest control, etc. To suggest that if you keep you plants healthy you will not have pest problems is a bit like suggesting that if you eat healty foods you will never have heart disease, cholesterol or high blood pressure.I learned a few things from reading it (which I why I didnt give it a more negative review), but I wish it payed more attention to factors beyond selecting sensible choices for our Florida home."
3,citrus,Book is ok but not enough varities and lacking in detail. I would recommend for basic information on citrus but not if want much detail
3,Sing and Read,"I was a little disappointed because I thought the books came with the CD, especially since the cover of the CD says, ""Sing & Read"" with frog Street's Shape Book or Color Books."
2,Don't waste your time.,I watched this movie for one reason Colin Farrell. With out him I would have given it only one star. Crummy plot and actors that speak in such thick British accents that you can not understand the dialog with out the subtitles. Hated the ending. Wasted 2 hours of my life on this one.
3,"All the components, none of the thrill and Farrell looks good in a suit.","Great soundtrack! Fantastic actors. Dayum, Farrell looks good in a suit. But aside from that, meh. It's just not really cohesive. Farrell's character wants to go straight yet he's the most violent of all the players and I didn't feel it was because he needed to be. And others are correct about the accents. If you watch it, just to see Colin in a suit, of course, have the subtitles on. It was a disappointment but man, Farrell looks good in a suit. Two stars for the movie, three stars for the suit, four for the soundtrack. Averages a three rating."
3,Not Bad...Not Great...A little better than Average,"This flick is alright, I thought it would be better, Cast does a good job...not 100% sure what I didn't like about it...Guess when I get these London crime movies I'm expecting ""LOCK, STOCK"", ""SNATCH"", or ""ROCKNROLLA"", or even ""LAYER CAKE""...those I really enjoy, so I guess my expectations are just too high going in...this is not bad, not great, a little better than average but one thing is for sure....LONDON BLVD can't hold a candle to those Guy Ritchie flicks or even LAYER CAKE in my opinion, so to give 5 stars is just WAY too much. 3 and 1/2 stars for me!So if u like those other four films a lot that I mentioned earlier, you'll probably be disappointed with this one...but this is as good or better than another one I kind of enjoyed, IN BRUGES. Definitely entertaining enough to watch again though!"
4,Very entertaining,"If you like movies like Snatch, In Bruges and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells be sure to check this one out too. Both lead characters turn in excellent performances."
2,In Need of a Better Ending,"The actors played their characters well. Notable character performance by Ben Chaplin. Olivia Lovibond was a nice eye-candy at the beginning of the movie.Colin plays the lead character whom struggles to get his life together again after serving prison time. The movie seemed to emphasize more on the dark-side of human nature and not enough on redemption and change for the better good.On a side note, I did hope for a severe punishment for the duo-gangster-teenagers but was totally dissappointed at the end of the movie.Colin's character (Mitchel) should have continued-on but the creators of this movie are too engross in the era of 'the Departed', 'Gangs of New York'. The movie would have been better in the hands of Guy Ritchie."
1,Blu-Ray Review,What garbage of a movie. The Soundtrack is nice but that's about all. The rest is a total waste of time.
1,Don't see this!!!,"I hated this movie; thought it was ridiculous, especially its ending. It left me thinking I'd wasted 2 hours of my life. I didn't see the point to this movie and keep waiting for more...only for the movie to end without any climax. Don't see this!!!"
1,Great cast,"Ok......this movie was a complete waste of time. Don't watch it, you will be sorry. Colin Farrell was sexy and I loved to watch him walk.....haha.....that was about all the enjoyment I got out of this horrible movie. Not only was it a ""what?"" storyline, I couldn't understand a bloody word they said half the time. I understand this was a gangster movie but, f--- this and f--- that everyother word???---not so much. Horribly done.....and I am with the other review that was just glad it was over, even though he dies in the end."
5,QUIRKY and Very different,I read many of the reviews and was almost turned off to see this movie - but VERY glad that i did after all.It's NOT your run of the mill story or plot - but i enjoyed it thoroughly.Dont miss it as you will be glad you watched it through!Kal~
1,For once the critics were correct,"It seems to me they left out the plot to this movie. Most of the characters are cardboard, things happen that are meant to ""ironic"" but which really were just the directory/writer trying to write themselves out of corner. The ending was very unsatisfying, and came on like they had forgotten about it and then realized they were almost out of film. You'd think that with the people involved it could have been interesting."
3,A good entertainment with a long-winded ending.,"Three stars for this--my first--Edgar Wallace book. It was a good story, for the most part, or else I would not have finished it. Clever plot and dialogue. An entertaining read, but an overblown, long-winded ending that got too long. Perhaps I will read some more Wallace mysteries, hoping he cleans up his endings a little. At least they're free on Kindle!"
2,Weaker Wallace,"Mystery writer is manipulated by Evil Foreigner into murder: he's sentenced to prison but his best friend, a brilliant police investigator, is on the case. Not bad setup and the villain is a lot of fun -- he does just about everything except curl his mustaches. Unfortunately it feels as though Wallace was truly making this one up as he went along: what starts out as a ""unjust man sentenced to prison"" story suddenly changes channels (and protagonists!) into a ""arch criminal versus brilliant investigator"" story, and just as that's starting to catch fire it shifts *again* to a whodunit (and not a very good one, incidentally, mysteries as such were not Wallace's strength). As such, this can't be considered one of the better Wallaces, while he always sort of ""made it up as he went along"", his best books cohere a lot better than this one."
5,A required read for those missions focused,"I have not finished it yet, but each chapter builds the case for how to be effective in cross cultural settings. I would recommend this book as required reading to all who are going as short-term or long-term missionaries."
4,Cross-cultural Servanthood: Serving the World in Christlike Humility,"This is a great book for those of us that believe we have the whole world figured out. The chapter on Humility is alone worth the price of the book. Great for anyone desiring to serve skillfully in culturally unfamiliar settings, whether in the United States or abroad."
5,Outstanding!,Had a PEG-760C since December '01 and loved it until the battery would no longer hold a charge and I kept losing data. Just took it in to Best Buy where I had purchased it along with a 3 year warranty. They said it would have to go back to Sony and I could have a new one in its place. So... I asked if I could upgrade to the NR70V/U and pay the difference & they said YES! This thing is amazing! The screen is much brighter and the case and built in keyboard are so perfectly designed. Can't believe they made such a quantum leap in just a few months. SONY RULES! And Best Buy's warranty/exchange was the easiest transaction I've ever made.
4,sony...bony,IT's a great advance in technology on Sony's part. It's gonna come in very handy at work. But I wear surgical scrubs all day. Where is the belt clip and case!!!! Sony-- get on the ball and get this out!!
2,Looks are not everything,"Buggy system and desktop software. Crashes during initial synch.When powered up provides a message that is cannot find a serial driver and lists the filename and line number. requires subsequent reboot.Will crash with a ""fatal"" error at least once during use.Battery life is rather short.Need a memory stick for MP3.Sony specific Palm os required. Some older apps will not run on it.Looks great but not ready for prime time. I should have purchased a Palm."
1,Very little information about corals!,"Having purchased Green and Short's ""World Atlas of Seagrasses"", also from California Press, I was quite excited to find this volume. Green and Short describe nearly all of the world's seagrasses, complete with line drawings and species comparisons, and map their distribution. They also include info on preservation, destruction, etc. It is an invaluable resource for anyone needing to identify or locate seagrasses. I was disappointed, however, when I received ""World Atlas of Coral Reefs"". The entire text is devoted to describing areas where reefs are found, but rarely mentions anything about the corals themselves! I saw <Diadema> listed more often than any coral genus! If you want to learn about the per capita fish consumption of Mauritius or phosphate mining on the atoll of Nauru, this is the book for you. If, however, you are interested in corals and the reefs that they construct (which is probably why you are reading this) you should move on to another book."
5,World Atals of Coral reefs,"Whether you teach marine biology or are planning the long-awaited diving trip to a tropical location, this book is the comprehensive guide to coral reefs world-wide. For each area, information is provided on locations of reefs with special reference to threats to their survival. This is not a species identification guide but rather an ecological treatment. The book is most suited to the reader who already has some knowledge of the biology of corals."
2,Book should be called Path of Savitir not the Mother,"Having seen Amritanandamayi (Ammachi) every year since 1987, I found this book to be disappointing. There is too much me, me, me, I, I, I, in this book. The book is too much about this author's emotional problems and how Ammachi's influence affect her. Why would anyone be interested in this person? She's not famous or anything. If you want to know more about Ammachi and her influence on people in the world I suggest buying the well written book: Amma, Healing the Heart of the World."
3,Great Photos,"This book is full of great pictures of pool rooms past and present. Lots of room and player info. Very polished publication. Inetersting for those, like myself, interested in the sport and history. Not an instructional book; but definately worth the price and time to enjoy."
3,I thought it would cover more current plyers and more pool rooms,"I thought it would cover more current players and more pool rooms. I am aware of the huge task it would be to cover the pool rooms. I was atticipating finding a room in chiccago that I need to visit. It was interesting all the same, just not as current as I was intending."
2,disappointing,"I found this pillow to be fairly squishy and not particularily firm. Also, it's is made of foam and mine lost it's shape after about a month and became flat at one end."
5,JUST MY CUP OF.........,"These handy measuring cups deserve a better name than ""Odd Size,"" although that is indeed what they are. A better name is deserved because they're time saving and beautifully crafted.The cups are 3/4, 1 1/2, and 3 3/4 cups. No more using two cups when one will do. Further, they're made of stainless steel and can be used on the stove to melt chocolate or butter.The cups attach to a removable clip, and their oval shape makes it easy to pour into a narrow top container."
3,Can someone please explain........,"Why these don't stack with the regular size cup set? You would think that you could stack the two sets together. So besides the fact that it needs a 2/3 cup, they should be able to stack with the similarly oval cuisipro measuring cup set. They are very nice otherwise."
1,Badly acted and badly written,"Very low budget and the sexy prize should just keep her day job as a stripper because acting is not her strong suit. I would have fast forwarded through this but I promised myself that to review a movie I must suffer through these so called films. I really need to revisit that promise, just kidding; I will never fast-forward any film if I plan to review.So to the review;It was badly acted, badly written and a waste of time to watch, even with the so called twist at the end."
4,Side Splitting!,"For anyone accustomed to the relatively tame Martin seen on his T.V. series, be forewarned, this isn't the same Martin. He's better. From the intro, to the closing ""Fartin'& Sh..in'"" routine, he lets loose with a barrage of cuss-filled jokes. Best moment on the CD: when Martin is heckled by an audience member during a joke, and proceeds to lay waste to the guy with lip-smacking relish ('now, that WILL be on the album motherf...er'!) without missing a beat. I deducted one star because Mr. Lawrence recycles a lot of material from his film ""You So Crazy"", but his delivery and momentum are a lot better here. If you're offended by profanity or jokes involving bodily functions (his bit about 'sh-t crumbs' in bed is not for the squeamish, but is VERY FUNNY) then bypass this CD, but for fans of ribald, fearless comedy by a man in peak form, pick it up immediately. A Classic."
2,Disappointing effort by Lawrence,"""Talkin' Sh/t"" is a downgrade from Martin Lawrence's previous albumFunk It. Here, he gets personal, perhaps--no, definitely too personal, but at times the comedy and humor just falls flat. The album starts off slow but does pick up with three great tracks of observations and jokes in the middle, ""Michael Jackson,"" ""Ilaldo,"" and ""White Kids/Black Kids."" Here he rips apart celebrities like the Jackson family and Geraldo as well as child rearing. This album's effort isn't anything to rush out and listen to and even fans of Lawrence's comedy may be disappointed."
1,Poor choice.,This book is not very helpful to those who want to know why they are doing actions. Tool descriptions are next to non-existant. You are merely told what buttons to push and that is pretty much it.I believe you are better off playing with photoshop than using this book. You will probably learn more.
3,This Will Be Tough!,"Photoshop is the most amazing software, it ""blows-my-mind"" with all its capabilities. I love it. But, . . . it isn't easy to comprehend how to use it, it's tough. I was hoping, (I guess) for more of an ""idiot-proof"" book. I will have to really dig in to learn from this book, but I will give it a try."
4,Good,"This book is always a great teaching aid to the very complex program of Photoshop. This book has lots of examples and various ways of completing the same task. Although the book is very wordy and covers a lot, one is still able to complete the examples and understand the information fairly easily."
5,GREAT BOOK!,Great information and details. This book is so easy to follow and understand. It's great for starters and pros.
5,Excellent Product,Quick responce for delivery of an most satisfying product. meets my need for initial training in Photoshop and is truly Classroom in a book.
4,Helpful Resource,"This book was a required purchase as a supplement for a 4-week class I recently completed. Aside from a few minor typos, the book proves to be a helpful resource for me in and outside of the classroom. The examples are specific, and the word choice is straight-forward and easy to interpret. The CD of lesson materials has been expertly assembled. The lessons seem a bit ""time consuming"" as compared with other books... but the learnings are complete and easy to reference in the future. I intend to purchase other books from the ""Classroom in a Book"" series in the future."
5,Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book,The teacher uses lessons directly from the book and CD. It's easy to go back and review to create your own projects. Very user friendly.
1,The Title Says It all,"If you want to go back to your school days and have no interaction with the subject matter then this book is OK. But to work on your photos and learn what you want to do to them forget it. Way to structured, more suited to a textbook in a real class room where you can ask the teacher ""how do I do this"", forget it."
1,Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book,This book is the worst photoshop book I have ever used! In almost evey lesson he leaves out intructions. He acts like you did the lesson before. He does eveything the hard way. I hate this book and I would not give it a star. It takes forever to finish and I have to go to my NAPP help to do it the right way. I have not learned anything from this book. Don't buy it. Deb
2,More Fluff Then Substance,"This book covers most of the features in a very hit and run style. Each lesson tells you what to click on, but rarely why, and even then, only on some of the options.Several of the options in Photoshop have sub-options that are not covered in the book. I expected to have to do some experimentation, but not nearly to the degree that I have had to with a product published by Adobe. Any book with ""Classroom"" in the title should teach most, if not all, of the functions, not sell a few of the ""tada"" features of a program.As well, the table of contents and index are lacking as a reference tool."
1,Text doesn't match the program,"I managed to get to Lesson 2 before I gave up. The text talks about interface elements and tools that don't exist in CS2. For example, it talks about the Scale button -- there isn't one. It talks about the Transform window ( Window | Transform) and there isn't one. It mentions how the center point on a shape should be used when centering a new object -- except the center point disappears when you select a new tool from the toolbox! Completely disappointed because the writing style is nice, but it simply doesn't work with CS2."
3,Step-by-step - friend or foe?,"The CS2 Classroom in a Book gives you step-by-step instructions in each lesson on the various tools and attributes of Photoshop. The lessons are easy to complete and the book is easy to read. The catch? Being told what to do, step-by-step, without any real explanantion for WHY you're doing each step, makes it difficult to repeat these steps on your own projects and know what to do and why to do it. Use this book to learn the basic tool functions, but your best bet ultimately is to play with the tools in various circumstances and gauge your results."
3,"Reduced my fear of Photoshop, but it left me wanting much more","The lessons in this book were easy to follow and helped me orient myself in Photoshop and become confident using some very basic and useful tools.Unfortunately, most of the time it left me wanting more. It is filled with instructions like ""...select a small brush size, such as 3 or 5 pixels..."" but NEVER says why. Should I always use a small brush size with that tool, or just with that photo? I don't know, and that frustrates me. Even a short sentence to help me understand a little about why they choose those settings would make this book much much more useful."
4,Good book to have when you're just learning,"Being a novice to photoshop, this book gives easy clear instructions. The tips are very helpful. In conjunction with a class at the local community college learning photoshop has been fun and easy."
5,"This is the book you need, stop looking...","Im a college student, ive taken multiple classes that were supposed to ""teach"" us software via textbooks and this is by far the easiest book to follow. I have no formal experience with the software, i just bought it recently because this is the last year i will be able to take advantage of a student discount on software, and i thought it would come in handy... ive burned thru the first 1/2 of the book in 3 nites, prolly 2 hours a nite.. Its not tedious at all, very straight forward and color illustrated step by step... They give you the keyboard shortcuts, as well as the pull down menu commands upfront, and it guides you through the things you will actually use without alot of b.s. i will be ordering the rest of the series on adobe software to learn the rest of the web bundle, probably the best $45 ive spent on textbooks yet."
4,Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book,"I am using this book for an on-line class on Photoshop CS2. Since it has a CD and lessons within the book, it is a helpful way to learn CS2. My one complaint, though, is that there are parts of lessons where the directions are a bit confusing and not always clear. After rereading and experimenting, though, you can usually figure it out. If a novice with Photoshop and CS2, I would also encourage using other Photoshop books, e.g. Colin Smith's How to do Everything with Adobe Photoshop CS2, since they will include other clarifications regarding the topics involved in CS2."
3,Absolute beginner book.,"This is an absolute beginner book which serves only as a primer. Look elsewhere if you are looking for a technical, in depth manual."
5,Well Organized Tutorial,"I found a liking to the style of the book, going through the chapters as a lesson with review questions at end of each. The material is presented well, in terms the typical reader will understand. The companion CD is chock full of support material and the book itself is in full color. Written by authors who truly know their stuff."
4,.,I think this book was too advanced for beginners. I would have preferred a book that allowed the student to put parts of a picture together.
2,Ayn Rand's Objectivism at its most puzzling,"Caldwell is obviously much taken with the ""philosophy"" of Ayn Rand. Objectivism favors people who do whatever they want to do, listening to no one's advice, unconcerned for the damage they may be doing to others. It mistrusts sacrifice, calling it manipulative.The book in a treatise with dialogue slipped in between harangues. Caldwell's device is constant flashbacks to the early days of the hero, who is in a hospital, catatonic after attempting--but failing--suicide. Characters are heroic or wimps--no shadows here. All the good women are ugly and all power is terrific. Reading this novel is like watching a cobra swallow a mouse: it's mesmerizing."
4,Good Product & Installs Easily,"To think I depended upon my A/C company to change these out each year...for $60!The Apriliaire Spaceguard filter does a great job in capturing dust and particulates. I still use 3 cheap-o 12x12 filters at the intakes (changed every 60 days) as a pre-filter to the Spaceguard. Here in FL where the system gets year-round use, I get a full year out of the Spaceguard"
5,COULDN'T BE HAPPIER,This filter two pack is the perfect answer to the Space-Gard replacement filter. This was the first time I had ordered filters online but I was unhappy with other replacements that I had purchased in the past because they didn't fit well and were expensive. These fit perfectly with no gaps anywhere (as if they were custom made)and the price was better than I was able to find in any store. Of course ordering through Amazon is always the way to go. I am so happy with their service.
5,In-kind Filter Replacement,"Filters arrived well ahead of schedule. They were exactly like original filters they were replacing. Couldn't ask for more.There are detailed instructions on the web at [...] that show exactly how to replace filters, but it is so simple most people will not need any help."
1,Not an Aprilaire filter... Keep Shopping.,"First the good:- Shipping was fast, ordered the 8th arrived the 11thNow the bad:This is NOT an Aprilaire filter. It is 20x25x6 and fits a space-gard 2200 frame but if you are expecting the little aprilaire box with the fine quality accordion filter that you have to put the combs in you will be disappointed.The picture of the product at Amazon is in no way representative of the product received. It's a black and white cardboard frame and has maybe half as many pleats as a true Aprilaire filter. It's black and white for a reason... it's simply a low quality generic filter.I will give each no more than 3 months in the unit before i pitch them and I will NEVER use this vendor or Amazon for filter media again."
1,No longer an Aprilaire filter...I agree: keep shopping.,I ordered the replacement filters from this vendor for my Aprilaire system back in 2009 and was happy to have found a convenient supply of Aprilaire filters online.I finally got around to opening my most recent package of filters for an order that I placed in November of 2010 and was extremely disappointed to find two pre-assembled generic filters. These filters are not Aprilaire filters. I agree with a previous reviewer: I will not be using this vendor on Amazon for filters ever again.
5,Perfect replacement,"Comes with clear instructions on how to replace the filter. It's a 5 minutes job if you do it for the first time. Take your time to not break any plastic part because the box only contains the filter, no replacement for broken plastic parts."
1,Not like it is pictured...,The product I received is not an Aprilaire Filter and did not look like the picture at all. I am sending it back because it didnt fit my a/c like an Aprilaire. Dont buy it. Amazon should really look into it. This is the first time I have ever purchased something from Amazon and it was not as it was represented.
5,Air Conditioning Filters,"It's a filter! How do I know if it's working? However, install was easy, with the airflow guides on the panels. The price was right, and I got two, so I was happy."
5,One Might Say that this is the Best CD Ever!,"This album proves Billy Lawrence has soul! This album is more of a romantic ballad album, their are some up-beat songs, but if you are in love or having problems in a relationship this is the album to pick up and listen to over and over again at night time."
5,Enjoyable kid songs,I had the cassette tape in the mid-90's for a child I under my care and now I wanted the CD for my own child. He enjoys listening to the music.
1,"good brand, wrong parts, bad service","We've had good luck with Dorman parts in the past and I would not hesitate to order this brand again from a source that could deliver the right one. We got aggravation, delay, and inconvenience - - - and for that we paid $17. Twice we were sent the wrong part by Amazon.com. By the time we figured out that this wasn't going to be right we had to pay a restocking fee to get any refund at all. Our project was delayed more than a month. We've moved on to an on-line retailer that understands car parts."
5,As always amazon comes thru!!,"ordered the regulator on the morning of october 4th and it was on my doorstep october 5th at 2pm.the price was also within a couple of dollars of the lowest price i could find anywhere! 94.82 w/tax.. the local parts store wanted upward of 130.00 and the dealer alot more.i saved at least 100.00,for a shop wanted 225.00 to replace it...it was very easy to change,as i went on you tube a watched a video by a1 auto.the whole experience was as always awesome.thank you amazon"
5,Works Great,"This was a perfect fit for the stock regulator of a 2007 Trailblazer. The hardest part is getting the old one out, but the new one installed in minutes. This was $20 cheaper than anywhere else online. I recommend this ...."
4,Good book,"This is a very interesting private account of the events in Germany that took place over and after the World Wars I and II. It also presents a deeper look at these historical periods that are perhaps less familiar to the average reader. Hence, there is quite a lot to learn from it. Two slight problems for me are: as for the diary form of it the usage of English (this is a translation) is too artistic for me. It reads as if some translator was exercising his writing style and by doing so overdid it a little. The second is that it follows the `Hitler: bad guy` theme and it does so to the very extreme. Oh, how great thigs were before Hitler came - the author seems to reminisce. In fact, Hitler did `fix up` many problems. This bad guy theme seems to tire me a little these days, for its lack of objectivity. Even Dark-Vader (Star Wars) has been given a slightly fairer hearing in the last episodes. Overall, a great book."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Just for those who are thinking or have recently bought a Sony clie PEG-NR70(V). DO NOT BUY IT OR RETURN IT. I have been doing extensive research about the nr70 after i had bought mine and returned the first two due to defects. News flash: there are fatal programming and hardware issues with the Clie NR70! This is why Sony discontinued this model after only a few months of sales.The NR70 is a great PDA due to the conceptual design. This is why I am urging people to buy the PEG-NX70(v). They have improved on the software and hardware. This unit runs the Palm OS 5.0, way better! Also, they replaced the plastic casing with a more sturdy metal casing ( a bit heavier, but worth it, as my first unit was returned for the case cracking umong other things). Please please please heed my advice. I went through enough problems, you don't need it too. Just fork out the extra dough for the better model. It's better in the long run."
4,Clie won't beam anything but phone listings to other PDAs,"I want you to know that I love my Clie, I had a palm IIIC and needed to upgrade because I ran out of space. The camera is a great feature and I use it all the time to bring home photos to explain things to my family and friends, a picture is worth a 1000 words. My husband quickly adopted my IIIC and this is the only problem, we both used to have palms and we could beam notes, memos, addresses, phone numbers and apointments to each other. The Clie can only beam phone numbers. It won't beam anything else. If anyone has a quick fix let me know."
1,"Great Concept, bad execution. GET THE NX70(V)","Just for those who are thinking or have recently bought a Sony clie PEG-NR70(V). DO NOT BUY IT OR RETURN IT. I have been doing extensive research about the nr70 after i had bought mine and returned the first two due to defects. News flash: there are fatal programming and hardware issues with the Clie NR70!

4,Sony CLIE PEG-NR70V Handheld,Works well enough If you want it just for your day to day activities.I have had to reset it like a million times. Good thing is it does n ot lose your data whet you reset.The camera is a sham and never works at all.Nice media player though.You can not sync it on any other palm OS even those that run The same OS.I am looking to excnange it off or sell it off.
3,Interferes with window operation.,"Bought these for my Ranger pickup after trying ventshades on the wife's Malibu. This set is different in that it installs into the window channel, giving a much cleaner external appearance. Unfortunately, they interfere with operation of the windows. Finally got things working after much trimming of plastic, feathering the edges, and regluing into the channel.Installing ventshades is a good thing. The external shades are more visually apparent, particularly on a light colored vehicle. The in-channel shades may interfere with operation of your windows."
2,Didnt fit,"There is a gap at the very end of it near my mirror cuz it didnt fit the right way, but it rained yesterday and they did what they are meant to do..."
2,Not that great,"The authors' notion of success was frequently to find a magnetic ""hit"" and presume that they had found the ship. In many cases, no attempt was made to uncover the wreck to confirm the find.There was also apparently no proofreader or editor involved in producing this book. Sailors ""sink Dixie"" instead of singing it (p. 90); Sol Thomas dies in the Dakota Territories (p. 179) and yet is resurrected on page 184; Cussler ""charted"" a boat when he should have ""chartered"" it (p. 221); a ship ""shuttered"" when it should have ""shuddered"" (p. 262); etc."
2,real life treasure hunting,I was a little disapointed in this book. I was expecting a diary of events relating to the discovery of all the lost ships. I didn't get it.
1,"I enjoyed the first, but this one....","I really enjoyed the first volume, but as I read this one something began to bother me. I couldn't put my finger on it until about page 108 when Cussler, or should I say Dirgo, details a friend's sense of humour.The friend refuses to stow his bag on the plane, because it really isn't against FAA regulations not to. The flight attendant has to deal with this fellow, who Cussler tells us is an FAA investigator, and a retired Col. in the Air Force, as he refuses to do as she asks. She has to get the pilot to come and speak to this friend, who when faced with a ""suitable"" authority figure, has already stowed the bag.Ho-ho! What a great joke.Then it hit me, the whole book is filled with ""We're so much smarter than everyone"" episodes from the flight attendant to a 7/11 clerk. If you agree that Cussler and his friends are the pinnacles of human evolution, then this is the book for you.I would recommend reading the historical chapters and skipping the rest."
4,clive cussler book,In condition as stated and recieved as expected. Bought this as a gift for a Clive Cussler fan. They should love it.
3,"Good book, not as good as the first","I really enjoy Cussler's fictionalized accounts of these ships and then his search for them. Alas, Clive is getting old and it's harder for him to search himself. In addition, it's seems their luck is less this go-round, not finding as many wrecks.What really bothered me was Amazon's terrible editing. It appears they scanned the book, with literally hundreds of glaring typos. Most notably rn's appearing as m's. I wish someone spent some time to fix them.All in all a good read. I enjoy Cussler's style."
5,One of the best in this area,"This book is one of the best to have an overall review about growth strategy. It mentions a lot about the importance, the implications, and the execution. Author has quoted quite a number of real life examples to strengthen the points mentioned. An area which I believe is a bit weak about this book is the making up of the options for growth."
3,Just Looking,"I started to read this book recently. Putnam is an example of the kind of professor that Harvard likes to hire--a popularizer. He writes well and does thorough research. However, his thinking seems to be flaccid. By focuing his study on ""mainstream"" organizations, and ignoring ""alternative"" organizations, he sacrifices intellectual rigor to make an argument. He cannot accept that the subject of his interest is too generalized to be explained by statistical variables. He does make some provocative points about ""social capital"" and its perceived decline."
3,"Great concept, but it's really PC, glad I didn't pay full price","The book is still an interesting read because of the concept, but the author seems to think that ""integration"" and multiculturalism are positive things, and misses the cause of the dissolution of American community and the apathy and isolation that have plagued American public life."
2,all that to say tv is bad? puh-leease,"disappointing. it certainly contains an impressive amount of data, yet to what end? putnam would have been more productive by looking at increasing trends rather than those in decline. it's as if he is concerned that fewer people are roller-skating without recognizing that people are roller-blading instead."
1,"What isn't Social Capital, Reification of a Good Idea","Unfortunately, the author doesn't know where social capital ends. It seems like every possible organization under the sun is defined as a source of social capital, provided it was expanding in the post WWII period and declined later on. The concept of social capital is applied so broadly it ends up meaningless. Reification of a good idea."
5,Bowling Alone,"This is a profound book. Required reading for existing in the digital age. It had a little more information than I could handle, but so has the rest of my education."
4,Putnam hits on some important issues you can't ignore,"First of all, this is a relatively easy read and very intriguing. I just couldn't put it down. Putnam presents good evidence that social capital has indeed declined. Most of his statistical work is in good order. Most people would have a tough time disproving Putnam's evidence. But I am also a critical reader. I think he fell a little short in the ""Why"" section. I feel that the nature of social capital is changing (as technology and civilization progress) and Putnam doesn't touch on that enough. Also, some of his graphs and charts in this section are arbitrary. Overall it is a good book that looks at a potentially serious problem. All that being said, I recommend this book to anyone who cares about the society they live in. It is certainly an eye opener."
3,Pulls Its Punches,"I was disappointed in this book because it didn't explore what I think is clearly one of the major contributors to the decline in civic culture over the past thirty years: the movement of women into the workplace. Fascist, you say? I'm not suggesting this was a bad development. So much of the social capital discussed by the author, however, was created by women of previous generations, the rise of dual income families and single parenthood has so exacerbated the time crunch, that I have to wonder why the author didn't spend more time on this explenation. The answer, I suspect, is he didn't want to be called a gauleiter. One can point to a change, suggest it had consequences, and not necessarily favor going back (I don't, I think more people have to do what so many women in the past did for free). Still, good book."
4,"A bit academic, but...","Putnam's thesis sounds correct, and he goes far to prove it, even to those who say he's all wrong."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZ.......,"The title of this book is so much more promising that the actual body. The premise that we have been becoming more disconnected as a society,and thus, are more dissatisfied is provocative. This is a book for those who enjoy graphs and indexes, and pie charts. I read it as a class assignment and it felt just like that...homework."
2,A bunch of gobbltigook by any other name...,"This book disappoints me. It seems as though it were written with the knowledge that it would sell no matter what it said. Also, the data provided often left much to be desired, and I think failed to show the real picture. Putnams conclusion was very weak."
3,It is a cheap container that should cost only $10!,"Well, It is just Ok, nothing special. You can get the same cheese using a colander and a tupperware...Maybe it is more convinient because it has its lid but it should cost only $10"
3,"Small, odd shaped and leaves a taste behind...","Hi, so I've had this for a couple of days and while the cheese maker certainly does work, the complaints that it is small are true. I would prefer a similar product that could handle the typical 32 ounce yogurt container common in US grocery stores.It also seems to be true that the product can leave a metallic aftertaste in the yogurt. If you use this, it's probably best to remove the yogurt after 24 hours and not leave it in the cheese maker.The shape of it, while I guess effectively maximizing the surface area of the yogurt for straining, also makes it difficult to remove all of the yogurt without scraping the screen (and imparting a metallic aftertaste).I think I am going to try just getting some very fine mesh but larger strainers, and straining the yogurt directly into a container, which is a shame, I really do like the way this cheese maker and its container all nicely fit compactly into the fridge with a lid."
5,Love it!,"I can't say enough about this product. It works fantastic! I put plain yogurt into the mesh filled to the top, put lid on top, placed in refrigerator overnight and voila, next morning you will have something like 'Fage' that strained yoghurt in the dairy aisle of your neighborhood supermarket.Just make sure the yogurt you use does not say on the label that it has been thickened with cornstarch or gelatin, because I made that mistake and it took 3 days to really strain well. That was my own fault - I didn't look first. Regular good old fashioned yogurt will work every time and it becomes so thick and creamy, you could use it in place of sour cream on your baked potatoes etc... I like it mixed with fruit or just plain and without all that added sugar.Thank you Amazon for a fine and useful product."
4,Interested in food.,This worked great and is easier then a cheese cloth to use. A word of warning - read the ingredients of the yogurt and avoid those with thickeners!!
5,Great for Greek-style yogurt!,"I absolutely love this. It makes it so easy to make nice, thick greek-style yogurt. No more messy cheese cloth!!"
5,works perfectly,"I love homemade yogurt, but also enjoy a thicker style than I can make on my own. You can strain yogurt through cheesecloth or other strainers, but this works PERFECTLY with no mess. The resulting yogurt is like greek yogurt - nice and thick and creamy. You can also make labne (yogurt cheese) which is delicious with some zaatar (sumac), a bit of paprika, sprinkle of cayenne, salt and olive oil. Serve with veggie sticks or crackers -- delicious! Would buy it again."
4,easy to use,"I wanted thick home made yogurt without having to add gelatin, so I had to put cheese cloth in a sieve before I found the Cuisipro yogurt cheese maker. This product definitely is easier and less messy to use.Very easy to use to make and store laban (thick yogurt). Wish the container was slightly deeper than the current size so that itwould not have to emptied out every so often."
3,may not work for homemade yogurt,"I make my own yogurt from a culture (no yogurt machine, just a ball jar at room temperature each day). Unfortunately, I cannot use my own yogurt in this cheese maker, it just flows through the mesh. I think it may work if I used whole milk when making my yogurt, as that produces a thicker yogurt, but I have not tried that yet."
1,Rusty Yogurt Strainer,"Three months after purchasing, and using only 4 or 5 times, my straining screen is rusting along the border in 5 or 6 places. It's always been hand washed and dried immediately, never left to sit in water for any period of time. Guess I won't be using this anymore. What a bummer - it worked really well - just didn't last."
4,"great product, needs a few improvements","I love this, great for making the yogurt cheese, I'd like to be able todump in a 32 oz yougurt and i do but it is too close to the edge almost overlflowing, invaribly some spills, it it were just 1/4 inch taller itwould be great, also I shouldn't have to come back and dump the whey1/2 way through the bottom should be big enough to hold a the whey of a32 oz yougurt drained off. Follow the recipie ideas and then get creative with the yogurt cheese it is great. Try the key lime pie oneits the best! and it couldn't be easier to make!"
3,yogurt cheese maker,"The cheese turns out very good. Nice ad smooth. The metal part of the container rusts, if not dried right away. The screen on mine, rusted after first use!"
5,Yum - Perfect Yogurt Cheese in a Few Hours,"After purchasing Donvier's yogurt maker, I thought this cheese maker would help me turn my softer yogurt into something thicker, a facsimile of the yogurt I tasted in Turkey and Greece. I was right -- after making my own preservative and additive free yogurt in my Donvier yogurt maker, I simply poured all eight containers into the compact cheesemaker, closed the lid and let it stay overnight in the refrigerator. Voila, the next morning, I had a perfectly creamy spread to put on my whole grain toast. I used Total Greek yogurt as my starter, so my yogurt very nearly reached the perfection I have been seeking: creamy, tart and no added sugar.If you are a food perfectionist or simply do not like to buy any product loaded with corn syrup or any of the other usual suspects commonly used by manufacturers to up the taste for the general public, you will find purchasing the Donvier yogurt and cheese maker well worth the price."
4,This is a pretty cool little device....,But it was still pricey for what it is...a strainer! I like it because it is built into the box with a top. I don't have to worry about a strainer with a handle leaving a gap so air can get to the yogurt while straining. It is also pretty fast. I got this to experiment with making yogurt and yogurt cheeses. If you are doing the same this is a great little set. I still wish it was only about 5.00!
5,so easy to use and clean,"This is a great product. Very easy to use and to clean. It arrived quickly, and I've been using it ever since."
5,This is an absolutely fantastic product!,"When I bought the Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Cheese Maker, I never expected such great results as I had. I make my own yogurt and sometimes buy store bought yogurt to make into Greek yogurt. I just put either my homemade yogurt or store bought yogurt into the strainer and wella, I have Greek yogurt or yogurt cheese, depending on how long I leave it in. It's a breeze to clean and the lid keeps it fresh from odors. I gave one as a gift to my daughter and she loves it too. This saves so much money by making your own. I would recommend this."
5,"simple, yet brilliant!","I use yogurt cheese to make dips and anywhere sour cream is called for. This contraption is fabulous and so easy. Spoon it in, let it sit in the fridge overnight and voila - yogurt cheese! Use yogurt cheese anywhere sour cream is called for in a recipe to reduce fat and calories."
3,Yogurt Cheese,"I have NOT purchased this item as yet, but wanted to contribute my knowledge of another name. I usually buy a product by Alta Denta (sp?) called Kefir cheese; this is also a yogurt cheese. But the only place that I have found that product is Whole Foods Market in my fairly Large town; however I am to be transplanted soon to a very, very small town...and I am looking for items to make my own products, and this one looks very interesting."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the Yogurt Cheese Maker. I tried several brands of yogurt and they all just went thru the screening, so really was a waste of my money. Granted, wasn't as much as some of the other products, but could have gotten better (and did) results with cheese cloth,.'"
1,Turns the yogurt gray & metal tasting!,"i should have known better ... since i don't make my kefir in any metal containers. the reviews got me again ... i should have followed my intuition.when i got the yogurt cheese out of the container the next day it was a perfect consistency BUT gray where it touched the metal screen and the taste was such a strong metal taste is was nauseating. the whey was gray and metal tasting as well. just a horrible experience. i don't understand the positive reviews since the product DOES NOT work for making, edible, yogurt cheese!"
4,I Like It - But ...,"I usually make yocheese with a small amount of yogurt, maybe a cup or so, and have been using a Melita coffee filter with a paper filter, covered with plastic wrap, placed over a small jar - which I later use for storage of the cheese. This works very well for small amounts. I put the same amount in my brand new Cuisipro Donvier cheese maker and left it over night in the fridge. It wasn't as thick as it is with the coffee filter as not as much liquid (whey) drained out of it, after about the same amount of time. I think I will stick with the coffee filter for small amounts and use this for larger batches. It was very easy to clean and doesn't take up much space in my already over crowded fridge."
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"I make my own, quite thick yogurt, and this does strain it, but it also lets a good amount of the yogurt through too. So to make a couple cups of greek style yogurt you have to strain about 4-6 cups of thick yogurt. Also you are not left with nice clear whey that can be used for making bread or other recipes, you end up with a half yogurt half whey, mess. I returned mine because I don't wish to spend 2-3 days just to make a couple cups, nor do I like throwing half my yogurt away."
5,Works exactly as described.,I've successfully made the best labne (Lebanese yogurt) for my Lebanese husband who declared it was superior to any he's tasted before. Great product.
4,pretty good,"I've had it a few weeks now so I wouldn't say I can speak for the long-term durability of it but I like it so far.The downsides, I'd say, are that the mesh is stainless (as opposed to plastic), and it's kind of small. I typically make 3 cups of yogurt at a time and it all just fits. The mesh is not as fine as I expected but if I don't stir the yogurt at all before pouring it in, it holds just fine. I like the container itself. It feels really sturdy and the lid seals well. It's pretty easy to scrape with a small rubber spatula and clean up is simple, too."
4,It works for kefir,"I was nervous, somehow I ordered this without looking at the reviews. There are complaints about the screen not being made of stainless steel, however the most recent one is over two years old. It seems the manufacturer has corrected this issue. Mine has a stainless screen and I've been using it for kefir for over a week, no problem.Yes, you can use stainless steel with kefir. I do it. I've read that others do also, and there's even at least one commercial outfit that uses stainless steel."
4,Very Handy,"I love this cheese maker and use it all the time. I have a yoghurt maker and occasionally the yoghurt is a bit thin so I pop it in the cheese maker for 15-30 minutes and I have beautiful thick creamy yoghurt. I was puzzled when some reviewers said their home made yoghurt went straight through the sieve.My grandchildren love it and are now happy to eat it rather than ice cream (much healthier for them) Naturally I also use it to make 'cheese' by leaving it overnight. I use the 'cheese' as a substitute for quark which isn't available in Australia...yes, I'm doing the Dukan Diet and am now nice and slim again. YEA :)My only advice is don't let your husband put the lid in the dishwasher as it warps and you have to pour boiling water over it then place something heavy on it to straighten it out again &#128536;"
5,Christmas gift,"This was a Christmas gift for my mother and she has seemed absolutely pleased with it, it was what she wanted and the price was fair and reasonable"
4,"Operator Error Fixed, now I love it!","I must be buying the wrong kind of yogurt because it won't separate the whey. I tried this originally (making yogurt cheese that is) with cheese cloth and hanging it over a bowl, and the same problem, even though I am using a different brand of yogurt than last time with the cheese cloth. The idea of the item seems like a good one, it's very sturdily made, but unless I can figure out the secret I'm disappointed. Any suggestions please let me know!UPDATE: After one of the other Amazon reviewers said to use all natural yogurt instead of the processed stuff that has chemicals to keep it from separating, I'm updating my review to like it and THANK YOU!!!! Mr Reviewer with the good advice. Works awesome with the natural yogurt. Overnight I have yogurt cheese, super easy and a nice healthy spread for sandwiches and on toast and to dip veggies in, and goodness knows what else I'll come up with :)"
2,Smells & tastes awful!!,"When I took this item out of the box it had a very strong odor. The instructions for cleaning only stated to clean with soap just before each use. I washed it with warm soapy water and it still smelled. I allowed it to soak in hot soapy water for an hour or so. The smell was pretty much gone, so I decided to go ahead and try it out. I allowed it to strain for nearly 24 hours. When I dumped the cheese out, what was closest to the mesh had a grey color and the cheese had a metalic smell. I scraped off the grey layer and tasted it and it had a metalic taste. I am going to run the cheese maker through the dishwasher and try it one more time. If I get the metalic taste/smell again, I am returning it and I'll just use cheesecloth to make it. I am very disappointed!"
3,disappointing,"1. would be much better if the container were clear so you could see how much whey has drained.2. the mesh screen doesn't drain nearly as ""cleanly"" as ;using cloth. The resulting yogurt is good, but not what I expected."
4,yogurt cheese maker,Works great. You can have a delicious yogurt cheese in as little as 8 hours. Add a little olive oil and dip with pita bread. A wholesome healthy mediterrean treat.
4,Handy Item,"I've strained yogurt for years using cheesecloth or a paper towel in a colander; this method is much cleaner and allows you to let the yogurt drain in the refrigerator which is a huge plus. With a lid over it, you can ward off any ambient refrigerator odors while your cheese is coming together. The only complaint I have is that the item is too small to hold a full 32 oz. container of yogurt. Otherwise it's a handy item!"
3,yogurt cheese maker,"Okay. Works as described. Container is not large enough to hold 32 oz size of yogurt, which would be nice."
3,Strainer did not work!,"I know this product 'can' work because my sister has one and I have borrowed it. However, when I ordered my own, I got it, used it and the strainer mesh was not small enough and the yogurt went right through the strainer. I called the company (a family owned business). I am awaiting a replacement in the mail."
2,NOT FOR KEFIR!,"I was looking for an easy way to make Kefir Cheese, but despite other reviews, the Donvier is not a good fit. I tried lining the devise with 6-7 coffee filters with no luck, finally I found some success with a doubled up washcloth lined with coffee filters. But really ... by that point, why bother? There wasn't enough room in the Maker for a decent amount of cheese to form. How to rate this item? It's solidly constructed. Fits together well. I have no doubt that it would work with a nice thick yogurt, but it's more liquid-y sister, kefir, just runs though the stainless steel mesh."
3,This is OK but here's a better idea for Greek yogurt!,"I tried this device because I love Greek yogurt. It works fine, but you waste some that sticks to the maker. Be careful not to leave the yogurt in the maker too long, or you will get cheese, not thicker yogurt.Anyway, what I learned: You don't need this to make Greek yogurt. It is really easy to do without any device at all:1) Buy a nice big carton of your favorite plain yogurt (I like Cascade and you can get a huge container that lasts all week.)2) Don't ever stir it up.3) Every time you want some yogurt, drain the liquid whey from the container before you spoon it out.4) It will get thicker and thicker, each time you drain the whey.That is all Greek yogurt is: yogurt with the whey drained off, right? No muss, no fuss, no waste, no buying anything (hope Amazon doesn't erase this review!)"
4,"A good read, but seems a bit over priced","I really enjoyed reading this book. As with any collection of short stories, I liked some more than others, but there were none in here that I didn't like. There were a couple that I consider to be real gems. My only real complaint is that it's not much book for 12 bucks. It's about half an inch thick, with eight stories in it. I guess maybe it's priced higher than most paperback books because of the cost involved for a small company to have smaller quantities of a book like this printed, but I must admit I was a bit disappointed with it in this respect."
5,Mossberg ghost ring sight set,Awesome customer service. Item shipped quickly from supplier with tracking info available. Nothing works better for Mossberg shotguns than Mossberg factory equipment!
1,NOT IN STOCK,"I wanted this item but for some reason it is not available anywhere. Not sure of why not because it is a needed item. If the item is not available from the manufacturer, it should not be listed."
4,"Comprehensive, fair, but be prepared","This is a wonderful and nostalgic book for long time CCM fans. Everybody is here. I have wasted hours poring thru it. The author is opinionated but fair in his reviews. But readers who share the popular evangelical views on abortion, homosexuality, and particularly eschatology (dispensational pre-millenialism a la Left Behind) may not see their perspectives reflected in the essays. A stellar work. I wish I could have had time to do such a fun project."
4,Not what I thought it would be!,I thought it would have more 'internet' pointers/information about the songs also. My wife said she liked it (it was a birthday present for her).She also says that she will and has used it. She sings at church and is involved with the song selections some times.
5,Great book,"This is a wonderfully informative book. When I recieved it, I just could not put it down. So many interesting facts and information. If you are a Christian music fan, it is a must own book.I can't wait for an updated version or at least a contunuation to 2009."
1,Opinions not encyclopedia,"I bought this book with high hopes that it would be an encyclopedia. Upon getting it and reading it the author's bias and opinions seem to carry more weight then just the facts. That's all I wanted, just the facts. Encyclopedia writers usually let their readers decide their opinions instead of brandishing theirs. He uses the book to get his church bashing in. If there is an updated version out or coming out from this author, I for one will not be purchasing it. Highly disappointing!"
5,Unsalted Organic Corn Chips are a 100% value purchase,"Unsalted organic corn chips are the absolute best choice when entertaining. Tortilla chips almost always accompany salsa or nacho cheese sauce and additional salt found with other chips can become overwhelming. The sweet corn goodness is great while eating these alone and not necessarily requiring a complimenting side-kick. You cannot go wrong by having an available supply in your pantry to serve whenever guests crave a snack or as a personal snack or meal ingredient. I also purchased a case of the elRio brand (my choice was mild) nacho cheese sauce from Amazon and it was a perfect match to these chips. Having something extra on hand is always a blessing when a group of children drop in to play PS2 and suddenly want something to eat. That is my household, and also why I love Amazon."
3,Not Brunner at his Best,"I am a Seminary graduate and I have all of Brunner's books on theology; and, his superb commentary on Romans. This book is dogmatic and more conservative than anything I've ever experienced from Brunner. He is repititious and unyielding on what appear to be narrow view points. He could have written it in far fewer pages and been more open. Its not that the content is not good; its just that it's not as open and enlightening as I had expected. I highly recommend his commentary on Romans; one of the briefest and best written, with outstanding comments in the subject appendices."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't figure out how to operate the organizer. The instructions were very poor, and incomplete. They should have included specific tasks, and how to do them."
1,Garbage,"This product is garbage. The print is way too small, there is no light on the screen, it cannot be synced to a computer. This product was a waste of money."
1,A Toy not user friendly,"This is an extremely poorly designed Digital Organizer. The screen is difficult to read, adding addresses, etc. is very time consuming and frankly not worth the effort. We returned the unit for a refund."
1,Bad product,"This is definitely not for seniors although I have very good eyesight. It is so small and confusing. But the worst part is that all of the icons you need to use are at the bottom of the device in slate grey against a slate grey background making it next to impossible to read let alone to use, I shipped mine back to Amazon."
3,Rolodex,Do not count on the battery that it comes with it will die very quickly get an energizer or a duracell watch battery instead. Lacks a backlight. only get as a cheap replacement for your palm or smartphone.
1,Very Good album. Horrible Sound Quality.,I can't believe the people at Razor & Tie records actually thought releasing a re-issue that sounds like it was transferred from a cheap record player was a good idea. It is the worst sounding re-issue I have ever heard. Maxine Nightingale and her fans deserve much better than this.
1,Classic album- Horrific sound quality,"Buyer beware...the other reviewers are correct. The sound quality is so poor you would almost think this release is a joke. Where is the quality control at razor & tie? What happened? ""Lead Me On"" is on numerous compilations, and the sound quality is excellent. Razor & Tie must have gotten the wrong ""master tapes"". Actually, not only is the sound so poor, it appears that the tracks are in mono, with only one original channel playing in both ears! If you don't believe me, find ""Lead Me On"" on any compilation, waste your money on this, then compare. I'm not kidding. To top it off, the track listing is incorrect! Of all the times I've read these reviews, this is the first time I have been motivated to write one. What a disappointment. The sound is really that bad. Unbelievable."
3,MONOTONE,"I Own the LP that this CD is based on. I even have a 45 of ""Lead me on"" with ""Love me Like you Mean it"" as a B side. Other reviewers aparrently discovered what I did upon listening to this CD. It is recorded/mastered in MONO SOUND. Is this the end of the world? No, but it is a bit dull considering the rather wild and rich stereo sound the music was actually recorded in. Had I known then what I know now about this disk I might have waited for a better alternative. FOR DIEHARD OR TONE DEAF FANS ONLY!"
1,Badly Mastered in Mono,"I agree with most of the other negative reviewers here. This was an engineering error, no doubt, but something that Razor & Tie should have caught before sending out this CD to the marketplace. A bad mark on them!"
4,Nearly perfect,"Having the best cornbread recipe in the WORLD, naturally I wanted the best cornbread pan in the world! I loved how evenly it baked my light and fluffy cornbread sticks, but even though I oiled lightly before baking much of the cornbread stuck to the pan. That disappointed me. However, the corn shaped mold looks terrific on the bottom of the bread. Do be prepared for the weight of this pan. It is really heavy. I dropped it pulling it out of the cabinet and was thrilled my bare foot was NOT directly under it! Very easy to clean, even with the cornbread stuck on the bottom. I will use a bit more oil next time so maybe the cornbread sticks will pop right out! Love it! I would say the Lodge Pans Cast Iron Cornbread Pan was a nearly perfect purchase. :-)"
3,not up-to-date,"This is a very handy reference book for student s of German, but it is not updated to the new spellings (yet...?) which took effect this year. I only realized this after I bought it. The new spelling rules may not last for long, but most German textbooks use the new spelling system- and its confusing to have reference materials which indicate two different spellings for the same word. Anyway, just a warning..."
5,"If your a German Major or Minor, this is a must have","I purchased this book in college and as a German Major, it has been a life saver. If you are a German Major or Minor, this book is a must right next to a good German/English Dictionary."
5,AWESOME!,"This book is great for anyone who needs help finding out the difference between strong and weak verbs. The verb tenses (Perfect, imperfect, plusperfect, etc.) are given for each word. I wish the book could include every German verb out there, but this book should be bought by everyone who needs help with German verbs."
3,"Good, not great",The examples and conjugation lists are quite useful and accurate. Lacks of important verbs and contains loads of inutile ones. Nichts besonders.
3,Limited,"The best use for this book may be in composition writing for a German class. Pick a verb, build a sentence around it. That is great for learning the formal language. However, in situations where you need to interpret what is meant by something already spoken or written in German, this book could leave you very confused. The translation for the words are too limited. They don't include the multiple uses a word can have. Buy it. But use it as a companion to a huge dictionary."
3,Good Grammer book,This book is good in that all the verbs are fully conjugated. I found that this helps in building sentences. I found out some of the definitions in the back of the book arn't correct. I asked my German exchange student about some of the verbs and we realized that the meanings in the back were wrong or only correct in some uses. The verbs are conjugated correctly but this book doesn't help you with useage.
5,PV,Does work up to its potential as advertised.Connected my phone (via USB) and a portal dvd player for my daughter simultaneously and they both work just fine.Time it takes to charge the phone has not changed at least from what I have noticed.Good Luck!
1,"USB ports work, but 12V sockets did not","I was very disappointed in this. Both USB ports work fine, but neither 12V socket works. I tried it in multiple vehicles with functioning 12V sockets, so I know it wasn't the vehicle. In theory, this is great and the price was right. I wanted to be able to charge my phone and GPS at the same time, with an extra USB port if a passenger needed it, and the extra 12V port to use a power inverter for a laptop when needed."
1,"Great idea, bad implementation","Got the product, plugged it into my car, everything worked. Good news so far. The second time I used it, the USB ports didn't work. Maybe I blew a fuse on it, except the 12 V sockets were working. Just a defect in the USB ports. I got a refund, so the seller was great about it. And I know manufacturing is never 100% perfect, but I wasn't willing to try again. Bought something else."
2,Eh.....,"The quality of sound through my iPod was significantly worse through this than with my stock socket. Also, it made my socket stop working the 3rd time I used it. I don't know if it's just a blown fuse or what, either way- I was disappointed."
4,Good item,I straight wired the item with an in-line fuse and mounted it under the dash of my truck with the supplied hardware. The item functions exactly as it should. The delivery was expedient and the customer service was good. I would recommend the item to anyone who has need of an item such as this.
4,Good for RV,I added a LCD TV to my RV. I needed a 12 volt outlet for the TV. The Magnadyne adapteris perfect for my use. The USB charger ports are a bonus. I have already used them tocharge my Android and ipod.The mounting hardware plus the velcro tape made mounting the device under my video switchingunit a snap. I cut off the 12 volt plug that comes with the unit and hard wired it to my 12 voltsystem.
3,Multi-use but not as useful as it could be,"Product is well built and easy to mount. Despite its sturdy construction, none of the ports are adequately filtered electronically. Consequently, if you want to keep your mp3 player charging while listening to music, forget it! The unit picks up engine noise which plays through the speakers. So, as a charger, it works perfectly and is well made but..using it while listening to music: absolutely not. 4 stars for quality, 2 stars for poor noise filtering."
3,Multi-use car charger with USB port,"The charger works great and the USB ports are handy.I installed the device with the included adhesive pad.It fell off almost immediately as it is not nearly strongenough to hold the weight of the charger.There are also screws included with the charger, but Ihesitate to put permanent holes in the dash of my car."
2,Dosent charge a samsung tablet,"The first thing I tried to charge is a samsung galaxy tablet and it will not charge it, just shows a red X on the battery. I bought this for a road trip in 4 days and I was hoping this would charge everything. The description says ipads and other tablets, they need to be more specific."
4,Really great device,The last multi-port car adapter (not this one) I bought came with only asian writing on the package. It was flimsy and broke quickly. So this time I wanted to get a good quality adapter. I found it in this device. It is very well made and suits my needs because I have a GPS puck and cell phone that both charge with USB adapters.I highly recommend this product.
3,good product poor mounting,product works well but the velcro provided with it was sub standard. The adhesive separated from the backing within two days.
5,Amazing product!!! Plus great price!,This thing is awesome. Was able to hard wire it into my car by splicing into the cigarette lighter wires under the console. Used the screw-in attachments to stick it in a small compartment in my center console. No wires showing- Looks custom and works great!!!
4,Perfect for today's devices,"Just what I was looking for. Fairly compact, the long cord provides flexibility to mount it somewhere convenient. Now I can charge some of my devices with a regular USB cable instead of expensive and bulky ""car charger"" cords.Another reviewer noted, ""I installed the device with the included adhesive pad. It fell off almost immediately as it is not nearly strong enough to hold the weight of the charger."" With mine, the glue strip immediately fell right off the velcro. It seemed like the adhesive was defective or was stored at high heat. No matter, I just purchased replacement velcro strips at Target. Other than that inconvenience, it would get 5 stars. Dont' let it discourage you from purchasing this product though, it's really a great gadget."
3,Pricey but appears to be durable,"Bought this outlet in July 2009 and has been in my 2007 Tacoma ever since. It receives power 24/7 and has not failed. I have not put a heavy load on it; it mostly powers my dash GPS (Nuvi 755) and charges my Blackberry. It has also charged my iPod Nano and my wife's iPad. It is pricey compared to other similar outlets but I have not found one with the same outlets - two USB and two cigarette lighter outlets. Still, I think it i a bit pricey but that will not prevent me buying a second one to install in the backseat area of my truck for my daughters' increasing array of electronic devices (DVD players and iPods)."
5,Retro Fun,"Bought this just for fun, as I remember the show on TV so well. Great little set for retro toy collection!Highly recommended.MK"
3,Somewhat disappointed in this DVD,"The photo used on the cover of this DVD would lead one to believe it covers the Fleet Class subs of WW2. They really should have used a Nuclear Sub photo for the cover as that is the main focus of this DVD. The Nuclear Sub footage was probably filmed in the 1970's I guess so the ""look"" is somewhat dated. Why someone has never obtained the ""Silent Service"" TV Series (true stories of WW2 Sub action) from NBC, restored it and made it available to the public is beyond me. Price was right though for a somewhat dated look into subs."
2,Intro to nuclear submarine life,This video is a basic introduction to life on & in a nuclear submarine. It does touch & I mean touch lightly upon the earlier WW subs & some basic statistics about how they performed such a great part in the war against japan. If you are interested in a light glimpse into the nuclear sub except where only the priveledged are allowed then buy this dvd.
2,As a submariner's son....,Was excited to show this to my WW2 submariner father i was mare than a little disappointed on the brief content and details......there must be better books out there
2,"For cheeks only, not lips!","I agree with the reviewer who said that this product is better suited for the inside of your cheeks instead of your lips. These discs do swell, and if you place them on your lips, it will look like you have a breathmint or piece of gum sticking out of your mouth all the time.The product does effectively numb the area and protects it from food and other things, but the box should make it clearer of the places in your mouth that it's suited for."
1,embarrassingly poor lyrics,"i figured since this was a Ghostly Records release it would be good and while the music and melodies are fine, the lyrics cannot be unheard. Dykehouse makes Sum41 sound like W.B. Yeats.You're so soft / I'm so hard / Making out in your backyardOuch! No adult would ever cop to writing this; I'd have been embarrassed to write that at 16. A lot of people compare it to shoegazing, but it's little more than fuzzy, unashamed power-pop (and isn't that why we have post-green album weezer?). I deliberately deleted this album after downloading it. I cannot allow it to take up valuable harddrive space."
3,Dykehouse - Midrange,"Dykehouse is about a decade and a half too late: the great wave of shoegazing pop has long since passed by. But that doesn't stop him from reliving the glory days: the hazy guitars, the layered vocals, the wobbly, dreamy quality that had many people moping around. ""Drown Inside of Me"" sets the reverb on high and lets the music swirl around, while ""Chain Smoking"" revels in its somewhat silly lyrics -- as not to say that the shoegazers didn't have silly lyrics either. And despite the velvet qualities of tracks like ""Lost Holiday"" or the gentleness of ""Western Lands,"" I can't help but feel that this is music whose time has come and gone, and no amount of beauty will bring it back."
3,Retro sweet tooth satisfier,"This is a very impressive production piece for being recorded in a bedroom. It still manages to capture a slice of the My Bloody Valentine wall of guitar, the trebly drums, the muzzy-fuzzy vocals that occasionally float over the music and are occasionally drowned within the music. Its merits go far to outrun its debits -- most obviously the cliche-ridden lyrics.(Go back and listen to My Bloody Valentine lyrics, though, and you'll see that Dykehouse is not so far off the mark.)These are tight pop songs musically, and loads of fun to listen to. Stephin Merrit or Tim Harrington he is not -- sometimes it's better to turn off your brain when spinning this disc -- but as a shoegaze love letter to a bygone era, ""Midrange"" is a dizzyingly fun musical confection."
2,Mediocre dream pop,"I'm a big shoegaze fan, so I had high hopes for this album. I've only listened to this album twice since I've had it, so that should tell you what I think about it. There really isn't anything unique or special about this album. It's not that this album is bad, it's just not good. It also doesn't help that some of the lyrics are pretty cheesy. If you are expecting the next MBV, keep on looking, this band couldn't tune Kevin Shields guitar."
5,a must for MBV lovers!,"I actually didn't pick this up YET.....but the three songs i've heard sound a ton like My Bloody Valentine. i happen to very much dig MBV and all the bands that have emulated them, especially The Lillies. Can't wait to get my hands on this cd!"
3,A bit tough to get out.....,"Overall this is a decent product, but we had a bit of trouble getting the pops out of the molds (the directions say to squeeze from the bottom, but that doesn't work)! The problem was temporarily solved by running hot water over the ones we wanted to take out, but it's a bit disappointing to have to do that. I don't remember having this kind of problem with the old plastic ones of yore....."
1,Horrifyingly Bad!,"This is without a doubt one of the worst products I've purchased in years. It's so bad, that in my opinion the manufacturer is perpetrating a kind of fraud by continuing to market it. The chief problem with this piece of trash is that it is virtually impossible to get the frozen pops out of their molds. With great persistence and a little ingenuity, it can be done, but expect to be so frustrated that you'd just as soon throw the whole darn thing on the floor. It's inconceivable that Donvier doesn't know that this product is sheer, unadulterated rubbish. But they continue to sell it. If that doesn't tell you something about Donvier, then you should give your wallet to a responsible adult, because you're no longer qualified to shop for yourself. This product is garbage!"
3,functional but flimsy,"the plastic cover cracked the first time I used it (it takes a lot of stress as the stuff freezes and you try to turn the crank); still works but I am unsure how long it will last. It does make icecream fast! Keep turning the crank often, dont let it freeze too hard in place!"
3,Disappointed,"I've had this for sometime, but the same problem always creeps up--the ice cream freezes to the sides, and then the paddle sticks, and bends almost to the point of breaking. Sometimes the only way it will turn is backwards. I've even tried to turn my freezer down a little, but then it didn't freeze the ice cream very well (and I start out with very cold liquid). Even when the freezer is at its coldest, it doesn't freeze the ice cream very solidly. I'm spending my Christmas money on the Cuisinart electric one -- and this one goes into my next garage sale!"
5,25 years and still going strong,"I love that Donvier is still making this product. I've had one for 25 years!! Mine doesn't look the same as the picture, as they have changed the style a little bit, but it still works the same way. We still make fabulous home made ice cream, frozen yogurt and sorbet on a regular basis and have never had a problem."
3,Try an electric ice cream maker,"I don't have enough hands to use the manual ice cream maker. When I need to add an ingredient -- think chocolate chips -- I'm just not fast enough to get the lid off, add the ingredient, get the lid back on and start cranking again before everything freezes too hard to crank. I don't like noisy electric items. I have an manual coffee grinder and a manual grain mill. They both work fine (and give me a work out). The manual crank ice cream maker is frustrating. I wish I had gotten the electric ice cream maker. It probably wouldn't be collecting dust."
2,There are better options,"I owned one of these a couple years ago and decided to sell it at a garage sale. Like others have said, you can keep the bowl in the freezer and make ice cream whenever you want to. However, I found that I rarely wanted to stand there and turn the crank by hand for that many minutes. There are several much better options. Cuisinart came out with an electric powered unit. And KitchenAid makes an attachment for their stand mixes. I own the Cuisinart double bowl model. We absolutely love it and no more sore arms!"
1,It doesn't work,I have one. It only makes 1/2 pint at a time. It can only make 1/2 pint without being refrozen for another 5 hours. The ice cream that you get from it is mushy and 1/2 melted. It takes a long time of having to sit there and wait to stir it.
4,The Freezer Setting Was the Culprit!,"We've had this ice cream maker for years now, and I never could figure out what I was doing wrong- cranking it every 3 minutes, sometimes for hours, and nothing ever firming up very much. Yesterday, after trying yet again unsuccessfully, I was ready to look for a different brand, but decided to look through Amazon reviews, just to see if anyone had any tips I hadn't tried yet... and read about setting the freezer to a colder setting. Well. I put the freezer on the coldest setting, had the canister in there for about 18 hours, and zowie- was able to make perfect ice cream in about 15 minutes this afternoon. Whew! Thank you, Amazon reviewers! I would give this 5 stars, but agree with others that Donvier should include something about this in the directions. Would have saved me much frustration."
1,"faulty not once, but twice","I purchased this ice cream maker with great hopes and then opened the box only to find a large crease in the bottom of the container that would not allow the paddle to turn around. I used the ""call me"" button at customer service and THEY WERE GREAT!! can't say enough about how great the customer service was at Amazon. They sentme another one, plus a return label. Got the second one and it had the SAME defect, AGAIN customer service was there and gave me the same great response. I won't be prchasing another Donvier any time soon until the manufacturer fixes this problem."
1,"ice cream comes out well, terrible construction of ice cream maker","So this is a pretty basic piece of equipment. You have the canister you freeze, and the plastic housing, along with the blade and the handle. As soon as I took this this thing out of the box, the bottom of the plastic container fell off, and then part of the handle fell off as well(not the detachable handle used to turn blade, rather the handle that is supposed to be permanently fixed onto the plastic housing). TERRIBLE CONSTRUCTION, overall, do not buy this overpriced thing, I am sure that other manual ice cream makers out there do the exact same thing, probably with much less hassle, for a LOT cheaper than 65 dollars.-Jennifer"
2,disappointed,The thing would never stay put together when ever we tried to mix ice cream in it. We got rid of it.
1,"Not brand new, looks like a return item","Very disappointed, the handle is very easy to pop-off; surface has scratches, no receipt. I returned this item, not recommended!"
3,Not as FANTASTIC ...,"Whoa- this item was reviewed as a quick freeze and just wonderful item. First, it does not freeze as fast as indicated; no one mentioned that the inside cylinder needed to be stored in a freezer for @ least 3 hours before usage; instructions are not very explicit; and it is very difficult to get the sealing ring in place.If you do not have strong hands then you might find it difficult. I was also shocked that I paid such a high price for such an old product. Basically, it was a lousy purchase and shame on the person that sold it."
3,interesting & of moderate quality,This book does help identify pens to some extent. It often takes extensive looking to find information the reader doesn't already know.
3,First Time Collector,"I don't feel that this is a good book for the beginner. As a beginning collector, I am more interested in how to find and/or buy pens not how to repair them."
4,Great Reference and Table book combined.,"The history, photos, illustrations, and other content were great - the only deficiency was the lack of estimated prices for the pens."
5,Vintage fountain pens,"Fountain Pens Past & Present is an excellent book for both the new and/or advanced collector of fountain pens. The history of each of the major Pen Companies is short but contains valuable information giving the reader a usable history of the pen from the very beginning until the present. The photographs are excellent and informative. In addition, the advise given on beginning and maintaining a collection, judging the condition and value of pens in the marketplace, and other meaningful information make this book a must if you fancy antique/vintage fountain pens. I give it five (5) stars."
3,good book with NO table of contents,"A nice book, I was looking for a referance book, where I could look up different pens and learn about them.This is not the book for referance, it has NO table of contents, which is a real shame. Otherwise it would be fine."
5,Useful advice to the wouldbe collector of fountain pens,"This is a concise and extremely well written overview of the pleasures and pitfalls in collecting fountain pens. Considering its low price, it is an excellent value. It is an ideal introduction for the novice to collecting writing instruments, but also provides gems of information that would be of interest to anyone from non-collector to the intrepid long time pen collector,"
5,Acoustic Delight,"I had the unexpected delight last night of seeing this extremely talented quintet at Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music. Their fresh sound is accurately captured on this CD.Old School Freight Train has found a new recipe for making some very tasty music: Two cups of excellent song writing, 5 scoops of instrumental virtuosity (guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, upright bass), steamed together with the rhythmic sensibilities of a jazz band, served up with pop-right tightness.More creative than new-grass, more focused than a jam band, these guys sound like Nickel Creek meet the (American Beauty/Workingman's Dead era) Grateful Dead. Well crafted acoustic music with a focus on the song and the feeling makes this CD something special."
1,Not for the iPod Touch,"Despite the headline, none of the cradle adapters fit the iPod Touch and I don't trust my iPod to be supported by the connector alone. And once the cradle is connected, there is no way to plug in headphones or speakers. All around, a waste of money."
3,"Great Price for Useful Accessory, but adapters don't fit","The price was impressive, and the product works once you have it in hand. But be aware: The little plastic adapters don't seem to fit properly. I bought two of these (one for my iPod Nano and one for my iPod mini, for two separate computers).The cradles work great for syncing, and look fairly good. None of the plastic adapter fittings (from either of the two sets of them I ordered and received) would fit on the base unit with either of my iPods connected. It seems like they designed the product/cast the plastic just a little bit off center. (If somebody got this wrong and then spent money to manufacture thousands of these I feel kinda bad for them)So I just ignored all of the adapters and plug the iPods directly into the base unit. It's not as pretty, but it works. And it's a fair trade-off for a product that is so affordable."
1,Does Not Work!!,"This was very dissapointing! The attachments did not fit,they wouldn't allow the iPod to connect. If you put the iPod on it without the attachment and held it up to get connection,it still would not charge. Do not waste your time or money,go with an Apple Docking Station."
1,Clumsy Tool Kit,Many of the tools do not stay in place when you open the kit. They spill out and some are quite sharp which is a real hazard. The screw driver heads are not that great because they are not defined enough to successfully do the job.
3,Poor QC,"Does this thing smell funny to anyone else? It kind of smells like formaldehyde or something. Takes me back to High School biology.Anyway, one of the mini-screwdrivers was missing a small plastic piece on the end, and the bits for the regular-sized screwdriver are so soft and malleable that they're almost unusable. I wasn't expecting craftsman quality products with this kit, but I am a bit disappointed by the quality control and durability of the individual components.The whole reason I got this was to have a simple set of tools inside the house for random uses, so that I wouldn't have to go the the garage and get my good tools. It serves that purpose suitably."
3,tool set,"I bought this for to give to a high school graduate to take to school when living in a dorm. We buy this for all of our 18 grandchildren upon High School Graduate.However, this set is only satisfactory as the ones in the past were much nicer. They are hard to find."
4,Good for reasonable price,When I bought this item I was little bit hesitant but after I received this item it was very compact and full of daily life usable tools. I will definitely recommend others to buy this item if they are looking for some handy tools for their home.
4,very basic tools,"I think you could find another better one with 59 piece tool set. so if you could find better one. do not buy this one. I think this is not my best choice. but I would certainly buy another one if I saw that... The tools can fits to your needs in some cases, but still some pieces you would need. so ...."
4,Decent Product for Cheap Price,"First off, expect to receive a $19 tool kit. The tools are a little flimsy, weak, and not adequate for an avid tool user, but are great for a college student like myself who needs them for tune-ups on his bike every now and then. It's easy to tell that the kit is cheaply made, but once again, as long as you don't plan to build a house with it, you should get a good deal for the cheap price. This tool kit has lasted me 3 months so far and I'm hoping it will go until I graduate. I considered it a good buy."
4,Good but a really tight fit,"This tool kit is great for doing simple things around the house. The fit is a bit tight however, and it is very hard to get the different heads for the screwdriver back into the box. Otherwise, I am very pleased. Definitely worth the money."
1,Very bad,I recieved the product and then gifted it to my friend in India. He said that the magnet in the screw driver which holds the bit wasn't there and there was no use of the screw driver. I was very dissappointed. Now I cant get it back to return the product. I felt very sad bcos it was his birthday gift and he loved it actually. Please check the product after buying.
5,Ginger Is God...,"Being a huge Quireboys fan, I was reading some press on em' one day in an English mag; saw Ginger was booted out of the band for doing too many drugs...what a surprise! So after reading further and discovering Ginger now had his own band, I proceeded to order it off AMAZON. About a week later, the disc showed up. How can you combine metal riffs, pop vocals, great production, intelligent lyrics, and songs you can't get out of yer head? Hell if I know, but the WILDHEARTS have done it. Made me such a fan I have purchased all their goods. This is a great starting point for the virgin Wildheart fan. Why this band isn't on the radio is a no-brainer; RADIO SUCKS! But why the WILDHEARTS is not in everyone's CD player is an absolute tragedy. This band rocks and never will let you down. And just when you think you have em' figured out, they hit you with another revelation of brillance. God bless da' WILDHEARTS!"
5,Earth Vs Talent,"This is my all time favourite CD. I have listened to it all the time for years and there is always a new reason to listen to it.BUy it, you'll love it"
4,One of my favorites,Earth Vs. The Wildhearts is a hard rock gem. The songs have anger and humor and seem to remain very catchy.
5,AWSOME!,"I was going through some old CDs that I had stashed away for a while and came across this one. I played it and I have to say it's been in constatnt rotation in my car CD player for weeks! If you like Sex Pistols, George Therogood, The Ramones, Guns and Roses then you must get a hold of this CD somehow which I think is now out of print."
4,Excellent import-export primer.,"This was one of many excellent books I read on international marketing prior to starting my own company. I met Jack through this book and found we had a few things in common...humor, determination, a love for the deal, love of family, and above all faith.If your thinking of marketing your product globally read this book it is honest, informative, and filled with the fundamentals."
5,New Sheriff in Town - the Generator Record Label,"Howdy TEX,Wow, what a Breath of Fresh Air on the Music scene.I had to rush out and join the Michael Lee Austin Fan Club.Brilliant Marketing is Taking This to the Top of the Charts.I especially liked Track 4Say Hoss, I'll See You in Tijuana - down in Old MexicoTake Note UMG, Sony, WB, EMI, BMGThere's a New Player to Take Over, the ""Generator"" Record LabelYee Hah"
4,Crossin' Over ain't bad.,"I found out about Michael Lee in 2005. I'm a ""classic rock"" guy from way back, but there's something about Labor Pains that almost makes me wanna go country."
2,Garage band or Local Fair quality,"It turns out, this CD was a marketing gimmick to prove a point. I did not appreciate that very well personally. It just proves that anyone can publish a record if you throw enough money behind it. Beyond that, the music on this is not much better than a 20th place American Idol star. The singing is definately pitchy in many places and some portions actually made me cringe. I ended up giving the CD to my little cousin.If you dont have good taste or dont mind ""unseasoned"" artists, then get this. Otherwise, there are tons of other independent artists out there to listen to."
4,Toe Tappin Fun,Once you listen to this CD you can't help but want more. It's pure country fun. Easy to sing along with this cd put's a smile on your face and a tear in your eye!!!! LOVED IT!
1,Huh?,"This has got to be homemade. The backing tracks are canned,and the vocals are way to forward in the mix. It reminds me of a childrens record."
2,IT WAS HARD TO CONCENTRATE ON THIS BOOK.,"Although the subject matter was of interest to me, I found the numerous spelling errors very distracting. What a shame that more attention was not paid to the presentation of this book"
2,Poorly made wheel.,This wheel is inexpensive and it shows. The inner spinning wheel does not sit evenly and tends to rub the sides. This causes the ball to land in roughly the same area each time.I have no complaints regarding the other products included in this set.
2,low quality spring,"received the springs & was immediately disappointed there was rust in places & the powder coat was flaking off & missing in other places the level of quality control at the ProComp factory must be quite low the Rancho springs i ordered were much nicer, i wouldn't recommend ProComp to anyone, the price was pretty good but now i see why, value for money was not horrible but not good either , OK at best."
2,Does anyone know if Q.Rose has other work available?,She has an amazing voice and I can't seem to find any information on her. This soundtrack is very basic. The only reason I purchased it was for the two incredible songs by Q.Rose.
2,Am also looking for Q. Rose info,"Just like the previous reviwer, I am looking for info on Q.Rose. Her voice is magnificent. Please place any info about her here. Thanks,"
5,A Great Place to Live,"I moved to Vernon in 2002 and first rented the movie downtown at the video store/tanning parlor, next door to the Dixie Dandy and the old town hall. It is amazing how little the downtown area has changed since 1982. I love my new hometown and only wish I could have been around then to meet some of the stars. This is a classic documentary and just too much fun to watch. You'll be quoting your favorite characters for years to come.... 'That's a lot of water out there. Yeah, and that's only the top.'"
5,reality?? What's that??,"reality is suspended for the whole running time of this movie from the open scene with the bug spray truck and the kleenex and comb version of ""no place like home"" to the four track brain to the sand growing in the jar. One of my favorite films of all time and has almost killed many of my friends who laugh themselves to death. My wife and I repeat about reality all the time and laugh. It needs to be on every shelf where whimsy and amazement preside."
4,"Very true-to-life--if you are from Vernon, Florida! Amazing!","I grew up in Vernon, Florida, and I knew most of the people in the film. In fact, my mom was in the church scenes, and my dad found and gave the ""gopher"" to the old man. It is amazing to see these quirky personalities caught as they truly are on film. All of my life, I have tried to tell others what Vernon, Florida, is like and how it is so very different. The film could do that for me! I would LOVE to have my own copy of this, and also would like to purchase extras as gifts. HELP!!!!!!!!"
2,Quite simply put.... Boring,"I was expecting something better. Something funny. Something... just better. It is boring and drags on. The life of a little town in Florida, or almost anywhere. That summarizes it perfectly. Small town life."
2,"Southerners, save your money","Those raised in the South have encountered plenty of bumpkins; for Southerners, this documentary won't reveal anything new. It's just a bunch of codgers telling stories that they believe are interesting but that in fact are not. Overall an unimpressive film."
1,sound not acceptable,Could hear dialog even at full sound!!! did not finish movie!should return for refund! still not worth the nine bucks!!
1,not worth it!,"I bought this movie as a gift because it was recommended as a movie that people who have bought the Whites of WV DVD have bought, so I thought it would be close to as funny as that DVD...no where near being similar to that documentary. It just begins and ends and most of the people on it aren't so much ""funny"" as they are just old and senile. My grandparents are more funny than those people. I wasn't impressed and I wouldn't recommend that you waste your money."
1,Purchased documentary from amazon,"Thinking I was buying a story of the rural south, instead found it was a disjointed tale that made no sense. Not worth the the time to watch nor the purchase money"
2,Huge Audio Problem,"You have the turn the volume up on your TV extremely high to hear this movie, even then it's difficult to understand what they're saying. Also, at certain times (like when a truck is rushing past) you're treated with a full-blast of sound, shattering yer stinkin' eardrums.It's a shame, because it's a great movie marred by a technical isse."
2,"Unique, but not that interesting","Documentary from Errol Morris, made after his cult classic Gates of Heaven, and running at a mere 55 minutes; it's a miniature portrait of lower-income rural life in Florida, tracing the activities of several inhabitants of the small town called Vernon. At times the dialogue is unintelligible, and the characters overly esoteric and dimwitted to garner enough attention, but the film has a few interesting scenes such as the breathtaking opening and a bizarre sermon delivered by an absent-minded religious zealot. A fair work on the whole, and not up to the caliber of his other work."
2,Mean Spirited Satire Of Local Yokels,"Coming from such an acclaimed film maker as Errol Morris I found this documentary a disappointment. It's true that the stories of such eccentric characters as the turkey hunter and the elderly animal collector can be funny at times. But I found the whole thing rather mean-spirited, as you really aren't laughing with the people but rather laughing at them.The film's country bumpkins may be a revelation to viewers from big cities. But Vernon, Florida isn't actually all that unique. I live in a small town outside of Nashville and have some equally oddball neighbors. I'm sure many others in rural America can say the same.Fortunately, Morris found greater maturity in his later docs like ""Fog Of War"". But this early effort just seems to be the work of an elitist making fun of those he views as less intelligent. Skip it!"
2,"Something different, that's for sure","Many of the other reviews of this movie are glowing, and I won't dispute them. There are many fine features about the movie. Is it an interesting documentary? Yes. Are the people featured odd? Yes.So why, despite all of the glowing praise, did I not like *Vernon Florida*?There wasn't, so it seemed to me, a narrative thread. It was vignette after vignette as opposed to a cohesive narrative. And the one thing I want from a movie is some sort of plot. Even if the only reason for the plot to exist is so that one special effect after another can be shown.I suppose if I had approached the movie as a cinematic portrait, this cod liver oil of a movie would have gone down better. But I don't want cod liver oil when I see a movie, I want maple syrup--something unchallenging that might not be totally real. Should I want something a bit more edifying, I'll reach for a book.If wanting nothing more than diversion makes me a cinema philistine, then I am guilty as charged."
5,Exactly like it advertises,as long as you don't leave the caps off for more than a few minutes they don't dry out and it's very nice having extra black markers around
4,Beautiful looking in my shower,"Very nice looking unit, really like the thermostat, I just turn it on an get a great temperature shower every time without fiddling with anything. Got 4 out of 5 since the install was a little confusing, and I didn't like putting the black plate behind the tile. The pipe connectors stuck out the side, and every shower I've worked on (Both of them), feed the shower with vertical pipes, so I had to buy 90 degree bends, but loved doing screw in + shark connectors and not having to weld, since my welding (is bad)!"
5,Happy,I am extremely pleased with the purchase of these Blue Danube bowls. They are exactly what I needed for a small dish that is beautiful enough for a sauce or fruits and more.
4,Love these girls,"I love these girls. I used to listen to my Mom's copy of this when I was a kid and I'm glad to have my own now. Great EP. ""Runaway Love"" was a definite smash. I wish these girls would get back together and make some more records."
4,"OK, so it's mostly remixes...","and it's really short, but ""Runaway Love"" definitely contains some must-haves. The remix of ""Hip Hop Lover"" in particular is even better than the original, but you've just gotta have this CD for ""Whatta Man"". The title track rocks too!"
2,Disappointing.,Book was in great shape but it is more of the writer's daily diary. Not as helpful as we thought it would be. Not worth the money.
3,Could have been much worse off.,"I had to go through this as well, and what I would have given to just be paralyzed.In a way I was, but I was paralyzed from pain. The main effect it had on me was the wrong signals being sent to my brain. The slightest breeze on my skin would make it feel like I was burning alive. The lightest touch of a sheet was like razors. In the end I fully recovered, with much love and support from my family.I feel pity for anyone else who had to suffer this syndrome also, but it could have been much worse, and for many it was/is."
3,My opinion...,"As a survivor of Guillain Barre Syndrome, I personally did not care for this book. I realize that everyone is different, and perhaps I should pen my own account. My case was much worse than the author's, which may account for my disgruntle attitude. Sorry."
1,Dog Food Recall,I have two dogs that eat this food. Both got very sick off of it. The company offers a coupon or a refund for the bag of food. What about the $500 worth of vet bills I had to pay because my dogs ate this food???? I will never ever buy this brand again and would not recommend it.
1,Bloody diarrhea,"My dog did well with this food for about a year, but the latest bag we purchased caused recurring bouts of profusely bloody diarrhea, resulting in an expensive trip to the emergency vet. I later found that there has been a recall of this pet food for possible salmonella contamination. We've switched to another brand, and she's doing great. I think I'll avoid this one in the future."
1,Never received it!,"Never received the book! Asked about it numerous times but was always told to wait longer, that it would be here soon. Finally asked for my money back!"
2,Received wrong missal,"I received a missl quickly, but it was a Sunday one, not the weekday one I ordered. I emailed them and returned the missal. I haven't received a refund yet. Bill Michatek"
4,Large book,"yes, this missal is big. Its is very thick, but it does serve its purpose. I don't use it at Mass, as I use another form of Missal, but this is a nice book to have for home review."
3,Good Reference Source,"This missal would be an excellent reference source for lectors, homilists, etc. I would not, however, recomend it for use at mass as it is far to large and bulky for such purposes."
4,cozy indeed,I read two other reviews and also feel this cd is very sensual. And I to have enjoyed this cd with a ex-girlfriend. This cd has really nice sound textures and beautiful vocals. Some good up tempo dancey songs (but really chill) and downtempo songs. I wish I could find it on vinyl.
1,Doesn't fit all cribs,"This mobile is very, very cute....unfortunately it does not fit all cribs. I have a 3 in 1 convert. crib with the thicker bars and this mobile is designed to only fit the smaller bars. If you have a crib with smaller rails buy it! It is so cute....just wish it worked for me."
2,Unhappy customer,"I purchased this item because I though it was a good deal at the time. I am very busy and only listen to it about once a week. Needless to say, the cd player has already went out. It no longer works. I would not advise purchasing this product. It appears from the reviews listed there is a manufacturer defect with the product, especially the cd player. No wonder the price was reduced."
1,Another dissatisifed customer,"My experience mirrors that of others posting here.I purchased a Memorex unit for my son for Christmas.After 1 1/2 months, the CD player no longer works.I would strongly discourage anyone from buying CD player products from this manufacturer, and would pull the product."
1,A real dissapointment,"Right out of the box, the CD player was dead. The second one lasted a week before the CD player died. It doesn't take long to completely drain the batteries during portable operation....which is significant since this ""device"" consumes 6 ""D"" batteries at a time.Everything about this product is second rate, I am almost grateful the CD players died because it was easy to see that the buttons, doors and other moving parts will have a very limited life expectancy."
1,Horrible product,"Sure it's cute, but it doesn't work. My parents bought this for my daughter's birthday from a local chain discount store. (that ryhmes with arget) Everything seemed fine when we used the batteries. Then we tried to plug it in. It wouldn't work with the cord and then the CD player stopped working alltogether. We exchanged it for a new one and the CD player on the NEW one won't work either. I think I know now why the store was fully stocked with this. Everyone but us knew it was a piece of garbage! And it's no wonder all the other brands of purple CD players are out!"
1,Terrible Quality,"I purchased two of these for our grandchildren for Christmas, one grape and one blue, the CD player on the Grape one played for about 5 minutes and has never worked again. We did our shopping early and online so due to the strict return policies for online purchases we are stuck with a very poor quality product. I would not recommend this product regardless of the price."
1,"worked ok for the first few months, then everything broke","I bought the ""grape"" version of this boom box for my daughters, and it seemed fine for a few months. Then the first thing that happened is the door to the CD player on top broke so it remained opened all the time. The CD player still worked if we put a heavy book on it to weigh it down. Then the CD player went out all together - started playing all CDs at double their speed. Well, I figured I could at least use the tape player, but surprise, surprise, the tape player went out next. We've had it about a year and the only thing that works now is the radio, and even that doesn't work so well (reception is pretty lousy.) I would not recommend this boombox to anyone. We've had a Sony boombox for about 6 years and it is still working beautifully. Next time I think I'll stick with a Sony."
1,What do you expect folks?,"So what does the consumer expect for $36.00 which is around the cost of 3 new CD's? I would never buy anything with a CD player so cheap, especially as a gift that will just obviously sound terrible and have very poor reliability. Come on folks, don't complain it's your fault for buying ridiculously cheap junk!"
4,Entertaining and Informative Show,"I watched every episode of this season. It is entertaining and can be used for educational purposes. As host, Terry's quirky demeanor helps bring a certain endearing and down-to-earth feeling to the show even if he does get a bit repetitive and 'cheesy' at times (I counted no less than eleven times he used the word 'awesome' during one of the episodes). It is much better than a boring narrator that typically dominates historical productions. Furthermore, the experts used to get to the truth of these warrior cultures definitely know their stuff. Overall, I recommend this series and look forward to another season when/if they get around to it."
5,Warriors!!!,"Each episode delves into the mythical, social, and technological aspects of unique Warrior cultures: Mayan, Hawaiian, Samurai, Zulu, Viking, Malta, Sparta, German Barbarians, English Knights, and America's Special Forces."
4,dear hat ppl,"I like it a lot fits description very well. Very pleased! Fine product!I can't wait to start using it more, I have gotten the opportunity to wear in a little bit and so far so good :-)"
3,Okay.,"Has some interesting ideas. I personally only pulled about 15% of them for our household use. Wish it was binded differently, like spiral bound maybe. Be easier to go through."
5,great little book!,"i never would have noticed this book if not for amazon's helpful, 'if you like this book, you might like this one' comment. this book is one of those easy little, one page at a time quick quips with interesting, helpful ideas. i read it thru at once, and it gave me some laughs and smiles. worth every penny."
1,THIS WOMAN WAS CONVICTED OF ASSISTING IN MURDERING A CHILD!,"This woman was accused of helping assist in the death of a child during an ""ATTACHMENT"" therapy, and you want to listen to a word she says?[....]"
1,written by a killer,"Agree with the others. Bad book. Scary that the ""author"" was convicted of contributing to the death of a child."
2,A book with some very charming parts,"This was a bookclub selection , Jim Harrison was only able to convince me he was a female writer for the first few pages and then he fell apart with the way he wrote about sex. The vividness of the countryside and the greatgrandfathers diary were the best parts"
2,Very Disappointing,"The glowing reviews of this book compelled me to buy it. I regret this decision.I could not identify with any of the characters. Dalva is a character invented by a man who obviously doesn't have a clue as to how a woman thinks. I could not relate to or sympathize with her at all.Michael is a self-absorbed alcoholic who has a failing academic career and has the sexual maturity of a 13-yr. old boy.Naomi and her father-in-law were the only characters that engaged me and they were hardly developed in a satisfying way.The history of the Sioux people seemed to be thrown in as almost an afterthought, though this was the most compelling aspect of the book.Overall, this book was a disappointment even though the storyline could have made for interesting reading. I threw it away."
1,Our book club unanimously did NOT like this book.,We (all women) felt it was the way a woman should feel from a man's point of view. Felt it was very unrealistic. The only time we agreed unanimously.
3,Imagining Liza: Memoir of a Fan,"Nick Paccione's review was most interesting, and hit upon thoughts and feelings for his review, as I wished I had. Thank you Mr. Paccione, M-K-C/Creative Services ;-) Care to add anything Mr. Paccione? Please do!"
2,too hot on the ears,"- foam ear covering was too hot and the cushioning is inadequate.- the headset automatically adjusts to one's head. It is not possible to adjust it. I have mixed feelings about this. I didn't not notice it, but at the same time thought it might fall off.- The microphone is outstanding.- The USB did not work well. Sometimes the sound went through my speakers and sometimes through the headset. I could not understand the logic of it. I did not call tech support b/c of the hot ear foam muffs.I returned it and bought a $20 Cyber Acoustics non-USB headset that works well."
1,Bait and Switch,"This album claims to be the best of Bad Company, but it cannot be the `Best of' without Paul Rodgers, in fact Bad Company is not Bad Company without him. Make sure you read all the details of this album before making the purchase. I had to send it back!"
2,"BETTER IN PERSON, THAN ON DISK","Having seen Bad company live, I knew sort of what to expect from this cd, they put on a good show, with good clean sound, but not a lot of action on stage. One would think that the sound would come across on to cd. But it did not. This cd is dull. All songs are honest to the original versions, but they never come across as anything more than a different recording of the orginal. Stick with their studio recordings."
1,Terrible CD,"I bought this CD, listened to it once and threw it away. Brian Howe is no Paul Rodgers. The vocals are awful, only slightly better than the mastering. This CD is a travesty. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
1,Lame,Bad Company without Paul Rodgers? Save your money...have five gin and tonics and catch a cover band down at the local pub.
2,"Weak, but enjoyable","There is a funny thing about this incarnation of Bad Co. While songs like ""Holy Water"" sound great, just like the studio versions, songs like ""Bad Co."" sound like a BAD COVER band trying to play Bad Co. I saw Bad Co 5 times between Dangerous Age and Holy Water and while the shows were great, the original songs were NOT up to par (original meaning Paul Roger songs). Paul is back!"
3,Bad Company-'The Best Of Bad Company Live.....'(Atlantic),"By the time this CD was released,vocalist Brian Howe had been with the band for eight(8)years so it's a bit easier to at least 'sort of' accept Bad Company the way they are.I saw Howe with Bad Co. twice and this is pretty much a typical live album.More recent tracks here include ""How About That"",""Here Comes Trouble"",""Take This Town"" and ""If You Needed Somebody"".For some reason,these tunes seem to grow on you,probably because guitarist Mick Ralphs is STILL able to pen out good songs.The older/vintage Bad Co. cuts are nicely done,considering.Like ""Ready For Love"",""Rock&Roll Fantasy"",""Shooting Star"",their signature love song ""Feel Like Making Love""(show me a female that doesn't like this song),""Movin' On"",""Good Lovin' Gone Bad"" and ""Can't Get Enough"".My only complaint is that ""Shake It Up"" isn't on here.Nice cover,though."
5,Bad Company Live,"Excellent cd for those of us from ""back in the day."" I bought this one for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!"
4,"Tight, honest, no overdubs!","I picked this up a little while ago, not realizing Paul Rodgers was not in the band. On the jacket it says this performane is ""a true live recording"", in other words, no re-done parts or overdubs, everything you hear is exactly as it was performed. With that in mind, seldom have a heard such a nicely produced and well-played live recording. Only Pink Floyd comes close to this quality (and who knows if they re-do or overdub). If you like Brian Howe, this album is excellent. But I think it's almost too good - I preferred the edgier BadCo w/Paul Rodgers so this gets 4 stars, otherwise 5. Seriously, if you take out the crowd, this would sound like a studio album."
5,The Threshing Floor,The Threshing Floor is an awesome book. Even though I already have a strong prayer life it offered me ways to make it even stronger. Juanita Bynum is truely an anointed woman of God who dont mind allowing the Lord to use her to reach out to others.
1,No,I read this book and couldn't get through it. I am not sure what it is about her books for some reason they tend to throw me completely off track and I can't follow what she is trying to say. I would much rather hear her preach or even better hear her sing than to read her books.
4,Instructive in Leading to a Deeper Prayer Life,"This book's theme is that there are levels of intercession and a person can grow into greater intimacy with God. Jesus is interceding on our behalf continually and calls us to prayer for others. She applies Old Testament symbolism to New Testament principles.Another recurring theme is submitting to God's will and offering oneself as a living sacrifice. She notes, ""God requires us to lay ourselves on the brazen altar every day and say, 'Whatever doesn't please You, Lord, burn it up. Consume my will, desires, emotions--anything that doesn't line up with Your will.'""She goes on to describe how God will burn out of an individual the things that are displeasing to Him. This book describes how a pray-er can ""rise above natural circumstances and tap into the supernatural realm."" She offers encouragement and true spiritual growth."
4,Great Book!!,"This is an awesome book about prayer. Parts of it can be a little wordy at times, and if you've heard Juanita Bynum preach recently then some of the stuff in the book isn't new to you. But it' definately a book that will point you in the right direction concerning prayer."
2,Way over my head,"As a woman studying the three monotheistic faiths, this book made Christianity seem difficult and full of legalism. I thought while she was talking about washing she was going to start comparing it to Islam's process of ablution in which you must wash a certain way before each of your five prayers. I understand that it was symbolism, but the author makes it feel that you a praying in vain if you do not follow her exact steps. I always thought the point of being saved was to be able to come to God in a simple and childlike way. The book should clearly be called ""Intercession"" so that people who go to read it understand that it is for a different level of prayer apparently not available to most Christians."
5,The Threshing Floor: How to Know Without a doubt that God Hears Your Every Prayer- Juanita Bynum,"Have not completely read the book. Shared the book with a young lady, raised and healed from cancer, God is doing wonders in her life. She cannot put the book down, praise God for your steadfastness. Do not stop sharing the revelation that God has given you. This revelation has caused many bound to be set free. Thsnk you for Freedom as Dr. King gave His life for all men, Jesus gave Himself for us as He has used, is Using you to set the captives free. Continue in the Work. I declare that the power of the Holy Ghost cause you to release the fire of the Holy Ghost in every place you are. Thank you for being a wonderful representive of the Body of Christ. Inspired to pray for you as you go forth to rebuild the waste places, cause those that are lost to return to their first love, Jesus, and complete their assignment and fulfill their divine purpose in the earth."
5,Inspirational,A profoundly thoughtful book from an inspirational woman. Well worth the time and money.
5,Great Earth Science Posters,"I have these in my classroom, they're really nice and colorful. Somewhat on the small side, but they look good on the wall. It's hard to read the info on them once they're up, but I don't use them to teach, I use them more for creating a nice/colorful classroom environment."
5,good book,good book very informative with trial and error and book one you could actually build a working lathe. Just dont burn your house down and get the proper safety equipment. Especially if casting. Great book
5,Eye opening book,"If you want to make your own metal lathe from scrap, this is the book. The most sophisticated equipment you need is a hand drill and some taps."
2,not especially helpful,"I found this book confusing. I am relearning French after a 40 plus year hiatus. I did not find the explanations clear, nor did I like the diagrams. Personal pronouns are particularly difficult and made more so by this text. At my advanced beginner/intermediate level, I think there are better texts than this one and would suggest Practice Makes Perfect: Complete French Grammar by Heminway which I find more useful."
2,full of errors,"The book covers a lot of material and will undoubtedly be useful to somebody who has already learned the material before (but might have forgotten it). Unfortunately, the book has many many errors, sometimes in crucial places, and many of the summarizing charts are poorly conceived and designed. I suppose it does make one think carefully in order to untangle the correct information from what is written."
4,A mystery with charm and humor,"Amiable, enjoyable mystery, very much a product of its time (the 1940s). Jeff and Haila Troy are a young New York couple who stumble into mysteries, and then solve them, not unlike better-known characters such as Mr. and Mrs. North. Roos (a pseudonym for a husband-wife writing team) writes a readable, pleasant mystery that will keep you turning the pages. This installment also has some nice theatrical ambience. I commend Rue Morgue for bringing Roos back into print."
3,"good style/look, but low quality, thin glass, rediculous seam from the mold",the wall is thinner than I would like and the quality seems lacking even for libbey glasses. all of the smaller glasses have a very unattractive seam down the side and some of the larger glasses do. I think these are overpriced.
4,Nice set of glassews,I bought these glasses a couple of months ago and like them very much. Their odd shape somehow makes them easier to hold and everyone likes them even my wife.
3,Libbey 16-Pieces Swere Glassware Set,"The set is great because of conisting 16 pcs instead of the 8 that are offered in ths stores for the same price. The bad thing about it, though, is that almost every glass has a line running through it which looks like a deffect."
1,Disappointing results,"Ordered 2 sets. Unfortunately 1 arrived shattered. Since company selling stated they would not accept a partial return/replacement, both went back and I made purchase elsewhere."
2,There ok,"I love the shape and bought them because they were different, but the break very easily and don't fit very well in the dishwasher. I only have a few left from the set."
5,Attractive and sturdy,"Got these for my dad for Christmas since most of his glasses are broken now.. He loved them! I pulled one out before I wrapped them to make sure they were good quality, surprised at how solid/thick they were! I will probably end up buying some eventually and just throwing the ones we have away, lol."
4,Curved glasses,"These glasses have a unique shape and are easy to hold as well as interesting to look at. My only negative comment is, the seam in the glass. This takes away from the unique shape. They were inexpensive and nice for the money spent."
5,Unique and very stylish,This set of glasses is unique and very stylish. I looked high and low to find glasses that were out of the ordinary and these fit the bit. They were well packed for the shipping and were reasonable priced.
1,Untempered?,"After reading several reviews about how this glass was strong, I was quite surprised when the glass started breaking without abuse. Two glasses broke in my dad's hand. One broke in the dishwasher, one broke on my nightstand (left the room, came back and it was in pieces). I'm inclined to believe I got a bad batch as the rest of the reviews, overall, are good; maybe they just weren't tempered. Design is nice, wish they didn't have a problem but I'm afraid to use them as they break so easily..."
2,poor quality,"Yes, these glasses have a very cool design, but the quality is not very good. Most of them have a distinct line from top to bottom and some of the lips aren't even. I tried contacting Libbey by email and phone to see if they could help, but no one was home. So back to Amazon they go."
3,differant,They are smooth on the inside so easy to clean - they are unique don't you think - not tradtional at all
3,"Cool design, but kind of feel cheap","I like the way these glasses look. However, they feel very cheap and thin. Also they have a pretty clear seam along the glass that you can feel. Also the mouth is actually smaller than the base which I don't like. That being said, they are pretty cool looking and were cheap enough that I'm ok with the purchase that I made."
4,"Great Walkman, bad software!","Walkman is very good, but the software included to load music to it is absolutely a mess. Radio is an excellent feature and audio is very good. I'm an ipod user and was very difficult to transfer music to the walkman. I would recommend sony to place the holder on the usb cap instead of the back of the walkman and to include a lanyard with it. I've lost the cab twice!!! Thanks God I found it and the usb piece is covered. Other little thing: Is a little bit complicated to turn the walkman off. It is tricky!. But is a good and recommended product!"
4,Decent MP3 player,"When I got this mp3 player I was really amazed by its design and light weight. It's easy to use and if you pass through the Sonic Stage utility through which you has to upload your music to the device, you'll be just enjoying listening to your favourite song. I really appreciate that the battery life claimed by producer is almost the same as the one you'll be reaching in reality. In fact I found only one disadvantage of this machine. When you select to sort songs by artist and album, you can then see on the display only the name of the song or the name of the album either, but never the name of the artist during playback. And if the capacity is 2GB, you easily come to several songs or albums with similar names... Than it's hard to skip to song or album you want to listen at the moment without mistake. If you could get use to this incompletion, you can easily live with this mp3 player..."
1,freezing computer,"The software is freezing the computer, I tested it in my desktop and my laptop. And you can't transfer the files using the windows explorer, you have to use the sony's software."
1,Not an MP3 player,"It's elegant, but stupid and combersome. I was expecting to plug it and transfer my MP3 files and start listening to them, which I couldn't because it sofetware and propriotry music format must be used. Thus I cannot used it with any pc. I am returning it tomorrow and buying me a Creative Muvo V200 though its only 1G.It's realy a Sony Music Player and not an MP3 player, so beware before you buy. And shame on Sony; they should be aware of customers wants and not deliver a product this bad."
2,REALLY DISAPOINTED,"I really loved this player when I got it, I even read the negative reviews in AMAZON first BUT, I gave the mp3 player a chance cause' I have a Sony TV, DVD player, VCR, Home Theater PS2, BUT! 2 months after I bought it, the unit stopped working. Every time I tried to listen to the songs, suddenly appears on the screen ""file error"", I called Sony and they told me that they will replace the unit with an ""furbished"" one.I decided not to bother with sending the unit back since they said they wouldn't replace it with a new one - plus I was not happy at the prospect of paying more $$$ to have an item replaced which was less than a year old!!!I was hesitant to buy an Ipod, but I think I will buy one, really, really disapointed with Sony."
3,just average,"I was really expecting a lot from the mp3 player (I don't know why) but sadly to say I was slightly disappointed. It is nothing more than an mp3 player and flash drive.I can't see the screen in the daytime because it's too bright.The drive also cannot read Korean so the titles and artists come up funny.And if you are like me and used to an ipod layout you might find the navigation limited. You can only search by song or album, (the artist shows up while the song is playing)."
2,Good player - rotten software,"Plays ok, good tuner, but...Trying to get an audio book loaded was a pain. First try, wound up with the mini chapters loaded in almost random order. Used another ripper, copied them to the player and it would not play the files. Loaded those files through their software and got everything in order, but it removed the names and changed the MP3s to their pet format.Should never buy a MP3 player from a company that sells CDs."
4,This thing does not like VISTA?,"I am a Sony fan but i was tearing my hair out trying to get this to work on a VAIO laptop running Vista. Kept getting 000066a3 errors (Sony, please google this and see what other users have to do to get it to work, then fix it please). Anyway, was going to return it but then I tried the software on an XP laptop and it was so simple to use. Worked first time without a problem.Now that it is working, i love it! The quality of the earphone are not that great or comfortable compared to the new noise cancelling earbuds so I swapped it with some Sony earbuds and it is beautiful. The sound is great.The size of the unit and its design really makes it stand out. It is a bit small for my hands but the ergonomics is much better than the Ipods that give me thumb crapms trying to use them.The only reason it gets a 4 and not a 5 star is the Vista issue. Sony, please sort this out."
4,Small and Neat,"This is a very good device. I have used costly devices and it hungs sometimes. But this one is very neat. Only dis-advantage of this tool is the software which comes with Sony. As someone above suggested use Java tool JSymphonic available in internet. It is very light weight and it is Java, so it runs on any OS."
4,Sleek looking MP3 player,"I just got this today and it is a nice little MP3 player. Unlike the old Apple Shuffle I had (that died), this unit has some heft to it, which is nice.I've heard that the menu system is tricky to figure out, but I found it very easy and intuitive. The SonicStage software is quirky, but I've never been a fan of needing software to add songs (like iTunes)."
2,Nice and compact but does not actually play mp3s,"This is a very light and compact mp3 player. Unfortunately, it does not play mp3s! You need to use Sony's proprietory software to convert your mp3s into another music format before being able to play them."
5,Compact & Nice!,"People complain about sony's software, but it actually let you fit the same amount of songs as a 4 gigs Nano!You only have to drag and droop the songs into their software which transfers the songs really fast to the MP3 player!"
4,MP3 Novice,"I got this player close to a year ago. I really like it, holds lots of music, good sound quality etc. The downfalls are that you cannot see the display when in sunlight - like if you're outside for a run or a walk.The other thing you should be aware of is the sony software. I received an email from them last week stating that they are moving away from their ATRAC files. Will still be able to use their software to organize. I'm not sure of what that means long term for my MP3 player."
4,Excellent form factor but .....(Sonic Stage),"Small and light with a built in USB interface to boot which prevents the need of hauling an extra cable all around. Sonic Stage isn't horrible but locks your device to only 1 PC for transfers if you don't register...sucks. Another proprietary product forced upon by Sony.Controls, sound, and battery life are great on the other hand."
1,Not good...,It is not a good product and does not hold heat.... Only good thing is it looks good... They say that it is spill proof but it it actually SPILLS!! Avoid!!!
2,"contigo autoseal Elle Double Wall ""Insulated"" Mug","DOES NOT KEEP HOT THINGS HOT! I love the design, color, spill proof lid but thats it. I had coffe in it and the coffee began to lose tempature very quickly."
3,temp,I was hoping to be able to take this to work with the coffee fromHome and it still be hot but it starts cooling down right away it was a disappointment
2,Does not keep beverages hot for long,"I had previously owned the aluminum tumbler, which was terrific! It kept beverages hot for 4 hours and cold for 12 hours! The plastic tumbler did not keep liquids hot for more then 30-45min. I ordered in error thinking I was getting the aluminum tumbler."
3,Coffee mug,"It's leak proof, but doesn't keep my coffee hot for as long as I'd like it to. It keeps it warm for about half an hour."
3,NOT stainless steel interior!,"The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is that the interior is not stainless steel. I have ordered 2 Contigo Elle mugs, each with the same description (except for the exterior color). The red one IS stainless steel... the black is not. My husband decided to keep it anyway to use for water, since these are by far the best travel mugs ever!! They do not leak, period!"
3,"Good, but not as good as the metal version","The button top on this mug is the best feature and works well to keep your drink from spilling.But the plastic mug tends to pick up odors, while the steel version does not.Get the steel one instead!Contigo West Loop Mug -SilverContigo West Loop Mug - Blue"
2,If you like your coffee cool....,"I am satisfied with the spill-proof feature, the main reason I bought this mug. However, it DOES NOT KEEP COFFEE ""hot for hours!"" More like keeps coffee hot for minutes. My two dollar gas station mug does a much better job of keeping my coffee hot much longer than the Contigo."
1,Sleek Inferior Design,"I have owned this product for a month and would recommend against purchasing it. It may fit it cup holders nicely but it's height makes it unstable on flat surfaces. More importantly, my cup has leakage between the two walls after less than a months use. The seal works good when the lid is screwed on just right-check before use."
2,NOT thrilled! It leaks and is already building condensation!,"This product is not great for the price. It leaks (even when not filled to the top), there is condensation in the base of the mug, and it does not keep liquids hot!"
2,Not worth it!,"This does not hold much coffee and you cannot warm it in the microwave. I will say that the no spill top does work, as it fell out of the cupholder in my car because it was too big and didn't spill. I only used it for one week, as it did not fit my car cupholder and that was the main purpose I bought it."
3,"Doesn't leak, but doesn't keep drinks hot either.","Don't get the plastic version, go for the vacuum sealed steel version. Yeah, the plastic one's a bit cheaper, but my friend has the steel one, and it stays warm for a lot longer than the plastic one."
2,Not sure about this thing yet,"At the moment I've gotta give this thing 2 stars. First off it's hard to clean. The autoseal lid has lots of nooks and crannies for liquids to get stuck in, and the shape of the tumbler is tall and slender so getting your hand/sponge inside to clean is very difficult. Also the heat retention is not very good. I've been having to ""charge it"" by filling it with boiling water and letting it heat up for about 5 minutes then emptying and adding my coffee to try to keep it hot for an hour. It is attractive and claimed to be BPA free and that's why I bought it, but functionally it's not great."
4,"Works great, just not pretty","I am happy this cup does not leak, but it is not pretty and feels awkward when you are sipping from it."
2,Great function & look but all Plastic,"I like Contigo's the best. I have another one I got a long time ago like this in steel or whatever the type of metal it is they use. However I just picked up this one last week and have used it a few times. Since it's all plastic, the double wall doesn't help much. Plastic isn't seeming to hold up the hot coffee nearly as long as my other steel based Contigo equivilant which keeps my coffee hot for over an hour. With this one, I'm very lucky if it keeps it hot for 20 minutes at the most.Not worth it. Go for a better Contigo not made of plastic like this. Looks are great but at $10 you get what you pay for.I gave it 2 stars due to the materials used....obviously the Contigo functionality and design can't be beat in terms of usability and leakage protection."
3,BULKY,"i read the reviews before purchasing three of these cups. I dont think the color and design was true to the pics. Also yes they do keep ur beverage hot or cold, but i found them to be bulky and really stand out on a desk. I rather just have a regular sized one. These are really tall and with the lid over extending the sides it makes it even more bulky."
2,Not as advertised,"The description for this mug is not accurate. It claims that the mug is Stainless Steel when in reality it is PLASTIC. The mug also does not appear to have very good insulation at all because the outside is warm to the touch with hot coffee inside, and liquid which is too hot too drink will be luke-warm an hour or two later (no better than any of the free mugs I've gotten from various places).The only part I like about this mug is the lid, which does seal nicely, and is easy to drink from. As far as I can tell, this mug is identical to the ""Elle Contigo Mug - Red.""Product Description at the time I purchased this mug:Product Description16 OZ, Contigo Elle, Black, Travel Mug, Patented Autoseal Button, Press To Sip, Release To Seal, Lid Prevents Leaks & Spills, Stainless Steel Double Wall Vacuum Construction Insulates & Is Virtually Unbreakable, Fits Any Standard Cup Holder."
1,TOO MUCH EFFORT,"I got this mug after reading all the great reviews on Amazon, and it's been a big let down for me. I don't think this mug keeps the coffee that hot; mine leaked when I turned it upside-down; but the worst part of it all was that, because of the fact that it is called a ""spill-proof mug,"" the mug always stays closed. Some people might like that aspect. However, the downside is that you have to push the red button EVERY TIME (and keep it pressed every time) that you want to take a sip of coffee. And the button is not that easy to push. There is no locking mechanism to keep it open indefinitely. To me, it defeats the purpose of having coffee readily on hand to drink. It also makes it hard to hold the cup, because you have to hold it at the very top so you can push the button every time. If that doesn't bother you, then this should be an ok purchase. I don't like it at all."
5,The Best Travel Mug!!!,"This my favourite mug ever. It's super easy to use and it looks fabulous in red! The Autoseal Lid works great, no spils even in your backpack or tote. It's great when you have your hands full and don't have to try to keep the mug ""heads up"". I've been using it during super cold winter months (Jan. and Feb.) and it kept my coffee warm for about 2 hours. It would probably keep it warm/hot longer if I would use hot coffee, but I don't like boiling hot coffee so it perfect for me. Another good thing about it is that you can see through the walls how much coffee you have left so you know for sure when you need to refill. This is the travel mug that you are going to fall inlove with in fact yesterday I've ordered another one for my sister too!!!"
4,Very nice ... but,"Like this mug a lot , doesn't leak or drip. Made very well and attractive to look at. Only thing is somehow it now has a little bit of moisture buildup that can be be seen underneath the outer clear layer and the colored layer. Didn't put in the dishwasher or anything. It doesn't effect the way it works only the way it looks. Still like it a lot and would buy again."
3,Contigo Mug vs Contigo Stainless Mug,"I recently purchased the AutoSeal Contigo Double Wall Mug without realizing that it was NOT the stainless steel double wall mug. While this is a fine product, if you want your coffee to stay hot for a LONG time ---- spend the extra bucks and get the double wall stainless version. I have both and YES, it is WELL worth double the price for triple the holding time!!"
1,Doesn't do what it says it would,"The first thing I did when I received this mug is fill it with water and turn it upside down in the sink. Unfortunately the seal is not as complete as the mug claims, water came out. I have yet to find a coffee mug that does not leak. And the other reviewers are correct - it doens't keep heat well at all."
2,Not as advertised but does the job somehow..,"I purchased this along with a thermos Stainless King. My intention was to use this for my daily coffee, placed in my workbag. First time i filled it with hot water, it started dripping when i turned it upside down to test. (Not very encouraging!) Other problem i found was its not very stable as it has a very high CG and can easily topple if placed on a tray (i had it topped up on an aircraft and the attendant complained that it toppled and spilled her other drinks etc). Now i can only use it in my car cos its slim enough to fit into the cup holder. Wished i bought 2 Thermos Stainless King, those rock simply cos it keep coffee hot 5 hours more than this one!"
4,Favorite Mug,I like this no-spill mug very much. It works very well and is attractive in appearance. I am saving money by making my coffee and carrying it in to work with me in the morning. My only suggestion is that Contigo make a larger hot/cold travel mug.
2,Not so hot,I am disappointed in how quickly my hot coffee gets cold. This was the main reason for buying these travel mugs. Description says it keeps hot beverages hot for over 4 hours. Not even close. I do like the fact that I have not had any issues with spills although the button gets harder to press each time I wash it.
3,Good information,Good start as a resource for people who are play writers. It is dated and I hope some of the contacts are still operational.
5,AWESOME,"Great music, great artist and an amazing voice! The songs are very catchy. I never get tired of listening to Mozella!"
2,Just not my thing,"She has a decent voice but the songs on here are all kind of slow, sad ballad types. There isn't anything with kick, anything with energy. Thankfully I borrowed this from the library and didn't waste my cash. I did buy her other CD, Belle Isle . I had heard a couple of songs off it and liked them well enough to splurge. It's a pretty good CD, not sure it rates the rave reviews but alot more energy and fun than I Will."
1,"confusing, poorly written","This is one of the worst textbooks I have ever had to use. It is confusing, poorly written, and incomplete. Russell and Norvig contains virtually all this material (plus much more) but present it in a much clearer way."
2,"teases, but never delivers","This book was frustrating in some ways. It start giving details about parts of AI, then it stops. It covers to much material, and with not enough detail. It does list the references, so you can always go there and get more detail.If you have a decent background in calculus, then the mathematics in this book should not be that daunting. If you are a philosophy major trying to learn about AI, then you might find this book difficult.I really don't see much difference between this book and some of the other intro to AI books on the market. They try to cover to much material and something is bound to be left uncovered or superficially covered."
2,Russell and Norvig Exponentially Better,"The title of this review speeks for itself. Unfortunately I had to buy this book (Nilsson) for a course. I still refer to it at times, but only as a last resort. If you have a choice go with Russell-Norvig text."
3,Not a good intro to AI,"While the book is well organised and number of topics covered is substantial, this was the worst intro-to-anything book I had to suffer through. If calculus is something you are very comfortable with, then go ahead, read it. :-)"
1,Run Forrest Run,"In general avoid this book.I purchased this book for a course, and unfortunately this is my first book. Its 95% maths, of course AI is a lot of math, but the book is so abstract and nothing related to practical stuff. Take convolution filters, it gives integrals and all that stuff, but what exactly does it do, how does it perform it on images, and where the heck are sample images, and sample matricies.I bet this author must have sent this book out to teachers so that 50 students would have to buy this over priced book with no practicle use and so hard to read/understand and extremely dense."
2,"""Original Recording"" is a warning . . .","Kudos to Hallmark for the front-cover stamp that brags ""Original Recording."" That it is, complete with all the distortion; thin, monaural sound; and paltry liner notes (song titles and authors, folks; that's it) for which the original Pickwick label was infamous. The only aspect missing is the off-center pressing that made the original 1963 LP's overall pitch waver up and down exactly 33-and-1/3 times per minute. True, most of these songs have not appeared on any of the other greatest-hits re-re-re-packagings that plague London's catalog. Completists may be hooked; the rest will likely pass on such mid-level material as ""What's Your Story, Morning Glory?"" (not the Oasis hit) or ""Every Day I Have the Blues"" (the B.B. King signature). For the best of London, bridge over to any of EMI's ""two-fer"" reissues, and their remastered sound, real liner notes, and London's signature, sultry sound - all the elements that Send for Me forgot to send for."
4,"plain chess pieces at a good price, but no nice box","the box is a cube shaped box that barely holds all pieces--it is not a green felt lined box with cutouts for each piece as the picture shows--other than that it was an ok order--and I guess a good value for the price-- the pieces are a larger size but do not have alot of detail but then again the price was very low,,,,"
2,Not what I thought,"I'm not sure why, but I was also expecting a board with the pieces. The pieces don't stay in the box as nicely as shown. The pieces are OK but not what was expected. Better sets out there for a similar price."
1,Are we there yet?,"First, this book contains some excellent information on Entrepreneurism in the ""information/computer"" arena. I have made it the required text in a graduate class I am teaching. Having said that, this may be the most tedious book I have ever read. To quote a representative sentence taken from page 122,""The technological strategic planning process provides the new venture team with a method of focusing the enterprise formation process, and is crucial in commercializing any technological concept."" The book is written in Dissertation-ese. Approach with large pot of coffee."
1,What the.....,"I'll preface my review by stating that I'm not an entrepreneur, I had the book for a class. I'm not really sure what the purpose of this book is. Almost every paragraph is referenced from somewhere else, leading me to wonder if the author ever had an original thought. The diagrams are either far too complex or convey no real meaning, and it seems like their only purpose is to illustrate the author's competency at using block diagramming software. The editing is poor: there are many misspelled words and rambling sentences. For example, the front cover misspells ""angels,"" referring to angel investors - look at the cover picture here. There is some useful information in terms of corporate structure, but it's probably information that could be more easily obtained elsewhere."
4,"A decent little read, but ...","Let me say at the outset that I like the book very much. The author writes in an amusing but informative style, and a lot of the buzzword topics of J2EE are covered nicely.I was disappointed though with:(a) the marketing of the book: demystification, yes, but to a point. Few examples, and some topics (like EJBs and JMS) are very ""light-on"".(b) the price of the book: $73 is expensive for any textbook.I think if the prospective buyer understands that this book is totally non-technical, very short, and is virtually a ""Websphere for Dummies"" book then they'll rate it 5 stars. If you want something to explain Websphere and J2EE concepts with greater significance then look elsewhere."
3,Not enough for your money !,"OK, so I know more about Websphere than before I read the book. It was simple to read and understand. It cleared up alot of questions and broke down Websphere to basics. But it left me hanging in different areas like MQSeries for the mainframe and distributed systems. The book is only 270 pages with a page size 5 1/2 X 9"", that means if it had more standard size pages like 8 x 10, it would probable be around 220 pages, which is like primer-size. In otherwords $73, for a primer is way too much. If you're in IT Audit, this book won't help."
2,Prepare for the sales job,"This books is pure tongue in cheek hype--but it's also the only comprehensive overview you'll find on defining what ""websphere"" is and does. Here's the big spoiler--ready? websphere=EJB..."
2,This book is Just for a J2EE beginner,"This book is Just for a J2EE beginner and not very much. Portal itself given part of the Book Title but how much portal Author covered ?, How much Web Services ? What about complex Transaction Management ?For a beginner this Vol 1 is OK"
2,$66 pocket reference,"Odd that they would put such an exorbitant price point on such a small book, I was expecting one of those doorstopper sized books Microsoft products usually get but this isn't much bigger than a pocket reference. I'm sure all of its sales come from online shoppers unaware of the size; I can't imagine anyone picking it off a bookshelf and forking out this amount.2 stars because, despite the poor size/price ratio, as a pocket reference I like the layout."
3,"Good book, but overpriced and needs a proofreader","This book is a good introduction and overview of WebSphere, but for the price I paid, I was simply amazed at the number of typos, grammar, and spelling errors. With all the money this author is making on this book (and I think it is overpriced), one would think that he could afford to hire a proofreader and clean it up. Just for fun, I kept track and found 50 typos/errors while I was reading, and since the book is only 280 pages long, that's one error every 5 pages! Poor quality, if you ask me. Although the content is helpful and well organized, the multiple errors give it a sense of being unprofessional."
4,Great WebSphere book!,"I attended IBM's WebSphere Application Server 6.1 Administration class and came out semi-stunned, having begun to learn a whole new language with J2EE and WebSphere. This book should be required reading prior to the class!! It explained things in English (or as English as possible given the topic). What a great complement to the class!"
5,Highly recommended for fans of spicy Asian dishes!,"Burmese cookbooks are hard to come buy: there are relatively few in print, and this joins only a handful of competitors to bring the food of Burma to the modern kitchen. Fine color photos of completed dishes supplement dishes which do require access to an Oriental market, but which are surprisingly easy to produce. Fans of spicy Asian dishes will welcome this Burmese presentation."
4,pretty pictures,"This is a cookbook I probably wouldn't have bought it I had been able to flip through its pages before hand. I always avoid cookbooks with color pictures of all the food since color photos seem to always mean they are trying to distract you from other problems. Since Amazon gave me a great discount on it with another book I was considering getting, I went for it. In the end, I'm not dissappointed.The first 36 pages are info about Burma, and I must admit the color photographs are all excellent. The recipes call for a lot of ingredients that are hard to come by in the small town where I live (small enough that butter is sometimes hard to come by), but they also look great. They are layed out well, and are easy to read. Some ingrediants have alternatives, but not nearly enough to make this usable by people who don't live in metropolitan area with specialty stores."
2,Pinnacle PCTV 100e Review,"Right now I'm only using the device for my video capture needs using the Studio 9 software and relying on Nero Digital for video editing which is very basic and functional. I still can't figure out how to use the remote control. I've re-installed the installation cd hoping it could be fixed but still no remote control function. When I tried capturing video using the composite/s-video input function of Media Center program, it produced a 1/4 duplicate video at the bottom of the screen which is unusual. I'll give the softwares that go with the device 2 stars for ""user-friendliness""."
3,Spiritual Book,"This book came highly recommended to anyone grieving the loss of a loved one. I appreciated that it arrived quickly; and I read it immediately. While I did not find a lot of solace in the book, I did find it somewhat helpful. Again, Amazon had the book readily available for order, and I received it very quickly."
3,Too little for too much,"First off, I want to say this HRM has been with me for a few years, and has rarely let me down. If you want to see your heart rate the Polar A5 does it.Issues I have... the watch only lets you see one important stat at a time, either heart rate, stopwatch, or time of day. Most other watches in this price range have the option of putting at least two of these on the display at once. The strap needs to be replaced when the batteries run out. Nowadays straps should be battery-replacable. If you separate the watch from the chest strap for a few minutes while working out (like when I put the watch on my bike on long rides) the HRM will refuse to pick the signal up again when you get back to your workout, needing you to restart the whole monitoring session.I'm going to try one of the Timex watches. My Polar A5 served me well, but it's just out of date and overpriced."
1,heart monitor,This watch did not come with a battery which was listed but when we went to the jeweler to get a battery we found that the watch itself was broken. now we have to mail it back and try to get our money back. I am very disappointed.
5,I'm pleased with the necklace,"I bought this necklace not really knowing what I was getting. It ended up being the perfect size and length and so much cheaper than similar necklaces I've seen in the department stores. If you don't mind that the cubic zirconia 'diamonds' are tiny and that it makes the circle look like cut-work rather than 'real diamonds' I think you'll be pleased with this piece of trendy jewelry.I also must give kuddos to the company for it's quick service and delivery, I received it within 3 days of the order.I hope that future orders from this company yield the same affect."
5,Got your sights on a bargain!,Great scope well worth the money.sights great .Only tesyt of my modding skills was it went on a Mossberg 715t with carry handle .If you get it for this rifle and it doesn't sight its not the scope its the angle of the mold in the handle. just add a small piece of foam behind the bolt between the scope and the handle and tighten . I used everyday available Manco (any brand will do)door window trim and cut a small approx 1-1.5 in piece and tightened down sight perfect and shot as accurate as my dad's 100 dollar scopes.
2,"Good idea, bad execution, cheap","I was pretty excited with this product upon first inspection. I have a 4x carry handle scope by Accushot that works perfectly. Upon unboxing you will notice that the mount is screwed into the scope with cheap looking and cheap feeling Phillips screws. The lens is ruby tinted as per the item description. The clarity of the glass is decent, however, the image does have a very blue look. Now, mounting to the carry handle is where this product really lost my rating. My other carry handle scope fits like a glove. (Bushmaster 223 stock carry handle) This scope would not sit tight or flush regardless of tightness of the bolt/screw. The scope was easy to move around by hand once mounted. There is absolutely no way you could hold a zero. I returned the item without firing a shot. Perhaps this scope will mount solid with some carry handles, but certainly not mine."
2,Junky scope,"This scope is large and cheaply made. The rubber looks pretty tacky. But, what do you expect for 30 bucks? Probably wouldn't waste my money on this since there are better products for not much more."
2,Ok For Its Time,"This book may have been ok back in the early 2000s but it hasn't aged well. It's written for someone that's totally unfamiliar with the Internet, which would be somewhat unusual these days and, crucially, there's no mention of Web 2.0 or social media, let alone Facebook. Fair enough, that all came later but, if you're looking for a PR book to buy, you really should get something that's a little more up to date."
2,Guerrilla trapped on the Web,"It was very interesting to find out about Guerrilla PR from Levine, who seems to have a very good ""offline"" experience. However, as web designer and Board member of three Internet companies, I found Levine's Internet content shallow and full of Net beliefs that are not accurate or updated."
2,"Good cover and paperback, but everything in between is disappointing...","I could take out a handful of (minor) good ideas out of this book. Consider the time I invested in reading it, I would say not worth it.I am pretty much a newbie to P.R., and I think most of the ideas inside this book will come quicker to you if you use common sense.Some rought guidelines who to interact with the press (DON'T SEND MAILS WITH SUBJECT LINE ALL IN CAPITALS; be persistent when pitching but accept an no for an answere; journalists and producers are busy people, so contact them only if it is newsworthy, never lie to journalists, try to figure out the schedule of the person you're contacting, because if you call at ""rush hour"", you will not be able to make your pitch; find out how people like to be approached before you do your pitch (some like email, some fax, some snailmail, some phonecalls, etc.)"
1,Not A Good Book,"I have been planning to run an online business for a while now. To gain some better insight I thought I would seek out a few helpful books that may put me a little bit ahead in the game.Unfortunately this book was a complete waste of time and money. And as anybody who has ever run their own business knows, both of those elements are crucial. But at least as bad investments go, a poorly written book won't set you back too far.I can't speak for the rest of the population, but for the entrepreneurial type, you would be wise to skip this book at all costs (unless you are one of my competitors--then by all means buy this book and follow every example it teaches!).-John Wilkins"
1,skip this one,Adding 'guerilla' to the title does not a good book make. There's nothing unique about the advice given here that you can't find in any other book on the subject. Save your money.
3,A Good Overview of B&W Photography,"This is a good introduction to and overview of black & white photography for beginner and intermediate photographers. Although most of the material in this book can be found in other photography books, it is well-presented in this book and accompanied by good photographs. If you already have several books on black & white photography techniques, you won't likely find anything in this book to justify the purchase, but if you're just beginning to explore black & white photography, this book is a good place to start."
4,Nice Coverage,"I have had this book for close to 3 years now. When I bought it I was just getting into c++ so it was kind of difficult but as I got more comfortable with the language I started to appreciate this book for what it is. This is a good buy for anyone who wants to go into ATL programming. I was especially happy with the coverage of connection points structured storage and enumerators/collections.The coverage of these topics was a great help when I was developing a DOM and SAX implemantation for an XML parser I am writing.However considering the .NET move in today's world this book may become a dinosaur soon but for anybody who needs to write ATL code, this is a great buy.""ATL internals"" is propably the best ATL book though."
5,A very good buy,"I have only recently started using COM in my applications, and needed a good book to explain not only COM/DCOM but also ATL. This book is a very good, step-by-step, readable resource that should help any Borland or Visual C++ programmer. I am a Borland C++ Builder user, and the book uses mostly examples and source from Visual C++. The author explains the concepts in such a good way that I have had no trouble at all using the Visual C++ compiler and I was experimenting away in no time. The book also has great DCOM sections, explaining all the nitty gritty and extra features in simple english.This is a must have for anybody who wants to get into COM/DCOM and ATL rapidly. Great book!"
1,One word: Sucktacular!,"I found numerous errors in the sample source, and not all the referenced projects were included on the CD. To top it off, in the one chapter I really needed, only the most basic project was included, and I couldn't glean everything else I needed from the text. Only buy this book if your dining room table needs a 2"" shim."
2,Mistakes like this are unacceptable,"To be fair, I have not read the entire book. I bought this book and ""Developer's workshop to COM and ATL 3.0"" and I read the threading model part in both, cause I needed to find something out straight away. To my surprise, Bates mentions in page 168 the following: ""(Windows shares time slices between processes, not theads!)"" (the exclamation mark is in the book). Call me weird, but mistakes like this really bother me. I begin to question the author's credibility and when this happens, I can't enjoy reading a technical book. I keep thinking that maybe something else I read is going to be horribly wrong and I don't like to have to question everything (too time consuming). As far as explaining threading, the ""workshop"" book is MUCH better. 2 stars is the top I would give if the rest of the book is excellent."
3,"Fabulos fabric, horrible fit","I could not agree more with the other review submitted about this product. I have purchased the pima cotton form 2xist for many years. It has just been the last 4-5 years that the cut and finish has become unacceptable to me. Yes, the arm holes are cut on an angle and they ride up your arm pit as the day goes on. Yes, it may look like a muscle shirt, but come on guys this is an undershirt designed for comfort and to protect shirts. The last time I bought 4-5 of these was about a year ago and the banded collar becomes puckered after several washings. This looks horrible with an open collar shirt. The fabric and weave is superior to tees costing much more, but the fit and finish are far from what they were in the past. I am looking for an alternate!"
2,Not worth the money...,"The cotton used for this t-shirt is awesome, but the cut and fit, especially in the arms, is not good. Specifically, the arms are cut too short and angle off too much in the underseam. The shoulders have slight bumps at the edge, as they go in to the sleeve. So, while the feel of the cotton for this t-shirt is great, the overall value is very poor from as cost and fit perspective. I would not recommend this t-shirt to anyone and will not buy them again."
3,Lacking,"ONLY(guitars, congas, bass, drums. PERIOD)It would be a fantastic CD if the band would've had some horns..e.g. there are no saxaphones or trumpets..The REAL Curtis Mayfield fan will recognize this because Mayfield is not only NOTED for his LYRICS, but for Particular MUSIC SOUND..I'm still a huge MAYFIELD fan, but was disappointed on this one."
4,Please don't automatically thumbs-down my four-star review,"Curtis/Live! has been called ""one of the greatest concert albums ever cut"" by a soul artist. It's very good, but not quite that good. The band sounds wonderful, and there are enough great songs to have made a single-LP that would have been a ""greatest album ever."" But the full double album contains some songs that, though they have a great groove, are lyrically or melodically weak, e.g., ""Stare And Stare.""The song ""People Get Ready,"" which is strong lyrically and melodically, is a good example of the kind of magic Mayfield and his stripped-down band worked in concert. Unfortunately, not all the material on this album is as strong."
5,Cnations will go around the world,I don't have this cd yet but I know it will be very good and I can't wait to buy it cause the song THE ONE Rocks!!!!!! ohh and the video is sooo awesome I wish they would play it more on mtv.
1,"ONE advice, go home.",I think that we had had enough of Shakira this latest years and we need a brake from her. Maybe in the U.S she's a brand new singer but sience 1996 we (latin people) haven't stop hearing her and we're tired. I think that she should take a vacation for at least a year and then comeback with a new album. But in the meantime she shoudn't release any other single.
3,Pleasant music with the familiar Ray Conniff touch,"I first heard this album almost 50 years ago at a high school friend's house. Even though it was his parent's album, the music appealed to me immediately. I bought the LP myself years later, and finally the CD being reviewed. I wouldn't call it great music, and I don't play it all the time, but I like it, and didn't hesitate to buy the CD."
5,Great horns and great arrangements!,"If you enjoy the arrangements of Ray Conniff and the trumpet of Billy Butterfield together then this is a C.D. you will like!The C.D. is entertaining all the way minus the stylings of Ray Conniff's singers. This was the first of two albums with Ray and Billy. The second one came out in 1963 which also featured this duo in more melodies.""Conniff Meets Butterfield"" features some good uptempo tunes and some on the relaxed side. Enjoy!"
5,MAD MEN is AMAZING :),"MAD MEN is amazing! I bought seasons 1 & 2. I already have seen them, so I know theyre great. I bought the two seasons online for My fiancee for Chrismtas, and he was delighted. :) A+"
3,"Men and women in the 50s/60s, their relationships","Found this series quite fascinating more so because the protagonist was a perfect example of a male chauvinistic pig!!!The women are still of the helpless type but have no qualms about flaunting their sex and wanting it.But the men are the worst. They want to lay every female but then a DOCTOR to whom a woman goes for contraceptives, along with her prescription she gets a lecture about the risks of becoming a ""loose"" woman!!The storyline is good and well played out and in spite of the above makes compulsive viewing."
3,As Described,The item arrived with a great deal of expedience! Upon inspection it was as described. Overall very pleased with my purchase!
4,"Good, if somewhat stodgy","The National Geographic guides suffer from a desire to be all things to all travelers. As such, they provide an appropriate introduction to the areas they cover. There are, however, better guides with better photography available; better books of history of the natural wonders of our country. This volume is no exception. It makes a good coffee table book and, if you're only barely thinking about traveling to the canyon, may very well whet your appetite."
3,GREAT PICTURES BUT SHORT ON MYSTERY,"This NG guide is rich with photos of the canyon's majesty, vegetation, and wildlife, but short on history. Much of the book detailed the author's voyage down the river. Having bought this book at the Grand Canyon I can say with authority that the photos in no way capture the beauty and magnificence of the Canyon. While there I couldn't stop staring into it and walking around to various views. The light of the day changes everything and gives a whole new perspective. Looking down into the canyon calls you to explore. One day I'm hiking down there.There is much more mystery and intrigue to the Grand Canyon than is contained in this book. Overall, just OK."
4,ok,"showed up on time and works well! packed well and speedy delivery by the UPS man, installed and working great."
3,works but....,"It is typical coax cable, and works, but...one end fell off and had to be replaced because it wasn't crimped properly."
1,Bad bearing unit fell a part and my return date is over.,I assumed Timken was the best. Due to time issues I had a 5 Star Dodge dealer install my parts. This one fell apart on them after removing from packaging. There unit cost me a bundle to purchase OEM from Dodge. The mechanic also informed me that THERE PART was slightly more Heavy-duty? So now I am stuck with a paper weight.
4,Entertaining and educational!,"Santa brought this to my 6-year old son for Christmas last year. I wasn't exactly sure how it would be received, but my boys are so into dinosaurs I thought I'd try it out. Our entire family has been pleasantly surprised by how much we ALL enjoy Prehistoric Park! Nigel Marvin is hysterical--and he teaches you so much about how dinosaurs really lived. And the computer graphics are so life-like, I keep having to remind my boys (and myself) that it's not real. I just got ""Chased by Dinosaurs"" for my son's birthday, and now he's obsessed with that DVD (another with Nigel Marvin). Prehistoric Park needed a rest :o)"
4,Great dinosaur book for kids,My 8 year old son loves the Nigel Marvin dinosaur shows and absolutely LOVES this book. He has been reading it every night. I would recommend to any parent with grade school children who are interested in dinosaurs.
2,Just another sequel in the Dino-Theme,"The plot is a total non-sense. Well, you can guess that from the DVD title, but the story could have been used as a guideline to more useful information. The movie has no beginning and no ending, nothing is explained or justified, and you keep asking yourself the purpose of such Prehistoric Park."
5,FANTASTIC!,"We saw this on TV and had it on our PVR, but the PVR decided to delete them so we were fortunate enough to find them on DVD. My two year old loves this series, and is spouting off names like 'parasaurolophus', 'dinosucus (spelling?)', etc...Can't say enough good things about it, I can also watch it and not be bored after seeing them a couple times.. it's very well done. We want more!"
5,Watch out Nigel!,"Within this collection is six episodes on two discs about Nigel Marven going back in time and bringing back prehistoric animals for a park in the 21st Century. I really enjoyed how the technology and methods used to make the Walking with... series have been used to help this adventure in time and space. I am also happy that animals besides dinosaurs were selected to help fill the park. Evolution, the changing environment, the social needs of some of the animals were all touched on and are important issues when dealing with such a wide range of animals, prehistoric or otherwise."
5,Love love this movie!,"I love this movie, and especially my 5yr old son! He is crazy in love with dinosaurs, and this movie gives him ""hope"" that when he gets older, he too can build a time machine and go back in time to save dinosaurs!! haha!! I do think the ending episode ends a bit like a cliffhanger...but that's me being an adult. Kids don't think twice about it. haha!! I highly recommend this movie for your children!"
5,be careful with this park!,this movie is great for dinosaur lovers. see gods art work in almost real life.
1,What a piece of du du,"This movie could not have been worse. An entire movie and maybe 3 or 4 laughs the whole time. The romance story was absurd, the acting was awful, the story itself was ridiculous. The dancing... dancing? Well, I guess that is what they were doing, why couldn't they get some real break dancer to sit in for these no talent actors.Don't rent or ever buy this movie. It has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (top 20 worst) and I grew up in the 80's. The references to everything 80's was amusing, but the movie was so obnoxious and stupid, that it detracted from it. A movie that could have been funny and good turned out to be such garbage.Better to be in a coma during the movie than actually watching this trash."
1,"A few laughs, but mostly it was lame.","Predictable plot, tired and repetitive jokes, it was so lame at points, but I predict this movie will become a cult classic in 20 years because it is so campy. We checked out some of the special features, like deleted scenes, man, they are so much worse than the movie that they are almost funnier than the movie because they suck so bad. The trailer for this movie was not bad, you could probably edit this movie down to a funny short film, but it just does not have enough good material for a feature film. Just watch the trailer for this movie, don't bother watching the whole thing."
4,Kipin' it Real!,"I grew up in the 80s, and this was really a blast from the past! It was unrealistic, corney at times, and definitely won't win any movie awards, however what ever happened to watching a movie simply for fun? It made me laugh and brought back all those 80s memories that I miss so much. Life as a child in the 80s was simple, without all the modern technologies (aka hassles). So, sit back, relax, and get ready for 80s nostalgia. Enjoy! Funky fresh boyz FOREVER!"
3,Brings back great memories,"Anyone who had the privilege of growing up a child of the 80's will find this film moderately funny. It has all the classic nuances that made the 80's! Garbage Pail Kids, Smurfs, Break dancing and Star Wars! How could you go wrong...? In short, if you want a short break from reality and want some great laughs, check it out!"
5,Loved it,"Ok first of all, I was born in '81 so of course, I am biased via the nostalgic 80's toy references in this movie. I liked the cast, everyone seemed to know their role pretty well and either made you laugh till you cried or made you hate them. Rosenbaum's villain is easily one of the most hateable people you'll ever see as he plays a sassy, rich boy, conceited bully that seems to have no soul. And the ""homeless guy"" is one of the characters that make you laugh out loud when you're quoting his lines months down the road. SO MANY memorable lines in this one! One of my favorite comedies in my collection."
4,Kickin it old skool,The only thing I didnt like about this movie is it was widescreen I prefer fullscreen....but other then that the movie itself was 5 star...
4,Polar A3 monitor is dependable,"I've used my A3 for 4 years, works great and is very dependable. Wetting the chest strap helps with conductivity of the chest strap. The battery in the chest strap is replaceable if you send it to a Polar approved repair shop though I'm tempted to pry it out as it seems [...] bucks to replace it is a bit steep. Mine is still going strong after 4 years."
4,Excellent choice,"Easy to read, acurate reading (even w/o glasses), it helps me with my workout.If you don't want anything high tech but looking for something worth your workout, this item is it, **NOTE** It DOES NOT count your calores as the description says."
3,"Nice, but you can't replace the transmitter battery","I have used this monitor for about a month now for running, Spinning and indoor workouts. It has performed flawlessly. It would get 5 stars except that the transmitter (the half of the monitor that you wear around your chest) does not allow you to replace the battery. Buying(...) I suppose it is a disposable consumer product."
1,monitor breatks,"The monitor broke shortly after a year, and it has only a one year warranty. It worked well enough while it worked. But sometimes it would give my heart rate as 225. I don't think so!"
1,Sarah Coventry Jewelry: An Unauthorized Guide for Collectors,"Without repeating myself, I would just like to say that I agree with everything that the above person said about the book. I was disappointed to find a ""collection"" of pictures with several repeats and no names even attached to the items. I could have put together a book like this with my own Sarah Coventry jewelry!!"
1,Sarah Coventry Jewelry Book from Schiffer,"A real Waste. This book was purchased for dating and naming information. Which it does not have. It has nothing but pictures (well, okay, a COUPLE of items have date references and names). The book wasn't cheap and the information I was searching for was not there. I actually noticed in one place where the item pictured was NOT the name referenced. Someone who is really in the know needs to write a book with ALL the information pertaining to the Sarah Coventry Jewelry items. The prices listed were completely unrealistic and not the going market prices on these jewelry pieces. NEW*******December 2012-Published by Schiffer. Sandra Sturdivant has co-written the absolute BEST book on Sarah Coventry Jewelry, with the help of Bill Stuart (original owner's son) and original company records. I recommend This book at ANY price! A real must have."
2,Enjoyable but,The production is rough around the edges. Patricia Rutledge is great but one can see why the othersupporting actors were altered for the 'real' series.Enjoyable for those who are fans but in honesty not the best......compared to the series over four years.
4,Entertaining,"Slightly predictable, but well written romance. It kept my attention throughout. The author made me care about the characters. I will be purchasing other books by this author."
3,"Good plot, well written...","This was a well written book. The plot was nicely developed and flowed well. The hero was every women's dream guy. Handsome, sensitive, loving and caring. The heroine was a different story. She was an uptight, bitter control freak. She was constantly rude and insensitive to the hero. I did not like her at all and couldn't believe he put up with her emotional detachment for as long as he did. If you can overlook a distasteful character like this then it is worth reading."
3,"Good premises, boring execution","I liked the beginning of the story, but after 2/4 of the reading the book became repetitive and boring. In particular, Sam's character became annoying. The likeability of the two main characters was further compromised by the last turn taken by the story. The logic and the heart should have advised them, as a young couple, to look after a baby and not to leave her with an old woman, no matters how healthy she can be. In conclusion, at the end of the story Cal and Sam strike like selfish, self-centered beings, not at all my favorite blend of romantic characters."
4,Nice romance,"This is a nice reading, well written but do not think it is realistic. I liked it very much as an escapist reading. I had a very nice moment with this book. So if you like romance, I think you will like it. It has all the ingredients. Beautiful heroine, gorgeous and succesful heroe, problems falling all over them, the heroine has had a difficult time when she was a child. And what I liked the most, the hero is very sweet."
3,The heroine really got on my nerves,I enjoyed the book and loved the H but what stopped this book from being great was the irritating h. I must say that the author would have done well to lighten her up a bit earlier on in the book. I was in danger of not caring at the end.
4,"Sweet, but realistic? Hmm...","This story was really nice and real, all the way up until the ending. I feel like all the conflicts were resolved way too quickly. It's a nice little read, but don't expect anything more than that."
4,"Likeable characters, Enjoyable read","Likeable characters, although Samantha's waffling annoyed me at times. Interesting plot. I appreciate the marriage twist, their growing relationship, and how Cal & Sam had to figure themselves out separately before they could be back together."
3,Lovely!,A beautiful story filled with love and hope and compassion.I wander how many secrets can we hold close to our hearts thinking we are strong when in truth we are just scared to let others in our lives?
3,maybe i've just got horrible balance. . .,"these boots are cute, but they are quite hard to walk in. i've had other shoes with heels this high but for some reason, i didn't feel so awkward. with these boots, i wouldn't go anywhere in them where i had to walk a lot."
3,Smaller than expected,"These are very nice looking boots but they are really narrow (very tight on my calf and I do not have large calves) and they run quite small (at least half a size), so I couldn't wear the ones I bought."
5,Convenient,"This product is exactly what it sounds like, it allows you to purchase points directly from amazon, and enter in your given code immediately from home."
1,I lost $20,"It was very disappointing to get my code in a hurry living overseas since there is not other way other than purchased cards only to find out that I have spent $20 for a ""Silver"" membership which is free. I have asked for a refund so we will see how Amazon responds to spending $20 for a membership that is free to create on xbox live anyway"
1,Way Overpriced,"I wanted to play a few online arcade games, and the selection is nice (Sonic, Sonic 2, Street Fighter 2, etc); however, for 20 dollars, this card only gave me enough points to cover 1.5 times the price of 1 of those games. This is bull honky, and for 20 bucks, I expect more than 1 outdated video game.If Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo would open up their eyes and realize that the only reason people turn to emulation and ROMs (which I'm sad to say that I have, at times) is because they really try to stick it to the consumer--price-wise--on games the consumer has already bought on prior technology. If these retro-games were available for something like $2.00 each, I would buy a ton of them. Until then, compilation discs are still a better bet for your buck. I would suggest Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection instead, found here:http://www.amazon.com/Sonics-Ultimate-Genesis-Collection-Xbox-360/dp/B001G3AZS2/"
2,rip off,Rip off. I would not buy again. What you get with the points is downloadable crap. Do not buy. To expensive.
2,this not good buy,"This microsoft point is fakement,redem code is wrong,not posible to activate mrvosfot point on usa acount.i live in czech republick,400 poins its not available to buy,but 1000poins cost 113dolars,this for czech peple 115dolars,kurs 16kc for one dolar.new game cost 115dolars,1800-2000kc.but gold membership is perferkt.and very good price."
2,Hello,HelloI want to queryIs the symbol will be sent through the mail and be sent to your address?Thank you A. .. terrible service
1,Lame,"The fact that we need to buy Xbox live points is stupid to begin with. We buy the system the Xbox 360, and we pay 70 dollars for the games, and now we have to buy xbox live gold cards to play online and then on top of that we need to buy gay points cards to access content and new maps for our purchased games.....BS. Expected from microsoft though. When we buy a game it should include free updates, new maps etc."
5,Definitely the way to go,"I have ordered both the physical card (for gifts) and the online code - I have to say that THIS is how I will get my points from now on. It might not be instantaneous (though the online code is close - a few minutes at most in my experience), but at least Microsoft doesn't get my credit card info and auto-renew things on me at inconvenient times. :)I've also not had any issues with codes not working. - This is definitely the best way to get your points."
5,Amaaaaazing Service!!!,"I live in Saudi Arabia and unlike my Playstation 3 Account, I was unable to use my Credit Card to purchase anything through XBox Live (bacause I'm not in the US).I can barely find time to play and thus, couldn't find the time to go to a local gaming store and buy a ""Points Card"".Thanks to Amazon, I got to get the Online Gaming Code from my Office in 2 minutes.Amazing Service."
4,Amazon has great deals on these cards.,Normally you have to pay 19.99 plus tax for one of these cards. I snagged one for under 17 bucks with no tax. You need these cards if you're buying DLC for your xbox games.
1,Card did not work !,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, He told me about a week later the card would not work, I told him to send it to me then I would return it through Amazon. Well I guess I should have stayed on top of this but I didn't , so when I looked up my Amazon account the return policy has expired this might be a unique situation I don't know how often this happens but it happened to me , 50 bucks down the drain and disappointed nephew . Any advice out there ? I have very little experience with Xbox 360 points are for that matter the system in general , any help would be appreciated . Thanks"
1,have not got online game code and i ordered 20 mins ago,i want my money back if i can not get on line code please hurry i want my msp so i can use them on my xbox 360
1,Non-Refundable,"I got Microsoft Points as a gift from someone and when I tried to return them at Wal-Mart since I don't exactly need them for anything, they told me they were non-refundable and that I cant return them. Microsoft why did you have to make up so currency for your store its just stupid. It would be much easier if I could use my visa on your store instead of buying stupid points then sometimes having left over points I don't need."
1,just points!,"Nothing speical. The point is useless, this is why I will purchase it. Microsoft always makes us money as fast as possible."
4,brownie points? haha,I am not a gamer and have no knowledge in these but since they were supposedly on sale at Target during black friday and my friend wanted it I got this with my points. Not sure how useful they are for xbobx but now my friend won't be leftout if one of them don't have an extra map/add-on? hahaha......
2,Why cant i use my giftcard to make this quick purchase,So i have 10$ to get that 800 ms points but to get it i need to have a credit card wtf i have 10 dollars in my account
5,As described,"No complaints, received 800 pts as described. No waiting for 24 he's or anything, was able to use my code and purchase something right away"
4,Surprisingly Quick and Painless,"Getting Xbox Live points via Amazon was a very simple process. I recently received an Amazon gift card, so I decided to try it out with this. It took all of about four minutes for me to receive my code. The reason I rated this four stars instead of five is because I was still required to enter credit card information even though I was paying with my gift card dollars/points/spacebucks. I can certainly see how some people would be opposed to this.""Fun"" was rated two stars out of five because I'm not in favor of the convoluted ""points"" process. I would much rather buy games/DLC directly for a clear price (as opposed to the $5 = 400 points setup). Also, I hate having leftover or unused points."
5,Fabtastic,"awesome, nothing else to say they are points... no surprises here. I love that you can have the code emailed rather then waiting for a shipment"
4,Not bad.,"The points do the job, I'm not sure there's another way to review them. I definitely wish they'd change the point-to-dollar ratio, though."
5,cool,No problemAll I cared about was if the thing workedAnd it worked and shipped pretty fast so I don't care much bu t it worked like it was supposed to so I am OK with it
5,Cheaper and Safer than buying from Microsoft,"I bought this online because I do not want to have my credit card information stored in Xbox Live. Also, I did not want to pay for tax so buying from Amazon was cheaper. A great gift for any gamer because the points do not expire. Points can be used to purchase downloadable content including games, movies, music, etc.."
4,Commodity item...,"Amazon is about as well as you can do buying these, much better than giving Microsoft your credit card info, once you do it's almost impossible to remove it from your account!"
5,sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is awesome you can buy so many things with 1600 points with this I got sonic the the hedgehog 4 and alot of other stuff I reccomend this.
5,instant,I loved his because you instantly get your code and have your microsoft points immediatly. It was a very smooth purchase.
5,I was charged sales tax but got working code immediately,"It charged me $3 sales tax. I read the instructions, followed them and had my code within a minute, I would call that almost immmediately or at least close enough for me. great service, no card on file with Xbox Live, can't beat it!"
4,Same thing...,"I don't get it buying this online is the same thing as it is on Xbox tax was still applied, i was hoping for no tax."
5,Just like it says and didnt have to leave the house,"Well, need I say more? I didn't have a pc for a long time, but just purchased one and have been shopping on amazon ever since. This was so easy and convenient."
5,Instant points for $1 less!,"The 1600 point cards at the grocery store scanned ""recalled."" I wanted to buy them there to get points on my grocery card but since they wouldn't scan, I decided to check Amazon. Glad I did. It was $1 less than the grocery store and on Xbox Live. I wanted the points for DLC and if you purchase the ""online game code"" from Amazon you get the code instantly. After you purchase, the screen automatically loads with the code. You can either print it or just type what you see on your computer screen into your 360. Simply go ""my accounts"" and then to the ""redeem code"" menu. It took less than a minute. No tax and you save $1, good deal."
5,Quick & Easy way to get Microsoft points,"Wow, I was surprised how quickly I had a game code & that I was able to use it immediately. I had no trouble and it was very easy. Only part that I didn't like was that I had to enter my credit card number first, then it let me use my Amazon gift card balance at check out."
3,Hope this helps for non-working codes,"Three stars because I tried to redeem the code on the internet thinking copy and paste was easier. Did not work, Amazon couldn't help and told me to call Xbox. Xbox suggested I redeem the code through the console and it worked. Thought I'd save a dollar and buy here, but ended up wasting more time than worth the dollar saved."
4,if cheaper better,"Excellent and super fast way to get MP.However, amazon should decrease the price a little bit, because they do not have to mail the card."
5,easy peasy japanesey,Need points on the fly to rent movies on zune or buy game content? Cant beat amazon download code. Instant code without leaving your couch. Couldnt be easier.
5,"Fun rating really doesn't apply, but...","...this is a great Christmas gift for that person you know (maybe a family member) who has every gaming system, and buys pretty much well all the ""major"" games that hit the stores (i.e., the ones most likely to eventually have paid download content. There are also several neat arcade style games available on XBox Live that these cards could be great for."
5,"If you need points, this is what you need.",The 2400 point card from Microsoft is a perfect amount for the gamer who wants to buy multiple games through Xbox dashboard.
4,i like it,even though i like it i gave only 4 star because there was a problem at the transaction but still it's okay
1,I Can't used it,"I put the code online and console indicates invalid code, talk to Microsoft and say they need physical code card to help and that if she, the codenot working"
1,Didn't work,My code didn't work. went to gamestop instead. First and Last time I use Amazon. Except when I use it for free apps on my Kindle.
1,Never worked,I EMAILED YOU GUYS ABOUT ITWAS REDIRECTED TO XBOX CUSTOMER SERVICE.THEY DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.NOW IM OUT 10 BUCKS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT WILL MAKE ME NEVER DOWNLOAD ANOTHER CARD ONLINE AGAIN!
1,Its ripped me off,dont buy it. i bought one a couple of days ago .it took out my money but didnt give me the code. it ripped me off dont buy it.
3,I love all the options out there but the cost is prohibitive,I just hate that you need to pay for access to Xbox live gold and on top of that buying all these points to translate into Microsoft dollars is getting ridiculous. I think Playstation does is much better with free network access.
5,Always need microsoft points,"Standard purchase, you need MS points, you purchase MS points. Buying in bulk quantity is your best bet. You will always need MS points. Every game releases DLC that requires MS points to purchase."
3,pricey but you cant find better anywhere else,"pricey but you cant find better anywhere else. its Microsoft, what do you expect? i just dont like that $20 wont get you 2k points"
5,xbox points,"As much as i hate giving Microsoft more and more of my money, the great price on amazon got the job done. Also they give you the code right on the spot."
4,Good,"fast, good, safe, easy use, no problem, low price. play game now have more fun and happiness. will buy next one soon."
2,Where is it?,"I figure buying the online code would be faster, but apparently I'm wrong, i've been waiting for 3 hours, and still have not received my Xbox Live Point Codes..."
5,Great gift!,Bought this as present for Christmas! I'm sure it will go to good use! He loves playing his Xbox!! No problems!
3,"Good service, but they need to include Amazon Gift Cards as payment.",The service is good. You can get the code instantly by email. The main problem is that you can NOT use Amazon gift cards to buy the code. It requires you to have a credit card. It's a shame that Amazon Digital does not accept Amazon Gift Cards.
1,Microsoft Points/download code,"I wish that it stated that it could take up to four hours to produce the code, before I bought it! Really? If I would have known, I would have never ordered it to only save a dollar!"
1,código inservible,"Código inservible lo coloco y me dice que ya caduco o que coloque un código valido, recomendarlo; no podria...Tenia muchas intenciones de seguir realizando descargas, creo que lo pensare..."
1,"Seemed good,","It won't let me get the code, nor can i cancel this order. I guess you should always buy these in person at a store."
1,I did not get my stuff,I ordered two 4000 point codes and a 1600 point code and i only received one of the 4000 point codes i did not get the other 2 codes
1,BS,"Yeah, no doe, crappy waste money. Might as well buy the whole 1600 microsoft points if you want a good bargain."
2,MS Points,We know what they are and what they are for. I wish it was dollar for dollar instead of mind games with points. If you get burned buying content you are told to contact the company the released the content. When you contact the company they tell you to contact Microsoft for a credit because you paid them... It's all a trick!But we sure do love our XBOX to take those chances. Enjoy!
1,el codigo ne me funciona,compres este codigo y no me quiere funcionar vivo en colombia y no hay una direccion de mail donde quejarse persi 90000 mil pesos
1,CODE PROBLEM,"I PUT MY CODE AND DOES NOT WORK, I get a message to enter a valid code. When it came MAIL WITH THE CODE, USE IT. ANYONE KNOW IF I HAVE TO WAIT TO BE ACTIVE?"
3,1600 MSFT Points,"Basic 1600 microsoft points... spend it wisely because they fly quickly... only bought a theme, a gamerpicture, an episode of family guy, and 2 xbox live arcade games with it, it needs to be able to buy more"
1,BOGUS GAME CODES!!,"Although this is the 3rd code I have purchased from amazon.com, the code I received for the 4000 points was not accepted by xbox live. When I asked amazon about the bogus code they sent me a generic email stating that since I had already seen the code, that there was nothing they could do, and I needed to contact xbox! Now I'm out $50, and still have no points. I would suggest taking the time to find a paypal dealer for online instant codes. They are harder to find, but any problem I've had with them, they have found a quick and easy solution."
1,Delivery takes too long,"Decided to buy this card online since i did not feel like driving out to a store. First disappointment: paying tax. Ive never had to pay tax before on these point cards when i physically buy them, but I decided to plunge in anyway.second disappointment: it's been over an hour and i still havent gotten my key and i have no way of cancelling my order since it is ""processing"". the only reason to buy this code online is to get it quickly and efficiently, yet the code delivery is slow and unreliable.Thisll be the last time i download a digital code from amazon."
1,18 hours,"after waiting 18 hours and several calls to amazon later, they finally told me that they were out of codes and would refund my money... so all that time just to tell me that they were going to screw me over and im not getting anything...then after a week and a half to two weeks i finally got my refund!!! i would go for the card from now on!!!"
1,What a load of crap,"Such BS that they've stopped selling online game codes. The xbox marketplace, for whatever reason doesn't like my credit card, so I can't buy points there. And Amazon was always so convenient, being that I don't have a local place to buy cards. Definitely going to put and end to my point purchases, though I'm sure it won't affect their bottom line any. Still though, quite frustrating."
1,bad code,The code I received has already been redeemed. There's no place on the order to contact the seller. Now starts the red tape to get my money back.
1,Microsoft points,I have problem with the point card that I bought recently from Amazon.com. The problem I live in different country and the cod isn't valid as the massage is telling me. I browse all the site to find way of complain I cant return it since the cost will be high so as the time. How they sale damage or incorrect cod and wasting my money? I hope they are showing some concern to their customer and respond to me. So this gift to my son in his school break turn to be bad idea.
1,Invalid CODE,"Today (Purchased on May 05, 2011) i buy xbox 360 Live 1600 microsoft points (online, Not card) the seler send me code on my email, this code is not valid! send me new VALID code or Give me back my money!"
1,What's the point?!?,I was so happy when this service released until I found out it can only be used by people inside the US.Stupid if you ask me since I can buy pretty much everything else on the site.sucks.
5,Not much to say...,"I needed the points to buy a game, it works... Wait I do have something to say I find it better to buy Xbox LIVE 1600 Microsoft Points because of the ""Online Game Code"""
3,Microsoft continues to find ways to steal money from me...,This was a good buy from Amazon. But I still can't believe how much money Microsoft is milking out of our economy. Send some money to my school Bill Gates!
3,Service needs major work,"It says it will take only a minute, then after 5 minutes it errors out and says it will take several hours. And calling the customer service center produces no real results. Just a hard to understand underpaid individual telling me the order will take a few hours, and will either fail or succeed. Well of course it will either fail or succeed, what other option is there..."
2,Not so immediate as advertised,"So there's nothing wrong with the card, however, Amazon advertises immediate retrieval of the online code, and it is not the case at all. In reality, you can spend up to 12 hours waiting for the code. Also, while you do not pay taxes through Amazon as one reviewer pointed out, I don't pay taxes when I buy from Gamestop either, so if you really wanna buy and play something now, you should go elsewhere."
5,Excellent!!,"Great idea! Instant access to the code, no waiting for shipping. You can use these MS points to use with the Xbox 360example: download movies,games,videos,Gamerpics,Gamertags,Download new maps,weapons,game types,themes, etc."
5,Buy Here And Save Money,Why buy direct from Microsoft when you can save here. Excellent transaction with fast shipping and substantial money savings.
3,not instant,"I ordered this for my son to be able to add points right away, but it has been over two hours and still no code. I would have just taken him down the street to gamestop if i had known it was going to be this long. the problem is you cant cancel your order."
2,to long,took way to long how long does it really take to get a code read it think it would be fast not up to 4 hours lol what a joke i guess thats what i get for reading that would be a digital code sent to me instantly
5,incredible convinient,"quick and save way to buy your MS points, works right away. And it is environment frindly because it will not be a printed paper."
5,Awesome Deal,"Great price, worked easily, and was emailed instantly to me, so I could redeem the points quickly. Came in a denomination that is not always available at stores."
5,"INSTANT, EASY","CHEAPER THAN NORMAL??? YES!! INSTANT? YES!! the only con is that it doesn't come in different quantities, but for anyone looking for 1600 points anyways, this is a GREAT buy!"
5,Worked perfectly!,It was easy and fast ot purchase the online game code. Great way to get around the problems that sometimes occur in Xbox market place.
5,Works Great.,"A super easy way to get instant Microsoft points for your account, and you don't have to worry about putting your credit card information on Xbox live and getting hacked. This is the second time I've purchased an online game code and it has worked perfectly both times."
1,Do not waste your time,Do not waste your time. The purchase is buggy and you will end up fighting customer service. Buy direct from microsoft. https://points.microsoft.com I doubt they will post this review but maybe it will save some people the headache I had.
1,Geographical Location restrictions.,its unbelievable how you can't buy the microsoft points if the credit card has a billing statement address outside the US area. Very bad calculated.
1,I never got it,My computer shut down and i never got my code. I am intensely upset and I wish for my code please
1,Horrible.,I originally ordered a laser for the Xbox 360. Only to be sent a 1600 XBL points card. It took longer than expected to arrive and only when it did arrive did i see that it was not at all what i ordered. I tried to contact the supplier only to get no where and returns were not allowed. So I was stuck with an overprices XBL points card that I had no use for and wound up selling it to a friend for half of what i paid for it (sold to friend for $15. I paid $30 unknowingly) I do NOT suggest this supplier for anything. They pulled a bait and switch and I have stopped purchasing from Amazon since this poor purchasing experience.
4,"useful item, better than buying from xboxlive","When buying from xbox live, the point distribution is not convenient. Buying the cards is completely different. much better."
1,why buying microsoft points online blows,"I keep thinking buying Microsoft points through a third party will be easy, but it never is. I am pretty sure Bill Gates personally pays third parties like amazon to make buying points with them miserable. I challenge third parties to make buying cheaper points slightly easier than removing teeth without anesthesia. People might buy them and you might make a profit. Until then I will never try to do this through amazon again. i hate you microsoft and your stupid awesome video games that have ruined my life. the end."
1,I could walk to the store and back within 4 hours,I order a code online so i dont have to go to the store. It is ridiculous that I have to wait for a code when i ordered one five seconds before and i go it right away.
1,Xbox Microsoft Points from Amazon - NEVER AGAIN!!!,"The 12 Months Live Membership worked for me almost 4 days! That was not the product I paid for. Lots of emails, telephone calls, investigations and lost time and nerves until finally I got my money back. Then, I discovered the comfort and security of shopping in a real store. It's up to you, but I don't recommend to make that kind of purchase from here. There is no option to rate with less than one star but if there was, I would put zero!"
1,stupid,"It told me that it was taking longer than expected to process, and that it might take 4 hours to send me the code. Nuff said"
1,"digital order takes way to long, save time and go to walmart","whats the point of an ""online game code"" if it takes 4 hours for your order to process. I could have went to walmart, bought a 4000 microsoft points card and been home, downloaded the 3gig update and been playing by now for the same price. What a waste of time."
1,sucks,takes to long sometime going to store is so much faster .. work on your coustmer service this sucks.. need five moer words to post
4,BOII Season,I bought this for the Season Pass for Black Ops II. Thats the only way you can buy the season pass...is with MSP
5,"Perfect, fast, easy!","This should have been my first option but i went with gamestop and ordered it online, what a mistake that was. The online receipt said they would not charge me until the item has shipped but seeing as this was a online download code i don't see how that would be possible. Anyway, they charged me right away and i get an email saying they CANCELED MY ORDER! Take my money than cancel my order? bulls***. I called and could barley understand the customer service rep. but she did say my money would be reimbursed in 24 hours. AMAZON is the way to go. just a few clicks and credit card info, and they INSTANTLY give you the code."
1,sucks for me,"We are in the military and move often. I finally let my kids get the Xbox Live a couple of months ago, MISTAKE! Apparently our account is linked to the Country we started the account in and you can't change it (according to service rep) only option is to keep the original account and never be able to purchase US game codes, or get a new membership everytime we change countries and the kids lose the data. I now have a $47 US code and cannot use it, nor will I be able too unles we purchase another Live membership. I realize the fine print says your billing must be in the US to use the card, well my credit card billing is but my Xbox Live account is not because when we started it here in Canada the system would not let me put in a US address.I guess I am just out $47."
1,Very Very Dissapointed!!! Redeem Code ERROR,"Ok, after trying to redeem code for several days I still have an error message ""An error has occurred during the transaction. Please try again later."" And what do you think microsoft suggest??? They suggest to go on on trying !!!! It is funny and sad. Never again!"
1,takes forever,"its taking forever for them to mail me my digital code. 1st it timed out now for over 2days its ""pending"" better off going to buy it in the store"
1,Order never processed.,"Thought this would be a quick way to get my microsoft points without having to go to the store. Sadly, the order never finished processing so I never got the code. Also, I could not cancel the order. I will put an additional review up to mention how long it took to rectify the situation. On a further note, Amazon does not have a way to get in touch with them to solve this problem nor do they have a published email address. I was thinking of buying a kindle later on but now I am having second thoughts."
1,Microsoft can't get their act together,"The code that they sent me was invalid. Good luck getting Microsoft to correct the problem, as Amazon.com said that they didn't have the authority to verify the codes. You are better off going through the console's online browser marketplace."
1,Takes longer to receive than advertised,"This product is supposed to be viewable immediately after purchase (see text from Amazon below). I ordered this, and have yet to receive the code. I would recommend buying the card from a retailer if your intention is to use this immediately. Very disappointed.""You'll be able to view your online game code immediately after purchase. After placing your order, the code will be stored in Your Games Library. From your library, you can view or print the code, send the code to your e-mail address, or e-mail it as a gift."""
1,Silly Sale,"This is a silly offering. You can buy the points at the exact same price directly on your X-Box without having to sit and enter the code. It would be a much better deal if Amazon sold this for $39.99 like they used to sell the 4000 point cards for. Of course, with that said, the Amazon ""reviews"" are SUPPOSED to be for the item, not the price. Ok, so...YEA points! Great product!"
1,"Worked fine, but not a game","Apparently this is listed as a game. 1600 Xbox points are 1600 Xbox points. Worked just as expected. Good value. Paid extra for faster shipping, took longer than regular shipping usually takes. Couldn't post this until I rated it as a game. Since its not a game, I gave it the lowest game rating."
5,no complaints,Product/card was everything it was suppose to be. It gave me a key code immediately after purchase was made so we could use it right at that time.
5,Great way to get more Xbox Live Points!,"This is the only way my kids will get more Xbox Live Points from now on. The instant download is an excellent option. Order the points and immediately the code is given to you to add them to your account. Same price, but no tax as in the stores. Great idea."
3,"Buy the code, not the card","I have purchased MS points from Amazon many times, and I love the convenience of buying just the code without the card. This, however, was the first time I purchased the card and didn't get the free standard shipping. Eight dollars is way too much for S&H on something so small and simple. Mine arrived with the top portion badly bent, so just a few words of advice: buy the code, not the card."
5,Better than going to the store,It was like midnight when I bought this lol. I just didn't feel like heading to Walmart to go buy a damn card. It would've been easier to just buy over xbl but with all the hacks in ps3 I don't feel safe with my credit card info on any platform.
3,US customers only,"Well, I finally saw a game for the XBox Live Arcade that I really wanted, Virtual On Oratorio Tangram. So, I saw this deal on Amazon and thought it would be a good idea to buy points this way. For whatever reason (likely Microsoft's greed), if you're stationed overseas in the military or an expat this doesn't work. Maybe you can ask a friend in the US to buy it from here for you and then send you the code, but that's the only way not to pay tax for points. Kinda stupid, but that's the system."
1,No stars.. Ripped off,I bought this code and printed it out. When i went to go redeem it it didnt work on my xbox so i figured i guess ill try online i try online and its a invalid code. They ripped me off took my money and gave me a fake code.
3,4000 microsoft points yay.,Typical microsoft points- overpriced and monopolized.Wouldn't purchase other than to quiet screaming brat.What a waste of time and money.
4,Easy to input online,I wish you could just pay for things in the XBL Marketplace with a credit card like every other online service in the world. But that is still not the case. So purchasing the code online may be the best option within the corner that Microsoft has forced us into. You get the code immediately. Then you can easily enter the code at the Xbox web site. That is much easier than typing the code in the Xbox dashboard using a controller.
4,It worked great for me,"I ordered this code online and almost immediately got an email with the code. I typed it into my Xbox 360 and BLAMMO I had the 1600 credits.It seems unfair that you can't purchase with an amazon gift card, as other people claimed. I used my debit/credit card and had no problem."
3,Time may vary,"Ordered one 4000pts code, two different times (a month apart) a few months ago and both took only about 2-3 minutes to get the code. Ordered one yesterday and it took 8 HOURS."
3,"If you aren't in a rush, get a card shipped to you.","My experience is that the convenience of getting an online game code for Microsoft Points is counteracted by paying New York sales tax. Which is interesting because getting a Microsoft Points card carries no sales tax with it. If like me you are looking for a quick Rock Band fix, only have 700 Points and need 800 for the 4 songs you want, it is convenient not having to wait 2 days for the card to come in, or drive to a store and not get triple points on your Amazon Visa. But if you aren't impatient, wait and get a card in the mail.5 Stars for convenience0 Stars for tax"
5,Microsoft finally gets smart,"Not much to add from all the other positive reviews of this product, except that the card I just got does not have the silver ruboff anymore.All the 1600 point cards I have bought in the past (the most recent one being two weeks prior to getting this 4000 point card) has the serial code covered by those scratch-off silver layers, similar to those instant lottery tickets you can buy.The problem with the scratch-offs (other than being plainly annoying) is that if you're not careful, you can easily scratch off the serial number as well. So if you still have one with the scratch-off layer, do it gently.The 4000 point card I just got doesn't have the scratch-off. I don't know if they've all been like this (this is my first 4000 point card that I have bought) but kudos. Now Microsoft just needs to do this to all their cards. Oh... and get rid of the stupid plastic blister packaging. Not only are they super annoying to cut and open, but they're such an environmental waste."
1,Bent over a barrel,This is mostly an anti-microsoft live rant. I have both a PS3 and an Xbox360 - xbox charges for online content where the PS3 does not. I ended up purchasing these points so that I could play with family online.
4,It is what it is....,"It's 1600 MS points. Spends the same as if you purchased them through XBL or Zune Marketplace. Now at the time I ordered this the instant code was not available. So I strongly urge you people to just purchase the instant redeemable code. Unless this is a gift I can't see a reason not to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the shipping. Seriously Something the size of a credit card should not have to be packaged inside it's own blister pack and then again put into another box 4 times the size to be shipped out. It's just wasteful. That's really my only issue with Amazon's shipping. But now since I can just purchase the code, I can save the time and S&H costs."
5,Fast is the word,I received the code instantly on my email and use it asap and it works flawlessly. I really reccomend it.
5,Does what it says on the tin.,"I saved about 10% purchasing my 4000 microsoft points from Amazon rather than from Microsoft. I'm not sure what else Amazon would like me to say about this. It is a cardboard card with a code that is worth 4000 microsoft points. I got the card, opened the little window, entered the code I saw there into the correct screen on my xbox 360 and WHAM, I suddenly had 4000 points more than I'd had previously. So yeah, it worked."
5,simple,the quickest and most simple way i have ever purchased ms points for Xbox2mins later was choppin up some fruit ninja :)
2,Should have told me I would have to wait!,"Well I spent too much time doing this to be quite disappointed.I decided an online purchase would be quicker than the 5 minute drive to wal-mart.Then after I made my purchase they decided to tell me, Oh..well this may take up to 4 hours to process.BOO!"
2,Not Reliable,Half of the time the code appears on the screen in less then 2 minutes. Other times it can take up to an hour and then another hour to get the confirmation email. So dumb. Buy the card.
5,Perfect,"I love the digital download and instant access to the code, no waiting for shipping or anything just right to my pc then on to the xbox. Thanks again amazon."
5,MS POINTS,Extremely convenient and competitively priced. Will purchase all my points using this medium from now on!...thanks Amazon ;-)FromAndrew WJamaica.
5,Good,"The microsoft points code worked as soon as i put it in. It was a good buy, and i recommend it for xbox users!"
5,1600 points,I don't see why anyone would give this less than 5 stars. You know exactly what you're buying when you click confirm.You get a code to enter and add points into your account. It's just like the old fashioned card method except you don't actually get a card so it is instant. You can either manually pass the code to a friend as a gift or let Amazon send a nicely crafted email to them.
5,So much better than buying in store or on xbox live,Very much recommend this option for buying microsoft points because there is no tax and very quick and easy getting the code RIGHT AWAY!
4,It is what it is,If you're wanting to get MS points that's what this is. Makes a great gift for any gamer and the price is on par with everywhere else.
5,Fast and Easy!,Fast and easy way to buy Microsoft points.Received the code instantly when I checked out. Couldn't have been easier.This is how I will be buying MS Points from now on.
5,Great,"I was on the Xbox live market and wanted to buy something but didn't have the required points. I didn't feel like going to the store to pick up a card. I went on Amazon and just got the code. So much easier and more convenient. I got the points instantly, didn't even have to leave my house."
5,great seller. immediate results.,"i bought these points thinking i'd get a card in the mail like the ones you buy in the store. but i logged into my email a few minutes later to do my daily checking, and i saw an email from this seller with all the code in the email. i was like ""wow"" because i couldnt believe how fast i got the codes. i entered them. there were alot since they can only 160 each. but when all was said and done, as advertised, i had 4,000 points. smooth transaction. got the points immediately. i highly recommend this seller."
5,Fast Points,I purchased these point and received the code immediately. It was cheaper then going to the store and I didn't have to pay tax. This is the way to go if you want instant points.
5,Great,400 Microsoft points. I am going to buy some DLC for dance central 3! I will have fun with this!
5,Instant Access to Your Points,"Unlike some other sites, I had instant access to the code. It's nice not to have to wait one or more hours for an ""instant"" email."
5,Quick and Easy,"Point 1, cheaper than getting the card from a brick and mortar store or Microsoft.Point 2, easy to activate. Don't even have to type in the code if you copy and paste it on xBox Live.Point 3, get it instantly so you don't have to wait.Do I need to say more?"
5,The best way to buy ms points!,"I was looking around the web for cheap microsoft points, and came across several offers that look like stolen Xbox Live accounts with points added to them. So I refuse to tie any credit card numbers to my Xbox live account. Thanks to Amazon's instant download option, I don't have to. I just get the code to type into my Xbox. It's like buying a card without having to leave home, or wait for the mail."
1,I received an incorrect game code microsoft did not accept the game code,I have paid $49.99 online to get 4000 xbox game points. But the code was incorrect. So do not trust to buy online codes.
1,Tried adding points to account and everything looked like it worked but points never added to my account.,Tried adding points to account and everything looked like it worked but points never added to my account. I don't need the points bad enough to buy another one.
1,If some of the digits are unreadable you are out of luck,Received one of these cards for my son from another retailer. This neither retailer's or Amazon's problem. The problem is with Microsoft. 3 of the last 5 digits on our card were unreadable. All the rest of the digits are clear as a day and were scratched off with the same amount of force. Microsoft basically told us we are out of luck. Thanks Microsoft. Playstation 4 for me next go around.
2,PS3 GIVES FREE INTERNET,"Xbox live has constantly badgered all thier customers/clients with more charges/billing/downloads etc to all thier loyal customers & weve been loyal since the 1st Halo. Now Halo4 Lags,internet play sucks at high speed with boost! Legendary on spartan ops is weak. Maps are ripoffs of H2-3.weapons all suck except beam rifle. weapon tech should increase & get better as games go. Not worse!"
2,Took about an hour to receive..,"I didn't want to put my CC information into Live, so I figured I'd use Amazon instead. Unfortunately, I had to put my CC information in again (for 1-Click Purchasing) anyway, so that was a bit annoying.Put in my information, purchased, and... nothing. It told me that the processing would take up to four hours. An hour later I finally got the code. If I need Live points again (not likely, since I don't have an Xbox) I likely won't buy them through Amazon."
1,I got ripped off!!,I bought this card to put points on my xbox live account. But the redemption code they gave me didn't work. The customer service people with xbox live are not helping either. Buyer beware of this!!
1,used,"ordered this for a gift for my grandson and when it came in, the back had been removed and the code was scratched off... so I lost 49.99 because my friends said that it would not be replaced..because i had no way to show that it came in that way..All I know is that I'm 55 yrs old and do not play xbox..... So anyone that orders this type of item please check it as soon as you get it and good luck getting it replaced or refunded... so I will not be ordering any more items of this nature from amazon..."
3,Necessary but expensive,Necessary but expensive.Arrived in time and worked without problem.But again... expensive! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
4,Pretty good service,The only thing is that I would like to use it for downloading any content from my region if since I am paying for it.
1,4 hour wait time...,"I am a part of a family pack and so my account is unable to purchase microsoft points, i bought this with the expectation that i would be able to go and get my dlc as soon as order. now i have a 4 hour wait time. That is garbage, they should notify the customer before that it would work that way. I would have rather given my money to walmart. This is very disappointing."
1,swindle !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,my code is wrong !!! i paid for nothing !!!!i can't believe this ! i tried and i tried but it's ussless !!!
5,Good Product,"Instant code access, competitive price!Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some fast points!This helped me round out my FUT."
1,Can't use Amazon gift card?,"I hate when a product is reviewed because of the website's faults, but the whole point of this product is so that a person does not have to use a credit card to obtain Microsoft Points. When ordering, I encountered a screen that required me to give credit card information, even though I had sufficient funds on my Amazon account.Now I can't play the new Fallout 3 DLC!!!"
3,hsrfhxrfhfrh,la cacca puzza perché la pipi è gialla o verde a seconda di quello che hai bevuto cacca ca cacacac acac
1,Already Used! Scam,I bought this code and I got it and tried t enter and it and it did not work! Do Not Buy! waste of 20 dollars
1,Code doesnt work,I dont understand why it isnt working and i cant find any place to get incontact to fix this.
5,Excellent,Bought this just for Dawnguard its perfect if you dont want to go to the store did not take long to recieve it.
5,Awesome alternative to buying in store,"Bought the code, received my email and redeemed my points. Way more convenient than buying in store and I don't have to provide Microsoft with my credit card info. Win!"
2,Tricky,"First, I would like to thank the reviewer who stated his work-around for an invalid code. I also received this error when inputting my code directly into the console. The trick is to redeem this code on your PC via your XBOX live account on xbox.com. It shouldn't be this hard, perhaps the code needed more time to become valid on the console-side, but without this helpful review I would have been stuck waiting.The code does take a long time to generate on Amazon. I have a very fast broadband connection and was surprised it took a few minutes to do it's thing. I can see how someone with a slower connection might have given up assuming an error had occurred.I think I will be purchasing a physical card from Amazon or utilizing the xbox.com marketplace from this point forward."
5,xbox 360 cards,for xbox 360 cards very safe i buy again tks AAA+ is same for xbox way for PlayStation Network card buy again !!! fast no tax
5,Much Needed Denomination for Xbox Live Currency,This is a great denomination to release Microsoft points in. Since most games on Xbox Live Arcade are purchased in 400 point ($5) increments this card give you the ability to download ten 400 point games or five 800 point games or some other combination (you get the idea). $50 is also a much more acceptable amount than the $62.50 for 5000 points. Since this is on a card it makes this possible to give as a gift or buy without using a credit card. This would be a worthwhile purchase for anyone with an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live.
1,Microsoft points,I bought this for my son and he entered it and it did not work right. He only was able to use 320 of the points and the rest disappeared. I would not purchase them again on amazon. I was extremely disappointed.
1,status code: 8016A04B,"I bougth this Xbox LIVE 1600 Microsoft Points [Online Game Code] on june, but we got this status code and we never can use the points. How we can do?"
1,quite disappointed,"the code that I bought online and sent to my email did not work, I try several times and nothing happened, I am very disappointed because I thought it was great to buy the code and enter it immediately for Microsoft Points, but I realized that a service is unreliable and I doubt that I will use it again"
2,M$ points,"Someday Microsoft will give up on their use of their own limited currency for what were ""microtransactions"", and just replace them with a standard credit card purchase. Until then, we have M$ points, which can be purchased at 80ms to the dollar. I like buying them from Amazon instead of directly from MS because then I get to use my Amazon card for cash back on each purchase. If only I could find a currency market and mechanism by which to exchange my M$ points for real money..."
5,excellent,"I chose that ranquin for being reliable, I have opportunities taste for downloading directly from the page without having to wait for the shipping of the physical card, I recommend it so easy and safe transsaccion"
5,Better than the Rest,I went to other sites to buy points in a rush and ended up waiting over a day. Luckily I remembered I can get the codes here as soon as I pay for it. Great deal when your dealing with Amazon.
1,Double your cost or nothing!,"For a $20 dollar item, $43 + 7 shipping is allot to pay. Look elsewhere on amazon..Xbox 360 Live 1600 Points"
5,Fast Easy Xbox Points,The only way to get Xbox points with ever having to leave your living room. I will no longer buy points directly from Microsoft.
5,Convenient and Fast! (Digital Code),I oredered the online game code and found it to be very convenient. I strongly dislike putting my card information on the Xbox because of there auto-renewal features they automatically sign you up for and because of the playstation network credit card debacle. This is easy and you get the code instantly. It also works great for giving a gift. I hope amazon keeps doing this as I will continue to use this feature down the road.
5,Essential for Xbox Marketplace purchases.,"There's not much to say -- this card gives you 1600 (or $20 worth) Microsoft Points, which you can spend on music, movies, shows, games & game expansion packs, etc.These cards are a safe way to get points -- there's always a risk involved when you use your credit card online, and using it over Xbox Live is no exception. Buying one of these cards ensures you don't run into that sort of trouble, and it can also be given as a gift or exchanged or re-sold, if you want.Most decent 'arcade' or 'indie' games on Xbox Marketplace cost between 800-1200 points, so this card should get you 1-2 cool games to play when you're tired of your mainstream games on discs.When you buy from Amazon, you end up saving like fifty cents or something... so, really, it's a pretty decent deal."
5,Best option,"This is by far, the best way to purchase microsoft points. Tax free, fast, no credit card on file with microsoft."
5,Can't ask for a better way to get points,"I bought the 1600 just to make sure it worked. It was great. I made the quick purchase, and in about 45 seconds I had a code on my screen to enter into Xbox Live. Redeem Code, entered it in, 1600 points were right in my account. $0.25 (plus tax?) saved.Next time I'm definitely going with the 4000 points for the larger savings amount. Great experience!EDIT: Uh oh... they upped the price back to retail. Bummer. You still may be tax exempt depending on where you live and you can forgo going through Microsoft's system to purchase points, but now it's less lucrative.EDIT #2: And they're back to $19.75 again. I'd say wait for the favorable price, then buy away :)"
5,Best point ever spent!,Micro points are good use for awesome dlc on Xbox 360 market place just as you know I been a long time subscriber.
5,Fast and no hassle!,The item was exactly what I wanted at a good price. I was able to get my code emailed immediately to me and didn't have to pay for shipping or wait for the product. Great way to do buisness!
4,what it is,Good for what it costs and microsoft points can buy games on demand and xbox live gold. I wish 400 points was worth more though.
5,A++++,this is the best way to get the microsoft points. sometimes they're a a discount and that's always nice. great!
3,Points are Points,Not much to say about t his. Just look for a good price and buy it. Can't really go wrong.
1,Super Long! I hate this!,"When I first bought this, I expected this to be simple and fast because I wanted to just be an Easy Microsoft Points Card via Online but it wasn't anything like that. Instead, it took forever! I hate this, and it said it would take up to 4 hours to get the code! What a ripoff!"
1,One star for you.,"This product could have been better if it not for the fact that you cannot get said product (at least with digital distribution) outside of the US. So'till that happened this product gets one star.Great idea, But mediocre in execution."
1,I can't redeem this points,"I can't redeem this point, error or code 8016A04B why can i do? My account is region USA and windows live id too."
4,Be careful to choose carefully between CARD or ONLINE,"I ordered for the first time and read all the reviews noting the fast or instant delivering which is what I wanted and needed. But what I failed to do was to realize that the default is for the ""CARD"" not a ""CODE"". I assumed all was good when at check out there was no delivery charge since I expected an email with a usable code. No code came and I had to go through the customer service maze to find my error. I had to reorder making sure to click the CODE option and sure enough I received the code at the end of the process. But I still now have to return the card that was not wanted but that is due to be delivered next week. The CODE works great but I would like to see a bigger note or highlight about the TWO options that has the default setting as card to be mailed for other novices like myself."
3,Mostly great,"Its great to have these points instantaneously but it really sucks that you have to pay tax, at least I did for 2400 Microsoft Points.I find it rather funny that you have to pay tax to convert your money into something that can only be used for certain items."
5,Nice,"I just bought this for my Rockband game , and it really is that good. Because i prefer buying a card instead of giving Microsoft my Credit Card numbers , because the charged me 0.50 Dollars without my permission. So choose wisely"
1,Didn't work on xbox live,"The code didn't work at all, always was rejected by xbox live.The code didn't work at all, always was rejected by xbox live."
1,Code didn't work :(,The code did not work. Not satisfied. Just one of those random hiccups I guess just sucks I lost $20 on it.
1,Kinda disappointed,The only money I hhave on Amazon.com is on a gift card.. and I wanted to buy the online code so that I can use it right away but it says I need a credit card and I don't have one. You can't use a gift card to buy the code???? What's that about?!
1,Occasional theft,"The first XBox live card was stolen by the warehouse staff, the second one arrived as a replacement. Amazon said they'd give me a refund. The rep lied. I'm out the money."
1,SUCK,They won't send a /code/ to an email address because I live in Puerto Rico. That's beyond stupid and has lost them a sale.
1,Why buy these codes?,You can purchase these points directly from your console at $01.25 per point. It appears to be the same price at the store as on your console.1000 = $12.501600 = $20.004000 = $50.005000 = $62.50
1,HORRIBLE/DEFECTIVE SERVICE,"this service i thought would be great esspecially cause everything with codes seems pretty instant when it comes to getting the code, not with this service, i've never reviewed anything but i felt ripped off considering i just could of got the points on xbox live, this is a service i would AVOID"
3,Wasn't any cheaper.,Buying this here wasn't any cheaper than buying directly thru the x-box. Only did it this way because My router doesn't virus protect the x-box and wanted to avoid identity theft. From the reviews I read you have a 50/50 chance of getting ripped off either way. Buy it in a store if it's a reasonable price.
1,Try the 4000 points,Negative stars if possible for questionable advertising practices. I've gone so far as to say bait & switch in other discussions. Limited quantity never stated anywhere until your half way through check out. Single card plus S&H cost more than buying directly from XBL or at a local store giving me instant gratification instead of 4 to 7 business days which from the sounds of some is more like 14 to 30. If I'm wanting to buy and I see alternate offer of 4000 point card which is cheaper than XBL and has free shipping makes waiting the 4 to 30 days somewhat worth it right? Bait & switch I see.
4,MS points good....,"Hello, I am satisfied by service. Could you consider to ship thsi product overseas? For ex. I am living in Turkey. It would be nice if you send it via airmail this product also. Or can you sell only redeem code as software. This is the only valuable item on product...Thank you"
5,"No tax, cheaper than on live","What else is there to say? Immediate delivery in my email, no tax, and cheaper than if you go through xbox itself. I will never buy points on console or in stores again."
5,Quick'n easy !!!,This is better and fast than goint to the store and buy one card. Yus buy and wait for the code.
5,No Time For The Store? No Problem!,"Buying Xbox Live Microsoft Points couldn't be easier than simply clicking your way through it! Amazon made it so easy for me to simply buy, click, and retrieve the code! It surely saved me from wasting gasoline to drive down to my local retailer to get one of these. I could also simply buy this through my Xbox 360 console... which brings me to my next point. Being that this is giving me a code, this is really handy when buying 1600 Microsoft Points to friends who live far from my location! It reduces time wasted from sending it through the post and it surely beats taking a long road trip!Amazon is the one retailer that makes buying Microsoft Points convenient (and convenient for gifting!)"
3,ok,it is okay it did take the full 4 hours to get a code but its better than gamestop because gamestop takes days but other than that its good
5,I like,Its nice to buy points from amazon and get them instantly. Never had a problem. Thanks for the good service.
5,Xbox 360 - 1600 Microsoft Points (x3),"Easy to order, quickly shipped, and much cheaper (at the time of order) than if I had placed an order for the single 4000 point card. As it was, I received 4800 points (1600 x3) for about the same price as a 4000 point card."
2,Why is it such a long wait.,4 hours for a code? That seems to be a bit excessive. Very dissapointed with four hours man if only i could download my game but i am waiting sour right now sour.
5,easy,Easy as cake got code in email within a few minutes and boom it worked all points in my account
5,A good choice to have,Is very good to have as a choice to buy Microsoft Points.If you are part of the Xbox live family yearly gold past then your option for buying points for your account and be redemed then this is your choice here unless you are the head account of the Xbox live family yearly past and can buy microsoft points and pass them on (minimum of 400 points) to other accounts.Very goog option to have. when you buy it you will recieve a code imidiately and the you redem the code on the Xbox 360 and thats all you have to do enjoy the points ah and by buying the points here on Amazon you save the taxes that Xbox 360 Will charge you for buying points from them directly.
5,Great!,This is a great alternative to buying prepaid cards in stores. You can get them whenever you want too! Great product!
5,Better and cheaper than from Microsoft,"I trust amazon a lot more than I trust Microsoft, so of course I am not going to give them my credit card information. The price is also a tad bit cheaper here too!"
4,Works as advertised,How do you review points? They're just points. If you can get it for 100 points per dollar it's a good deal. Also a good idea to buy this over giving Microsoft your CC#.
5,MS Points,1600 points with insta codeworks well if you don't to put ur CC info on the XBOX.Totally legit.I bought Fallout Expansions and Super Meat Boy :)
4,Pretty quick,"I ordered my code and dialed it into my xbox. It didn't immediately work, but after about a ten minute wait, it went through just fine. Xbox didn't want to take my credit card for some reason, but Amazon still will. ^_^"
4,I got my points...,Took a few hours... but it was easier than going out and driving. I played xbox for a little while and ate then realized I got an email to get my code. Could be faster since its digital...
3,Beats Having to Drive to Target,It's my nine year old's money that he either earned or received via a gift card. Hard to watch him spend it on worthless garbage like this but can't argue with the convenience.
5,quickest way to get points,"I am currently on a family plan and therefore do not have access to buying points directly from Microsoft as only the administrator has that option. the digital codes from Amazon are a good alternative, and is much faster than driving to the store. Not to mention that if you would rather not give your credit information to Microsoft, this is a safe option."
2,trouble adding to my account,The points where there but i had trouble adding them on my account and needed xbox support to help me out
5,Perfect,It's quick and easy. Gotta make it quick going back to back to karkand BF3 ASAP GT: CesarinNc BF3 FIFA 13 and BO2
3,Works as intended.,"I'm not quite sure whether this was a good deal or not, I bought it a long while ago but I'm sure the order was fine. 3/5 because of money-grubbing DLC content."
5,what I have expected before,"I always wanted microsoft points, just didn't want to use my card on xbox's website so I bought it here. Easy transaction, and fast way to get the code."
5,Points for any reason,"By getting this code online, it saves you a lot of time. You can use these points for any reason and if you're a gamer, you know you need points in order to unlock some special features in most games."
5,Good,"Points worked as expected & were received in time, no issues, good deal, it's OK if you want to take the risk!"
5,Great it Works,Great Allow me to buy rayman 3 hd and now woul get 400 points more to get i'm alive for 1200... xbox rules
4,1 happy gamer son,"I bought this for my gamer son and I'm very happy with my purchase. It was cheaper than I can buy it local, plus not having to go to the store and get the card was helpful."
4,great product.,worked great. grand son loved it. thinking I might buy him the one with the key pad on it .
2,XBOX LIVE 400 points,"It is OK because helps you with something in a hurry, but it is just a few for downloading & obtaining big features."
2,decent,The first time I ordered this product it worked fine. But this time I have to wait for the order to process. It says it can take up to 4 hours. I am very impatient and next time I think I'll just go to Walmart or Gamestop. So bored I need those points for an arcade game. Oh well guess I will have to wait.
5,never trying to buy from xbox again. Amazon FTW,"After trying all day long to buy xbox points on xbox website and also on my console. On the phone twice each with my credit card company, paypal, and microsoft xbox. All of them pointing fingers to the other why Microsoft would not accept my credit card or paypal (which is good from what paypal and my credit card company stated). Didn't know it was so hard to give a corporation my money these days. Finally learned about and bought the DL code from Amazon, instantly use it to redeem on xbox's website, and instantly have 1600 points. So easy a caveman can do it! Microsoft you suck!"
5,Great Service!,"This is a great service provided by Amazon! Quick and easy, and the code is provided within seconds! =D"
2,"Works, but very slow","The redemption process for this is supposed to be fast, but Amazon takes 20 minutes or half an hour to process orders. It's frustrating to do this here, especially when the instantly available Microsoft ordering system costs the same. Don't waste your time with Amazon's poorly implemented redemption system."
5,TITLE: Xbox 360 LIVE 1600 Points,"Well, if you use the xbox360, what's not to like? You can buy ad-ons to your games and if you like, buy outfits for your Avatar to go with the games you play or to match with the holidays, like a flag vest for the 4th of July or snowballs to throw in the winter or one of my favorites, popcorn for my Avatar to eat while I'm watching a movie :)"
3,Point system is worthless,"I do not understand why Microsoft uses the ""point system"" instead of just telling the price outright. I mean, what's the point (pun intended), when if you know the price you are more likely to buy it."
4,Great deal,"While nobody really likes Microsoft points and being forced to buy a set amount instead of the exact they need for a purchase, when the cards do go on sale, you effectively get more for less (in other words, you're not waiting for the game/content to go on sale itself but if the points you buy are cheaper then you get that content cheaper whether its on sale or not). I bought 3 cards @ [...] each ([...] savings on each card) and it's money well spent and saved for me."
1,Sucks!!!!,Have to WAIT. Up to 4 hours before u can download. NOWHERE does it say that. Will not buy here again
1,Horrible.,"Decided to save 10 minutes and order an online code for 1200 Microsoft Points instead of driving to best buy. The code they sent me is invalid. Amazon said I have to deal with Microsoft, Microsoft says they ""may"" be able to fix the problem, and they'll call me in 3 days.3 days? Really? Because Amazon can't seem to do their jobs right? That's great.I order at LEAST 3 things off Amazon every week, and now I will never make a purchase from them again. This is absolutely ridiculous ."
5,XBOX Points,Not much to say about this. Its real money converted into virtual money so that you can buy virtual wares on xbox
5,~*~*~*~Five Twinkling Stars To You*~*~*~*,WOW - such a great gift to give to my son! He loves to use these and it is so easy!!!
5,Very Convenient,"They're MS points..I gave this 5 stars because I love that I don't have to go to the store to buy the points. I didn't want to register a credit card with MS, so having to go buy a card and then read those tiny little numbers from the scratch off was my own personal annoyance, since my husband loves the arcarde games. Now I get a code instantly on the computer."
1,NEVER BUY PRELOADED ACCOUNTS,"I have experienced this and worked with police in LA... and you'll see a number of reviews here about ""invalid codes."" When you buy a code without the card it is nearly ALWAYS obtained from a stolen credit card. You can get your LIVE account banned or, more likely, it won't work and you'll be out the money.Seriously. Avoid points without a card. I do not work for Microsoft, I am just a consumer who has been burned by these con men and I would like to help people out and not support criminals who steal credit card info."
1,A risky way to buy points,"I bought points through Amazon.com before and it was a very convenient experience. Recently I have decided to buy more points using the same service and it is taking a ridiculous amount of time to receive my code.I've already tried to speak to customer service about my problem, but, not to sound mean, they are incomprehensible due to their broken, heavily accented English. After fifteen seconds of attempting to transcend this insurmountable language barrier, I just hung up my phone out of frustration.Buy the points in physical format or directly from MS, but I would not trust this service again."
1,Up to 24 hours for delivery,"After a half hour I did not have my code, I called customer service. They transferred me to advanced support. The guy said it could take up to 24 hours to receive the code."
1,"Very very very slow ""instant"" digital delivery !","I thought since this was ""Online Game Code"" 5$ expensier than a hardcopy and classified as ""online"" it will be a matter of minutes untill you reicive your code ! But guess what, that doesnt work that way at all (to me, an I can see a lot of others in here too complaining) ! It can take hours (me), (or even a day or two for some) for you to get your code !!???It is gonna cost you less time to go to some of malls to buy this code (and less money) than wait to get confirmation on your mail!You never know when you gonna get it, well thats called a lottery ! And that is a fact !"
1,ONLY US!!!!?????WHY??????,"I can certainly tell this is a great way of purchasing MS points, its easy, its almost instant, and 24 hour open, but I found a flaw....at least for me... its US only, that's frustrating for a lot of people like me that don't live in US that will have to wait for order process, delivery to an international courier, travel process from US state to non US country and then having to pick it up. Just to get a small card and put in a code......really .....I can't see the reason why this is a US only, I buy almost weekly from Amazon, never had a problem, so why?"
1,"""Currently being processed""","When I saw another review saying that their points were ""Currently being processed"" I figured it was probably just his bad luck. But it has also happened to me. And If I would have known it was going to take this long, I would MUCH have rather just went to Walmart or something and bought it there.- I will no longer be making Xbox Live Content purchases from Amazon.com, I am going to stick to the old fashioned way.I think selling game codes for point/games instantly is a great idea, too bad that's not what you'll get when you order.EDIT: Received my code a few minutes short of 24 hours after I made my purchase."
4,360,We don't like software cause it has made us loose time with our grandson but it but it sure does keep one occupied. That it does do.
4,OK,"Purchased this online for my son to keep from having to drive to town and get him points. Once I purchased it, there was some kind of error and it could not give me the code to add the points. It said it would take about 4 hours, probably less. I checked my emails regularly, and finally about midnight, the email came in with the codes. I ordered it at noon."
4,XBox Points,"Purchase was easy to complete and loading the points is a snap.Personally, I think it's a lot of money to spend on ""air"", but my teenager is happy and he really likes getting these points for his games. From my side, it's great to come home from work to find out he's accomplished a really big job that I would have had to spend 1/2 a weekend doing and being able to say ""Thanks"" right away--without having to get back in my car to go buy a card with points on it. Because these points have a code that is immediately available he can get right to the gaming as soon as the points are purchased and I don't have to chase around trying to find a) an open store that b) sells the cards and c) has them in stock with d) the right number of points.If you're going to purchase points this is the way to go."
4,It took a while,"I ordered it on a weekend and the code came after 1 to 2 hours into my account, but longer than the suggested time. Still it was worth the wait."
5,House of Cards,"Not sure why anyone would give this item less than 5 stars. It's a freakin points card! It's exchanging one form of currency for another form of currency, usually at a discounted rate (unless you get the instant code). Sure, you can say you hate the points system or you hate the game you bought with the points or you hate shipping fees but that has nothing to do with the actual card. It does what you expect it to do and it does it well. I actually think it's kind of cute too, especially when it's fresh out of the shipping box. Once again, it's just a card that happens to have a little strip on the back that you rip off to reveal an alphanumeric code that you enter into Xbox Live to download all sorts of wonderful goodies. Get one. Get two. Get them now!"
4,"Fast, Easy & Quick",This is a really convenient way to buy points. It's quick and painless through Amazon. Once everything is verified you can redeem the code right away. The only hiccup with this through Amazon is you have to manually put in your payment information when you buy a code. Even if you're already a member you still have to do it. It's kind of inconvenient to do this when you already have an account with the payment information already saved. Other than that it's really easy and it saves you a trip to the store and not to mention it saves you sales tax. Can't beat it.
3,not bad...but not great,an interesting read because it gives you insight into a rarely discussed problem. the interviews are good but the rest of the text is geared toward academic study of the problem.
2,Quality not what I expected,I was not pleased with the quality for the price. Shirt just felt cheap! I ended up returning it!
1,"Shocking, Parents beware!","Babar was a book, my children loved. My granddaughter was excited about watching The Babar series. In episode one, Babar was a baby elephant with his mom and other elephants. A hunter comes and shoots his mama, Babar falls off his mothers back, then what look likes blood is all over and he is crying for his mama. My GRANDDAUGHTER was horrified!!! Parents beware, it is very upsetting to a three-year-old.Babar's First Step"
2,A huge confusing mess,"I gave it 2 stars because certain scenes were beautifully written. But. There was so much going on, I got confused and was in a hurry for it to end."
2,I thought this was the answer to my needs.,"The biggest problem was needing to change 3 CR 2032 batteries every 2 or 3 weeks. Within 2 months I already spent more than I paid for the organizer in batteries. I threw it out. Other than that: I checked out all the organizers available when my old one went. Until finding this, not one did everything I wanted. I use Outlook Express, but because I thought this was the answer to my needs, I imported everything from OE to Outlook on another login identity on my computer along with my ""Works"" calendar. Everything uploaded without any problem to the device. Software that came with it worked well. I liked the idea of the extra programs - currency converter, language translators, translators for common phrases, and spell checker. Well, only ONE extra program is downloadable at a time. So, going to Quebec I had to decide on currency converter, English to French translator or French phrases."
4,Useful Aid,I currently work as executive assistant to the director of a large and complex medical division. The Rolodex personal PDA comes in very handy in controlling the many different issues that I need to deal with daily. It definitely makes my life easier.
2,Item Regular.- Not so good.,"I can`t transfer datas between the Rolodex device and my personal PC (Windows XP Prof. I have installed the Desktop Manager sofware CD in my personal PC, and I can not to use both.However, The Rolodex Organizer doesn`t have several functions that I need: Directory Phone, Schedule, etc. Bad luck.March 08, 2007"
4,Wiggly Wiggly DVD,I really enjoyed this DVD. There were several guest singers which made a nice variety. My son really loves the Wiggles and especially enjoys this movie.
4,Not as Wiggly as some but still Wiggly Fun!,"My daughters (1 and 2.5 years old) are Wiggles addicts - we have Wiggles videos, cds, toys, books etc. They love all the Wiggles videos they have but probably this one is played the least. I think because the songs are a bit more mellow than some of the other ones when they can jump and dance around. I find this is a good video to calm them down before bed, where something like ""Hoop De Doo, It's a Wiggly Party"" - is full of fast paced songs which are perfect for a energetic dance around the lounge room or to play at a birthday party.The video is great and features some well known Australia and New Zealand singers with songs that made them famous. It's an interesting collabaration with the Wiggles twist given to songs that have been around since I was a child.The Wiggles really enjoy what they do - I highly recommend any of their videos, cds and if you get the change to see them live - you won't be sorry!"
4,"Fun, Colorful, and Entertaining!","This is the first Wiggles video I've bought for our one year old daughter. I love the majority of the songs and she loves to dance to most of them. She usually won't watch anything but Baby Einstein, so it says quite a bit if she enjoys the video. I like the songs, but I don't feel they are as good as their earlier songs (e.g. Yummy Yummy). Overall, it's a great video."
2,Not as good as the rest!!,"...My sons and I were dissapointed - this video is not as lively or engaging. I recommend the 3-pack of Wiggle Time, Toot Toot and Yummy Yummy - much better!"
4,My son loves it!,I got this dvd from the library and my son was devastated when we had to return it. It saves my sanity on rainy days and he loves the music and dancing along with the characters!
2,"Slow, slow, slow","Other reviewers have said this is the best Wiggles video! It's the only one we own, so I can't compare; but, if this is the best, then I'm certainly not buying any more.The TV show is upbeat and fun. This video is not. The songs on the video get progressively slower and duller. Is the object to put children to sleep?After the first three songs, each number just drags and is far from being a catchy tune. My 14 month old loves the TV show, but this gets old with him very quickly."
1,Don't Waste The Money,"I have a 2 year old that loves the Wiggles, but this video does nothing for her. She is bored to death with the drab, lifeless songs. Almost every song is sung by a ""special guest"" and they're all Australian singers singing Australian folk songs. This video doesn't have the usual upbeat songs and dances that my daughter originally fell in love with on their 'Toot Toot' video."
2,Start somewhere else...,"After my 18 month-old son saw the Wiggles on Playhouse Disney, he was hooked. This was the first videotape we purchased of the Wiggles (my son picked it out himself...it was obviously the most colorful). None of the songs featured on this tape are ever sang on the show and feature several Australian artists that are unknown in America. We then bought ""Toot Toot"" and ""Yummy Yummy"" and both those tapes worked much better with my son. These tapes feature more of the songs from the Disney show and the tapes are more in that vein...silly and fun, whereas ""Wiggly Wiggly World"" lumbers along at a snail's pace. I'd give ""Toot Toot"" and ""Yummy Yummy"" five stars and make ""Wiggly Wiggly World"" the last Wiggles tape in your collection."
2,Disappointing,"My children LOVE previous Wiggles videos, because the songs were so simple that toddlers and preschoolers could sing and dance along. But this overly slick video does not inpsire participation, at all. The dances are way too complicated, the flashy graphics distracting, and the additional characters irritating (especially the choreographer who now features herself prominantly as a character). The 4 Wiggles have previously shown themselves to be brilliant in their simplicity. I wish they would get back to their original style."
5,Wiggling in this World,"As expected, The Wiggles have struck chords with our children in this, one of their most high tech, releases and in our opinion one of their best ! This release entertains us with several special guest singers of multi-cultural backgrounds and of course the main attraction - THE WIGGLES! From Japanese to Aboriginal to New Wave to traditional to the great Wiggles Originals, ""It's a Wiggly, Wiggly World"" is sure to please any child who loves to dance and sing. One of our favs has to be ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport"" performed by Rolff Harris and his ""Wobble Board"" with Anthony, Jeff, Greg and Murray acting out the animals and jumping like kangaroos! (You must see Greg in his cockatoo headress and dark sunglasses in this one!) Well worth a buy! GO FOR IT! GOOD ON YA MATE!"
5,Sam Fishers' pandora tomorrow,"S.C. Pan. Tom. finally came to the PS2! Worth the wait when you consider the exclusive extras not found in the xbox & pc versions... including alternate pathways in some stages, ability to disable booby traps, post mission stats scoring screen, an all-new jungle mission, and listening to in-mission situation reports(via the USB headset, not included). I was able to buy the game on sale for just 11$ new from a local retailer. Don't worry, the beautiful graphics hold their own vs. the xbox version. Highly rated/Highly recommended. A must have for PS2 stealth-action fans. 1-4 players, rated teen for blood/violence/drug references, an ""online"" ready game. Nice job ubisoft and thanks for the extras!"
4,BEST GRAPHICS EVER!,"Very good graphics. I'm not that far yet but it is so much fun! I personally enjoy taking the guards out from behind them. So far it's been pretty easy but I bet later in the game it will get very tactical. Right now i'm at the first part in Paris where the guards hit the alarm the split second they see me. But i'm figuring out how to beat it. If you get this game, you've gotta be real smart at tactical games. But, I'm only ten and I plan on beating all 32 levels in atleast one yaer."
3,It's Ok I guess,"I Liked the first one but I don't know,This one just wasn't as fun as the first.It seemed liked you didn't have all your moves and Gadgets.Don't listen to me I just thought the first was better."
5,Get Tomorrow Today,I'll keep it short and sweet; this game is simply one of the best games I've ever played and that's saying a lot for a stealth game. I liked it better than the first one.5 stars!!!
4,"Pandora Tomorrow, The unloved middle child","All we hear about, when it comes to Splinter cell is how innovating the first and third one was. Or, the mercenary v. spy multiplayer. It's sad by how much people ignore the second game. I found it a great game in it's own right. I'm not badmouthing the other two. I'm a splinter cell fanatic, I own all three games. They're awesome games. But Pandora Tomorrow turned me on to the series it should least get a little more credit by putting the game series on the market"
3,Back for More,"This is my second go round with Mr. Fisher, and though I had a better time with him this adventure, I still can't say that the time we shared was great--good, yes, but not great. I guess I'm just not a stealth-game guy; I like shooting stuff, killing stuff, and doing both while making as much noise as possible. Ultimately, though, I think it comes down to this: there are games you can't wait to play again even while you're playing them; games you enjoy playing while you're playing them, but have no interest in playing again; and games that are so awful that you've no interest in playing them to the end. For me, both the first two Splinters are the second type of game. But I guess I'm a glutton for punishment, because Chaos Theory here I come!"
3,"Well, not as good as the first one + Lambert and Sam talk diffrent","Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow was OK but Splinter Cell, Rainbow six, Halo, & now GHost Reacon were all rally good! So Pandora Tomorrow was not that fun!!"
2,Moldy Book,The book was wet at one time and someone tried to dry it out too late. There was mold on the bottom of the book and the book has a strong odor of mold. This book should not have been sold.
2,"Slow beginning, great court scene in the end","Although I did enjoy parts of this book, especially the court drama at the very end, some parts of the book were disappointing. The fact that all of the black male characters in this book were either in a gang and not even one was portrayed in a good light made this book hard for me to read. Even the main character, Tracy Shephard, did not really have a fully developed character. I didn't develop a closeness with the main character, and this left me with no particular feeling about any of the characters in the novel."
3,Kate Hannigan's Girl,"As I have been a great fan of Catherine Cookson's for many years, I was not really impressed with this book. Although I did enjoy it, I have liked her other stories much better."
5,Wow! Great upgrade,"First things first. I did not buy my rotors from this seller... I have a 2003 tacoma and while I do not consider myself a fast driver I move pretty quick and because of my style of driving I would warp stock rotors. After several turning of stock rotors on a latheand finally replacing 2 sets of rotors I up graded to slotted &cross drilled rotors and it fixed everything!! No more warping and the brake performance was improved noticeably!! No fade at all, very consistence every time I hit the brakes, even when I was pulling my 15foot trailer."
1,There was Definitley Drama but that didn't mean...Nothing,"There was definitley drama but that did not make this a good book. The author was definitley trying to make the story reflect the title in every way. Eventually you just get to the point where you are like ""Are u serious."" Plenty of people die, plenty ofbaby mamma drama, and police stuff, but that did not help the book. Instead it made things worse because Hines did not take time to develop the characters instead she jumped with the plot.Rarley do I have a tough time getting through an urban fiction novel, but in this case it was a difficult task. The end was definitley a surprise, but it didn't really make any sense. The author didn't really explain the situation with Mekhai and we have no idea how Destiny knew all along. I still don't understand that part. Save your money on this book, it is predictable, hard to follow and not very entertaining."
5,THE DRAMA WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!!!!!!!,"When the going gets tough, it gets going. Just like everyone else I could not put the book down. You are immediately drawn in from the fight that goes and the murder. And that is just the beginning of DRAMA! The author gives some good twist with unexpected turns. This Definitely Was a Good Read And Happy That It Made #9 For ESSENCE MAGAZINE BEST-SELLER'S LIST. Tia Hines did the damn thang! Go on girl, hurry with that next one."
1,Looks are decieving,"After reading the reviews one would thing this book could be read in one day. I usually favor books by what the reviews read,afterall we depend on others to determine if we should buy, rent or borrow. For this book,I should have just left it alone on the bargain shelf in Barnes & Noble. It usually take me about a week and a half (between work & family) to finish a book, but DRAMA took me a month. I've had other good books waiting to be read, but i wanted to finish what i started.Yes, it had it good times but mostly it was just an boring read."
5,One of the best translations out there.,"The NASB is in the forefront of Biblical scholarship, and if you want to own only one copy of the Bible (word for word translation) and you are a non-Catholic Christian, then I would tell you to seriously consider this version (I would point Catholics towards the NRSV or NAB). The NASB does not use inclusive language, it is a very strict interpretation but flows smoothly, and also tends to favor the traditional phrasing.The NASB has traditionally been awarded the title of ""the most literally accurate translation"", and while I don't believe this to be 100% accurate, I think it's close on the mark. The NASB does benefit from excellent scholarship, and from major advances in Biblical discovery from the last few decades. Throw in the benefit of the cost of this Bible, which is very inexpensive, and you have an excellent Bible to use for a long time. In addition, the concordance at the back of this bible is frosting on the cake."
3,Good but could be better,"They did a good job of formatting the bible for the Kindle. However, there are no cross references and it's quite a bit of work to jump from location to location (go to index, page to the desired book, page to the desired chapter, page to the desired verse). Not sure how they could have made it better but maybe take advantage of the keyboard."
5,"An excellent, inexpensive way to get your hands on a Bible","Although not terribly far advanced in my Greek studies I have been able to see that the New American Standard is a far better translation than most translations out there. Because of the Lockman Foundation's licensing the NAS is usually a more expensive version, but this is a great deal on one. The print is a good size and there is a concordance in the back which is somewhat larger than most I've seen. There are no cross references in the text, which is not much of a loss in my opinion. What I like best about this Bible is that it lays flat when it's open. That can sometimes be hard to find in hardbacks and is almost impossible to find in paperbacks."
4,Great For Certain Purposes,"A lot of Bible reading programs have you read different sections of the Bible. This is especially hard to do with this Kindle version. If you are attempting to read through the Bible, I would highly recommend using a program that allows you to read a New Testament selection and then an Old Testament selction. This is helpful because if you're reading in Deuteronomy, you will need a break from reading about all the sacrifices and such. Since this kind of reading program is SO helpful, I would highly recommend not using this Kindle version for reading through the Bible. But I would recommend using a normal, paper Bible. Of course this Bible is pretty easy to navigate and is quite useful if you're not in a hurry."
3,Navigation not the best,"You really have to keep going back to the table of contents to navigate to different books. It would be helpful to even be able to tab back to the start of a particular book to choose the chapter you want, but that only seems to be available when you first go to the book. If I'm reading in chapter 2 and want to jump to another passage in chapter 18, that's a lot of pages to tab through!I'm happy to have this version on my Kindle, just wish they'd find a way to upgrade navigation options to be more user friendly. I've also downloaded an English Standard Version, and this one allows me to enter exactly where I want to go- book, chapter & verse!"
1,"The version is great, the format SUCKS!",This is my first e-bible and I am severely disappointed. There is no easy way to navigate between the Bible chapters. I was expecting to be able to navigate from book to book and from chapter to chapter down to verse. Without typing in the specific book chapter and verse each time you can't quickly go to it. I use Bible Gateway on my iPod but it requires internet and I wanted the Bible without internet. If I could return this book and get my money back I would!
1,Where are the notes and cross references?,The Explantion of the General Format in the preface of the Kindle version of NASB Holy Bible talks about notes and cross references that are placed in a cloumn adjoining the text on the page. These notes and cross refenaces are not included in the Kindle verson of this book. I returned my copy for this reason.
2,EXTREMELY small print,Before ordering this BIBLE I took a look inside. It is not single column as it appears and the print is extremely tiny. I would send it back but it cost me so little. My eyes are not the best so I am unable to use this BIBLE.
4,Greek Verbs Translated,I really like my NASB version in my Kindle. It is easy to navigate. The best thing about a NASB version is the Greek verbs are all in today's best translation. In a bible study the pastor and retired pastor get into discussions about Greek verbs but the NASB has that all done and no one else really cares whether it is in super pluperfect or whatever. I have been KJV and NKJV for many decades but I am a NASB now. I can just read the words and understand it to be in today's language.
5,Holy Bible: New American Standard Bible,"Written in plain english. Very easy to understand and follow. I have always enjoyed reading the bible, this bible makes it even more rewarding and is a great way to study the bible."
3,NASB Bible,"Hard to get to a particular verse because the book is not indexed. Alot of page turning to get where you want to be.However, I do enjoy and prefer this translation."
5,The WORD,This translation of the Bible is accurate and easy to understand. It's been my favorite for more than thirty years. I give the NASB as gifts often.
2,NASB Bible,I am disappointed that there is no way to go directly to a chapter or verse. You have to scroll through an entire book to get to a specific chapter.
3,Bible in book format,"For what it is it is, i.e. the Bible as a book, it is OK. You navigate it like a book. I was hoping for something like an App where it had references and you could jump to them or do a concordance search. I had a little program on my Palm for the NIV that did that sort of thing and I was hoping for something like that. Probably my naivety in being new to using a tablet resulted in me not getting exactly what I wanted. But it is what it says it is, the NASB Bible in book form. I have always liked this translation but this version does not have the footnotes and references that my paper bible has."
4,Every day reading for all ages,Easy reading. Would recommend it to anyone wishing to understand what the Bible has for each of us. Use for Sunday services during pastor's sermon to compare with translation being used.
3,Navigation on Kindle Touch,"I love the NASB version of the Bible. However, the kindle version is not very user friendly. I'm using a KindleTouch. I could navigate to the correct Bible book easy enough, but it always took me to the first chapter of that book. So for instance, I'm looking for Isaiah Ch 43 but it directs me to Isaiah ch 1. I have to flip through every chapter until I reach ch 43. That can take a while."
2,No search capability,It didn't meet my expectation. I was looking for an app that I can look up Chapter and Verse. It would be great if I just needed something to read.
5,Best New Testament Translation Available,"The Greek is translated into English in a very literal and concise fashion so you can tell you are not getting a paraphrase. Also, the vocabulary is not oversimplified and ""dumbed-down"" like so many other contemporary Bible translations."
4,Great Literal Translation,"This is a great literal translation for the serious Bible student. I own many translations and this one is the most reliable I have found when it comes to translations from the Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic languages. I do wish this program had a good search function to speed up my moving from text to text, maybe in future versions it will be better."
5,New American Standard Bible/Paperback,This is a very nice paperback bible and my first one with the New American Standard translation. This is probably the easiest to understand translation. The quality of the paper and print is excellent. The print is a reasonable size for this small book. It has maps and concordance. A perfect size to carry in your handbag or backpack. It's a bargain for the modest price I paid for it.
5,Not just a book,"For those of you who are rating this as a book, I feel compelled to share with you that this is not just another fiction book! Jesus truly lived, died, & was risen from the dead several years ago. Don't believe me? Just start investigating it & he will show you!!! You can read about Josephus who lived back in the days, yet was not christian. You can ask people from the middle eastern countries about their ancestors & learn that they are characters from the bible. Most importantly, you can just whisper as much to Jesus Christ & he will hear you & show you the truth! Seek & you will find these answers!!!"
2,Interesting,"This book was entertaining for the most part, full of a mixture of stories ranging from the absurd to semi-useful to outrageously violent. Like most mythologies, there are lessons presented in the parables of the book that could benefit its readers, but I would not recommend for children under 18, especially the rather graphic chapters detailing torture and incest."
2,Holy Bible,"I don't actually hate the Bible, but I don't know how to use this Kindle version. How do you go directly to a passage you want to read?"
3,estou procurando,"Ola bom dia tudo bem? Quero agradecer pela esístncia do site, por meio dele estou conseguindo completar minha coleo.eu sou pesquisador das escrituras sagrada e ja tenho varias edies,inclusive a Nova Verso Padro Americano.Mas a que estou a procura no momento e a antiga: Verso Padro Americano,(original usada)de 1901 ou de 1944.Atenciosamente: Claudio."
3,Chapters,"The ease of this book on the kindle is very nice . However, I really really really do not like that I cannot easily go to a chapter and verse. I realistically can not keep flipping pages to get to chapter 13 of a book. Major flaw."
3,Its OK,This product does what it is expected to do and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone at all.
3,NASB paper back,"The translation is pretty good. However I cannot say I recommend the font for this particular edition. A bit small to my liking, and the strokes are rather thick, making it harder for me to read. I like bigger letter with thin stroke. It is not prohibiting by anymeans, just not preferable."
1,navigation,"difficult to navigate..pretty disappointing. Call up Joshua from the Table of Contents; then type in 3 for Chapter 3....it takes you to every ""3"" in the bible...Jehovah, Exodus...etc. better not take it to Church...you will be last on the pew to find the scripture. When looking for a particular verse you need the verses before and after to have context...so if it would just bring up the chapter quickly you could find the verse much easier"
3,best of what's out there,"Ebook Bibles still need a lot of work to be perfect, but this is the best of what's out there"
2,Performance on Kindle Fire is painful.,"I am really disappointed in the speed and performance of this bible. Even opening it can take as long as 30 seconds. Moving from book to book is just as painfully slow. It also crashes all the time. It is really, really bad on Kindle Fire. For that matter, I have not found a single bible for Kindle Fire (and i have purchased 5 now ... NASB, NLT, AMP, ASV, ESV) and all are fairly pathetic in terms of performance and navigation and features that should enrich bible study as opposed to hindering it)."
4,cheap and good,"Good translation, nice cheap, simple, decent sized bible to carry around. If you're looking for a study bible, go elsewhere, but if you just want something basic for really cheap, this is it.My only complaint is there are no book-verse listing of the old testament citations in the new testament. Otherwise, grand."
1,Not A Catholic Edtion,"This is not a Catholic Edition. When I attempted to use it to prepare as a Lector I discovered the book of Wisdom is missing. Along with it: Tobit, Judith, Maccabees 1 & 2, Sirach ...When I performed the search in Kindle to find a ""Catholic New American Bible"" this popped up as part of the choices. It should not have appeared! I am not happy to have spent the money since my budget is tight.Please remove this from the search when the word ""Catholic"" is part of key words."
3,Good for young person or student,I chose this Bible for my 12 yo student. It has a good cover and it is bound well. It lays on the table flat and can take a lot of abuse. The print is a pretty good size for young ones who may still have a bit of reading difficulty. The words of Jesus are not in red which is a good thing as the red letters fade with time. Good price for the product. It should last for years.
3,New American Standard Bible,I was disappointed with the ease of looking for different verses. Seemed slow and ackward. Other books have not been that way so it isn't my I-Pad. Will probably try to find another one in the future that is easier to use as a reference tool.
2,NASB,"It is not very search friendly. Only able to select a book, but not a chapter. I end up scrolling way too much."
3,Smaller than I thought,"Advertised as a pew bible, I found this book smaller than any I've ever found in the back of any pew. The size 8 type is readable, but not generous. I would have given four stars if the paper was not so thin that the ink on the opposite side of the paper shows through on the side I'm trying to read.Overall, it's not bad for 6 or 7 dollars. I'll probably go brick and mortar and grab a $60 copy of something more usable, that I can browse before I buy, but this one is alright for looking up verses for comparison between versions. It's usable."
3,Good basic bible,Would be nice to have better navigation. Show where you are at all time would be very helpful. God's word is always good.
2,Not User Friendly,I had a time trying to figure out how to use it. It is not easy going from Book to Book.
3,Navigation problems,"We found that navigating to a verse was not as easy as we had hoped, so we're trying another version from Amazon. We are new Kindle users with lots to learn, so in reality we likely need better instructions on how to find our way around."
4,Very Useful,"Found this item to be user friendly and like the highlighting feature. One thing I would encourage to be changed is to provide the chapter and verse in lieu of the ""page"" number. Good to be able to see what has been highlighted for reference, but the only way to acutally know where it is found is to click on the highlight.But really enjoy having the app with me at all times to read anywhere."
4,easy for research and Bible verses,I am involved in a book club reading a religious book which has references to passages of the Bible. This Bible version makes easier understanding of the words stated and also is great for Kindle in trying to find the chapter and verse easily.
5,Just the thing for a rainy day!,"Received the AutoVentShade window vents promptly, and installed them promptly as we had a warm day. They were east to install as the instructions are clear and easy to understand. They look nice on my Jeep Liberty, and as we had freezing rain the next day I know that they work great for keeping the side windows clear. Very happy."
4,Great picture and reception...,Great picture and reception for a small inexpensive TV/VCR combination. On screen menues somewhat confusing and not as easy as many other sets I've used. Sound is acceptable for a small TV - the kids prefer headsets in the van.
3,I Think It Has A 9 Inch Screen,"I gave it 3 stars to be neutral because I haven't really seen this TV/VCR in person.I just wanted to say that I think it has a 9 inch screen based on the size of the slot for the VHS tape, and the CXJ0932 model number (the 09 part), and the other TV/VCR combos that are brought up as alternatives.It seems kinda expensive for what you're getting though."
2,Better off reading on the internet,"This book is so general, the only thing that's special is that it tells you about the origin of the breed... which you can read about easily online. I wouldn't waste my time. However, this book is much better than the other Shiba book on Amazon, which makes this book look like 8 stars."
2,repetitive and boring,"I am not usually one to give a negative comment to anything, but i was very disappointed with this book. The first half of the book kept repeating the same information: AKC guidelines, how the breed looks, etc. The second half of the book had some okay content in terms of basic training, but the whole book seems boring and dated. I regret paying $10 for the same info I can get by googling ""shiba inu""....."
3,Average Book,"The book is OK. Nothing special. Most of the book is written about dogs in general, not just about Shibas. Maybe a good book for people that have never had a dog or people wanting to showtheir Shiba. Good price and greating shipping.!"
2,Not good for PhDs,"This book is NOT good for advanced degree candidates trying to get a job in consulting. One problem is that the book does NOT stress the importance of trying to find non-trivial and key points in case interviews. There is too much emphasis on frameworks. In real interview you don't have time to go and explore all elements of a framework. Instead you often need to quickly identify key issues and present out-of-the-box ideas. If you are PhD, after reading that book, you'll get inclined in the somewhat wrong direction. You may do better if you never heard of frameworks and don't care about absolute completeness of your answer, but use your time to find ""think different"" ideas. (It is possibly not the case for MBA's though.)"
5,A Must Have For Anyone Doing A Consulting/Case Interview,"If you're thinking about walking into an interview with a management consulting firm, I highly recommend you read this booklet first. If anyone you're interviewing against has read it and you haven't, they've got a great advantage over you.I felt totally relaxed in my interviews after having read over the practice case questions. While the booklet is not a replacement for practice, it is a must read before you begin interviewing."
2,Agree with reviews below,I found this report was disappointing and out of date. A more useful report on case interviews is the Vault.com 2002 Guide to the Case Interview or the harvard guide to consulting.
5,The Best Video On Fly Casting,"This is the best fly fishing instructional video I have seen. Joan explains the processes of casting in a very clear, concise manner. The video is produced exceptionally well and is a pleasure to watch. I have been fly casting for over 40 years and still can get refresher tips from this video. I have recommended it to many people that I know.The Queen of Fly Casting still reigns!"
5,Excellent!,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Never tire of viewing. Great information for the beginner and expert alike. Will be viewing this for the entire Winter. Joan is an excellent instructor and fine contributor to the world of angling
4,Almost perfect,"This could have five stars easily if it hadn't been for all the product placement and then the blatant adverts. I don't understand why I have to deal with ads when I paid for a DVD. If it was a free vid, then, yeah, okay. Still and all, it is a great video. Everything is clearly described, then demonstrated, often several times from several angles. Don't get me wrong. It ain't easy. You'll have to watch this many, many times and practice a lot before it sinks in. Ms. Wulff's basic technique, though, is easy to learn, easy to master: Pick up, snap, drift. The secret is when and how long to do each step. It's both easier and harder than you'd expect. But the result is worth it."
1,fly casting basics,I am beginner fly fisherman and I found these basics very helpful in getting started.
5,Philippians and Colossians,nice brand new book ..all clean and fresh and just what we hoped it would be as it was for a gift
1,"quality construction, but trying to return it","Good solid case design and well engineered buttons. This feels like it will last. Charged quickly as designed.The UI was well designed, but had the major down fall as it is a very small package.The sound over the provided headphones (on FM) was crisp and clear, no noticeable static.Unfortunately this was the only good part.You are required to use their proprietary software to use this device.This means that it is not compatible with Windows Media Player, or other PC-Device sync software.The software required to import music was not supported on my computer and would simply hang the entire machine. This software is not compatible with newer processors, and does not support ""home built"" or Multimon machines. It also required Administrator level permissions to access the device, so it was not useable by all the people who use my machine.All of this meant that I was not able to use this to listen to any of my music."
3,software didn't work,"I haven't figured out entirely how to use this yet. The frustration began when the DVD wouldn't download. I had to go through a chat session with Sony for them to then send me a link to their web site. I downloaded the software from there. It's also crazy that you can't turn it off from the FM radio mode and that wasn't in the manual- I had to find it on the Web.Once I get it up and running I should know if I actually like this MP3 player, or not."
2,Can't download podcasts or audiobooks -- at least not easily,"I'll agree with everyone else's comments re. the proprietary software. I wanted to get an mp3 player to listen to podcasts and audiobooks in addition to music. I had no problems importing music from CDs to the player, but after multiple hours trying to figure it out, still can't download podcasts from itunes -- since you can't get podcasts on the Sony site! From what I can figure out, you have to burn those onto disk and then download them to the player. I'm returning this and finding something less tedious."
1,Worst MP3 Player Ever,It is imposible to rearange the order of the songs once they are on the device. The proprietary software is horrible DO NOT BUY
2,nice mp3 player - horrible software.,"like i said, i have no complaints about the player. once you get the music on there, it's amazing.however, getting the music on there is a rediculously confusing process. the software experience on most computers with Vista operating systems ranges from considerable hardships to not working at all. also, even if you get it working(good luck with that) you'll still run in to insane restrictions as far as ripping from cd's goes.don't bother buying this. spend a little more to get an iPod or even a sanDisk... my experiences with those brands have been 99% better."
1,don't buy,"The ""player"" only works with Sony Sonic Stage. The player is not bad, but what good is it if you struggle to load music. Let me begin, Sonic stage 4.0 kept crashing my dell pentium 4 running XP Pro. Upgraded to 4.3. 4.3 sonic stage will not run. Called sony support, did what they said, still will not run. I am now stripping my computer down and resetting it up. Will it run? I have now vowed not to buy anything made by sony."
2,If it wasn't for the awful software...maybe,"The player seems to work only through Sony's SonicStage music management software, but even that failed to recognize the player. In short: the gizmo looked good, it was even kind of cute, but since I wasn't able to make it work, it is going back to the store.It was supposed to replace my 20BG iPod, which has a nasty tendency to freeze up during workouts. At least Apple's ""pride"" can be unlocked with a bit of trying and I can add music through iTunes - which after trying out SonicStage seems like a breath of fresh air...There must be some better mp3 players out there. Does ANY manufacturer produce an mp3 player (flash, or HD) that lasts and doesn't lockup? Any suggestions?"
2,does NOT do what it claims,"You buy an mp3 player to play your mp3's, right? Well, this player does not play your mp3's.This is a cool little player. The invisible readout feature is cool. The fact that it charges by plugging into your computer's usb port is cool.However, it claims to play mp3's and wma's. It does not. It can convert your existing files to play, but it can't play them. So, if you already have files, and you want to load them onto the player, you will have to convert them with sonicstage first, then transfer them on. This is very inconvenient, and will take up double the space on your hard drive.If you don't already have mp3's or wma's, or if you are already using sonicstage, this is a good player. Otherwise, it does not do what you are buying it for."
2,Could have been great.....,"Nice design, good sound, and decent interface.Pros:LightweightHolds a surprising amount of musicFeels like it could take a beatingPocketsizedCons:Finger print ladenSonicStage software is horrible to use with Vista (not much better with XP)No accessories availableDisplay was hard to readNo expansion slotI really would love to say how great this is but the Software doesn't work, AT ALL on Vista! SonicStage is the only program you're able to use to transfer your music with, no drag and drop. After a week of trying to make software work, I boxed it up and exchanged it for a Sansa 250e. The Sansa was $30 more and will aloow you to drag and drop files with no software required. Sorry Sony you screwed up, you should know better than this!"
3,"Great design, flawed software","The design of this Sony is very sleek and stylish. The FM tuner works great and is a nice feature to have. Once you get the music on the player it works very well and has a long battery life. Therein lies the problem. You can only use the proprietary Sony software to load the music, so if you are already used to using windows media player or Real Networks player you are out of luck. The Sony player isn't too bad per se, but it's something new you must learn how to use and the interface is a little clunky. I set this up for my father-in-law and there is no way he is going to be able to load songs himself. I just wish all of these different companies would allow you to transfer music files using any of the available software. I give the device 5 stars for design and function, but 1 star for the software."
1,This ring is not enormous,This ring is 1.75 inches from the tip of the diamond to the end of the band. The rings around the engagement ring are about a half an inch in diameter.
4,Good Eurodance,"As soon as this CD was released, it immediately topped all the charts in Europe. No wonder, was it promoted on almost every ski area in Austria and Switzerland! And exactly those people are the ones that listen to this kind of music.Europeans don't care about lyrics or something. All they want to do is dnace. And that is more than just possible to this well produced CD. So, if you are looking for something special, or better: Great music, then you are at the wrong address. But if you just want a well produced party album, then here you go!"
5,Chicago Bears Slippers,Amazon had the slippers when the NFL Shop was sold out! Awesome slippers! Quick delivery!
4,Good for beginner fans.,"This would be a great collection for beginning fans of Nightwish. Includes my personal favorites ""Wish I Had An Angel"" and ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". Tarja has a gorgeous voice. Depressingly, they have decided that a change of vocalists is needed. For all those new to Nightwish, listen to this. Missing songs like ""She is my Sin"" and ""Planet Hell""."
5,Best Nightwish CD out there!,"I have been listening to Nightwish since the band formed long long time ago. They have many great albums, but this one is definitely their best CD! (Because it is an accumulation of all their best songs : ))I would rate each song separately, but since I have a midterm tomorrow, I am going to keep this short. All the songs are great : ) Some take a while to grow on you, while others are an instantaneous hit. I would say which songs I think are the best, but that is something best discovered by oneself alone.In summary, if you like orchestral metal/goth metal, this is the CD for you. Nightwish doesn't get better than this! I highly recommend this CD."
2,Not the greatest hits,"I found this band when I heard the song 'sleeping sun.' I loved the song so much, I then decided to buy the cd. Since it contained the version of the song I wanted, out of the entire cd this is the only song that is good. The rest are not the greatest. I wouldn't recommend this cd unless you are a TRUE DIEHARD fan and not someone*like me* who just came across this band by accident. Unless the other cds they have are better then this, you better save your money and just download the songs you like."
5,Hooray!,Great hits from a great band! These are their older songs while they still had Tarja singing who in my opinion is better and greatly missed.
3,Why did they kill the vocals on a few of the songs... the originals were better,"Love all of these songs, however you're better off buying the original albums. For example on ""Sleeping Sun"" the powerful, deep, original vocals were replaced with some high pitched non-powerful version. Since when does Tarja's voice need a cheesy chorus effect to sound powerful?BTW nightwish is awesome, get the albums and skip this compilation."
5,Awesome shirt,"Having bought my fair share of dress shirts, I can honestly say this one is completely worth it. I love the fit and look."
2,Watered down game theory,"The idea is very interesting, but the book is a result of reducing theory into a few sentences, and then repeating it over and over again. Good for airplane reading between business trips, though."
3,"Decent, old ideas in new packaging","You'd be better off working through Competitive Strategy by Michael Porter, there's nothing in here that isn't in Porter's book. This books is a little easier to read for the casual reader however and does have more examples to explain the topics."
3,Takes effort to keep reading,Not one of those books that keeps your interest. I had to motivate myself to keep going but gave up after reading half of it.
3,A Watered-Down Version of Playing Win-Win,"For a book that is promoted as THE business book based on game theory, there is surprisingly very little about game theory, or about games at all.A lot of its premise have been on how you can add value, even to your competitors, so that you increase the pie, and thus play win-win. Unfortunately, this isn't the case for all kinds of competitive business situations.Nalebuff's previous book,Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Lifeis a much better thesis on on how you can use game theory in business."
3,The framework makes sense,"This book put those business games into a nice framework, it is probably the best one after ""Thinking Strategically""."
4,What Game Theory has to offer in Business...,"...is on the most pressing issues of it all: finding the right strategies and making the right decisions. Maybe a missed a lot on business education, but i never thought of complements. Or the effect of myself entering a market or not having an impact on the whole game. Not even in my MBA did we cover such profounde topic. The authors cover very well the ground of Game Theory applied to business and how companies cooperate in order to enlarge a market and that compete in splitting the market share. Very readable book, even though it gets a bit boring after reading half through."
5,"Lesser-known National Parks, a fine introduction:","Biscayne, Katmai, North Cascades, Guadelupe Mountains, Voyageurs, Theodore Roosevelt, Channel Islands: Not seven of the best-known National Parks to be sure. But each is eminently deserving of inclusion into the system of ""Nation's Crown Jewels"". This book shows why.In a well-drafted, readable, interesting text, accompanied by excellent National Geographic photography, the ins and outs of each named park, including highlights, topography, natural features, climate, hazards, and accessibility are brought out in an imaginative, pleasant manner.Each park is shown to be a microcosm of a facet of the American wilderness, and each chapter makes you want to visit that park. I have been to Theodore Roosevelt and Biscayne. both were fascinating, and this book helped whet my appetite. I was never misled.This is a real keeper for any traveler's national park library.Five stars."
5,Rivoting,"It is an eye opener to the reality of living with deeply abused and disturbed children. The encouragement it gives to all of us who struggle with difficult behaviour in children is immeasurable, giving hope where there is none. Nancy and her family write so openly and honestly about their experiences sharing their triumphs over attachment disorder.I would highly recommend any who is involved with abused children to read this real life account."
2,Disturbing,"It is a compelling story, but poorly written and completely uneditedNancy Thomas tells more about herself than she knows. She comes off as a very insecure, neurotic woman who tries to fill her emotional void by taking in too many kids."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed this book!!!,"In fact I had a VERY difficult time putting it down so that I could get some sleep!!! Although I could easily relate to many of the experiences discussed by Nancy Thomas, it was so neat to get a confirmation of my experiences with RAD kids and the system!!! Great going, Nancy!!!"
3,Clie Book,"I am an experienced Clie user and I did not find this book very useful at all. If you are a NEW PDA user, then this book might be for you. All others, leave it at the bookstore!"
1,Do not purchase this product,This has to be the worst pillow I have ever purchased. Its fluffiness lasted exactly one week. Now I just use it to prop myself up. I was very disappointed with this product. Please keep your money. Do not purchase this pillow.
3,Not bad at all,Pretty well done and worth the read. While not the best 'biker genre' book I've read but certainly not the worst it's .....ok
4,A very nice glove!,"Being a bit of a glove freak, these went with the rest of my collection perfectly. They are quite well made, very warm and look great. I normally wear a size small or sizes six so the 6 fit perfectly as they seem to be down sized. Not that I go rock climbing in these things, but they have worn well and still look quite good after a winter's use. The lining feels great!"
5,Beautiful!,I grew up watching this version of the Little Mermaid! The animation is just wonderful! I also LOVE the original story of the Little Mermaid. Her devotion to her prince and sacrifice is so much deeper than Disney's happy endings. I was so thrilled to find this version on Amazon! I am so happy that I can share this story now with my own daughter!
3,Ok I guess,"product looks nice, matches the ladybug betset very well. downfall - its not flat, it appears to be bent which is weird considering its ceramic. Not sure how to secure it to the wall with having this issue!"
5,Rex and Rex 2,My son is five years old and he loves books to begin with. We ended up driving to Mr. Gould's office since we couldn't find the series at any of the stores. My son and I got to meet Mr.Gould and Mr. Epstein. What a WONDERFUL experince for my son. That evening we read the books. The illustrations are brilliant. My son loved every page. Asking me if they were real!!! Thank you Mr. Gould and Mr. Epstein for your SUPER books. We will be waiting for PATCH at your front door! I wish I had books like these when I was a child.
5,Rex,I got this book and the next one in the series for my 7 year old son. He is crazy about dinosaurs and this is his favorite book. He reads it over and over. He likes it because it has photos that look real and not cartoonish. He also loves the idea that there is a secret world that only kids know about and that there is a mystery involved. He can't wait for the rest of the series. I wish I could find it for him. The story is basically about a group of kids who find a secret way to get into another world where dinosaurs still live. But there are also mysterious men tracking them. I have learned that there are more books in the series taking the kids to other points in history. I can't wait to find them for my son.
5,Word Perfect Is Word Is Not,"I started my college career, using Apple, and it was fine. Then the college switched to Word Perfect and Word. I tried both and fell in love with Word Perfect because I found it to be exactly suited to my needs. Recently, my computer was upgraded and I lost my Word Perfect. I was forced to use Word. I HATE IT, especially that stupid sun wanting to help me type a letter. I am an accomplished typist,(90WPM for the last 40+ years). I don't want Word or its templates. I want what Word Perfect allows me to do--type my manuscripts, quickly and efficiently without over-riding my typing decisions. A friend recently said Word was invented for people who either couldn't type or couldn't format. That's fine for them. But for the rest of us, thank goodness WordPerfect is still around, because we much prefer the ease of using the Word Perfect processing system."
1,Do NOT buy from Rock Rebel Clothing,"Rock Rebel Clothing appears to believe that false excuses justify a complete lack of service. As I patiently waited nearly 7 weeks this t-shirt, I was first told their recent move was delaying the order, then later told the item was `preorder' - neither of these excuses were EVER noted on their website. They even sent me an ""item shipped"" notice, when the item never actually shipped! God bless Amazon's A-Z guarantee for refunding my money for an item I never received. I hope Amazon can find a competent seller of Affliction t-shirts."
1,Not what was offered,"These ""DVDs"" are in reality CDs, therefor not what was expected, and only audio files.Nevertheless good to have them, but it would be nice to buy what is shown."
2,interesting but confusing,"This is a good overview of Napolean's rule. The only real complaint I have is the long paragraphs, and no chapters. There are no breaks it seems. However this book originally was written a while back so part of it could just be style. Another thing is one second you feel like you're reading a history text book the next it's like historical fiction.I was pleased for the fact that I was just interested in knowing more about him but wasn't overly impressed either."
3,ordinary,i choose napoleon bonaparte to know his war exploits but it has nothing significant. nothing about watreloo and not much about his philosphy on leadership
5,Dog happy,"These are great. Easily delivered worldwide through the mail. My dogs love them. As my dogs have little legs they can't run along when I go for a bike ride. I strap them on and they are totally relaxed. The wind blows up their nose, they get a fabulous view and they love it. When they pass other dogs they look down their noses at them. They feel steady and secure."
3,"Well built, too small","The carrier is made well, however over 10 pounds means one or two pounds over. Not made for a pug!!"
3,Makes pet fall forward,"I bought this for my cat, who is fat and long. He loved it, but I had to hold him up while he was in it because there is no way to adjust the top. Therefore, my cat just fell forward and slouched over. I think it would have worked if there was a way to ensure that he would not fall forward. Also, it was too short for him in length. His arms wouldn't fit under the top straps, so they had to rest on top of them. He didn't seem to mind. I really wish this product would have worked out because I need a way to carry him around without using my hands."
2,My Westie Didn't Like It,"I didn't like it either - the straps fall off shoulders easily. I have a 11 pound Westie and while she was in it, she was devising a plan to get me back for the embarrassment I probably caused her (and me). I still have it for if an emergency comes up like Armageddon or something where I need to carry her, but it is just taking up space in my cabinets."
4,Tika's Travels,"I bought this for my 10.5lb Chihuahua/Miniature Pinscher mix a while back. I primarily use it for going on bike rides with her. It's made very well and even has a tail hole! The only complaint I have about it is that the top area that goes around her chest is much too big. I've made some personal adjustments with a few stitches so it does fit much better. When we're on bike rides, I let her know she's SUPER DOG! She loves how close she is kept to me in this carrier."
2,* NOT FOR PUGS *,"The description says ""for pets over 10 lbs"" but it doesn't indicate the maximum weight. My pug is 15 pounds and he keeps falling because the velcro straps couldn't support his weight. I would like the product more if it had a better description of the amount of weight it could support."
1,sent back,Well I ordered this for my dog.Had to send it back because the wrong size was shipped.Never again.
