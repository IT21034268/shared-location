1,Book smelled moldy,The book smelled moldy. I think reading it could be hazardous to one's health by inhaling mold spores. I think this book smelled moldy enough to have actually come around the horn on a sailing ship.
3,Frustrating but honest dealing,Defective book. Charges and mailing were returned. At least they were honorable but it was highly frustrating.
3,Cheesy chic flick but I liked it,"I wasn't expecting anything more than a cheesy chic flick when I rented this. And that's basically what I got. However, the characters are acted well, the story line had some funny parts, and the plot was much deeper than I expected. I would recommend it."
1,AWEFUL!,"This movie was crude and just plain stupid! Not worth the time to watch it! My mom had breast cancer, and she didn't look hideous, but Meg Ryan sure did in this movie. I watched it because of Kristen Stewart and the main character had been on Smallville once. Wish I hadn't wasted my time!"
4,In the Land of Women,"I really liked this movie..I guess it was Meg Ryan....that did it for me..Kristin Stewart was okay, but the interaction between Our romantic lead Adam Bordy and Meg Ryan is touching and an interesting twist...I don't think that you will be disappointed in this Movie. I know it isn't new but it is really worth a look."
4,great cast,"meg ryan, kristan stewart, adam brody, I am not sure when this was released. I missed it in the theaters, limited action but great story"
3,interesting film,saw this film the other night and it had some interesting elements. Adam Brody portrays a writer in this film and he is finding himself. Meg Ryan is his Neighbor and she also has Breast Cancer and they become very close. He also becomes close to her daughter as well. so many different things are going on in this film. Brody's Grandmother in this film is a stone cold trip and cracked me up. she was the most on Point character in the film.it wasn't a comedy but it did have some moments that would trip you out.
4,Almost human,"As chick flicks go, this movie is really pretty good.At least I didn't bored what with high school kidsfighting, affairs. grandmas dying and break ups withpopular singing stars. Meg Ryan hardly resembles herself,but acts well. Adam Brody plays his lost puppy act."
2,Not Very Pleased,"The product looked boot-legged. The covering to the product looked like it was printed off the computer. I guess with paying only about $2 for it, I cannot complain. I just wish that it was the original covering and disk."
4,It really is good for what it is!,"This movie has no pretentions towards Oscar or any other awards. However, the story is entertaining; the directorial timing is impecable; the plot introduces multiple topics which are largely common, but doesn't dwell on any subject beyond endurance; beautifully filmed; no digression into sexual situations; no sexual overtones of a younger man interested in either an older woman or a teenager; absolutely accurate gestures by the teenage girl; great presence by Adam Brody; etc.The film is watchable over and over again as pure entertainment. Don't look for what you don't find. Life is at least complicated in the multiple vignettes we experience - some our own and others viewed from afar."
4,Looking for Kristen,"We found her, in yet another sensitive and very compelling role. She never dissappoints, when it comes to bringing her character to life! She struggles as a teenager, to overcome her insecurities with her mother, who is facing a crisis of her own. Together they share a interest, in a young handsome man, who helps them both, face their futures together."
4,In the land of women,"Great movie. The grandmother makes it worth watching. I enjoyed all the characters and what they brought to the movie. It made me laugh, cry and think about what it would really feel like to be any of them. Enjoy!"
4,Pretty good,"I love this movie. It's really good and the audience grows to care about the characters. The only problem I had with it was the lack of bonus features. Bonus features are the thing I look forward to most in a DVD, especially if I've already seen the movie. Sadly, this DVD didn't have ANY extras, but was still worth the purchase. All the actors are great in this movie."
4,Every day is special,"Each day of the year has a special Catholic tidbit of information. Some are for small children, for pre-teens, for adults, for lapsed Catholics, and some are just plain interesting!The booklet isn't really intended as a classroom type reading, but instead, as a handy book to just offer a starting point for further study."
3,Good general trivia - was hoping for more Catholic trivia,"The book contains very interesting facts. My six year old and I have enjoyed reading the daily facts. However, I was a little disappointed as I was hoping the facts would be less general and more religious in nature i.e., more about the church or saints lives, etc."
1,Lot's of learn Animals,Other two videos are great but this one my child don't like it waste of money.
5,Love love LOVE this Garfield!!,"For me, it was either this Garfield Chia pet or the Spongebob one. I am so glad I purchased this Garfield one! I planted the first round of seeds the evening I received my Chia pet, and he still has his green planted hair! I ordered and received my Garfield Chia pet about a month and a half ago, and it has lasted a lot longer than it says it will on the box. It is easy to use and easy to follow the instructions, so even the little ones can participate in growing things on a Chia pet."
4,In the Zone,"A very interesting read. The recipes could be a little more ""user"" friendly. But if you apply Sears' ideas, you can balance everything you eat. Definitely worth a read."
5,about the last review,"This review states that excessive protein consumption can prohibit calcium absorption. This only applies to animal protein, not soy protein. This is mention in the book."
1,Don't *buy* it!,"How can you trust a ""nutrition"" author who owns major stock in a biotech firm? Isn't that a conflict of interests? I am a strict vegetarian, and I eat soy almost daily, but Mr. Sears is a crock! Don't buy into the ""Zone"" diet -- soy or meat. You need a diet that is 1) whole, unadulterated food, 2) well-balanced. It's that simple, and natural."
1,Caution on eating soy...,"Soy is not necessarily the wonder food that this book purports it to be. Like most things, one should investigate both sides to every story including this one.For one, the Weston A Price Foundation cautions against using soy. Their research proves that soy should be avoided - contradicting Sears' claims.As always, use your head."
3,Blindfold:Acts of Obsession,I received the video 2 days after ordering abd in excellent condition.The video is O.K. Shannon Doherty's early work what do you expect.I recommend buying this video if you are a fan of Shannon Doherty.This product is only available on video tape.Enjoy.....
2,well....it's ok if......,"This is a typical no-brainer Grade-B suspense sex ""thriller"" I guess. It's really only good if you wnat to see a famous actress act sleazy and topless alot. In this case, Shannen Doherty from Beverly Hills 90210, that gal lots of us drooled over alot and fantasized about alot in the early 90s.Well, sometimes we guys get into that kind of sleazy, no-brainer VHS mood."
3,SHANNEN DOHERTY BARES IT ALL .....,A SO SO THRILLER WITH MISS 90210 TOPLESS ....WHAT CAN I SAY ....PRICE WUZ RIGHT FOR THE VIDEO ....FINE PICTURE ....4 SHANNEN FANZ ....
1,Not a quality item,"This router attachment for Dremel is very poorly made. The plastic flexes a lot. The three pole design doesn't really add any stability because the material is so flimsy. The height adjustment is simply a plastic bar which offers no accuracy at all. Bottom line, this item so cheaply made that it's almost unusable. The 'real' Dremel 335 router attachment is a way better product then this Milescraft knock off with only couple dollars more. I've returned this attachment and got a real Dremel one."
1,Got one use out of it.,"I'll start by saying ""you get what you pay for"". Except for a few parts, it's totally made of plastic, so the depth gauge didn't stay secured. As a result, I got uneven depth routes. The screws on the bottom of the three metal posts vibrated loose mid route. You can't tighten them without fear of cracking the plastic base (which I did -- and I didn't over tighten either). Once the base cracked at the screws, it's done. It's on it's way to recycling! Great idea, but bad design."
1,Dysfunctional is what comes to mind,"cheap plastic, cheap hardware and dysfunctional, horrible adjustment that is if you are lucky to get it where you wanted. I through it away and made my own out of MDF and threaded studs. don;t waist your money."
1,Milescraft 1000 Plunge,doesn't mention anywhere till you get it that it only fits obsolete dremal rotery tools.useless on anything else.save your money
4,Very handy for detail work,"I only have one issue and that is that you can't see you work after about 5 seconds, but I set a fan right next to the job and that seems to work well. Fantastic for small detail work."
4,Invite or Invites,Wanted to determine the proper usage for the verbs invite or invites as in - Millennium Productions cordially invites you to attend a dance and cocktail party or Millennium Productions cordially invite you to attend a dance and cocktail party - The book gave some examples with the words invite and invites listed but it did not give a specific reason when to properly use one or the other. Please advise
5,Gracefully written novel illuminates England's soul,"Edith Ashby, twice divorced, has led a busy and productive life in London. Her brother Alfred lives in the country, in the house that he and Edith grew up in. When she goes to visit him there, memories of her childhood and youth rise up to meet her; likewise, her presence triggers recollections - some of them deeply painful - for Alfred. The life experiences of these two siblings merge gently yet inevitably with the history of their native land. Colegate's descriptions are evocative and poignant, her observations astute and wise. This is a masterpiece of meticulous novel writing, and the perfect book for readers like myself who cherish the works of Anita Brookner and Penelope Fitzgerald."
4,Great Knife,"Kershaw make great knives, no question about it. Sharp, good quality, and really easy to open. The only problem I have with this knife is the G10 handles. The pattern is very ""sharp"" and chews up my pants material when I clip it to my pocket. I've had knives with G10 handles before and I always liked the lighter weight and the grip, but my previous knives have always had a smoother pattern than this."
3,Baby & Me Very Limited in Content of Activities,"I have a 16 month old daughter who has loved several other interactive computer programs designed for babies, including JumpStart Baby. She gets bored very quickly with Sesame Street Baby & Me, because the activities are very limited. For example, the program includes a game about shapes, but displays only four shapes over and over. There are several games that my daughter enjoys, such as ""Do What I Do Games"" and ""Do What I Do Songs,"" but even these games repeat the same activities too frequently and don't include enough variety to keep her attention very long. I would recommend this software to families that already have a variety of software and would like something to use occasionally. If you are planning on using this software often, it could be too monotonous."
5,"Very nice - well constructed, solid - stylish","I was very happy with these pulls - they are very heavy, high quality metal, and very well-made. The finish is excellent.Highly recommended!"
2,NOT streak-free. Does NOT work on glass.,"I do like this cleaner for anything BUT glass. It has a very pleasant scent, and does a great job on anything that is NOT glass. But having glass cleaner in the name and calling it streak-free, is COMPLETELY misleading. It streaks worse than anything I have ever seen, almost as though it actually contains grease! I used a generous amount on a bathroom mirror and went through several (nine!) paper-towels and a lot of muscle to get rid of the streaks. And they were still there! If you are looking to clean mirrors and windows with streak-free results, this is NOT the product."
1,Oh Dear!,"Well one could say that It is a feat to write a book at all, and especially at the age of 14! But I fear that Hasties attempts at humor are rather to infantile for the audience at which this book is aimed. The stories themselves, do, at least in outline have some merit, but the way in which they are written really does insult the originals genius. I have no doubt this is not the last we will here of Hastie and I do think there is some promise here, but in this book you really do have to look very hard."
1,very nice chain,Love this chain. It is very nice and thin. Love wearing it. Weareach day and never remove. Would recommend
2,Broke quickly,"This chain broke right away, the clasp came apart from the chain. I would not purchase this itme again, sorry."
2,"Good price, terrible loop","The loop broke just after a day of owning it but beside that it's a pretty chain. It was a waste of money but I might figure a way to repair this on my own somehow. Returning it would cost too much money. Be sure when you pull the loop back to open it, not go too far, otherwise it'll break (common in chains)."
3,too shiny,"Well, the chain by itself is good & durable.. looks pretty too. However, I broke my previous chain is why I ordered it. That was way thinner, a lil less shiny so looked more original.. this is as shiny as a spoon... I kept it coz returning is like loosing 50% of money and getting nothing.Good for people looking for something shiny."
4,Exactly as described,"The chain was not QUITE as delicate as I wanted, but it fit the description. A very bright silver finish. Well made, very sturdy. I was happy with the quality and value."
1,Turned black,It turned black in less than two days! It was a beautiful chain and it arrived on time but turned out to be cheap. I guess you get what you pay for!
2,Not so very thin,"Transaction was very smooth-Very quick shipping. However-i was looking for a very thin sterling silver chain-I was surprised and disappointed by how heavy and shiny fake looking this was, but I was not out a lot of money"
1,Rusted after one wear,"I ordered this chain for a pendant I already owned. After wearing it once, it lost it's color and started to rust. I do live close to the beach, but I am not sure if this has anything to do with it. Also, you get what you pay for..."
4,"Good product, fair price","I needed a chain for a pendant that I purchased, and this chain works very well. Appears to be good quality and apart from a slight discoloration at one end, which I was able to remove with polish, it's a great buy."
3,Creates a Breeze,"Nice little 2 setting usb fan that keeps me Somewhat cool at work and looks cool as wellIf you are going to use this somewhere where it gets Really hot you should get a different fan, this fan creates a Breeze not wind"
5,memories,great memories from these DVDs'. the color and clarity are much better than I remember than when I was a kid.
2,interesting,"This book was interesting reading if you think Jefferson's wall of separation phrase was meant to be one-sided (if there could ever be such a thing). For the true meaning of Jefferson's phrase, read Justice Hugo Black's opinion in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1"
5,Best deal I could find right now....,"Yes, it is a bit misleading because the link directs you to a one filter option, but they do have 3 and 6 filter packs. I bought a 6 pack for $50, and I searched the internet for ""Filter America Coupon Codes"" and found one that got me free shipping, so I only paid $8.33 per filter. Much less than the $15 per filter at Amazon."
5,A Call to action,"It is time to clean up our financial situations and and apply this prophectic call to action which is presented in this masterpiece. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Holy Spirit is saying through this man of God. This could be the final call. A must read if you are serious about building and sowing into the kingdom of God as well as blessing your personal life."
1,How NOT to do Madrid,"First and foremost, this book states that the Madrid Metro is ""safe"". This is not true for foreign males! The central part of the Metro (near the art museums and the city center) is rife with pick-pockets. We caught 1 attempt each day, or first 3 days there. The perpetrators were not, as some claim, ""South Americans"".Many restaurants listed are gone. All prices in the book are quoted in pisitas, which is annoying now that everything is in Euros.The maps are barely useful, being rather too small to read street names easily.I have enjoyed other Lonley Planet Guides very much, but this one is a real stinker."
2,Many inaccurate info,"I have been reading the last 3 editions of Lonely Planet Madrid and it contains tons of innaccurate information over and over.As in Spain one can not fine a lot of Australian wines, they draw the conclusion that ""Spaniards do not take leaps into the unknown""It is like everytime they make a new edition the stay 2 days in Madrid and take everything of the last edition, fading Madrid's feeling, culture, way of life and thinking.Photography is also awful but this is just my opinion."
2,Dubroom Review,"The Mad Professor is one of the best known Dub Mixers from the United Kingdom. On his own Ariwa Label he has released numerous weird dub mixes. He has mixed for Massive Attack, and numerous UK based reggae artists. Using digital equipment, his sound differs from that of the older Jamaican Roots Dub as we know it from King Tubby and more. Mad Professor can be considered as the link between Jamaican dub producers and the newer generation UK Dubcreators (Alpha and Omega, Jah Warrior, Mixman etc). On Black Liberation Dub, he uses an interesting mix of old and new skool Dub techniques. You hear the phaser as well as the newer sound effects as we can find them in samplers and so on. From this technical point of view, I think this album is interesting to study. If you like a combination of the old and the new, this album is for you also. It has computer drums, but also real musicians as well. 12 Very psychedelic tracks mixed in such a way, only the Mad Professor can do this."
3,Don't recommend for young children,"I bought this for my one year old, knowing that it was not made for kids quite his age. He loves any video with animals, and I assumed he would understand it more the older he grew. The vocabulary is rediculous. So much so, that even adults would think it was too much. It's almost as if they go out of their way to make it more difficult to understand. I really like that they made it educational, but in my opinion, it's overkill."
2,Not Impressed.,"Canvas Cathedral read like a doctoral thesis that got way out of hand. Granted it is a historical look at evangelism, but every ten paragraphs mentions how Graham ""fits the mold and makes it better."" It almost reads like, ""I like Billy, you should too!"" One must doubt the professionality of the book, simply because he frequently refers to Graham as ""Billy."" Something that should be avoided in an ""objective"" analysis.On the Brighter side, this is an excellent analysis of an anglo-protestant world-view of history."
4,"...and now, really believe in Bill Evans...","What this pianist does with improvising is nothing short of phenomenal. And he seems to inspire his ccohorts on bass and percussion to new heights of subtle background and solo performance as well...A real gem of cool jazz, without any taint of boring""elevator music""..."
3,I seldom give a Bill Evans album 3 stars...here's why,"I am a died-in-the-wool Bill Evans lover. I have at least a dozen of his albums, but I could very easily do without this one. This is far and away the weakest Evans album I've ever listened to. On top of that it is not very long, having been ""fleshed out"" as it were by three ""bonus tracks"" which are not very good.The B minor piece is very nice. Must Believe in Spring is OK but the extended bass solo is irritating. Gary's Theme is also very nice. The piece for Bill's brother, Harry, is OK but again the bass intrudes. Peacocks is like its two predecessors nice. Sometime Ago again presents us with a too strong bass line. MASH is just not jazz material and I skip it when I listen to the CD. That leaves the three bonus tracks which I've already judged.Some Evans fans will disagree with me which is fine. What I love about the Master is his early stuff, and this isn't like those."
4,Tutti intenditori,"Estremamente orecchiabile anche al primo ascolto, questo e' uno di quei dischi di jazz che fanno sentire chiunque un amante del genere ed un esperto intenditore (io, profano, ne sono un esempio). Nonostante la tristezza che trasmette in certi passaggi e' comunque un jazz molto positivo e sempre coinvolgente. E' senz'altro un disco da comprare."
3,great CD with a busted case,"Great CD that came unscathed and on time, but the case was busted! The teeth that hold the CD in are all brojen off, so the CD slides ariound all willy nilly. oh well"
5,Eggceptional,"EggsWhat a FIND! Who knew there was so much to know about eggs? More than an encyclopedia of knowledge, this book divides the product into types of eggs, egg facts, methods for preparing eggs, and recipes that here-to-fore could only have been appreciated by the European elite. In addition, it is beautifully laid out with spectacular pictures -- ALWAYS A PLUS! A must have for any aspiring cook and every kitchen maven."
3,Advanced,"I'm a 20 year old male, and I like to cook. I bought this book because eggs are cheap and they taste good, but for many recipes in the book I don't know what some of the ingredients are.pros: shows how to make omelettes, crepes, and souffles.cons: little details that the author says are neccesary.if you are going to cook something out of the book look in it ahead of time to see what little things it requires."
2,too french for me,"I did not realize this was written by a master of french cooking. so it was a disaponitment for me, I have three chickens and needed the 101 rescipes for the home chicken owner.It is very french and I am not fond of french cooking, nice pics and i did learn one trick to try on sacrambled egges."
3,Hard to find knowledge,"The info is presented in a fairly easy to follow step-by-step guide. If you are a student architect or technical illustrator who still values traditional media and genuine knowledge this book will benefit you. If you are an illustrator or sequential artist there are better books for you.Also, the copy that I received is little more than photocopies of the original book and not bound very well at all."
1,"Great material, cheap quality",This book seems to cover the material very well. I say it seems to because the copy I received is a cheap xerox and it was immediately apparent that it wasn't going to hold up to repeated use. After browsing through it once the covers had already started to split and I had to return it. I expect better for $83.00.
5,Kick 'bottom' (ahem) guitar work,"I first found Jim Henry when I saw him tour with Tracy Grammer. I was impressed but I wondered what he would sound like without Tracy's vocals and violin in the mix. We'll it is different but man the guy knows what to do with a guitar. He plays kind of a mix of folk, blues, and country. This CD he did with Brooks Williams brings out the best in both artist. If you want to hear some really fine guitar work you can stop right here. I would give anything to see these guys play this stuff live."
5,book,"This book was a diamond in the rough...even my husband, who is NOT a reader, greatly appreciated this book and all it had to offer, not just for our children, but our family as well. Awesome shopping experience with this seller."
3,Good book,I read the book many years ago and it stuck in my memory - enough that tracked it down again (yeah for amazon searchs) and bought the whole set. I found the type to be a bit small which made it a little uncomfortable when reading for many hours in one sitting. It is a good adventure with strong female characters.
2,AKA MAGIC SAM? KEEP IT THAT WAY...BAD R.T. CD,"THIS IS ONE OF MY WORST SLIDE GUITAR CDS. IT'S ALL INSTUMENTAL. AND, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE 18 TRACKS SHOW GOOD SLIDE PERFORMANCE, ON THE WHOLE IT'S FAR FROM RON THOMPSON'S BEST WORK. REAL FAR. I HAVE SOME OTHER RON THOMPSON CDS...""JUST LIKE A DEVIL"" IS ONE. IT'S REAL GOOD STUFF. BUT THIS ONE....WELL, I READ THAT HE WOULDN'T EVEN AUTOGRAPH THIS CD. I ALSO READ THAT IT WAS ""UNAUTHORIZED"" BY HIM. HERE'S A GOOD TIP FOR NEW AND UPCOMING ARTISTS: IF DON'T WANT SOMETHING YOU CREATE TO END UP IN THE PUBLIC'S EYE (OR EAR)LATER ON IN LIFE....DON'T CREATE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WANT TO REALLY DIG RON THOMPSON'S ARTISTRY? BUY ""JUST LIKE A DEVIL"". THAT....YOU'LL DIG. JERSEY SLIM"
2,It wasn't about education,"I wish I could have given this book more stars. I admire Chomsky on many different levels and I was very excited to see this book. I am a teacher as is my husband and we feel there are a lot of anti-teacher, anti-public education, anti-students, etc. attitudes facing us, and we feel many are instigated by the corporate attack on the U.S. We thought, ""Great! If there is anyone who can break these issues down and do them justice, it's Chomsky."" Unfortunately, like the previous reviews stated, he relied on what he knows best which, as always, is well-argued and very peruasive. Yet, education in the U.S. didn't really fit into the big picture. We are disappointed that we bought a book that we have read before (a pastiche of earlier books). I am very let down that there was no exploration of the current state of education. Any analysis of U.S. education would have been nice. The title is deceptive and I am hurt that he didn't write about an issue that hits close to home for me."
5,"WOW! The future of pop music, right here, right now!","This is a kick *** album from an outstanding band. Why they aren't playing 10,000 seat arenas is beyond my comprehension. The musicians are excellent and the songs make you want to jump up, shake your thang and sing along."
5,#1 recommended gift to new parents!,"I found this book to be invaluable! I first discovered this book almost 20 yrs. ago with my firstborn. The fact that Dr. Neifert was not only a pediatrician, but also a mom (of 5!) was appealining in and of itself. But the fact that she could provide information/advice both professionally AND personally sold me on it. I referenced this book on more than a few occasions, and found the information to be absolutely dead on! I recommend and have recommended this book to EVERY parent or parent-to-be! Her advice and/or personal experience(s) have NEVER failed me. I was able to care for my children and on several other occasions, able to diagnose their condition(s), usually before they even saw their own pediatrician (and her advice was ALWAYS exactly what the doctor ordered)! Dr. Neifert NEVER let me down and I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
1,false picture,The spouts in the picture are not included. This is a terrible and false product listing. Buyer beware. word one two three
2,Didnt fit,I have what I believe is a standard plastic gas can. I bought this as a replacement cap because I lost mine. The yellow cap was too small.
5,GREAT FOR SPARE,NEEDED THE WASHER PART MAINLY BUT THE CAP ALSO FITS MIDWEST CANS TO. DOES NOT WORK ON BRIGGS AND STRATTON CANS.THE WASHER HOWEVER WILL WORK.
3,Careful,"I had a clear plastic version of this gun, the barrel and handle slid off...I'm not sure if the same will happen for this one, seeing that its 10 dollars more."
2,Product received not as advetised,"I received this toy 2 days ago and was dismayed. The advertised product was M47 A2 with the description of all the parts, instead, I received a M47 A1, (on top of the box was a small strip white lable that says ""without flash light and the laser aim"".) Really, the toy came without flash light, laser aim, and speed loader! This gun is a pain without the speed loader! I could have returned it, but I realised these part were missing only I unpacked it."
2,My review,"ok, when i got the gun, from reading the previous reviews i was excited. But when i first started playing with it i got powned. If my target was wearing any protective clothing, it did no dammage what so ever. Also, for this to be even any good, you have to buy a speedloader( the one they give u is bad), and the clip they give you, you use it way to quick. I would recomend if you are actually considering getting this gun to either buy multiple clips, or a clip that holds alot of bullets. All and all if you are looking for a good shot gun just bye a more expensive one because with the accesories you have to buy to make the gun ok it would cost just the same as a regular gun."
3,Risk 2210 A.D.,I gave this as a gift and assume it was good. I haven't heard anything negative about it so am happy with my choice
5,Great,This is a great jersey and I recieved a great amout of complinments at school. It is very comfortable shows great spirit towards my favorite team!
3,The Cold Snows Of A Dream,"This book is wonderful in its conveying of a dreamy feeling of winterland lostness. Other than that, I'm not exactly sure what to make of it. And perhaps this is the point. The novelette is filtered through the mind of a protagonist who, aside from an abiding interest in music, admits that he is losing his memory and, ergo, his mind. One finishes the book in the sort of way one, oddly, finishes an Emily Dickinson poem, deeply touched, but not exactly sure of the meaning-Or, in this case, if, truth be known, there is one.I find myself returning to the Wittgenstein citation that prefaces Soucy's book. To paraphrase: How do we know that what we are remembering is the past?.....Or, one would like to add, that what we are reading has meaning?"
3,This book left me totally baffled.,"On the back cover, under the title ""Praise for the French edition of Atonement,"" a quote from Voir states: ""... takes you through a thick fog and finishes by immersing you in it fully."" Then realize that you are going to read that book in translation. Easy to read, but difficult to understand. The blending of fantasy and reality is so complete I could not distinguish between them. May require a few rereadings, but is it worth it?"
2,"Hans Orberg, Grammatica Latina","While this 32-page book (or booklet) is handy for reference purposes, it is much less than what I expected and rather disappointing, especially when compared to Orberg's two Latin readers, which are excellent."
2,not for belivers,"As a Christian, I was offended by the way the speakers just stated that many things that I belive to be true were not. For example, one stated that the four books of the Gospel were not written by Matthew, Luke, Mark and John. That they were written but anonymous people who made them up just to convert people to their new religion, who do they think they are!!"
5,BUY IT ELSEWHERE,"Beautiful mug, artifully packaged as a gift. But not really available here. Never ships. Don't waste your time. If you want multiple selections with immediate shipping try Colorful Critters or My Three Cats."
4,Shaka's Enlightened best,Having seen Shaka Live at the controls it is no wander he has captured the spirit of a live dancehall in this CD. He is the master of Reggae music played live his natural DJ skills at the mike or not equalled in my opinion. Its just such a shame he does not include the siren and other sound effects that make his brand of dub unique. Its also a shame that that the CD is not available to ship internationally via Amazon.com
3,Bad Video and Sound Quality (like VHS)... A lot of jumps !!,The video and sound quality are VHS quality. The sound is just Stereo. Doesn't have a narrator for the video secuence.
3,Disappointed,Klein's Natural's Dried Cranberries as described do not mention sugar as an ingredient. For this reason I purchased a six-pack box only to discover upon reading the list of ingredients on the bottom of a container that sugar was listed second. As one who needs to watch my sugar intake I find this disappointing.
4,Try It!,"Very Hard and challenging game, but very fun! The multiplayer is very fun in both the main game and the mini-games, which can support up to four players. It's a great game to try for cheap!"
3,"Vaguely fun, but its amateur beginnings show through","There's some interesting gameplay elements in there, as well as some genuinely funny humor (e.g. if you turn the gore off, enemies spew forth flowers instead blood), but the gameplay gets repetitive awfully quickly, and the choppy animations don't help the situation. Overall, despite the budget price, I would steer clear of this title and try instead the richer and far more polished Contra or Metal Slug series. I'm trading it in and doing just that."
2,OH NOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,DO NOT BYE THIS GAME IT IS BAD REALY BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]\liek teh grafiks tey are rilly bad. dey r not 3d.The storie is a thing where you haf to be a alien and kuill peopel. It's BLOODLUST. It reminds me of pokeman (or yo-gioh).
1,This should not be a children's book,"I was completely surprised to see the horrible use of wording when it came to the reproduction pages in this book. Tapping her in all the right places, multiple females to chose from, leaving his sperm sack...the list goes on. Not at all what I want my first grader reading. Spiders are not romantic. The language it uses in the reproduction pages wipes out all of the other useful information in the book. SO disappointed that anyone would think this was an appropriate book for an elementary school library. I will do what I can to make sure it does not stay on the shelf at our library. If we don't look out for our kids...who will?"
1,Inappropriate!,"My 6 year old daughter brought this book home from her school library. The book depicts actual behavior of tarantulas, however wording used when describing reproduction is completely inappropriate for a children's book, no matter how accurate it is. I can't imagine even an older child reading this as I'm sure it would spark questions. I am all for teaching our children about the birds and the bees, however with better usage of terms and descriptives. The reproduction of the tarantula covers two pages and is completely sexual in nature...with wording and phrases used that are too mature for any child to read."
2,This book will be out of date the day you buy it,"Alvarez was obviously in it for the money. As others have mentioned, there are whole lines of Transformers missing and some toys are incorrectly transformed. Just looking at the boring cover photo, you can tell that there wasn't a whole lot of time or thought devoted to the non-monetary portions of this book.Jose seems to only care about what they're worth. ...but that's not even reason enough to get the book since the prices are already out of date. The fact that he's considered ""an expert"" has already started to become a joke in the Transformers community. ...and that's what this book is: a joke."
2,"A fun stroll down memory line, but little help to collectors","""The Unofficial Guide to Transformers"" is a fun book for toy nostalgists, but it is too incomplete to assist a collecting enthusiast."
4,Well worth the wait,I think the book was great! I have a huge collection myself and love to see a book as well written and pictured as this one is. Im glad to see that the Transformers are finally getting their respect. Great book Rick A++++++++++
1,Buy this if you're desperate,"Transformers expert? What a joke, this guy doesn' even know how to correctly transform Bruticus. Overall the pictures were semi informative, the dialog was cheesy, and what's the point of a price guide. I expected from a ""guide"" pictures of all the toys, correctly transformed with all accessories. Instead many items are incomplete and some nobody took enough time to transform correctly or even pose. Also, there are many items missing including pretty much the entire action master line, most powermasters, and most pretenders. Unfortunately it is the best book currently avaliable."
2,It's disappointing that this is the 1st book on Transformers,"As a long time collector of these toys, I was excited that finally, a book about Transformers was being released. What a disappointment. This book is abound with lots of pictures of toys that aren't even that well kept, let alone fun to look at (blue backgrounds? Is that the best you could do?). I guess I was expecting too much. I personally have toys that are related to the Transformers that I consider key to the history of the toy line, yet were somehow not mentioned in this book. Unfortunately, there is little mention of the television show, and this cuts severely into the importance of these toys. All this being said, the book simply isn't well written. Typos and poor grammar aside, this book could have been much more entertaining with a more seasoned writer. If you're looking for anything more than a photo record of most of Transformers available in the U.S., pass on this one."
3,Disappointing.,"This book is flooded with amatuerish writing, corny jokes and lots of pointless prices. I'm not looking forward to story reviews, etc. but at this price, the writer should at least include pictures of all weapons, accessories, instructions and tech specs. I'm very disappointed with the effort. I won't call it a waste of money, but I do feel shortchangedby the poor quality. Seriously, if I've his collection, I could have done something similar, if not better.If you don't mind not reading the words, I suggest you get Transformations: Generations. The pics are superb and they showed all weapons, too. No box, tech specs or instructions, but the presentation is much more professional, and the pictures are definitely of a higher standard.Buy this book only if you're a hardcore TF fan, flipped through it once and then forget about it."
2,Transformers Book: An excuse to show off poor colections?,"I was certainly disappointed with the contect of this book. Although there were a few choice peices presented by Dan Hodgkinson(sp?), overall most of the toys were satisfactory at best. An authority on Transformers? Hardly! This guy gave only brief overveiws of toys with a rich history. The information in this book could be learned on the net in about 10 seconds. Just a reference for weaponless robots. All one would need as a substitute would be any transformers wishlist. Kept my attention for about 15 minutes-ponzip"
1,Unreliable,"I went to sell my collection and when I asked for the prices that this book quoted, each store I went to laughed at me for relying on this book to help me sell my collection. Don't go by this book."
1,This is a collector's review!,"This book is a nice pictorial history of Transformers, the best toy line ever, but falls very short as a collectors guide! It does not show all weapons, accessories, instructions, variations, and even ALL transformers. Rather disappointing. I have found HOWEVER a book that DOES have pictures of every weapon, accessory and variation out there...."
4,Its just a nice book that is god to have around.,"There is not much to say but that the book is a good guide to Transformers. With all the pictures, and breif summarys of the that years line, you get a great overveiw. Any way how many Transformer books are out there? none really. This is just a good book for any Transformer to have."
3,Relevance of Ramos' book for IT SOX professionals,"The fact that section 404 doesn't go beyond a high level statement about ""internal controls"" means that IT SOX audits are making it up as they go. There is a desparate need for more detailed, authoritative guidance in this area. Unfortunately, though Ramos' book makes a contribution to the general audit literature around Sarbanes-Oxley, it does not advance things for the IT professional. If you are this kind of person, I recommend not buying this book and instead continuing to rely on the resources available on the web, mostly downloadable for free, such as the IT Governance Institute's ""IT Control Objectives for Sarbanes-Oxley""."
2,Great for one-page junk mail - not for letters.,"The machine folds well, but spits the pages all over the place. I called the manufacturer and they were especially unhelpful. Their response was, ""Yeah, it won't keep the pages in order. You need a different machine for that.""I guess if you're sending one identical page to people and have already addressed the envelopes, this will work. Otherwise it is useless."
1,unreliable,"Too hard to set folds and once the machine jams, it is a killer to clear. You can't put on many sheets at once. Not a machine that our office can rely on; chews up too many sheets."
3,Folding machine,"It was already set up for the z-fold, which was nice. Must be VERY careful or you can jam it - if so, most likely you will have to tear the machine apart to get the jam out and some of the papers will be destroyed. When it is working properly, the folded items may get out of order in the out stack. I think a lot of this is getting used to the machine and what you should & shouldn't do regarding stack of papers, etc."
2,"ok, but makes you want to hear the real thing","Ok for baby, although I'm not sure what developmental psychologists would say. ;)Left me wanting to hear the real songs; this version just doesn't have the highs and lows that PF delivers."
1,Disappointed,"I was really mad that i spent money on this. I should've returned it. The songs all sound the same and the instrament used on the cd is annoying and not soothing at all. i don't recoment this, your baby wont wanna go to sleep to it."
1,Disgusting,"OMG! Honestly this is the most insipid piece of crap I've ever heard in my 56 years short of Pat Boone shred R&B! There's more but...never mind. All of this garbage, and it's ""ilk"", needs to be collected and then burned in big bon fires at some kind of ""free the artist of mindless and disgusting exploitation festival!"""
3,Additional Parts Needed !!!,"You need to buy an additional item to use this.The text says ""This top attaches to the windshield with a special channel ..."" but fails to say you need to buy the special channel.Apart from that, it seems like a great top. I just fitted mine and it went on easy."
3,IMPORTANT: This item likely requires one more part in order to fit your Jeep,"If you do not already have a Windshield Channel in place (and it's highly unlikely that you do), then do not order this part without also ordering the Bestop 51238-01 Black Windshield Channel. This extra piece is about $35 right now on Amazon, so factor that into your cost calculations.I can tell you that other than missing the Windshield Channel, this product is very tough and solidly built. I did, however, return mine because a half-bikini top (to me) isn't worth the $90+ that the two pieces together cost in order to make this work."
1,Biased,"In the guise of objective social science Inglis has written a one-sided diatribe that makes no attempt at presenting a fair and balenced analysis. He refers to Catholics as having ""silenced, repressed egos"" and as being led around and virtually enslved by a closed totalitarian institutional structure. Anyone who knows real catholics couldn't possibily describe them that way. They certainly have exeerted a lot of influence on the world (both good and bad) for being such timid people who are afraid to express themselves or act in accord with their consciences.On the other hand this book will have great appeal to the conspiracy minded, especially as it's biases are hidden beneath the veneer of objective social science."
2,Samarai Jack currently the adventure we lack.,"Samarai Jack is cool with his Sakai mode windmill attacks.But he slashes many bugs, and free the green captives. I findthe game needing Sage stage levels. It is fun, but there's gottabe more to the game than destroying aku's giant statue. I wantto explore the world hub saved by his animated travels.The flame sword rocks, and I hear there are certain cheatswhere he attains the Ice Blade. So far I don't know how to play it."
2,Over the top.,"I read this because of all the good reviews, but I found it sadly lacking. If you like constant Jason Borne type action you will probably like this. But to me the author was just trying to impress you with his knowledge of all the various vehicles he threw at us and the fact that an unbelievable heroine could handle them all! (Many authors do this. They research something for their book and then try to impress-read bore you-with all the detail so they can say look at all the research I did!) I would not have been surprised if they had pursued the chase on roller skates, snow mobiles, and water skis. His 15 year old female was also unbelievable. The male characters were rather shallow as was the plot."
5,Thriling Book!,"This turned out to be a thrilling book. Sara Hackett id a race car driver. She and her husband Clay are raising her neice Kelly Hackett. They are locked in a custody battle with the neice's grandmother Estelle. Unknown to SaraClay has a girlfriend who is pregnant. He also has a plan to kidnap Kelly and the two kids of Cyril Radoshaw andcollect a huge ransom. He teams up with his fellow policeman Jerry and they pull thekidnappings off. They miss theRadoshaw son but end up with Kelly and Paige Radoshaw. They have two hired goons who do their dirty work,Rice Sibley and Guthrie Dunn. Sara is framed for the murder of Cyril Radoshaw and her house is burned down. Meanwhile she escapes and her dear friend Dottie begin hunting for the kidnapped children. This turns into a wild chase all over the California state. They meet several interesting and helpful characters on their hunt for the kidnappedchildren. This book is action packed from start to finish. Be sure to read it."
4,Pretty flower Lights,"They light up decent, float well.. what can I say, they are cute and the price was right.Only con would be they don't use rechargable batteries and aren't solar, but I'm sure the batteries are cheap enough. Adds a nice atmosphere to my pond without being gawdy.Think 'mood light' and you'll be a satisifed customer. I would definitely buy them again"
4,Adorable but Tedious,"These pond lights are incredibly cute. They don't look realistic, but they're still fun to watch float around in your pond. They light up, and the colors change! The only issue is that you have to press a button to make the lights turn on, and they only remain on for one hour. They would have been better had they been solar powered, but overall a delightful product."
4,A very good book. I recomend it.,"This is a good book about elves and humans in the present and past. There are 6 short stories each approx. 50 pages long. Being very well written, this book introduces you to the characterd world of acient and present earth."
3,More like 2.5 stars,"The stories taking place in the past are wonderful and well written. They're what I loved about Strands of Starlight. The stories taking place in the present seem rushed and undeveloped. It does give some background on the characters in Strands of Sunlight, but its not enough. I really wish Gael would go back to the world she created in Starlight. Varden, Terril, Mirya, Talla...I want to know more about them, not these new elves. I thought Spires of Spirit, with short stories, would give her the perfect opportunity to do this, but she doesn't. She just puts in old stuff about characters most people probably don't care about."
2,Strands Review,"Gael Baudino created a magical and intriguing world with the first novel, ""Strands of Starlight,"" a book which ranks among my favorites of all time. Eagerly, I awaited each succeeding novel, but with time I didn't bother and was soon disappointed. Baudino left the world she created and left behind well-loved characters. Readers are left wondering and wallowing in stories which are well written, but ill-conceived"
5,A Real Sweetheart,"Anyone who has ever known how affectionate black cats are will be thrilled to have this Ty Heiress cat that seems to cuddle next to you as soon as you pick it up. Soft and cuddly, made of durable material with no dangerous parts to harm small children, this little sweetheart is a great gift for anyone, young and young at heart."
4,Heiress the Cat,"This one is fluffy and soft. Despite that it looks black, it actually dark brown. It reminds me a lot of the new Pinkie cat of the Beanie Baby line. Not for rough kids. Great for cat lovers or Beanie Baby collector."
1,What are we teaching our children?,"This book makes you want to go out and buy up the many volumes by the greats of children's poetry (because it pales in comparison). The works of such luminaries as Dr. Seuss, Jack Prelutsky, Judith Viorst, or Shel Silverstein are clever, upbeat (and most of all) fun! On the other hand, this book is negative in tone, mean in spirit, and panders to the basest instincts of a first grader. If you read this book to your child, you'll have to wash out your own mouth with soap."
1,A book for Dummies and Suckers,oh well as the name suggests this book is really for dummies. i say it is a dumb book. it throws a lot of things at you.then leaves you with so very little to even go on with. And the java chapters in the book are definitely not enough for any serious reading.the CD-ROM contains too many software installations that dont even make any sense to me. good thing this book is cheap. I would have been really mad....( i bought a used copy of it)i will be selling mine soon.
4,Liked It!,"This type of album concept style always worries me.It seems like the originals are usually MUCH better than the ""tributes"". However I really found myself enjoying the varying styles of these singers. JUICE NEWTON sounds fantastic, and it's great to hear her again. I even liked some of the unknown vocalists like Kacee and Janelle Sandler.The sound clips do NOT do this album justice! It's a good effort and if you're a country music fan you'll like it."
3,bonnie bramlett,"The great Bonnie Bramlett of Delaney & Bonnie. Their first album they were backed up the MG's. Their live album had Eric Clapton on lead and Dave Mason on rhythm. They helped Clapton on his ""and Friends"" album.Delaney was one of the Shindogs on the Shindig TV show along with Leon Russel,Billy Preston and James Burton"
4,cold dub platter,"Mad Professor's take on dub is very interesting. all the standard dub elements are firmy in place, the echoing drums, the plodding basslines, and reverb by the gallons; but where he differs from many of his dub contemporaries is his robotic sense of production and flow. it's very electronic in nature and therefore can come across as rather cold and sterile. personally, i like my dub more warm than cold; but Mad Professor infuses his dubs w/ enough varied ingredients that make Under The Spell Of Dub worthwhile. there's lots of weird trip hop beats on here and plenty of strange choices in production that might drive the rootsy dub listener crazy, but keep an open mind and you'll discover some sonic treats."
3,"The system is great, it just takes a while to learn","If you get this kit, plan on practicing with it for a good hour or two just so you can learn how to place the stencil on your nail. It's not so bad with the other patterns, but the french nails look wrong if you place them incorrectly. Just be patient and plan on taking a little while to figure it out.After you learn, you can do REALLY cool stuff with this kit! I love mine!"
2,Not for trombones,"The metronome function is decent, but could be louder.The tuner cannot register any notes in the bottom third of my tenor trombone range. Whenever I play a low note, the tuner gets utterly confused and becomes unable to register higher notes as well. Definitely don't buy this tuner if you're a low brass player. Perhaps this tuner was meant for string instruments?If you're looking for an excellent tuner, I highly recommend the Boss TU-12H."
2,Almost unuseable,"I got this because I really wanted a tuner with a tone generator, and this one was the only cheap one that I could find with that feature. The tone generator could be louder, but I don't have a big problem with it. The real issue I have is with the tuner function--it just doesn't seem to respond to ANYTHING I play on trombone. The needle moves very slowly and takes a long time to react after I make any adjustments, so I end up over-correcting and doing more harm to my pitch than good. I've noticed that the needle reacts more normally to my voice, so other instruments might be safe, but trombonists should avoid this tuner."
3,Just not loud enough...,"The features on this metronome are very useful, especially the digital tuner. The only problem is the volume. Even when I turn up the volume to the maximum, it's still not loud enough to be heard over my piano-banging!If it were able to produce a louder beat, then I would give it 5 stars..."
2,Slightly disappointing,"I definitely agree with the other reviews that note this metronome's quietness. That is the biggest problem I have with it. Unless I plug my headphones into it, which is not always convenient, I have trouble hearing it ""click"" when I practice, even on piano. Also, because of the power button, I think mine has gone on often and drained my batteries easily. And currently, mine is working at all even though it was about a week ago when I put new batteries in, so I don't know if they were just drained again, or something else is wrong this time."
1,Arrived defective....,"This item arrived with a problem. I couldn't turn the volume up (a dial) in 'metronome' mode without the screen going crazy, giving one more 'beat' then turning itself off; and could not be restarted at the highest volume. I will say that the one beat I did get to hear at the highest volume was pretty weak. The overall feel/look of the product is that it is very cheaply made. And the problem with the volume dial/metro mode confirms this. Had it worked properly, I'd still have been disappointed."
1,Product Quit Working,"I bought this tuner about six months ago, and the metronome function has quit working. The screen starts to flash, then the whole thing shuts off. Also, the case looks poorly fitted and the batteries are very hard to get in and out. I would not buy another one of these."
3,Worked great until it died at 2 years of age,Out of the blue it died after 2 years of use. Other wise it was a decent product. Very annoying that it just died.
4,Great For Tunning Violin and vocal training,"Great tuner I use it for vocal training and to correct pitch in hard passages on violin repertoire and plus is a metronome I used to carry a big metronome to every place I had to go, now i can have with me a small tuner and metronome which is great! The only contra of this product is that its made with cheap plastic and it looks like very easy to broke so you have to be careful with it.."
3,mirriors,they worked good for the first too uses then the one broke and it wont stay on the veciale now
1,Not What I Expected,"The company I work for has been using an older version of Maplinx in order to dress up reports. I looked into upgrading the product, but the company who makes Maplinx no longer supports it. When I saw that Maplinx Express was a much later version that the Maplinx 1.5 we currently use, I assumed that it would have more features. Actually, the Maplinx Express does not allow us to do hardly any of what Maplinx Professional 1994 allows. The ultimate disapointment is the removal of the thematic shading feature, esential to our reports. If you are using an older version of Maplinx and want to upgrade, this is not the product to purchase."
4,Everything you wanted to know about the Kalashnikov rifle,"Long's extensive knowledge of weapon systems in general, and the Kalashnikov system in particular enables him to write a very readable, accurate, and enlightening book. Following the development of Russian weapons in general, Long goes on to describe in usefull detail the Kalashnikov and its many copies, clones, and spin offs. Pictures and diagrams round out this absorbing publication. For the owner of a Kalashnikov, select fire or semi auto, this is book you should have."
3,Beautiful item. Badly shipped!,"The mug itself is beautiful. The artwork is LOVELY.... someone ordered this for me off my wish list... and the big problem with it when it arrived was the whole front of the amazon box was SMASHED in and when I opened the box there was very little packaging to cushion the item. It was REALLY, REALLY poorly packaged. The item itself was smashed a bit. The top of the collector box had a smashy part on it. It made me angry that they couldn't take the time and care to put a little bit more bubble wrap in there so my item didn't get damaged. Don't buy this item from Amazon. They suck at packaging. Buy it used from their used stuff. Maybe someone who isn't amazon can package the item probably. Yeesh."
2,It says it's in stock!,"So why didn't it come? I ordered 3 different Burch mugs from Joann Fabrics, but only two arrived. On the invoice was the 3rd sticker with something scribbled on it that looks like OUX, but really says out. I spoke with Joshua in customer service who said yes, its out of stock. Um, so will it ship later or will I be credited? You'll be credited. So, why hasn't that happened? It would really suck to pay $44 for two mugs!"
5,Must read!!,"A great treatise on a subject that many Americans are ignorant and misinformed about. As with any work, the reader must realize the underlying assumptions and agendas being put forth by the author and their reasonableness and validity. I believe that Otto Scott has done an exceptional job presenting and supporting his argument."
1,racist pulp journalism,"Racist and anti-abolitionist diatribes ruin what could have been an excellent story. The writing is quick-paced, and reads like Tom Clancy,(for good or ill) particularly with his ability to weave several plot threads together and build them towards the inevitable climax at Harper's Ferry. I'm trying to learn more about the secret six, but all this book did was point out how history has been rewritten by the losers - the confederates. Slavery was the fault of John Brown and the people of Boston? I don't think so."
4,Waiting for Volume II,"I love reading books about other people's travels by bicycle. I only wish I had the presence of mind to put down my own trip to Russia ten years ago, while it was still fresh in my mind. This book was totally enjoyable for me, except for one minor point; The road my not have an end, but the book did! I want to know what happened next! Of course I check the website, and get the newsletter but I wish the book had gone on, or that there was a second book, or more. I found it very readable, enjoyable and relaxing. Having some experience with Latino culture, particularly Colombian and Mexican, I found the comparisons between countries fascinating. It my not be my favorite bike travel book, (That honor goes to ""Hey Mom, Can I Ride My Bike Across America?: Five Kids Meet Their Country"".) but it right up there on my short list."
5,A wonderful read,You do Not have to be a cyclist to enjoy this fantastic adventure. I Can't wait for their next addition. It is very uplifing and shows many times the good in our species.
5,Inspiring reading for any (armchair) adventurer traveler,"The Travises are living the dream -- they've found a way to support themselves by writing while spending up to 20 years traveling the world on bikes. Travis, though not a writer by trade, has found his voice early on and spins a yarn that captures the heart. The fact that this couple is still riding, and will be writing about their adventures for years to come, makes the book even more enjoyable -- as you read, you know they're still out there. Anybody looking for inspiration, or a reason to get off their couch and go out somewhere in search of adventure, should read this book."
2,Great bicycle touring books,"I have to agree with other writers who have complained about the quality of the writing. I enjoyed reading it because the subject interests me. If you want to read some excellent books about bicycle touring in other countries try the following: ""Spokesongs"" by Willie Weir, ""The Masked Rider"" by Neil Peart, ""Metal Cowboy"" by Joe Kurmaskie, Odysseus' Last Stand"" by Dave Sumboulis, or the classic ""Miles from Nowhere"" by Barbara Savage. Having commented on the less than stellar writing of this book however I would recommend going to their website where there is a wealth of information about the equipment they have used."
4,Easy does it,"for some one like me who have no experience in scroll sawing, after reading this book, I can start with a simple project."
5,This book definitely makes sense,"This book was the perfect book for me. I am the kind of person who feels intimidated by investing, and doesn't have a real gut feel for how to go about building my nest egg. Having read 'Getting Psyched for Wall Street', I understand the system much better, and feel much more comfortable in making financial decisions about investing. Bernard Murstein uses his psychology background to explain the process of investing, and approaches to the risks associated with investing, in a manner that is very intuitive and easy to understand. He also gave me tools to understand the benefits and drawbacks with investing myself, compared to using a financial advisor. Reading the book, makes me feel like I am in class with Dr. Murstein, and being coached personally by Dr. Murstein. He really is a clear writer who brings a sense of wit and charm to his teaching that makes for a thoroughly enjoyable read!"
4,"Good book, but too short","I really liked this book. I learned a lot about my Treo and what I could do with it. And it spurred me to get deeper into the feature set. But I found the book was too short. I know there is a lot more that can be done with these devices and I would have liked to have seen that in there. That being said, I certainly appreciate the primer on starting to program the Palm. It's a nice quick start into that twisty development world."
1,Waste of money for Treo 700W owners,"This book is all about the outdated Palm operating systemwhich has been replaced by Windows 5.0It offers no help for Windows,just pretends to so You'llbuy it. Save Your money."
5,Wedding,This necklace along with the matching earrings were perfect for my wedding day look. It was classic and elegant and looks great in photos as well as up close. I personally feel that the necklace looks better in person than it even does online and the adjustable length was great so that people of different shapes/sizes can put it on and have it lay perfectly! I am extremely happy with this purchase and only wish I had somewhere else to wear the set! (Maybe for our anniversary!!) I was also very happy with the cost! The set was half that of bridal stores!!
4,Breathtaking!,I bought this necklace as a finishing piece to my ball ensemble and it's breathtaking! I love this necklace!
2,Crystal necklace,My daughter wore this with the matching earrings on her wedding day. They looked great!
5,Beautiful in Person & Perfect for My Wedding,"I DESPERATELY needed a necklace for my wedding and had been looking for WEEKS with no luck. Finally I decided to try and order one online – I preferred to buy one in person in case I didn’t like it I didn’t want to go through the hassle of sending it back for a refund.Anywho, so I was looking for something dainty and simple with enough of a diamond accent to look good in my pictures – this was the PERFECT necklace. It was absolutely beautiful in person. The only issue I had with it was the top part of the diamond accent would twist around a little so my Maid of Honor was constantly fixing it for pictures. None-the-less, I wouldn’t have traded this necklace for another – It was perfect."
4,Quiet Good,I am using this phone from past 3 months & not yet faced any problems. It is working fine.
1,Deception,"The way the original photo of the product was depicted gave me the impresion that an extra (extension) handset was part of the deal. I saw a same product in our local store for $5 dollar less, minus $8.95 shipping cost! Also when I called the dealer for the return of the product (because it is not working) I made responsible for the extra shipping cost for exchange. So, I decided to forget it!"
1,Virtually Unusable,This phone is virtually unusable because the volume cannot be turned up loud enough to hear what the person on the other line is saying.
2,Poor Performance,The reception of the phone rapidly decreased over distance. Clear phone conversations could only be held in the same room as the base unit.
3,Phone works pretty well for the price...,"...everything on the phone works well, the unit is even pretty slick looking in a form follows function sort of way. I must agree with other reviewers who mention the lack of volume coming out of the phone though, you have to hold it to your ear just right to hear the other end of your conversation and even then it could be louder. Do not buy if your hearing is less than 100% or if you live in a noisy house."
1,"Answering machine is nice, but the phone itself is garbage!","The good: The answering machine is nice, with simple features that are easy to use. It's cheap (in price): we didn't want a fancy phone, just something functional.The bad, VERY bad: CHEAP (in headset quality). Like some others noted, it is difficult to hear the person on the other end. There have been occasions where we couldn't hear them at all. There is no way to increase the volume further. Even right next to the receiver you often cannot hear anything.Bottom line: Spend a little bit more and buy another phone....we have to. This one is going in the garbage (would feel guilty selling it at the garage sale...or even giving it away)"
5,The Best,"I have always had Uniden products because they are the most reliable product on the market. I tried other phones by other companies, but I came back to the best of the best. I just upgraded to the 2.4GHz and I am very happy with it. It was easy to set up my phone numbers, date and time etc. Every product on the market should take a lesson from Uniden."
5,Simply amazing!,"If you liked their first album then this one will blow your mind. I was really impressed by this CD, it's so far ahead of anything I've heard from them in the past."
1,Where is shadow?,"I'm suprised at the good reviews for this album. Being from London and following the mo wax scene from the start, I was very disapointed in this release.Dj shadow has no part in this recording, unlike the previous release, so gone are the trademark shadow beats. They have been replaced with unimaginative dance beats. James lavelles new music making partner who sings and seems to be making most of the music on the realease, sounds like any busker standing around the tube stations of London. I would have given it zero stars, but for the track featuring Ian Brown. Fantastic song. Would have fit well on the previous record. Eye for an Eye was pretty good aswell. If you like bland dance music mixed with poor vocals and guitar, you will like this record. If you are a mo wax fan and expecting anything like the previous record, steer well clear."
1,worst album of 2003,"what can i say about this album, other than it just plain SUCKS!.vocals stink. music stinks. and now james lavelle stinks. without having dj shadow to back him up james is lost. this album place more like a dance mix than an album. and you know james lavelle is stuck in a rut when he cant even get the same amout of vocal star power as his first. it feels like a bad B movie sequel. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Good Sleep Aid,"If you ignore claims about boosting testosterone, and get ZMA as a sleep aid, this product is great. The first time I took ZMA I slept like a log, and woke up feeling more rested than normal. That hasn't been the case every time I've used ZMA, but often enough to feel like it is worth using. Improved sleep equals improved muscle recovery, just don't think you're getting a steroid replacement."
4,Maybe it helps?,"Conflicting research out there, but I do seem to sleep better. Not sure about recovery, but the deeper sleep helps (I can't hear my 3 year old in the middle of the night anymore)"
1,Whatever,"Haven't been able to tell any better recovery time or better sleeping with this product like my friend said it would when he recommended it to me. I'm sure the extra magnesium is good for you, but I don't check my testosterone levels daily."
1,Still waiting,i have been taking ZMA for two full weeks now and have not noticed anything. I basically feel no different in any way. Will not try again!!!
2,Don't waste your money on any ZMA products.,"ZMA is a simple blend of Zinc, Magnesium and vitamin B6. You may already be getting these in your multi-vitamin. Unless your deficient in these minerals and vitamin it's not going to help with your testosterone levels. IMO it's a waste of money. Only try this if your looking for deeper sleep."
2,Wast of money,"I've been using enhancing products for a long time. I train weights and cardio 3 times a week for the past 15 yrs or so. Never before I've encountered such a useless product before. I gave it a fair chance and did 2 cycles with 7 days in between. Nothing.If you are looking for a testosterone booster that works, but are not willing to use steroids try Tribulus Terrestris. Two cycles 21 days each 7-8 days of. It really works.Please understand that if you're on your 20's or early 30's none of these products will work. Your testosterone levels are normal. They work well after mid 30's and beyond.ZMA I give you 2 stars. It does help for sleeping, and therefore for recovery I guess. If you are willing to give ZMA a try, you might as well take Cool Aid capsules and hope for better results."
3,didn't notice any improvent,I Don't think it was useful because their were no positive results. I think it was a waste of money
1,Low potency per capsule which is why you have to take 3 capsules at once. Negatively impacted sleep.,"Not too happy to receive this product and see that I have to take three capsules at once (Serving Size = 3 capsules) just to receive the amount indicated on the label. Other ZMA pills require taking just 1 pill.UPDATE: Been a week that I've been taking the suggested dose (three pills) and have decided to switch to just regular zinc monomethionine and stop ZMA as it has been interrupting my sleep (I fall asleep fine but then wake up in the middle of the night and toss and turn for the rest of the night, which I never did before starting ZMA)."
4,Seems to work,"In terms of working as a muscle recovery aid, this seems to work for me. As others as reviewed, it helps me to sleep a bit more soundly as well. All-in-all, I wake up pretty refreshed."
3,"Seems to help a bit, not a miracle worker.","The ZMA in the name is for Zinc-Magnesium-Aspartate, the two minerals being in an easy to assimilate aspartate form. This is a popular product among bodybuilders, as zinc, in particular, is a hormone promoter. I probably already had enough zinc and magnesium in my diet, from other supplements and a well balanced diet, which might explain the limited effect this had for me. Obviously, a person deficient in these two minerals would experience a better effect. What I did find worthwhile about this product is that it seems to help with sound sleep, especially when only a few hours' nap is planned. As is the case with a lot of supplements, best to try this for yourself, and see how it works out. Note that it should not be used with calcium supplements at the same time, as they may negate its effect."
5,"Work night shift, first uninterrupted sleep in months!","I work 11pm-7am shift. I took 2 out of 3 of the pills at 7:30am, and I slept uninterrupted from 8-3. A full 7 hours of sleep uninterrupted! I've tried melatonin and zzzquil and other sleep aids and I always woke up 3-7 times! For the first time I woke up feeling rested! Thank you!"
4,Now Foods ZMA,"ZMA has helped with muscle soreness and recovery after heavy lifting sessions, and I also noticed the energy effects the morning and day after. Overall a good product for the price whether you are a weight lifter or runner/athlete."
4,Puts me to sleep but not sure about other benefits,"This is my first experience using ZMA. These NOW brand ZMA capsules definitely produce a biological effect for me. I'm about halfway through the 180 caps. From my experience so far, two of the capsules put me to sleep like a baby. Three of the capsules put me to sleep but cause me to wake up midway through the night. As for the claimed muscle growth effects, it's impossible to tell at this point if I've made any mass gains. But, improved sleep has to help improve muscle recovery. From my research, the scientific literature seems to indicate that ZMA does not provide substantial muscle gain. I'm not sure if I'll continue to take these tablets after my supply runs out."
3,Nothing bad to say but I didn't find any gain from it.,I got this for a more natural testosterone booster - I cant say if my testosterone was boosted but I felt no benefits from taking the product - may work for someone else though.
5,Energized Throughout the Day,"I just finished my first bottle and the results were positive so I'm ordering more. I didn't notice that it makes me fall asleep easier - I still stay up late like usual. But when I sleep, I seem to have a deeper sleep and I feel well rested in the mornings. The biggest difference I found was that I don't conk out in the middle of the day any more like I used to before taking NOW ZMA. I am more productive at work, and I when I work out I seem to have a little more energy as well. I'm sure this is due to the fact that I'm getting better sleep at night. It seems to also help me get through flu/cold season - I'm usually the first to get sick, but during the last month I was fine even though my kids got sick and I was expecting to catch what they had. I just wish there was a way that I could tell if my testosterone levels actually increased."
3,Didn't work,"I have taken this for about two weeks now. Sadly to say, it hasn't worked for me. It just makes me tired."
5,30 years later,"In 1980 I bought a used piano after 20 years of not having one. Re-building my piano skills was tedious. Then I bought this book. Suddenly I was able to make music. The arrangements were somewhat simple yet not easy.My book is now well worn and needs replacement. I was delighted to see that it was still in print. In fact, I bought two books, one to replace my worn out one and one for a friend who, like me, is trying to rebuild his skills.This book was used at my wedding in 2004 - the Meditation from Thais!"
5,Excellent Update on Cosmology,"In less than 200 pages of friendly, engaging prose, the author succeeds in bringing the reader up-to-date on work in the field of cosmology, in particular, galaxies of the early universe. The views of theorists, as well as those of observational astronomers, are presented clearly. Although some ideas that have been proposed to explain certain observations may seem to be a bit far-fetched and difficult to understand by the non-specialist, once the author has discussed them, he has the kindness of going back to the nuts and bolts of the issue at hand and placing the reader's feet back on familiar ground. This very interesting book will be of particular interest to science buffs with a penchant for astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology."
1,product not as described,"I recieved an email asking me to make this review, an ironic breakdown in the system. The batteries are shipped by a third party and i am convinced they shipped the wrong thing. But since they have no listed telephone and do not reply to a provided ""gmail"" address i suppose the review is simply going to be that these batteries to not fit my panasonic phone despite its exact model being in the list of phones in the advertisment."
3,Innteresting take,"I continue to hunt for a book on London's great fire of 1666 that captures the emotion of what it felt to live in the moment. I have seen some of our current top writers try to capture the emotion of 9/11, but without much success. So, I thought if I could find a book that deals with the fire in this way, then that would give me a clue as how writers dealing with 9/11 should tackle the situation. After reading this book, I need to keep searching. However, this 57 page book presents an interesting take on the connection between the plague of 1665 and the fire the year after that I have not found in any other book on this conflagration. It goes on to explain how the devastating fire would prohibit any future deadly plagues. Along with the basic facts of this historical period, there is also a good map of London showing how the fire spread. This is a fine basic reader on the events, but still offers very little sense of the despair that must have been felt."
1,To general,"I ordered two books, this one I would have to scan the pages into my computer which is a wasted of time. This book was to general is information and I need the information at the next level not the beginers level, I already know much of thier information.I am returning this book. My other choice had all the same information plus the pull out sheets and a CD with all forms so I may use my computer to fill out the forms. It was ""How to form a Nonprofit Corporation in all 50 states"" by Attorney Anthony Mancuso from NOLO. I will be ordering thier ""The CA Nonprofit Corp Kit"" For my use it was to general and was telling me infromation that I had alread found."
5,Amazing Natural Product!,"This is an incredible natural, non-toxic product. I've been using it for a few months now in my Go Green Cleaning Business here in South Florida. You can use it in showers, tubs, sinks, oven, etc... and it's non toxic! Love it!"
5,THE BEST NEW ALBUM OUT THIS CENTURY!,"Anyone who has not bought ""The Opera Band"" by the wonderful new opera band AMICI FOREVER must do it NOW! This album is simply fantastic, beautiful harmonies, beautiful music and performed by beautiful people. I saw them on Good Morning America, Fox and Friends and was instantly blown away.....where have they been hiding?? Well done Amici forever - you are turning the States upside down with this fantastic album. You will be around FOREVER!!"
3,"OK, just not what I thought","I was hooked on the genre by ""East Village Opera Company"", and this group has some similarities, but they're closer to traditional opera by vocal production style, so I didn't appreciate them quite as much. As with most opera singers, their technique is admirable, and it's the sort of thing you'd like, if you liked that sort of thing."
1,A Real Disappointment,"After really enjoying the Amici Forever album, I went shopping for another Amici album and found this one. There really is no comparison between the two. I've tried listening to it several times to see if I'm missing something, but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the Lawrence Welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe. I was very disappointed."
2,A Big Dissappointment!!,"I looked forward to listening to this CD after all the hype on TV, but was very dissapointed in the performance. Words were almost undistinguishable, many just appear to be humming or non-verbal singing. What they are trying to do with classical music is not working for me. One would be better off not buying this CD."
5,Aural Delights,"OK. This is not an album for opera purists. Not all renditions are exactly ""authentic"" classical performances. However, I love the arrangements and harmonies presented by this ensemble of young artists, as well as what I perceive to be the European sensibility of some the more popular numbers. Even the old sure-fire opera clunkers (that everyone loves, anyway) have been given fresh, new life by the arranger here. I liked the ad hype, and I love the album. It's a marketing coup and an aural delight."
4,"Cool, but substantially incomplete","As one of many Vespa books that I own, this book is good. It has a bit of a different slant, with a good history of scooters in the United States, along with the usual collection of photos that you find in any Vespa book. I like how it deals with other scooters, but some aspects of the effort seem a little slipshod, and it includes errors."
3,Errata,The section about the Garden City Scooter Run (aka Victoria Scooter Run) is incorrect. Martin Wales was not the organizer in the late 80's and early 90's. From 1989 to 1992 it was organized by the Vancouver Island Scooter Association and the Tetanus Scooter Club (Mark Milotay & Mark Roberts).
3,"Easy to decorate, hard to cook","Very cute cake, very easy to decorate with little to no decorating skills. I had to let the cake cook about 25 minutes longer and the bottom of the cake was too tough to eat. But I used this as a centerpiece with cupcakes all around it so it was cute as that. You could eat the cupcake top part of the cake just fine."
5,Pan worked great!,I always use wilton products when I bake cakes. They do what they're supposed to do... This cake turned out lovely
3,Are you supposed to hear the tape grinding?,"It works ok but the sound quality isn't as good as I thought it would be, and I can hear the tape grinding away in the tape player."
1,tape din't last,"The chargers are fine. They continue to work well two years later. Unfortunately, the tape quit working about 6 mos after I bought it. I wouldn't reccomend this product."
2,Very Sharp,These are nice quality and look good but they are very sharp and uncomfortable to handle. I agree with the other reviewer about the sharp edges. I would not purchase again.
2,"Nice looking, but not user-friendly","I really like the styling of this knob, and it looks good (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) but I won't be purchasing any more of them for my kitchen, and here's why: THEY'RE SHARP!! Those 4 little corners are really really pointy, not rounded in any way, and it hurts if you don't grab the knob just so. You're probably not going to draw blood, but it's a shame that whoever designed this didn't tweak it to soften those corners. I know if I put them in all over the kitchen, my family would avoid using them and would grab the cabinet doors and get them dirtier.So I'm still looking. Will probably go with a Williamsburg-style egg shaped knob, which doesn't look quite as zippy but will be user-friendly."
2,Cheap Treat for Crabs.,"I bought this at a local pet shop at the recommendation of the store clerk. She said her hermits go crazy for the stuff, but mine don't. They pick out the stuff they like and leave the other stuff.The Good:1) Cheap2) Doesn't go bad in the cage quickly3) Contains three fruits: Apples, cranberries, mangos4) Made in the USAThe Bad:1) Crabbies don't seem to care for the mango chunks very much.2) 50% of this goes uneaten by my crabs.3) Contains three fruits. I feel they could have added banana chips or something else.I am not impressed by this product; It just seems weird they like Frito's more than this product. Save your money."
1,Remakes - or cheap knock offs,"I was looking for the ORIGINAL versions of ""One Night In Bangkok"" by Murray Head, and ""Puttin On The Ritz"" by Falco on the same disc when I came across this CD. I thought it rather odd that the listing didn't show who sang the songs or offer a preview of the music at all ... but I went ahead and bought it.What a mistake. On the very back of the CD case it says ""Performed by Countdown Singers"" !!?!?!?!?!?? What is that? It seems that they took the original songs, and then in some cases put the original vocals over different music - or on the others they have some completely different singer doing the vocals on the songs!This was a waste of my money! If you are looking for the original songs, or even versions done by the ""original"" artist - this isn't what you are looking for. These songs sound like cheap knockoffs that belong on radios in dentist or doctor's offices!"
2,"Good tape, bad experience","Unfortunately, I received this tape at a bachelor's party. After far too many Jack Daniels, I ended up in the bedroom with the stripper who had a bondage tape fetish. One thing led to another, and the wedding was off. I am now the manager for the stripper, pick out her g strings, etc.,etc. It is taking nearly all of her tips for our continuing supply of this tape. I wish I had never seen it."
4,Delivers as promised...,"This was my first time taking a diuretic and I was using it to shed water weight prior to a fitness photoshoot. The Xpel did exactly what it promised - wicked water away from my muscles to ensure definition. The only downside to this product was the insane amount of energy I had after the second dose. It was likely the caffeine (and I'm highly sensitive), but some other gals in my photoshoot (who are not caffeine-sensitive) experienced the same thing, too. If I were to make a recommendation for dosage, I would take the first set of capsules around 6-7AM and the second set NO LATER THAN NOON. The first day I took my second set of capsules around 3PM and sat awake all night staring at the ceiling. I also felt that the Xpel works its ""magic"" after the first two days of taking it - a seven day course seems unnecessary. All in all, a great product that I would buy again to shed water weight for photos or special events!"
1,Incomplete information,"After searching Amazon for a long time I found a duretic suitable for me as silica was not on the list of ingredients. I was sorely dissapointed on receiving Xpel and reading on the label that it did indeed contain Silica, which I am very allergic to. I wish sellers would list ALL the ingredients, I am probaly one of a very few people with this allergy, but it is very important to know what we are buying."
1,DIDNT WORK FOR ME AT ALL,"I use diurex normally- works like a charm.. However this..? Except for the caffeine in it bothering me, it did NOTHING. No thank you. The whole bottle is still in tact after months."
2,does make you feel lighter but scary experience,I feel alittle bit light after drinking these pills but I had a scary experience.. I went to go poop and I was bleeding.. once I stop taking the pills the bleeding stopped.. I don't think I'll do this again .
1,don't get your hopes up,"if you are buying this product and expecting to shed weight without dieting and exercise, you are wasting your money. This product did nothing for me.Maybe if you drank 16 glasses of water, watched your food intake, and exercised in addition to taking this product, it might.....might work....but taking this product alone did nothing for me."
1,NOT WORTH THE BOTTLE IT COMES IN,"This product was ineffective, at best. The only ""result"" I saw was from the caffeine. This aspect is good for those who seek extra energy, but you might as well buy caffeine pills instead. Another effect I experienced was slight dehydration. This let me know the pills were working, but I didn't see the water I carry on my body go anywhere. I just got little headaches and had to drink more water. I was unable to shed any extra pounds when I added this supplement to my diet and exercise regimen. Take Lipo 6."
4,Xpel Review,This product works wonders!!! I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to lose some extra water weight that they have.
2,Other water pills work better,I didn't notice any effect in loss of water weight. I normally take Diurex and those work great. I wouldn't recommend.
1,Did not work for me,"I've had problems with water retention lately and had high hopes that Xpel would help. I took the full dose for several days, and didn't notice any improvement. Very sad."
2,"Good classic game, bulky 3-D","The game of course is great fun, but the 3-D is not worth the extra cost. The kids get distracted by the slides and ladders and don't play the game. They fight over which direction the marble should move (and of course marbles get lost easily). How to count the spaces is not obvious. I would just get the good old classic game if I had it to buy over again."
3,grandma,I just found this product to be a bit dissapointing. My grandson loves Marbles and it took alot to put together and really was not sturdy.
5,Trail Finder Upgraded - No Adobe Reader Required!,"Trails.com recently upgraded their website so that the Adobe Reader is no longer required to view the 30,000 trails! The system is now a one-click simple and fast viewer (no more downloading). Visit the site to see it (free trial offer too). Trail Finder is a great service for any outdoor enthusiast and makes a nice gift to get a friend or family outdoors more."
4,Six for the price of one!,"I really only wanted Space Camp, but I got 5 bonus movies for the same price! What a great deal!"
4,Excellent collection.,"Regardless of the DVD quality, it's still a great collection from the 80s to have on disc at this price."
3,"Slow focus, good price","If there were other options for a 12-24mm lens, I'd rate this one lower. I just returned from a trip taking about 2,000 photos. This is an excellent lens for interiors of large churches, facades and expansive landscapes. But, on my D70 I often could not get it to auto-focus in order to take the shot. I missed a number of great shots because of this. It might be an issue with my camera, but my 28-300mm Tamron had no problems. I do like the ability to pull the focus ring towards the body to enable Manual focus, and that saved some shots - but only after 5-10 seconds of trying to allow the camera to focus itself. Otherwise, no problems to speak of. This lens spec coupled with the 28-300mm would be all I'd recommend if traveling light."
4,Tokina 12-24 Lens & Nikon Speedlight Compatibility,"I found that the performance and build quality of this lens are both excellent - especially for the price. But be aware that there are compatibility issues using the Nikon SB-600 Speedlight (and probably the SB-800). Mounted on my D300, the auto zoom (that sync's the Speedlight zoom to the lens) and the auto focus illuminator (AF-ILL) do not work. Those Speedlight functions do work with my Nikon lenses. The auto focus illumination is important to me. If I had known about this, I probably would have spent the extra money on a Nikon lens."
2,Jack Rudman writes alot of books? Where is expertise?,"Jack seems to write alot in a number of fields. The good part is it is Feb. 1997. The book should be broken out into different subjects with much more debth. Math should have at least five topics and Science is broken out into Earth, Biology, and General. Which test is he preparing us for? I have seen better. The ETS TAG series is a good place to start. I read study guides for a living. I have seen some good Math for middle school books and also one for earth science and biology. These are not my books"

4,A Tennessee Christmas,"Tennessee Ernie Ford was without a doubt one of the great singing voices of the 20th.Century! At his best, he was right up there with Crosby, Jolson, and Sinatra. This 'Christmas' program, culled from his long running TV series has some nice moments, plus some nice guests such as Kate Smith singing a lovely version of 'White Christmas'.Anyone who thinks Tennessee Ernie was just a 'Hillbilly type singer', think again, when it comes to big ballads, this classicly trained singer had the 'big voice', and could deliver the goods! As well as this DVD, there is an excellent one featuring a biography available, which includes another program of 'Spirituals' [as he called them], which is well worth the price alone.There are some very pleasant surprises for anyone wishing to re-discover, or indeed discover for the first time, one of the really great entertainers of the 50""s & 60's."
2,Expectations? Too bad,"I've seen most of Tinto Brass's movies now. He's basically a one-trick pony, but he does that trick well enough that I keep looking for one of his movies that might be good. Black Angel isn't it. Typically, it contains a few erotic scenes and the attempt to create a background for these undermines any other value that the movie might possibly have had. The film's foreign title is Senso '45 and is based on the short story Senso, which you can read about online to find out the plot of this movie. There isn't any message here as far as I can tell except a nihilist one that leaves you thinking the characters are all either shallow and depraved or fools or both. Despite the costumes, there isn't any historical context or drama connected with the war. One extra star for Brass doing his one trick adequately."
5,Long Overdue,"For me, Priscilla Cogan's wonderfully written story encouraged a spiritual sojourn that was long overdue."
4,Warming to the heart!,"I listened to the audio book (2 tapes) as I would drive to work. I was transported during my commute to another world of simplicity, yet complex. Winona has much to teach us all! Thanks so much Priscilla Cogan for this book. Salome Jens is an excellent narrator too!"
5,Winona's Web,"Excellent Reading!!! I laughed, I cried , - I read the book in 48 hours. I couldn't put it down. This book opened my mind to ideas I already knew existed but had never felt in my heart. The emotion was to real - and very fulfiling."
5,Winona's Web: A Novel of Discovery,"I loved this book, and I loved Winona. Started reading it on a Saturday afternoon and finished it early Sunday morning and spent Sunday afternood searching the bookstores for the 2nd of this 3-book series. Winona's Web is definitely for any woman or some type of journey and most of those who are not. Winona is an example of a woman who has found herself and an excellant role model to Meggie, who has not. This book is to be coming out as a movie, and I can hardly wait."
4,Does a lot more than trim laminate....,"I purchased this item to put rounded edges on some homemade benches from a local B&B. I knew that the size of the trimmer and the base options would let me reach the areas a normal router couldn't touch. Six hours later the benches were done, delivered and paid for. The client was ecstatic over the results and gave me another project to work on. I try to purchase tools that can be multi-functional, thus justifying the extra money for the offset and tilt bases. Sure enough I have a new client who wants a counter top cutoff within 3/4"" of the wall, enter the offset base. I like the ergonomics of the Bosch trimmer better but couldn't justify the extra cost. I think some of the reviews I read on the DeWalt are a little harsh concerning base changeovers, I'm no rocket scientist and had no difficulty."
1,DO NOT EVER BUY A REFURBISHED NIKON PRODUCT,"Do not ever buy a refurbished Nikon product. These include problem cameras that were returned by other people for serious repairs. Nikon doesn't even offer the original warranty on refurbished products, but only a 90 day limited warranty. It's not difficult to figure out why.Don't try to save a few bucks, because in the end the savings may be eaten up by the shipping charges sending the refurbished camera back to Nikon for repair - - or worse yet by the repair charges once the shorter warranty expires. It's an important investment. Buy it new."
5,Definitely a favorite,"Without a doubt, Time's Arrow 1 and 2 are a favorite of mine. Part 2 starts the 6th season off with the finale of the Enterprise crew vs. energy-eating vampire aliens. We finally find out why Data's head was found in the cavern in part 1. And of course, it's fun seeing the interaction of our heroes with Mark Twain or Jack London. Plot: After the rest of the senior crew (barring Worf, which is a good thing, since it would have been a challenge to explain to someone about his alien appearance) step through the time portal, they have to track down the nasty alien-vampires and stop them. The humor is great, including Mrs. Carmichael address our dear captain as ""Mr. Pickerd"", Mark Twain's statement of seeing Worf, etc. I very enjoyable episode."
5,Added convenience for a laptop,"Dell 1978U PRX Latitude C/Port II Dock Station PRX Replicator IRThis is a great convenience for my laptop. Not only does it have added features, but it keeps my lap from heating up with the computer on this dock station! Worth getting."
4,Zen Page-a-Day Calendar Review,"I like the Calendar very much. I have the paper edition and get the e-mail version. I save pages from the e-mail version when they speak directly to me.Not every day's saying is appropriate to my life, but those that are provide anticipation as I receive the e-mail or tear off the previous page.In summary, a very worthwhile calendar."
4,Zen Page-A=Day Calendar 2007,so far so good. only on page 5. Love these Page a day calendars. Have had a different one every year for a long time.
4,Lots of fun,The game is a lot of fun. We all have a great time playing it. The only complaint is the spinner doesn't work well. But we had no problems spinning it and re-spinning it without knocking over the tree and my son isn't exactly the gentlest! I think it is the right amount of balance for the object of the game and not easily knocked over as one other reviewer said. We enjoy it but just wish it had a better spinner.
4,Pretty fun!,"Got it in the mail yesterday and the kids love it. You really can't hang a lot of the momkeys when playing with a 3 year old because he doesn't understand distributing the weight, so he keep tipping the tree over. But lots of fun nonetheless."
5,Monkeying Around: Our pre-schooler loves it.,"This is a great game for pre-schoolers who don't quite understand the concept of ""winning"" when it comes to board games. My daughter received this as a gift when she was 3 years old and loved it. Even when she ""loses"" it's fun for her. She's now four and this game continues to be one of her favorites. She better understands the objectives now and actually tries to think out the placement of the monkeys.We've given this game as gifts to other pre-schoolers and get good comments from their parents."
2,Poor Spinner to Play Idea,"The spinner that is attached to the base is a very poor idea. First, it works poorly as a spinner, second and most important, is that it is very important to not move the tree base when the game is about delicate balancing of hanging monkeys. Slight movements, like trying to turn a poorly designed spinner, will many times cause the tree hanger, and all of the monkeys, to drop down."
5,Great!,Thank you so much for this great book! It's so helpful! I'm so glad to have all of this info at my fingertips.
5,A complete guide to home gardening,This free eBook is great to have at hand when questions come up-as they often do. I expect it to become one of my most-used reference books on gardening.
1,Not for the small gardener.,Unless you have acres and a horse to plow them (the method described frequently for soil prep) then this book is not at all helpful.
5,"Great guide, great tips and help!!!",This guide is like listening to your grandparents. It's not a fast read. I' ve spent 60 yrs growing my own dinner and almost everything I've read in it works for here in the Smoky Mtns for gardening. I had zero problems with my Kindle download. For free? Way to many complaints. I highly reccomend it. Old Geezer
2,"Home Vegetable Gardeining: A Complete and Practical Guide to the Planting and Care of All Vegetables, Fruits and Berries Worth","There was not enough information in this book. When they reprinted it, they left out the drawings. This took a lot away from the book."
2,One of the worst casebooks,"This is one of the worst casebooks ever written, although it wont stop the sales because most students do not have a choice of textbooks. The book is poorly edited and leaves out crucial pieces of information (such as which statute is relevant). The book is also in an order that is not conducive to learning the material."
3,"ok, but small display",This item was purchased for my nephew who wanted an alarm clock that projected the time on the ceiling. While that option works just fine the read out on the clock itself is very small and not illuminated so you have to be pretty close to be able to read it. The clock works fine but I would probably look for a larger display next time.
4,All I can say is that it is gone,"All I can say is that it is gone. This book has changed my life, I never thought that I could have my fears just go away. I read How To Expand Your Comfort Zone: Release the Fear That Holds You Back in one night and fears, that have plagued me were gone. This isn't one of those flight by night, phyc. connection or quake remedy. If any one is lock in and can't move forward because of fear this is the book for you."
1,Gary (Bangkok),"I have seldom seen a writer make such poor use of such fantastically rich material. The plot is solid, even potentially fascinating, and the blend of myth, history, culture and imagination is an embarrasment of riches. But technically, Adirex is a poor writer, at least in the English language. His use of dialogue is particularly poor - wooden and stilted. Anyone who ends a phone conversation with ""I've got to go now"" (and he does this on numerous occasions) is struggling. Characterization is equally poor - more like cardboard cutouts with little of the depth you expect from good writing.Reading this book was a very frustrating experience for me. I expected so much and the author certainly had the raw material to deliver. But he simply does not have the technical skills. Perhaps the book's greatest use is as a resource for creative writing classes where teachers demonstrate poor technique and use passages for students to practise improving the poor quality writing."
3,More trouble with publisher than author,"Overall, this and the second volume combined do well to cover the major topics of evolutionary computation. Unfortunately, the IOP (the publisher) is not very good making the books (especially the first volume) available. I used both volumes for a course I teach in evolutionary computation. I completed the course, and most of my students received volume 2, but did not get volume 1 until well after the semester was over.In fairness, things may have changed since this class was taught. I would STRONGLY suggest that anyone interested in the books contact the publisher prior to order to make sure they will be received in a timely manner.The contents of these volumes used to be available free online from the IOP site. They are still on the IOP site, but you now have to pay. Pity."
3,My daughter loves it and that is the important part.,I took this cd out from the library just to test it out before I bought it. My daughter is a year and a half old. At first I was not sure if she cared for it and then she started to sing along to it. So she likes it. I decided to buy it. Yes the songs sound like they are all recordings from the 30's. I am not even sure what year they are made but as long as she likes it I am happy.
1,Too bad the dvd was defective-it is an excellent movie,The Foxes of Harrow is an excellent movie and I could not wait to own it. The dvd was defective in the first shipment. Requested replacement and the dvd had the same defect in the second shipment. I contacted customer service via phone because I had hoped another supplier might send the dvd without defects but was told nothing could be done about it. Very disappointing. It is the first time Amazon.com disappointed me.
2,Won't hold a Charge - Save your money,"I bought a ten pack of these rechargeable aa batteries at Fry's about a year ago. They were fine when I first bought them, however now they won't hold a charge. I've only recharged them twenty times or so. I used to charge all my rechargable batteries at once and then put them in a drawer. I wondered why they would be dead after sitting in the drawer for two to four weeks, then I read that all rechargeables slowly drain voltage every day even if not in use. I thought it might be my charger, however I have three and the chargers I have charge up my other batteries. I've used both trickle chargers and rapid chargers, however they still won't take a charge. I guess I got my moneys worth, since I only paid $1 per battery, however the package says ""rechargable up to 1000 times"". I got 20, which isn't very close to 1000. I've bought other batteries on sale for about the same price and actually come with a warrenty, these don't. I'd buy something else. Good charging."
2,22 out of 24 dead after 17 months,"I held off writing a review on this product until after I had sufficient time to test and use the batteries. I bought them July of 05. It is 17 months later and here's how they stacked up. Five out of the 24 were DOA. Over a twelve month period, one would crop up dead on occasion, eventually winding up with another six batteries unusable. At the sixteen month mark they suddenly started dropping off one by one very quickly. Now it is December 31, 06 and I only have two left that still hold a charge.By contrast, I have a set of batteries I bought from Radio Shack. I considered them cheap and unreliable. I didn't expect them to last long. All of those batteries still hold a charge and work as good as new. In fact, out of all the rechargeable batteries I own, none have failed as rapidly as these have. I will not be buying them again in spite of the low price. Mom always said, you get what you pay for. She was right. These are cheap for a reason."
5,great price and works great,"These batteries work great in the portable audio devices I've tried them in, i.e. mp3 player, cd player, cassette player. They last almost a whole day which is reasonable and they charge up fine in my old NiMH charger."
1,these are either too old or defective,"I thought this was reputable brand and an outstanding price. Unfortunately when I received them I was immediately suspect when I notices stains (leakage?) at the top of some of the cells. I checked one by peeling the plastic label off of it to see if there was cracks but did not find any so maybe it was the glue. I charged them and thought I was good to go. I left for a meeting and planned to shoot some pictures. It immediately indicated low battery. I'll try charging one more time, but I think these batteries they are selling are plain duds. I'll see if they will take them back, I think you should stay clear of this product."
1,Bad Batteries!!,I got this battery a few months ago and they neverwork for me. I don't know if these battery are bador what. They didn't have any power even if Idid a full charge on them.
1,Complete Garbage,"I purchased 12 of these batteries 2 months ago. Of the initial 12, 7 were completely unchargable. The remaining 5 would hold a maximum charge of 800mAh, some as low as 550mAh. I have returned all of these and are purchasing Maha Imedions."
3,Okay for price but can't depend upon,"Till today, I doubt its capacity is really 2000mAH. For serious use, please avoid and choose Energizer or other brand."
3,You get what you pay for.,These things are priced cheap and their performance reflects their price. If you're looking for some cheap rechargeables then they will work for the most part but if you need batteries that last then invest your money in a higher quality battery. I use them in my canon powershot a530 and I need to carry 3 extra sets of batteries to be able to shoot most of the day. Most of my pictures are in the day so the use of flash is minimal and I shoot about 20-30 pics a day.
4,A great price on a good product,"It is true, these batteries are far from perfect. Not all are going to be at 2000 mAh right out of the box, but no set of batteries is going to do that. Most of the problems people have with these probably stem from having junk chargers. If you want a bunch of batteries for a low price, and don't absolutely require megacapacity from each one, these are a good investment."
2,Good deal but closer to 1600 mAh batteries,"I have a charger that is able to measure the capacity. 200 mAh charge and 150 mAh discharge, some of them measure 1300, most were around 1600-1800 mAh. Good value but they are not 2000 mAh batteries."
1,Too many DOA,"I have extensive experience with NiMH AA batteries. These are trash. About 8 of them were 1800 mAH, 8 were less than 600mAH (throw away), and the others in between. I guess, the net cost is about what you would expect from regular brands, but then, what if you don't have the equipment I have? Caveat Emptor."
3,inexpencive batteries,The price of these batteries was very good. So far all but one of the batteries shipped has worked. It seems to take a few charges to get them up to capacity which is what I expected. So far I am pleased. Only time will tell if they hold up to repeated useage.
1,You get what you pay for!,"These batteries are not worth the money, even at around a buck. The don't hold a charge for long compared to other 2000 mAh, and one of the batteries ruptured while charging, ruining my charger. I'm returning this product."
1,Don't buy this product. It is dangerous!,"I bought this item recently, thinking it is cheap. Two of the first four batteries I charged got overheated and exploded. They almost set my house on fire."
2,NO CHARGE - RECHARGEABLE AA BATTERIES,Tried four out of the box on small handheld t.v. - worked for all of 7 min.
3,Useful but you can live without,"The practice pad is nice, and does well the job it was conceived for but it is not that useful. I mean, you cannot learn one kana per day or you won't be able to read Japanese for ages.More useful instead the Kanji-a-day - that I'd recommend."
2,There are better Burma guidebooks,I found this book out of date and difficult to use. Fortunately my travel companion had another Burma guidebook that served us well. Burma is a difficult place to travel in and a thorough guidebook is essential. I would also strongly recommend a local guide. It will make the trip a lot easier.
2,for colonials,"I found this guide heavily padded with literary references, which seemed to take precedence over practical information. It's also way more out of date than it's main rivals, LP and Footprint. Better for historical info related to travel is Gerry Abbot's The Traveller's History of Burma."
5,Cute for Baby Showers,I used this cake pan for a baby shower. The cake was adorable. This is a nice metal cake pan that cleans up easily.
2,The color is not right!!!!,"The sunglass are cool...However, the color is not blue..It is bright purple!!!!!God!!! Cant wear it."
2,Sugarpaste Cake Decorating Techniques,"The Complete Book of Cake Decorating With Sugarpaste by Sylvia Coward is filled with 50 original cake designs and step-by-step instructions for completing the cakes. The techniques encompassed in this book include floodwork (color flow), sugarpaste (rolled fondant), buttercream piping techniques, and pattern transfers.The book includes an introduction that gives basic instruction in using decorating cones (parchment bags), decorating tubes (tips), glass stencils, ribbon work, and flowers (piped and sugarpaste). The final section of the book, and the most valuable for me, was a section of patterns. The author provided patterns for making sugarpaste flowers, floodwork collars, alphabet variations, and embroidery accents."
4,Good for the Price,"This was a great product, but our puppy chewed up part of it if we left it on her for any amount of time. Great product for the price!"
4,Not for a Great Dane...,"These are a quality product, but the X-Large are very tight for 115 pound Great Dane. If your Dane is any bigger, you won't get them straped on. Also, they are difficult to get on, though probably because they are a little too small. They do work well, and have withstood the other dog taking off and chewing them!"
4,Right where they left off,"I agree with the last review - in the sense they started right where they left off. I have also been a Trouble fan for 20+ years. I think the production value is killer in Eric's vocal's...but I dont' hear the harmonizing that is legendary between Rick and Bruce. But still I am very pleased with the release. Any Trouble is good Trouble. My faves are: Going Home, After The Rain, Trouble Maker, If I Had A Reason and The Beginning of Sorrows (much kudo's to Oly for writing it). I also give kudo's to Ride the Sky. Everything else is mild to me.....but dont get me wrong - if you like TROUBLE - you will like the album"
3,borrowing too much from the past,"I'm a die hard fan w/ my fave albums being Psalm9 and the Skull.That being said, Trouble has all but abandoned their doom roots in favor of the Beatles era 60's sound they have grown so fond of. My biggest problem is that two guitar riffs are plagarized from classic rock ""classics"" (now you're messin with a sonofabitch from Nazareth & Immigrant song from Zepplin). they are so blatant even a co-worker who is barely in to music commented on the rip-offs. Not much imagination in this one just alot of rehashed riffs and lyrics. I hoped for another doom metal classic but this is very mediocre. If it wasn't for the Sabbath-like guitar sound this would barely even be a metal release.BTW - Trouble hate that ""white metal"" tag so I don't know who would have submitted that as their band description. They have hardly been a ""Christian"" metal band since Run to the Light. This one is for die-hard hard fans only."
5,Great product!,"I love this product! I wished that I found this product sooner. I have my hair natural in box braids, and not only does it moisturize your hair and condition your scalp, it also helps your hair to grow. I've used this product since June and my hair has grown about 4 inches. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with ethnic hair."
1,What kind of a scam are they running here?,"As a proficient VB/COM developer, I thought this might be a good book to begin learning Java with. Be warned: It is not! It was written over 4 years ago and it completely out of date. The text makes constant references to the accompanying CD, which does not exist. The book honestly looks like a poor quality photocopy. It is clear that this was writen in 1996 and republished in January 1999 with nary a change in content. The book only goes to VB4, which is long gone. Want to learn Java? Buy Beginning Java 2 by Ivor Horton. I am sending this book back."
5,Ring Disk,"This is an incredible product! For those that like to follow the manuscript, the music and the translation of the libretto, this is excellent. I would love to see more of these. I will buy."
4,A Great Resource,"This is a great resource for exploring the Ring operas. Decidedly low tech by 2012 standards but amazing that all of this info (full performance, score, libretto and short articles) fit on one CD-ROM. The hyperlinks work great. Deducted one star because price is a bit high."
5,wonderful,"With text, score and links to leitmotifs and explanations, it is a wonderful way to enjoy the Ring."
2,Good for those of the Christian faith . . .,"While there are probably some good ideas and inspirational messages in this book, I was so distracted and turned off by the constant biblical quotes and references that I didn't get anything out of the book."
2,ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS BOOK NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE,"ALMOST CONSTANT BIBLICAL AND RELIGIOUS MESSAGES. I could not get farther than a few pages. I am sure that for someone looking for a ""voluntary simplicity"" book with this religious slant would give this book 5 stars. But I prefer my books to be WAY more secular. I have nothing against this author and her message, in fact, i OWN the more with less cookbook that she wrote. This book had bible references also but i didnt feel it was too distracting. But I felt like in this book I was gonna read the bible weather i wanted to or not. I dont have alot of money for books and when i buy i need them to be able to be sure that i get what i am buying."
3,Not ready for prime time,"I was struggled whether to give a two or three rating, but settle on 3 because of clear writing. While it is easy to ready, the book serves as an VERY introductory book on the topic.It covers all the major topics/areas in M&A;, however, at a very cursory level. Several topics are treated repeatly without further insight (e.g, who to have on the M&A; team on the buyer or seller side, incentives on different groups to help M&A; be a success).I was looking on a how-to book, but found myself skipping over several pages several times because its elementary and repetitiveness. I end up asking myself whether I am any wiser."
2,these are not authentic,"i assumed, since this was a dover book, that the designs would have been originally published in the 20s and 30s. not so. they are 'interpretations' by an artist born after deco ended and created in the mid-80s.the designs are not horrible, but they're not wonderful, either. there may be one of two that, with tweaking, i might use, but most are pretty ordinary."
3,Photoimpact,"I had this program on a cd when I got my computer so i didn't buy it and i am glad that i got it for free! Well it is kinda hard to understand, but the most part i understand is the part when you can use special tools like transform pictures, do wind and blur effects and alot more effects it is a pretty good program. the onlye reason i give it 3 stars is because i can't figure out how you do anything else realy and that madedit for webpages would be really helpful for my web page!"
4,good use,Angle drill attachment. I was very pleased withthe speed my angle drill was shipped. It is a product that I will get much use of.
1,Very Poor Quality,I used this attachment one time right out of the box and the plastic gear housing cracked wide open. Very cheap plastic is used as the frame and housing for the gear drive. Even though the drive gears and axles are made of metal. I was very disappointed. Home Depot did give me my money back.
1,"A poor choice, don't waste your money.","I needed to drill one hole that required a right angle drive, so I figured that an inexpensive tool could do the job. Well, I was wrong. This item is so poorly made that it won't even get one hole made through a pine board. The key for the Jacob's chuck is so sloppy a fit that the bit can't be tightened down enough and the bit slips. I did not expect much, and I got it. Do not waste your money on this item."
3,"Great handle, but I lost the pin","It's great and very useful, but the proprietary square-head pin that attaches the red grip handle was lost!! I disassembled the unit to fit into my low drawer before storing it.I wish that there was a special bag to store the whole unit, or a grove on the side of the unit to store the handle and the pin."
4,Milescraft 1390 Drill 90,"I am extremely pleased with this right-angle tool. It is well constructed and made drilling through the wall studs a breeze, all at an affordable price. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is beacuase it does not have a keyless chuck - or at least a place to store the key."
1,The Worst,The drivers on the cdrom that came with the unit are corrupt. Emailed Siig for support and waited and waited and waited. They never got back to me. I called and they didn't care. I found other people on forums with the same problems. Lousy tech support. Returned it and bought an Adaptec product.
5,Heartwarming and charming,"This is one of those books that, after picking it up at a friend's house, I had to have. I'm a longtime fan of Tasha Tudor's heartwarming illustrations, and here she does what she does best: animals, children and Christmas. Her daughter Efner, born to the tradition, gives us a charming tale of a little gray cat, lost and abandoned in a blizzard, and the Christmas magic that brings him into the lives of two children. A terrific book for children of any age, or adult cat-lovers like me!"
3,nice book but,"while the story is sweet with adequate but not spectacular illustrations,and includes a gingerbread recipe there is a religious slant to the story. If that is what you are looking for, this is a very pleasant book in which a cat finds a home but if you want a secular holiday tale, ""the Christmas Cat"" has a nativity scene at the end."
3,Beautiful photography,You will get to see yet another side of Mary Summer Rain as you browse this book which contains lots of her own photography - she adds calming verse to her thoughts about the Colorado country she loves so much. Very different from her earlier books - entertaining but not as thought-provoking...
2,Not what I expected,I'm a huge fan but this was way too out there. Not like her past books at all. Loved the cover!
3,Not very comprehensive,"Doesn't offer the breadth and scope of other college review books. Princeton Review much better source. Actually, online sources provide best way to narrow down college choices. Try Princeton Review, College Board and U.S. News and World Report online sources."
3,Not as comprehensive as I thought,"I was told this is ""the Guide"" for prospective college students. I didn't even have all the colleges my son is considering, so I found it less helpful than I thought. There are better sites on the web about college...don't waste your money."
2,Poor coverage of Ohio Universities,"I bought this for my son, who will be leaving the military within the next year. I was disappointed at the number of schools covered, especially in Ohio. It did not cover public Universities such as Kent State or University of Akron. I am still not sure what group of students this book has some use for...."
4,This Book Alone Would Suffice,"If your overachieving child is destined for one of the selected schools in this book, you could probably do enough good (or harm in the eyes of your senior) with the information included in this book.It does not answer every question, but does a heck of a job.It does not have the detail of every campus -- but that is really for you to find by visiting the schools.It has numbers and some interesting insights, and at the price of 1-3 pages per school, that is impressive.If you would like to get just a little bit more, buy Barron's along with this book.If you would like to get much more, do not fret. The bookstores fill their stacks with these types of books annually for the nervous and overly enduldged parents of the overachieving youth of America.If you want cheap old copies of these books, my attic may supply your needs."
3,Started out good...,"I felt like this book started out good but then the two young ""lovers"" just run off together and have sex all the time. That's pretty much it. It lacked a good story line. It had a story line...just not a good one."
4,Instruction Sheet,"I owned one of these tuners for many years. The model is from 1983.Last year, I sold mine (including box). I recently discovered that I still have the instruction sheet. Anyone need it?"
5,A Worthy Addition to Your Gospel Collection,"I have had this CD for many years. Originally, I bought it for the live recordings of Dorothy Love Coates and the Gospel Harmonettes, whom I absolutely adore. Though I have had long enough with it to become acquainted with the very good performances of some of the other groups--the male quartets and the Staples Singers shine!--Dot and the Girls are still my hands-down favorite. The energy, earthiness, and earnestness of their performances make for absolutely enthralling listening. Those days are gone, and so many of the Golden Age artists are, too. The rarity of live classic gospel musical performances is what makes this a CD to have."
1,Only for rookies,"Pavlik wrote a great part of this book in his Palm, as himself said. It must be true, because only by this way somebody can write a book about such an exciting subject with so little intelligent speech.This book it is only a collection of facts and figures for rookies, not for people interested in new media and journalism."
1,Horrible CD Player,"I received this CD Player/ Radio as a birthday present and was very disappointed after listening to it for the first time. The CD player makes a loud spinning sound while standing, using its easel feature. Not only that, but it also stops intermitently while playing a CD in the upright position. I also noticed that the sound almost sounds muffled in the CD mode. The radio portion seems to work fine, but what good is a CD player/ radio when you can't use the CD part? It is meant to be used in the shower, but since I cannot play CD's in it unless the unit is laying flat, then I can't hang it from my shower head and listen to my favorite CD's in the shower. Isn't that the main purpose of a shower CD player/radio? I would not recommend this item to anyone!"
1,"Do not buy this product, spend a little more to get one that works.","The product worked in the shower for 5 days. Now, the power light turns on but no sound comes out. Yes, the volume is up. I'm very upset with amazon since there was already a negative review for this product, stating it did exactly what happened to me, but I thought that amazon would not offer a defunct product. Is it worth the amazon name to sell crap?"
4,A Bargain:At least 3 good movies at a great price,"The 6 movies here are as stated by amazon,and not by the previous reviewer.I've watched4 of the 6,and 3 of these are good to very good. These are the Bridge at Remagen,Beachhead and Mosquito Squadron. I didn't think too much of Ambush Bay,whichseemed to have no story line-other than killing off the group one at a time-untilnearly the very end. If you like WW II movies,this is a good collection at a verygood price."
3,Not Bad!,"These were not the best movies that came out on World War II. The color is good, and they have some good scenes in each movie. Beach Red was not one I liked when it came out, and I did not like it again. Never understood what the director was trying to do. Did not work for me. Rest are B movies. Not a bad price though."
1,One of the strangest picture books I have ever read!,"After checking out Maurice Sendak's ""Where the Wild Things Are"" and reading it for the first time, I could understand why it's considered a classic. However, after reading the sequel to it, ""In the Night Kitchen"" I was horrified. I'm not a prude by any means, but, there was absolutely no reason for the child to be naked and for his genitalia to be portrayed so vividly! The story made no sense at all, and the illustrations featuring the naked little boy joyfully swimming in a jar of milk while three grown men watch him intently was too much for me. I almost put the book down at that point, but, I wanted to finish it. In my humble opinion, this book seems targeted toward pedophiles and perverts. I will not be reading anything else from Mr. Sendak in the future."
1,This book seems inappropriate for children...,"After reading the book, my husband and I both came to the same conclusion, that a small boy being manipulated by three grown men, without his parents knowing where he is, seems very uncomfortable and unusual. There were many uses of imagery that could easily lead one to come to the conclusion that they're sexual in nature. he finally come back ""carefree and dried' into bed.I would NOT recommend this book to any parent."
1,Not worth even 1 Star. Very strange. Should be trashed,"I was very disturberd by this book. Should 3 grown men be looking at a naked little boy? I try to teach my children that this is bad. I would have liked the story, had my children not been looking at a anatomicly correctly drawn little boy. Not appropriate for this age group, unless you are ready to open discussions about childrens bodies."
2,Not as new as they should be,"Book binding and cover looks slightly used. Neither of the books look like brand new crisp books I would purchase at a bookstore. I purchased where the wild things are as we'll and same complaint, almost sent it back."
4,The flights of fancy in a little boy's dream.,"This very short children's book is about a boy who dreams of cakes being prepared in a kitchen. Sendak successfully pictures the dreams of a small child and his flights of fancy in those dreams. Just what one would expect in a dream. The book was a 1971 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a children's book. I think that the reviewer from Oct. 29, 1998, is reading too much into the story. The boy is perfectly safe. This is his dream. And, children often dream of themselves without clothing. There are no purient undertones here. If there were, this book would not have achieved all the claim it has over the years since it was first published."
4,One man's meat is another's poison,"I got this book because I thought my 16-month-old was having nightmares and I'd read this was a good book to explain what dreams are to little children. I was in a big hurry when I bought it and didn't read it first. I'm glad I didn't, because I probably wouldn't have bought it. It is very strange - but it grows on you. At first, I really didn't like it at all - but my son just ADORES it! As soon as I get to the last page he is whining for me to start reading it all over again! Apparently something about it appeals to most kids because he just wants to hear it over and over again!I think it's weird, but I understand it and respect it, and it really doesn't matter what I think about it - the fact that my son enjoys it so much is good enough for me. As for the nudity ..... BIG DEAL! Get over it!"
5,"reality (anatomical reality, too) is good","The purpose of children's books is to help children, in very special ways, prepare for the real world. Real people in the real world have bodies, and open conversations about them are good things. Sendak is a genius, and a visionary."
5,A great classic book!,"I am the mother of 4 children and two grandchildren, I went to the local Barnes and Noble looking for this book today, because my oldest son wants this book for his 3 year old son. I was so sad to see they did not have it. It was one of the favorite for all four kids. I have laughed so much just watching my 4 kids laugh and have fun when they were reading this book! How could you not like this book? If my son, which is 27 remembers this story, and I tried to explain it to the clerk in the store today, and she gave me a very weird look, because I could not remember the title, but I did remember the story.... It is so nice to find it on Amazon and I am able to get it with prime before Christmas! Thank you Amazon!!"
5,we bake cake! and nothing's the matter!,"Mickey is a fantastic throwback to the lovely lovely adventures of Little Nemo In Slumberland, an illustrated comic in American newspapers during the early 20th century. Like Little Nemo, Mickey's adventures drift from panel to panel in a dreamlike trance. The cooks who look like Oliver Hardy always struck me as the best part of the book; as well as Mickey floating in the giant bottle of milk as his little dough plane disintegrates.Why do people find this book controversial? They are the same people who fear and have stifled the powers of their own imaginations. We have all had strange dreams like this, and Sendak has beautifully captured those sleepy moments. Why are they bothered by Mickey's state of undress? Who cares?"
3,In The Night Kitchen,"This book was recommended to me by an elementary school librarian. She loved it, I guess the kids in her school loved it, I didn't love it. It's okay, but reading it to my kids, well, put it this way, there are a lot of other books I think are better."
2,Controversy aside. . .this is a strange story,"My son I don't care about the nudity controversy. What we do care about is the story. It is plain odd! My son was so confused by the story. We read it once (once was enough) and we donated it to our local library. There are a lot of Maurice Sendak fans out there so they will hopefully benefit from our donation to our local library. ""Night Kitchen"" was probably not the best story to introduce my son to his writing."
1,freaky book for a preschooler,"I had heard rave reviews of this book. The only voiced concern I had heard about was the nudity, which I didn't think was a big deal.However, I was disappointed when I received it. I love fantasy, but for a 3 - 5 year old to be reading and seeing pictures about a plot that is both weird and scary (being put into a batter to be cooked?!), I think is unnecessary. Explaining that this is Mikey's dream not helpful, since I think this would scare any toddler from letting themself fall asleep and risk seeing these crazy images!The pictures are well drawn and interesting, but I do not like the storyline and find it frightening for a child to read."
1,strange book....,"I know the author has won awards and all, but this book is just too weird! The story is nothing but strange! Fantasy is ok - but this isn't even entertaining or educational fantasy. I saw the reviews saying that the little boy being naked was bothersome to some people. I really didn't think much about it. He is, after all, a very small child. BUT - it becomes bothersome (ANNOYING) when your small child keeps commenting on it. My daughter is well aware of what the body parts are--and she kept commenting on his! I don't think she paid attention to anything about the story because she was so engrossed in the illustration - just that one! So this book has gone bye-bye from our house. Too annoying to read anymore!!! There are so many better books out there."
2,I read this as a little girl,"I remember reading this as a little girl in Kindergarten (back in 1994). I don't remember the whole story, but I remember the part about getting baked in the dough scared me a lot and when I see the book that's the feeling I get from it. I also had no idea why the little boy lost his clothes. I wish I could recall more of the book to describe, but because it scared me, it definitely wasn't my favorite book."
5,open a kids mind and heart,My kids are 20 and 22 1/2... as though it were yesterday... we all loved it... it went back and forth being one and the others choice every other day. Our hope was to not give 'labels' or make any issue a concept dealing with alleged morality. We 'wanted' free thinkers. We were pretty run of the mill where the kids spent their first 7 and 9 years old... city school. The idea of banning a book is so bizarre to me anyway. It is a wonderful addition to any toddler/child's library.
1,This book should be banned,"I just had to analyze this book for a banned book assiginment, and I found it utterly inappropiate for young children. First of all where does Sandak get off making Mickey naked when there is no reason why he can't be drawn with clothes on. Young children do not need to be exposed to Mickey's genitalia. This book should be removed from all bookshelves. Not only does it have gratuitous nudity it also promotes a religious viewpoint!"
3,Story is a little scary,"The drawings are attractive and creative, but the over all story is a bit scary. I especially don't like ""baking"" the kid in the oven. Cooking is fun but I don't want to introduce the wrong idea to children that oven is a safe place to play."
3,"It's ok, but not a 5 star book...",I purchased this book for my daughter because I had read so many rave reviews from various sources about it. The story is creative but didn't live up to my expectations and didn't seem to do much for my daughter either. Many people seem to really love it though.
4,I liked it,"I remember reading this book as a child and I have to say that I was neither disturbed by the nudity nor frightened by anything in the book. we must remember that Sendak is writing for children and as much as we hate to admit it adults often have no idea what will or will not frighten a child, at the same time each child is very different and what may frighten one child may not affect another in the least. From what I can tell children at a young age do not think being naked is a bad thing and the idea of playing in cake batter is a pleasent idea.When it was read to me I was not at all embarrassed that Micky was naked in fact to me that was just part of the fun.A children's story should be written for the audience and I think that Sendak possesses an incredible talent for telling the stories that children will love. And the really important part after all is that the child loves it."
5,Fable wrought out of myth and the author's fertile imagination,"Magical Horses is an original story based in the magic world of Haitian Vodou and the spirits it invokes. The tale serves as a warning for all of us who are plagued by pride, envy, and avarice. On a deeper level, it is a metaphor for overthrowing evil itself. This delightful and instructive book is suitable for children 7 and over. Adults and adolescents will enjoy the adventurous charm and arresting moral tone that is on every page.-- Douglas Davis is an artist, teacher, performer, and author of 7 books plus many articles and reviews."
5,Baby loves it and so do we!,This is a great thing! Finally a lullaby cd that my husband and I like to listen to as much as our little girl does. Radiohead's haunting melodies work really well on the glockenspiel and vibraphone. Everytime we put it on our baby gets really excited and starts dancing and the music doesn't drive us nuts like other children's cds. I would recommend this to parents and even Radiohead fans that aren't parents. I could listen to it all day.
3,not impressed,"I'm a huge Radiohead fan, but the selection of songs for the cd to cover were poorly chosen. Especially ""there, there"" which is a favorite of mine. I could NOT recognize the song at all. Save your money and get the Bjork and Smashing Pumpkin renditions... MUCH more enjoyable."
5,the thing i hate about radiohead,"you know what I hate about radiohead? you know what i cant stand about the fact that they all know they're a bunch of frigging geniuses and their musical talents are completely unmatched by any other mainstream artist? you know what i hate about the fact that radiohead is probably one of the single most important contributions to the modern rock world that we will ever see? you know what i hate about the fact that radiohead has been voted most likely to find the cure for cancer? the thing I hate most about radiohead is that i love them some much that one day I may actually BUY this CD and I will ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF IT. No questions asked. if radiohead is involved, it is not a waste of your money. god help us all."
4,Quite a phenomenon.,"This series is a fascinating phenomenon, when you think about. First, there's an immediate hip/humor aspect. It's just funny that you can play Radiohead, Metallica, & Flaming Lips tunes to infants & toddlers. (It's hard not to think about what Trent Reznor said he would do to you ""like an animal"" when listening to the lullaby version of ""Closer."") Of course, the big question is whether these CDs are really being bought because the local 10-month old will love it, versus something for the parents to listen to so they don't go mad from the usual baby-music junk. I've listened to a half-dozen of these, including this Radiohead disk and, while the CDs vary in how successful they are, this one is terrific and weirdly beautiful. Like, uh, Radiohead."
5,I am so glad that this exists,"We are expecting a baby in a couple of weeks and I got this as a gift for my husband who is a huge Radiohead fan. All of the songs on the CD are done on what I think is the xylophone. The CD is beautiful and I am just so glad it exists. For my husband who does not really get excited about baby stuff, he was very excited when he received this."
4,Music for me and my Baby,I am a huge Radiohead fan and when I heard of this I had to have it for my little one. We both love it. While it is relaxing to him I get to relax in not having to listen to yet another baby Einstein CD. I would recommend this for any big Radiohead fan... you have to really know the songs to enjoy it.
4,A great resource,"This is a great book full of bare bones facts about how the machinery of our nation works. It says it is for younger kids, but I think everyone would benefit from a quick read, and it could be used as a resource for everyone from elementary to college freshmen. Short paragraphs describe the nuts and bolts of our laws, government, and point out that the power in democracy rests on the shoulders of the citizens. Super!"
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,I was excited to see this movie I got in the theater snd right from the beging it was just animals hurting him of corse your 3 to mabey 9 or 10 would like this movie but young teen I do not recomend seeing this movie.I did walk out of the theater.
1,omg....,I love my kids more than anything so I recently sat through this with my 8 and 4.5 year olds. The whole thing. It left me wishing I had the vasectomy 9 years ago. This was possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I could not recommend this to anyone. Ever. Somewhere on the ninth level is a guy named Adolf being forced to watch this over and over......shudder...
1,Should be PG-13,"This was an OK kids film until they started running around with their underwear pulled up as tight as they could get them. There was no reason to add those scenes, they did not even go with the plot. I would rather my children watch something a little healthier then grown men and teenage boys showing how tight they can get their shorts while standing in front of a camera. What kind of a message is that for children? As far as an adult film, there were a few good parts, but the movie did not flow very well and the ending was like they just gave up on how to close the movie and told all the actors to do anything they thought was funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Forget my other review...this takes the cake at ZERO-10000,"Forget all of my other reviews. This one simply takes the cake as the worst movie ever created. Ed Wood is turning over in his grave, and Albert Brooks will soon after he dies. This is the biggest pile of donkey dung ever put together. Brendan Frasier better get a new agent or be permanently banished into B-C films for the rest of his life. This makes Mummy III look like Oscar material."
2,Wow . .,"Okay, so I love Brendan Frasier, I really do. I love goofy movies too. I liked watching George of the Jungle and Dudley Do Right with our kids. They're silly, but cute. This one I really could barely sit through. There were a couple of funny parts (I have to admit my kids- ages 7, 4, and 2 - giggled several times at things the animals did). My husband and I just kept looking at each other like, really? This movie was really a waste of time and effort on the part of those that made it. And not to be rude, but Brendan wasn't cute anymore (which made me sad) . . chubba bubba! I wanted to like it, really I did. But it was awful."
3,Solid 3 star entertainment....,"With all the negative reviews for this movie i went with the rental...and i waspleasently surprised. Its really a pretty good movie, and i has the feel of thatanimated movie...Out Of Season. The jokes are pretty funny, and the movie shouldbe as good for older kids and adults. Brooke Shields sure is not aging well, butshe plays her role pretty good.good for a rainy day."
3,Furry Vengenance,"I liked this video. I thought it was funny and it was a day I needed to have a laugh. I know that the film was not rated very good, but I enjoyed it."
3,SUCK IT UP,"This is definitely a kids' movie and one that may be difficult for adults to sit through. The animals in the forest not only understand English but are well versed in the laws of physics and automobile operation. The Japanese boss is unmercifully stereo-typed. Animals attack Fraser, who is leading the way to destroy their habitat for the ""green"" company he works for, except no one but him sees the animals. Eventually the animals let out a full assault on the humans. Extremely kid friendly as no animal dies in the movie. The message is that companies which claim to be green are not really green. It would be a good movie to watch along with some BP ads. There is some toilet humor. Most of the humor is of the slapstick variety, with maybe one joke aimed at adults. How many Daily Show stars can you identify in cameo roles?"
3,Good for a few laughs,"This is one of these movies that's enjoyable watching once, but no more than that. I had high hopes for this film given the premise, but while there are some funny scenes, overall this movie fails to impress. Brendan Fraser and the others do decent jobs with acting, so they're not the real problem with this film. It's just the script and dialogue were... blah. I got this from a Redbox, so for a buck, I don't feel ripped off, fortunately."
5,great fresh kids comedy,"I love it,my kids love it.watched few times already.easy to follow,no deep ideas,maybe one:save the forest.good for all family."
3,Silly vengeance.,"I had taken my grandson to see this at the theater and followed up with purchase of the movie for him because he liked it, especially the variety of animals in it. A few mildly amusing parts. Some of the gags were just overkill to me, gross and not especially funny, (being sprayed by 20+ skunks) and a couple of the characters, especially Brendan Fraser's boss, tries to be funny but doesn't even rate a laugh. Pretty mediocre stuff."
1,No Laughing Matter - No Kidding,"Always on the look-out for new authors I picked up this book and well, I wish I hadn't. In a nutshell, Nick Madrid, a freelance journalist, witnesses the death of a young woman - she falls past his hotel window - while covering a comedy festival in Montreal. Nick then becomes a somewhat hesitant gumshoe detective attempting to solve this ""drug related accident"". The author works way too hard to be funny, does a lot of name-dropping and doesn't work hard enough in crafting an engaging mystery or story. I don't see myself pursuing this series any further."
2,OK but not fresh or unique,"Author is mildly funny. Characters are interesting. Plot is a classic Miss Marple (name your British mystery series) wherein all the suspects end up in a room and the sleuth lays it all out - guessing at some actions, certain of others until the bad guy/gal reveals him/herself. Not funny enough to break through the cliched plot. Sorry, old chap."
5,British Humor At It's Best,This is my favorite humorous mystery series by one of my favorite British authors. Nick Madrid is a self-deprecating masterpiece of an unlikely investigative hero. Laugh out loud situations and rapid dialogue combine with a strong mystery to be solved. A great read.
4,Strong Female Characters and Well Researched,"It was a pleasure reading a book with such strong, multi-dimensional female characters. I was especially impressed with the amount of research the author must have done in order to describe not only the political tensions and bigotries of the time; but also the region of the Pacific Northwest, the details regarding older Seattle, its neighborhoods and its populations. Good work!"
2,Biography - George Washington American Revolution,"I watched ""John Adams"" before I watched ""Biography - George Washington American Revolution"", so I felt that ""Biography - George Washington American Revolution"" was just not done as well as ""John Adams"", it seemed that there was a lot left out."
5,A very good program,History dvds in general are boring. This depiction or the Revelution was well done. also the seller was timely in delivery
5,Beautiful mug,Laurel Burch designs are always beautiful and intricate with very imaginative coloring. Good weight for a mug.
3,Do you like PINK????,"The picture shows a red interior, but when it arrived it was a rosy pink color. I HATE PINK. So disappointed. So take this into consideration when ordering this mug and also the Rainbow Safari mug which has the same issue.RED is NOT pink. Grrr..."
1,Pathetic,"This book is pathetic. If you've been living in a hole all alone the past few years of your life, this book might help you. Even then, there are better free resources on the web. I suspect the other reviews on this book are staged by Daneen Skube herself or just written by other low-lifes."
2,Massage heat cushion,"It has ceased to function as of two days ago. The massage was weak and undistiguishable between high and low. The heat function was nice till it stopped working. I used it every day, twice a day, for about two months."
1,You get What You Pay For,"I should have known by the price that this merchandise would not satisfy but tried to save some money. Now I will end up spending more because I will have to replace this piece of inferior junk. My specific complaints include the fact that the converter for automotive use was not included, the fact that the vibrator motors in a portion of the device only operate at one speed and that of the six motors supposed to be present, only four work. My advice is to spend the extra money and buy the better product. In the long run, that is the better economy."
5,Prying open my third eye,"While this CD isn't Tool in thier truest fasion, it does capture the overall feeling of Tool and the emotion that MJK pours into their music. True fans who understand things like Wings for Marie, Judith from APC, the backstory to Eulogy and Message to Harry Manback will enjoy this CD.Being a huge Tool fan since 1992, picking up this CD was a no-brainer. I kid you not, I ordered it for myself for Christmas along with some gifts for others. It wasn't 4 days later that I found I'd be putting the CD to good use in a little under 9 months!"
5,My son loves it,"I purchased this CD as a joke for my wife but my son LOVES it. He can be cranky and fussing in the car and as soon as he hears the first few notes, he relaxes and will quickly be asleep. Very cool. No sissy songs for my son. :-)"
3,Ratcatcher!,"Careful, respectful, and absolutely dead, this Hollywood-and-Vine version of Shakespeare is remembered now only for it's overage lovers: 36-year-old Norma Shearer and 42-year-old Leslie Howard. He gets away with it (just) by giving his usual distracted cutie-pie performance, but Shearer's way of acting virginal is to look as if someone just whomped her on the back of the head with a 2x4 (if you're a fan of ""The Women,"" you'll be amused to see her rapturous rush at the camera turn up here). John Barrymore, once briefly the greatest American Shakespearean, is a florid and pop-eyed Mercutio. The only reason to watch is to see Basil Rathbone, burning up the screen (and winning an Oscar nomination) as Tybalt. The less said about Andy Devine and Edna May Oliver, the better."
4,"Great performances,good writing,GREAT film","I rarely call a movie beautiful,but I found this to be a truly beautiful film.the performances by all the cast members are wonderful,the script is well crafted,and even the cinematography is good.Lukas Haas moved me to tears as a boy who cannot stand to be touched,although he needs to be hugged in the worst way.I highly reccomend this movie."
4,"Hip? Well, these patterns are a good place to start","By ""hip"" I presume the author was trying to create patterns that any fashionable young person would find in catalogs or magazines. There ARE some ""hip"" patterns here--such as tunnel neck tops and a very nice halter top knit in tape yarn. The knitting craze typically features bulkier knits, and there is a long bulky knit coat here as well.I think these patterns are a great place to start--if you adapt them to your own yarns and own sense of fashion. The shapes are good--a roll neck sweater that wouldn't be out of place in a fashion catalog, the tops I mentioned, and a cabled vest that is classic. There are a lot of great novelty yarns available, and with some scratching of the head, calculating yardage and creative visualization, a crafty and hip knitter could make some very original and designer-worthy knits.Vogue, it's not, but there are some really great basics here to work from."
2,Pattern Instructions Lacking,"I recently learned to knit and bought this book because I wanted to try something more challenging than a scarf. Well, I tried the fat hat pattern and found the instructions confusing. Speaking as a beginner, I didn't find the pattern easy to read AT ALL. In fact, I'm still trying to figure it out.Some of the illustrations are helpful and the basics section is useful. There are some nice photos of the projects.I only wish that the patterns were more clear to the beginning knitter. I wanted so much to like this book!"
2,Dorky!,I was given the book as a gift and was eyeing it on amazon thinking it might be good but its pretty lame and I've only had trouble with it. Swartz is trying to sound cool and 'hip' but failing miserably and her lack of detail when it comes to technique and instructions only makes beginner knitters frustrated and angry. The projects are O.K. but they're not great! if you're looking for cool patterns to inspire creativitity and your just starting out go for debbie stollers 'stich n' bitch'. Hip to Knit spends more time trying to sound cool than actually helping and inspiring young knitters.
2,For Experienced Knitters Only,"I've been knitting for a number of years and have navigated my way through a lot of patterns. I agree with another reviewer who said that the clarity of the patterns was sacrificed to ""whimsical design"". As well, methods recommended for patterns - increasing and finishing - wouldn't actually work for the patterns. I did manage to finish a project, but only because I understood how cabling works. If I'd never done it before, I never would have gotten through it. While the pattern claimed to ""introduce two pattern stitches"", it was definitely necessary to have done them before."
4,I love this book,"This books offers a really nice collection of stylish patterns, easy to make, with colorful photos and simple instructions. I'm no expert knitter, and I'd never used circular needles before, but I thought the stocking cap I made from this book was a snap. I also followed the book's easy instructions to make the first mittens I'd ever made. They turned out great! I'm tackling one of the sweater patterns now -- and so far so good!"
3,Not as great as it could be,"I bought the book in a store for instant gratification and I wish I had waited. The basic kniting instructions are spread randomly throughout the book with only occasional references during patterns. The patterns are not easy to follow and I'm glad I had a couple of other books to cross reference. I did make my first sock and mitten, but now need a better book for both. I don't dare try any of the clothing after reading the jumbled patterns. If you are a beginner, I would hold off on this book. If you are more skilled, maybe checking it out of the library first would be a better idea."
2,Not worth the time.,"I am a newly self-taught knitter from Gen-X and was assuming that ""Hip"" meant cool, funky, and modern. What they really mean is ...poorly made. ... The projects are boring and the instruction [poor]. Definately not good for beginners. The only good part about the book was that they have little tips on using different yarns - like ""try this cardigan in a chunky yarn"", but then they don't go any further than that - you have to figure out the rest of the information yourself, i.e., gauge and yarn needed etc. Which may not be a problem for most people, but it was for me. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book. ..."
1,broken junk,"This is extremely flimsy and arrived broken. It was also poorly packaged,which certainly contributed to the breakage, but it would not have survived use anyway because it was clearly not new as advertised. It was yellowed plastic - a sign of decomposition. I didn't pursue returning it because I was hurrying to meet a deadline on the project it was to have been used for when it arrived."
5,SAM CAUGHT SLIPPING,"Sam DeCalvacante office gets bugged back in the 60s. Good stuff is picked up on these bugs, including behind the scene machinations of a mob boss and his family, as well as the national mob. It shows the power of the Commission, and how it holds sway over all families. But this book puts to rest Joe Bonnano's kidknap bs once and for all. His own men admiited on tape that it was a ruse. Good read for some mob history."
4,great controll,fitt and works as promissed. Great ride excellant controll. better than original. Should recomend getting the upper bearinf at the same time.
2,Unreliable,"I wish I could give this book a higher rating. It is filled with information, clearly explained. But Chapter 10 includes an unconscionable, ill-informed, gratuitously nasty discussion of the mathematician Dorothy Wrinch (1890-1976) that not only denigrates her work but her character too. Why savage Wrinch, instead of dispassionately criticizing her papers? Since I can't imagine why, I must assume that the portraits of other scientists in this book are unreliable too."
2,Book for a beginner,This book is for the beginning collector. If you want detail do not buy. Has general information only.
5,The response to my order was exceptional and 5 star quality,"Pulley craftsman 48 "" tractor lawn mower. The order was processedmuch much quicker than the local Sears store. Thanks mow town.Rick"
1,Acceptable in the 80s,"Very very disappointed. The projection used on the map is absolutely nonsensical. Worse, the map was produced in 1999. It still has such extinct countries as Yugoslavia on it. Waste of money."
3,Ordered this a month ago...,"Well, I ordered this product a month ago and am still waiting for it. The company did notify me of the reason why and that they WOULD eventually be sending it. That said, it's still been a month."
1,Unacceptable,"I have been waiting for two weeks to receive my item. I sent them three messages trying to figure out what was happening, with no response. I am still waiting to either receive my item or get a full refund. Absolutely horrible customer service."
3,so-so,Bought this to put in a kids room and immediately noticed spelling errors on the map. It's a nice looking poster but shouldn't they make sure they spell the names of the places correctly??
3,This is a great map of the world,This is a great map of the world. I was hoping that it would show the different countries a bit more distinctly.
4,Video is the only problem,"I use this docking station at work. It is great except for the monitor output. There is a time lag and then the mouse jumps. It drove me crazy. I eventually connected the laptop directly to the monitor rather than going through the docking station. It is one more thing to unplug, but it saves me a lot of aggravation."
1,Horrible,"I've been working with Logic Pro 7 and 7.2 for some months now. It is so cumbersome to use and so filled with bugs that all creativity is lost. I spend countless hours trying to figure out how to solve technical problems. One feels as though they must be a computer science major to figure the thing out rather than a musician. I've been through tutorials, and I've read several books. They helped a bit, but not much. It still feels like I'm lost in a world of technical computer stuff that is not very well put together. I started out with Performer, and made a huge mistake by not going with Digital Performer. Even though it is a very costly error, I will get rid of Logic and go back to Digital Performer.If you enjoy spending hours and even days being irritated and frustrated, then by all means, Logic is for you. If you want to create music - forget it!"
2,Messy food,This food is very soft and starts to fall apart as soon as it hits the water. My water was cloudy within a week if using it.
4,great book with Indian themes,There is plenty of Indian colour in this novel. The wonderful characters come to life on the page and the situations are full of humour and warmth. I really enjoyed it.
1,Two months - tops,"Purchased two of these for use in a motorcycle after disappointing results with high performance bulbs from Sylvania and Phillips. Each of these lasted about two months. Hella provides a 12 months warranty, but when contacted, Hella (manufacturer) referred me to Amazon (seller), and Amazon referred me to Hella."
2,Good replacement but not much lifetime!!!,"It is exactly factory replacement for many cars. It is as same size (length) as the bulb i took off. It is as bright as other factory bulb. Color matches. Don't expect super white or Christal white. It is warm white like most of halogen bulbs.Update: After 6 months moderate usage of it, it is gone. So when you consider the life time, don't buy it..."
2,Economic - but - Very Short Life,"I brought this on May 21, 2011.Good Lighting...Better than Sylvania standard.However after 4 months they are just gone... that's very short life for low intensity bulb.Lesson of the purchase......This time i am going with sylvania.... I just need to spend 3 more bucks...But i can be sure that it will last for an year at least..."
2,Sounds like a keyboard arrangement,"The arrangements were very simplistic, like someone playing a key board and not very interesting."
5,Amazing story,"This book tells an amazing story and has been a true inspiration for many people. Other groups/institutions/governments have tried to duplicate the methodology that was used in Sicily to improve their own cultures - moving from crime and corruption to a ""culture of lawfulness."" To see how a society has been able to move forward is great - it takes courage to be an optimist and obviously Leoluca Orlando and the people who worked with him were very courageous!"
3,menza menza,"Overall an interesting read, but it was a little wordy. Mr. Orlando is a politician not a professional writer, and that was obvious."
3,Misread the label,"When I purchased this, I thought it was the regular board game. I read the label wrong (dah). But this is for a gameboy, so I gave it away to a child who has a gameboy. Of course they love it."
5,Foggy Mountain Gospel CD,"Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs singing old timey, soul searching, bluegrass music; this is a great CD; two legends who left Bill Monroe and started their own style of bluegrass, the rest is history. You can't go wrong with this CD. Recommended for all music fans."
1,it does not work.,"If i set it in high it does not heat, or turn off. I have to disconect it in order to start again. It only gets warm in position 4, and the temperature it reaches is not enough to produce any effect."
2,Sad face,I have purchased two of these in the last two years. One lasted 30 days and died didn't bother sending back not worth the time.
1,Works great...for about 6 months,"I've gone through two of these and both of them kicked the bucket after about 6 months. The last one going out in flaming glory by burning a hole in my new couch. Needless to say, I will not buy again and would not recommend for others."
1,not worth your time or money,Bought one for my mother.Lasted 3 weeks can't get a replacement without the receit.I've had heating pads that last 20 years but this is not worth your time or your money.
1,Don't buy - quality very poor,"Although I like the heating pad while it works, the control is very, very poor.This pad comes with a 2-year limited life time warranty. I got my first on on Nov 28, 2010. The control failed 5 months later. I got my warrenty replacement heating pad on 4/13/2011 and it only lasted only 3 months. As of July 10, 2011 the warrenty replacement one went bad. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,A heating pad that generates no heat!,"Terrible product! Save your money. This heating pad neither heats properly nor retains the little heat it does generate.It turns off spontaneously and within a short time of turning it on. The concept of a wrap-around heating pad is a great idea,however this is NOT a great product. The major flaw with the product is that it simply does not generate much, if any heat. The low setting produces almost no heat at all, and the high setting is barely warm. I had to return the product and I recommend you save your money and invest in a typical heating pad that you can keep wrapped around your back with a cheap neoprene belt."
2,No goldilocks spot,"I've had this for over a year and it just annoys me. I like the design, it is easy to wrap around a knee etc, but that's not enough. Even the lowest setting is too hot. I spend all the time I use it turning it on and off because there is no goldilocks setting that is just right. All the settings are too hot. I think they should start putting a dial on heating pads instead of settings that the user cannot control."
2,Durability/longevity an issue,"I have tried this model a number of times and have been disappointed in the longevity. Less than 6 months after purchase, the heating pad is no longer working properly. I have had this problem in the past and have contacted Sunbeam previously for replacements. I was hoping the technology had improved to the point where it would be reliable, but sadly, it obviously hasn't. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of choices in reasonably priced heating pads. Most of the ones I have purchased in the past have had very limited durability. It appears that the controller for the heating pad is at fault. I probably won't be desperate enough to try this one again."
4,good fit,This heating pad conforms nicely and gives and even heating warmth. The straps can be a little cumbersome and tricky if you are trying to strap it on your shoulder but with an extra hand (help) it works great once it is attached.
1,Short life,"This pad was great while it worked, but in less than three months it stopped heating. As mentioned in other reviews, the control displayed an F1 reading, and none of the control buttons worked. I liked the pad while it functioned, so will probably buy another one. I may get lucky and get a good one as some reviewers have done. But I am also looking for a similar product from another manufacturer."
3,A heating pad that ain't too hot.,This pad is comfortable and the velcro straps are very helpful for using it around different body parts. But it just doesn't get hot enough and the gray plug/switch is very clunky.
1,Fire hazard,I really liked this heating pad until one day I smelled a scortching smell. Eventhough it has an auto shut off this got hot enough to melt its own internal heating wires. After we unplugged the device we cut it open just to see what happened and sure enough all of the wires we melting and there was a big black scortch mark. I read on line that certian versions of this heating pad are on recall.I was really bummed because it was good for maintaining the heat right where you wanted it with the straps. I also liked the heat control it was nicer than most and I liked the different heat setting options.TOO BAD.
1,"Baby, it's cold on there","After using this thing for more than an hour, I still couldn't tell if my body was warming the heating pad or if the heating pad was warming my body. I tossed it under the bed in disgust and haven't used it since. It's got the fancy-smancy controls and velcro and looks pretty and shiny, but it's a major disappointment.Remembering Mom's old heating pad, I went online and bought a USED heating pad - that dates back to the 1960s. When it arrived, I was pleased as punch. Fire that thing up and put it on LOW and the radiating warmth sends you to a state of raptured bliss. Set it on high and you'll be able to drop a couple eggs on it and fry 'em up real nice.But this Sunbeam Heating Pad (featured here) is a waste of money. I was profoundly disappointed in its performance. On its highest heat setting, the warmth really is barely discernible. If you're in pain, you don't have time to waste on this."
1,Lasted 4 months!,"I bought this to replace the original I had that last well over 5 years. This one is dead after 4 months, and I really need it!The original wasn't Made in China, this one is. Sick of American companies making their products in China, it's all crap!"
1,"tiny, uncomfortable","Seems like a good idea, but poorly executed. The pad is tiny and doesn't get very hot. The velcro strap is too short to be of any real use. My son wears size 28 pants and the strap barely went around him and dug into his waist. The only positive thing is the well-designed controller."
2,Too hot and undependable,"I am on my second model of this heating pad. The first one worked for a few months and then began flashing a red light. With both of these hearing pads there only seems to be one setting ""burn your skin off"" hot. It is terrible. I am not sensitive to heat either. There must be something wrong with Sunbeam heating pads."
1,Sunbeam strikes again,"Apart from the enormous control brick and power connector, the design of the heating pad is excellent. HOWEVER, looks can be deceiving, and, as with so many other reviewers, I found out that the heating part of the described function is only a distant dream of Sunbeam. My pad would heat for a few minutes and then gradually go stone cold. Unplugging the unit and plugging it in again started the cycle of hope, quickly followed by disappointment, once more. I could call the heating pad very dependable, in that it dependably failed to perform as advertised. I got a refund, and just added this experience to decades of disappointment with Sunbeam products. I really thought they might have reformed. Hope springs eternal."
5,Excellent Product,This heating pad is an excellent value for the price. It is very adaptable to areas of the body that need heat applied. The velcro allows the pad to be held securely to my wife's back which is why we purchased this product. We had purchased two more for relatives prior to this one. Our relatives love this pad also.
2,Works great for a hot minute.,"Fool me 3 times.... I have gone through the last of these I will buy, sadly. It's by far the best heating pad on the market - with its great shape, heat intensity, options and straps - but it F2's in less than a few weeks! (Anyone who has bought one knows that F2 is the Sunbeam error for ""WAAAAH-WAAAAAAAAAH....."")I wish this thing worked, because it's pretty awesome until it aborts itself."
1,Worst heating pad out there!,"I suffer from chronic back pain so I've been through several heating pads. The first time I purchased this pad I really loved the design but after less then 1 month it quit working, the digital read out read ""F-2"". I called the company and told them the problem so they sent me a replacement out. The replacement lasted a little longer but then same results ""F-2"" then dead. I know I should have learned my lesson but I foolishly purchased another 1 just because of the design. I did get about 3 months out of the last one but the exact same end result. Terrible product!"
1,Shame on Sumbeam,"Don't buy this pad - I'd had a couple earlier ones that lasted at least a year & I liked the design, so I thought I'd give it one more try but this one only lasted three months!"
5,MY HEAVEN,"I did not get this on Amazon got it while on vacation and my back was not dealing with the resort mattress very well.I have disk degeneration and displacement, and a need to lay on my side to sleep by being able to attach the pad I can lay how I need to lay still have the pad secure and helping to calm the spasms and pain so I can sleep.LOVE LOVE Love it!"
1,Real Heat,"I had this product for 4 months. I used it for about 3 days when I first got it and didn't have to use it again until 4 months later. The first time I used it, it really wasn't the most impressive thing, the heat is rather lame. With other pads I usually put a light cover to make sure my back doesn't get harmed but with this the t-shirt on your back would suck up a ton of heat. That said, plugging it in after 4 months there was no response, I tried pressing the on a couple times nothing. I tried another socket and the controller blew up in my hand giving me a light burn... sadly it blowing up gave me more heat than it could produce over 3 days. I will never buy any sunbeam product ever again, I don't need to be injured with cheap garbage. I think I've finally learned my lesson of ""getting what you pay for""."
2,Not a lot on practical implmentation,"Thisis book gives a lot of stratgies but does not give many examples of how to implement those strategies, and thus rendering the materials given in this book not very useful."
3,"Good, but repetitive.","I just bought this CD today and was surprised at how many different mixes they had of the same song (Up & Down). The mixes are pretty good, but some of them are so far-removed from the original that one can't even tell what is being mixed. My other gripe is that most of the songs sound too much of the same. However, it's great computer music because there are absolutely no lyrics except for ""up . . . and down"", so it won't distract you while you're typing! ^_^"
3,Good song...bad CD,"I think this (Up & Down) is a good song, but I'd rather just hear one exact version instead of it being all messed up in different versions. I'd like it if they just sold a plain single (just one song, one version) for about $4 like their other song 'We Like to Party'. They could also sell this messed up version for anyone who wants to hear the gay versions, but just one for me, please!"
2,Disappointing,This dictionary lacks countless words and does a poor job of cross referencing to much needed synonyms.
4,"all cd's from Andrea Bocelli,","Amazon has the best selection, and service if you are looking for special item's, normally not available in Retail Stores."
5,Andrea Bocelli - Under the Desert Sky,As seen on PBS fund drives: excellent performance and quality. No-hassle ordering and fast shipping.
5,Intoxicating!,"Under The Desert Sky is an ideal video to watch if you want to spend a romantic evening.Set in a luxurious resort with a floating stage, Andrea performs songs mostly from Amore - easy listening stuff like Besame Mucho accompanied by acoustic guitars.There are special guests and moments, lively dancing and the finale - where men leap into the water accompanied by fireworks.Unlike the opera heavy Concero, Under The Desert Sky is basically easy listening with romantic flourishes."
4,Andrea Bocelli - Under the Desert Sky,"Great, it was great to see Andrea in less formal settings. We loved the interview parts, it's pasta time, very funny. Easy to listen to and to watch."
5,Every Thing Is Absolutely Beautiful,"I got my first Andrea CD ""Time To Say Goodbye"" 13 years ago and still play it while driving.This DVD was intended to give to a friend who travels a lot by car for business.I opened the package (it's not a serious gift, I can give him just like that) when it arrived yesterday to see how the concert looked like. I wanted just to listen one or two songs and to do other things already planned.Then I ended up watching this DVD three times from the afternoon until late night... ... Every thing was fabulous.Now I have to keep this copy and order another one for my friend."
5,This DVD is just plain MAGNIFICENT!!!!,"WOW, is the one word that stands out when I play this DVD/CD. I wasn't crazy about Andrea Bocelli (not crazy about Opera) until I saw this, (his first ever), ""Pop"" Concert. There's no better way than to spend an evening with someone you love, (enjoying perhaps some soothing Cabernet), watching and listening to the most Beautiful Spanish, Italian and even French Love songs. The Orchestration he uses in this Concert is Superb. The Visual Clarity and Audio (especially when using DTS) on this DVD stands out as the Premiere DVD to watch when you want to watch a ""Live Concert"". Nothing comes close!It's simply Magnificent!!"
1,3 cd's ordered all defective. Rec,"Rec'd 3rd cd yesterday - same thing Defective. Will have to send back.Look at all the E-mail correspondenceOrder #'s Blowitoutahere 1st 2 cd's, last one Amazon.donnaped@tds.net"
5,Andea Bocelli,"Fabulous Cd, I love the quiteness he brings to my soul. The DVD is relaxing to but his voice is magical. Thanks to David foster for finding him for us."
4,Good concert,"I like Andrea Bocelli, he's got a great voice. But some of the songs in this concert are too flat, I didn't like half of the songs in this concert. The new DVD Vivere is much better!"
5,Andrea Bocelli,"Exellent.My family and friends really enjoed this video/concert. Nice setting, wonderfull musik. Something we wil keep and watch for a very ling time.I am very happy with this purchase."
5,What a combo-Andrea bocelli and David Foster,David Foster has really done a fantastic job producing the CD for Andrea.I enjoyed the selection of songs and the duets. Would like to see another CD similar to this one produced in the future!
5,Awesome Video!!!!!,"The setting is absolutely breathtaking. The music is supurb. The creative minds that put this video together should get an award! Andrea Bocelli and David Foster are masters of their respective crafts. The first time I watched this DVD, I actually cried! It is so beautifully moving. Having visited Lake Las Vegas a couple of years ago, this video holds a very special place in my heart. It brought back so many wonderful memories of our trip there. This is the most romantic concert I have ever seen. This is truly a remarkable work of art.I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this DVD!"
5,A MUST for those who like Bocelli!,"I already liked the recordings of Bocelli's music, but to see him performing was indeed a treat. His pleasant personality comes through in his ""visits"" with the audience and in the interview with him. The support he has in this DVD from the orchestra is outstanding, and Bocelli and the conductor make a good team. I highly recommend this DVD and hope that he will do another one soon."
4,Breathtaking,Bocelli does not disappoint with this presentation of romantic music in a magnificent setting. The dynamic of the location and the setting of the sun during the show (and resulting images) is beautiful. Surprising guest performers compliment his own performance. You can't miss with David Foster either! There is a surprise effect during one selection that is powerful and evokes an emotional response to the music. We watch this video over and over - it IS that good! Don't expect opera as you will be disappointed .... this is pure magical romantic music.
4,muy bueno.,aun esta funcionando y trabaja super bien. excelente sonido y muy practico. si existiera aun este producto lo volveria a comprar con los ojos cerrados
3,Alright,"More clarity than my old Altec Lansing ACS54, and the additional headphone jack is very useful. However, the sub does not have much power. Also, I don't need surround sound for my PC."
2,Skim this title but don't write off Island Press,"From Island Press in 1993, this collection of essays lacks the insight and inspiration needed to jolt a new generation of environmental leaders. Emphasis in this book is on vague ""environmental leadership"" rather than leadership skills that can boost the laggard enviro-nonprofit sector to look for opportunites to impliment innovation and reinvent itself to create true social, economic, and environmental change. The essaysist here tend to come out of conservation science and the product is thus technical in nature and content. I fear the tendency for budding enviro-leaders would be to come directly to this text but there is much more for them in the general nonprofit sector leadership books from Drucker, Nanus/Dobbs, et al. I respect Island Press and hope that it will produce the text that will truely inform and inspire that new generation of leaders. Island is the one that is wise enough to do it right next time."
3,A good first novel,"Timothy Hillmer's novel The Hookmen is a good first novel, and shows promise and potential for the writer. This is the story of Roy Cruz, a young man, who works for the forest service in California on the Kern River. Part of his job is to be a ""hookman"", to rescue people from the river and, more often, to recover the bodies of drowning victims. Hillmer writes well of the river and the men (and they are all men) who work it, also throwing in a troubled relationship between Cruz and his alcoholic father and a love interest between Cruz and a free-spirited beauty. I do not consider this a ""great"" book, because parts of the writing appear ""clunky"" and scenes a bit predictable. Hillmer, though, consistently kept my interest and got me genuinely to care about Cruz and the other river men."
2,The worst of Christine Feehan,"I have read all the Dark series books and this one was the worst. The flow was disjointed, the Scarlettis were irritating, and Byron was the least interesting Carpathian. I was really looking forward to Byron's story, but the whole Scarletti thing took too much of the book and you really didn't get to know Byron at all. Which is too bad because I really didn't like the heroine too much. While I couldn't wait to finish the rest of the Carpathian novels, I had to force myself to get through this one."
2,"Not tonight, I've got a headache","The only good thing I can say is that once you've read one of the sexual encounters (please, let's not call them love scenes)in any of the books in this series, you can skip ahead 20 pages or so and not miss any of the so-called plot. If you crave sensuality, try the Merry Gentry or Antia Blake series."
2,Unfortunately,"I'm a fan of the Dark series Ms. Feehan has written. Unfortunately, I'm just going to be blunt and say that this book bored me. It's almost as if she was bored herself writing this book. I got it sometime last year, got through half of it and haven't finished it yet, and I've never done that with a book in my entire life. This is something I would not suggest for anyone to buy."
1,Painful!,"The male Carpathian population must be in greater peril than previously believed if testosterone-deficient Byron is the among the scant remaining members. With every page I turned in ""Dark Symphony"" I became increasingly dissatisfied with the story. I even shelved it for a week before finishing it. (I never did THAT before with a Christine Feehan book.) ""Dark Symphony"" is a painful read and an unworthy addition to the Dark Series. Stick with the tried and true, Christine Feehan."
3,OK... but not as good as other Dark Series,I don't like this book as much as I like other Dark Series. It sets up my expectations for the Dragonseekers and the futher of the Carpathian race. But I don't find the main characters equally interesting.
3,Not for Feminists,"I have a *huge* problem with Feehan's work - I hate how she writes her women. Her entire series is based on the theory that men know best and women need to shut up and obey. Honestly, if you're looking for romance, her series might not be the best place to go since rape and non-consentual acts abound, all deemed OK by applying the term ""soulmate"" to it.I will say this...if you dig through the dreck, some of her work can be tolerable (such as ""Dark Symphony""), but the writing is trite and be warned of the overuse of ""lightening"" and ""spicy"" in every love scene. You'll begin to wonder if the love scenes are photocopied, with only the names changed from book to book. You won't find anything terribly new here, but if you like vampires and macho, overbearing men who don't actually listen to what women say, then go for it. The heroine actually has some backbone in this one!"
1,Waiting,"Can't rate it yet as I haven't read this one yet, because it ties into the the Scarletti Curse and I feel I should read that first because the intro refers to it. Waiting for this book to arrive."
2,Not as good as the others,"I've read every book in the Dark series, and I agree with the others who've mentioned that it's best to start with Dark Prince and work your way through. The books can and do stand alone, but you won't get a lot of what's going on if you don't have the background.Anyway, while I did read this book in a couple of days, I wasn't impressed. The story just felt rushed. Within the first few pages the heroine and her grandfather are kidnapped, and the hero saves the day. Instead of having a series of events that culminate in a single event, the entire book is like one climactic event after another. There's a double kidnapping, near death by falling object, stabbing, shooting, etc. Too much in too little space.For continuity's sake, read it if you're into the series. But try to borrow it from your local library or a friend..."
1,Dark Symphony,"I am a big fan of Christine Feehan's Dark Series. However, I have to admit that this book is sorely lacking her usual talents. I have read the first eight in her series and could not put them down. I read each in a matter of a few hours. Dark Symphony took me a week to read. I just could not get into the story at all. What was missing? Many devoted fans waited for several years to read Byron's story. We wondered what happened to him following his treatment at the hands of the ""humans"" who were trying to destroy the Carpathians, believing them to be the undead. Little was mentioned about this. Trying to tie this story in with Scarletti's Curse instead of letting it stand on its own took away from the novel. I'm glad I read it because of the series, however I can't recommend this one. Sorry."
1,A major disappointment,"I usually run to the bookstore the day they release Ms. Feehan's novels and for the most part I love them. Dark Symphony however just did not work for me. Her attempt to marry her Scarletti novel with the carpathian novels just didn't jive. I liked that she included more characters into the novel like Antonietta's family and Byron's family. I was very happy that the character had some differences and was not the perfect young twenty something but the intrigue and mystery just did not work. I was just unhappy that it did not flow and it got too busy for me , the dialogue was not all that great, and frankly I couldn't wait for the book to end. I was really disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great plot,"Feehan escapes from the clutches of formula writing to create an intriguing plot that combines mystery and romance. While her other Carpathian novels are fun reading, this one excels and intrigues."
3,Good book.,"This book is on a slightly different thread then the rest of the carpathian books,but it is still good. I gave it only three stars because of my personal preferences. Actually more like three and a half. But its good, have no worries."
1,What happened?????,"I am a great fan of Christine Feehan and the Dark Series. But, this book is boring. I received the book on Friday and have not gotten passed Chapter 5. The other eight books,I could not put down and could not wait to read what was going to happen next. With Dark Symphony, the characters do not have any attraction towards each other that I can feel. It just does not work for me."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I have to agree with a few other reviewers...Overall, I was disappointed in the book. I was excited to pick up Byron's story as he has been in a couple of other books and his character was interesting. However, unlike her previous books, Byron's character lacked grit in Dark Symphony. The storyline was interesting but slow. Certain accounts were drawn out far longer than needed and the development of the characters was superficial. If you have not read a book in this series, do NOT read this one first. I have read all of the ""Dark"" series and have enjoyed all of them. It's not necessary to read them in order but I would definitely recommend that you do, as the characters continue to pop in and out of the series. Dark Magic is my favorite."
3,I could barely find the plot for all the SEX!,"Plot? What plot? There was actually a plot? The whole mystery of who is trying to kill Antonietta and her family is lost in the whole courtship between her and Byron. Don't get me wrong, the erotic scenes were certainly erotic--though they did get repetitive; how many times was I to read ""the swell of her breast""? The Carpathian world was intriguing, as well, and there was enough information for me, as a first-time reader of the series, to catch on to the nuances of this breed. And I liked that the heroine was blind and overweight. Curves are good! But the plot was weak, and seemed to serve as bridges between the erotic parts, when it should be the other way around. Oh well. It was a good beach read, which is what I used it for!"
1,Dark Symphony-What a Disappointment,"I bought this one expecting more of the same great Carpathian excitement. Unfortunately, this one doesn't seem to have any. I usually read these in a day or two. This one took me more than a week.It's still not terrible, but see if you can borrow it rather than buy it."
4,Dark secrets and mysteries abound.,"I must admit that this is only the second book I've read from the Dark Series... or Christine Feehan for that matter; the first one being Dark Prince. These books were recommended to me, so after loving Dark Prince I was eager to read more and was ready to get my hands on any of the series.Dark Symphony didn't disappoint me. Antonietta Scarletti was blinded in a boating accident as a child, the same accident that killed her parents. Since the lose of her sight she has only had two passions - her family and music. It was the music that drawed Byron to her and in her he found his life mate, the woman who restored colour to his eyes and made him love again.But someone is stalking the Scarletti family and Byron is determined to save Antonietta and the rest of her family from whatever evil is lurking at their door. A story full of mystery and a family's dark past, Dark Symphony keeps an avid reader all night reading."
3,Least Interesting of Carpathian Series,"I am a big fan of Christine Feehan and was aboslutely thrilled when I learned the newest book was out. Unfortunatley, I wasn't as thrilled after I read it. Dark Symphony is Feehan's attempt to blend two series together, the Scarletti's (Lair of the Lion, the Scarletti Curse) and the Dark Series. It doesn't work. The characters don't play well off each other. Byron, the Carpathian, is not as strong a character as those in the other Dark books. Whereas Antonietta Scarletti overshadows the Carpathian, and all other characters. It's more of a play off of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" with a tad of darkness thrown in. Wait for it to hit the library, [...]."
1,Superstitious hope,"Basically a book about arranging one's environment in ways that would bring one good fortune.According to the author, traditional Chinese belief includes the belief that well-being is governed by three kinds of luck that emanated respectively from heaven, earth, and oneself. Heavenly luck is difficult to change, but feng shui ""wisdom"" shows one how to change the other two elements in one's favour.Chapter titles are -- Wealth Feng Shui- Prosperity Numbers and Good Fortune Symbols- Individual Wealth Orientations- Feng Shui for Business and Commerce- Corporate Feng ShuiTo my mind the sources of many superstitions have some or other elements of truth; alas, this material is not the source. At best the book's material shows one that one's cluttered and disorganised environment reflects a like mind. One might also live in hope of gaining wealth from the practice.____________________________________________"
2,a read for a beginner,In the beginning Too explain the chinese symbols to attract wealth and the number theories were good. Then the other chapters devote for homes and businesses. This book is small and simple for a beginner.
5,Solid Movie,I saw this movie the other day and was very impressed. I found the movie to be well written and I was thorougly engrossed from the start. The movie did a good job of transitioning from humor to drama and never seemed over-the-top of one or the other. This was all the more amazing when you consider this is a first time writer/director. I expect to see a lot out of him and would recommend you see the movie as it is entertaining.
3,special ed-ition,"Over all it was a good movie. Slow but thoughtful. Reminds us that we can get anything at anytime in life. Dont torment or bully people, they could very well indeed be the ones who you need to turn to for help.All of the cast did a good job.Jason Earles performance was great. Short but great none the less."
2,Checklist for life,"This product arrived in a timely manner, was in good shape, nothing at all to complain about except I was a little disappointed in the content of the book, there are too many pages devoted to things that could be taken care of in a page or two, I wouldn't put some info in the book such as accoount #'s for bank accounts or other info such as SS#'s without being sure the book is secure somewhere."
5,If you like Rock,"If you like Rock, you like this and all the other Dramarama. I still cannot beleive this band did not do better. I was lucky to have seen them many times. You can't go wrong this this cd."
5,Sirius Satellite Tuner,"This is a great product. I purchased it for my boyfriend who travels frequently and was dismantling his home kit every time he wanted to bring the Sirius with him... now although this is larger than the home kit, it is less cumbersome because it is all together in one package.Now if only I can get him to carry it on his shoulder since the '80s are coming back! Seriously, product is great, price was even better and making the bf happy..."
3,Good.......but.......,"I purchased this boom box to accomadate my plug n' play unit. The sound is decent, depending on which ""station"" you are listening to. Sirius offers more bandwidth to stations which have more people listening and vice verca. However, $100 I would have expected a unit with superbass. The unit works great outdoor and I am very satisfied, however for indoor use I had to purchase the TERK SIR6 outdoor antenna - it was easy to install but it was another $45 to make a $100 unit work.Howerver, I do have to say the programming that Sirius offers is great and full of variety. My heart is warmed everytime I think that Clear Channel has lost another listener to Sirius."
4,Works well,Two nits: Power switch is easy to bump and audio spectrum is biased to the low side. That said this is a nice toy to allow you listen to Sirius anywhere.
3,Location makes all the differance,"I enjoy continous music at home, however was disappointed when I couldn't get any reception during part of my weekend stay at a resort. The problem seem to be with the direction of the building which we stayed the first night. However, once we moved to a room which had a balcony facing a differant direction we had no more problems. Location does make a differance.At home the music comes in clearly, that's a good thing."
5,Kershaw baby boa,"Its a kershaw, what can i say? Quality is very good and size is perfect. Fits in the change pocket in my jeans. Its too nice to use as my everyday knife so i bought another knife to use. I dont care if that one gets scratched up or if someone asks to borrow my knife."
4,Very cool looking. Not without its flaws.,Pros:Sweet looking knifeThe blade looks cool - it has a very high glossOuter finish is very attractive and durableEasy to carry in front pocketDeploys easilyCons:The blade is just too curvy to be usefulIt's very hard to sharpenThe opening on the side is a major dust collector
4,Great knife,"I loved this knife from the moment I saw it. Holds an edge fairly well, and picks it up again easily with a steel. My only complaint with this knife is that although that hole in one side is meant to look cool and allow you to see the torsion bar, it also allows debris inside which can jam the knife. In this case, just be prepared to take it apart and clean it out. Really is a nice looking and sized knife."
4,Nice but not Great,"The knife arrived nicely packaged although I did notice some small scratches on one side of the blade. I know I will likely put some on myself but you would expect your knife to come as new.This is a small knife, good for EDC nice blade and design. It is not possible for me to deploy this knife with the thumb stud I must use the index finger option. The safety is very tight I need to pick up a #6 Torx driver to fix this and remove the clip.Unless you have a very small hand this knife will take some getting used to before you feel comfortable. I also recieved the Ken Onion Leek at the same time. Much more comfortable knife and smoother operation then the baby boa but it is larger and heavier as well in my opinion not suitable for EDC unless you work construction.In the long run I am sure I will enjoy this knife."
2,I loved it at first,"I bought this mug less than three months ago and loved it. It is certainly beautiful. However, this morning when I poured hot water into it it cracked along the bottom and side. There was no impact from anything - just the hot water from the kettle. Now it is not usable as a mug, so I am very disappointed and will buy no more Laurel Burch mugs."
5,Great product!,"I use these to keep a little extra diesel fuel on our sailboat. They are very high quality, and you don't have to worry about puncturing it with reasonable use due to their thickness. I'm quite happy with the two I bought, and will likely pick up a couple more to ensure I have plenty of fuel for those long motorings up and down the Washington state coastline."
3,disappointing,"I was hoping to see what the ancient Church thought about the end times, which are described in chapter 24. All I got was a bunch of off the wall allegories that applied to the then here and now. One example is the farmer's field really means the Catholic Church. Another is the person on the house top had a closer relationship to God than people standing on the ground.I had better luck on volume XII on Revelation. The universal belief was that the second coming and resurrection would occur in the second half of the seven years."
2,The Book makes Madonna appear like a superficial fake.,The information does not appear to be accurate. Quotes are taken completely out of context. This book makes Madonna seem very superficial.
4,Not like the rest,"Not what you expect if your knowledge of Tantra is what you've heard in New Age circles. This book deals with exploring the dark cupboards of your body/mind. On it's own it does not give enough information for the novice (that's why only 4 stars)and could in fact be dangerous. However that said....Read it, think about it..use it as a starting point for your exploration."
2,READER FROM GREECE,"This book is arranged in a Q&A mode.Though the questions seem interesting,I was not at all satisfied with the answers provided.Then again,I am somehow informed on the subject.If you are not a true beginner in Tantra,dont buy the book.You may find it somehow elementary and simple.However,if you are just starting and want some first information on the subject,I would say it is an excellent introduction to Tantra,though quite brief.Enjoy !"
1,"No stars, but that is not a choice","The simplest way to decsribe ANY books by this author, including this one, is to say the following : He is not interested in the subject matter itself. Instead, he is engaged in the practice of cultivating a big fat ego for himself. Rarely does such a thing reach a level so obnoxious and stanky. If you buy it, you might order a bar of soap to go with it. At least you'll have something to scrub your hands with after reading it."
4,Raw and real,"Juliana Beasley shows a real and sometimes shocking side of the strip club industry. The pictures are not of glamourous dancers, they are of real women who work in strip club, and their stories aren't always pretty. She is honest about what goes on in the lap dance rooms.As a dancer I can relate to what was written in this book. My experience has been different than the author's, but I recognize the stories she tells and I appreciate that she didn't sugar coat the truth of the matter. She was honest about her participation, and that is refreshing, and her photography is beautiful."
3,Interesting.,"I liked this book but couldn't get through a lot of the letters, they were so fake seeming, though I'm sure they weren't. The general storyline was good and the pictures are telling in their crudeness. A nice ""coffee table"" book."
2,Book written under a pseudonym,"Name on Cover is John Miles, which is a pseudonym used by Jack Bickham. This pseudonym was probably used for Bickham's more adult books. Book is about a botched bank robbery that is more about a guy screwing his wife multiple time. Ending not bad."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This appears to be a book that wanted to capitalize on two things--the popularity of both the Titanic and Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately, it does neither of them justice. Seil does not have a handle on Holmes'character, and the Great Detective comes across as a shadow of his former self. Entrusting a fledgling agent (and Irene Adler's daughter, no less--OY!) with such an important mission is unrealistic. And, if all else fails and the plot runs dry (which it frequently does), throw in some trivia about the Titanic to fill in space. Neither Sherlockians or Titanic afficianados will like this book. At least this one does not."
5,Avery readable book.,I found this book to be very readable. It has Holmes (coming out of retirement) and Watson boarding the Titanic on a mission to help out Irene (Adler) Nortn's daughter on a mission to the United States. There are several interesting sub-plots along the way
5,Great toy,My boys love this simple toy! It is inexpensive and needs no batteries!! And since this review requires a minimum of words I will write this extra sentance...
2,Neither gun worked,Two guns and both duds. They don't have enough pressure or enough of a seal to shoot. (Two more words - got it.)
4,Potato guns are so cool!,"Potato pistols are kind of fun. They are kind of short range, so you have to be pretty close to hit something or someone. The potato pellets do not hurt."
4,"Pretty li'l cups, but order with caution...","These espresso cups are quite pretty. In fact there's nothing bad I can say about the product itself... If you like the look of these demitasses in the pictures, you will most assuredly find the set appealing.The problem though (and this is a big problem) is Mikasa's packaging. It's absolutely terrible. There is NO shipping material inside the box or around any of the items. Everything just sits on a raised piece of cardboard with receptacles cut into this ""shelf"" for each piece and thats it.I received my set and upon opening it, not only was some of the interior packaging damaged, but over half of the items were chipped or outright broken.Now maybe my box got dropped or something out of the ordinary, but packaging delicate, relatively expensive products in this way is lame, IMO.I suggest you pick these up at a local Mikasa store if you really like them."
1,Serious Design Flaw,"If you only use your cordless tool occasionally, you should probably NOT purchase this charger. This charger will NOT charge a completely dead battery. According to Milwaukee Tools tech service, the battery must have ~3V of remaining charge in order for this charger to charge the battery. IF THE BATTERY VOLTAGE IS BELOW ~3V, THIS CHARGER WILL NOT CHARGE THE BATTERY.This is probably not an issue for somebody who uses their tools often, but if you are an occasional user (less than once per month), it is a real pain. If you have 18V batteries, buy theMilwaukee 48-59-2818 18-Volt to 28-Volt Lithium-Ion and NiCad Slide Style 1-Hour Battery Charger. It's cheaper and it WILL charge completely dead batteries."
3,Milwaukee 48-59-0255 Universal AC Charger,works but not well - indicator for charge complete hard to read - made now in China so not surprizing
5,Charger,The charger worked just like the one that came with the drill. Also received it in just a couple days.
5,"Milwaukee Ni-Cad, 12-18 volt battery charger","The item arrived on time and performed as expected. I keep it in my shop, plugged in so it is ready to accept battery to charge any time."
5,Women's Organization,"Our women's organization had received no publicity for ten years. Then obtained a copy of WRITING EFFECTIVE NEWS RELEASES and followed the suggestions in the book. Every news release we have sent in since has resulted in newspaper pieces on our group. Even inexperienced people can understand how to write a good news release,because there are so many good examples to follow. Anyone who wants to get publicity should be able to benefit by getting this book."
4,Very Useful,McIntyre hits the nail on the head witn this one. I've found that my organization's releases have received much higher usage now that we follow her format. We also use Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired because of its strength in updating public rlations techniques to the Internet.
2,Writing Effective News Releases...,There is a lot of fluff and un-necessary information here just for the sake of filling pages. If you manage to go through all the fluff there are some good info as well.
2,"It's not bad, but it's not good",Tbis is helpful for about five minutes. Then you realize that most of this information is more up to date and available online for free.
3,great performances ruined by conductor,"This recording should be purchased for the Mayorga and Galladoro performances...only. Mr. Richman, the conductor, grunts and hums (ala Toscannini for RCA Victor), on litterally every musical phrase. It is unneccessary, unprofessional and a severe distraction. No one can say that using contemporary electronics at the mixing board this could not have been avoided....move the mike, move the conductor or TELL HIM TO SHUT UP!!Buyers, purchase the Mississippi and Grand Canyon Suites elsewere. There are dozens of other, equally good performances where one does not have to listen to Mr. Richman hum along."
3,Strange,Very strange film. Seems disjointed and wanders a good bit. I wasn't sure where I was in the film when the movie ended. Seems to be a series of vignettes strung together. What happened to all the characters?
3,vivid by liz claiborne body lotion,"Vivid is a very good product from past experiences. However, with a recent purchase, the fragranceseems to be fleeting. It seemed to lack something that makes the fragrance long lasting."
5,Debunking the JFK Blame Game,"In our business there is an awful lot of hand-wringing about the good old days when all well-dressed men wore hats. Hatters opine and whine about President Kennedy's refusal to wear hats resulting in a devastating effect on the industry. Neil Steinberg in Hatless JACK sets the record straight and debunks the assumption that JFK ruined the hat business. Instead, Steinberg places Kennedy's aversion to hats in the context of a trend in hatlessness that had been gaining momentum since the turn of the previous century. This is a well-researched and entertaining book, full of information and anecdotes pertaining to the historical importance of hats in American culture. Hatless JACK: The President, the Fedora, and the History of an American Style gives ever-more credence to what hat people understand - a hat is not just another article of apparel."
5,Excellent,"This is just what I was looking for to study up on my scales and modes. It's right to the point, good diagrams, shows all positions on the neck in easy to read diagrams. Just enough theory to make it practical and good examples of licks using each scale/mode. Best book I've found on scales on modes."
3,One Video Broken,"One of the videos was broken and unuseable when I opened the box. (It would have been helpful if the carton was marked ""Fragile."") I decided to keep all of the videos, thinking that it wouldn't be possible to return just one, and I needed the blank videos right away. Considering the fairly-low price, it was still a pretty good deal."
2,not so good,There were 12 in the package. 2 did not work to began with they refused to move. The tape was stuck. In the middle of the tape. The ones that worked do not last very long. They start jerking and do not track correctly. Used to get VSH tapes and they lasted a long time. Now lucky if they last anytime at all. These were better than the other brands that I bought around the same time.
2,Diapointed,"I have beern using Fuji tapes for over 25 years, only one I would buy for all my recording, so I just thought I'd have the same nice experience but was wrong, 4 of the tapes wouldn't even work when put in, and 2 others only taped 5 and a half hours instead of 6, have no idea why this happened."
5,Very usefully in it;s time range !,"A BUDDHIST BIBLIOGRAPHY -- BY SHINSHO HANAYAMAA VERY USEFULL BOOK ON IT'S SUBJECT MATTER. IN IT,S TIME RANGE, IT IS EXTENSIVE. IT WAS WRITTEN BY A VERY HIGHLY REGARDED ACADEMIC, SCHOLAR & LEADING SHIN BUDDHIST, WHO LATER BECAME A BISHOP OF THE SHIN BUDDHIST CHURCH. THAT IS A VERY HIGH MARK OF RESPECT & HONOUR FROM HIS PEERS AND THOSE OVER HIM. THIS,IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE RULES OF THE SOCIETY ARE VERY OLD,ENDURING & FIRMLY ENTRENCHED !"
5,The Master In Pure Distilled Form,"I absolutely love this CD!! Doc Watson was the finest flatpicking guitarist that ever lived. This CD is a collection of solo recordings ... just Doc's voice and guitar.The magic of Doc is that, within the simple structure of folk and bluegrass music, he weaves in so many fills and runs on his guitar. Its really quite amazing. If you've learned to play guitar (I took lessons for a few years), you can't help but be in awe over how complex, light and clean his playing is.I had the pleasure of seeing Doc live several times. My guitar teacher urged me to see him whenever he was in the area, and I'm so glad I did. He was a legend !!"
3,"She loves me, she loves me not","Scorpion is one of those stories where the characters (good and bad) are all interconnected and intermixed as to be improbable.One of the book's tensions is between the a DEA analyst who is assigned to protect the PM of Trinidad, and the US Ambassador's daughter, who is a master assassin. They also happened to be best buds growing up together.Then there is a Texas Sheriff, who is real crooked, leaves a string of dead bodies behind, flies to Trinidad to catch up to a wife he really doesn't like.I think the book's basic idea is okay, but the characters and the pacing just didn't work for me."
5,So sorry I missed her,"Like many I am sure, I am so sorry I missed her when she was here with us making her beautiful music. This CD gives everyone an opportunity to spend an hour with her. She talks about her guitar and auto harp playing and the making of her music. The sound of her voice and her laughter is enjoyed here as much as the music she makes for us. She does them all here....""Gold Watch and Chain"", ""Wildwood Flower"" and ""Fair and Tender Ladies"" just to name a few. The fact that she was also a fine guitar and auto harp player as well as a singer is driven home with each selection. This is definately ""The"" must have for Maybelle Carter fans!"
2,Disappointed with Authors veiw of intended Audience,"You can tell while reading this book that Mr. Els is very pleased with himself and it is quite apparent that he has a low regard for amateurs and club level players (his intended audience!). I got frustrated reading how the reader probably didn't have time, didn't practice a particular shot or 99 out of 100 times would do something wrong. There are better ways to teach people then constant criticism and comparison to ""the Pros"" or himself. On the other hand the photography was outstanding, I learned more viewing the pics then reading the content."
3,"Some good, some bad","This heating pad is a great size, washable and has a decent length cord.My complaints:I can't feel whether it's on high, med, low in the dark (at night). I must look at the control in order to make sure it's off.So far, it seems like there is only one temperature. The lowest setting is fairly hot."
4,Sunbeam heating pad,"The heating pad has more padding and is more comfortable than my old heating pad which was just a plastic heating pad in a pillow case type cover. You don't have to worry about a cover with this heating pad. But, this pad doesn't get as hot as my old heating pad, you need to me laying on it to get the full warm from the high setting. You can't just simply lay it on top of you, it has to be covered with something in order to get it nice and hot. Other than that it is perfect, the size is also very nice. I would buy the same one if I had it to do all over again."
1,Lasted almost two weeks,"I loved this heating pad for as long as it lasted: almost two weeks. The perfect gift, it warmed my feet well. Sadly, now it will not turn on. I didn't sit on it or get it wet. Actually, it barely moved. Since I'm not the only one with a busted product, I'm guessing they don't have good quality control. I recommend looking elsewhere for your heating pad needs."
1,The worst heating pad I've ever had,"This is the worst heating pad I've ever used. I bought this a few months ago, and from the beginning I had problems with it. It would turn itself off. I'm not talking about the auto shut off either. I'm talking as if a switch was flipped. It would blink the high heat indicator at me. I would have to unplug it for it to reset itself. At the end of my patience, I would unplug it and try again and it wouldn't reset at all. It wouldn't turn on at all, or turn on and shut off after about 5 minutes. It didn't matter what heat setting it was on either. I've had a lot of heating pads over the years and this was the biggest waste of money. I'll never buy one like this again!"
2,Bad christmas present,"I bought this for my mom for christmas and it lasted 2 days. Im not sure why it broke the directions say do not sit on... and thats ridiculous because then its not a heating pad its a tiny heating blanket. It worked well while it was in use, it was nice and warm and would definatley help with aches and pains assuming it lasts for more than 45 minutes."
2,Not hot enough,"I bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - So I thought one of them might actually be hot. Instead, the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot. This may be a ""lawsuit friendly"" reality with heating pads today - I've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago (I had that one for 10+ years, the Sunbeam replacement I bought prior to this one lasted 2 and wasn't hot)."
1,Sunbeam should recall this product.,"The previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct. The description of this product is a misnomer. The heating pad never heats up, and takes forever to just warm up. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a zero! Don't waste your money on this. I will be returning mine."
1,broke in less than 2 weeks,"My husband purchased this heating pad for me. I have neck problems and needed a new heating pad. First its takes forever to warm up then it would shut off for no reason. After about two weeks, it would not turn on any longer. This is the worst heating pad that I have ever used......."
5,loved it,love love love this heating pad...auto turn off is a great feature...4 settings ...the only flaw is that the control thing is pretty big...other than that its great......
4,"Very sharp, but it's a bit small","This knife is well designed, very sharp and the blade spring action is very nice if you have only one hand free. The small safety guard prevents it from opening in your pocket, which considering the razor sharp blade is necessary if you like 5 fingers on both hands. The locking mechanism that prevents it from closing in use is secure but a little clumsy to disengage when closing the blade and involves a careful maneuver as opposed to knives that have a push mechanism on it's spine. The knife is great to put in the small change pocket of jeans, but it is a tad small. Also, I think the removable side clip makes the small knife awkward and uneven to handle, so mine was removed, though that's a matter of personal preference. I'm not a knife aficionado, but for a small always with you knife that holds a razor edge and can be opened with one hand, it's a keeper."
5,my favorite knife ever,I carry a knife and for the last several years it has been this one. It's just lerge enough to be usefull and just small enough to carry unobtrusively. I always have two on hand in case I misplace one.
3,Not quite what I expected.,"After buying a Kershaw Blur which I was absolutely impressed with, I thought I'd give this smaller knife a try. First off, it doesn't open the same way using the knob on the blade. You have to depress the bump on the backside to flip it open. Of course, you have to unlock the safety first. So maybe just don't use the safety? Well, sometimes it engages itself so you don't really have that option.As others have stated, you can remove the safety pretty easily, but then if you carry it in your pocket it randomly opens half way due to the the bump on the back of the blade. I just keep it on my desk now, as it is a good knife otherwise. I just would not recommend carrying it in your pocket."
3,"small knife, small review","I use alot of review info to make buying choices, thought it is time give back a little. I like Kershaw knives, I bought a black blur and two chives at the same time. Upon receiving the Chives and trying them out, the choice was made to return them. The knife is just to small for any practical use, also the speed safe didn't work , the blade never fully opened. This probably could have been adjusted, but due to the size issue, wasn't worth my time. Keeping the blur, very nice and blade opens just right."
4,Great little knife,"I like it. It's smaller than I would have liked, but that's not why I gave it 4 stars. Perfect for small tasks, like opening more boxes from Amazon. :-)The lettering started to rub off almost immediately, which was weird, and why I gave it 4 instead of 5..."
5,Great knife,I have to say that this knife is amazing quality. I have been using this knife for what will be 10 years in April. I put this through heavy abuse everyday and it has held up just great. Even though I've had it for ten years and never oiled it once the thing still pops open at a seconds notice with a blade that is razor sharp. From stripping wires to opening cans this thing does it all and I am extremely pleased with its performance. This knife undoubtedly wins and gets fave stars for everything.
5,Great knife,"A few years ago, I started carrying a knife everyday. For my job, I wear dress pants and the few knives I had were to noticeable in them. I searched for a suitable replacement and came across the chive. It was exactly what I was looking for. With the clip taken off, the knife is very thin. With the blad closed, the knife can fit in the palm of my hand. It has been the perfect knife while I am at work.The fast opening is really cool. I do keep the blade locked since I normally carry it at the bottom of my pocket instead of clipped. The blade was nice and sharp and has proven to be a worthy knife in my typical day.If you are looking for a small thin quality knife, you owe it to yourself to check out the chive!"
5,My little EDC. <3,"I couldn't be happier to have gotten this knife. First of all, it looks awesome, sleek and understated, classy but functional. Sharp as heck. The spring assisted release is so convenient and cool to play with, and the frame lock is solid, and one handed closing and opening is a cinch. I'm 5'0"", with tiny hands, so this thing is absolutely perfect for me. While clipped into my pocket, I can still slide my hand in and out without it catching or rubbing against any rough edges of the knife since it's very smooth. I can almost get by with keeping this thing with me when I'm in office work clothes because it matches my watch, definitely a plus. For every day carry, this knife comes in very handy. I wouldn't take it camping though, as it is too small and more of a civilized city knife. And it's Made in USA! Probably 50% why I bought it over the other knives out there."
5,love it,"This is my second Kershaw Speed Safe Ken Onion Chive (lost first one at airport and immediately bought another). Plastic lock on first was easily disengaged and blade has opened in pocket a few times...not too cool. Also, I never use the thumb stud...knife is too small to feel comfortable doing so. But the blade is easily opened with protrusion in back with the index finger, fits/clips easily in/on pocket without me feeling like I'm carrying a huge hunting knife, and provides the utility I often need/desire out of a pocket knife."
5,knife,I really like the feel of this knife. Opens easily and closes the same.Would recommend this to others as a good working knife.
2,Your Childhood Lincoln Logs -- NOT,"I was excited to order this toy for my daughter, nostalgic to play what I loved as a child. I was in for a big disappointment. The box claims that there are 102 pieces--around half of these ""pieces"" are cheap little clumps of Chinese plastic that are supposed to be Cowboys and Indians but are hardly recognizable. As for the logs themselves, they are adequate, but the groove cuts are not consistent (the pieces do not hold together firmly) and hence the built structure is quite flimsy. There are only 4 longer pieces--for the base and the roof--so your entire structure has to consist of doors and windows. There is essentially only one kind of house you can build with so few pieces--little room for creativity. A big disappointment."
1,good research; disappointing film,"I had high hopes for this film but was disappointed by many elements of it. The research seems to be thorough, at least about the actual history of the battle. The graphics are elementary and unattractive. Many clips of sea battles seem to include ships that have little to do with the period, and the editing is inconsistent and disjointed. The characters are limited to a few and at least two of the actors' portrayals are dreadful -- flat and boring. I am very sorry I wasted my money on this film."
5,"great springboard, clean layouts","I recieved this book as a gift and have been really enjoying it. (scrapspeak, it's on my bedside table) The concept of providing numerous ideas with different options is GREAT to use as inspiration or a springboard for additional works of art. I am primarily a scrapbooker but also do a fair bit of ""other paper art"" and found lots of ideas for that too. The layouts are clean and organized and it is obvious that the author ""gets"" what scrapbookers are looking for. I have been scrapbooking for 9 years and teaching for a good part of that and still found some new perspective. If the person who criticized the book doesn't scrapbook, maybe it is possible than that she is not qualified to call the layouts tacky. My $.02."
1,Deceptive Title,"In the title of the book, it leads you to believe that there are projects with altered books and collage. After reviewing the book, all I saw were projects for scrapbookers. Very disappointing."
5,Secrets,Great and easy to use with full sized templates. The instructions are clear with excellent photos. Definitely worth the money.
1,Deceptive Title,"The title suggests interesting ideas for bookmakers. What a disappointment!The ""Pullout"" is just an accordion. ""Hiding places"" are just envelopes or flaps you open. There are no new ideas in the book. If you want new ideas, inspiration or good directions, skip this book."
5,Great resource!,I found this book a goldmine of well-presented good ideas. Excellent explanations and materials lists.
3,not as good as i dreamed of...,"I expected that i would find more staff in this book, but most of the ideas in the book are simple and pretty the same with each other"
3,Weakest in the series,"While I am a fan of the Ultimate Spiderman series, this is the weakest trade paperback I've read yet. The story with Wolverine is an interesting premise but sloppily resolved. The stories with the Human Torch and Doctor Strange are a little better but not up to the high level of this series. I applaud the creators for diverting from the standard Spiderman vs. supervillian plot but ultimately did not enjoy reading this as much as the others. Recommended for completists only."
2,SPIDEY'S SO-SO SUPERSTAR CROSSOVERS!,"I'm a huge fan of Bendis and Bagley's work on the Ultimate Spider-Man books. Even their weak stories are better than 99.9% of the rest of the comic marketplace.That said, this is a collection of pretty weak stories.Each two-issue ""chapter"" seems to be to simply help promote other titles or characters in the Ultimate Universe. X-Men (mainly Wolverine...OF COURSE), The Fantastic Four (mainly the Torch), and the Ultimates (with a huge cameo by Dr. Strange) all show up in stories that you'll forget faster than your Boss' Birthday.Save your money and buy other titles in the Ultimate Spider-Man TPB series, you'll have a better time there."
5,One of Lucinda's Best,I was shocked to see hardly any reviews for Sweet Old World. This is one of her best albums and in my opinion just as good as Car Wheels on A Gravel Road. Not a bad song on the album. Any fan of Lucinda will not be disappointed.
5,Not Her Best but Still Wonderful,"While some of the songwriting is not quite up to the standard of the masterpieces that preceded and followed it, this CD is still a wonderful recording. The title track is possibly Lucinda's loveliest and most touching song and worth the price of the disc all by itself, and there's lots of other great music here as well. Everything is beautifully sung."
4,West is still the best,"After listening Lucinda Williams' album West I became an instant fan and bought a couple of more CDs right away.Car Wheels on a Gravel Road was nearly as good as West but somehow Sweet Old World appeared to be a bit too easy peace from an artist with this kind of talent. Lucinda Williams can do better.Don't get me wrong. Sweet Old World is not a poor album. On the contrary. But many of the songs are just beautiful ""traditional"" tracks without the soul tearing spices of songs on album West.This was good but West is still the best."
2,ugh.,"looks like someone at the record company (in close cahoots with a producer or two, probably) had the ""brilliant"" notion to turn the author of 1988's best album (Lucinda Williams) into a sort of post-Stevie Nicks pre-Sheryl Crow type of middle-of-the-road-rootsy-sorta-country type gal. bad idea. (but not, thankfully, fatal: witness the brilliant Car Wheels on a Gravel Road -- the best album of 1998)."
4,Totally underrated!,"While the critics were going goo-goo ga-ga over ""Car Wheels On A Gravel Road,"" and desevedly so, it was hard not to notice that this overlooked album is a much better listen in the long run. Not as obvious as Car Wheels, it sort of sneaks up on you like a slow burning fuse and finally explodes with emotion and Lucinda's somewhat understated delivery of a fabulous bunch of songs. Songs like ""Sweet Old World"" and ""Little Angel Little Brother"" just don't come arou d every day, and the entire album is up to that standard. Is it country? Sure, but you need not be a country fan to enjoy it. Is it folk? Absolutely. Rock and Roll? Without a doubt. But mostly, it's blues, although not in the traditional sense. It just gives you that same feeling you get after listening to some great blues tunes, yet with a stronger sense of melody. If you like any of Lucinda's work, or are looking for a good introduction, you can't go wrong with this totally underrated release."
5,Resolving conflict,"I got a lot from this booklet. It's not very large, but the concepts presented are astounding - it's like someone pulled the smokescreen off the REASON for problems between people, and boiled it down to a few unshakable truths.If you have ever lost a friend or a relationship and didn't quite know what went wrong, I think you will find this booklet very, very interesting!It also gives a step-by-step handling for recovering troubled relationships, and I tried this out and I can attest it actually does work."
1,Bummer Bath Toy,"This toy looked great but in the REAL world of play was lousy. The suction cups dont hold it up in the tub, so it just slides down the wall. None of the ""options"" worked (i.e. bubbles won't come out of hippos mouth). If I could find a way to return it, I would!Dont waste your $$$!"
1,Dont buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!,BIG waste of money!!!!!! suctions cup dont hold the toy!I would give it a no star if a could!!!!!!!!!!
1,This bath toy is a RIP-OFF!!!,"save your money and don't buy this piece of junk. I fully agree with the other moms about the suction cups not sticking to the bath tub. Toy is heavy to land on the legs or toes of your little one and I had to stop it from doing that a lot. I got the hippo to blow bubbles once and it was fun while it lasted. When it was bath time again, the hippo didn't work. I finally took the toy out of the tub and tossed it in the trash."
2,Biased and boring,"I am currently a teaching assistant at a large university and I find this book to be both biased and boring. I tend to be more socially liberal, however, I believe students should be given both sides of an issue and then be allowed to draw their own conclusions. This book does not allow students to do that, and tends to only discuss the liberal sides of all social problems. Also, the book is a slow and boring read. I had a difficult time managing to stay awake while reading, so I can hardly imagine how a first-year student (who isn't getting paid) can do it. On a positive note, the text does include discussion on disabilities, which other textbooks tend to neglect. I would recommend a different text, such as Macionis or Henslin."
1,"Inaccurate, Biased and Misleading","This book is, simply put, horrible. It should not be considered a text book. Any professor using this text should really reconsider whether their interest lies in teaching facts and sharing information, or rather, if their true interest is in spreading their own politcal beliefs.This teaches students that all corporations are bad, that all people earning beyond the poverty level are bad, that home ownership is bad, etc., and that everything unfortunate in our world is caused by the greedy who dare to have more than others. It even refers to illegal activities as the ""informal economy"" throughout the book.I hope that any students taking a course with this text assigned really question what they read in the book and also question the things their professor tells them. Don't just accept the things you're told as truth - regardless of the source."
1,A book that preaches instead of teaches.,"While this book tries to give an ""accurate"" portrayal of the problems in America, not only does it go beyond US problems, it also skews information, statistical fact, and anything else they can slant to make a socialist regime the ultimate choice. The book is poorly written, with contradicting statements that run a gamut in not only chapters but single paragraphs.This book breeds un-patriotic thought, refutes nationalism, patronizes many serious issues, and uses sociology as a way to bad mouth the government rather than simply raising awareness. This book was a joke and in no way helped to expand my knowledge of social issues as I spent my time muddling through their ridiculous statements."
3,Good ideas...but something missing,"The book deals with the concept of customer service in 6 important companies through the description of what each of the companies does, told by the executives themselves.There are many good ideas and rules that can be applied to any business and that will translate in an improvement in customer service.On the other hand, as each of the procedures and systems are described by the people participating in them, I feel it is a parcial story. We have only the good side, the benefits and the final stages. What I miss is the process to reach the actual situation.If I would like to implement some of the ideas presented in the book, what would be the problems I might face ? We can also learn from the failures that these companies surely had when implementing their systems."
3,Wonderful!,It was wonderful!Just like the little kid says before the first song plays on the new Internation Superhits Green Day cd. I really enjoyed it and I think that you will too. It's a book for people who speak their mind just like me.
4,Aerogarden Shelves,Great idea but you need to provide significantly stronger/longer wall screws. I used the ones provided and it immediately pulled loose. Reattached with better hardware and have not had a problem since.
2,We like to party!,"This is a nice Eurod-Dance -song. , a catchy tune. not as good as for instance ""Boom boom boom booom"" but still good. But the Remixes are nothing but horrible. Especially # 6."
5,"One word, Awesome!","There is only one word that can describe this cd, awesome. I listen to this all day and night and all I can say is awesome!!!!"
4,it is what it is...,Universal pre-run - good enough for lights not a bad look on my cruiser- not a punnishible pre runner bumper - you will have to build that yourself.....however good for the price- nice finnish - everybody seems to like it
4,Two Brits and an American,"This is a modest collection of Uranian poetry written by three poets who were discussed by Timothy d'Arch Smith in ""Love in Earnest"" (1970). He made the mistake of thinking that Wright was British, when in fact he was American. This mistake seems to account for his being included here."
1,Too much blab not enough substance,"Sorry, but I was extremely disappointed by this book. The title is misleading. It's more of an motivational guide for high-schoolers which could have been condensed into a single page. With one exception, the sample screen play excerpts were intructive as to format layout and purpose, but otherwise those too could have been reduced to 3 or 4 pages. The book itself is portable... but I wouldn't pass it on."
5,Perfect for Beginners,"This book is perfect for beginners. That's pretty much it. If you are aspiring to be a filmmaker, definitely get this book."
3,"Good, but not very dynamic","Intrigued by the look and feel of the book, and by a few of the essay titles and their authors, I purchased this book. I was hoping for an enjoyable collection of personal observations on Lewis' life, illuminating his character and how he lived out what he believed. There was a fair deal of this sort of thing in the book, but not near so much as I had hoped, and a lot had been said before, or wasn't even all that fascinating.Overall, I enjoyed this read for the happy moments when I learned something new or charming, but other books on Lewis have been much more substantial and endearing than this one. I particularly recommend Terry Glaspey's biography of Lewis: _Not a Tame Lion_."
3,Cotton candy,"Not bad, but if you were really looking for some real knowledge of Lewis' teaching style this isn't it...it's pleasant reading, but not terribly informative. Also, it does not show the complete Lewis character. Based on sources at Oxford, the real C.S. Lewis was impersonal (even by British academic standards) with some of his students, and could be withering to those whom he felt were not terribly bright or motivated."
1,European Construction costs,"This book is so out of date, it is virtually useless. It does not list up to date currency, which is by now for several years the Euro, therefore impossible to use. For example, how do you convert Belgian Franks to Euros, when Belgian Franks do not exist anymore????"
1,Out of date,"This book lists costs in now defunct currencies. It makes you wonder if the data is current. Aside from that, the data is far too vague to provide any substantive costing."
3,Fits the bill,This is a bit difficult to review because I bought this for someone on their request. He is an accomplished guitarist so he should know his stuff. I haven't heard any complaints from him so I figure that he is happy with his purchase. It seemed like a good book when I scanned it and the spiral binding is a major plus.
1,Inaccurate and outdated,"I got this guide after skimming it pretty extensively at a bookstore. I was impressed by the content, the nice user friendly format, and the graphics quality.When I actually tried to use the information in the guide, however, I was deeply disappointed and angered, because (1) much of the information is hugely outdated even though the guide claims to be updated - for example, a restaurant that has been closed since 2001 is still highlighted in the guide in several places - tells you how dated the ""best of"" opinions written by local Napa luminaries are... and (2) the author and publisher didn't bother to verify that phone numbers were accurate, so I wound up calling wrong numbers, dead numbers, numbers for business offices of wineries only to find that I should have called the tasting room number, which these guys didn't bother to include...in short, don't buy this book! judge this book by its ""cover"" and you will be fooled and disappointed."
2,2002 and so out of date!,"Richard needs to get back in the Wine Country and find out what is going on out here. I live in the Napa Valley, and he is reviewing restaurants, hotels, store etc...that are long gone.Nothing worse at showing up at Livefire or The Diner and no one is home. Furthermore all the missed opportunities to sample hotels such as Milliken Creek Inn in Napa or Zuzu, Julias Kitchen, the Martini House, Roux... the list is endless. Life is moving fast and relying on your 1998 visit isn't cutting it."
3,Helpful for planning but a little outdated!,"This guide is very comprehensive-- great to help plan a trip to Wine Country. It gave us the scoop on activities, wineries, hotels, restaurants, etc. The maps are also good. The disappointment came when we tried to find dinner our first night in wine country. We literally went to 3 restaurants in a row that were recommended by the guide but were no longer in business. We wasted a lot of time driving around to find these places. In the end, we did find our 4th choice restaurant in town, and it was an excellent dinner. Moral of the story-- great guide, but can't hurt to call ahead!"
5,Wonderful movie!,I love the Fairies! They are very sweet and my daughter will pop up and start dancing along with them! In the Christmas Wishes movie the Fairies and their friends sing beautiful Christmas carols including some carols I hadn't heard in a long time. The Fairies are absolutely G-rated and totally mom-approved!
4,a pretty good new metal/hardcore band,"This is the first CD from World of Hurt, a metal/hardcore band from Detroit. I was led to it by the booklet for Mankind by Factory 81. Try to get some MP3s of the music before you buy, although they might be difficult to find"
4,Good Gate but not for climbers,"I do like the gate and it did work great for our daughter and pets. We installed the gate higher so our pets could crawl under the gate. Once our daughter turn 17 months she found out she could crawl under the gate, my husband put pieces of wood on each side so there was just enough room for the cats. Now our daughter has found out you can climb the gate, she has almost figured out how to get over the gate completely. If you do not have a climber, it would work perfect for you."
2,Not even good enough for most pets :(,"I read the reviews and thought...hoped this product would be adequate for my simple needs: holding back a handicapped housecat. Well, it can do that, however it is remarkably weak and poorly designed. I had low expectations for the price and was willing to take the chance, but in hindsight I would have paid twice as much for something twice as strong and more secure in closing and opening. Really...I don't see this gate holding back a rambunctious cockerspaniel let alone a toddler. To say I would not trust this at the top of a stair for a child would be an epic understatement! I'm sorry...wish I had a kind word here, but if I owned the company I'd rename and remarket this as an ""economy small pet gate."""
1,Garbage,"This gate is garbage, too much hassle locking/unlocking. Better off to buy a tension lock gate, just as cheap and easier to lock."
3,"good value, not for daily use","I bought this for a rarely-used staircase on the deck. It works, although if I had to go in and out of it frequently I'd be upset. I am happy with this purchase because it is a good value and meets our needs."
5,Serves the purpose,"I bought this gate since i have a stairway enrance that is irregular so obviously i cannot fit anything that is straight. To say the less there are no flexigates available (not that i know of anyways). So a swing gate is all i could put to use. This one was the one with lowest price. I would not call it cheap though, I would call it REASONABLY PRICED. It is sturdy, elegant, serves the purpose and is easily installed. As i mentioned that the other side of the stairway being uneven, all i did was secure the free side of the gate to the stairs with velcrow snaps. For my 1 year old, it is impossible for her to take it off and speed up and its a peace of mind for us."
2,Not What I Expected,"Maybe I just read the description wrong, but this is not a gate that you want to swing open and closed all the time to walk though. It does open, but it is not easy. It also comes off the hinges very easily. As a gate that you step over but that you can remove easily it would work, but as a gate that opens to walk though this is not what you want."
1,Not the gate in the picture,"I ordered this gate and received it the following day! Unfortunately, I did not receive the gate that is shown in the picture. The product name and number match, but the product itself is different. It would not be easy to open and close this gate with my 9 month old in my arms, so I will be returning it."
1,WORST GATES IN THE WORLD,"My husband bought three of these gates for the stairs in our house and I swear that I curse their extremely frustrating design at least 50 times per day. They are cheap, ugly, flimsy and impossible to open and close - particularly when you have a squirmy toddler in your arms. These might be OK for a grandparent's house or for very temporary use, but if you will be using these multiple times per day for the next several years - just bite the bullet and buy some attractive, quality, functional ones. The latch on these makes me want to either rip them off of the wall or rip my hair out. They were difficult to install and will leave big holes in our gorgeous banisters once removed. There is a reason these only cost 14.00. You get what you pay for. Or in this case, you get even less than you pay for. I only gave them one star because Amazon won't let you give something no stars. I hate them. I hate them. I hate them."
3,Stairway gate,"It's an alright gate. It's really flimsy, but I purchased it based on price. So I suppose you get what you pay for. I was also surprised when it came that it had to be mounted to the doorway with screws."
2,Hard to open and close,Easy to install. Difficult to open and close. Hard to get the pegs/pens in the spot to secure gate.
3,flimsy mounting,it was cheapestest and i got what i payed for but it will not last long from the look of latch and hinges
4,Good product,"Sometimes it is slightly difficult to get the gate to lock into place when you are trying to close it. Other than that, it's an awesome gate."
2,Poor quality,"The only pros of this product is the price. Otherwise, it's of very poor quality(even given the price). It's bending if you push a little. But the worst is its lock- because whole gate is shaky and bendy, locking and unlocking the door is a pain!"
5,Good gate for a great price!,"We bought this gate because we have 2 cats and just added a puppy into the mix. The poor kitties were being terrorized by the puppy so we wanted to get a baby gate for the landing of our stairs so they could at least retreat to the downstairs. It works really well and the mounting actually has a very good hold on the wall. It is also very easy to open and close, which is nice since I don't exactly like jumping over the gate a million times a day! Would definitely recommend this gate if you're just looking for something very simple and basic."
4,North States Stairway Gate,"Great gate for the top of the stairs...once I designed and built a mounting frame for the top of the stairs, the gate was quickly installed/attached. Product arrived as expected. If I needed an additional gate, I would reorder from this company."
1,returned it,We returned this gate. It opened very awkwardly. Was not worth drilling holes in the wall for. If you want a gate please invest in a more expensive one. You pay for what you get with this.
4,Good quality; great value,"For $13.50 from Amazon, you can't beat this item. It's made almost entirely of plastic, but it's plenty sturdy to keep a toddler from breaking through it.You should be aware that this is designed to attach to a *flat* wood or drywall surface on both sides. (If drywall, I'd highly recommend you pick up some anchors, since this doesn't come with any.) I managed to attach it to our metal stair railing by securing a 1x3 to a post with U-bolts and screwing the brackets into the 1x3.It is not the easiest to latch or unlatch, so I would not necessarily recommend it for a high-traffic area."
3,It's not a bad gate for the price,"This isn't as great a deal as I first thought. It's hard to unlatch once it's locked and we have three older children so it's kind of a pain to have to help them open the gate all the time. Also the part that the hinge is on isn't actually mounted to the wall. It rests on a mount but you can literally just lift it up off the mount. So in our house if you're not wrestling to unlock it, you're wrestling with having to remount the entire gate. Also, the gate is about three inches taller that other gates which means you can't just step over it, you have to unlock it to get by. Overall I wouldn't purchase this gate unless you were going to use it to block off an area that you just don't use that much."
5,10 Rules for Strategic Innovators: From Idea to Execution review,"The authors use relevant and engaging examples to conduct comparison against their rules as laid out in the text which easily draws you in. It is a very easy read and breaks away from the norm by exposing the reader to the Their Focused Planning (TFP) model for Strategic Planners/Strategic innovators vice the standard business models (DDP) which many business leaders find too difficult to apply to strategic experiments. The notes in the back of the book provide some great insight into the minds of both authors and place each chapter in context to what they were thinking or going for within each. Excellent way to gather more resources or references for further self-study on the topic of strategic innovation and experiments. I would recommend this book for anyone considering careers in project management, organizational development, human performance, human resources, learning and development or management. Great book."
5,Must have for Intrepreneurs!,"Ten Rules for Strategic InnovatorsThis book is truly a guide for intrepreneurs (which are people trying to launch new products or services companies from inside their existing company). This book defines three major forces which should be managed to help a new company succeeded when launched from its parent company. The major forces are: the forgetting challenge, the borrowing challenge, and the learning challenge. Interestingly, very little existing research highlights the importance of learning in launching new business, that why I value that section of this book! Hence if you're working inside a new business unit or are an upper executive with several new business units under you, I recommend reading this book.Dr. Brian GlassmanPh.D in Innovation Management from Purdue University"
2,Rehash of old insights,"I enjoyed the war stories, but did not find any significant or new contribution to the management literature. The title says the book is about ""strategy innovation."" However, the stories seem like just regular old product innivation to me. And the framework developed looks like old fashioned organizational learning. It would be better to go back to the classics by Chris Agyris on forgeting, Peter Senge's 5th Discipline on learning, Tom Peters on excellence, innovation and chaos on ""Not invented here syndrome"" to understand borrowing. These authors originated the ideas in this book in the 1980s and 1990s, but did a more indepth job developing them. You don't need this book. It is old hat."
2,Do NOT Buy if you own an up to date PC,"I purchased this amazing Sonic title for my pc thinking I could revisit it without buying a Sega CD for my old school Genesis, boy was I wrong!This title ONLY WORKS with a Windows 95 & 98 computer, Windows XP owners and all of the above are out of luck. I boot up the game on my XP and even on a friend's laptop and I still got the same error, it complains that a file is missing or some crap. BOTTOM LINE; This game is too old to work on newer computers and I guarantee you will waste your money if you depend on it to install on a newer machine.There's only one way to play Sonic CD now for people without old computers, which is the way Sega had originally intended it to be played, on the SEGA CD."
5,Ska at it's best!!,"I've been a listener of ska for a little over a year. At first I thought these guys were crazy, but after hearing this cd, I totally changed my mind...""Blue Meanies For Ever!!"""
2,Bland and disappointing,"Despite the enticing cover and the New York setting, this bland romance barely allows us to get to know the potentially intriguing romantic foil to the main character, and thus the predictable romance and its crisis and resolution barely register as anything worth reading about."
4,Decent Replacement Lamp,"This lamp installed easy and lasted pretty long with fairly continuous use. Colors tended to fade toward the end of the lamp's life, but that's pretty commmon."
4,Armband,Armband is a little tight for average size arm but works fine. For the price is excellent...
1,Doesn't fit iPod Shuffle 4G,Armband is too wide to fit the iPod Shuffle 4th gen even with the Eforcity silicone case (which is actually pretty nice). Don't recommend buying this for the Shuffle.
3,It's okay,"I bought this and then bought the silicone case that the description says it needs. HOWEVER, I've not found a way to attach my iPOD shuffle to it except to use the clip on the ipod. The title is a bit misleading as it insinuates that the item comes with a silicone or leather case with armband slots...yeah, it doesn't. This is JUST the velcro armband. I read reviews and then read the description over a couple times to finally understand you must buy the case WITH armband slots (good luck finding one of those). Eforcity should really sell them together. It would create less confusion and actually give them a better name."
1,Disappointed,This product should be sold for children they are very small - they need to be at least 3 more inches longer. I was very disappointed with this product.
4,worked,I actually bought this to use as a safety strap for my awning on my 29 ft travel trailer. It worked good for what I needed.
2,"Does it's job, but won't last I foresee","Got this for my iRiver iHP-120. The band isn't as wide as the opening for the slot in the case, which I think is a pretty standard sized opening. Would be perfect for a Nano I suppose. So the player shifts around allot. This is a simple design. No excess cord loop or anything else.I use this primarily at the gym. Not saying I have huge arms, but this band is insufficient length for a bodybuilder. I have it hanging on by the last bit of velcro.I foresee it won;t last becuase it's already starting to loose elastic bands."
2,Not a fan,"Not compatible with all sizes iPod, nano clips to it so its completely unnecessary. Might be okay for larger iPods, but it scratches the skin."
4,It works but just,"This simple armband will hold my iPod Touch with its neoprene cover with slots in the back to my upper arm. But it should be slightly wider and for many it should be longer. I am no weightlifter so it does ""just"" fit me but if you are a fat female or male athlete this will probably be too short."
2,Too short,Circumference of this armband is little more than 10 inches long when adjusted. It will probably stretch comfortably to 11 inches. 12 inches should be maximum. It's a little bit too tight for me and I'm not a guy with really bulky arms.
4,Simple satisfaction,Arm band fits comfortably. Doesn't irritate my skin. My nano fits just fine. Would certainly reccomend and buy for friends.
5,2GB iPod,"The iPod and armband is great for running. Was able to retire the old radio I use to strap on a belt and hear stations fade in and out. I don't have to listen to music I don't like, now, just because it is the only thing I can get that is clear.Only wish I had bought the 8GB one instead of the 2GB."
1,Not what I bargained for,"I was looking for something hands free for my ipod shuffle. This product description says its for all the different ipods as long as you have the silicone skin. I did purchase one of those as well and it still does not fit. Wish I would have thought to read more reviews on it before I ordered since everyone else seems to complain about the same thing! Not happy with this purchase, totally misleading and useless for its appropriate purpose!"
1,Does't fit,I read the reviews after ordering this item. It still doesn't fit. It hasn't been corrected. Not worth the time to send it back.
2,"Aykroyd, can there BE more funny?","This piece of software reminds us of when dan ""the man"" aykroyd was actually funny. He is now lucky to get a job opening for Richard Jeni at the front of a walmart. However these classic moments of his career are captured all on once piece of software for you. My adviee being, if you like Dan buy it, if you have no affection for the 70's through 80's.....do not."
5,Boost this book,Just throwing my two cents in for yet another winner from Steve Brewer. Pick this one up. You won't regret it.
2,false advertising,I wouldn't have bought this book if I had known that Susan Hill was not the author. She wrote the introduction and selected the stories.
2,Not Very Good,The PC and Saturn Verisons of this game suck if you want this game go spend your money on the Genesis verson insted.
2,Neopoitan Songs typical,"This was a little disappointing, did not sound as good as the 78 record I'd heard as a child, I thought the audio would sound better not worse. Also, after Pavorati came along, it is hard to listen to anyone else, especially not a tenor, sing these songs. Peerce was not a tenor but does a credible job."
5,Just purrfect,"We were looking for something to add to my wifes garden, and she is a cat lover, so this was the perfect addition to a full garden. It is very durable and solid."
4,Carruth makes quality pieces,"Agreeing with another reviewer, the only reason this doesn't get five stars is the price. It is rather small, which makes it suitable for indoor or outdoor display. Other than that, the cat is very well done. This is my fourth Carruth piece, and the quality is evident in all of them. If you want to give a cat lover something that will be treasured, this is it.September 12, 2011 update: This cat has been outside since it was purchased, and it has held up to the elements perfectly. I get to see it almost every day when I'm watering my potted plants, and I really love it."
4,Turning into Roy Barcroft,"Richard Bailey didn't cut the most heroic figure among Republic's serial heroes, and his voice sounds a tad on the sissy side. But he was built like stuntman Tom Steele which is what counts, because Steele made his character look like quite a battler. Even so, heroine Linda Stirling saves the life of Bailey's criminologist character about as many times as vice versa in this exciting chapter-play, about one of a group of suspects on an island who has developed a Frankenstein-like spark-throwing transformation machine which can literally turn him into another person, the physical personification of his pirate ancestor, played by Roy Barcroft. It is said that this was one of Barcroft's favorite roles, because it was something different from western heavies. Indeed it was, and Barcroft revels in it."
1,Not for Honda Accord (08+),"I have gone through two of them and they both have exactly same issue,at least 30% of surface doesn't get sweep, I have put another brand of a wiper on the car and it works just fine.I have nothing positive to say about Silblade or their customer service quality either, my first impression after installation was that I've got a OBF so I've contacted them directly, they obviously didn't care to help me as there was no system in place implemented to deal with returns.Amazon stepped up and send me a replacement after complaint, replacement actually works the same way as the wiper I've returned so it's a design and not isolated problem, for me it was a waste of money."
1,very dissapointed!,I bought a pair for a 2000 nissan altima and installed them on a new clean windshield and the drivers side does not wipe clear.I've had better results from cheaper wipers.I called amazon and new one is on the way out.Buyer Beware!
1,These blade are Poor!,"I bought these blades because of the reviews and the materials used. I have used other expensive blade before, the best so far are Bosch Excel Micro Edge they are the only blade I have used that do not smear. The silblade smear about the worst I have ever seen. They are worse than the wall mart $2 special. It seems that they have some rainx type coating that does help shed water off the window but the problem with that is it causes the blades to leave a layer of water when wiped. I have cleaned my windows with a good window cleaner and it did help but it seems the blade put more of the rainx type stuff on the window. I live in the Seattle area and we get allot of rain I was hoping that these blades would work for at least the whole winter, most blades last about 4 months in the winter. These are some of the worst wipers I have ever used, and they cost allot!!"
2,warranty is terrible,"ordered these blades in Feb. About a month later one of the blades started tearing at the end of the blade, away from the body(flaps when the blade moves. Just got off the phone with Silblade rep, they will honor the warranty with either fax, email or snail mail submission of invoice from amazon, however they charge a 10.95 shipping and handling fee. This makes the savings over just buying a new blade for me at $6. Not what I would call standing by your product charging the customer 60% of the original price to replace a defective product. Will not buy this product again. They worked good at first but in no way will they last 5 years. The other blade has held up but it still squeals unless there is constant rain. Have had equally good wipers for half the cost."
4,You'll never go back to cheap wiper blades after these...,"I got a pair of these (a 19 inch and a 21 inch) for my wife's car in January 06 and they are virtually as clear and streak free now as they were a year ago. These seem to handle heavy rains (Houston thunderstorms) as well as can be handled. We don't get snow or ice so I can't comment on how the blades fare in freezing temperatures.I was so impressed, I had to order another pair for my car. I'd give these 5 stars if I didn't find minor problems (see below) with their design.Pros: Clear, streak free view. No chatter. Seem to last far longer than standard, cheap blades.Cons: ""Black"" color of the blade frame is not quite black. Looks more like charcoal to me. ""Silblade"" name on the blades means you have to orient these correctly (unless you do mind seeing ""edalbliS"" every time you look at the car). Plastic tab that firmly secures the blade to the arm makes the blade VERY difficult to remove."
1,Not good for winter conditions,"I purchased these wiper blades in the summer, largely because I was tired of replacing hardened rubber blades. They worked very well and I was very satisfied. However, when winter came, especially at times when anti-icing chemicals were used on the road, all these things did was smear everything around and obscure the windshield. In many cases where chemicals were not present, the wipers spread moisture in an even and thin layer all over the windshield which promptly froze. This is alarming and dangerous when traveling at highway speeds. These blades are dangerous in winter conditions! Do not buy them if you live in a climate where snow and ice are common."
4,Very good so far but....,"Everything works well.. only thing is that couple days after installation, the silicone detached from the metal frame and wiping made funny noises. I think it was because the silicone was stuck to the dry glass and when I turned on the wiper the force separated the metal frame and the silicone. I pushed them back together and haven't had problem since. Everything worked perfectly.I've had the blades for 3-4 months now. used them both in rain and with windshield fluid"
2,okay i am using them,Kinda squeek a little if there is not much rain. They don't look like what was pictured. One of the wipers was coming out of the package.
3,Did not fit.,"Bought these wiper blades to fit a Mercedes as listed in the sizing guide on both Amazon and Silblade websites. They did not fit. Called Silblade and they said they would send me replacements (different type) since the guide is not correct. There will be a charge for an upgrade. After two weeks, I called again, and after sending proof of purchase, they are sending replacements. The guide has still not been corrected as it still shows this product will fit.I gave them 3 stars for admitting the guide is wrong and eventually responding, but still have not received the blades."
4,Works allright...,"This seems to work allright, and like any new wiper blade, it does a great job. We'll see how long this lasts and if their claims of long(er) life have any substance. But as far as a new product goes, it does the job and fits my Hinda just fine."
3,Does not fit BMW e90,"Amazon says these will fit a BMW e90 series, but the post the blade slides onto is too thick for the clip to clip back in place. Nice looking blades, wish they fit."
2,came off a few times,"It works fine as a normal wiper. The silicone got detached from the metal every once in a while and the silicon hangs from the metal and makes squeaky noises. Its not a big problem since its easy to fix, its just it got annoying after a while. Other than that, everything worked just fine.(I've had the blades for 6 months now. used them both in dry weather with windshield fluid and under the rain)"
3,"Once you get it attached, it's good",This is an ok wiper although it took me forever to get it on my 2000 rav4.Had to get a friend to help me.
3,"Blades are great, but the attachment accessorys do not work well","I bought the blades about a month ago and they are really great. The only problem is that the plastic clip that holds the blades in place on the car has already broken. I have had to resort to putting some black electrical tape on the blades and see if that will keep things together. If not, I will try to return them and see what happens."
1,Special order for the correct adapter!,"I waited a month to receive the blades, now it's been going on another month to try & get the correct adapter! I don't know how good/bad they are. Wonder if I ever will!"
1,Not as described in instructions,"I just rec'd a pair of 28"" Silblades. The cost was over $40 and unless I want to throw them in the trash, I have to put them on the drill press to drill some holes so that they will fit. The directions show TWO holes drilled in the blade so that they can be used with BOTH 1/4"" and 3?16"" pins. The blades I rec'd DO NOT have any holes drilled. I am sure that drilling the holes will void my warranty but I have no choice, other than to throw them away."
1,CRAP,Ordered two wiper blades. One in the origonal package and the other thrown in loose and missing parts!!!!POOR workmenship by order pickers. They must know the item was wrong and still choose to ship it!!!!!I wish I could contact seller!!!!!!!
3,Not the Product Pictured,"The product pictured is Silblade's frameless ""Flex-blade"" wiper blade and one piece continuous frame. The product I received was the Silblade model with the regular style wiper frame like the stock wiper frames on most cars. From past experience I find the Silblade Flex-Blade model to be superior to the framed models. So I returned my Silblade to Amazon and ordered from another online retailer that was actually selling the Flex-blade. Well worth the extra couple bucks for the frameless model."
1,Doesn't fit land rover discovery 2004 despite advertisement to the contrary.,"I apparently missed the return window, but I bought these as a spare for a road trip. When I reached my destination and went to change my wiper blades they did not fit. Enjoy my $40.00 bucks!"
2,Waste of money,"Amazon ran a buy-one-get-one-free deal on these a few months back and I picked up a pair knowing I would need new wiper blades soon. They sounded great and the reviews were decent so I thought it was worth trying them out. These things are terrible. They squeak, and leave streaks on the windshield and are really annoying unless it is absolutely pouring out and then they seem to work fine. For light to average rain, they are awful. I'll be going back to my trusted Rain-X blades very soon."
5,Amazing Wiper,I bought this item along with another lower-end/cheaper blade as replacements for the two of my current blades on my 2002 Grand Cherokee and I did this to see if there's a true difference and boy was I in for a treat! This wiper shoves ALL the water away and with every swipe it's as if it's not only taking the water away but softly drying it for me to see very very clearly. I bought another for the 2nd blade. A+ product so far! :)
3,Not exactly what I had in mind,"I was so sick of the ""cheap"" wiper blades that I decided to go big and spend sixteen dollars apiece for these. These blades work very well under ""normal"" conditions. If you're looking for a superblade then you may be disappointed. They still smeer muddy water, freeze up in icy weather, leave lines as they are moving and an occasional hop every now and then when just a sprinkle. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic, but I don't think they are worth the money"
2,Wrong Paint-Squeaky Clean !!!,"I'll keep this short...#1 The sun will blind you reflecting off the shiny black surface of the wiper, I don't intend to repaint them. They should have painted them with dull black paint NOT glossy shiny black. #2 If squeaky clean is hoped for, then they do this, I'd prefer a wiper that does not squeak or squeal when wiping. Bottom line is an unsatisfactory wiper, especially at this price!!!"
2,Screeches on my 2005 Honda Odyssey,"Bought the 26"" wiper based on previous reviews that it worked with the Odyssey van. Unfortunately, did not work for us. Yes, it wipes well, but only when it's pouring buckets. Cannot use the intermittent wipe function for showers or light rain as it screeches so bad, akin to nails-on-a-chalkboard sound. The upside was the noise was so irritatingly bad, it jerked my husband to attention when he started zoning out so it saved us from a potential accident, I suppose.Also, the package I got was missing the correct clip to attach to my wiper arm so had to use the one from the old blade.Sent it back to Amazon who promptly refunded."
2,Streaked in less than 6 Months,"I put these blades on my car in late October. We had a very mild winter with hardly any snow or ice. By March, the blades started streaking my windshield.Additionally, of the 6 blades that I ordered, 4 came without adapters & I had to call the company. With apologies, the company shipped the adapters, but they should have been in the package.This blade performed no better than any cheapo blade that I've purchased in the past. I cannot recommend this item."
3,Don't count on 5 year warranty,"One of the blades I received was defective, did not have any rain until 30 return policy for Amazon was up, called Amazon about warranty they referred me to Silblade web site, called Silblade they stated they DO NOT WARRANT PRODUCT have to go to seller. Thank goodness for Amazon, they stated they do not warrant product it is warranted thru manufacturer, but since it was just past 30 days, they gave me a credit which was used to order another blade, and it is ok. Bottom line if you are purchasing these blades for the 5 year warranty I would not count on it. The blades themselves do a remarkable job clearing the windshield, just don't count on any warranty from Silblade."
2,Streaks about 6 months in,"Bought these wipers during winter last year. New England had a pretty bad winter, but I didn't get a lot of snow testing out of them. However, 6 months in they were already streaking. I have not tried contacting silblade yet but may very well have to as this winter looks like it will end up just the same. Having a jeep wrangler, there's not much out there for options with wiper blades. May just go back to get oem blades from a dealer again."
3,Do not fit Subaru Tribeca 2008 (wiper arm with spoiler model),"I bought a pair for the passenger (20"") and the driver (26"") sides. I really liked the quality and kept the passenger but the one for the driver side is not wide enough and did not fit the hook on the wiper arm (I have the winshield wiper with the spoiler). The website showed that this is the model that fit my car but it does not. I returned the item for a refund."
1,Bogus deal. In the ad they buy one get one free . igot only one wiper blade. It is highly impossible for them to overlook the mi,"SILBLADE WB 122S:Silblade WB122S Premium Black Silicone Wiper Blade - 22""i ordered from daily gold box deals: it said buy one get one free. i have got only one blade. i sent a message to AMAZON. COM for correction no body replied and i did not receive the 2nd blade so far. it is difficult to deal with AMAZON. I may have to be careful what i order from them."
1,Silblade Review,"1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:1.0 out of 5 stars Silblade Wiper Review - Don't bother - Bogus Guarantee, December 3, 2007Silblade Windshield Wiper ReviewAfter a little over a year these wipers are no better than any you would get at the gas station... They are rusting, streaking, and making noise. After a call to Silblade to reconcile the ""Five Year Guarantee"" (I have my receipt), I was rudely told to contact whom ever I bought them from! Have you ever heard of a manufacturer who would have you do that?"
3,Doesn't Fit the Vehicle I Ordered It For,"I ordered these wipers for my 2008 Suburban. At the beginning of the order, it asked me the year, type, and model of my vehicle. After entering the information, it said they would fit my vehicile so I ordered it. Now our Suburban has really weird windshield wipers and they are difficult to find not to mention expensive. I received my package yesterday and lo and behold, they didn't fit. Fortunately, I was able to use them on another vehicle we own, saving me the trouble of having to ship them back.I rated it a three because of the issue above. If the company is going to sell something, they need to verify that it will fit the vehicle you've ordered it for.The wipers actually worked very well and I wish I could get some that fit my Suburban."
2,Not good,"I bought this Silblade for my car's passenger side and got a Rain-X Latitude for driver side. Compare them side by side, I found this one is not a high-end blade. First of all, it doesn't have a curve shape. Secondly, it doesn't evenly blade my window.If you ask me to pay $5-8 for this one, I may say okay. But priced around $15, it's not good. The high-end blades from Bosch, Rain-X and Valeo are all much better."
3,Not as described in listing. But good product nonetheless.,"Amazon lists this as the ""flex"" type blade. Blade received is the older style but I'm keeping it anyway.It hasn't rained since I installed the blades (10 days). Maybe that's a hidden benefit."
2,These wipers beg for attention,"I just wanted to re-iterate a couple of things people have complained about this product. First, I got the 22"" wiper blades for my GMC Envoy. Right away I did not like these blades.It leaves a film on the window. Especially while it is wiping, there will be a ""quickly disappearing"" fog trail behind the wiper blades. This is somewhat annoying since the last thing you want is for your wipers to be even more of a distraction while you are trying to drive safely in the rain.Also, the instant there is no rain on the window, it streaks sooooo loudly! I admit when it is raining it does a great job keeping the window clear. I became so anxious of the streaking sound, which reminds me of fingernails on the chalkboard, that I began manually operating my wipers."
4,Works great- if they fit,"The product itself works great and the front wipers were easy to install and the perfect size. The reason for the 4 stars is the back wiper. There was no compatible attatchment to put the wiper on, so I had to send it back. Normally I would chalk this up to my own ignorance, but the company's webstite specifically said the product would fit my car's rear window, so beware of their recommendations."
1,"Noisy, Not performing as good as I expected","I'm sorry that I bought these wiper blades-They chatter when there is light rain or a fine mist.They perform as normal in a rain storm.My Jeep sits in a heated garage most of the time, so I can rule out too mush sunshine or a corrosive environment.Save your money- get the Non silicon wipers- they don't last a long time but they are mostly quiet"
4,Good to start out...,"I have lived in Phoenix, Dallas, and San Antonio and found out one thing... no windshield wiper is going to hold up well in extreme heat. These blades are not really all that different. They were great through the first six months but started getting some of those signs of wear through the hot summer months."
2,Wish I didn't buy these,"Amazon had a buy one get one free deal, and the reviews seemed decent. Bought a pair for a Honda Odyssey and a pair for a Honda CRV. The blades for the Odyssey work just fine, wipe well, no problem. On the CRV, they were awful. I'm not sure if I got a bad set or what, but they don't completely wipe the windshield, leaving a wide strip unwiped. Plus, they make an awful screeching sound scraping against the glass. It was so bad, I just replaced them with a different brand. So, I'm not sure if it is a quality control issue or a design issue, but I wish I had never bought these wipers for the CRV."
2,Not so special,"I bought these wipers for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe in Feb 2011... as of this review (4 months later) the wipers have not held up any better (or worse) than any other wipers I've bought. They worked great for the first couple of months, like most wipers. But, now, unless I'm in a heavy/steady rain they stutter across my windshield. It is most noticeable and annoying at the slower intermittent setting."
5,Works,"It you are looking for a windshield wiper that is easy to install, lays flat on your windshield and is efficient, then look no further. I was pleased when I used them during the first rain after installing them. My windshield was wiped clean and my vision during the storm was acute."
5,I really liked this product.,"I presently drive a 2006 Ford Tauras. I purchased this product one wiper blade at a time, because I wanted to compare it with the manufactures standard wiper blade; and boy was there a big difference. The Silblade wiper was wisper quiet compared to the standard rubber blade, it thoroughly cleaned the windshield surface crystal clear, and instillation was quite simple. I researched this product on the internet before I purchased it...and everyone was so excited about this product so, I figured why not. It was worth it!"
1,Very disappointed!,These wiper blades produce a high-pitched screeching noise every time they waft past the windscreen. Like nails on a chalkboard.
2,Surf One SOLD OUT!!!,Surf One used to produce a quality product. This board looked like it came off the shelf of wal-mart. I reccomend this board for beginners.
2,A Mindless Read,"This book isn't bad enough to throw at the wall, but it's not good enough to pass along to a friend. There is no mystery involved, no surprises, and the author demonstrates a very immature sense of justice. On the other hand, the characters were likeable and the story doesn't bog down anywhere."
2,two stars for encouragement,"This book came to me highly recommended, and I really wanted to like it. I just didn't much, however. The plot idea, the killing of a twin, and then the other twin taking over her life, sounded like an interesting mystery idea. But in reality, the characters seemed really 2 dimensional -- totally unbelievable. This might be a good summer holiday book, however, if you don't expect too much. I would like to read some other items by this author -- there is potential for a good mystery writer."
1,"Read it only if you're really, really bored...","I can pretty well read anything and find something to like about it. Not so with this book! I might as well have picked up a Marvel comic. My main complaint is the characters. Douglas either has no idea of a normal human-to-human relationship or he deliberately made them unlikeable, unbelievable and unreal.What woman would not make the slightest effort to find out what happened to her husband? What mother would suddenly hear the words ""your child is dead"", have no real reaction and then concentrate on helping a woman she has never met...? Why are the only slightly fleshed-out men gay? Why is Christianity spoofed? Why is Maggie so stupid?Oh well, this is one I am sorry I read and find too unworthy to be donated to charity. Trash pile book."
2,Poor Story,"The story is NOT well-written. The plot is weak. I mean, come on. Mary's mother wouldn't be that secretive in real life, would she? Especially not to Mary's friends. Also, it's a bit unrealistic that Mary's friends jump to the conclusion that Mary was kidnapped. Wouldn't they do a little more research? Not a good Sweet Valley Twins book."
4,great text for getting to know readers!,"Sandra Wilde has taken the work of Goodman, Watson, and Burke, and made it more accessible to undergrads, graduate students, and practicing teachers alike. She walks you through the reading process, the cueing systems, misuce analysis, and instructional implications for various ""types"" of readers. I highly recommend this text to those teaching pre-service and/or practicing teachers how to get to know readers, particularly those who struggle with text."
1,If you want sleepless nights.....,"Aside from the wonderful line work in this book, the pen and ink is nice.....everything else about it is just plain CREEPY. And I am an adult.....who has been staying up well into the night with my 6 year old who won't go to sleep. And who would blame him when the description of the book is this:""Do you ever hear noises in the night? Maybe you try to tell yourself that's it's just the wind or a train going by? You're probably right. But what if it's the Flat Man squeezing himself into your room? What would you do if you couldn't keep the Flat Man from getting in?""I am huge Coraline, Neil Gaiman, Tim Burton fan. I enjoy strange, creepy, askew, twisted tales but this really isn't appropriate for under 10."
1,Nightmares,"For some reason, my daughter's school librarian thought it would be a good idea to read this book to the class. She was wrong! This is a terrible book for children. My 6 year old is having nightmares worrying that The Flat Man is coming to get her. The Flat Man does not ease childrens' fears about the dark, it creates new ones."
4,Good reference guide.,"The authors did a great job of presenting the relatively basic information on configuring Cisco routers. You will find quite a few useful IOS commands discussed in the book that will want to keep it as a handy reference. I would also suggest looking into getting ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton. That book would take you deeper into mechanics of modern routing protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP), along with a discussion of Cisco IOS commands."
1,"IT covers most about Cisco Router configuration, but...","it doesn't explain it well. I can also use TAB and ? keys in the keyboard when I'm inside Cisco Router, better than using this book. What lacks here are sample configuration in a given situation or scenario, and more explanation of the commands and command options. What this book did was give the command and command options.""Cisco Routers for IP Routing Little Black Book"" by Innokenty Rudenko is still the best handbook, combine it with ""Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration"" by Dave Hucaby, Stephen McQuerry, David Hucaby, and ""Remote Access for Cisco Network"" by Bill Burton, William Burton you are ready for the real-world task of configuring and troubleshooting Cisco Routers and Catalyst Switches."
1,Lacking in examples and reasonable exercises,"We used this text for a one semester undergraduate course in complex analysis at North Dakota State, and the entire class HATED the text. There are few exercises and they are of poor quality. The text also contains few examples, and they are often completely missing when they are most needed. I don't even consider this text as having reference value in the future. Yes, it is a condensation of Silverman's translation of Markushevich's three volume work. One might be better off with the whole book, because this edition seems to be missing a lot. Our professor finally gave up on the text and spent twice the usual time preparing his lecture notes so that we wouldn't have to open the text ever again, and I don't plan to."
5,great Complex Analysis text,"Great complex analysis text -- I will use this for teaching two semesters of complex analysis. Lots of examples and gives all the necessary theory. It explains even basic concepts in analysis and topology as needed, so the student doesn't have to look for other references. Since it is a bit old, in a very few places the terminology/notation is a little outdated. The book contains lots of exploring of the individual complex functions and at the same time all the theory I would ask for. In some places I would do the proofs a little differently -- the author is very hands-on."
5,A Must Read!!!!,This book was too much fun to read. I read it in one sitting. I laughed so hard I cried. Wanda is a true 90's woman. You cannot miss with this book.
1,Do not buy this item. It has false descriptions all over.,It is too small in size to fit on the Mac Pro (15 inch) screen.That's it folks. I opened the package and returned it right away back to Amazon.And wasted my precious hour and half dealing with this crap.
2,"Great Distributor, product..not so much","The shipping time was fast and the product came perfect, no creases or anything. Unfortunately, after many tries it does not stick so I ended up throwing it away."
3,"Okay product, but too difficult to remove air bubbles","This product works great on MACBOOK PRO 15.4 inch screens, but I found the application process to be too demanding. The seller provides a small lint cleaner to clean your screen with, but it is nearly impossible to get your screen perfectly clean unless you are in an airtight room. The problem is that any little piece of dirt/lint/dust creates little air bubbles, which are impossible to remove. I then tried cleaning the ""sticky"" side of the product, but this only smudged the plastic even worse. So, after 5 minutes, i was out $20. The thing is completely useless now. Admittedly, the problem is not with the product--it is just as promised; rather, the problem is with the installation process, which is much too difficult for the ""average"" user. If you have a clean room, which is particle free, go for it."
1,Doesn't fit my MacBook,"I have a unibody MacBook pro, 15"", and this protector didn't come anywhere close to fitting it. It was way too small. I don't know if they sent me the wrong one or what, but I'm not going to spend time waiting to see if the next one fits--I'll just get a refund."
1,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this Eforcity Premium Reusable Sceen Laptop Notebook Protector. It was important to me to protect the screen on my newly purchased 15inch macbook pro. However when I received my screen protector in the mail, it was bent and when I tried to apply it to my screen, the dents in the protector were even more noticeable in that there are now those little air bubbles all over my screen. They won't flatten out due to the dents, and I'm very unhappy that I have to continuously look at them until I can purchase another screen protector."
1,Don't bother,"This thing is crap. If you have an on screen camera, you can't use it when this is on due to it not being clear. You can't ever get all the bubbles out of this thing, therefor you can see it and it's annoying when on the computer, also, no matter how many times you try to get it on correctly, it doesn't work.I wouldn't bother spending the money on this, I wish I didn't. Did it protect the screen, yes but it was hard to get on and you could see it and you had to take it off to use your onscreen camera. Not worth it in my opinion."
1,"Not for macbook pro 15""","I can't say wether the product is easy to use or if it fulfills its purpose because it does not fit the macbook pro 15 in screen. Width wise its fabulous but it leaves a noticeable area uncovered length wise. I didn't have to take it out of the packaging to measure, totally going to hit the return button right now."
1,"DOES NOT FIT MACBOOK PRO 15""!!!",Product seems like it's decent quality but it leaves about an inch of the macbook pro's lcd screen (the video portion) uncovered!!!Go ahead and buy if you want to trim it to size for a smaller screen but just beware that this product won't function as marketed.Not a bad deal for the price (if it fits your screen) but too bad the seller/manufacturer didn't do their homework.
1,Not Worth It PERIOD!,"The description states MacBook Pro 15 inch Screen Laptop Protector....Its not the right proportion for a 15in MacBook Pro so it should not be advertised as such, even the image used for the product shows the protector actually fitting the screen. The screen I receive was labels as advertised yet the screen was only 3/4 of the length and and barely 1/2 the height. I don't know about how well it works because I wasn't going to waste time when it obviously did not fit. Though I will say the packaging was impeccable by the vendor with bubble wrap securely in box and everything for just that item so that it would not damage. But not worth the effort for this product at least so I'm returning it."
1,Pass on this one,"Warning: This product does not come with detailed instructions for proper application. I followed the instructions that were included and started noticing a few small air bubbles forming under the protector. This was caused by small particles in the air sticking to the protector. Once they're on there, there's no way to remove them. So much for this thing being reusable. You can try to push the air bubbles out with the plastic scraper that's included but this really doesn't work. I contacted the vendor and they sent a replacement when I asked for a refund. This time they also e-mailed me detailed installation instructions. However, it would be far too time consuming to install this properly and with one mistake I would have another trapped air bubble.In my opinion, this is definitely not worth the price and not worth the trouble. I only purchased this since it was part of a package deal. Otherwise, I would have never considered it. Now I'm stuck with a product I will never use."
3,even with patience impossible to get rid of airbubbles...,"i've tried many different types of screen protectors... esp for the macbook pro 15 inchers....... by far... i think this is the crappiest quality.it's just flimsy...most protectors, if you get dust on them... you usually use soap water to remove the dust and reapply it... not this one.the good thing is... air bubbles are hard to see after you turn on the display, but once the display is off.. it's the ugliest thing you'll ever see.the only reason why i gave it 3 stars is because the price is cheap... but cheap is what you get.i bought the best screen protector during my stay in Tokyo... that protector cost me 3000-4000 yen ($30-$40).... HIGHEST QUALITY... EVER. they sell it on amazon! but... expensive."
2,Didn't Fit Right,"when i applied the screen guard, it was way too big for the screen.Had to trim it down to fit the screen properly, but still doesn't fitas good as it should."
3,good product,the cover was on time. the bad thing for me is i was to big for my mac i had to cut some of it off. i will still recommend to others if they ask
3,Have you BEEN to Shakespeare & Co.?,"Surely many of the reviewers here have actually visited Shakespeare & Co. So I'm surprised that no reviews (that I've seen; perhaps I missed something) point out that the place is -- I hate to say it -- a tourist mecca. It's not the shop's fault, of course. It's reputation draws tourists into what would be a cozy space to browse, but the last time I was there, there were about 60 people in a space that would actually comfortably accommodate six. The idea that any one person could walk into what was a chaotic madhouse and be pulled out of the crowd to be taken upstairs for tea strains credulity. The idea of soft time in a bookish bookstore (most bookstores now are anything but bookish -- places like Strand Books and Three Lives in Manhattan stand out as exceptions) is lovely. It's just difficult for me to reconcile that notion with the frantic tourist scene the much-storied shop is today."
3,Just okay,"I was excited to get my teeth into this memoir but found it ultimately a little disappointing. There are some nice passages describing Whitman and his crazy personality, but I finished 'Time Was Soft There' with the feeling that Mercer had filled it out in order to have enough material for a book. Considering the literary culture of the shop, and the legacy of the authors that passed through it, there is something off-putting about this."
3,mixed,Great all around product. White light is great. But... the black light is dim in my opinion. The buttons are just a touch loose. I still have a great opinion of the brand and own several lights that I am very impressed with. Don't buy this model solely for it's ultra violet light.
3,Good for some tasks,"I ordered this flashlight because i work in a bar, and uv lights are a quick, easy way to detect fake id's. The white lights on this product are increadably bright for LED's, but the uv led is the wrong wavelength for reading ceartain types of ID's. It works great on those with white uv ink, such as RI, CT, and PA, but on ID's with colored uv ink (CA, MA, MI), it doesn't work at all."
5,Butterfly lover,"I love butterflies and this sign fit perfectly into my decor. I have it on the wall in my hallway, but it could easily survive outside as well."
4,Great Companion to Bloody Williamson,"If Paul Angle's BLOODY WILLIAMSON got your attention, you might consider DeNeal's portrait of Birger and his violent life as a natural companion piece. His exhaustive examination of the gangster's persona and the spectacle of his death is well-written and enjoyable. For those not so interested in the particulars of Birger's life, this study offers a solid snapshot of southern Illinois culture during the years just before the Depression. Ballowe's smart, albeit brief, introduction is also nicely done."
5,Excellent!,"This is an excellent book for the functional consultant, project manager or business professional seeking to implement SAP in their organization. I found the information invaluable and YES I GET it, use the STANDARD SAP software! It was not hard to read (even though the book could use some serious editing) and I simply could not put it down! I wished he would have given more direct information on how to break into SAP as career, for obvious and understandable reasons there's so much bias against junior consultants. In either case I got great information from it and I recommend it highly."
3,Good Content. Poor Grammar,"Overall, this book has a lot of good content regarding the author's experiences with implementing ERP systems, specifically SAP. However, numerous typos throughout the book take away from the credibility of the author. Not sure why there are so many grammatical errors, but all in all not a bad buy for the price."
3,"Advice is good, but confusing for non natives in English.","This book introduces the reader in the SAP basic concepts, from a light view. It is what a beginner needs, and it is just what the book promises in Amazon's page. The problem is for readers who learned English as a second language because it contains multiple type mistakes, such as missing letters or switched letters that often change the complete sense of the message.It can be better; the content is worth a reviewed edition. I would even say it's worth a Spanish version - editors: contact me ;)"
1,This book was a disappointment,"The title of the book ""A Map of the Minefield"" is misleading. The book is primarily a sales pitch for SAP and the author explains that all problems experienced are the fault of the SAP customer. Frank discussion of the challenges implementing SAP is minimal. Additionally the book contains many typos which is unprofessional and annoying to read around."
1,Preliminary comment,"I've just started reading the book, but the poor writing style is really a problem. I know a few folks have suggested that better editing would have made this a better book. After reading only 40 pages or so, I couldn't believe a reputable publisher would let this go out the door ""as is"". It turns out this is a self-published book.While I'm not challenging the author's credibility, I think he's done himself a disservice in releasing this book in its present form; publishing a poor quality book is rarely a career enhancement. I strongly suggest he invest in a professional editor and publish a second edition ASAP. While I'm in it for the $17.50 I've already spent, I can't see myself recommending this book to anyone I know simply because of the poor quality of the writing."
2,Dissapointing,"I expected more than the stereotypes and classic explanations.The writing style does not help on grabbing the attention, with so long explanations that easily lose the attention of the reader"
3,"Wonderful idea, average execution","Hey don't get me wrong, author had excellent idea in place to write on minefield of SAP. And its good reading mostly. I would like better feel on tech minefield though. I would like more real examples and less general ones. Average exection. Maybe becuase my IQ is less than the authors I don't understand everything :)I'm will keep looking for a tech minefield book on SAP. SAP doesn;t have anything on this that I can see, but they come out with many new titles each month. I will keep this one in the meantime."
4,Maybe the best title translation,"The title R.L. Wing has is far more representative of the content. It really is not all about ""The Art of War"", though it does address combat strategy. I find it is far more about success without ever having to come to blows. The commentary on the ""four conflicts"" is of interest as we appear to live in a society that only recognizes three of the four stated and denies the remaining one. From the other side of the world, a radically different time, a very different culture, and more than a thousand years ago he predicts the consequences. As he is dealing with human nature and behavior, the book is timeless in its commentary.A Chinese national who I once worked with told me after reading this edition he thought it the best translation visually and in content he had seen to date."
5,The Definitive Work.,"I've read 'em all. From Iacocca to Trump to Musashi to Machiavelli. Seems that they were all inspired to reinvent the wheel. Well, I got news baby, the wheel is here, and there's no better shape for rollin' than round! Be young, have fun, read Wing!"
2,a lot of mumbling,This would be a really great series if the narration weren't so soft as to challenge the listener to understand it. Quinn has a great voice but the director should be shot. I cannot imagine what the motivation was for having such an obvious shortcoming other than to say that it sounds really cool and artsy and...well...maybe that was the motivation. It is annoying as hell. And I am a 44 year old man with perfect hearing and I regularly watch documentaries of all types.The story is fascinating and the video is great but the narration kills it.
4,Charming art from the distant past,"As there are no reviews of this book, I will tell you a little about it. This is a very old scroll from a Buddhist temple, the images were painted in black ink by monk in the oldest style of brush painting. It is about twenty pages in length. There are cute foxes, frogs, monkeys, hares, and a pheasant behaving like nobility of that time on a picnic. They have archery contests, races, and mischief. The text which goes with the images was added by a contemporary western writer in the 1950's, but it is very modest, and does not interfere with the reader's imagination which is following the images. The monk did not write any text, and I assume he felt the images had no need of words to tell the story. It is the nature of brush painting; minimal, simple and sure. There is nothing profuse or elaborate about this art. This book is not for everyone, and it is brief, but I think it's fine and enjoy it."
5,IWonderful series!,"Honestly, I did not read it. I look forward to have it. I gave the book five star according my evaluation to the Volume 1 and my respect to David B. Fogel."
3,What Gives?,Can this be true? $75.00 ? For a movie? Are you people for real? ! I am a Sonny Landham FAN! But no movie is worth $75.00!!! I realy can't belive people have payed this high a price for a movie from the 70's! Get Real!!!
4,A Good Beginning,"This is a beautiful book! The illustrations (photographs of nature, representing yin and yang characteristics) give an added depth to the basic history and brief interpretations of the hexagrams that I found very enlightening and engaging. I was given the classic translation of the I Ching (the Princetion University edition of the Wilhelm/Baynes translation) but found that rather heavy going. My only caveat is that the simplification of the interpretations may be in conflict with the whole idea of the information to be gained from casting hexagrams.That said, I would recommend this as a first book to any one who, like me, is curious about this ancient system of divination. Then move on to the classics if it seems to speak to you."
2,Wrong version,Apparently there are different versions of this game and I received the British version. We had the game years ago and I would like to know if there is any way you could send me the American version...the cards are definitely different.
4,Half pleased,Game was fun but was very disappointed in the condition of the packaging.All pieces were there but the box was all beat up and the sides torn up.Everything inside box was scrambled and mixed up.Took me 20 minutes to separate into correct piles and tape box back together.Will not order box games again.
1,"Pure junk. Do not get this, you will be sorry...","I was looking for some ""best of"" New Wave downloads for my iPod and came across this. I read the review above this one and couldn't believe it got one star. I mean, NOTHING could be that bad, right? Wrong! This starts off with a couple of New Wave classics and then just veers off the map. The previous reviewer is right about the U2 song being mislabeled. In fact, That person is right about everything. This is crap. I'm glad I chose to sample this before downloading it, as this is PURE GARBAGE. There are a couple of legitimate New Wave ""best of"" compilations available. This is NOT one of them! Avoid, avoid, avoid."
4,This is Not a `New Wave' collection but it fills a few gaps,"This is 80's New Wave (2CD set): While this is a more general collection than the title would lead you to believe, the songs here are of good quality and has enough oddities (that the other 80's sets ignore) to make this an interesting collection. If you can forgive the misleading ""new wave"" title, this is an interesting and enjoyable collection. Four Stars."
2,Poorly written but a story that needs to be told.,"Peter Balkian had a story that needs documenting and telling for the exposure of the hidden genocide of the Armenian people. Unfortunately, in my opinion his descriptions are superficial and trite and lack the depth and texture that a good writer brings to any work. For instance, while describing the lighting in his kitchen he uses the word 'strange'. Give me a break. Then he describes the shapes of the Armenian pastry Lamka as that of something from outer space. One can barely wade through this type of prose to get to the true story here. One wishes that this author spent more time developing the texture of this prose. I hate the way it is written and anyone that can get through deserves a prize."
1,Let the Historians Decide,I condemn all the hatred against any nations including Turks. What a sad way to attack a nation and her people. It is a cheap way to sell books. Let today's Armenia and Turkey get along and prosper instead of bringing a subject that should be left to historians to be investigated.
5,A connection,"I felt so connected to Balakian, his family and their ordeal. My Armenian family has suffered similarly, yet I never knew the horrid details of their past. This book educated me and opened a door to Armenian history.After reading this book, I sat with my Dad and for the first time, we talked for hours about the history behind my Grandparent's saddness.Thank you Peter Balakian for opening that door."
5,Amazing depiction of Armenian families and the genocide's impact on them.,"This is an amazing and poignant depiction of a typical Armenian family. The family could belong to anyone--it certainly could be mine. Without giving away the entire story, it is about genocide survivors who protect their children from the events of the genocide. Eventually, the stories are told and the truth is known, thereby changing the lives of the children. It is an emotionally difficult book to read, but is well worth it."
4,Balakian's book compares to...,You will want to read this great book . You do not have to be Armenian to understand the atrocities of the Turks against the Armenian people. Keep the tissues handy.
5,"Armenians first, Jews yesterday, Kosovo today---tomorrow?",Please make a correction to my submitted review. Change the spelling of holocost to holocaust.Thank you.
4,"P.S. ""Political correctness"" is meant positively.","In my review of ""Black Dog of Fate,"" I used the term ""political correctness"" to express the views likely to be held by intelligent, well-educated Americans with liberal political views. I would want to make it very plain that exactly these people should read Peter Balakian's book and become aware of the Armenian Genocide. The fear expressed in the review is that it might also become too tempting to read the book as a piece of belles-lettres for this reason, which is also the source of the comment about its being well put together and packaged in that sense, not in the commercial. The book succeeds brilliantly at what it is meant to do. The thrust of the review is that it is best read as an introduction to the issue which is very competent but not exhaustive."
5,BEAUTIFULLY Done!,"Hannah Hinchman is a Great Artist! I have all of her books and this one is full of beautiful watercolors and designed pages. All that you treasured in her other books only more of it!I have been to Montana once when I was 17, she describes it all so prefectly. A true inspiration to any art journaler.THANK YOU HANNAH!"
3,From a,"I agree with the reviewer who stated that she would recommend this book for the artists illustrations but not her personal views. I found her attitudes towards the hunters and locals who had lived off that land for generations to be judgemental, arrogant and off putting."
2,ho hum,"This is not a wretched book; I just could not take to it because of its condescending nature. From the very foundation of this novel, Ramus dumbs down all of his characters. It sort of felt like I was reading a book on the level of Dukes of Hazard. Only the writing, detail, and characters were more adept than the silly plot. Which was kind of odd and sort of sad.First of all, it is almost inconceivable that the main character would have ended up in prison the way that he did. Secondly, all of the problems that he goes through while in prison were set up with a very insane chain of events. The implausibility of it all just gets you down and it's hard to over look as the book progresses.I have a soft spot in my heart for Ramus. I have read all three of his novels and will read the next one he puts out. I hope that he lives up to his potential and writes a real taught thriller aimed at the thinking adult rather than brain dead plebe next time."
3,"Some good thoughts, but left me wanting more","I got this book with the hopes that it would give me some good, concrete ideas to use with co-workers and supervisors to improve how we handled projects in the workplace. What I believe I got was chapter after chapter telling me how much productivity will change once people begin to truly collaborate with each other (rather than simply partitioning the work), and how some companies are creating tools to aid this. I felt like I had not been given muchin the way of new techniqiues that I had not already heard from the Total Quality Management movement. There are some nice ideas though. The chapter on language presented some good thoughts, and the description of the qualities of collaborative relationships is good. Overall, the book reminded me of some asian cuisine. It tasted all right, but I was hungry again after a few hours."
5,Touching,A very touching and poignant look at the life of a famous punk star. After watching this documentary I gained any respect life she lived in the way she died. Through touching interviews you could see that family and friends really loved her and she really loved them. If you like punk music or just want to hear a story of the trouble soul is a great documentary.
1,Just another example......,"Well, all I can say is Satan is at work here, through you, Mr. Doherty. He always loves to knock the truth down - and you're book is just another example of that. But, he always likes to do it in a way that is very ""convincing"" for those who are searching for truth. Do not read this book."
2,Clearly Earl missies the Mark.....,"The issue with opinion like his is that atheism is easy. IN complete arrogance any 8th grader can clearly refute the possibilites of the scriptures using 8th grade science!What Earl misses is the basis for all believers.""Faith""Scientists have no faith seeking earthy proof. The ultimate arrogance is the man who can refute the smallest evidance of something he does not understand. Something that requires ""faith"" above all.Without faith this book is just as moot as the book by Sobel. Without faith. Neither is relavant.Tom B"
1,Just Remember,"When you are arguing whether or not Christ really existed (In the words of Stuart Briscoe and possibly others): If a man believes in Christ and lives his life accordingly, and he is wrong, then he has lost nothing. If a man doesn't believe in Christ and lives his life accordingly, he has lost everything..."
1,Cross Examining Witnesses That Are Not Present,"One can't help wondering how Mr. Doherty would have performed in a courtroom where the witnesses could actually answer for themselves. As the author not only controls the questions, but also the answers, his predetermined verdict should come as no surprise to anyone."
4,Don't read Strobel without it!,"Books by apologists frustrate me because as I read, counter-arguments enter my head and the authors just ignore them! I could barely get through Lee Strobel's ""The Case for Christ"" because of his infuriating tendency to pretend he was getting at all the facts. He claimed he was being impartial but he never challenged the ""experts"" he questioned; he just accepted all they had to say.Anyone honestly interested in the truth won't read apologists' books without also searching for skeptical rebuttal. Lucky for us, Doherty has written a comprehensive rebuttal to Strobel's book highlighting all the arguments Strobel conveniently left out or glossed over.Don't buy one without the other!"
5,Questioning the Foundation Myth,"Earl Doherty continues the scholarly liberation of us from Western society's founding myth, an historical Jesus Christ. Doherty's jaw-dropping premise, that Jesus never existed, won't be accepted overnight. Most of Christian study begins within faith and can hardly be expected to maintain a cold, dispassionate view of an Earthly Christ. Doherty's counterpoint dissertation springs from passion-for truth. Long into the future, American presidential candidates will probably have to mouth fealty to the Christian mythological founder. But ""Challenging the Verdict"" helps form a nucleus of work with profound implications for Christianity."
1,Lacks credibility,"Earl Doherty's attempt to discredit ""A Case for Christ"" fails miserably. His attack on Strobel's sources is a cheap shot at best. These experts that Sctrobel interviewed for his book have the most impeccable credentials; something Doherty fails to include in his book.Doherty critizes Stobel's scholars without even interviewing anyone. He uses Stobel's book to write his own book. Talk about lazy and slipshod.By not giving Stroble's experts a chance to rebut Doherty's claims, Doherty gives up any semblance of credibility.Nice try Doherty, but no cigar."
2,Challenging the Verdict: Wholly Shortsighted!,"I am an Orthodox Christian, and I highly recommend reading this book.For all persons who have intensively studied the origin of Christianity, this book will merely confirm your views. Case in point, in my humble opinion, the entire book is weak -- shortsighted.The reader will quickly learn that Mr. Doherty's views are unfounded.I only purchased the book because I try to remain open-minded; but this book -- thinking that Mr. Doherty could provide substantial evidence disproving the origin of Christianity -- proved me wrong. And I took his book seriously!Mr. Doherty focused on the ""in-obvious,"" rather than the ""obvious."" Read with caution."
1,unconvincing,"this was a terrible book...boring, bitter, and very unconvincing. it's sad when someone has to fight another's beliefs but has no convincing beliefs of their own, or answers, or even good guesses."
1,Don't be surprised,"This book doesn't surprise me at all, never forget the devil masquerades as an angel of light!! If people want to jump on this bandwagon and disregard the ton of evidence that has been accumalated from many sources including archeologist and even scientist, then let them!!This is one reason why Jesus says he will come like a theif in the night, he will catch millions thinking, doing, and believing everything except the right thing!! This book is clear evidence of that!!"
1,Well...,"After reading the reviews of this book, I for one am just so relieved that all of these tortured tortured geniuses who loved the book finally have a voice. From what I can tell, most of them were ""forced"" to read this book by their crafty and maniacal friends and loved ones. It must be wonderful for them to finally have a champion that can refute all of this backward, nonsensical, mean spirited hokum that we call Christianity. Nevermind the fact that the only expert that Doherty brings to bare is himself. Nevermind the fact that Strobel had more than a dozen. Nevermind the fact that Christianity is the force that has been changing the world for the last 2000 years.Seriously though, what you should remember is that when Strobel gathered his evidence, he was seeking to disprove Christianity."
1,Methinks the rest doth gush too much,"...Provided you are armed with encyclopedias,scholarly theological treatises and access to historical documents, (and the time to go through them all) you'll be able to quickly identify DOherty's fatal mistakes.Many others have, and you can find the critiques elsewhere on the internet...Much of his case rests on the fact that Strobel's Case For Christ is written as a popular, rather than scholar's, book and is less technically precise making it an easier target for Doherty to twist out of context.As I said, though, start going back to the source material used by Strobel in his references, and the source material used by the scholars, and Doherty's argument turns to dust.Don't be fooled into purchasing this thinking that it really is the silver bullet to tackle Christianity with. It's not even close."
5,"A beauty, ahead of her time","I was in love with this album in the mid 60's, when I was Young & Impressionable. The LP disappeared during some move at some time in my life, and I was very excited to learn it had come out in CD recently. Judy Roderwick was a student at Colorado University when she recorded this album, along with a couple of brilliant side musicians. While, 30 years later, some of the songs seem politically incorrect -- she's a ""white girl"" singing ""Black & Blue"", for example, and those old blues tunes do tend to be somewhat misogynistic in nature -- the brilliance of the late Ms. Roderick's surprisingly mature voice, and the passion of her performance makes this more than simply a musical sample of 60's coffeehouse folk; it's a real treasure and she will never be duplicated. It's hard to believe that she was only 22 or so when it was recorded, it is so simply sophisticated and moving."
5,The Late Great Judy,"I saw her several times at the Second Fret in Philly and was awed by her. She leaves, I think, Raitt in the dust with her singing and the songs she recorded. She didn't, however, play slide guitar which is what made Raitt so big. And her recording legacy was, unfortunately, very brief. However, I did have her Columbia lp Nothing but the Blues which I lost and refound on eBay and recently had transferred to cd. It was produced and backed by Bobby Scott with backup by John Hammond and I love this recording also, although more jazzy with a big band feel. But her version of He Was a Friend of Mine is just beautiful. I was glad to hear Mollie O'Brien do one of her songs on the 40th anniversary of the Philly Folk Festival. Nice to know she's still remembered by the ""younger"" generation. All those who saw her live still remember her and the thrill she brought to us through her singing!"
3,socked in nothing else to watch.,"Not Bob's best. Elke Sommer was good, so was Bob, plot was very thin. If you have to watch something..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIES OF THE 60'S,I've always loved Elke Sommer. In my eyes she was the sexiest woman alive back in the 60's. I think this movie is hilarious as a slapstick type movie. This is my #1 Bob Hope Movie. Restoration of this film was fabulous. Glad it was done on full screen. I get to show movies for free to the elderly & the full screen movies come over really well for them to see.
1,FOX Again Screws Up with Non-Anamorphic Transfers,"I bought this set because a previous reviewer raved that all but 2 of the films were anamorphic widescreen. Baloney. Once again, FOX has taken old MGM transfers and repackaged them on ""I'll Take Sweden"" and ""The Road to Hong Kong"" both of which are NON amamorphic letterboxed. Worse, FOX is deceptive in simply stating ""widescreen"" on the box and disc cases whether the film is anamorphic or not. Adding to the annoyance is that the three anamorphic discs are flipper discs with full screen versions on the other side. Therefore, you really don't know what you are getting. They did the same thing with their recent 4 disc Elvis set with some anamorphic and some not but all saying simply ""widescreen"" with repackaged MGM transfers. BLECCH."
2,"Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number!","Grandma wanted it.I didn't.seems that she liked it.but wanted the whole set instead of just the one movie.so well there you go, a ticked of Grandma..............."
3,All this for one movie,"This package is a bunch of movies I never knew that Bob had a part in. But, I only wanted the movie ""Boy Did I Get the Wrong Number"". That movie is not released individually, so I had to buy the whole package and threw away the others."
4,If Only...,"I bought this collection to have a DVD copy of Princess and the Pirate. I am not going to suggest that you buy this collection just for that movie. It was dark, and had a blip of a minute or two where it was double exposed. I didn't notice any cuts, but I kinda stopped paying attention after awhile. Very SAD!We have also watched ""Boy, Did I get a Wrong Number"", ""The Facts of Life"" and ""They Got Me Covered"". All three were good viewing, no problems. As movies, they are what I remembered and enjoyable.Over all I would say this is a good collection. Just make sure you get it on sale. ;-)"
5,I'm glad it's still available,"I know that practically every item reviewed on Amazon has 4 or 5 stars, because people usually review things that they like, but this is really wonderful music. I remember particularly the guitar accompaniment to ""Love Will Endure,"" with its dissonant f-sharp in the bass against a C-major chord. This album is one of my all-time favorites."
1,The greatest invention,"A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M; asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times. One student said fire. Another said gunpowder. Another said the internal combustion engine. Then a Texas A&M; football player on the front row said, ""The thermos bottle.""When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, ""You put something hot in it and it stays hot. You put something cold in it and it stays cold.""The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, ""How do it know which to do?""That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere. I liked the first book, in spite of its ""magical"" science. This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle. Much ado about little."
4,Blue Thundar Sequel,It was not as good as the first novel Blue Thundar but on the whole it was a good sequel. It followed the same format from a one person view point this time through the eyes of Manuel's son. I have reread Blue Thundar several times for it was exciting and uplifting. Red Lightening had little more depressing outlook. I lived through Katrina so the subject could have jaundiced my view.
2,One of his worst,"Tied for first place with ""Mammoth"" as the worst John Varley book I've read.I usually love his stuff and have read Titan, Wizard, Demon each about five times and recommend them to everyone.This novel could have been a very, very short story. Way too much explanation on just about everything. How to move in low gee gravity, showering in low gee, the state of Florida and dead bodies, life on Mars, how ""earthies"" suck at moving on Mars. How to get from Mars to one of it's moons. Pretty much a lot of filler, very little plot, nothing extraordinary or unique or interesting about the book. One new, boring invention from Jubal, no new uses for the squeezer.Just not a lot of work went into this one.LOVED Red Thunder. Have read it twice. This was a very disappointing sequel."
3,An Average Space Opera,"This is my first book by John Varley and I was not impressed. In this book an unidentified object crashes into Earth causing a devastating tsunami. The main character is a seventeen-year-old Mars resident named Ray Garcia-Strickland surveys the damage, unaware the disaster may have been caused by his uncle's dangerous time-altering invention. A couple of things of note, this book is part of a sequel, it contains some descriptions of sex and has some strong language."
2,All over the place,"This here's one of those SciFi novels that's written about the ""future"" but it's really more about the author's view on current events. I like John Varley. I've enjoyed some of his books and enjoy reading his film reviews on his web site. But the meandering plot here looses focus to many times in dabbling in Katrina/tsunami horrors, populist anti-government rhetoric and a coming of age story. There's some nifty ideas, and swift turns of phrase hidden here and there, but the weaknesses outweighed the strengths for me."
2,Too much drag,"I don't have much to say about this novel, other than that (a) it dragged too much, with portions of it coming across as a travelogue; and (b) the Squeezer drive had next to no explanation. Better to just assume an unexplained form of faster-than-light drive (as many good SF novels have done) that is just part of the story's backdrop -- i.e., NOT a plot driver -- or else use/invent a drive concept for which you can give a believable explanation.As for the plot dragging its heels, too much time was spent with the main characters exploring a tsunami-devastated U.S. east coast, and far too little on corporate and political entities that attack Mars. As well, there wasn't much excitement or drama surrounding the Red Planet's rise to independence. For a much more intriguing, engaging Mars-gains-independence story, I highly recommend Greg Bear's MOVING MARS."
1,Toy? I thought this was a musical instrument!,I bought this to use in drum circles because I thought it would be easier to carry in my backpack than a drum. Well it is easier to carry but it turned out to be more of a toy than a musical instrument. It is so small that it can not be heard if there are more than a couple drums. I am disappointed that it does not fit my needs.
3,This book has a chic appearance but the text is too simple,"Chic Simple is a book of glossy pictures and bad text. The writing is poor in both substance and in its unreadable graphics. The text full of senselessly varying fonts and styles. There is good information squeezed in tiny print in the back of the book, but that is obtainable from any of the clothing books out there already. If you like gazing at men's clothing, though, it's a nice book to thumb through for a few minutes. It will provide you with some nice visual examples of how to put together outfits. However, a good salesman could do the same. I don't understand the rave reviews given to this book. It's not bad but it's not great either. If you're looking for real understanding of clothing beyond pictures, go elsewhere."
2,almost NO HELP AT ALL,"I was hoping for a book that would provide specific advice on how to pick quality clothes that work for my body type (tall & thin). This book wasn't very helpful. It was full of fluff that got in the way of reading the parts of the book that were somewhat helpful. For example, much of the book is filled with trivia and history of different types of clothes. Another example of fluff was the tips on what types of music to listen to while wearing the clothes (no I'm not kidding). I don't give a damn about the history of Chinos and I don't think other men care either. The helpful information in this book could have filled a book one quarter of the books size. And in all honesty, even the helpful stuff wasn't that helpful."
2,well...,"If you are young and gay or just young then this book may be of some use as you cruise the shopping malls. If on the other hand you are a little older, gay or straight, shy away from J Crew and Abercrombie, cringe at khakis, wonder at those who show their t-shirt peeking up from under their polo shirt and have given up wearing ball caps in public and are ready to upgrade your image then Alan Flusser's THE ART OF PERMANENT FASHION would be a better buy."
3,ONLY A STARTING POINT....,"This book is a good start, so you won't be at a complete loss in a men's clothing store. But no book can be definitive as a guide to something so complex. Buy a jacket off the rack that fits comfortably in the shoulders, take it to a good tailor for alterations, and ask for advice on your wardrobe. Ask about your shape, about the appearance you want to project, about where to shop for good stuff. Listen to what he says. You'll save a lot of time, you'll save a lot of money, and you'll get personal guidance from someone who already knows what's in the book."
2,Not overly informatitve or useful,"The book has great pictures and gives a good basic description of clothing. Granted there are some ""classic"" pieces in there, you're probably better off walking around a department store to see what is fashionable at the time. In addition to department stores, a subscription to GQ or any men's magazine would probably work also."
2,Better books elsewhere!,"This book is ok, but the real nuggets worth reading the book are given short shrift and scattered throughout the book. The majority of the book is formatted like a coffee table book, filled with big pictures, meaningless platitudes, and outfits only runway models could like.A MUCH more useful book to learn about men's fashion in the professional world is ""The Indispensable Guide to Classic Men's Clothing,"" which is also availabe from Amazon. That book has the basics from diagrams on how to tie a tie to comparing the qualities of fabric to tips on proper care for clothing."
3,"Handy book, but not all encompassing","This is a handy book. However, it didn't go into much detail. You saw a couple of good outfits, but that's it. I found it useful, though."
1,one star is not low enough,"I returned this book. It was pretty insulting. Thought the appendices were pretty informative. But on the whole, not enough information about quality and the basics of good style. Hochswender is a great writer but this book has no substance."
2,Book of definition to men's wear.,"This book is a fun dictionary to men's clothing. History of style is fun to read but does nothing for the closet. If anything, this book suggests too much new purchases of numerous ""classic"" items. I don't how how classic a pair of shoes that resemble women's flats... complete with black bows on top... is to the modern man. It certainly isn't to me... If it is for you, then by all means, you might like this book."
3,"Ok, but not the right product for my problem","This product did remove some of the tear stains, but since they are so bad, I'm using the same companies ""i-Stain"" product to help cure the tear stain. I'm sure this product would be ok for a dog that doesn't have severe staining. I will use if I can get the problem under control first."
5,A most important message to every world citizen !,"Get this book and read it , but read it with the eyes of your heart ! Your heart will understand this message easely - and then go and walk your talk in balace and beauty , and live it everyday , for the benefit of all what lives ! Give your children and the no-eyes , the unborn , a future which is worth to be lived !We suggest to Amazon.com : sponsor a free copy to every US-citizen - this would be the most important action done so far , and Amazon would become famous for ever , Yeah !"
5,The Red Thread,"Original choreography from the Isabella Duncan Dance Co in New York. Dance set to the Chopin's ""24 Preludes"". Music performed live by the John Link Project; arrangements for 5 voices, guitar, bass, drums and violin performed. ""The Red Thread"" is an emotionally charged suite of dances, a dynamic fusion of Duncan dance with other traditional and contemporary forms."
2,Disappointed with Amazon,"Product itself is good, excelent reference for those who care about organizations. Delivery was very poor, the book got to me damaged and in some pages the writings are not lined up. I claimed that to amazon and got no answer, very disappointed indeed."
4,Great peice of software,"This software wasn't all that good when it was 6 but on 7 it was more stable and more easier to use. There's certain things that I wish Logic could do like change the sound of the metronome to like a cowbell or something like that or record for than 1 hour. Its not good for recording a live performance that could last several hours. Those are the only 2 downsides to it. Other than that its a great peice of software. It gives you powerful and quality tools to edit, mix, record, and export to any type of audio type."
3,Oh the memories,"I remember playing this game back in the day. It was really fun-until I started playing starcraft and warcraft 2, etc. But occasionally I still play it on XP. It works fine if you run it in compatibility mode (Mine is set to 98)."
5,The work continues to astound!!!,This books takes right up where the first one left off and doesn't miss a single beat. The characters seem so real that you'll refer to them by name to people you meet. I do!!!I'm glad to know that there will be more in this series. L.A. is doing a great job of making vampires as real as the rest of us.
2,So-So,"I could not get into the book. I'm sure she appeals to some readers, but I couldn't get into it."
4,"""Sista is doin her thang!""","I loved the second installment of this book. It picks up where the first book left off. You'll enjoy reading about how Damali is coming into her own.This story could well be the Romeo & Juliet of the vampire novels. Two people who were destined to be together, but can't because of who they are {Carlos-Mater Vampire & Damali-Neteru (vampire slayer)}, but they still love each other. They're love is so strong that it transcends boundaries. However, the love has to be put on the back burner, so that they can help their respective families take care of business.Also, Carlos is the man! The way he stands up for his woman in the end is unforgetable.I can't wait for the next book ""The Hunted"". I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good series to sink their teeth into."
4,It just keeps getting better,"The Vampire Huntress series gets better! Ms. Banks' take on the levels of Hell and vampiric politics is quiet refreshing while still keeping to the overall ""traditional"" feel of vampire fiction. The undercurrent of ""Romeo meets Juliet"" as seen in the characters of Carlos Rivera and Damali Richards adds to the appeal of this great series.My only complaint still lies in the overly used ""hip hop""-style street slang that is constantly used in place of ""normal"" dialogue. While I understand the author's wish to convey the background of the characters through their speech, it's hard to think of Biblical and other supernatural references as being legitimate when the characters sound like they should be on MTV's ""The Real World"". Granted, the Buffy series wasn't much better with the use of California-Valley Girl slang, but at least the conversations were only peppered with ""Buffyisms"" and did not take over the entire dialogue."
4,Good entertainment value...,"I read this book directly after reading the previous book, Minion, as the last book left off halfway during the story & this book finishes the storyline.The night of Damali's awakening is swiftly approaching, yet she's still relatively unaware of everything that's going on. Carlos has been making several deals in an attempt to not only save Damali's virtue, but also his own life (such as it is). Meanwhile, her team is still shaken by the idea of a new race of vamps unlike any they've ever met.The story is still improving & despite a few flaws (and they are small ones), the book flows nicely & is easy to read. Some may argue that the books aren't very deep, & they would be right for the most part. Still, the books were never written to be the next Wuthering Heights, they were written to be entertaining, and they succeed."
4,still going!,so far i'm half way through the series and i'm still hooked on Damali and her crew. The missions are getting more and more complicated. Rivera and Damali's love story is another thing that keeps me hooked. i love nothing more than a good romance to cushion this book of damnation.
5,Whatever! Fallon,"This series is one of the best I've ever read, makes you think of dates and numbers and your behavior in a whole other way"
1,I tried to like this series,I really tried. I'm a paranormal fanatic and loved that Banks brought a new twist. I just couldn't get into the first book. Still I bought book 2 thinking maybe it'll get better. It didn't. I couldn't even finish this one.
2,Someone please find an editor,"Overall, this book lacked plot depth. It relied too heavily on the tried and true vampire cliches without developing the real character tension I'd like to have seen.What destroyed all enjoyment of this book for me was the constant stream of typos, grammatical errors, and shifts in Point of View. If it weren't for the generally above average character development, I would have given this book a single star and thrown it at the wall.As it was, Carlos thoroughly intrigued me throughout the book. His internal conflicts kept me reading to the end. Damali is at least somewhat different than the usual vampire novel heroine and I appreciated that. It was the overall lack of development of tension between them and the bad guys and the lack of development of a coherent trilogy length story arc that never really turned me on."
4,A good continuation,"There was more romance than action in this book, but it did a good job at moving the story along. The characters are well developed, interesting and engaging."
1,Word. to the wise. It doesn't get any better:(,"Just a quick review. Save your money for something better. Bad characters, bad action sequences, no excitement, no drama. I swear all the reviews for this book have been deleted so I thought this needed to be said. I really don't understand how anyone could rave about this book."
1,Hip Hop Dracula,"I've got to be honest, this book reads like someone from RAP City on BET wrote a vampire novel. I like the fact that it takes a look at horror fantasy from a african american point of view. However, this particular point of view is from a bad rap music video. It like it is trying to hard to be hard. I was hoping for a smarter book, with more plot and character development. I am a fan of the modern vampire genre, but this is one series I will skip completely in the future. I had high hopes for this book, but I was really disappointed. Maybe I am too old for a Hip Hop vampire story. Nah.. I just need a good hip hop vampire story."
3,"Shot in HD, not formatted in HD...?","Was pretty disappointed at finding this DVD not in true HD format. Most stations I receive now in 720p look better as far as detail expected in HD. The music is very good with this DVD and the colors are all quite fine, but don't buy this thinking your going to get a true high def 1080 DVD because it's not.When buying DVDs ""supposedly"" in HD, how the heck are you gonna be assured your getting true HD and not some upscaled program. After all, The Andy Griffith Show is on some HD channels, but will never be true HD... copy?If you don't expect any more than standard def from this, you'll be happy. I just expected more when it claimed, ""Shot in HD."""
1,Junk,"I don't know what everyone is so excited about. I wasn't expecting HD but I was expecting top quality standard def. as it was supposedly shot with an HD camera, but this is terrible. I have a brand new Samsung top of the line 40"" 1080P lcd display which puts out an amazing picture. My aquarium screensaver from Windows XP is far better than this and they aren't even real fish. If I were to see this not knowing it was a dvd, I would guess it was someone filming their fish tank with their home video camera. Very disappointed . . . played it for ten minutes . . . it's going out with the trash tomorrow morning."
1,Disappointed,"Don't let the ""recorded in high definition"" fool you. Picture quality is poor, even when compaired with the average standard definition DVD. Colors are exaggerated. If your display has been properly calibrated the results are artificial. Plasma owners should avoid as three of four available tank images have lightly colored fixed components that over an extended period of time could result in burn-in. Good concept, poor execution."
2,"Pleasant, but color temperature too high","Pass on this one. Not that the image quality is bad, or the arrangements are unpleasant. The color temperature is just set too high. That means the reds are too red. The blues are too blue. Not that bad that I'd return it, but not good enough that I'd recommend it to others."
2,Could be better...,"Has only one sound option (high-pitched, fast gurgling bubbles, like a mini fish tank) that gets annoying very fast. Its a pity because the footage is decent."
3,"Doesn't look real, as pictured on it's cover.","It's pretty, but doesn't look like an actual aquarium, which is what I expected. Now I need to buy a different one."
3,Aquarium DVD,"My boyfriend seemed to like it. Not quite a real aquarium, but at least you don't have to clean it."
5,Lives up to it's hype.,I am very satisfied with this DVD....It is great on my new 50 inch plasma tv. The music is very nice and the picture extemely clear and impressive.
3,Not Bad But Not Great,The DVD Aquarium is fun and when I played it for a party there was many positive reviews from friends. The DVD was shot in HD but I think the picture is really not that great. I have a HD television and I have other DVD's that have a sharper more detailed picture. In all I think the DVD was good not great and I recommend it if you want to simulate an aquarium on your television.
2,Something Fishy going on...................,The fish are either not real or it is a copy of a copy of a bad copy. I could not play it on my corporate lobby plasma with out people making comments about how cheap it make the expensive plasma look. They look like the fish on my laptop screen saver.I would only play this for a child that dosent know any better.
3,A useful intro to Statistics,"This is a good introduction to basic statistics. The skits are a little goofy, and after the first viewing I fast-forwarded through them, but the info is presented in a memorable way. I found it helpful to watch things like the normal distribution curve being created on screen, rather than just looking at a picture in a textbook.Statistics Vol I doesn't cover much material. If you're taking a college course in statistics you really need volumes I, II, and III. Together they cover roughly a college Stat I course."
3,Super Cheesy and Missing Parts,"The video is pretty cheesy. It was made in 1998 and didn't age well. However, the terribleness of it is actually amusing. One annoying thing about the DVD is it mentions an included insert card that you are to use while watching the movie. It is not included. It's pretty easy to find online, though.The pace of the video is a little weird. It goes through easy concepts really slowly and more difficult concepts quickly while throwing a lot of information at you. I think if I were a student trying to learn from it, I would likely not absorb a lot of it."
2,Anime Movie,"This review is just to let Curious lookers know that this product is the Japanese Animated Film, designed to play on your PC. It should not be mistaken for anything else. Frankly you're better off buying the VHS or DVD."
4,Great points and gets to the point!,"Some parenting books spout tons of theories...this book has doable ideas for getting teens to talk, guiding them through difficult days, etc. Challenging, but not at all overwhelming. I've read - and learned from - about 10 different ""teen parenting books"" during the last year, but this one might be the best and is, by far, the easiest and most enjoyable to read. Thank you, Karen Dockery!!!"
3,Insight and Repetition,"I paid the airport bookshop price for this book in desperation for something to do with 12 hours of flying. Guess what? With the induced sleep it took longer to read! I felt the information in this book was useful and insightful but was long and drawn out. I think that most people who buy this book will be looking for validation for their investment in or positive experiences with Cisco and, if they can make it through the middle of the book, will feel positively reinforced. There are detailed explanations for the author's viewpoints that are repeated over and over. I like the author's analysis of Cisco and the networking industry but this book could have been distilled down to a 40 page expanded outline form dissertation with 5 or 6 major points and 4 or 5 good stories and been easier to get through. Buy the book, the information is good, expect some sleep..."
5,Best Buy for Excellent Information.,"This book, along with Smither's CHRONICLES OF THE BIG BEND, are MUST READS for the serious Chisos Mountains area hiker. Along with the historical/geological/botanical/zoological everything elseical information, Maxwell includes a packet of foldout maps. The maps alone are worth the price of the book. Don't worry about the publication dates of the above books, nature works on a time-scale that makes these books timeless to the human reader. Most of the more recent publications can't come close to adding anything new to this information."
2,Fun for a minute,"Its great the first time through, but after you're done... you don't feel like playing it anymore. Wait for Forza Motorsport to come out."
4,"Mundane, pedestrian birdbath.....but well worth acquiring!","OK! So it doesn't have angels, birds, or seraphim welded to the edges! But where we live, the large birds feel comfy in it. We have ravens, robins, and the odd turkey.......yes turkeys visit our bath! And I find this bath to be very stable if the base is filled with sand. Another great, well-priced product from you folks!"
5,Great Value - Backyard Critters Delighted,"This birdbath is great! The sandstone appearance is appealing. It is stable and sturdy without any sand, etc. in the base, even when raccoons pull themselves up to drink! The bowl is easy to clean and is just the right depth for birds and squirrels. The bowl rim has a good-sized grip for bird feet of all sizes. My backyard critters took adantage of this bath within minutes after I filled it. This is a great value!"
1,"Ordinary, does not look like sand stone",Arrived in beat-up box with NO packing material. Came in damaged. Very dissappointed in it's look. Sent back due to damage but would have returned anyway as it is not the value it appears to be.
2,Amatuerish,"From the professional reviews, I had expected a well-written, scholarly book. This is neither. The writing is sometimes poor, and never eloquent or outstanding.The real problem, however, is the material. The portraits of Eugenie & Napoleon III are favorably one-sided. I don't feel as thought I could tell you the character of either after reading this book. Eugenie is impetuous is stated again & again but very few examples are given. Napoloen III is ""pathologically secreative"" but again no examples are given to support this statement. A very light-weight book."
5,Poetry - excellent!,"The reader can feel poet, Marlon William, pouring his love for written words into each poetic entry! His poems are ""crisp and clean"". Some favorites of this reader: ""To Love A Stranger"", ""You Saved Me"", ""No man Is A Man, Until..."" and ""TRUST"".Do NOT miss the short story entry, either. You will like Dillon.Marlon Williams is definitely a writer with staying power! -LC"
5,"Sensitive, yet powerfully moving","This book has the incredible ability to awaken your emotional senses. Marlon's sentiments are written with such clarity and sensitivity that it can easily take you to another place. I have enjoyed reading a couple of poems for myself during a quiet evening and have also shared it with friends. Our group discussions of poems like ""Thank You"" and ""Our Time"" have led to stimulating conversations and many late nights.I have given this book away as both a wedding and anniversary gift and received the most gracious thank you notes. People have said that it was such a unique gift and one they thoroughly enjoyed with each other.Butterfly Kisses comes from the spirit of an old soul who is living in our time. To think that someone so young has such passion in his writing is simply amazing. His work has a real perspective on the most powerful thing which none of us are exempt.....L O V E."
5,Howlingly Funny,"If you aren't familiar with Florence King, The Reader is a great place to start. Be warned, though: Ms. King is so conservative that she thinks the government's only purpose is to print the money, deliver the mail and declare war. Even so, as a moderate liberal with a sense of humor I found myself laughing out loud all by myself as I read. The exerpt from When Sisterhood Was in Flower made me laugh so hard that tears ran down my cheeks. It's too bad that novel is now out of print."
3,Aviator Glasses,Not the real thing. Just ordered them until I could find real Aviator Glasses. Not the greatest.
4,a notable book,"As somebody who has also had depression for most of my life, Smith's book struck a chord with me on almost every page. I didn't even know there were kinds of depression that were resistant to medication before, but Smith's chronicle of learning to live with the condition is helpful for those who *can* be helped by medications, too. A great read for people with depression and those who love them."
2,Deception,"The title says 16 inch....it IS square, even if hung as a diamond. What would YOU think each edge would measure? So, when it comes and it is only about 12 inches on the side and you realize that they 'meant' diagonal. Maybe they should have mentioned that in the ad? It IS metal, seems to be decently painted, But if you are expecting a nice-sized sign... nothing in the description says 'measured diagonally'... don't be deceived."
1,Complete Crap,"The thing looks nothing like Cosmos (kinda scary, really) and the sound is NOT Cosmo...it's some random guy...sounds nothing like he cartoon character! It says 3 phrases, but only a set of two as a fish and a set of two as Cosmo. One phrase is repeated between them both. The phrases are nothing what Cosmo would say:""Quick, make a wish!""""I have the attention span of a rodent!""[...]"
3,Okay... Could be better.....,"I got this for my birthday. I didn't think it worked. So I pressed the crown and heard the voice. It was so-so. Could be better. Again. It was just a random guy. Reminded me of Cosmo a little bit though, so okay in that prespective. If you are a person that does not care about quality, and are a fan of Cosmo, you should get this. It also changes into a fish."
3,Misleading,"They work well, but the picture shows two. You only get one and it comes in a ziplock bag with a post it note on it telling you what it is.I'd probably order it again, but from a different seller"
1,One of the worst of his movies,"I am a major Elvis fan. There were aome strong Elvis movies like King Creole, Jailhouse Rock, Wild in the Country, Flaming Star, That's the Way It is, and Elvis on Tour. But Paradise Hawaiian Style was among the worst. Elvis was notably overweight and the plot was awful. This movie can't hold a candle to many other Elvis 60s musicals like Blue Hawaii, Viva Las Vegas, Girl Happy, Roustabout, etc. Other good Elvis movies to check out are Loving You, Change of Habit, Kid Galahad, GI Blues, plus others. The King was the best, but Paradise Hawaiian Style was very weak and from a low point in his career."
3,a nice overview guide for hiking in washington,"this is a great last minute what do you want to do this weekend guide if you live in seattle. covering diverse options from the north cascades to the olympic coast to mt adams, the choices are many. trail descriptions are good, a small maps give a quick idea of where the trail goes. references at the beginning of each entry to corresponding USGS topos are very handy. many pictures of vistas offer enticements to visit the areas described"
5,My favorite author; my favorite book . . .,"Isaac Singer is a genius. You wonder what does a Yiddish collection of short stories lose in the translation? These are wonderful stories with vivid characterizations, lush imagery, and plots rich with emotion and imagination. My favorite is Passions: a meditation on how man becomes obsessed with something--to the extent of transforming one's life--anything can become a passion. I've read this collection probably four times over the years, and the mark of a great story is how rich and complex it remains upon a second or third reading."
1,bad,"Not what I expected, it burned out the day I got it. It may be good for low power items, but anything with a motor."
5,Our Dogs Love Them!,"We purchased these small Denta-Delicious bones for our 2 ""little girls"" - both of whom are in their chewing stage - and the large ones for our ""big boy"" (a 1 1/2 year Shepherd Mix). All of them love these bones, and they keep our little ones occupied for quite some time. Another plus is that they're good for their teeth & breath (a BIG plus for us - smile)!Overall, I would highly recommend denta-delicious to other pet owners. Our 3 give them ""2 paws up""!"
4,good cover,Cover worked but had to modify it to work for my application. I thought it would seal everything but it only covers the front and sides.
1,Shoddy quality,"Product is not as pictured. Looks like a dimestore fake. I had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids, and now have to spend more money to buy her something else. I would not give this to a 4 year old-- let alone a 34 year old. I am very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not quite as represented.,"The packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale, nice black leather case, MUCH nicer than the bracelet deserved, however.The bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap. It is not rounded as pictured, but flat like a dog tag (only much smaller). I'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but I would never wear it by itself. I understand though that it is NOT an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for .925 silver at that price."
1,Not worth the shipping costs much less $60 for NOTHING...,This was the most pitiful thing I had ever seen. I had been so excited that I had found a bracelet that was nearly identical to one that had recently gotten stolen. My previous bracelet was purchased at a mall kiosk and for almost the same price so I was in heaven. I couldnt wait to receive my new bracelet. !!! What a true disappointment...I would not have bought this item for $10 had I seen it. I have bought many many things from Amazon and will continue but this was an eye-opener.
5,great,"it came quickly and was just exactly, precisely, what i really really really really expected . brand new and great"
5,Beautifully Created Documentary,"This is an excellent, engaging documentary. I saw it at a screening in Chicago and was so impressed with these young adults. I have to believe that the trajectory of many of their lives was changed by their involvement in slam poetry."
4,"Works great, but included BT stack doesn't support iTunes","This product works great. I previously had a class 2 adapter, and whenever anyone used the microwave oven at work, I'd lose audio. Since switching to this device, I haven't had any problems with the microwave even when standing next to it.One thing to note, however, is that this adapter comes with the Toshiba Bluetooth stack. It (the Toshiba stack) supports avrcp, but apparently it doesn't work with iTunes. (i.e. You can't play/pause or control tracks.)I switched to the BlueSoleil stack, and everything works as expected now. If you use iTunes, I suggest you buy a different adapter that has the BlueSoleil stack included. But the adapter itself does its job, and does it well."
4,first use,I found this product to be quite handy..I sync my computer and phone at times and this works wellThanks
1,It don't work,"I bought this USB adapter to interface with my Motorola V3x cell phone and HT820 Motorola headsets. It did pair with the phone but was not fully functional. It would not pair with the headset. I have since bought the Motorola PC850 USB adapter, It only took 15 minutes to get it working perfectly with both the phone and headset.I consider this Zoom adaptor a piece of junk."
2,Cute to look at but runs small.,"This is a very cute shoe as far as appearance, but has absolutely no foot support in the very very least. The elastic in the back rubs on the heel and creates blisters. While I do think that after a break in period this would probably go away and even without any foot support they would be a cute shoe to wear for short periods of time...I will also say they run about a 1/2 size small so I never really got the chance to break them in. I ended up passing them along to someone else when after trying to wear them my feet hurt from my toes pushing against the seams in the toe box and I also had blisters on my heels."
2,Began reading Rainbows End ready to be amazed,"I began reading Rainbows End ready to be amazed.The story is set in 2025 San Diego. We followthe famous poet Robert Gu.Now cured of Alzheimers, but missing allrecent changes in technology.Which we are now introduced tothrough Robert's experience.So far so good.We learn that everyone is plugged into the net on a constant basisvia wearable computers with contact lenses for output display.Through your contact lenses you can ""google"" in midair.There is a complete visual overlay on the ""real"" world,allowing everyone to effectively ""live"" in whatever fantasy world they desire.And the DHS - departmentment of Homeland Security - logicis deeply embedded in all hardware.Athletes are on drugs ...etc.Its all very neat and all very likely,but not very exciting, and not very amazing,actually. This is morelike today than 17 years out in the future ....I wanted to be excited about this book -but in the end I was not. I am afraid.-Simon"
1,Not Like His Other Work,"Well, I have to agree with a lot of the other Vinge fans who have posted here.Having been a long-time Vinge fan myself (I've read everything he's ever written -- and loved it all, even the earliest stuff), I have to say that I am sorely disappointed by this title.Like so many of the others who have reviewed this book, I'm having to force myself to even finish it. It's just one of the most bland, uninteresting books I've read in a long time. The future world state is mildly interesting, but it's nothing compared to the future worlds that Vinge has created in his other novels. And the character development and storyline is just atrociously uninteresting.To be honest, I'm flabergasted at how bad this novel is. It is a total snooze. And it's hard to believe it came from the same author of some of my favorite Sci-Fi books of all time."
2,I really hate to give up on books...,"... but this one just kept putting me to sleep [literally]. I have devoured Vinge's books since I stumbled upon a copy of A Fire Upon the Deep. What makes Vinge interesting goes much deeper than simple futurizing and whiz-bang techno-jiggery. His characters are so memorable, especially the treacherous ones [who can match the Tines of AFUtD, or the Emergents of A Deepness in the Sky?].This book, sadly, relies on a spooky premise of a not-so-distant future to win through, and features characters that are, well, down right boring. I just don't really care how this book ends, and that's never a good sign, especially after force feeding myself on it for two hundred pages.Vernor, please give us fascinating characters! You're among the best at that."
4,I'm surprised by the somewhat negative reviews,"Even though I have been reading science fiction for a long time, I had never read anything by Vernor Vinge. However, Amazon repeatedly suggested him to me, and I had purchased, but not yet read, The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge for my Kindle. However, I came upon Rainbows End at a hardbound clearance counter, bought it, and read it immediately. I really loved it. My only real criticism is that Vinge throws out many interesting ideas and fails to follow up on them. To my mind, the book begs for a sequel. I think five stars should be reserved for classics, so I gave Rainbows End four stars- but I think it is great, great science fiction. If Vinge's other novels are really better, as the hard-core fans seem to think, I am very excited about reading them.The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge"
5,Vision for the future is inspiring,"Some people criticize this story because of the technical explanations, but that is what I love about Vinge's stories, the technology. I also like his characters and scenes, and this one has some great characters."
2,Not one of Vinge's better works,"I am a long time fan of Vernor Vinge. I have read _A Fire upon the Deep_ three times and _A Deepness in the Sky_ twice, and probably will read them again. However, Rainbows End didn't grab me as strongly. While the basic plot is quite good, the pacing seemed off and the characters just didn't seem realistic. Also, the ending was unsatisfactory. So, my final judgment is: OK story, but not up to the standard of his other books."
2,Some good speculation about the future in a not-so-good story,"I loved most of the other books by Mr. Vinge. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Rainbows End. The author clearly invested a lot of time in trying to figure out how the world may look like in a few tenths of years. In this, I believe he did well. The problem is, that all this insight and description (e.g., what is going to be taught in schools, the interconnectedness of the world, the superimposition of virtual to real views, etc) does not combine with a good and catching story.The first 4 pages of the book do primise something great - what unfortunately is not delivered in the rest of the book."
2,"Couldn't finish it, unfortunately...","I love sci fi, and I love Vernor Vinge, but man, I just could not finish this book. It has some interesting details about future tech and society, but Vinge spends waay too much time on diddly details and the story never. gets. going. I made it to the last several chapters and could not care less what happened to the characters. Maybe one day I'll dot the ""i"" and finish it. Such a shame, because ""A Deepness in the Sky"" is just brilliant. Oh well... if I could write half as well, I'd be happy!"
4,Rainbow's End by Vernor Vinge,"Not as inventive as his earlier novels, but still a complex story of a world in which people are adapting to rapidly expanding technology."
2,"Not up to his usual standards, or at least my expectations.","I'm a big Vernor Vinge fan with Fire and Deepness being two of my favorites. The Peace War series is well done also.This has left me cold though. It just isn't moving fast enough, and has me just disassociated enough, that I'm having a hard time caring what is next.The characters aren't that likable and the storyline is moving so slowly, that I just can't bring myself to pick the book back up. Combine that with a storyline that is somewhat hard to follow with libraries being destructively digitized and people not being able to keep up with the current technology and I ended up not finishing this one.Which is really surprising considering HOW MUCH I like the novels mentioned at the beginning of this review."
3,An interesting view of the not-too-distant future,"Historically, I've been quite the fan of Vernor Vinge, especially his earlier works, so when I heard that Rainbow's End was released, it immediately made it to the front of my to-read list. The book is set in the near future, in a world where augmented reality and ubiquitous connectivity is as much a part of day-to-day life as the telephone is today. The plot is a complex, perhaps convoluted story that's described well enough in other reviews that I won't bother going into it here.Vinge does a great job of putting us in this world, and exploring the effect it has on the people in it - its nuances, that 'haves' and 'have nots', risks, and so forth. But I think the book was mostly about the world it was set in, with the plot line being almost an afterthought.Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the book, and recommend it. But don't worry too much if you think you're having a hard time tracking all the details of the story - that's not what its really about."
2,Booooooring,"If you have enjoyed Vinge's previous books A Deepness in the Sky and A Fire Upon the Deep, do not expect to find a similar book here. This book has a meager conflict, strange and flat characters, hard-to-follow developments, in short, nothing to recommend it. It felt like a begginer's attempt. Not even the technology upon which the entire atmosphere of the book was based was of any interest at all - it felt childish sometimes, and Vinge dedicated pages upon pages to describing it in detail. Several times I found myself lost - who wanted what, who was following who and so on. I had to struggle through it."
2,"Good tech ideas, plot lacking","Rainbows End has some clever tech/AI ideas like the internet/computing access via clothes/contact lenses. The plot and the characters, however, are lacking consistency and depth. The threads may have been chosen too distant: a poet trying to recover his abilities, a magic rabbit as computing superpower, a conspiracy against destroying books and a project for mass mental manipulation. The latter never gets explained, nor does it get the attention one would expect from the first few pages. The end left too many questions unanswered. The fates of several key characters are not even alluded to."
2,Couldn't Finish,"I loved A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky, so I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, Vinge bobbles the ball with flat, uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. The world envisioned isn't all that strange from a technical perspective (which is fine), but it is also characterized by a nearly unrelenting nastiness. I don't have a big problem with that, as it isn't too far off from the way reality is headed, but without anyone I care about to make the journey with, it simply isn't worth the time."
1,Terrible,"I was hoping a Hugo award would mean a good book. I was wrong.I won't get into all the detail--the reviews above do a good job of pointing out the obsessiveness of the book with 'new' technologies which are not new and not interesting, but they didn't point out the biggest flaw: the writing is terrible. The characters are shallow and uninteresting. The story goes nowhere. There are one or two mildly interesting concepts but presented, again, in a shallow manner. And just the writing--the 'slang' is stupid and sensless (as well as inconsistent), it doesn't flow, I could go on and on, but enough. Don't bother."
4,I want more,Vinge has always captured my attention and this book is does it again. The near future is believeable and I particularly found his thoughts on how things will be built spot on. The reeducation of the old is already in progress and actually quite scary to this 50 year old geek. I would recommend that you read this book with an eye to either the beginning of a series or at least one more book. My belief is that this series is going to get alot more interesting.
2,"Interesting Concepts, but....","A 4 rating for the ideas behind the novel, especially how our networked society will continue to (d)evolve ... unfortunately it is written like a teen novel and I gave up on it half way through ..."
2,I wish it would end.,"I told myslef I wouldn't finish bad books, but somehow I've put in enough time that I can't forice myself to stop. Not that it's good! It's not. the chracters are not interesting, the situations are sometimes unintelligible, and the descriptions are drawn out way too much. I keep hoping that it will redeem itself, but that outcome seems unlikely. Skip it."
4,Somewhat disappointing,"I have been looking forward to another Vinge novel for years now, but this was a bit of a letdown. It's good, but not stunning like ""A Fire Upon The Deep"". Set 20 or 30 years from now, his political and tech extrapolations are reasonable and interesting, but not enough in themselves to sustain the interest of most people. It doesn't have the grand sweep of his best work.Not a bad story at all, just not great. It feels like ""True Names"" expanded and updated with current technology."
3,". . . And the other foot kicking me in the face, over and over.","I checked this book out because I totally dug Vinge's other novels, A Fire Upon The Deep, and A Deepness In The Sky. Hereafter I will refer to those as ""the good ones."" Rainbow's End is not a good one. It is bad. Bad enough that I didn't finish, and I even finished Spin, which I hated and found utterly boring, so that should give you an idea.I could not bring myself to care about the characters, especially the ""protagonist"" who would more aptly be described as a ""total jerk."" There are too many of them, as well. The antagonist fares no better: I can't believe that his duplicity would go undetected and I don't even buy his reasons for doing what he does. There was no action in the first two hundred pages, nothing to care about, and that's where I stopped reading."
2,"Like most other negative reviewers, I couldn't get through it","There's far better cyberpunk, and far better Vinge out there. Skip this one. All the other 2-star reviewers are right on."
3,"Amazon insists I haven't reviewed this, so I'll do it again.","...So here is [my] review...of Liam's solo effort from the 60's: I have now downgraded it to three stars, from four, after many additional listenings. He has a great voice, but this effort has too many dirge-like offerings, and several songs are about twice as long as needed. Liam's duet releases with Tommy Makem are far superior, as are most of his releases with his brothers. So there! I love the Clancy Brothers, but prefer them in a bunch rather than one voice at a time."
3,"Good, but he was even better with his brothers and Makem","I bought this 1960's solo release by Liam just a month ago, out of love and loyalty. I have been a Clancy Brothers' fan since the very early l960's. This is a pleasant outing, but it lacks the high fun of the best of the Clancy Brothers' recordings. It also lacks the power of an album Liam did with Tommy Makem, called ""The Makem and Clancy Collection"" (Shanachie 52001.) Buy that one ahead of this one, if it is available. Liam is in good voice on his Vanguard solo offering, but the material he chose either does not have the impact it had in 1965, or just is not as compelling as the songs he performed with the group."
4,"Good, but pricey","I believe that DHA provides the best healthy brain-developing benefits when consumed in natural form from foods rich in healthy fats--i.e. fish and whole grains. However, during pregnancy when fish eating was generally limited due to mercury risk, I took these in hopes of helping my little ones' brains be the best they could be.Did they work? I could say yes, because both of our boys were early talkers and readers, smart and precocious. But most likely it is a result of other factors (genes, our involvement, and our overall healthy diet) than the DHA supplement. I'm not sure about the validity of any claims or effectiveness, but I would take them again since its hard to know!I graded them 4 out of 5 stars because they are somewhat pricey for the # of caps in the package."
5,GOOD STUFF,"I took this product with my last pregnancy, number six. I and our entire family have commented over and over how our little girl seems intelligent way beyond the point that any of our other kids were at 3 years old. I didn't think much of it at the time, just that my OB reccommended it and it was something new since my last pregnancy 10 years earlier. I would highly reccommend this supplement, a little pricey but the size of the pills was easy for me to handle so I took it regularly."
1,Crushed Beetles in a Prenatal Supplement?,"This product contains carmine color, also known as cochineal extract. This sounds innocuous enough, but do you know what it is? BEETLES. Yes, crushed beetle extract. Cochineal is a nice way of saying crushed female cactus beetles.It makes absolutely no sense for the manufacturer to add this non-nutritive, potentially dangerous substance to a product for pregnant women. Not only does adding carmine (beetle) extract render the product non-kosher and non-vegetarian , it causes severe allergic reactions in some people. (Please visit the FDA website for more information.) The 'yuck' factor alone is enough to turn those seeking a DHA supplement away in disgust.Mashed beetles with that DHA for you, mom-to-be? No thank you!"
3,"David Mould, Bangkok","Having read this straight off the back of Hard Landing and being 100 or so pages in it feels exactly the same. Dan ""Spider"" Shepherd is assigned on once case and it morphs into another.It's still a good read but I would recommend that you change authors in between or switch to another book outside the series"
2,Nothing special,"Leather's new character/hero, Dan Shepperd is predictable even boring. Leather's writing was characterized by excitement and unpredictability and an element of ""noir"". Shepperd is almost a ""goody two shoes"" persona,with his beliefs and fixations of good and bad, his loyalty to SAS, his loyal ex buddies and thousand more cliches, etc etc etc, making his Soft Target and Hard Landing strong candidates for the worst books he had ever written.His previous work(i.e double tap,long shot,Tunnel rats,hungry ghost etc) were exemplary novels,interesting,keeping you on the edge,page turners,not merely satisfied with Hollywood type scenarios of good and evil ,whereas good must always prevail.I sincerely hope that Stephen Leather gets a grip, and drops the Dan Shepperd ,""good cop"" ""great hero"" bla,bla,bla, character and gets back on track to what he does best-great writing"
3,auto part acdelco assembly switch,"The product was as described, well packed and a timely delivery . It was for a 13 yr old truck and I was happy to find it!"
2,Its not that great of a game.,"I wasn't a big fan of the Burnout series. I tried to like this game. I just wanted a causal racing game that didn't involve power ups. People were telling me to buy the game but when I did, I wanted my money back.Graphics, sound, controls, & music are great. Can't complain about that. The gameplay is what I didn't like. To much emphases on getting a power meter for super speed and hitting cars. The computer would always beat me many times. Even when I put the game on easy mode. I felt frustrated and couldn't take it anymore.If your a fan of the Burnout series, pick it up. For casual racing fans you probably will want to skip this and go somewhere else."
4,"CRASHING, EXPLOSIONS, AWESOME 8.5 OUT OF 10","Though this game is not as good as Burnout Revenge, it's still a lot of fun to play even if it is missing some things like online play and crash mode. Still it's a fun tide-over till until Burnout Paradise hits the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. The crashes are still great to watch, and this time when you crash you can blow up your car to take out an opponent or to just raise hell among the commuters by destroying a lot of things. The soundtrack is still solid even if there are some songs that don't belong(Why is the girlfriend song from Avril Lavigne on here?). Burnout has always been the leader in car destruction, and this game proves to be no different, and still stands above pale imitators(Ahem, Full Auto, I'm looking at you). Crashing cars never really gets old if done right and this is a prime example of how it'll never gets old."
3,A Pain,"Very nice amp, plenty of power to drive two 10"" woofers in a 14' X 28' room for stereo music, movies & Wii.The only negative is the power switch is on the volume control, so every time you use the amp you must re-adjust the level. Or leave it on all of the time"
4,25 watts,"This is a a good little amp, gets a little hot, but runs great. My only issue is the gain/on-off knob, they should be separated."
3,Randomly stops working,"I've had this for about a year. I could tell after I first hooked it up that it is not a quality item. I have it hooked up to a single subwoofer and am using the low level input plugged into the left channel only for single channel. The sub will faintly play a local radio station unless the speaker wires are painstakingly placed. It also cause a noticeable hum in the sub at lower volumes. The worst problem is that it will sometimes just stop working for now reason. It will appear to be on, but no sound will come out at any volume. The only way to fix it is to unplug and replug it, just turning it off doesn't help. Sometimes I can use it many times over several days before it stops working, other times it stops after 5 minutes. From visual inspection, it doesn't appear to have any leaking capacitors, but that's about as far as my electronic diagnosing skills go."
2,DOA,"Seller shipped promptly and unit arrived reasonably well-packed.I pulled my system down to install this, only to find that it was dead. No output from either channel, regardless of connection scheme. Two hours wasted.At least the seller took it back and issued credit promptly. I'll give two stars because of the seller's prompt refund."
2,Okay sound but poor response curve properties.,"This amp has a good sound, but if you are looking to drive signals in the 40 to 80 Hz range, you should consider a different amplifier. This amplifier does not have a flat response curve, and with the crossover adjustment set to the highest range (180 Hz) the amplifier starts to attenuate as high as 200 Hz. By the time you reach the lower frequency range, the attenuation is very high, making this subwoofer amp a poor choice for subwoofers."
4,Very Cool Movie,This is a great movie to add to your anime collection but if u get part 2 be sure to get part 1 as well to complete the set.
1,CRACKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"AFTER ABOUT TWO USES THE CAST IRON CRACKED DOWN THE MIDDLE. I TOOK IT BACK TO LOWES AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY ALL ARE DOING THIS. GREAT IDEA, POOR MATERIALS."
4,this is a great purchase,"I have loved this since I received it. A bit tedious to put together but worth it once it's done. I have not had the cracking experienced by others fortunately. This is a great, deep pit that holds a lot of wood and allows you to enjoy the outdoors well into the early hours of the morning. The grill attachment holds a lot of food and works out nicely with the slot that allows you to keep adding wood without having to remove the grill from the pit. The only downfall was that on the first use the little hook that holds the handle and the handle itself blew out from the heat so that is no longer helpful but you can easily pull it around by the frame. No biggie but a better weld would have been helpful. This is one of my best purchases of the summer! Enjoy!"
1,"""A design bomb""","Bought this product at our local Lowe's store, took it home; a pain to put together. Built our first fire in it to test, after about five minutes, heard a loud popping sound! The cast iron frame had cracked right at one of the bottom screws, the crack meandered up half the bowl! Took it back to Lowe's and exchanged for another one. I always give products a second chance. Put it together again, built a test fire, in about two minutes, POP, POP. The bottom had cracked again, this time all across the entire bowl. These were not surface cracks; the entire bowl separated."
1,Poor manufacturing quality,"I received the subject blanket within the expected timeframe. When I inspected the merchandise, I could see that this item was a ""second"". It had many major pulls and runs in the weaving. Some of the pulls were over 1"" in length. Did not cut them since this would have caused unraveling of the weave. I suspect that this blanket will not last through even one washing. My advice is that if you want first class merchandise, do not buy from the store that distributes this merchandise. I also feel that Amazon should review their suppliers more closely. The rating for this product should actually be ""0"" stars!"
4,Tush Cush,"The opening could be a wee bit larger. Overall, I find the size and covering quite satisfactory. It was great to find a 2"" cushion. Usually the cushions are too high for the wheelchair."
2,Blessed Child,"I like Dekker books, but this one failed to reach the level I am used to in his work. I wonder what age group he was writing for? It seemed simplistic and unimaginative for a writer of his caliber. Efforts to put the child in danger were expected and the outcome was predictable, as was the romantic attachment between the two adult characters who shared the spotlight with him.I have already forgotten their names."
4,Great read,Highly recommended. Very fast moving and enlightening. Grabs your heart and doesn't let go.Another terrific book by the authors. I hope there are more.
5,Awesome,"Anything Ted Dekker writes is outstanding but Blessed Child and the follow up book will touch your heart. In Blessed Child, points are made that make you realize how the world influences our lives and how often not for the good. TV should be limited and children encouraged to play and use their minds and hearts. I wish I could give everyone a copy of this book.S.Dillon--Austin,Tx"
4,Entertaining read,"Blessed Child is a fast moving and entertaining novel. I read the book as part of a reading group; however, it's better suited to evening reading than group discussion. Once you start reading, it will prove impossible not to spend all of your spare time trying to get to the end of book. Scattered among the much larger messages one would expect in a Dekker book, there are small nuggets of thoughtful issues that are probably even more significant to the average Christian."
3,Decent Religious Fiction,"I find it hard to criticize a book with a message as pure and revealing as the one in Blessed Child, but it is a major let-down for serious fiction readers. The plot is extremely predictable and you have to read 200 pages to get to any exciting content. I read the book purely for the fact that Bill Bright's name is on the cover, and without that fact it would be a terrible book.It's a good read, but definently not a must-read!"
4,A good visual reference,I ordered this book as a reference . I turn to it when I want to design a piece of jewelry with an antique flavor.Some of the photos are in black and white but I can still get inspiration from the designs.
3,I liked it!,"Some of the other reviews considered this to be a pretty poorly written book, but I found it to be very entertaining and the ending was a real surprise. The Simeon Chamber is not on the level of a Grisham or Turow novel, but I'd put it right there with a writer like William Bernhardt. It's a quick read and it is a page-turner. You may also learn a little about Sir Francis Drake that you didn't learn in high school or college. Give it a try."
2,Don't Waste your time,"The Simeon Chamber is the second Steve Martini book I have read (Compelling Evidence being the first) and I was thoroughly disappointed. The book tells the story of Sam Bogardus, a lawyer who is hired on what seems to be a simple adoption case at first. All of a sudden the plot evolves into a search for the lost journals of Francis Drake as well as trying to solve a murder that is 30 years past. Martini just fails to build a believable chain of events. Again, don't waste your time with this book. I will definitely give Martini another chance, because I found Compelling Evidence to be outstanding"
1,Stale Candy,I gave this as a Christmas gift and boy was I embarrassed. This box must have been a left over from a year ago or more. This was the first bad buy I have had thru Amazon. The chocolate was definitely old. We wound up pitching it in the trash.Had always enjoyed Barton's Chocolate and wsa looking forward to this purchase. Very disappointed.
5,The freshest album of 1997?,"This is an instant classic..Too bad these guys have been so overlooked (and I mean badly). With ex members of The Screaming Trees and Soundgarden this is a true ""Seattle Super Group"". If you listen to this album, I dare you to define their sound....Go ahead try it...You've never heard anything like this..I promise you won't be disappointed...do it!!! It's 1999 and I'm still raving about these guys for christsake!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Loved the book!,"From the first page this book had me thrilled!!! I don't know what it was, but I really enjoyed it! Maybe it was the way it was written, the period of time in which it was ambiented, maybe it was him or maybe it was Rosalind, but I really enjoyed this book.Maybe there were some plots that were easly seen out (as who was the killer, or why the mother of Rosalind's stepbrother was ill), but the book is superb even having it into account.Now I'm reading the second book of the ""Wild Wulfs"" and I think I'm enjoying it even more than the first one... XDRecommended lecture if you like your romances spiced with paranormal!"
2,"Tea: I do believe, yes, I don't want any more, thanks.","Overall I had high hopes for this one, and it just didn't cut the mustard..While I thought the idea was interesting it was the weak story and characters that did me in. There just wasn't much that hooked me into the story and the characters, making it a ho-hum story. Unfortunate.Therefore I'd consider it a very light werewolf romance. If don't care much about depth or the foundation of a story, or you just want something 'light to read, then you might enjoy this book.If you're looking for something with a lot more meat in it, I'd recommend Keri Arthur (Riley Jensen series) or Patricia Briggs (Mercy series)."
1,Don't bother wasting your money,"I bought this book because I like werewolves and I like romance. Werewolves offer infinite possibilities for authors, given their complexity. Unfortunately I was fooled by a pretty cover! There is minimal plot movement, the characters are incredibly stereotyped and two dimensional, and the ending is just plain banal. Perhaps the author was attempting a gothic tale like Wuthering Heights, but she failed miserably. This is the kind of book that reaffirms all the jokes that people make about women who read romance novels. On the plus side, she didn't spell any words wrong. Hardcore readers will be disappointed."
1,So disappointed,"I am sorry to disagree with other reviews on this book but I was horribly disappointed. I love Sherrilyn Kenyon, MaryJanice Davidson, Christine Feehan etc and reading these reviews on Wild Wufs of London (love this subtitle) I was so excited to run out and purchase this book.It is slow, the dialogue stilted, the characters completely one dimensional. What the hero sees in the heroine is beyond me.I was hoping for more ambience, more interaction between the characters. Why they fall in love other than being physically attracted to each other, you never see."
2,Woof Wulf,The cover was the best part of the book. Though the historical aspects were beautifully described the plot itself was average & predictable and the characters were too similar to so many other paranormal romance heroes. There was really nothing new here.
4,The Wild Wulfs of London,"This was a very enjoyable read. Fast paced, dark, romantic with a very engaging story line. For a first time author, Thompson has done a great job. Can't wait to read the next installment of the Wulf's."
3,"Adequate, but nothing special.","If I had to describe writing by the numbers with an example, I would provide a copy of this book. It is not a terrible book, but lovers of the genre who read a LOT of paranormals (particularly the wolf/werewolf variety) will not be moved by this story. I can't say that I was compelled by the characters or the plot. It's not boring per say or I would have put it down...its just that I've read a million books like this...its the same old story without the newish twist. I will say this, the author does exhibit a certain amount of skill, now she just needs a more original story...or at least an unexpected twist. Oh heck, tell the same story, but tell it in a new way."
1,looks are deceiving,"Owned one of these mugs for 5 months. On Christmas day, poured hot water into it for tea, and the mug split right down a seam where the handle is! Luckily my daughter and I avoided getting burned by the water. I always hand washed the item, so wonder about it's usablity."
5,Excellent,"Excellent, I love this hat, fit very well, the color is great and material tooI recommed thi product to every fans"
2,hat,"I like the design however the hat keeps popping off my head, I've havent been able to get it to fit right even after a few washings , and I dont have a big head. My 2 year old toddler wears it with out any issues."
4,Interesting,"Very interesting work. Excellent evocation of alien topography and society. A little intense in description of the feelings and impressions of the progragonist, but perhaps that was intentional in order to produce contrast with the soul-less inhabitants...?When this was written, in 1935, Nazism was not yet fully exposed, nor was communism. It is remarkable that the author set up the dichotomy so clearly between communal society and individual effort and reward.Creative, interesting and worthwhile"
1,not fair,"These prints were originally painted by my dad, Kirt Brown. The company that he sold his paintings to make prints from doesn't tell him about all of the prints they actually sell to people. this isn't a limited edition. I'm sure there is more than one print left of this set out there somewhere unknown, and none of the money is going to the actual artist, Kirt Brown. I'd save your money to support the actual artist."
2,Tepid,"If you are into subtleties and rare tantalization, this is for you. This is especially so if the central actress 'can do no wrong'. Unfortunately, in my case, the movie was a mystery. The story's purpose was unclear and the vague suggestions of sensuality were, let's just say, vague. Would I watch it again? I doubt it.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
1,not for Celica GTS 1991,"I had to return this thing twice for because it just wont fit into my 1991 celica.After 2nd return i just went to autozone and DONE DEAL.Autozone sure was not cheap, but it gave me what i needed."
3,The Standard Deviants probe deeper into Sociology,"Continuing their info-dense intro to Sociology, the young STANDARD DEVIANTS comedy troupe offers Volume 2 (taped way back in 1999). As with Vol. 1, the troupe is joined here by Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the laugh-queen of sex talk. She brings erudition to the game, but delivers it with her perpetual grin: just the right blend of jollity and sober fact for a Standard Deviants production. Purchasers need to know that the troupe works hard -- too hard? -- at getting laughs. Thus, the often sophomoric results WON'T tickle every viewer's ribs.Even so, the show's writers clearly know their subject. But DON'T think to absorb this tape in one sitting -- for the material is too concentrated, and it's force-fed to the viewer far too fast. Instead, watch the tape in 12-to-15 minute segments, with time out for discussion and/or ""digestion."""
4,Basic Info for Young Wanna Be Fathers,"A good basic starter on male sexual potency. This book is really written for the the wanna be fathers or maothers who may be having problem having a baby and want to know the man's role in that problem. However, it is basic information that most people who have been keeping up with new information on male sexual performance or andropause have read in books like ""The Testosteron Syndrome,"" ""Super T,"" or Maximize Your Vitality and Potency - For Men Over 40."" If you are looking for information on male sexuality in an aging man - this book is not for you."
5,Great book - tough topics!,"This book got into the stuff no one likes to talk about, but that men need to know. At the start, the myths opened my eyes to truths about what happens as men grow older, and it clues us in to changes we can make to our daily lives.At first look, the book seems to be about assisting men with fertility problems, but it is in reality a book about sexuality. My ""vitality"" has improved significantly since taking the advice in this book. I'm thinner, more active, and, well, everything works better!One piece of advise, though. The second half of the introduction is really hard to get through. Skip it. Read through the other chapters."
2,Not that helpful,I don't think there's enough out there about male factor infertility. I think this book covers the main topics but not very in depth. It's just ok. Maybe a good jumping off point but not very helpful for us.
1,Poor quality item,"This product is poster paper, magazine paper. This is not an ""Uncut Sheet"". I'm very disappointed with this purchase. This product is far away from the quality of a Bicycle deck. As an international customer, It doesn't make sense to return the item. Wasted money..."
4,"Altogether, a very good buy","""Multimedia servers"" is actually an introduction to the subject of implementing rich contents applications over data-networks, focusing on the design of high-bandwidth servers. The treatment of the many disciplines (e.g. communications, server architectures, storage issues, stream scheduling) is not well balanced. A lot of the volume is devoted to storage, while hardware/system architecture is briefly discussed. However, since this book seems to be a pioneering work in this emerging field, I find it most useful for any newcomer to the subject. The book includes a wealth of references as well as many field and simulation statistics results, being crucial to any developer in the field. Altogether, a very good buy."
4,Good introductory text,This book is a good introduction to the theoretical aspects of multimedia server technology. The book helps in providing an idea about the various requirements for mutimedia servers and the schemes/algorithms used to satisfy these requirements. However this book is not for someone who wants to set up a video server using commercial software and is looking for tips on how to configure it. This book is suitable for someone who is interested in conducting research on multimedia servers or wants some background knowledge on the topic.
5,Be careful when purchasing this book and CD set.,"First, I have a lady friend who is more than eager to play fiddle. This book fit her needs and complimented her more 'traditional' lessons, too. Deliver was timely.THE WARNING: One Amazon seller sells the book without the CD and the price is not reduced. I made the mistake of buying his/her offering and it is sheer trickery at best. So, be very careful, take your time, read the full description, so that you know you are getting BOTH the CD and the BOOK."
2,Can you read music?,"This is a nice book--if you can read music. I thought it would be written in actual fiddle tab, finger notation--1234, for each note. So unless you can read music and know what chords are, then this will probably be fine for you."
2,Help a beginner out man!,"I feel some major things were left out of this book, especially for a beginner. For example, how to tune the fiddle, correct finger positions(it only suggests asking an expert, what's the book for?!) and how to read the tablature/sheet music in the book. I'm not impressed."
3,Okay,"This car is kind of annoying because when you turn it on, the wheels are constantly moving backwards and to the left unless you push the button on the remote. And it's kind of loud, so we don't play with it very often, but my son likes it."
5,Rocky's complete saga,My husband loves these movies. Good way for him to unwind from the day and get pumped for the next one. What a bargain! Best price anywhere!
4,Good collection,Each movie was just I remembered it. Nice nostalgia. Good collection and very good price! (under $30)
4,Awesome set of movies,"I don't usually watch movies that have even a little bit to do with sports of any kind...but these movies have far more to offer than just one senseless fight after another. I will admit, however, that the 5th movie could easily be left out without diminishing the overall story at all. If you are interested in special features you will be, as another reviewer mentioned, disappointed. If, however, you are only interested in the movies, this set should satisfy."
1,Boo to Sony for no Special Features,"At least they could have put the two disc special editions in here, instead of the one disc. This reeks of laziness. They will probably put together another box set in a few years with more bonus features, so hold off on buying this."
4,Excellent box for excellent price,"Great box, comes with Rocky Balboa.I missed the special features stuff."
2,I just love Rocky!!,"I can't get enough of Rocky and enjoy having the complete collection. This is the first time I veiwed ""Rocky Balboa"" which is the perfect completion of the saga. ""Yo Adrian"" Enjoy the ride!"
1,cant not review something never received,how dare amazon ask me to review a product i never received - focus on credited my account back and dealing with idiots who sell products through you; the order which should have arrived 10 -14 days after ordering (which is unbelievable to begin with) never arrived.... re ordered it from Walmart and had it in 2 days...... my suggestion dont order through Amazon this is about the 4th time i had a bad experience with Amazon and the last; considering I only ordered through Amazon about 6 times - do the math order--from known stores much better experience...
2,Rocky Series,I love the Rocky series and was excited to receive it. Until I realized 2 of the discs are messed up and won't play. I'm hoping the set I received is just a fluke. This is the first time I've received defective product from amazon. Hoping it will be the last time.
3,MISPACKED ITEM,"I love the ROCKY movies, I mean they are my favorite, every movie is great. except when I bought the new ROCKY collection I went to watch ROCKY IV and was very displeased to find out that my collection had been packed with 2 copies of ROCKY V. I had to sepperatley order ROCK IV. So be careful when ordering"
5,This Movie Will Change Your Life and The World,"Fighting is the only sport that mirrors life itself. In basketball, football, and others, you don't have a chance to win if you're 20 points behind and there is 1 second left on the clock. Yet, in fighting, and in life, even if you have been knocked down, messed up, and left behind, you still can turn it all around with just one more punch...one more inch...one more step...Rocky is the hero within all of us."
4,Good,"This is good movie, but it is not the greatest sports film of all time. It works because it is a basic story about a guy who has been a loser all his life getting the opportunity of a lifetime to finally make something of himself. It also works as a love story between two people who basically are misfits finding each other and falling in love. The only complaint I have about it is that it is too basic a story and the characters have been seen in movies like this before. The main thing that saves it is the fact that even though Rocky doesn't win the big fight at the end, he still comes off as a winner at the end. However, the main thing that ruins this film's reputation are the endless sequels that came after it. If they had stopped at two, maybe I would accept this film as a classic."
2,Carcass on a major label,"Necroticism was the last great Carcass album. Heartwork is not something I would recommend. Gone are the low vocals, so we only have the higher pitches vocals done by Jeff Walker (I believe). Im sorry, but the dual vocal style is what helped make Carcass so unique. Plain and simple, this album can not compare to Necroticism or Symphonies of Sickness. While this album might be hailed by many as the best Carcass album ever, I must disagree. This album is over-produced and it has Carcass traits, but it is not close to their best."
5,Technical Death Metal Supreme,"Heartwork by Carcass was an album that I owned many years ago. For one reason or another we were separated, but recently reunited. What a fantastic album! The performance is excellently produced. The song's theme's and lyrical content are thought provoking. And, you'll need a dictionary to figure out some of the lyrics (common of Carcass lyrics) so you'll be smarter after listening!"
3,Not compatable with Bestop Sunrider Soft top,"I own the Bestop Sunrider soft top. I assumed you could use the same ridge on the front for installation. Unfortunately you can't, so you can't use the same hardware to install the bikini top as the soft top. I returned the item."
2,Nothing close to spectacular.,"The album isn't even close to being as good as any 'Bright Eyes' albums. Conor Oberst in 'Commander Venus' isn't being pushed to his lyrical heighths. Lyrically, ""Uneventful Vacation"" is horrible. As far as sound goes, it's decent. If you really, really need to wallow in your sadness, I suggest listening to this. As far as ""Emo"" music goes, the album's alright; has some okay tracks. Don't waiste your time on this though if you're looking for something like ""Digital Ash..."" or ""Lifted..."". I'll say it once, and I will say it again; 'Bright Eyes' and 'Commander Venus' aren't close to sounding anything alike. If they didn't have the same singer, they'd have no similarities."
4,Good lady bug house but could buy it else where cheaper,"Great ladybug house, and easy to use and maintain but unlike the detail says, it did not come with a pre-drilled hole for mounting. Not a big deal but not as specified. best used with ladybug lure. Other one on AMAZON says for about 15 bucks cheaper and same product."
5,Wife loves these!,"Bought this DVD pack for my wife who's a big ""chik-flick"" fan of these movies. The Lake House especially is one of her favorites."
3,Make sure you want one this high,"The 7 inch wedge didn't seem quite like enough so I got this 10-inch wedge. It's a little bit too much height for me for a comfortable sleep, so I would suggest you find something to replicate the feeling before purchasing, as they are not cheap."
5,My first Ian & Sylvia recording,"Ian was singing out of one channel and Sylvia was harmonizing in the other. Mixed into both was some great country/folk instrumentation.I bought this album sometime around 1967-68 with no prior knowledge of who these people were. I only knew Vanguard recordings were usually folk music and I was getting into that genre at the time. I remember putting the disc on the record player and my jaw dropped. I think I had a happy, dumb look on my face for the entire album. Outstanding harmonies, incredible melodies, superb musicianship...heaven.I don't have this on CD right now and my LP was worn out long ago. I plan on buying the Ian & Sylvia complete Vanguard recordings box set eventually. I recommend that to someone, like myself, who wants to get reacquainted with their incredible music. If you only want to sample their sounds, I recommend this recording highly (along with ""So Much For Dreaming""). This is the Good Stuff."
4,a nice bag,"It's a nice bag, a little to stiff to put much in it, the leather is also very soft, so thats nice until you use it and it gets all messed up. Other than that a good buy"
4,Very nice subwoofer,Nice tight bass for a small project I am building. Price for performance is very good. I took off one star because the first unit I received was not working and had to send back. Seller was easy to work with on this issue and I was very pleased with how it was handled.
1,No longevity,"Power supply went out after short period of use. I enjoyed it up to that time, but this should have lasted much longer."
4,Great sub for the price,I have owned this product for about 2 years. I have used it in a mid size living room along with the polk rm10 and onkyo 606 receiver. I was very disappointed in the onkyo receiver but this sub has done a very good job and puts out plenty of bass for my use. I normally watch bd and listen to rock music with my home ent sys. If there is one thing I don't like about the sub it's that it has a small light on the front of it that is always on when in use. I wish more of my home ent sys did not display lights.
3,Nothing to say for that price,"The sound is just not bad, but when I turn the output loud, it will produce some messy noise. But for that price, what I can say?"
1,"Tried two of these, neither worked.","Maybe it's just my luck but the subwoofer produced no sound. Called Onkyo, after getting shuttled around a bit, talked to a tech who asked me to unplug cable from receiver, and tap it, telling my I shuold hear something on my sub. After getting nothing, he confirmed its a bad unit. Returned for a replacement Onkyo, and hooked up using high quality subwoofer cable to my Onkyo TX-SR508 Receiver, and STILL NO SOUND. Tried hooking up to my Squeezebox, with no sound. My volume on the sub was cranked, and crossover lowered. Anyone else go through this nightmare?"
2,"lack of control, will turn off automatically","This product works well and produce a sound of acceptable quality. However when no signal is sent from the receiver, it will turn off automatically (nothing you can do about it) and this is extremely annoying since it will produce a click and you will notice a big difference in the sound every time there is signal in the input and the subwoofer turns on again. It should have a switch to maintain the subwoofer on all the time, as is the case in most powered subwoofers. This is typically not a problem if you are listening to some musical genres at high volumes, but is very annoying when watching movies or even listening to music at low volumes. Two stars only because of the price."
1,broke first 30 minutes 2 of them at the same time,only had them hooked up 2 a 3000 watt recvier pyle pro 4 30 minutes and both of them quit working at the same time tried 2 return them right after it happened 30 minutes after i got them wanted charge me 50 dollars just 2 ship 1 speaker then i talked them about the product people u have 2 ship them 2 told me it happens a lot 2 them so they charge 4 labor and maybe some parts by the time i paid 4 all that could have bought a brand new set my product review dont buy reason why there so cheap you'll have 2 pay 4 it later i u can track the people who warrenty it lol
1,Crummy rattling from the box/grill,"I was pretty excited about this subwoofer when I got it. The was a powerful unit for the price. There is tons of power...no question about that. The problem is if I turn the volume up half-way or more, the box/grill rattle very loud. I've found many other people online have had the same problem. I was trying to give it a chance because I really wanted to keep it. The rattle drove me nuts and no amount of adjustment could fix it. Unfortunately I called just a few days after the 30 days were up and the distributor (J&R world???)wouldn't even talk to me about the problem...they said I had to call Onkyo for service. I called Onkyo...they wouldn't take it back or replace it...my only option is to take it in to an authorized service place that is 2 hours away. They were total jerks about it over the phone. Apperantly I was speaking to Mr. Onkyo himself because he said there was no supervisor higher than him I could talk to. Crappy rattle with crappy service."
5,Onkyo Powered Subwoofer,"Onkyo SKW-204 Powered SubwooferI bought this unit for my 7.1 surround system and having recently purchased a receiver from Onkyo I found that the price was good for what I wanted and the size was good for my home theater room. So far I have not been dissapointed by the performance of this unit. It handles very well the low ranges encountered in movie soundtracks, as well as 5.1 surround satellite HDTV programs. NO complaints so far. This unit packs a punch for it's size."
5,Literally a good bang for your buck!,"I was looking for a little more punch in my system. All my equipment is Onkyo and I have five JBL Northridge series speakers. Although speakers are supposed to be matched, reseach turned up that it was not necessary with a subwoofer which really worked out to my benefit as all the reviews I read on the JBL subwoofers in my price range had very poor ratings. So I decided to look at the Onkyo, the ratings were good and I could see (or should I say hear) why. I am very happy with the choice I made and would recommend it."
3,Not Bad,I've always like Onkyo products and I bought this one with out hearing it. It does good at low levels and even in some louder cases but occaisionlly the cabinet will rattle if you want really heavy bass. The price was great and I would recommend it if you are not going for extreme volumes.
4,This Sub Rocks,I have had this sub about a month or so and I love it. I have it hooked up to a Pioneer VSX-1017TXV Home Theater Receiver along with seven Sony Bravia speakers. Let me tell you this sub has amazing bass. The only drawback is that it tends to rattle when playing music with extreme bass but other than that it sounds great. Movies come alive with this thing. I did alot of research on different subs before I bought this one and for the money you can't beat it. It has volume and frequency controls along with a phase switch on the back so you have complete control of how you want it to sound. It is also one of the best looking subs on the market. If you want a great sub without spending a fortune then you should get this one.
1,Poor,"I ordered this subwoofer which was packed from the original box and an outside box with ample packing. It worked great for 4 days, then nothing. Reading the owners manual I noticed that there is a special fuse which may be the problem but it is inside the subwoofer and must be serviced by the factory. Since I threw away the boxes (no room to keep them) I can't return it. Sounded great for four days. Now I guess I will go into it and take it apart to try and replace a fuse. Unbelievable. Don't buy it. I may try the Polk Audio 10"" subwoofer next. By the way, I have a small Onkyo amp and system with two small bookshelf speakers which was never turned up too loud."
5,Terrific item,"Added great depth to my bookshelf speakers, and with my new Onkyo receiver, I spend hours listening to the system."
4,"good sound, good price",A nice addition to a home theater. All speakers are boston acoustics except this and it mixes nicely. Good footprint. Good price.
3,A decent sub for the price.,"The sub itself has a nice sound quality at low levels. When you try to really crank it up it is not as loud as I would have liked. A little distorton creeps in at high volume levels. As a compliment to a large system with a few woofers that dont play low frequencys very well it does an excellent job. But as a stand alone woofer I think some would be a bit dissapointed. The other complaint that I have is that the grill likes to really rattle and buzz around 120 hertz.I do like the volume control and the x-over controls. Set the x-over control at 100 Hertz or lower depending on what other speakers you are using with this unit, Keep the volume around half throttle and enjoy."
4,Great Sub Woofer,I am a musician and really appreciate the bass capability of this speaker. It adds a lot to my studio sound system.
4,OLD Audiophile,"Just a a note about the Onkyo SKW-204: The factory has choosen the dubious ""Dynamic"" power rating. Using the old engineer's ""rule of thumb:"" 60% of input power for the true RMS output power, I would guess this is really about 80 watts RMS. But this is a good low powered sub for acoustical music. I have the Polk PSW10 in another room, which I also use for acoustical music and consider it a better $$ deal. Remembering that it takes 10 times the power to produce a doubling of sound pressure(10 decibles), I would consider the Polk too. Neither sub will give you an ""F-18 Hornet 'Fly by' with the after burner on"" in a large room, but it is still an XLNT low powered sub. ENJOY !!"
1,javier,"is an imitation, not recommend,,, odor disappears in seconds ----- ---- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- -"
3,Wrong description,"The product is mislabeled; the description is ""Swiss Army Eau de Toilette for Women by Swiss Army.""It was purchased for my daughter and it is a man's scent. The box does not say for Him or her. As it turns out I could have been more careful, there is another product that is a lighter shade of blue that says ""...for Her"" on the box."
1,Swiss Mountain streams bedammed.,"For years I have partook in various lotions and commercially marketed man-fumes. However, I want to be perfectly clear here. Swiss Army Mountain Water has changed me in a terribly profound way. Until SAM Dubya, I was content pleasing only myself, and I abhorred creating nicknames. I wore smells solely for me. Little smellebrations without guest lists. It was the perfect marriage of aesthetics and economy. A tiny bottle of Stetson could last a decade...as I would apply the hint of a dab of a dash only to the inside of each nostril. No more. No less. Others did not help pay, so I sought not their benefit. I read the Little Red Hen. I digress. Alas, That is over now. Swiss Army Mountain Water has me wanting to waft. Yes, I now seek to waft. Damn you, SWAM Water. I award you one star for forcing me to care again."
4,Wonderful Story,"I really enjoyed reading this book, the characters are so interesting. I love hearing them described through the love of Hope.I recommend this book for any young girl who likes history."
2,Two of the weak series 2 episodes,"Series 2 was well below the usual Simspons standard, as the characterisation was still mvoing from its initial status onto what we've loved for years. And neither of these episodes are up to scratch, both being well short of good jokes (only the 'Snow Day' scenes really stand out). And the Treehouse of Horror episode was a poor start."
3,Bart Gets an F?,"Why is Bart Gets an F considered one of the best of the Simpsons? It was one of the worst episodes I have ever seen! Treehouse of Horror was good, but Bart Gets an F? If any of you haven't seen the Simpsons before, don't get the wrong impression on the series by this episode. It was a lowpoint in the series."
2,Let the BUYER BEWARE!!!,"While Dover's many scores represent an amazing value across the musical repertoire, their collection and reprint of the Litolff Edition of the Beethoven Symphonies was a mistake. For the casual buyer they are workable, but not for serious use in performance, as they are riddled with editorial mistakes and problems. Purchaser would be better advised to find a set of the miniature (octavo-sized) Bärenreiter critical scores. They are bound just as nicely and the paper is of excellent quality. I use the full-size Bärenreiter set when I conduct my orchestra."
3,Good Value for Casual Readers,"These Dover score editions are best known for their low prices. For the Beethoven symphonies, these are pretty much just reproductions of the 1865 Litolff edition, which contains numerous mistakes that were corrected in later, better editions. The 9x12 format is good for the full score format, making it easy to view all the orchestral parts at the same time. The note heads are big enough to be clearly legible.Knowing the deficiency of the source edition, my major complaint is there are no measure numbers so it's a big inconvenience for anyone wishing to study specific points in the score.BTW, all these are available for free download as PDF on [...]. But for me, having these in a book format beats having to print out page after page of PDF which gets messy."
5,Worth Having,"These scores (as well as those of the other symphonies) are worth having. Serious students of music can take invaluable lessons from Beethoven's knowledge of counterpoint, orchestration, dynamics, melody, harmony, and form. Additionally these are great listening aids, pointing out ""Nebenstimmen"" (""secondary voices"") that might not be noticed at first listen. This way one can learn to enjoy Beethoven (and other music) as many melodies intertwining into a larger fabric."
4,From Lists to Poems,"I bought this book (List Poem by Larry Fagan) as a companion to the book List Your Self. I intend to use them in tandem for inspiration in writing, and perhaps teaching, list poetry. Fagan's book is full of wonderful examples from well-known poets and from school children, and since he is aiming his teaching at grade school children the instructions couldn't be clearer. The book also has a bibliography of addition sources. As a list maker from way back, now I can turn my lists into poetry!"
1,Don't bother with this book!,"I am currently travelling through Peru, Boliva, Chile and Argentina and if you are only taking one guide book (which you probably would since they are relatively heavy), I *strongly* suggest that you do not waste your time with this book.The accomodation listings are inconsistent - eg: they list whether some hostels have private bathroom and then don't bother mentioning it for others. The maps are hopeless and miss out important information. Can you imagine standing on a crowded Cusco street staring at the map looking for the main bus station, only to find that there is an arrow on the side of the map with a caption 'to bus station, airport'.Go with the Lonely Planet Shoestring guide - not perfect, but miles ahead of the Rough Guide."
2,RE: Parasol DDD-RR Dew Drop Deluxe,"This hummingbird feeder is beautiful and as soon as I filled it and set it out, I had visitors wanting to feed! The one catch I wasn't pleased with is that the tip has a slow drip...which stains any wood deck, and attracts ants to the sugar water."
1,Disapointing,"This feeder was given to me as a gift, but it has been a rather frustrating one. Despite following the directions to fill it entirely full to create a vacuum, the contents of the feeder poured out onto my patio. It may be good looking, but if you want to save yourself a hassle, I suggested buying the more tried and true feeders."
1,blue cloud mess!!!,The hummingbird continually leaks - doesn't matter if it is hot or cold out . . .
2,"beautiful, but not functional","I bought two of these and they look so beautiful in my garden, but they drip like sieves. I called the company and ordered new stoppers - they didn't help. I've had to shelve them."
1,Dew Drop Deluxe? DON'T!,"This bird feeder leaks way too much! I filled it with sugar water and left it out for the hummingbirds and within 10 minutes all of the water had dripped out onto the floor. Before I noticed and could clean it up, Kenna and Zimbobby (my cats)had gotten into it, and for the rest of the afternoon, they tore around my house, knocking over all manner of things. Whacked out on some kind of crazy feline sugar high. Thanks a lot."
4,Allow some time for hummingbirds to adjust,"We love this feeder for its beauty and the way if fits in the landscape among all the green things in our garden. But it took the birds a little while to take to it. The flower feeder buttons are quite small. They ignored it for a full week--and we have a lot of hummers in our garden. Then we took the old style (unattractive) glass bottle with red plastic flowers and hung it next to the DewDrop. Eventually, a few tried out the new one. Then we removed the old one. Now all is well, and we will definitely add another DewDrop next year."
1,junk,"I read the reviews about leaking, but purchased it anyway... I saw that if you fill it completely full and quickly flip it you will have no issues. Baloney! The feeder is held together by a rubber stopper. If you push the stopper in tight on both ends, no sugar water enters for the hummers. If you don't attach it tightly it leaks, or worse yet, the bottoms drops out and you lose all the sugar water. I tossed the piece of junk within 1 week. Trust the reviews and avoid this product."
2,Pretty but impractical,"I purchased a beautiful glass hummingbird feeder thinking it would replace the ugly plastic red ones that you see everywhere. It is very pretty, but it does gradually leak the solution over a short period of time. I would not recommend purchase of this feeder unless you just want a decorative piece in your garden that you fill infrequently."
2,An Interesting proposal,"The ideas in this book are good, if a reader would glean from it that the Lord is telling us to keep up fellowship with our brothers and sisters in Christ, even more seeing the emminent return of Christ and the rapture. Not only should we experience Christ in small gatherings of believers, but also in the community of the Body of Christ, which is in the church."
4,Useful Tutorial,I have several of the Missing Manual series and found them much better than the scant information software publishers provide these days. The Dreamweaver Missing Manual works you through all aspects of the program with detailed tutorials covering everything from CSS programming to setting up ecommerce sites.BW Tucson AZ
5,Real time saver,"This book could be a real time saver. It is a great resource to learn from and later on, when you start working on some real project,... having it in the drawer makes you want never to shut it again. This book really saved me a lot of trouble and time looking for possible reason why something is not working as it should. And the way how it is written ... Pleasure to read it."
5,Very informative book,One of the best things about Dreamweaver 8 The Missing Manual is that they have an online source where you can download files so you can practice chapter by chapter. Also the tutorials are very clear and informative. Great book.
5,Nice program,"I haven't gotten very far into the book, but I can already tell that this manual is very comprehensive. It is simple to use and explains everything thoroughly. I noticed that even though I did free shipping, the book arrived well before the approximate arrival date it gave me, which was nice. I would reccomend this book for anyone."
2,"OK book, but not the best for website creation in Dreamweaver","I bought this book hoping it would be all that I would need to build my sites with cleanly and yet some complexity. I've found that I'm often at the library borrowing many other Dreamweaver 8 titles and finding them much more helpful. I've found finding specific help in this book a bit difficult, and the chapter progression doesn't really make sense. My main background is design and the arts - but I don't think this book is too technical for me... just counter-intuitive in its structure. I much prefer the Sitepoint books so far... even the Dreamweaver for Dummies are at least just as good, and much less expensive. Would not recommend to buy - maybe try it at your library first."
5,Thank god for this book.,"I've never taken the time to review anything on the web before and have always been amazed by the numbers of people who do. That being said, I had to tell people how much I love this book. The last site I designed was a tiny static site back in 2001 using golive and I recently committed to building two database sites. I went though many, many books + tutorials and none are as good as this one. [...]."
5,Very informative,"Well written, easy to follow, and thorough for a beginner to intermediate user of Dreamweaver."
3,dreamweaver for dummy,"if u have graphic background but have never touched Dreamweaver, this is a good book for u but u don't have to read words by words. Only go thru the tutorial and u would be fine.If u don't have graphic background, this is your life saver. Super details like missing manual and easy english. Good for ESL students.For advance user who know Dreamweaver before, it has some advance techniques or professional tricks on ""tips"" or u have to read words by words to find it.don't worry to lose resource files in tutorial. instead of using CD, it uses web download. Save ur home space and access anywhere anytime."
1,Broken Card shuffler,"My Card shuffler was purchased for an elderly person who can know longer shuffle cards, but enjoys playing solitaireIt arrived broken the back boaard was off, needed to be glue gunned back on, small clear plastic pieces broken off.Would not recommend purchasing this item, very disappointed."
1,Cheap and flimsy,When I received this item not only was the wood chipped but it was also not shuffling properly. I am disappointed in tis product.
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!,"The saying you get what you pay for doesn't apply to this shuffler. I bought it as a gift and the first time my friend used it...I was so embarassed. Not only did if hang up when almost to the end of the shuffle but at times it would completely throw out some of the cards. It was so aggravating that my friend decided not even to use it. I would have sent it back but since it was a gift my friend has already thrown out the box. I went out and bought a replacement for her, at a cheaper price, and it works great."
1,Broken!!,Broken right out of the box.....only one side spun the cards through.A piece of junk just like the reviews warned but I thought I'd take achance. Into the trash can!!
5,Great Product,"I belong to a senior's card group, many of us not able to shuffle cards, because of arthritis. This product makes it easier for us to enjoy our weekly game.Thank You!!Pat Condit"
4,Works pretty good,"You can't beat this item for the price it's offered at. I liked this one because it had wood pieces to it which made it look a little sturdier than other all plastic types. The wood is not actually solid wood. It is particle board coated with a wood looking contact paper. The rest of the construction is all plastic. However, it does do a pretty good job at shuffling cards. Sure, it gets hang ups and sometimes the cards get stuck but that's nothing a little shimmy can't fix. I usually just tap the top and shimmy the plastic tray and the cards all fall into place. Show me a non-professional cheap card shuffler that doesn't get hang ups sometimes! It takes 4 AA batteries (not included). Over all it's well worth the money and I do recommend it."
2,CARD SHUFFLER DOESN'T SHUFFLE WELL,NOT A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. CHEAP IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD. CARDS GET STUCK IN THE SHUFFLER AND NEED TO BE REMOVED BY HAND.
3,automatic card shuffler,"When i recived this product in the mail the sides were not attached. I hot glued them back on and it works fine. I used the shuffler at a poker night and it was good, it made mixing up the cards a bit easier when drinking."
2,Disappointed in shuffle.,The cards hang up fairly often and it doesn't do a very fine shuffle. The cards clunk together in groups instead of a fine mix.
3,great for the price,"we have trouble shuffling cards and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a high end shuffler. this is pretty standard and not really durable, but for the price. it operates great. if you were to drop it off the table, it would break cause not made out of highend wood or plastic. wouldn't get it for kids to use. Again, great for the price."
1,Did not work,We tried the unit about a dozen times. First we cut a fresh deck exactly in half placing each half on each side. When the card 'shuffler' ran them through they were in exactly the same order. We then proceeded to try it over and over and it was always in the same order. I think it would be great if you want to cheat...but not to actually have a card shuffler. I plan to send the item back.
1,DA VINCI WOOD GRAIN DELUXE CARD SHUFFLER,"THIS IS MY SECOND REVIEW OF THIS PRODUCT AND I HAVE GOTTEN NO FEED BACK FROM THE FIRST REVIEW. EVEN THOUGH THE SHUFFLER LOOKS GOOD, IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK - IT DOES NOT WORK!I PURCHASED 2 SHUFFLERS (ONE WAS A GIFT),SO WITH POSTAGE, I AM OUT OVER $40.00!"
3,Da Vinci Deck Shuffler,"We ordered two, one for us and one for a gift. The plastic 'wood grain' is glued to the body of the item. One was fine, but the glue on the other was all dried out. The top lifts right off. When passing to the next dealer, you have to be careful to hang on to the bottom. The cards tend to get stuck in the middle, probably due to the ill-fitting sides. Quite disappointed."
3,balding chia pet,"My daughter was really excited to received this. However, when we followed the directions exactly, there were bald spots on it when the Chia started to sprout. It was rather disappointing in the end, and ended up in the garbage after 3 weeks.She is now trying to decide what her next Chia pet is going to be though, because it was fun watching it grow."
5,White Elephant Exchange,This gift was bought for a White Elephant gift exchange and was a great hit and got a lot of laughs! Thanks Much
3,A little disappointing...,"Cute gnome, and we worked with it, but most of the seeds slipped down the beard before they could sprout, so it came in sparsely--maybe we made the seed mixture too watery? Some seeds did sprout, but the water we added in at the top leaked out through the porous body A LOT, so it had to stay in it's little tray. That had to be dumped every few days, then refilled. Now, a month later, the gnome is getting moldy. We were going to try it again with the additional seeds left from the packet--there were plenty of those, but will have to scrub the little guy first to get him cleaned up to try again."
3,Its okay,I bought this product for my son who thought this would be very fun to grow- we followed the directions and it hasnt really grown except for a few sprigs- Thank goodness it comes with lots of seeds to try again!
1,Never Received,Order was never received with almost no tracking information available. I guess I just threw my money away on this one!
5,Great gift!,I got this as a Christmas gift for someone who is a gnome lover. It was such a hit! She loved it!
5,Laurel's world,"When you have seen these beautiful mugs, etc., well there just isn't much else to say but 'wow'. I have been collecting her art for some time. These mugs are a marvelous addition."
2,Charm,I ordered this charm for my husband for Christmas. He is a huge football fan! Thought it would be perfect gift! The price was very high so I was expecting a very nice piece of jewelry. I was not very satisfied with what I received. It is hollow and light very small hard to even see. But by the time I received it I had no choice but to give it to my husband it was Christmas Eve. So buyer beware it is very expensive and you don't get much!
5,Shaft meets Austin Powers,I saw this movie at the Tribecca Film Festival a few years ago and my sides were hurting from laughing so much. I can't wait for the animated series to debut.
5,great movie,I can watch this movie everynight. too funny just too funny. the cartoon on cartoon network is cool also. this is great
2,"This is a 15 minute promo, not the actual movie!!!","I can't wait to see this movie (well, I guess I can wait a bit, since it's been out for years). However, I don't think everyone else who reviewed this Amazon item was paying attention. Reviewers appear to be talking about the actual movie Black Dynamite, whereas this is just a 15 minute promo about the movie. One reviewer says he saw this at the Tribecca Film Festival... Ha, I hope you actually saw the movie itself, not this little promo.Hopefully my review will save you some time if you thought you were about to see the actual movie Black Dynamite... This iust a promo about the movie."
1,"It's going to get better, it's going to....","I'll give these guys credit for hiring a good promo company to do the trailer. It actually looked funny in the promo. I got a used copy for $2.50(should have been a sign) and watched 5 minutes of this terrible non-funnyness telling myself it will get better. At 10 minutes, I said it again. At the 15 minute mark, I took it out of the player and tossed into the pile of crap movies I give away to people I don't like that well."
5,facial exfoliant cream,"unique formula is very good for leaving skin complex lookinghealthy and young , and exfoliates all skin impurities and blackheads, it uses natural high quality ingredients so il like it, its atelast must chekit out, and i like the price also usualy the price on the rivage home page is higher for this cream , and almost all rivage products you find em here in amazon much cheaper price ,"
5,My First Tarot Book,"It was 2004 or 2005 when I came across this book, and I must say that it is a huge shame that it is no longer published. I feel very lucky to have a copy, as this was my first book on tarot. It is exceedingly simple to read, not nearly as overwhelming as other introductory books that I have read. The layout is also clean, simple, and spread out quite nicely, along with beautifully whimsical illustrations that puts a budding reader at ease. I have my own tarot deck, and while I am not a certified tarot reader, I do enjoy reading my cards, and always have this book by my side to consult. It has been an immense aid to me, and my readings turn out quite accurate! If one asks me for a reference on tarot, I would definitely recommend this book. It is such a shame it is no longer produced."
3,Looked ok but...,"I recieved it with a bent up cover and it was supposed to be new - from Amazon. A bit of a disappointment - I returned it. From what I viewed of the book, it looked like it had potential."
5,This Rooster Really Crows For Kids,"Laura Vaccaro Seeger and Pete Seeger have produced a wonderful, entertaining book for young children who are learning about language. Our under-two-year-old nephew was fascinated by both the recorded song on the CD and the colorful illustrations. The simple text and the progession of vivid pictures of cows, ducks, pigs and sheep builds to an amusing finale. The sturdy spiral binding will stand up to many readings and singalongs."
3,Loved Malta,"What I loved about this book was the description of Malta. It made me want to visit which I have since done. I re-read the book before my trip just for the descriptions and went to many of the places Laura went to. Hamilton's descriptions of place were excellent and accurate and added immensely to the emotion of visiting Malta. The story line was okay but not great but it does set the stage for later books by explaining how she and Rob meet. I read all of her books, more for the description of locale than for the story line. Hamilton's writing creates amazing images of locale and to me this is one of the true joys of reading. And for all of you history buffs, take a trip to Malta, you'll love it."
2,What's this writer's problem?,"This is my second Lyn Hamilton Lara McClintock mystery. I didn't much care for the first one, but I thought, hey, maybe she got better. Well, she got more facile. Once again the reseach is fine and the subject matter interesting. Once again the set-up is fine and the resolution flaccid. And, please, Lyn, spare us the introductory feminism. We're grownups now. It seems to me that Hamilton is writing a book about a book, keeping herself at arm's length from material that ought to be be better served. And yet... and yet, I've already bought the 3rd book in the series hoping against hope that what Lyn Hamilton's got going for her as a writer will find someplace to go."
4,Lara Mc Clintoch finally in Europe,"Mr. Galea, a very good customer of Lara, buys some antiques in her shop, but needs here to put everything in his maltese house for an important party. Paying her well for that, she can't refuse to fly to Malta and arrange that. But what a surprise when he arrives dead at destination inside a piece of furniture. Lara is suspected of the murder, so she has to investigate to find out the real one.Still with an archeological link, still a good story, but still not at the level of the first of her. You will see the real Lyn Hamilton again in the next book, THE CELTIC RIDDLE, but why not read all of them in the chronological order, it is much better !"
1,Be careful!! This is a biliography and not BIOGRAPHY,"I bought the book originally thought that is a book on the life of Gauss. How disappointed when I recieved it and found that it is actually a BIBLIOGRAPHY!!! Unless you are doing re-search, do not buy this book."
2,Not worth almost $40 bucks,"It is a very pretty locket, but for 38 bucks, I was expecting it to feel a little more sturdy. It's really just costume jewelry. It feels cheap. When the charms of the necklace hit each other, it sounds like plastic or really thin metal. To be honest, I have seen $12 necklaces like this at Charming Charlie's or Claire's. I hate writing unfavorable reviews, but shoppers should know what they are getting."
5,Simply beautiful,"I bought this like a year ago and still looks new, I love it and wear it every chance I get. Looks rally good and I have received a lot of complements."
4,Glitzy,"This is really cute in person. Nice and heavy, but do not buy if you are looking for something super-antique-like. It is very polished and silvery. Makes a jingle noise when you wear it because the little charms bounce around, but I like that. The locket will hold a picture, but I haven't attempted it yet. Overall, I really like this necklace."
3,Disappointed,1928 Jewelry usually has an aged look it. This piece is very shiny and looks cheap. I gave it to my 6 yr old to play with.
4,Great Railroad Adventures-Epic Train Journeys,"This is very good, particularly the Australian railroad trip portion. The Canadian and South African portions were not quite up to the standard of quality provided for the Australian part."
2,A Little too Close to be Funny,"A laughing friend thrust this book into my hands, saying that it had really made him laugh. I took it home, and sat down with it, and started to chuckle. But by the end of the book, I wasn't laughing nearly as much as I thought I would.Here's the deal: It's not really all that funny, because although it's right on the nose and pokes a lot of fun at our own gay ideosyncracies, the book is also showing just how shallow, lacking, and fundamentally messed up gay culture is.Now, I'm certainly not going to say that this wasn't a pleasure to read, it just left me with a melancholy feeling: Gosh, isn't it sad that we're pretty much just a joke. It was fun, but sometimes bitter, light, but sometimes kind of mean, this book seems to adeptly sum up the so-called gay culture: Laughable, but not all that funny sometimes, and very often pretty damned sad and lacking in self-esteem."
3,Entertaining but somewhat stereotypical.,"First lesson before you pick up this book to know? Learn to laugh at yourself. Where the book is entertaining, it does list some pretty stereotypical gay/lesbian attributes from listening to dance music and even going to gay bars.Don't take the book too seriously. It is meant to be funny."
4,"Great flashlight, less than secure case clip.","The flashlight is well made and especially suitable for aviation because of the single red LED. The red light could be used, however, for any situation when you did't want to trash your night vision. I was able to easily distinguish between the white and red push button switches in the dark because one has a textured surface and the other is smooth. The light comes in a nice black nylon case but the spring clip is a somewhat precarious way to attach the light. I had it clipped to my belt and lost it while I was on my bicycle. I will replace the light but won't attach it to my belt anymore."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This was something I just thought I had to have. It is really cute, but we have never used it. I don't know about your baby, but mine does not like to have his clothes changed over and over. After his bath, he likes to be dry and in the outfit he is going to be in for the day or night. Overall, this robe is not very useful, but it looks cute hanging in the bathroom!"
1,Baby does not like to be changed repeatedly.,"I agree with the previous user. I had no use for my robe either. I ended up giving the baby showers instead of baths. We never even used the baby bathtub. Then after the shower I put the robe over his head to dry his hair and wrapped the robe around the baby. I never put his arms in because he was not tolerant of that. Then we wrapped him in a towel and layed him down. We just had enough time to put his diaper on and dress him. NOW, that being said, if it were summer time, we might just let him wear the robe to the pool but I can't really justify the use of a robe for a baby now that we have seen how babies act after bathing."
1,"Cute to look at, but not a great item","Well, my son could only fit in it for a few months, maybe till he was 2 months at the most (maybe three but i doubt it..), it also is very thin and the inside doesn't feel comfortable to me, I just wasn't happy with it at all...although I feel it is very cute though"
