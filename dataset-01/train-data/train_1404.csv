4,Collar review,Very nice heavy weight collar. I have had these fur savers before and they work. I would like to be able to find this in a slightly smaller version.
2,"Cool concept, poor execution","The concept to explore some of the lesser known alien races of 40K universe was very solid, but this book really didn't deliver on the little details. The kroot anatomy is wrong (the picture depicts their hands wrong and they don't have noses). Tau are also messed up (their feet). Like many of GW's products, there doesn't appear to be any consistency when it comes to checking the small things and this book suffers greatly because of it."
4,WORTH THE WAIT...,I really enjoy all of Jacquelin Thomas books... It was kinda of heard to get into this book at first but once I did I loved it. I can't wait to read about the rest of A.C.'s sister and maybe her father too.. It was cool to slip in on the Ramson. Just to know they are fine. The reason I didn't give this book a 5 stars due to the romace sceens was lacking due to the fact the chartars had a past and a new start I thought the sceens could have been a lil' hotter. If you have read about the Ramson's then you will remember A.C from Matt & Katlin's story. If not go get and catch up... Good work mrs Thomas
2,Disappointment,"45 minutes on a grinder, 30 minutes on various grades of sand paper, and 40 minutes on my diamond sharpening stones made this completely unusable tool function like it should. Hindsight...I would pay for my time back. I usually love Two Cherries tools, but this one took WAY too much time tuning up for the work I do. North Bay Forge is the way to go. If you are only using this tool to strip bark off a log, then this tool will work. If you are using it for woodworking be prepared to put in your time."
1,Elvis Presley Gladiators: The 1974 elvis Karate Legacy Project,"While it was very interesting to see Elvis in some capacity other than concert footage or in a character role on film, the sound quality is terrible. The film is narrated by Wayne Carman (karate expert involved with Elvis and his guys during the filming of this ""project"")who mentioned NUMEROUS times throughout the disappointing 49 minutes in runtime of the film that being around Elvis in this time was a ""mountain-top experience"". I did understand before purchase this was raw material. I did not understand that the viewer WOULD NOT be able to actually hear Elvis and the other people (Red West, Dave Hebler, Kang Ree..etc..)On a more positive note, I did enjoy the ""out-takes"" from Elvis' 68 Comeback Special, and the souvenir postcards included in the package."
3,After so many years...,"Wayne Carman is a martial artist out of Branson, Missouri and did train with Elvis and really was a fan of Elvis as a person. The Elvis he knew was a young, healthy, polite southern boy without the weight or, as far as Wayne knew, the drugs. I first met him 10 years ago and he'd been trying to get this footage out for years even then.My understanding was that Elvis wanted this footage to be part of a documentary about the expanding full contact scene in the 70's. What we see is as far as it got. My old home footage would be laughed at, we only care because it's The King. Not an awesome video but take it for what it's worth. It's a chance to see Elvis off the stage and as a human being.I didn't want to rate this since I know Mr. Carman but it won't let me post without it. I'm going to give it 3 stars but only out of neccessity, not a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Just thought potential buyers might like some background and context."
4,Finally,"Heard so much about this never completed film project over the last 35+ years and after seeing it, it was fun to recognize some of the selected clips that had been used in other Elvis documentaries (mostly Linda Thompson). It is really a series of home movies and the guy doing the narrating keeps repeating the same comments over and over. After 10 minutes of his repetitive comments, I finished watching it with Elvis music in the background, I had to ""mute"" the narrator. I very much enjoyed the film."
3,Gladiators,I usually love all of Elvis's dvds but this one did not come up to the standard I like. Elvis looked tired or medicated and you could tell he was talking but you couldn't hear what he was saying as the dvd was being narrated by someone else and the narrator was all you could hear. I was a little disappointed in the dvd.
2,Not so hot,"OK this product is out of production probably for a reason. It failed after only a few days. I had originally bought it for connecting my Laptop to my embroidery machine. I had just gotten all the connections together to do so and in between I had been using it as a key board connection which this machine doesn't on a regular basis allow. But did through this nicely. Just as I was going to connect up the rest of the equipment it went down. So, it lasted about 15 days. I could not regain a link in any fashion though the power light was working it never came up as connected again in the device manager even after repeated attempts in various fashions most orthodox some not. If I could get one that worked as advertised I'd recommend it to anyone. As is I am left disappointed."
4,well done kids yoga,"This is a well done kids yoga class. The target is for preschoolers. The students in my special education class enjoy it. I find the preschool classroom in the background a bit distracting, but seeing the kids participate on the video encourages my students to try."
3,A Good Basic Book,"Facilitation Made Easy is a good basic book for the beginning facilitator. It provides step by step instruction on how to set up your workshop. It provides a good overview of listening skills, conflict resolution, how to keep things moving along, managing time and many other useful skills. I used it as a guideline for my first Joint Application Development workshop and got very good reviews on the workshop. I recommend the book to anyone who is responsible for bringing a diverse group of people together for the purpose of getting something accomplished."
2,Disapointing,"Purchased this as a gift and was really disappointed in the quality. Points were not stitched close enough to edges and caught on the slightly too small stones. Colors are beautiful, but had to return for a better set. Can't really reccommend it except as a really cheap toy."
4,Mink at the Top of His Game,"This is the best Mink Deville compilation. While the first Mink Deville cd is a must-have, the subsequent cd's have been rather spotty. With this cd you get the finest cuts from the first cd plus the strongest cuts from his later work. Mink Deville's music is not assembly-line soul, but heart-felt, genuine music. This music is a great combination of R&B and rock."
4,Good night club music.,"This guy can sing anything. Some of what he does is not appealing to me and some is. He mixes blues, jazz, rock, country and country rock. Listen to the 30 second previews to decide."
4,Songs I missed first time out worth hearing,Unique artist with a sound that melds the 50's with the 70's without Springsteen's take no prisoners attack. Melody rocks electric. Crooning love's hunger passion and loss this corner boy's no push over for corporate radio signals. The CD has holding power and Willie's performances are captured fresh and lean. Recording sounds new and his execution is genuine. Seems to me rock n roll may have missed his sparks but his fire still burns.
5,Throttle Position Sensor cures idling problems.,"This item completely and immediately cured my Chevrolet S10 (2.2L engine). It would either stall out, or would idle at very high RPMs. The problem was listed in the OBD diagnosis."
1,Poor quality,"Item out of the box failed! Took to dealership and they said it was not a genuine Delphi part. Beware, do not buy this part!!!"
2,More miss fire,This part causes more engine miss fire than the cheap one. I finally reserved to the cheaper one. I regretted returned the same one back to Pepboy.
2,Hard to get on and off,"I was hoping to find a sleeve that protected well without costing too much. This seemed to be right, plus a great color. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get it on and off. If you are using for transporting back and forth from the office, it would be great. If you need to go through airport security, I would not recommend it unless you want to dedicate a few minutes just to get the computer out and then back into the sleeve."
4,Just what you need,"I like this case- it is not bulky but still feels substantial enough to protect my computer. It fits great on a 17 inch iBook. The reversable construction is versitle and the seams for each side both look good. I left a kiwi in the bottom of my backpack and it got squashed on the case. I just rinsed the case with water and the kiwi came out; the case dried quickly.I would like for the closure to seal more tightly. I know the computer will not fall out under normal circumstances, but it is just not as sleek as it could be.Overall, I think it is a great case. It is quite reasonably priced and has everything you need and nothing you don't."
5,Great case for macbook,This is just a great case for the macbook. Perfect fit and very durable. Highly recommended!
5,"it is what it is... the smallest case possible, nothing more","I bought this case because I am constantly bring my laptop to different rooms of the house and after I am finished, I never want to bring it back to my room. With this case, I feel safe leaving it for the most part anywhere without fears of it getting scratched. The second reason I bought the case was to reduce my laptop to about the size of a book in my backpack, which it does. I debated between this case and the logitech case with the pocket in front (for my charger), but I wanted the SMALLEST CASE POSSIBLE. Well worth the $20 or so."
3,its ok for the price,"Pros: The color is beautiful,fit 13 inch, no zippers so no scratchsCons: the cap is loose and it doesn't close nicely like in the photo"
4,Nice fit - flap doesn't lay flat,"I used to have a sleeve with a zipper. Then the zipper left some scratches and gouges in my computer, so now I won't have a zippered sleeve. This sleeve is nice and soft. The fit on my 13"" MacBook is great. However, with the computer in, the flap doesn't lay flat. I've only just received this product, so maybe there's some break-in that needs to be done. Regardless - the flap does cover everything to protect it, so I'm not worried. The colors are nice and either side looks great. I kind of wish they had a version with two vastly different colors like a crazy loud green and a subdued brown, but I got two browns."
4,Good Cover,"I like this case because it is fairly inexpensive and does a good job. It is reversible, different colors, there are many varieties of colors available, and it fits fine. I use it with a 13-inch MacBook and it fits. The flap doesn't really lay flat when the laptop is in it, but it does cover the entire laptop. The material is soft but thick. I shut the laptop down every time I put it in the case, because once I just put it on ""sleep"" and it seemed to overheat."
4,"Nice snug pocket, though doesn't close completely","This is the perfect sleeve to provide a little more protection for my 13"" Macbook--it's easy to slide the computer in and out, and there are no zippers, velcro, or snaps to scratch the exterior. I would feel comfortable using it to transport my Macbook to meetings and other events within walking distance or a short car ride from my office. However, the foldover flap doesn't close as tightly as it could, so if you need to travel on an airplane, or walk outside with it in inclement weather, I'd advise getting something else that would protect it more completely--I got an enclosed shoulder bag for carrying my Macbook (sleeve and all) in those instances."
4,I can never think of a good title.....,"This album was an impulse buy. I was familiar with Stanko and Komeda by name only, saw it in the store and thought ""why not?"" And I've now spent the past week listening to it over and over. All the compositions (the music is highly compositional with only brief solos) have a nocturnal feel. The adventurous ""Night-Time"" suite sounds like a drunken odyssey through darkened city streets (hmmm...I meant that as a compliment). The title track is some of the loneliest music I've ever heard, with a particularily powerful solo by Stanko. The three different arrangements of ""Sleep Safe"" are eerily soothing , while ""The Witch"" is just simply eerie. So, like the reviewer before me, I'd say this album has a definite ""haunting"" quality that sticks with you for a long time, heavily atmospheric, with reserved, introspective performances that frequently flare up passionately in intense passages. Highly recommended."
4,Haunting Beauty,"The melodies on this CD are beautiful. This CD presents the music of Krzysztof Komeda, best known for his score for Rosemary's Baby. I had never heard of him, now I want to hear all his music. ""Night-time, Day-time Requiuem"" has some superb tenor sax work. Terje Rypdal has some strong guitar in ""Sleep Safe and Warm"".All the arrangements are beautifully done. My favorite song is ""Ballada"": you follow Tomasz Stanko's trumpet as it takes you away to a tranquil place. Stanko paints beautiful soundscapes with Komeda's music. Late at night it's a journey of haunting beauty..."
4,Aligned cooperation,"Uniquely moody piece of atmospheric restraint, understated experimentation, and chillingly effective homage."
3,Dated Information,"Rather dated information that I'm not too sure about. The book stresses that we should rely on the government after an emergency but I'm afraid that ""if"" the government could stand up to a large scale attack that they would be stretched too thin to be useful. Still, it is information, albeit from many years ago."
3,To short and out of date,"The book is far too short for properly educating your self against all un forseable disaster readiness ,It's only a hand out from the civil defense. It really doesn't deal with the world we inhabit today."
4,"Good, but missing major sections","I understand that it was written in 1968, but it seems a gross oversite that there is no inclusion of vampire or alien attack. I would think that in 1968 there would have been major concerns for invasion from those dern Martians. Perhaps a more current version would include the afore mentioned dilemma as well as a section regarding proper defense from and mitigation of zombie attack."
4,Little bit of a challenge but nice to play.,"As a senior citizen who still wants to play for personal enjoyment, this book has both easy and challenging pieces. It is filled with classical arrangements that I heard and played in my childhood when I took 7 years of piano lessons. It is a nice addition to my music library."
4,Very good sheet music book,I purchased this book because in it there ara many classical easy piano sheet music - and this is helping me in my practicing at the piano.
3,"Good for Beginners, but Use With CAUTION!","This book is a good deal for the money and has a good selection of classical music in it. If you are a beginner or want to play for fun, I recommend the book.If you are a beginner but you plan to become a good piano player, look elsewhere. The pieces are all simplified which is what I expected. Unfortunately, I found some of the pieces were harmonically inaccurate. For example, Grieg's Morning Song does not follow the chord progression of the actual piece. It uses a different chord progression (resulting in a slightly altered sound than the original) and this throws you off when playing it.If you're beginning in music but want to go far, buy another (more expensive) beginner's classical music book. If you're playing just for the fun of it and want to be able to play some of those difficult classical piano pieces, then by all means buy this book."
3,GREAT selections... Poor arrangements...,"The good:This book contains essential pieces that everypianist should know. It has 300 pages, and since it's spiral-bound itfits easily on your music rack. The notes are big and clear on high-quality paper.The bad:A lot of these pieces have been needlessly simplified or altered. I personally would rather spend the extra time to learn the ENTIRE compositions, and I was extremely disappointed to find how incomplete these are. But at least it offers some good practice.Also, anyone about to buy this book should realize that the word ""Easy"" in the title is misleading. This book is bordering intermediate-level. END"
3,what happened?,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of the bands new album, but was disappointed when it did not meet my high expectations.The Derailers are without a doubt one of the most talented bands anyone can see and hear. Their live shows are a blast to be a part of and they always seemed to capture that energy on their studio albums.However, this album does have that spirit . I really can't believe the band let it be overproduced by some mucky-muck who doesn't know crap. Try Reverb Deluxe, Jackpot, or Full Western Dress before you buy this one."
1,Not The Derailers I Knew and Loved,"An absolute travesty. By the time this record came out, the band seemed more interested in pushing ""The Derailers"" as a brand rather than the remarkable band they once were. Nashville production pushes the guitar to the bottom of the mix and hired guns write most of the material. It sounds to me like the band was trying to ""make it"" as some kind of Mavericks-type group, but in the process they destroyed what made them special.Stick with ""Jackpot"" or ""Reverb Deluxe."""
2,"C'mon guys, what's next?","I count myself as a Derailers fan because I love ""Jackpot"" and really enjoy ""Reverb Deluxe"". I like old-style country tunes with lyrics that take a little bit of thought to put together and maybe take a little to catch the meaning. But this record and the Derailers' last one contain so many obvious, banal tunes that I can barely stand to listen to them. With so many lines you can see coming from a mile away, it takes all the fun out of listening. For the record I realize that they didn't pen them all, and to their credit they don't fill their albums with covers of stuff like ""Hello Walls"". But I know enough Nashville songwriters to know that there is much better material available. On a high note, those Telecasters have never sounded better!"
4,Derailers,Bought as a gift after the cd was stolen from my husband's truck. CD came in excellent shape and took no time to get here.
4,mystro's review,"Well having listened to four (4) of the Derailer c/d's over thelast several years, and being very pleased with the Album ""TheRight Place"", i was not surprized by the quality of ""Here Come The Derailers"". Just a little bit more of your Love, and If thisis what you think you need are both very good songs. Here comesmy Baby sounds like classic Orbison.Having seen this band several times, I can say they are very exciting. Tony has a wonderful voice, and Brian just never misses on Guitar.mystro.....ohio"
1,There Goes the Derailers,"It never fails. In an attempt to expand their audience, this band has lost the feel and excitement that brought them an audience in the first place. Another great band gets ruined by a trip to Nashville. If you're interested in the Derailers, go with there earlier work -- this one's a coaster."
2,Repetitive,"Yes, this book has good, straight-forward answers to common questions, but it was simplistic almost to a child's level and was extremely repetitive. For a newbie, it's small enough to throw in a purse until one master's the new lifestyle choices."
2,High Price for a Generic Fit,"I purchased these floor mats for my 2004 Pontiac Aztek knowing Weathertech floor mats are suppose to be custom fit to the vehicle. I was surprised to see that the box said these also fit many other vehicles other than mine. I pulled the floor mats out of the box and immediately noticed that they were were identical but for opposite sides of the vehicle. The driver's side and passenger side are entirely different in shape and the rounded part of the mat did not fit well around the squared foot rest on the left side. These mats are nothing different than what you could go down to Wal-Mart and pick up for 1/3 of the price. I paid the premiere price so they would fit properly but now am going to end up sending them back. While the quality of the mat isn't in question the misleading photos and statement of ""custom fit"" is what irritates me."
2,Weathertech Floormat,"I ordered floormats that were supposed to fit a 2011 KIA Sedona EX. The web picture looked like it was the right shape. However, the actual product did not match the picture and did not fit my vehicle. I had to return it."
4,Tangerine Dream 'Alpha Centauri',"This album, is in my opinion, an excellent sample of german rock and especially german rock psychedelia. The first track ""Sunrise in the Third System"" begins with bird-like sounds followed by the synthesizer sounds which are prevalent all through the album. ""Alpha Centauri"" can be characterised as a proto-electronica work, however there are flutes, guitars and percussion which provide in tracks 2 and 3 (""Fly and Collision of Comas Sola"" and the title track ""Alpha Centauri""), a more natural sound.The bonus track ""Ultima Thule Part 1"" is a very beautiful piece, more rock-oriented with clear influences, in my opinion from groups like King Crimson or Procol Harum."
5,Lapsong Souchong Tea Review,I can not offer to much in this review. This was a gift to a good friend of ours from China. He said that it was like drinking a good tea next to an open fire.
3,Candid conversations with mystery's grandmaster,"Since 1958, Lawrence Block has been producing some of the best work in the mystery field: searing private eye novels, effervescent capers, and fascinating plunges into the depths of the criminal mind, all written in a unique and irresistable voice. In AFTER HOURS, Block submits to a series of intimate interviews about his characters and themes, his life, and his craft. From anecdotes about the vanished world of pulp mystery publishing to serious thoughts about how the best mystery novels transcend the genre, Block offers much that will be of interest to his readers. Also included in the book are a complete Block bibliography and the first reprinting in 40 years of Block's first short story, ""You Can't Lose."" AFTER HOURS may not be compelling for the casual Block reader, but for the hardcore fan it is a must."
2,amazing what can get published,"below chats up block - surely a magazine article but a book!there are some intersting tidbits along the lines of ""do you write in your underwear"" but for real understanding of block the reader must search elsewhere. below even shows lack of knowledge of some book contentsperhaps it's not below's failt. the genre should never have been invented. block even comments on this in the course of the interview but below doesn't even pick up on it. as a source of blockian humor ok."
5,Good exercise book,This is a very useful book to practice English grammar. It helps students who speak English as a second language to learn more about Standard English. I highly recommend the ESL students to buy this book.
4,"Very, very light and thin sock for running type activities","I bought these to wear with my golf shoes because I walk a lot of rounds in warm weather, but these are far too thin. I'm not saying that is a bad thing or good thing, its just that they are designed for the most minimal amount of cushioning and volume in your shoe. These would be perfect for running in warm weather, but just be warned that they are the thinnest pair of socks I've ever seen. I would not recommend them for golf."
1,did not receive what I ordered,"I received a different sock than the one I ordered. When I contacted the seller they assured me that they sent what I ordered. I forwarded to them the e-mail that Amazon sent me showing that I ordered something different than what I received. They then advised me that Amazon sent them the wrong order information. I've never has a problem with Amazon placing the wrong order. I did return the socks and got a refund, but I did not trust reordering the original sock that I wanted. This item was also part of a Christmas present and couldn't be used since it was too close to Christmas to replace."
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware. I ordered the paperback edition of Versos Sencillos (Diferencias) pictured and described above. This is a Spanish language edition, only. It does not contain an English translation of Marti's poetry, as suggested by the reviews and the information provided by Amazon regarding the translator. The reviewers who speak of the beauty of the translator's work are talking about a hard cover edition. This is not it. The single star rating reflects this error. Of course, Marti's poetry is worthy of 5 stars. It is extraordinary."
4,Good Introduction,"This CD set turned me on the Bob Dylan. The song, Abandoned Love, blew me away the first time that I heard it. Overall, it is a good collection with most of the big Bob Dylan songs on it."
3,so so,"I like about 50% of the songs. I'm glad I got it used, it is kind of expensive new. It has many B-sides and songs you would not normally hear on other Dylan albums. The song ""Up to Me"" has Blood on the Tracks style and a subtle, steady pace, it alone is a reason to get the cd."
3,"Uneven, a very tough listen","I had high hopes for this set but was disappointed. The BIG problem is the sequencing of the songs. This would be a much better collection if it was in chronological order. As it is, it is a very tough listen. The unreleased rare stuff is uneven and certainly not good as what is on Bootleg Vol. 1-3. The live version of Isis is AWFUL!!"
1,dont read on,Goodness gracious this is stuff that isnt on his other stuff if you want stuff thats not on other stuff you should buy this stuff but if you want the stuff thats already on other stuff you should stuff it.
5,Great Book for my Preschool Class,"This book does have quiet a few words, and at first that made me think it may not keep the interest of my preschool class. But I was wrong. They absolutely love this book. It is a great book that demonstrates friendship and teamwork. Do not hesitate to buy. It is well worth it. It has a great message that would be wonderful for a child of any age. Even adults who get stuck in a rut. Enjoy!"
4,"One person reading CD, but not boring.","I've read this book with my twin (4 y boys) before I purchased Book&Cd set version. Because my sons do really like the story so I'm sure that they'll like CD. However, I give this only 4 stars because I don't like the fact that it's one person reading. It's almost perfect, just put a guy's voice for a cat or a squirrel. The background music is fun. Anyway, it's a fun CD to listen in a car- journey. Many of my friends like it,too."
4,Makes me want to make soup!,"I like how the characters finally work together to create harmony. It's a great, simple lesson. The illustrations are very nice and I love the feel of the book. Great choice for the 4-8 set!"
5,Great for social skills groups!,"This is a fabulous book about sharing, making and keeping friends, and all of the feelings and dynamics which go along with working together. I use this in the Fall with my social skills group in the school where I work. The children love it! It generated great discussion about about friendship, cooperation, how to/not to fight, learning to share, changing roles in friendships, and feelings (anger, jealousy, guilt, etc., etc.). Then, we usually make a ""pumpkin"" (out of felt pieces) as a cooperative group activity--of course, the children have to make the pumpkin WITHOUT saying a word and WITHOUT a ""...squabble, a row, a racket, [or a] rumpus."" :-)"
4,My Daughter's Favorite Book,"My (almost) three year old daughter came home from preschool raving about this book. I bought it for us to enjoy at home and it is the only book she'll let me read. The illustrations are beautiful, and are greatly detailed. My daughter has most of the words memorized already, and has now developed an interest in bagpipes, banjos, and pumkins, of course..."
5,Gorgeous artwork from cover to end - and a fun story,When reading this book ...let your eyes linger deeply on each piece of artwork. The rich colours of autumn take me back to New England.
3,Hard to get Noodles,"Although this book has a lot of good ideas, I would caution people that it's difficult to get the noodle toys in bulk. This initially seems easy, but buying them at a regular toy store is expensive and you'll need a lot for the book's activities. Also, don't expect to find any in the winter time.I suggest checking you get a ""noodle-source"" before getting this book."
1,Not Happy,I was sent the wrong mousepad the 1st time. They then sent me another one to make up for it. That was the wrong one too. They have the correct skew on the website but it is attached to the wrong product in the wharehouse and refused to pull the correct one and mail it to me. I was not happy!
3,Make sure You get the CD with the book,"This book is easy to read, provides many practical training exercises, and explains all aspects of self-hypnosis in clear, simple language. For me, the downside is that this book should come with a CD, but there was NO CD in the pocket. There was no prior warning of this, and it detracted very much from the usefulness of this book. I hope the seller will take note of this. Otherwise, the book was in excellent order, the price was good, and I was very satisfied...except for the lack of the CD."
4,Comfortable sox,"I must wear some sort of sox at all times, and these sox do well both in the house with no shoes, or outside in shoes."
1,awful,These are so tight that I had to cut the elastic and that didn't workThe elastic cuts into you. Horrible and I am a small person!
3,quality?,Socks are just ok. I expected better quality for a Gold Toe product. Socks are on the thin side and I could have spent $4.00 and received better quality at Burlington's or any discount store.
2,"Washing shrinks, makes them hard.","After two or three washings, these socks shrank and became hard. Although I don't have diabetes, I want soft socks for my feet. Regretfully, this product doesn't fit my requirements. I asked for a refund."
4,An excellent overall guide,"This book offers a wonderful, comprehensive look at the world of F1. Readers are given a rare inside look at everything from car construction to the important role that fitness training plays in a driver's preparation. The text is simple and straightforward and, graphically, the book is a real treat."
1,"THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THIS DISC,""IS THAT ALL""?","Being a huge brand x fan,this recording was a bit of a disappointment.The only song on it that i liked was the first song on the disc with the crazy name.If youre looking for some inspiration or chops,youre not gonna find it on this one."
1,Is there anything about this that is familiar?,"This album was first released c. early 1980s, and it contains very little fresh material. Some of the tracks are simply remixes of older stuff. Brand X fans will recognize some of the fare from the Product album, such as the rhythm track from ""Soho"" played with a different melody, and ""A longer April"", which is exactly that. The only track I mildly enjoyed was ""TMIU-ATGA"", which is vaguely reminiscent of ""Why Should I lend you mine..."" from the Moroccan Roll album.I have heard anecdotally that Percy Jones thought this album was an embarrassment, and I agree with him. Don't bother with this one unless you are hard core and have to have all of Brand X's material."
1,Is There Anything Necessary About This Disc?,"I'm all for bonus tracks if they're good and/or revelatory, but unfortunately, the only thing this disc reveals was Brand X in its death throes. Very little Percy Jones on here, lots of Phil Collins trying to steer things into Pop-Land and a lot of rehashed ideas that were a bit anemic the first time around. Avoid this one unless you're a screaming die-hard completeist. Otherwise, stick to the good five-star stuff like ""Masques"" and ""Moroccan Roll""."
4,"What would YOU do if you found $640,000?","This is a very well written story about a man who finds an enormous amount of money, and his travails, as he goes from wanting to keep it, knowing he must return it, and the myriad of experiences he has while he was rich... for 48 hours. The author deftly describes emotions as well as realistic scenes from everyday life upended by extraordinary events. You think you know what you would do? Don't be so sure. Read this remarkable story about someone it really happened to."
4,Great Receipies,Are using it quite often used it tonight for supper love the book awesom waffle reciepies would buy from again
5,Great recipes and attractive to display.,Have tried several of the recipes - always good. Have gifted the book twice with a waffle maker and a couple of utensils - great shower gift. Biggest reason for me to own it - display it front and center of my cookbook collection. It is attractive and very small - a great addition with fabulous pictures to accompany delicious recipes.
4,great 2 cd set,"great two lps remastered on two cds, they sound better then ever before!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my only dissapointment was these have not included bonus tracks or b sides to singles or this would get 5 stars,,,,,,,, anyway great booklet and great classic albums from the legendary sahb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Drawing nearer made simple,"Drawing Near is a great devotional aid. It provides five Bible reading guides, a guided, scriptural prayer section for every day of the month, and a three level memory verse guide. For each day, it provides prayers, straight from scripture, in the areas of adoration, forgiveness, renewal, personal needs, prayers for others, affirmation, thanksgiving, and closing. It is an excellent tool for prayers of any age. After using this guide for a few weeks, the reader will indeed find him/herself drawing nearer to God. A great book."
5,Revolutionize your prayer life.,"I wore out my first copy of this. I understand it is out of print, but found the same book re-titled ""Strength for the Coming Days"". I like to keep at least a couple on hand to give away. The topical list with accompanying scripture made prayer much more interactive for me. Highly recommend Boa's approach to anyone interested in developing a more vibrant, effective prayer life."
2,These binoculars are a disappointment,"I""ve got 50 year's experience with good binoculars and wanted a knock-around, inexpensive pair that was waterproof, fit in my pocket like these clamshells, and had good optics (obviously). I've generally used Nikon and Bushnells, so I started with those. While these Nikons are light, waterproof, and well designed, the optics are not good, I tried three pair (including the 10x25s) over a total of two months and all three were out of alignment. They gave me headaches. I finally decided on Vortex Typhoons - which are a GREAT binocular for the money. I was amazed at the quality of the Vortex over the Nikons and Bushnells."
4,Happy with purchase because I knew what I was getting,"My 4 1/2 year old son is very happy and excited about this costume. He enjoys the hard hat and tool belt even without ""dressing up"" in the shirt and overalls. As a parent, I too am pleased with the costume. It is roomy enough to layer clothing underneth for trick or treating. I had no illusions about what kind of fabric the costume would be made of (very thin felt-like fabric) and therefore am pleased with quality and price."
2,"Fun at times, but mostly a disappointment","I was disappointed with the adaptation of Rosamunde's Pilcher's epic novel. The filmmakers simply did not have enough time to develop any of the characters. It is all ""tell"" and no ""show."" You are told that Judith wins the Cairn Cup, but are never shown her doing anything that would indicate why she deserves it. You never see the friendship between Loveday and Judith or develop. There are some good performances, such as the actor playing Tommy Mortimer and Peter O'Toole (greatly underused) and I liked what they did with the character of Jess, but overall, it is a disappointment."
3,Not a thing like the book,"This adaptation is not a bit like the book. They have changed characters, the names of characters, deaths, the ending! You never see Judith living in the Dower House. I might have enjoyed it more if I had not read the book. It is beautiful and evocative. But very disappointing if you think it will resemble the book in any way!"
1,What a mess,"I am so disappointed in the so-called ""adaptation"" of the wonderful book by Rosamonde Pilcher. It was a real massacre of the story and changed so many things that I finally gave it up. Why was Peter O-Toole made the star of the production when, in the book, he was one of the rather minor characters? I did not expect all the characters from the book to be in the film, but why were some thrown out just to insert new ones? I guess the script writers thought they were better writers than Pilcher - well, guess again. This movie is poorly acted amd worse written. If you love the book as I do, skip the movie."
2,Whatever happened to the story line?,"I thought the first DVD out of the set was pretty much to the plot of the book. But, whatever happened to Judith's old friend, Heather Warren, from Porthkerris?On the second DVD from the set I was totally disappointed with how the story went. Why did they keep Edward alive? Why did they portray Walter as a nice guy? And why didn't they ship the Somervilles' out to southwest Asia and so goes for Judith? Also, it was Judith who found Gus in London. Why oh why was it Diana Carey-Lewis? Did the broadcasting company run short on budget? Were they in a terrible rush to finish the series like a botched-up plastic surgery horribly gone wrong?Overall I sort of enjoyed it, but it could have been a lot better!!!!!!"
1,Charmless and shallow,"Having enjoyed the book (several times) despite its lack of reality and adherence to a pastoral myth of perfection in everything (come on, how likely is it that all bad things become good and every important person is totally charming and/or perfect looking, while all the horrid ones get their just desserts), I was interested in seeing the screen adaption. Yuck. Charmless, poor and wooden acting, changed story lines and themes all contributed to a total let-down. To me, it seemed to be just a cynical means of extracting more money out of a popular novel (a bit like the merchandising that goes on around all sorts of movies)and to hell with the atmosphere."
2,THE PRODUCER'S OF THIS MOVIE OBVIOUSLY NEVER READ THE BOOK,AS A REAL ROSAMUND PILCHER FAN I WAITED FOR THIS MOVIE..HAVING READ THE BOOK TWICE. BOY WAS I 1)DISAPPOINTED 2)ANGRY. THIS MOVIE BEARS ONLY A FLEETING SIMILARITY TO THE BOOK...STARTING WITH LOVEDAY IN PIGTAILS...TO PHYLLIS AND MR. BAINES AND BIDDY BEING WIPED OUT..JUDITH TELLS EDWARD SHE WON'T MARRY HIM AND WE ALL KNOW THAT NEVER HAPPENED...IN THE BOOK THE HOMES AND THE CHARACTERS YOU REALLY LOVE...IN THE MOVIE THE CHARACTERS ARE SILLY AND YOU DON'T LIKE COMING HOME TO THEM. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
3,Flawed but fun,"The scenery was stunning, the acting quite decent, and the story pure romantic escapism. Still the overall impression was less than impressive. I am not sure whether it is an advantage to have read the book or not. Having read it, I was able to fill in a lot of the details. On the other hand, I was constantly aware of how much was missing. Still, I enjoyed watching it and, although I could have found more worthwhile uses for the purchase price, I am not sorry that I acquired the video."
3,Frightfully disappointing!,"As an advid Rosamund Pilcher fan I was overjoyed to find that Coming Home had been developed into a mini series. However, I was soon disapponted. The cast did a marvelous job of acting and the scenery was breath taking. (Althought the Dower House did seem a bit too grand.) However, the story line was was too adulterated. The screenwriters would have been far better off to develop a longer series and keep many of the characters that we loved in the novel and give more depth to the characters. Judith and Loveday often came across as shallow and we know that this was not the case. To paraphrase a previous reviewer, I wish I would have saved my money."
2,GREAT BOOK IF YOU LIKE TO WAIST TIME,"Maybe its just be, but I prefer a book that doesn't have a bunch of fluff and long stories. A good book to me just has the facts and important details. This book is filled with long winded stores and it takes forever to get to the details and gold."
5,A Great Read. No Wonder the Show Worked...,"This guy's humility and good humor keep you engaged throughout the book. And it's obvious he knows what he's doing and what he's talking about. I've spent some time on sitcom sets and he captures the experience enough to put you there. Phil comes off as the sort of guy you'd be happy to know, hang or work with. The stories range from funny to touching, the book kept me hooked and was hard to put down. Looking forward to his next project."
5,Phil Rosenthal,Phil Rosenthal is one of the nicest guys I have ever met and this is truly conveyed in the book. It demonstrates that you do not have to lie or cheat or be mean or skeptical or sleep your way to the top in Hollywood. Despite being courteous to those around him and sticking by his guns and his wife he managed to not only make a show but also make it last for 9 seasons and succesfully. The book reveals where the everyone Loves Raymond story lines came from--his own and the other writers' family experiences--Phil said that everyone working on the show was forced to go home in time for dinner so they could report back with their family arguments the next day in the writer's room!
5,Funny Business,"This is a funny book... so you're already lucky if you buy it. You will get to laugh. Many times. Out loud.But it's not just a funny book about show business. It's a book about how to find the funny in life even when life is doing it's best to wipe the smile off your face.If you've got family - parents, spouse, kids, what have you - you'll find the funny here. If you've ever taken an dreadful vacation - you'll find the funny here. If you've ever had to pull a well placed knife out of your back, you'll find the funny here. If you've ever said ""My life could be a sitcom"" - well you'll find out why that's best left to the professionals, and why the sitcom behind the sitcom is very funny business."
2,don't judge this book by its cover,"You have to go out of your way to find any humor here. After the first 50 pages, most readers will conclude ""been there, done that."" There's a level of detail about ""the guys in the room,"" stories of successes and failures along the way, the standard smattering of back-stabbing and swipes at the network guys, etc. that even die hard fans of the show will find tough going. The fact that there is very little insight here into the cast and even less about Ray Romano (if it's possible to write any book about this how without him this one is it) doesn't help. Rosenthal comes across as an undoubtedly nice guy who is indeed lucky but seems to devote most of these pages to reminding himself that he is all of those things plus how much he loves everyone on the show and all the neat people he's gotten to meet along the way--everything but funny."
3,"you're lucky , you're funny","I thought the book was pretty good. I am 78 years old and can never remember what I have read, just if I liked it or not and I did like it."
3,Not much to see...,"I'm afraid there's not much to see in this book,despite the interesting cover. I enjoy feministic literature, which this is. It should be understood that the title means what it saysf these ladies portrayed are generally pretty wacko or at least weird. For that, author must b givn cred. I think I mayb expected some uplift or redemption--not a chance! I think if u are a horror fan, rather than fantasy, you will enjoy this book."
2,Simplistic,"The book has a very interesting title but the stories just don't live up to it. They wind around and around without going anywhere, they messages at the end of each story are just not interesting."
5,Awesome album!!!,"This has instantly become my favorite Christmas album ever. It's one of those rare CDs that you love instantly from beginning to end; every song is truly a pleasure to hear. The whole album is beautiful, relaxing, and nostalgic (some songs really remind me of the Charlie Brown Christmas album). But it's even something that you'll listen to all year round since it's as much bossa nova as it is Christmas. Enjoy it in March and July and October and..."
2,Is bossa nova really this monochromatic?,There's no variety on this CD--every song sounds pretty much like every other song on it. It's audio wallpaper--practically elevator wallpaper. Learn from my mistake: don't buy a CD that's listed with no sample tracks and no independent reviews.
5,Christmas Music At Its Best !!,"I agree with all the positive reviews above. Bottom line is: if you love bossa nova music like I do, you have GOT to get this CD. Great arrangements, great jazzy guitar solos, and authentic bossa nova rhythm. Great ""Christmas Lounge"" music. Bossalover, Lompoc, CA"
3,buy it for the pictures only,"I am a huge Lautner fan and have all the other books. I am also a huge fan of this Taschen architects series. Amazing value for price.... HOWEVER, this little book is really poorly written. It's filled with archi-geek-speak and architecture school jargon. I bet the author is a professor somewhere or a recent graduate with an MARCH I. Ignore the text and enjoy Lautner's terrific work. The book costs less than 2 starbucks coffees so enjoy."
4,a solid album,"i enjoy most of this cd. tracks that really stand out: you're so hollywood, coke, beautiful."
4,You need to hear this band.,"I'm going to stick to comparing this to what I heard before the release of the album:I don't like what they did with Coke and Hollywood, and I preferred Beautiful and SWT joined together like they were before, but other than that they've done some interesting toying around with and lengthening some of these songs. They sound great. Buy this. Now."
2,Best unsigned band ever?,"This album has some decent tracks, although the lyrics seem to think they are more profound than they actually are. All in all it's a good rock album, but it's nothing you haven't heard before. I'm sure that in every city in america there is a band who plays this type of music and writes songs at the same level. These bands however, have not been on a reality-based TV show and thus will never be signed. Buy this record if Flickerstick was your favorite band on the TV show. Don't buy this album if you think are you stumbling onto some great new innovative band."
2,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM!,"DONT buy it. If you've heard some Mp3s of them, and you like them DONT buy this CD, its COMPLETLEY remixed and sounds AWFUL. And in 'coke' instead of saying 'naked with my gril' they say 'taken with my girl'. Buy the original album NOT the one epic released. Otherwise flickerstick rules."
2,Really disappointing,"I first Flickerstick last November during one of their show for ""Bands on the Run."" It was INCREDIBLE! Every band member played with such intensity, and I loved it. However, the CD is a whole other issue.Songs like ""Lift"" and ""Beautiful"" were great live. But listen to the CD: The 1st thing you here is Brandin whining the cliched lyrics to ""Lift (With Love We Will Survive)."" A lot of the rest of the CD is Goo Goo Dolls-type stuff played so restrained and watered-down that I don't know why people like it.I will give props to the fact that the production, however professionally annoying it is, does sound like a mainstream pop record, instead of a grainy indie sound. So take my advice: Please go see Flickerstick live, but do NOT buy their CD."
4,Without a doubt...worth a listen!,"I have to agree with others who have said how good this CD is from beginning to end. I have owned the disc since July and have played it constantly. Their style is unlike any other band around right now, and their lyrics are thoughtful and sometimes, thought-provoking. Listen to ""Direct Line to the Telepathic"" and ""Chloroform the One You Love."" If you missed them on VH1's Bands on the Run, try to catch them live. I understand their live show is a treat not to be missed. People have compared Flickerstick's sound to that of Pink Floyd and U2, two bands anyone would want to be associated with. Do yourself a favor and check out ""Welcoming Home the Astronauts."""
5,Great up and coming band!,"I first saw the infamous Flickerstick in April 2000 on the campus of Baylor University, for a student radio station benefit show. They blew everyone away. They truly are an excellent band that writes some great songs, like 'Coke' 'Beautiful' and 'Got a Feeling'. They know how to rock too, as evident on 'Talk Show Host' and 'Hollywood'. They put on a great show and are what I think the music scene needs right now--an raucous, extroverted, party-animal rock and roll band."
5,the best unknown band,"I think that flickersticks ""welcoming home the astronauts"" is one of the best cds out right now. not only do they have an awesome stage presence, but brandons voice is just plain out great. all of their songs have great hooks that make you want to keep listening to them the whole day. the only thing im dissapointed in is that smile is not on the cd. that was one of my favorite songs. i cant wait to see more of them. they have great material and are going to be huge one day!!!"
4,Look for the indie release,"The Epic release is a great album but the indie release is less touched up and a lot more raw. There are exceptions. I like ""Got a feeling"" on the major label better but I like ""Beautiful"" on the indie. I think they did good in dropping ""Right way to fly"".I liked it so much I bought both versions. I definately recommend this record."
1,not really good at all!,"This band was brought to my attention by Bands on th Run and I decided to check them out! I hear nothing special! I only hear some sort of cheap, unimaginative spin on Goo Goo Dolls and Pink Floyd! This is the same old yuck that has been coming out for years! The lyrics suck, the music is plain and boring, and the lead singer whines and tries to make it sound like some poetic important thing! When I listen close, it sounds like the lyrics were written by little boys trying hard to sound like educated men! They must have spent ages trying to think up lryics that would make little girls sigh! How pathetic! Anyway, my advice is don't buy this album! You don't have to follow the crowd, there is much greater music out there and done by much more talented musicians! This was a money loss in my opinion!"
1,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING,"Be careful - you will not receive floor mats for the back seat! Even though the photos show a back seat mat, and even though the written description talks about trimming the rear mat to fit - NO BACK SEAT/REAR MATS WERE INCLUDED WITH MY ORDER!"
5,god moves in a peculiar way.........i am god......,"Offenbach is great anyhow, but this recording is riotous. The translation into English is first-rate, really funny stuff, and the singing is pretty good, too. Very worthwhile."
5,Great Live Jazz; Horrible Packaging,"This four-disc box set captures some exquisite live jazz performances featuring the still spry Oscar Peterson, stalwart bassist Ray Brown, guitarist Herb Ellis and drummer Bobby Durham. The music is taken from gigs recorded live at the Blue Note March 16-18, in 1990.All the musicians sound great and the recorded sound is excellent. The only criticism I have of this set has to do with the packaging. Some genius at Telarc decided to lock the CD's in their holders using some new design that makes it insanely difficult to remove the discs. It took me fifteen minutes at least and it was miraculous I didn't break them in the process. The new design is like a medieval torture device. Don't let it stop you from buying the set, but be aware of it and use caution in getting the discs out. No one who spends $35 on a box set should have to go through this."
5,Oscar Peterson Trio Live at the Blue Note,"If you have no Oscar Peterson music in your audio library, this CD set is the one to have; his playing is superb! The sound quality is the same, and with 4 CDs, you don't get tired of listening to the versatility of the music. I cannot say enough about this set. I think you will enjoy it; it makes a great gift for friends also. Too bad OP is not with us any longer."
1,Does nothing on my Husky's coat.,"This product did nothing to remove any loose fur on my Husky's undercoat. I am just going to stick with the furminator. People seem to think the Furminator is bad for dogs, however mine is fine with it. It removes a ton of LOOSE fur, without excessive brushing that could hurt my dogs skin."
5,Great product!,This brush is great! It went through my 3 dogs' fur without pulling and removed so much hair! I highly recommend it to anyone with a dog who sheds! It gets the undercoat with no problem and the sound is very slight and didn't bother my dogs at all!
2,Didn't work for me,Bought this for a PomChi. Did not work at all. I know it was too big but I really cant see how it would work on anything less than a Buffalo. I really don't think it was designed to remove the under coat just a brush to remove tangles.
3,pulls out most of shedding hair,this brush is only ok I use it 2x a day on mt cavilere king charles and i still end up daily with a vacuume full of dog hair.
5,use with Evolution Self-Cleaning Slicker,"i use this with the Evolution Self-Cleaning Slicker Medium-Large Brush for Dogs on my white shepherd, works great together."
5,Not for your Kitty.,This is a very high-quality device and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I think the description should be better. I wish I had this when I needed to comb out my horse's mane!Do not think you can use this on a kitty ...
2,Average Job,"I got caught up in all the great reviews on this one. I bought one and tried it on my dog, but I have to admit, it was just average. A week prior, my friend had loaned me her Furminator to try. It worked really good. Based on the reviews for this one being as good as her brand, I thought I'd save some $$$ and order one. I should've just bitten the bullet and bought her brand. Sorry, just didn't work that good."
2,too wide for short hair,The teeth are too wide for my short hair Rottweiller. Does not do the job. But probably good for the long hair dog.
2,did not like this,"did not like this grooming rake. it was weird and awkward for me to use. didnt really work with my German wire hair, maybe better for other breeds"
4,not bad,I have a long haired border collie/shepherd mix. The brush works quite well on getting the hair off and he loves it. The only downside is that it doesn't catch all the hair and some if it stay on my dog or blows around into my face. Overall it works extremely well.
5,No pulling,"Bought last week from amazon and got it this week. Since I just had my American Eskimo groomed last Sun, she doesn't ave much dead undercoat as before, I was still able to pull out a small amount of hair by lightly brushing on her coat. It ias advertised, does NOT pull her hair. She hates the furminator especially on her fur pants (hind legs) where she has the most shedding of hair, but with this one, she hardly notice I was doign anything and do not move so much.Also the price at amazon is very very nice. I have seen in pet stores, similar product, not with rotating pins, single row rake for $23!! So this is a good buy, worth the price and get the hair out. I am hoping to enjoy all my black clothes with less of the white doggie hair on them from now on."
5,Excellent product for a heavily coated Sheltie,"My poor Sheltie has been so abused when I tried to comb or brush him.After getting this product, I was actually able to line-brush him for the first time. No screams or groans or attempts to run away.I still don't quite grasp how it works but those rotating pins do not pull the hair like a regular rake or comb.I highly recommend this product to anyone with a double-coated dog."
5,Excellent product,"I really hesitated to order this because of the expense, but it seems to work very well. It is quite a weighty substantial tool and works great on our little Japanese Chin which sheds everywhere. Now I can confidently carry him around without getting hairs all over my clothes. Thank you."
5,Takes some time but works.,You have to use it every other day for the first week but after that once a week and it keeps the hair down drastically on my german shepherd/ Chow mix.
4,Evolution W6110 Grooming Undercoat Rake / Rotating Teeth Double Row,I just received Evolution Grooming Rake today . I tried the rack on my Siberian Husky Puppy and it worked beautifully. Picked up the undercoat hair very nicely. Loved the rotating teeth idea. didn't hurt the puppy's at all. He really loved it. This rake is really pretty sturdy too. I would have gave this item a 5 star rating except I thought it should be a little bigger in size. When my Husky gets full size a larger rake would cover more area. Plus I wish the handle was a little bit longer too. But all in all this really nice item to groom your dog. I also have a grown Cockapoo and I'm pretty sure this rake will help with his mated hair too.
2,"I've bought this brand before, but this pack was just awful","I've bought this brand many times and been happy with them, but this last package was awful. Not sure what changed. The elastics just don't have the right stretch to them. They just seem way too tight. I couldn't get it around a ponytail the right amount of times. Either it was too loose and the ponytail holder just fell out, or i had to force it around one more time which resulted in a snapped ponytail holder. I think next time i will buy from a local store so i can feel the elasticity before purchasing."
5,recommand!,It is just a simple black head band. It last really long and doesn't get stretch out over a long time of period.
2,Too tight,"The rubber bands are cheap looking. You can see the two ends unevenly connected by glue. Also they are extremely tight, they give me a headache."
5,"""Soldiers, Sailors, Slaves and Ships"" Highly Recommended!",A wonderful book - full of remarkable photographs accompanined by vivid and intriguing text. Moore's camera captures the complexities of the Civil War admirably and also explores aspects of the war frequently overlooked by other sources. A surprisingly enjoyable read.
3,"Portable, handy, but imperfect","I have long been looking for a volume of Shakespeare's works that was portable enough to hold without getting a serious biceps workout, and I happened to find this one in a used bookstore. It's marvelous in that the pages are thick enough to highlight and not worry about the bleeding [although I'm using ""nonbleeding"" highlighters {also wonderful; they're called friXion highlighters by Pilot. Highly suggest them, though they don't always erase, which is really no surprise.}]However, that handiness comes at a price: there are some spelling errors, and I wouldn't be surprised if there are more errors than that in here. By no means should you use this volume for scholarship of any kind.All in all, though, it's a very handy and accessible, very readable volume (in verse, at least; some of the prose passages look a bit cramped) that, as I said, won't make your arms give out from the heft of it.5 stars for size, page thickness, and readability1 star for poor editing"
5,Truth!,"This book should be back in print! Having worked in higher education for over 17 years, I can attest with confidence that herein lies the truth, or at least a good summary of it. This work forms a foundation for a begining of the work of reform. If you are a thinking American, read this book. If you are interested in the future of our civilization read it! This work is well worth your time.Enjoy, and reap the fruits of inquiry."
5,"funny ,good and awesome","This book is the best time warp trio book I ever read. It starts with Fred, Sam, and Joe watching a wild west movie. Fred says he wants to go into the movie, and THE BOOK (a magical book that can teleport you throughout time) teleports them there. Now they have to find THE BOOK to get home. My favorite parts of this book are when there is a stampede, or the flood, or when Joe, Sam, and Fred meet an indian tribe. My favorite character in this book is Joe because he passes out too much. I don't like it when some Indian comes out of nowhere and takes Joe to his village for no reason. It was hard to believe. But later you find out why. My least favorite character is Fred because most of the time it's his fault that they get in trouble. He is also the funniest. I think this book is excellent and everyone should buy it!!!!!!!!"
3,Consistent and spirited songs.,"The Outfield is a good band. I've had Playing the Field in my collection for several years. It contains a nice group of straight-ahead pop rock songs. I enjoy listening to it from time to time. All ten of the tracks on Playing the Field are melodic, tight, and listenable. Tony Lewis is a pretty cool singer, and his voice is very recognizable and unique. The Outfield's musicianship and songwriting skills are solid. Some of the tracks that I like are ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""Voices of Babylon."" ""Since You've Been Gone"" has a very catchy chorus, and ""Voices of Babylon"" is very atmospheric. Keyboards are only used sparingly on some of the songs. It's too bad that this hits package doesn't have a biography of the band in the liner notes--that would have been cool and informative. Playing the Field is good and worth a listen."
5,Great Example of French Baroque,"... Although there are only four (sometimes five) musicians playing, their sound is somehow very full and robust. I already own a number of recordings of Lully's music but most of the selections here were new to me. Excellent!"
5,Munch Nut Bar,"Got the Munch Nut Bar from my granddaughter, loved it and couldn't find it anywhere. So I googled it and found it on Amazon.com. Best candy bar I have eaten, it has a buttery taste, with nuts and corn syrup. I have been ordering them every since I found them on Amazon."
3,BIA popcorn bowl,"It is a neat product idea, only it is too huge. A microwave bag of popcorn barely fills half of the container. If you have a big family, or are sharing with a lot of people, it is fine. But, it is unwieldy for my son to sit on the couch with and handle easily."
5,Very Cute and just the right size!,"This is the perfect popcorn holder for home use. If you pop popcorn in a microwaveNordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup(and use this container for the actual popping, like I do). You weigh out between 3.4 and 3.7 ounces of un-popped popcorn, then pop it, and it fills up this container almost exactly to the amount seen in the picture of the popcorn bowl.I love the way it has the drawing on the front saying ""Fresh Pop Corn."" It looks almost like exactly like what the popcorn containers in movie theaters used to say. And then, when you get to the bottom of it, it has a funny little joke.After all the popcorn is gone, the bottom says to you: ""That's All Folks!"" Very cute.The only thing about it that makes me worry is that it's ceramic, so if I drop it at the wrong time, I could break it, otherwise, it's perfect for popcorn."
5,Great Item,This book was a gift to my father-in-law. He said he liked it and he would recommend it to others.
1,Second home,"Do not buy this DVD. This is a very low quality product, both in image and editorial content, which is very limited and ends abruptly, leaving to many information and topics uncovered."
2,Content Great,"This was a a wonderful and informative DVD. However, the quality was terrible it looks like a copy it was grainy and certainly was 2nd rate. It looks like it was copied off of television."
5,RW New Orleans: The Ultimate Fan Guide,"If you watched every episode of Real World New Orleans, this book is for you. If you watched a few episodes of here and there of Real World New Orleans, this book is for you. If you watched one episode of Real World New Orleans, this book is for you. EVERYONE WILL LOVE THIS BOOK! RW NO: Unmasked doesn't retell the 5 months of drama that we saw daily on TV. It gives you the inside story, the behind-the-scenes, the ""in-between"" moments. Everything that wasn't allowed to be shown on TV - in Unmasked. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fresh, real look on reality tv. This is one you can't miss!"
5,Crazy Madness,Man when you pick up this book you can almost feel all the anger pent up inside. When I began to read I realized none of these N'awlins Seven even liked each other. The book ruins the perfect image everyone has of them getting along and everything. The video is a lot better thatn the book.
5,A must have for any Real World viewer!,"If you were a fan of The Real World New Orleans, than you need to get this book! Find out about secret hook-ups and conflicts that were never aired on television! Learn what the cast had to say about Melissa's dramatic ways, and who called Melissa a attention-craving camera whore (and it's not David)! Find out the truth about Julie and her fight with her dad! Read the cast's audition applications! Also, catch up with the outrageous Hawaii cast, and find out what they have to say one year after their season aired! This is a must have for anyone who watched Real World New Orleans! You will not regret it!"
4,"Stirring, Memorable but Acoustically Lacking","I echo all the favorable comments made by other reviewers. Ralph Stanley singing these songs, born of the soil, sounds like what an Old Testament prophet might sound like. I loved in particular ""Little Moses.""What left me perplexed was the sound quality. I'm wondering if T. Bone Burnett wanted a mono-like sound reminiscent of the thirties and forties a la the era of the Carter Family. The soundstage is compressed and sounds like all the instruments are massed in the center. There's little imaging, air or separation between guitars, autoharp, banjo, etc. and Ralph, of course, is dead center. In addition, there's a haze or veil over the recording. Again, I'm wondering if this was intended to mimic those bygone days."
4,Useful guide,"Although I have yet to put the advice in this book to the test - my son graduates from high school next week - it has given me many things to think about as we prepare for his departure to college in just a couple of months. I'm sure much of it I would have figured out on my own, but reading this book has given me some ideas (where and how to bank, where should he register to vote, make hotel reservations early for parents weekend) that it's better to think of early than late. I expect as we get into packing and shopping mode, I will be referring to it more and more."
5,tips and tunes,Loved finding some new tunes and variations on some old ones..Beautifully put together and easy to read for a good session sharing with friends.
5,Best Post-1970 Beatle Release,"This is absolutely the best post-breakup release from the Beatles. Nothing else even comes close, with the possible exception of ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"". A CD/DVD release of ""The Beatles at Shea Stadium"" would be very cool, especially if EMI could get clearances to release all of the music from the show including the opening acts (King Curtis, the soundtrack to the dancers, et al.). It has only been 45 years; patience is a virtue."
5,ANY FAN OF THE BEATLES,"WOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. LIVE STUDIO RECORDINGS MADE FOR BBC RADIO IN THE EARLY 60'S, THIS IS THE BEATLES AT THE HEIGHT OF BEATLEMANIA, THEIR PRE-PSYCHEDELIC SGT. PEPPER DAYS. THIS IS THE KIND OF MUSIC THAT MADE THE BEATLES WHO THEY WERE. GREAT ROCK AND ROLL, BEATLES HITS AS WELL AS COVERS OF THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IDOLS AND INFLUENCES. THE INTIMACY AND IMMEDIACY OF THESE RECORDINGS MAKE THEM GREAT. YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD."
4,Beatles @ BBC,"This contains live recordings very well done. There is some, small amounts, of new material. The sound is the Beatles and is very well worth the price. I'd buy it again or send it as a gift.Ray AndersonLittleton, CO."
5,Live at the BBC,"This is a must for Beatles fans. 2 cd's full of fun entertainment. Takes you way back, and is a delight to listen to. I was happy to add this to my Beatles collection. Being a fan from the beginning, I enjoy both the old and the new. If you like the Beatles, it's a must buy."
5,Live At The BBC,"This CD will give the listener a view into The Beatles prior to 1964. Many of the songs are from their playlist going back to their Hamburg days. Most of the selections are just the four Beatles, no double tracking, no studio magic, just their normal gig performances, done for the BBC radio microphones. One striking feature to me is the excellence of George Harrison's lead guitar. He is and was one of the very best. His lead work goes beyond what was typical and expected of that day and is a precursor of what rock guitar would become. He is a master of the Rock-a-billy style, yet with a definite Liverpool sound. Their wit, humour, and incredible charisma also is very evident in the chat with the various MCs prior to playing. The CD also gives fascinating insight into the popular music of the early 60s, just prior to the British invasion. Live At The BBC is a must have not only for the Beatles fan, but anyone interested in music history of the 20th Century."
2,"Alright, but Great if you like Live Albums","If you're a fan of anything live the Beatles have done, then this album is just right for you. There are funny snipits of interviews and conversations they've had with the BBC that will make you laugh. There are also a couple of songs previously unheard like John's cover of ""Memphis, TN"" and Paul's version of ""Til There Was You"" is actually better than the recorded album version on this take.But if I have this CD on my ipod I find myself skipping the majority of the songs because they just aren't as good as their best work. So this album is just okay for me.The insert is great. Lots of pictures, some previously not ever seen. Many taken at the BBC studios.If you're a die-hard Beatles fanatic, then definitely buy. If you're just starting out, buy their other albums first before this one. Get to know their music first. This is definitely not for the faint of heart :)"
5,Classic Beatles From a More Innocent Time,"I can remember back to when you had to track down bootlegs of this exact material, and those CDs didn't have the announcer guy, whose spoken byplay with the Beatles adds a lot of reality and charm. Also, the booklet is rich in notes, details, data, etc. A great new--well, relatively new--way to get more Beatles than the albums they actually produced together in the studio. Very enjoyable stuff."
3,a bit of a disappointment,".... Unpolished, kind of like a good garage band. The guys in the studio hadn't put the make up on the sound. That's not to say it isn't good for other reasons. From an historical perspective it is a must have for a serious Beatles collector.....Well, the Beatles really did grow up and did some fantastic music. But these early recordings are a bit of a disappointment to me."
2,The two old guys are back,"Sarà l'età, sarà che i tempi di ""Free Jazz / Black Power"" sono passati da un pezzo, sarà il mal di schiena che avanza. Fatto sta che Archie Shepp e Rosewell Rudd si sono proprio rammolliti. Quando mio figlio ha portato a casa il cd che riunisce, dopo più di trent'anni, i due vecchi alfieri della New Thing non volevo proprio credere alle mie orecchie. Erano proprio loro? Meglio non pensarci, rispolverare un loro vecchio disco in vinile (Freedom del 1967), commuovermi un poco e gettare quest'ultima triste incisione nel cestino dell'immondizia.Il padre di Arthur Cravan"
3,Informative but missing key information,"The valuable part of this book is the step-by-step instruction in carving and finishing. It is detailed and easy to follow. The discussion of tools is also good, going into specifics that are hard to find elsewhere. Liebson also writes reasonably well and organizes his book cleanly.The big drawback to this book is that it ignores the techniques that Liebson himself doesn't use: not only does it leave out indirect carving (copying from a model), but also omitted is any discussion of how to carve details with a chisel. The sculptures photographed for the book, including half a dozen of Liebson's own, tend to be abstract and employ only large, simple forms. They all eschew the kind of fine details that are essential to most of the world's stone-carving traditions, such as the floral decadence of a Corinthian capital or the lettering on a tombstone. Liebson's choice not to cover this--or even to mention it--is a discouraging flaw in an otherwise decent book."
5,A Beginner's dream!,"As an utter beginner, 10-15 years ago, I purchased this book. It told me where to get rocks, tools, workbench - all of which I was able to mail-order (since he also gives addresses). I did so, and started carving on a piece of lovely pink alabaster, with only this book as a guide. I couldn't find ANY local instruction. And I did pretty well, using just this book. Go for it!"
5,A great resource for the newbie sculptor,"I got this book from the library after getting the bug at a two hour ""intro to stone carving."" When I went to buy my tools, the store had the book prominently featured. The proprietor told me to just do what the author says. I am following his instructions to the word. It's a very thorough and encouraging book, and is well laid out. He illustrates his points with his own pieces. He points out errors to avoid, and how to avoid blunders."
5,Arabic Mystical Modernism,"Afifi Matar, is one of the most important living Arab poets. In this Diwan (collection of poems) and other (such as Anta Wahidhuha), he evokes an immense sensibility to the imagery and allegories of the contemorary Arab condition. He is an Egyptian by birth, but it is evident from ""Quartet of Joy"" and his other poems, that he is able to transcend his Egyptianess to the larger Arab condition.He is on the vant-garde of a select group of Arab poets who were able to break free of the strict rules of traditional Arabic poetry.Matar, is a poet that, even in translation, has a universal appeal. He is a ""modern"" metaphysical Arab poet."
3,Decent Remake,"Generally, remakes are never as good as the original and this one is no exception. This new version seems to have more gratuitous nudity and violence than the original (and that is not an easy thing to do) yet it is worth seeing if you are a fan of the original. If you find the subject matter revolting, then just stay away. This movie is not for you."
3,Movie was very good.,"I like this movie, it is undeniably one of the best films made. It is a cult classic that got reworked but the streaming of this movie was terrible. It would stop right in the middle of the movie and cut off. I would have to hit the play button again to start the movie over and it did not even restart where it left off. I had to fast forward the movie to the part where it left off."
5,Soon to be another cult hit,I haven't seen the original. For a film like this i put it in a category i call revenge flicks which this pretty much sums up the movie in the fewest words. The beginning is a little slow for the set up of the film but once it starts to go it only takes one break from there before it gets back to nonstop revenge. The back story is simple almost to a fault but cant really complain to much for that. The first half of the movie is definitely not for the weak of heart. I've seen it before on DVD and the Blu-ray version is actually worth the upgraded format(some movies just dont have a good enough quality upgrade to justify the Blu-ray verson)
4,Graphic but good,"Descent remake of a classic 70's film. This one was a bit more graphic than the original, but it you can handle it....it was good!"
5,Must see!,"This movie gets 5 stars across the board for me. You wont be dissapointed but hey ,check out for yourself and thank me later!"
2,The revenge can be sick ...,"What a bad movie, I don't understand how someone can like this. But it has the message for those who don't respect women."
2,They spit on intelligence.,"Production values and acting are much better than the original but almost every scene is even less plausible than the 1978 version. If you are a big slasher/gore/revenge fan you will probably like the 2010 version more. If you have a few hours and are willing to put up with 70's exploitation production values and acting you will get more out of the original by watching it, then re-watching with Joe Bob Briggs' commentary turned on. As for reviews of the 2010 version that say it is ""smart"" and ""female empowering"", I find that to be dumbfounding if they are comparing the movie to the real world. By slasher film standards it may be ""smart"" though."
3,Is this a remake or a porno version of Saw???,"I remember the original I Spit on Your Grave from 1978!! It was BRUTAL, DISTURBING and SADISTIC!! Now, this remake is also very disturbing but it borrows A LOT from Saw. :(The rape scene in this movie is not SOOO graphic as the original 70's version but the revenge scenes are WAY MORE BRUTAL! Also, the acting is actually good (unlike the original) and the production is much better in this new version.I still preffer the original 70's version because it was a DISTURBING SADISTIC SEXUAL MASTERPIECE that was very shocking at the time. This one is also shocking but the revenge scenes are very alike to the Saw movies. If you liked the traps in the Saw movies then you might enjoy this movie because is pretty much the same thing but with a sexual touch.Adios."
2,"Bad remake, boring, slow, no gore scenes. NC-17 movie","its a good movie but can NEVER be compared to the original that was banned in the US for extreme rape scenes. This one is calm, not much gore, pretty slow, nothing extreme, i would say this one is a NC-17. Nowadays there are tons of horror/slasher movies with lot more gore and disgusting scenes and the women is physically tortured than this remake! Pretty boring actually.. She falls in the river and shows up a month later with not a single scar.. It doesn't even show how this city girl survived in the woods for a month!!?! She just shows up with new clothes and make-up.. now that is weird.."
1,Revolting,"This movie was as vile to me as either ""Hostel,"" ""Hostel 2,"" or ""High Tension."" A remake of an 80s cult favorite, this movie decided to be as repugnant as it could be--and succeeded. You've heard the story, so I won't bore you with it again. All I can say is that if you were disturbed by the rape scene in the remake of ""Last House on the Left,"" honey, you ain't seen nothing compared to this one, because it goes on and on and on and on. And just when you think it's over, it starts again.This movie belongs in a trash heap."
1,This just sucked,"This has to be the worst acted, worst written movie ever, even the 1978 original version was better than this!! Hollywood you suck at movies!"
1,WTF,"I just had to stop by and give my two cents on this video, having seen some of the original. Crap like this should be banned...I mean there are simply some things you should NOT make movies about. Rape is one of them. Seriously, half the movie is just one big rape scene...and the rest is murder and sex. It was a sick movie back then and is a sick movie now. If you fantasize about rape and can sit through graphic rape scenes without feeling an ounce of disgust and feel depressed afterwards, this is the movie for you."
1,Sigh,Typical teen movie. The only real excitement was the little nudity. But even then you can save some time and go watch something else like short bus.
3,"Seriously Disturbing, but solid thriller","First off, I'm not going to comment on whether this movie should or shouldn't have been made, or whether it was inappropriate, blah blah blah. If you want to go that route, then you better have the same opinion of Deliverance. If you don't like the idea of it, DO NOT WATCH IT! It was soooo disturbingly graphic in the rape scene that I almost threw up. Unfortunately, it is hard to shock people these days, but this will definitely shock the average person. All controversies aside, this movie was a B grade horror movie with a taste of Deliverance mixed into the Saw movies. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and the revenge is almost as foul as the actions that set off the main character. Do I think this is realistic, no. This is a typical B to C grade thriller with a lot of controversy surrounding it."
2,Really That Great?,"This is a remake of the old 1980's rape genre films for sick people. The plots are basically the same. A woman is raped. Woman gets revenge. Sometimes it is an abduction or a home invasion, or in this case, a woman is taken in her cabin by a bunch of rednecks. As compared to the original, the nudity was less in the remake and the rape scene less graphic. There I said it. Oh yes, the characters are more developed and the torture inflicted by the woman is a tad better, but is that why people watch rape films, for character? The same could be said for the remake of ""Last House on the Left,"" they watered down the rape and nudity. I can't believe with all these silicon soft core stars, they could not have picked something with more eye candy for the starring role instead of someone who can act.Decent folks will want to stay away from this movie. Sickos would be better off with the original or a David Hess film festival. Anyone up for ""A Dirty Western"" remake?"
4,oh man...,"This is a very disturbing movie. The assault is horrible and the revenge is intense. I actually felt my jaw drop a few times without realizing it. If you dont mind some extreme nasty and a little trauma to your mind, I highly recommend this movie."
4,good,"good show for adults, arrived quickly and at a great price . have told my friends and another one ordered it"
3,Meh,"I still prefer the original of the same title, but this one was good as well. I defiantly liked the revenge sequence, but the build up, I found lacking."
5,loved it,this movie was not all that scary and it was a good movie if u are into rape movies and freaky ways to die and i would sugest anyone under 16 to watch this movie.
3,Disappointing,"Save your money a pale comparison to the original. Lighting is poor throughout, acting almost as bad, none of the suspense or karmic retribution that you would expect. As with most remakes leaves a lot to be desired, buy the original if you have yet to see it, much better investment."
5,Freaking Brutal - Totally Awesome,"This is what the new breed and standard of horror should be like. ISoYG was executed brilliantly through out and kept its respect for the first film but took it to the lengths of what hardcore horror fans want.The acting was good, the pacing was great, very difficult to watch in places and the gore was brutal and realistic.Just like the original it will have its controversy, but for horror fans it is a must see."
2,i spit on your grave,"dont like these movies at all ,rather read about it in news lifes to short to dwell on bad things like this."
3,Rape and revenge,"You know what you're getting, a long rape sceen followed by brutal revenge. If you can handle it and call that entertainment it's worth watching."
2,A Vile And Ugly Film,"I wasn't a fan of 1978's I Spit On Your Grave, but I also wasn't a fan of 1972's Last House On The Left. However, I gave the remake of LHOTL a chance, and I liked it. Sure, it had a disturbing rape scene (what rape scene isn't disturbing?), but the payoff was very entertaining. Seeing the rapists get killed in crazy ways by the rapee's parents was sweet indeed. I'm not going to be as kind to the I Spit On Your Grave remake though. It's vile and ugly, and it's not just the rape that is disturbing. Even the murders of the rapists is gross and hard to watch. I could have lived my whole life without seeing a man's severed penis stuffed into his mouth. But seeing that this film has a 6.4 on imdb.com, I guess I'm in the minority."
1,waste of time,"bad writing, bad production, no reason to watch at all. an embarrassing movie. the content is neither shocking nor offensive because it is just too poorly done. an example of the continuity: during the same scene spanning a few minutes of depicted time, outdoor light changes from pitch black to sunny. dialog seems unintentionally cliched."
4,Not terrible,"It's fun. I like this wave, although this is a remake, of girl killers that seems to be starting.Neighbor (Unrated Director's Cut)That movie has more gore but ISoYG had much more money."
5,America's critic,"Now ima guy and this movie is very strong parental advisory, that said for the adults!!!, i loved the story payback is a killer, For $10 go ahead and add it to ur collection-- plain and simple- and im so sick of people writing essay papers on movies if your looking at a movie read the back cover of it........, the acting was insainly good, story was good, chad lindberg is just blowing up ive seen about 5 movies with him lately,,, i spit on your grave delivers!"
5,Best remake!!!,Seen the original and was shocked and awe. But the remake has a twist that was not expected to be seen.
3,My review 2,"The movie was disturbing in the violence toward humans. The contradictory nature of some of the characters is interesting. The movie as a sexploitation vibe to it. Overall, not a bad watch for adults."
4,Better & Worse,"I purchased the original after being told about it by a friend who was into these sorts of movies. I likened it to the Deathwish series. The original was brutal in its own right and maybe a little too graphic in the rape scenes. The remake toned that part down slightly. But the rest of it was pretty good. I don't believe for a second that a city girl can last a month alone in the southern forest, but hey it's a movie, take it with a grain of salt. The revenge scenes were much more clever and believable than the original. All in all much better concept, better execution. It did drag on a little longer than it could have."
3,Very Graphic revenge movie,"I only rented this because a friend of mine was describing this movie that he saw in the 70's so i decided to watch the new version. I'll be quick and simple with this, I love revenge movies so when I heard it was about a woman getting back at guys for violating her I thought as long as the rape scene isn't to difficult to watch this should be good. Well the rape scene is horrifying but once you get past that its always great to see the revenge factor and the way she gets revenge is awesome!"
3,A little better than the original.,"To be completely honest I dont like the original. The only reason I checked this out is because my wife likes the original and wanted to see this one. I thought it was a improvement over the original but I think with this kind of story line they could have taken it to a much darker place. Thats just how I fell, my wife on the other hand enjoyed the movie, but she did agree with me, that it was better than the original."
5,Gave me goosebumps!!!,"At first I was skyptical that thismoviewould really be a horror flick. Itseemedto have the typicaql girl, girl actsstupid,andgirl getkilled scenerio going on but then the plot twists turned and I covered my eyes on some parts while my boyfriend held hisjunk. GREAT movie."
4,Very Good,"The only reason I gave it four stars is, because I thought there was more action in the first movie. Charlie H."
4,good revenge,the girl in this story did a stupid thing by going to a remote location by herselfbut still did not deserve the treatment she got especially from a sheriff! Heracts of vengeance were satisfying and well executed and called for.
2,Crappy film,"This film was a big let down 4 me, If u are thinking about buying it save ur money and buy the original film which blows the other 1 out of the water period."
5,I Spit on Your Grave Review,The dvd came in without any problems and played on my set. Definitely I will purchase products from this seller again.
1,I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE,"The first movie was better. The acting in this movie is atrocious. It seemed like the actors were reading their lines from Q cards. The violence in the rape scene was laughable. You don't feel sad for the woman. Most of the time remakes are never as good as the original. That is the case with this one. The original was made over twenty years ago is way better. This might be worth a watch just to see for your self, but it is not worth buying."
4,Whitney meets clubland again,"Thunderpuss 2000 takes Whitney's bland ""My Love Is Your Love"" and turns it into a club-stomper the same way they did with her ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"". Lots of strong diva vocals take away the ridiculousness of the lyrics, and bring you into a frenzy of body movements. The sample of Raze's ""Break For Love"" is wonderful. It's too bad that the other mixes are not as powerful. The Jonathan Peters remixes are ok, but nothing stupendous. The Wyclef mix is good if you are a fan of R&B/Pop and the Salaam remix is an interesting mix which deserves some listening. The new remix of ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"" is alright as well, a little bit slow, but not bad. The Thunderpuss remixes are what make this disc worthwhile. Let's hope that those Thunderpuss boys take on a Deborah Cox track soon!"
1,"Really wanted to like, but it broke","I really wanted to like this brush. It did a wonderful job on my hair the first few times I used it. Unfortunately, it broke after only 2 weeks of use. A pretty large section of the brush broke off while I was doing my hair. Considering the price of the product, I was very upset. Based on my experience, I can't say that I would recommend this brush."
5,Monster Brush,This is my second Monster Brush and I love it. It was mailed promptly and arrived in mint condition with a small amount of hair product to try (I loved that too).
4,Good ideas but....,"Book has good information and incorrect information. Good in that it gives ideas on how to dress conservatively so that you will not reveal your body to others. It does try to face the fact that modesty is an ever changing subject. However, my problem with this book was the tests to see if you are revealing too much. It shares about standing in front of a mirror in many ways to see if you can see ""cracks"" or underwear. While this is an attempt to be more pure it would still be possible to wear short shorts and tighter clothes and accomplish this. I am not saying it is easy to describe how to stay modest nor do i think women should wear long dresses all of the time. I just think more scripture should have been covered with the examples so that we see what God expects of our heart and actions as well examples like this book has. Making sure that the examples in this book are fool proof so that a girl can justify tight clothes without regret."
5,It hits the mark!,"This book clearly and cleverly addresses the point with young women that modesty in dress and behavior is a choice worth making. With fun art, hip type fonts, and well-written tidbits of valuable information, it captivates the reader and gives her a desire to be more than she has been...to be a better woman.I initially purchased this book for my daughter, and I preread it in one night. It was so good: the information is written in such a memorable way, and it applies to preteens through womanhood. (I'm 39.) I intend on buying copies for the preteen and teen girls in our church, because I wish I had known then what I know now.Do not be at all discouraged with the small size of this book; good things come in small packages!"
5,great,"This short book makes the point of why modesty is important, how its powerful & the author even tells stories about her own life, how she's failed and learned from her mistakes. Its a wonderful little book that encourages teenagers and young women to live for God through modesty. Its so encouraging. If you don't get the big deal about modesty, or want to be encouraged to be modest then this is the book for you. I highly recommend it for all women."
1,Empowering women,"I bought this book as a gift, but when I began flipping through it, I quickly became skeptical. I am in full support of encouraging young women to respect themselves. I desire to see young women today accept themselves and embrace their power. However, teaching young girls that their purpose in life is to find one man to love and care for, is a big step backwards. I also firmly believe there is no excuse for a man stalking or sexually harassing a girl. The suggestion that these things happen because the girl did not pray while getting dressed that day, or the idea that by saying a prayer we can know for certain what God intended in the grey issues in the Bible is outrageous. If you are looking for a book that will encourage intellectual thinking, spiritual growth, independant decisions and confidence in a young woman's life - this is NOT the book."
5,Excellent Book,"This was an excellent book. I would recommend this to every girl, every mother, every woman, to help us to be more attractive and more confident in being the beautiful women God would have us to be."
5,good little book,"small book, important message! you can read this book in like an hour, its only 90 pages long. This book is clear on how exactly to be modest and demand other's respect by respecting yourself. It talks about how modesty is not just what you wear, but how you act. You should definately buy this book."
5,Great product,Great product makes remarkable coffee for pennies a cup. The big coffee chain probabloy hopes not many people discover theser.
4,Pretty Good,"I like the product, but it says it's a three cup coffee press but it's more like a one cup. Overall durable and nice looking."
4,Cookie Cutters,"I love these cookie cutters. The cutters are large enough, they give helpful suggestions and they inspire creativity. It's our annual tradition to make the nativity in cookies!"
1,Nativity Bake Set,I was disappointed that the cookie cutters were just outlines with no interior lines to use for decorating. I was hoping that some artistic detail would be apparent.
3,Interesting Tale; Good Writing,"Yes, another princess and dragon story, quite cliched, but this is actually quite interesting. Although, this book isn't 5 star material, if you know what I mean."
3,A nice juvenile read,"I agree with previous criticisms of the book -- neither characters nor world are well developed. In addition, the typographical errors are annoying.On the positive side, the book has an interesting premise and the author an enjoyable style.This would be a good book for a juvenile who is showing an interest in longer works but may not yet be ready for something the length of a novel."
5,"Well written, a deffinit FIVE STAR QUALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!",This pice of literture is beautifuly written! It has a intracit balence of death and hummer. As the pages turn they bring you one surprise after the next!
4,Great..... but not as good as the older stuff.....,"I love Youngblood and all their music. This is not a BAD album by any means, its just very different, more hip-hop / rap than the previous albums. I prefer more the jazzy YB, but this is great, sweet chillin' music."
2,Not what expected,"Order shipped and arrived quickly. Unfortunately, the watch has a cheap look and feel when seeing it up close. Watch band is not long enough for wrist. Feels like it will break at any moment. Have stopped wearing it and bought another one at Kohls."
3,"Some parts are great, others not.","I bought this for my husband and son for Christmas. My biggest complaint is that the air hockey side is not air hockey at all. It has no air and there are not even slots for the pucks to go in. The table is small, but it is very portable and it flips from game to game with ease."
5,Annie,This book is about this girl name Annie and she is an orphan and she is adopted by this rich man and his mades and his private secretary Miss.Farrell and an Lndian bodyguard Punjab and then she find this dog name Sandy and her friends The Hudson stree orphans.So I relly like this book A lot. Devora Mack
4,Gotta listen to this!,"""Mi Musica"" is definetely good salsa for listening, and dancing. For years Roberto Roena has been furbishing his style, and this record maybe his best. I played it a lot, and still am. Many of my friends bought it after listening (or dancing) to it."
3,OK.,"Nada de otro mundo, como muchos otras ocasiones de salseros viejos y muy bueno en sus tiempo tirando musica que no supera lo que hizo hace muchos anos atras.otro artista tirando musica para ganar unos chavitos...No me impresiono mucho."
1,The true emerald mystery,The only emerald mystery was how the publisher received my green money. I have been reading Marvel since the 60's and this book was an extreme disappointment. It has no action and no compelling villain. I purchased it online. If I had a chance to browse it in a store I would have never purchased it. A sub par product.
3,"Good ideas, a little careless.","I like this author a lot; this book really stands out from the other Spiderman novels in being less action and more perspective based. The book's style, like the drama taking place within it, is sort of surreal -- the biting cold weather that makes you feel it should just hurry up and snow or do something. The slow movement of the story and the bizarre zombie action scenes add to the drama an edgy yet dreamlike quality, like the feeling of getting only a couple hours of sleep a night when duty calls.I like the first person perspective of this book, and I really liked the characterization of Barb Lightner; being a lone female too I appreciate many of her qualities.The misspellings and errors in the book are seriously lame though; kids are probably reading these books, and (hopefully not) learning to spell ""depression"" with one 's' and ""every"" as ""very"". (....)"
5,it has changed my life,"i have been following this program of eating for 4 1/2 months...longer than any diet i have ever been on in my life..i have no cravings....did you hear that?......i have NO cravings..i used to live from one craving to the next...i was the queen of junkfood...and now i couldn't care less about the foods i thought i couldn't live without...my clothes are hanging on me....i'm shrinking.......if i can do this,ANYONE CAN....."
5,The no diet book,I found this book to be interesting and off beat to the usual diet books and mags that I have read.recently.
3,A Different Technique to Dieting,"I've got mixed feelings on this book. First, the author is not a doctor or nutritionist or any other heath professional. There is absolutely no science behind his program. However, this program did work for this regular guy in a big way. The big parts of the program are to eat your main protein meal at lunch, stay away from processed foods (i.e. white stuff), and eat nothing but fruit for dinner.He does tell you to eat till you are satisfied. He claims it's the foods impact on your body that gets the weight off, but when you compare what he ate before - it's still a ton less calories!!!! I do like the just eat fruit for dinner, no calorie counting or measuring or weighing but just fruit is tough when you have 3 kids eating DINNER and your having.... grapes. The Turkey Taco Soup recipe is delicious, and when I did the math it's 175 calories for a cup. The book is worth it just just the recipes."
3,Let's Do Lunch - Not Quite The Miracle Diet,"Let's Do Lunch is the story of one man's amazing weight loss journey. I admire Wilson for his life changing dieting progress. I think the book is great but I also think it is a bit misleading. ""Eating all the calories and carbs you want to lose weight!"" is on the cover and really gives the wrong impression. While the statement may be true factually, I feel it conveys the wrong message. Wilson's diet program is somewhat unique and many people may find it to be the answer they have been searching for. However many others may not be able to live happily eating the same way and will fail in yet another diet program.The book makes for good reading, and maybe you can find some of the dieting answers you are looking for. However if you read the cover and get excited about eating everything you want and still losing weight, you need to reconsider."
3,A healthy weight loss plan,"In this book Troy Wilson reveals how he was able to loose over 200 lbs eating all the calories and carbs that he wanted. He even promises you results without exercising. He shares his own personal program for success and includes lots of recipes.This book was interesting to me as I'm working on losing weight, post pregnancy. While none of the information he shared was new or groundbreaking for me I know it would be very new to most American's. With the health knowledge that I do have I disagree with some of his methods or advice for long term maintenance but overall it is an excellent plan if someone is wanting to drop the pounds.I did glean some helpful ideas and recipes from this book and I would recommend it to others."
4,New diet,I was so excited to receive this book as i have tried all the diets out there. In this book Roger talks about his success and failures in all diet plans and shares letters from people he has helped. This book was an inspiration to me in my goal to lose a few pounds. I would highly recommend this book.
5,WOW!,"I can now walk past the candy and chip isles in the grocery store and not want them. I have never in my life been able to say those words. I surfed by Let's Do Lunch on Amazon a month ago and decided to give it a try. (Since I have tried everything else, why not this too?) What a novel approach to weight loss. I hesitate to call this plan a diet because what other plan let's you eat from all the food groups and eat until you are full? No measuring, weighing, or counting calories. I feel better, sleep better and have stopped craving the foods that are so bad for my body. Roger Troy gives amazing support on his web site Letsdolunch.com. He ALWAYS answers any questions I have. It's like having my own personal diet guru! I thank you Roger Troy and I thank God for leading me to your wonderful book Let's Do Lunch."
5,The Best of the Best,I had tried so many diets that when I seen this advertised in our local newspaper I was kind of skittish about it but thought what the heck I might as well give it a try. In the first 3 to 4 months I lost 42 lbs. and then after 1 year I lost 87 lbs and then after 2 years I'm down 107 lbs. It is a great diet and I would reccomend it to anyone that is over weight. I also had diabetes which I don't have anymore because of the way I eat I don't even have to take insulin anymore. Thank God for Roger Troy Wilson and his Let's Do Lunch. Bren
5,It Works!,"I have been on this diet for 8 months. It does work! You may have to read the book several times, then use it for a reference occasionally. Let's Do Lunch.com also helps you along with the book. This is a healthy way to eat the rest of your life. I have lost 46lbs and no cravings for things I shouldn't be eating. This is a God inspired diet that does answer prayer. Yes, I still have more weight to lose,but it's not a struggle to eat this way. Thank you God and Roger Troy Wilson for helping so many people to live healthier lives."
1,Lets do Lunch... another time!!,"Well, Im going to be honest. I havent read this book because I received it with pages and pages of Corrections included with the book. Before I read this book, Im supposed to go through and make ALL of these changes to certain paragraphs. I paid full price for the book thru the Let's Do Lunch"" web site so that I could edit the whole book..... I dont think so. My mistake.I dont know if there is a way to find out if the book you are ordering is mistake free, but I would try to find out before you place your order or waste your time."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!!,"I was sooooo....eager to start on this diet despite the fact that I am not a fruit eater. The diet is essentially a healthy one but not something that the average non-fruit eater could stick with. I purchased the book and read it from cover to cover in one sitting and immediately started the next day. For several days I made fruit smoothies for breakfasts and I tried a lot of different variations but I just could not even make myself like them. Although the author constantly says throughout the book that the diet is not a fruit diet, I beg to differ. Let's do lunch is a FRUIT DIET!!! If you do not like fruit you will not be successful with this plan. I had several questions that I needed clarity on and I emailed the author via the website and he never even responded to my email. Don't waste your money on this book and don't bother to try this diet if you don't like fruit!!!"
3,Just another diet,"This was a very quick read. And although this diet did wonders for Mister Wilson, it was nothing we, who stuggle with weight control, haven't heard or read about before."
2,Hope you like fruit!,I had some high hopes with this....especially when he kept saying this isn't a fruit diet.This is yet another diet that worked well for HIM....I don't care for fruit...so not a good diet for me. I also am not a snacker...so the frozen grapes weren't even that good to me.
2,Too good to be true Diet Book,"In a nutshell:Book claims you can eat all you want of any food you want, when you want, not exercise, and lose weight.Author was a big fat guy continuous eating fast food, any food, all day and all night. He was addicted to food. Then he tried different diets and none of them worked. So he made up his own diet after praying to God about it and lost a bunch of weight eating frozen grapes. (Oh, and he got a tummy tuck to get his abs flat)His diet: eat fruit, don't eat dairy, don't eat carbs except beans, no snacking between meals, protein only allowed at lunchProbably pretty safe for most people, but you have to follow his fruit, no dairy, and no carb plan. Weight loss comes with calorie restriction only and this diet works by filling you up with grapes. I am all for praying to God, but God may have a different diet for you than this guy who is selling this book."
1,It should be called the fruit diet,I was very disappointed with this book it claimed to diet using all food groups but it is just a spin off of the atkins diet with the acception of adding fruit. I'm glad the diet worked for the author but I feel he false advertises this diet.
5,It Works,"I am on my way of being that small lady again. This works and makes sense..He, takes you step by step."
5,Sounds Good,"I bought this book for my son. At first I didn't think he would do anything.Now he is using the book and eating all the food that he really likes anyway. Think it has been two weeks and he has lost weight. His wife has decided that she will eat right along with him. They didn't have to go out and buy ""diet"" food. He is making his own ground chicken, turkey and serloin. So far so good. Now they cookand freeze so they have it ready."
5,Finally an eating plan that really works.,"Let's Do Lunch: Eating all the Calories and Carbs you want to lose weight!Now here's an eating plan that really works to help you lose weight and eat healthy. If you are serious about following this plan, the book is a must have. I have read the book three times and learn something new each time. I've followed the plan for 2 1/2 months and lost 29 lbs. It truly works!!"
2,"Let's do lunch, or not...","Let's Do Lunch by Roger Wilson isn't exactly my idea of a good read. The book is a diet book authored by a man who lost a ton of weight by eating much healthier. It's not exactly news that by substituting fruits for refined sugar or veggies for bread you will be healthier and have less problems with weight. The problem most people have is the addiction to refined sugar and bread and Wilson does not give any solution to that problem except get rid of the tempting foods and replace them with the healthier ones. I am happy for Roger and those who have lost weight by using this method, but this is one book that I do not plan to pick up again."
2,Wouldnt live by it.,"I think there are indeed some great weight loss tips and ideas in this book. However I know, from personal family experience, that you can OD on potassium found in grapes. I doubt that most people can eat their weight in grapes each week and come out of it just fine. Each person is different and each `diet' should be tailored to their specific needs. The fact that he loves corn and processed `diet aids' like I can't believe its not butter just prove to me that writing a book doesn't mean it is a good idea to live by. The book does give some tips to live by but I was let down by this book."
3,Borderline,"The plot is like a Mister Potato Head mixture of various standard mystery plots, yet it ends up being a pretty good tale. The writer needs to stay away from adult material until she can do it with competence, and sometimes she gets a bit didactic about native lore, but it was worth the purchase."
2,Why?,"would you need a book for a game like this? Something like Morrowind, that's understandable, but this game is fairly straitforward and each time you make the wrong choice, you get to redo that scene. Plus, there are free walk-thrus available online."
4,Fahrenheit Strategy Guide review,"Upon buying the Fahrenheit game, I guessed that a strategy guide would be necessary, and I was correct. Luckily, this strategy guide is everything you'll ever need and more. You'll probably want to play the game through without consulting the guide, but when you do get stuck the guide offers invaluable advice without spoiling the plot, which is vital in a game such as this. The book itself is also a highly enjoyable read and is recommended for any lover of videogames. This guide, and comprehensively the game, is a must-have for gamers of any type."
4,Fast Service,"quick and fast service, placed the order, received email confirmation, received item in a couple of days."
5,Modern Poets at Their Best...,"This book is spectacular. It contains lots of poetry, prose, and art from the contemporary indie/punk/hardcore/emo scene. Much of the poetry is so original and moving. I personally loved it and constantly find myself flipping through it. Some bands that have contributed works include Silverstein, Taking Back Sunday, The Bled, Boys Night Out, From Autumn to Ashes, This Day Forward, Planes Mistaken For Stars, The Starting Line, Fear Before The March of Flames, and many more. For a good handle on modern poetry, or if you like any of these bands pick up this book. You wont regret it. Plus, its pink! You can walk around showing off to all your hipster friends! Two scene points for you!"
2,"Some interesting ideas, but I wanted it to be over","It had some interesting ideas, but probably not enough to recommend it. Too much of the book was spent describing daily activities and life back in medieval times. I wanted the book to be over. Sexual content: moderate."
3,Mediocre,more like science fiction. Recommended for those who like science fiction. I like more believable stories.I would not recommend to any of my friends.
4,Angel Sanctuary Series,"I was turned onto this series just by it's beautiful artwork. The syle is truely unique and angelic...no wounder it's about angels.The story starts off as a young teenage boy soon finds out that he is in love with is sister! As if that could be strange wait till you here this. The boy, Setsuna, is the re-incarnation of one of the most powerful angel's in history; and now people all over heaven and hell want him.What will it take to convince Setsuna, that he is greatly needed by humanity...I hope you thought this useful...Hypnotic~"
4,4.5 stars if I could,"This was actually an amazon suggestion based on some other manga that I had searched for and some that I bought, and I picked up volume 1 to see if it was any good. I found the story and characters to be interesting and the artwork to be superb as well. I am interested to see where the story progresses at least enough to buy volume 2 and see where it goes from there. This is more than I can say for the ""Loveless"" series which is also a five-star rated item on amazon. The author/artist breeches some interesting topics and you can tell while reading that the imagination behind this story is vast and there will be much more creativity poured into the rest of the series as well. I give this one a high reccomendation, 4.5 stars if I could. The 1/2 point deduction is only because i had a bit of trouble following some of the characters, but i think this is a fault of my own for being a newbie manga reader."
4,Wonderful,This CD is heavanly!So sweet yet powerful vocals! A sure favorite of anyone who loves great music!Even if you don't understand Italian Giorgia's voice Is HEAVANLY!
2,Limited use,"This book gives you very quick (and not terribly useful science reviews) and a bunch of practice questions, which are useful as drills but nothing like the MCAT questions. It's not really worth the money unless you like doing lots of short answer drills to help you memorizations"
3,Sad,"The quality of these dvds is good. However, I was disappointed at the, so sorry to say, terrible playing by Paul Tortelier of these Bach Suites. Paul is one of my all time favorite cellists of this century. I have heard him play these suites live at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. That was over 30 years ago, and he was amazing. He is quite old in these dvds and I felt sad to sit and hear/watch him fumble through these with poor intonation and his normally smooth, fluid playing was jerky... all age, I suppose."
3,Many repetitive and simple expressions.,"This book contains a lot of expressions, indeed. Some of which are more common than others. Although, beware that unless your American English is very basic, a lot of these expressions you are likely to already be familiar with. Many expressions are also almost identical, with just a different word order, or one or two words replaced. To give an example, the book gives you the following three suggestions (among others) to express that you feel cool or cold: ""Turn on the heat"", ""Turn up the heat"", ""Turn the heat up"".With that in mind, I would still say the book is worth its price. I just think that the author could have left out a lot of variations of the expressions and saved some pages."
5,Dictionary of American Expression,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anybody could buy for their very own personal time and pleasure.
5,NTC's Dictionary of Everyday American English Expressions,I was so surprised on how this book explains using expressions in different situations. It help me to speak English . Thank you so much.
4,Great jacket for great price!!,"I was looking to replace an older NorthFace, needed a hood, had to be lightweight yet warm and had to fit a wider hip. This coat fit the bill exactly. Could use a few more pockets and pass holder, but this coat was close to what I wanted and what a price! It kept me warm skiing in the teens, highly recommended."
4,an encyclopedia of the Ripper,"This book is basically an alphabetized glossary of every person that conceivably had anything to do with the Jack the Ripper story. Even masochist-poet Algernon Charles Swinburne was proposed as a Ripper suspect! It's an intriguing and helpful catologue of names and brief biographies focusing on Ripper connections. This book will appeal especially to those readers who already have some knowledge of the case from books.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
1,No good,"This book was in terrible shape not very good condition like the seller listed. Smelled, yellow pages that fell out when I looked thru the book. Writing on pages.. I wish I had never wasted my money on it cause its in the trash now where it belongs. Shame on them for saying it was in very good codition when they knew it was'nt."
3,size matters,"Hello,I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback and he is 28 inches tall at the shoulders. I liked this product a lot but I wish that it came in a taller/higher size? I am assuming that I am not the only person that has run into this problem? Oh well, I thought I would share. I found many that will work for us. But none that had a little style like this one.Thx, David"
1,Elevated Feeder- not correct size very misleading,"The Feeder is a nice design but the advertizing is incorrect and misleading. The two bowls together are not even the size of a medium size bowl. The bowls should be LARGE enough for a LARGE/MEDIUM dog... Not the manner in which it is advertized as ""two bowls 2 qts."" Very dishonest. Each bowl is therefore barely a quart !!!"
3,"Mechanically works, but does not stop my old stubborn dog from barking","This really does spray every time my 13.5 yr old Barney barks. That doesn't stop him from barking, however, so I have given up on it. He is very old, deaf, and a little senile, so hopefully it will work much better for your dog. We got him just a yr ago so he's already set in his ways. This collar is humane and worth a try, in my opinion. I suppose next I'll try one of those ultrasonic noise collars. These are not cheap experiments, unfortunately. What we do for our furry babies....."
5,GREAT product!,"I bought this for my 2 year old Westie. We live on a golf course and loves to bark as the golfers go by. When he first got sprayed by the collar, he really freaked out and ran the other way. It took him several days to connect the barking with the spraying (he must have thought God was just punishing him). He was actually afraid to go outside at all for awhile, we had to encourage him to go out into the yard. But eventually he got it, and now it works wonderfully!! He doesn't even bark when we forget to put the collar on him anymore. Its so nice to have peace and quiet, and know we're not driving the neighbors and golfers crazy."
5,great product,"I have a very talkative young beagle. Afer maybe 2 days, he doesn't even have to wear it. I just pick it up and show it to him and he gets very quiet. Great product"
2,Works but not effective,"The collar works as described however, it's not effective. Our dog does not miss a step (or bark) when it goes off. On the plus side, the house smells nice and the mosquitoes stay away!"
1,Did Not Work,"My dog was startled when she was first sprayed, and then startled again a few times after. But after the first few sprays, she could have cared less and just yapped the day away with the collar spraying all over the place. She smelled like a mosquito repellent candle for a week until I finally gave up."
2,Yummy......I want more!,Our dog loved the citranella spray so much that he barked more just to get another wiff. We realized the solution to our problem is probably not in a can.
1,Did not work for our dog,"This product did not work for our dog. However, I did appreciate being warned that it was not returnable to Amazon. So, I purchased it at a local pet store and was able to return it. We are on plan C now. Using the new Sunbeam shock bark collar. It was affordable ($50) and has a second set of long probes that cut through our dog's dense fur. So far so good."
1,Way to sensitive,"This collar will spray at the slightest sound or movement. Unless you want your dog to lay perfectly still all day, this won't work. My dog gets sprayed constantly - and it can 't be returned. Although it also sprays when he barks."
2,My dog still barks,My little dog still barks when using the collar. My house smells like citronella though...
5,an incredible product,"my adorable bichon/mini poodle had suddenly started waking up and barking when the newspaper was delivered. i even cancelled my subscription to the paper and my dog was still waking up and barking at things in the middle of the night. it had really become intolerable and i was becoming sleep-deprived despite trying everything to quiet him down. this collar worked like a charm! it startled the little guy the first time it sprayed like you wouldn't believe, and i had to stifle a laugh. he barked a second time that first night and that was it. he's only barked one other time in the week or so i've had it on him. one spray and he quiets down immediately, and now i'm getting some sleep and my incredibly patient neighbors won't hate me. my little rescue dog is back to being his adorable, playful self. he's even barking less during the day too when he doesn't have the collar on. i couldn't be happier."
5,The best thing ever!!,"""AMAZING! I have a 1 yr old dog, her mix is lab/beagle/blue heeler and hounddog. That alone tells you she is quite the barker. We were at our wits end and were afraid to let her out in the backyard due to her nuisance barking at squirrels. She barked twice wearing this collar and has now completely stopped barking. We don't even have to turn it on, just wearing it and she knows not to bark."""
1,DON'T BUY,"I have purchased 4 of these collars and while they work great for controlling barking problems, 3 of them stopped working in less than 30 days. Because the spray is considered hazardous you can't return them which makes for an even bigger inconvenience."
1,doesn't work,Please do not waste your money. I am very disappointed that it says you can't return the item. It does not work at all. It sprays but it will spray my dog for no reason. He wasn't even barking and it would spray him in the face.
2,Bark Collar,"We were so excited that this would be the perfect solution to our Shitzu barking when we weren't home or even if we just were outside. The first day it seemed to malfunction right from the start. When he barked it would spray multiple times, it should let off one spray for each bark. Still it seemed to stop his barking for the first day or two. After that he seemed to not be bothered by the spray at all and actually would lick his nose after being sprayed. We continued to use the collar, hoping for positive results, but the battery was dead after approx two weeks. I attempted to get a new battery at multiple locations. Apparently you can only order them online. The concept is excellent but the results not so good."
4,Works as advertised,"I'm not really interested in shocking my dog for 100% results, but this product has probably decreased her barking by 90% which is commendable. The spray is around $10/bottle which is a little bit expensive, but I would definitely recommend this collar."
2,wouldn't recommend,We used it on our pug. The first two days we could really tell that it was working. After that second day the spray didn't bother our pug one bit. In less than a week of wearing the collar for approx. 8 hours a day he barked through an entire container of spray. We decided in not purchasing any more citronella.
1,Don't buy this collar!,"I bought this collar less than a month ago and have had nothing but trouble. It sprays when the collar hits the window when she puts her head out to feel the breeze. It also sprays when she is just sitting doing nothing. She is confused as to what it is for and, frankly, so am I! Amazon won't take it back because the Citronella is under pressure in the collar. So, my advice is ""Do Not Buy This Collar""."
2,doesn't work for me,"I was hoping so much that this would work but it doesn't for me. It startled her the first time but then after that, back to barking."
4,Works great for my Maltipom! I am shocked!,I dropped one star since the battery ran out after 9 days. I even turned the battery off at night. I am pleased overall and am ordering another for my Westie.
2,Disappointment,I bought this for my pug mix after getting too many complaints from my roommates about barking while I was gone. I wanted to try this before getting a shock collar because my dog is pretty sensitive to discipline. I thought this collar was going to be great because she barked once and she did NOT like getting sprayed... unfortunately 30 seconds later she just shook her head because the device is uncomfortable and it sprayed her. So then she was very confused and didn't trust anything while wearing it and just cowered in a corner. I feel it is too inhumane to make her wear it.. disappointed.
2,Don't buy it if you have two dogs!!,"Last year we took in a rescue and she decided to protect her new home by barking at any noise, people walking by with dogs, no dogs, strollers...anything. When it was not the by-passers then the squirrels in the trees. We have another 6 year old who never was a big barker, and so there were no problems with neighbors. Since nothing seems to work (click/reward system, being firm) we decided to go with a bark control collar. As we thought using a e-collar for a rescue, who just moved in new surroundings is too much.The first time she barked with it, she was startled by the citronella and stopped. Wow, we thought, maybe that will do it. Unfortunately it didn't, she would bark right through it. The whole house would smell like citronella. Another problem was that it would go off when our second dog would bark, punishing her for no reason.If you have a dog with hyper personality, you might be wasting your money."
3,Works fairly well - but effects not permanent,"I'm no dog expert or barking expert. We have two 15-25 lbs terriers and one of them loved to bark at anything/everything that walked by the house. When the collar is on him, he never barks and seems almost 'neutered' (pardon the pun). The effect seems to last a few hours after taking the collar off, but we havent been successful in taming his barking habits.Overall, it is still a good product since it does curb his immediate barking and is great for when people are visiting."
5,quite at last,"This product works like a charm, it is so peaceful not to have my dog barking at everbody that goes by the window, we are both much happier."
5,Best invention ever!,We have two dogs. A black labrador and a rat terrier. Love to bark at night. Rat terrier would even bark at me every time I would come home. Telling him to shut up never worked. Those no bark devices u place outside complete waste of money. So we put these thing on these guys every night and not a peep and if there is a peep its the first peep and ten no more. Works like magic. We have been using these for about a month now. Perfect results. Only thing I want to tell you is when u take them off they are going to bark again. Still works! Buy it and your neighbors will love you!
4,Don't love the smell but liking the results,"Our dog is REALLY quiet unless he hears something outside out door and then he does what I call his ""death bark"" sounding like he is going to kill someone. And since we live in an apartment there are noises outside our door a lot. We got this on a whim to give it a shot despite the bad reviews and BAM! It works. The first couple times he stopped in his tracks mid bark and run to the dog confused by the spray. The first couple days of it he would whine for a while afterward out of confusion but now he thinks before he barks. He still has let a few barks out but not nearly as many and it has only been a week.Sorry to those who it didn't work for, I can see why it might not work for some, but it works for us, thank goodness."
5,Have a barker in the house?,"This collar works! My extreme barker let fly a couple of times when I let him out for potty in the dark. Deer and anything in the yard sets him off. Things he can't see sets him off. A box on the counter sets him off. This collar, once they understand the concept, doesn't even have to be turned on. He only wears it when he goes out and then it comes off, hung by the door. Now he doesn't even have to wear it, he has stopped his very sharp and incessant barking and my neighbors can sleep at 4:30 in the morning! What a difference. What a relief!Oh! I got it at amazon for less than half the price from the petstores."
3,"Not great, but good","When I first put the battery in the collar, it went nuts and sprayed continuously for several seconds. I haven't had any issues since then, but my dog is terrified of it because of the initial spray. This is a replacement for a different brand that I could no longer find."
5,Works perfectly,Worked right away. My dog barked once and then realized she didn't want to do it anymore if the collar is on. Now when she starts to bark we jus put on the collar and it's done. If you're looking for a humane solution to a barking problem this is a great place to start.
1,Sprays for no reason: very stressful and confusing for the dogs,"One of the two collars I received sprayed randomly. The other one didn't during the time I tested them but both went off with head shaking, yawning and sneezing. My dogs were very anxious about the whole experience. I'm being sent replacements. Not sure if they'll be any better.UPDATED:I was sent two new devices that were supposed to have been tested before they were sent. I put them on my dogs, who were extremely anxious (shaking) from the last experience, and waited. I tried to calm them down by feeding treats. One of the collars went off while the dog took a treat. Needless to say, my dog was extremely confused and refused to take any treats for 24 hours after that. I took both collars off. Very frustrating especially since they worked SO WELL in stopping the barking."
1,Does not work!,"First off the shipping took forever, I received the collar, put it on my dog one day. Then all of a sudeen it stopped working. So we got new batteries and it still does not work. And now I am unable to send it back because it is a ""hazardous"" material!!! I am extremely upset that I wasted 40 DOLLARS for nothing!"
4,Kind way to stop barking,This collar works by just putting on - very seldom has it sprayed. I have used this collar in the past and it truly discourages dog barking.
2,broke after 2 weeks,stopped spraying after 2 weeks....very disappointed. i really needed this product to work. I am trying to train a dog since my neighbor is complaining. this product is making a tough situation even tougher.
5,great product,"This product is spectacular it works like magic.We have a three years old dog that barks at everything the mailman, a person passing by, a squirrel at everything as soon as we put the collar to our dog and he heard and smelled the noise of the spray he stopped barking instantly. Even when he is not using it he does not bark as much as he used to. I highly recommend this product is like buying a peace of mind!!!!"
2,Doesn't Work :-(,"We bought this for our 9 months old puppy & it doesn't work, he got use to the smell, so we were very unhappy with the product. Don't believe the great reviews and judge by that. Thats what i did :-( thats why i purchased and it stinks :-("
5,Amazing Results!,"It took just 3 barks for this amazing collar to stop our dog from her nuisance barking. She is happy and calm, as are we and the neighbors!"
5,Works great!!,"Works great on my 20lb puggle. My puggle barks like crazy on walks at other dogs. Now with the spray collar it is a more enjoyable walk.Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella"
5,Works Great!!!!,This product works from the minute you put it on! I tried some of the other methods but this is a safe and effective way to help decrease your dogs nuisance barking.
2,Send the registration card in!,"I purchased this collar October '09 and when I tried to refill it today, it just leaked the charge out around a seam. So it lasted just over three months. I did not register the item within the 15-30 day window so the 1 year warranty is void. I don't know if they would have covered it, there's lots of wiggle room in the wording of the warranty. It did not get rough treatment. I used the same brand to recharge it. It worked for my mini-schnauzer's barking but not as well as the shock collar set low. When it spritzed him he acted way more ""shocked"" than with the actual shock collar, like he imagined a viper hissing at him."
3,Worked with a little help,"We have a ten pound chihuahua....who likes to bark. We don't mind her barking at appropriate times but when someone comes to the house she gets in this zone and barks till we are afraid she will spill her innards onto the floor. We wanted something to snap her out of that zone and get her to calm down a little quicker. The problem we had with this collar is that it was SUPER sensitive! She shakes quite a bit and every time she did she would get sprayed! Not good! So I took a piece of the clear medical tape...the kind with the small holes in it...and put it over the sensor. Worked like a charm! No more accidental spraying but it still worked when she got to barking! Now, has it cured her hyper-focused barking...no. But at least it quiets her enough that we don't go insane, we can actually hear what our guest is saying when they come and we are able to get her attention now instead of losing her to the barking zone!"
5,Fantastic!!,"Wish I had bought this a long time ago! We have a Jack Russell who loves to go out in our backyard in the evenings and bark, nonstop. We were constantly calling here back in the house, she would beg to go back out, it was a vicious cycle. I was really not sure this would work but willing to try anything. Gotta say pretty much after the first spritz of citronella she was a changed dog. As long as she has the collar on no barking and she really does not ask to go out much. One thing I would suggest if you do have the collar on and turned on, make sure you watch for your dog to come to the door to ask to come in. So they don't have to bark to come in. Would highly recommend this and follow the directions."
1,Didn't work,"I have a german shepherd/husky mix that barks when she is kenneled. The collar initially surprised her, but it did not make her stop barking. It just makes her smell like citronella. There are a number of issues with it: For one, she has a lot of fur, and the collar gets lost in the fur and doesn't really spray like it should. For another, it fits awkwardly and tends to flip upside down so it's actually just spraying into her chest. Finally, it doesn't hold enough spray, and she learned very quickly that once it's out, she can bark freely. It just wasn't enough of a deterrent for her, I guess. I'm not really a fan of this sort of training, anyway - spraying a dog in the face or shocking them when they are barking out of stress to begin with doesn't seem like the best method. I'll be honest - I was looking for a quick and easy fix - I'll be returning to positive reinforcement and a consistent training regime to work through the barking with my dog."
1,Bad design,The Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar is poorly designed. The plastic loops through which the collar slides are centered on the device. They should be located near the top where the spray outlet is located. As designed the device flips bottom up instead of toward the animals head. I would not recomment this product.
3,Spray collar ok,"This collar is ok but not awesome. I noticed that it goes off when my dog shakes his head the way dogs do often. Also the collar itself is very cheaply made and my dog got it off and ate it after the first day. Aside from that, its ok."
1,poor product information,I bought three of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. When they came I found that the dogs need skin contact to work and my breed has chest hair. Can't use this product without cutting their hair and as they are show dogs I won't do that. It should be on the product information that this is for short haired dogs. Also it's not returnable as citronella is considered toxic and can't be sent back.
1,Returns,"I am not happy with the return policy of this item. The items I recived were to big for my dogs and I am unable to return them, even though they have never been used."
1,Very disappointed,"We've had had alot of problems with our blue heeler barking uncontrollably whenever visitors stop at the house. We were hoping this would deter her barking by at least 50% to something tolerable. Boy, were we disappointed.At first, the spray startled her but did not stop her from barking. After getting used to the spray, it doesn't even surprize her anymore. It just makes the house smell like citronella as she barks away until the visitors are gone (and these are people that frequently visit).I purchased another three cans thinking it would just take a little longer but it looks like it will be a wasted effort. We opted to purchase the spray collar instead of the shock collar thinking it would be the more humane approach to breaking the annoying habit. When given a 50/50 chance.......well, that's why I don't go to the casino."
1,Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar does not work,Don't waste your money... first time in years that I have been disappointed with a product that I purchased. This collar had no effect on our barking dog. $36.00 and our dog barks right through until it runs out of citronella. Has no affect what-so-ever. I really regret my purchase. Read the fine print. This item is listed as hazardous material and it can not be returned. I just threw $36.00 dollars away. I hope I can save someone from a really wasteful purchase.
1,Poor Pup Gets Sprayed When Shaking!,The sensor on this collar does not work at all. It cannot tell the difference between the vibration from a bark and from a shake or any kind of disturbance to the collar. He gets sprayed for no reason and is very confused. This collar does not work at all.
2,Collars seem to be defective,"I have had this collar before and it was better than a Petsafe collar for which I paid $125. However,, i have been disappointed with the 2 I recently ordered. They do not spray when the dogs bark. I have not been able to get either one to work ."
2,Did not work for my dog,"The collar is built well, but it only holds less than 10 sprays. My 5 month old Pup would bark/shake her head and bark again until it was empty then just bark. I went through the entire bottle in a single day and it pretty much does not work.NOTE: YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT IF YOU BUY ON AMAZON!! So make sure you are ok with that. PetSmart won't do anything about it."
1,this collar is awful,"I ordered this collar to keep my dog from waking up the house when I'm getting the ready for work at 5am. Sure the citronella spray would keep my dog from barking, but it also keeps him from moving! He walked two steps and the thing started spraying him in the face and wouldn't stop. I can't even return it because the citronella spray is considered hazardous material. What a waste of money! Don't buy this product!"
1,What no returns - how about telling me that before I buy,"Ok so I was really excited about this humane way of getting my barking 5 year old vizsla to calm down. I get the product and it works all right - it sprayed my dog when she jumped on the bed, when she moved during her nap, and a couple of other non barking, non noise induced times. So now she is slightly more neurotic wondering why she is getting sprayed in the face every few minutes.I was looking for a way to return it - after searching the website I found there is no return because they consider the spray can to be a hazardous material - so then why were they able to ship it to me?I just searched the purchase page to see where it said that I cannot return it, it doesn't say it anywhere. I used 1-click so there were no other notifications anywhere telling me that I am now $37 poorer and stuck with a defective item.I'm really disappointed and will reconsider ordering from amazon in the future!"
1,Too Big!,"I ordered this for a 4-5 lb Yorkie. It is WAY too big!! I wanted to return it, but Amazon will not allow returns on this product because ""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.""I'm very disappointed because I was lead to believe that 1) it would fit a small dog 2) it cannot be returned"
3,anti-bark collar,I purchased this product for my yorkie who barks constantly only when people visit. She is 9 pounds. I have not used the collar yet because the part that attaches to the collar seems to be big for my small dog and I am not sure how she will react to that. I am going to try it eventually. I just wish the box that holds the citronella would have been smaller. The product was delivered in a timely fashion.
1,Worked great until it stopped working,"First spray, and my dog's barking stopped! It only took a few sprays for him to connect the dots. Soon, all I had to do was put the collar on him and it was quite times in my house. After a couple of months, the thing stopped working. I refilled it. I changed the battery...and nothing. Now, I see on someone else's review that I can't return it to Amazon so I'm reluctant to purchase a new one from Amazon."
1,"Bad collar, bad collar!","This collar simply didn't work. I followed the directions, very simple really, and nothing. I made sure the reservoir was full, checked and rechecked the on/off switch, having my dog bark with it both ways - nothing. As a last resort, I took the battery to a battery shop to have it tested and the battery was good, but the collar is a dud. To add insult to injury I find out only after this experience, and deciding to return my defective collar, that Amazon has a no returns policy on this collar. Save your money and buy something else, I wish I had.UPDATE: Just to set the record straight, Amazon has refunded my cost of the collar. Thank you Amazon!"
2,Didn't work for me,"Was interested in something a little more humane than a shock coller for our Aussie shepherd. It's somewhat their breeds demeanor to bark, but we are trying to curtail it as not to upset the neighbors. She barks when playing fetch (barks until you throw the ball, barks at our other dog when he gets the ball, etc). The first few times she barked, it worked. She appeared to be confused and stopped barking. However, she quickly got used to the spray and it did not phase her one bit. She was barking constantly, and a near-constant spray of the Citronella did not affect her one bit.If your dog barks just occasionally, this very well may work. However, if your dog is a nuisance barker who barks continuously, you may want to try another product."
1,Item defective,"The collar worked for the first few days then it stopped working. I ordered new batteries and replaced them, refilled the collar and it worked for a few minutes then nothing. I tried to return it and Amazon doesn't accept it as a return because it contains the citronella spray, which is considered hazmat. The fact that it was not a returnable item should be noted in the listing. Amazon quickly resolved the issue when I contacted them through chat."
4,Stop the barking,"This device provides an effective way to help a dog from unnessary barking. After wearing the collar for a short time, the dog only needs to see the collar to stop barking. It is a little big for small dogs."
4,only thing that worked for our Great Dane mix,"we have 2 great dane mixes (M-145lbs, F-135lbs), and they like to bark at the bunny's in our yard. I've tried shock bark collars and shock training collars too(only works when we were home to push the shock button). our female Dane would just keep barking and not really care she was getting shocked. I almost gave up and then thought I would try one more time. I read the reviews and ordered this collar. IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!! who knew she would dislike getting sprayed more than getting shocked? but, she is now quiet while she watches the bunny's and our neighbors are greatful we found a solution. now we will buy one for her brother too. the one draw back (4 stars instead of 5)was the cheap collar that comes with it, as another reviewer also noted. I just replaced it with a new nylon collar and its a perfect solution for us."
2,"Too big, can't return","The product description says that it works on all sizes of dog. I have a 12-pound JRT-Chihuahua mix who is an insane barker. Three years of training hasn't worked and we needed something (our mailman changed routes because of her, and we have a baby who I'd like to nap). I was worried about shock collars on such a small dog. However, the unit on this was way too big for her little neck. It is heavy and bulky. It would have been fine if she were just sitting or standing all the time, but she couldn't lie down with it on. She was so uncomfortable. I need something she can wear all the time because I never know when someone is going to come to the door. Of course you have to cut the collar to make it fit so now I can't return it. I wanted to like this but it turned out to be a waste of time and money. We ended up getting a shock collar--the unit is smaller and in the end more effective for us."
1,Useless - don't waste your time and money,Worked one time on my little rat terrier. Then went off every time she shook her head or even moved suddenly!Next it proceeded to completely empty out all the citronella!I reccommend trying something else...Currently trying to get my money back from Amazon - website says you can't return pressurized vessels - even if they don't have any pressure because they are BROKEN
5,Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar,"This the most fantastic solution for a barking WestHighland Terrier or any dog that barks. Our Westie (5yrs old) had been almost impossible to stop his constant barking.Our Vet suggested this spray collar and it immediately stopped the barking after the first squirt of the citronella.After a month of using the collar, he seldom barks but grumps instead.If I remove the collar he eventually discovers his barking, so I put the collar on (without turning the battery on) and he is cured again. Sometimes he gets in a bark or two and I will have to turn on the battery again.Basically, our house is now VERY quiet!!!"
1,Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar,"I received the Innotek Collar that was suppossed to be for ""small"" dogs. It was very loose on our Yorkie. I filled it with the spray and it did work but the collar was just too big. I called to try to return it and was told I could not because of the spray. SO, I wasted $40 and do not have a product that I can use. My advice-------------------- DO NOT BUY FOR A DOG UNDER 10 LBS."
4,No BARK,"I love this product. I have to small dogs that would bark ALL the time. This product works right away. It sprayed them when they bark. They will bark when I take it off, but it is much less. I'm sure my neighbors are very happy. Do not pay more than $40. Shop around I found this site for alot less than others."
5,Citronella antibark collar works!,My 18 lb border terrier isn't a terrible barker but can sometimes get carried away if she sees a deer or critter. I mostly use it when I don't want her to bother the neighbors. Especially late night or early morning. I just snap it on her and I don't hear a peep. First time it sprayed it did scare her but now I wonder if she doesn't bark just because I put it on her. I like the fact that it doesn't cause her any physical pain.
3,Does not work on Beagles,"I have a Barky Beagle Buster that loves to Howl at everyone and everything. He is a nuissance barker when outside and I wanted to control the barking in softest way. Unfortuneatly a spray in the face was not going to stop him! The product was fine, it was the dog that was the issue, he grew to like it! I recently purchased the PetSafe electronic bark shock collar which works awsome on him!!"
2,Effective but stopped working,This worked really well for a few weeks and then just stopped working. Not a reliable product for $50+.
2,stopped functioning after a few months,I purchased two collars and both worked great for a few months. Then they stopped working. I replaced the batteries and kept refilling the spray; still they wouldn't work. They were good while they lasted but they just didn't last long.
2,Worked at first.,"We bought this collar because our dog barks at his own shadow! Spraying him with water and verbally scolding him did not work. This collar seemed to work at first. My 22 lb dog would wear it and it would stop his barking very quickly. After 2 weeks he didn't care if the collar sprayed him, he would continue to bark and get sprayed over and over. Waste of money. Going to have to try another method!"
2,It worked for the first couple of days,"This product worked for the first couple of days. The first few sprays distracted my lab enough, she would try to figure out where it came from, which caused her to forget what she was barking at. However, she began to get used to it and eventually she would bark over it. We wondered if the battery or spray ran out, but it worked just fine. We would watch her bark amidst a cloud of citronella spray! So if you have a stubborn or defiant dog, I'm sure the effect of the spray will wear off rather quickly and they will just ignore it. In fact, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. We have since tried the PetSafe PBC-102 No-Bark Collar which worked great. She stopped barking the first time and will never bark when the collar is on her."
5,Amazing results,"This collar works so well for my dog that she has gone from being a serial barker to not barking at all. The only bad thing is that she must wear the collar all the time. I read the other reviews and the biggest problem others had was battery life. I haven't yet had to replace the battery, all you have to do is remember to turn the device off. I refill the citronella after each use too. This collar was worth every penny...I wish I could sneak one on my neighbors dog!"
3,sometimeish,"It seems to do its job at times, but other time its like my dog is totally oblivious to the fact that she's being sprayed when she barks. So I'm really on the fence with this one. I still keep in on her though cause sometimes is better than no times at all."
1,Does not stop barking,"Collar seems to work like it is suppose to but the dog, german shep, could care less about getting sprayed. Going to pay the money and get a good shock collar. Was hoping this would work but figured it would not. Waste of money."
1,I didn't recieve my two collars yet BUT did recieve the extry spray and the extra batteries I had ordered a week or so ago,Please check into this problem I seem to be having I have the extra batteries and the extra spray I had ordered BUT no collars yet. My phone # is (908)400-4467 please contact meBonnie Sudnik
2,Hope Springs Eternally,We did n ot use the product. Our dog has limited her barking lately without any product.So may we return it and if so how?
1,Sucks for lil dogs,My dog completely disregarded the citronella smell from day 1... Plus I'm pretty sure there are no returns . It sounds like this collar works for some people but then eventually dogs just stop caring. I wouldn't reccomend!
5,Only took one time!!!! Excellent!!,"I definitely recommend this product! I have an 18 lb matipoo that excessively barked inside. The first time he had it on he barked and was sprayed. It startled him, but did not harm him. He got sprayed one more time the first day and that was it!!!! Now i dont even have to turn it on when i put the collar on. He does still bark if the collar isnt on so i put it on when i dont want him to bark. It is a little bulky for a small dog, but he doesnt have it on all day and night."
4,"Wow, this works good!",I used this on an 8 yr old Australian Shepherd rescue. She used to bark non-stop at the vacuum. A few times using this and she now goes to lay down when the vaccum comes out. Very pleased!
1,very disapointed,"I bought this in the hopes it would help with the barking problem, however with in one week of using this product it just stopped working!!!!! I changed the battery refilled the chamber and nothing!!! It is a big piece of crap I would not recommed it to anybody. I could not send it back because I threw every thing away that it was packed in, because I had heard such good things about it.It worked for about a week and I thought I was onto something good, was I fooled for the money I am very dosapointed !!! Don't waste your money it jams up and wont spray so what good is that?"
1,Worked for 10 minutes- now can't return it!!,"Got this for our old Golden Retriever. When I first put it on him and he barked, I could see that it worked- his eyes closed and he shook his head. A minute later he went to bark and he caught himself- I was so happy! Well, about ten minutes later he just barked and barked like it wasn't even on. So, I trimmed his fur all around that area, refilled the can, and ..... Nothing. He just didn't care that the smell came out, I guess, and I think he realized that if he barks a lot for a minute, then it's not a problem anymore.Ok, so I figured it must just work better on smaller dogs, and I can return it. NOPE, can't return it. 'Hazardous materials' can't be returned- they won't even take back the collar, without the extra refill cans of spray I shouldn't have ordered.So there's about $50 down the drain- for nothing. SO disappointed with Amazon, and Innotek company, right now."
5,Innotek Anti-Bark Collar really works!,"Excellent product. Our dog has only barked three times (with the collar activated) in the last two weeks since we got the collar. The only minor problem is that the adjustment band keeps slipping and the collar has to be retightened. However, it is doing the job."
1,one quiet day,"Well, I thought I would try it since nothing else has worked. When I saw the package with a Westie on it I had high hopes since that is the breed of my little noise maker. The first day she barked a few times and seemed to be pretty quiet. Now I think maybe there was just nothing to bark at that day. After 2 days she has figured out that it is just a spray and it runs out pretty quick so it is like a big joke to her now. On the plus side, I think it might work as a great mosquito repellant for our yard in the summer."
1,Did not work at all,"I have a young Blue Tick hound and it did absolutely nothing to control any barking...just kinda confused him at first, then after that he really didn't care. Had to get a shock collar which worked beautifully. No more police at my door or angry neighbors."
5,Stops barking,"I bought one to test it out because I was skeptical that it would work on my schnauzer and the price was a little higher than other citronella collars. My dogs will bark at anything and everything, so much so my neighbors complain. I put it on one of the dogs and the first time he barked it stopped him in his tracks. It makes a loud spray and the noise combined with the squirt startles the dog and he forgets why he was barking in the first place. He had it on for less than one day and gave up on trying to bark at things. After seeing the results I bought a second one for my other dog. Now it's nothing but peace and quiet, they still make noise but it is so quiet you can barely hear it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,The spray box kept on flipping over thereby defeating the whole purpose of having the collar in the first place. It would just spray downward and my dog would just keep barking. Really awful design. I followed the directions and it still would flip over and just annoy me. Buy another brand or another type of collar. This design is completely useless!
1,Completely Useless,"We have a Yorkie and thought we'd give this collar a shot as she has a tendency to bark when we leave our home. We wanted to try a non-shock method and figured why not give the Innotek collar a shot. We put the collar on and pretended to leave, sure enough she began to bark. It sprayed once, she stopped for about 2 seconds, and went right back to barking while the collar emptied its cartridge to no avail.Save your money, don't buy this thing."
1,Innotek Anti-Bark Spray collare- citronella,"Very disappointed. I cannot get this to work no matter how much my dog cries and barks!! She has long hair, I cut it on her neck just so it wouldn't interfere but still nothing!! I barked into it myself to see if the unit was working, and it did work on me!!!However, it's the DOG I want it for!! I'm feeling $40.00 poorer with nothing to show for it. I had high hopes!!"
2,Did not work for Pom,"I bought this anti-bark product because I have a rescued 6.5 pound Pomeranian who is scared of my husband and barks at him. She was previously abused by a guy and has some fear issues.This was very big and heavy for her. Even after cutting the collar part to fit her neck, the bark box protrudes way out. It did not stop her barking and actually made her fear worse. She was scared to go in or out of her dog door with it on. It hit her door the first time she went out, and scared her. I had to let her in and out, defeating the purpose of having a dog door.It did spray out nicely when she barked and the Citronella made her smell nice, but the collar is now sitting in a closet.I would not recommend ths for a small or fearful dog."
2,Didn't last long,"Multivet Gentle Spray Citronella Anti-Bark CollarThis collar worked fine, in fact better than the shock collar. One does have to refill it often and test it every day. Mine died after about four months, though.At that point I switched to dousing my little dog (who lives inside but goes out to potty and play with my other two dogs) in the face with a full glass of water when he barked (it was summer; I wouldn't do this in cold weather). I said ""quiet"" as I did it. After the first time he was quiet for a few days then tried barking again. In a week I had to douse him about 4 times. Since then he goes weeks without barking and an occasional reminder keeps him in line. He's way to agile to be hit by the water now, but the fact that I toss it in his direction convinces him to be quiet again. Every dog is different, but you might try that."
3,Anti bark,This helped stop the small dog from barking but not our large dog but that's ok as the small dog is the instigator.
3,Did not deter my little barker,For the 1st day it worked ...then Flo my Jack Russell decide to just keep barking until the unit was empty...she did this repeatedly...so in the end she is too smart for the machine...I kept trying it on occasiion and after 3-4 days it stopped working
3,Some dogs are too smart for this product,"This is potentially an amazing product - potentially eliminating the need to zap your dog with an electric shock. However, apparently my dog outsmarted the collar because she quickly learned that if she continued barking, even if she was sprayed, eventually (after about 20 sprays) the fluid container runs out of spray and she can continue to bark without any side effects at all. Sadly, that's what she did, so I am still searching for another solution to her separation anxiety - which is just about the only time she barks.Also, it is worth noting that Amazon does not permit a return on this item, even if it doesn't work - and that should have been mentioned when purchasing the collar. So now I have a collar that cost me $40 and is basically useless."
5,Works great!,"I love these bark collars. They just shoot out a spray when the dog barks instead of giving them a nasty shock. If your dog is super crazy about barking at stuff, maybe this won't work and it will bark anyway. But it has always worked great for my Cairn Terrier.Just remember to turn it off when not in use to conserve the battery. I keep one in my car for when I need it and one in the house. Great product!"
4,"Good product, smart dog.","We have Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and they are extremely smart dogs. This worked really great while it was on. But as soon as you take it off, the barking starts back up. Sometimes I leave it on and turn it off, but as soon as they bark once they realize that they can bark. Been using it for about 3 months. Battery is still going strong. I'm still on my first can of spray.My only complaint would be the adjusting part of the collar seems really loose, and I am constantly having to tighten it back up. Other than that a good product. Not jumping up and down, but it does work most of the time."
1,Broken upon opening,"I took it out of the package and put it on my dog and it didn't spray. I changed the battery and checked to make sure I had filled it properly and everything was fine, it just didn't work."
5,Very Happy,"We have a puppy that is just over 1 year old and she definitely has a barking problem...or I should say ""had."" I looked at these for some time and was not very confident that they would work. I was shocked to see that our puppy figured it out almost over night. She will still sometimes bark, gets sprayed and then she stops. We've started leaving it on her and turning it off and she doesn't know the difference.I am not sure if it is related to the collar or not, but she has been much more obedient since we got the collar."
4,It commands respect!!,"I bought this for my not quite year old Yorkie mix....he barked constantly at our cats and, since we live in a double, it wasn't the greatest way to keep on good terms with the neighbors. First time he wore it and barked - stopped dead in his tracks and looked at me as if to say ""What the heck???"" A few more barks and he figured that he better stop the barking. It has long since run out of juice and battery power, but if I put it on him he doesn't risk barking. All I really have to do is hold it up and SHOW him the collar, and he stops. Love it, love it, love it."
1,Doesn't work a lick for howlers!,"I had high hopes for this, for our barker-howler. It surprised her, but she really could care less if the stuff sprays in her face. Empties quickly too. Very disappointed, but I wanted to try this more humane idea before we use our tried and trusty ""zap"" de-barking collar. Now that works!"
1,Do not bother,"This was a ""gift"" for my mother's barky spaniel. The collar simply did not work, and because it is considered a ""hazardous"" material, Amazon put the kybosh on my desire to return it. Not worth the money."
3,No bark irritated Maltese eyes,"Although this is indeed a good idea and no doubt a great solution for some, after using it once on my little Maltese, it irritated his eyes. Probably for small dogs just a water spray might do. However, this product requires special loading."
3,"sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't","I recently moved into a house where the front yard is fenced and my dog will run and bark at people as they walk by. Being 12 yrs old I didn't want to shock him, so I tried the spray. 1 or 2 barks and he stops. But it sprays at the smallest sound, even when he is enjoying himself and rolling in the grass he gets sprayed. So I have to take it off, than of course he barks at something when I don't have it on. and you can't leave it on all the time. But if he and the neighbors dog are at each other at the fence,the spray is not aggresive enough to stop him. So,, it stops him from barking at people, but not dogs"
4,Citronella collar,"Wonderful product. Took only three times til my dog got the message. Now, all I have to do is show her the collar and she doesnt bark!"
4,This should be your first plan of attack for barky dogs!,"I bought two.Spray product worked like a charm to stop my AussieShep/Mix from barking. Still using it 7 months later. It's a godsend.It worked for a few months to stop my bulldog/mix's barking, but he wised up and realized a little spray in the face was no big deal. Now he barks right through it.This product works...but it depends on whether you have a stubborn dog or not. I'm going to try a buzz collar for the bulldog but definitely keeping this spray collar for the AussieShep.I would really recommend the spray collar as a first line of attack though. It's not as expensive as some buzz/static collars and it's very humane and easy to use. Have not had to change batteries yet after 7 months.The only bad thing: sometimes it sprayed when the dog shook. Loosening the collar a bit so the dog could shake while the collar hung down helps. It still goes off when the dog barks...it doesn't have to be extremely tight on the neck."
2,Works...but very poorly made; only last 2 days,"Purchased this product to put on our lab who loves to bark at anything and everything! Within two - three sprays, he realized what was happening and stopped barking. It, of course, does not stop them from whining because that doesn't trigger a spray. Unfortunatley, the product is so cheaply made that (as mentioned in other reviews) the collar adjustment does not stay so the collar either falls off or becomes loose enough for the dog to chew. Our dog chewed right through the collar by the third day (he hated being sprayed) and then when we went to put it on another collar, the plastic on the side of the sprayer broke and now it is useless. I will not purchase another product from this company due to their lack of quality workmanship."
2,beware the return policy!,"I thought this looked like a great product and read all the glowing reviews, even went to the manufacturers website to look at others. When I received the product I had to cut open the plastic package to find the directions for use and found that my dog could not wear another collar while wearing the no-bark collar AND that he could not be on a leash while wearing this collar. Deciding that it is not practical for us I attempted to return- To my great surprise it is not returnable!! Nowhere did I find information that this is considered a ""hazardous"" product! So even though I never removed the collar or the spray from the plastic I am sitting with $40 of a product I can't use. :-("
4,"So sorry I DID receive this item, it was for the citronella bark collar, and not the nail grinder","I am very sorry, I wrote a review on the wrong item. I did receive the citronella collar, and have used them in the past and like them very much. They work well, but had also ordered another item, and it has not arrived (not even from this company) very sorry for the mix up."
2,it's ok....,"i wouldn't buy/read this again. get, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by dr. henrietta mears. it's much much better."
1,Needs a better layout,"Every major city is on the spiral, which makes it difficult to read the highway names around the city. Also, the detailed views of the major cities didn't show enough of the surrounding area. Many city maps had only 2-3 highways shown, with no other details."
5,"Latin, Arabian, Byzantine, and Jewish points of view","Collaboratively compiled and expertly edited by S. J. Allen (Department of History and Political Science, Hood College, Frederick, Maryland) and Emilie Amt (Hildegarde Pilgram Professor of History, Hood College, Frederick, Maryland), The Crusades: A Reader is a comprehensive, 430-page selection of translated sources ranging in content from the eleventh to the early sixteenth centuries. From Christian and Muslim theories of just warfare; to the logistics of the Crusades; and perspectives on historical events from Latin, Arabian, Byzantine, and Jewish points of view, The Crusades: A Reader is a welcome and scholarly addition to European Historical Studies academic library reference collections and supplemental reading lists."
3,Needs better explanation,"It was alright, however, I was disappointed. Expected better explanation on such topics as: loading and unloading, getting into the attack position, braking, corners, getting over obstacles etc. The location is beautiful, but the presentation and tips need work and too general. If one wants good tips I recommend the following book: Mastering Mountain Bike Skills (I hope they make a video)."
5,Excellent early Fritz Langs,"Both very fine films, and 'M' is indeed the 100-minute version, not the 75-minute version listed on the case, so that's a bonus - and the film quality is fine, too. As for the cartoon, is it there ecause of the name Fritz, or to replicate some old-fashioned double-feature-with-cartoon experience? I don't know, but the films are wonderful. Peter Lorre is amazing."
2,"Emma, not forgotten","Emma Curtis Hopkins continues to be a force in the New Thought Movement whether she is known or unknown to most New Thoughters. While there is some useful information, this book is mainly a consolidation of existing scholarship in one source. There is nothing new here save some letters sparsely quoted. It does not seem that she had full access to the Fillmore or the Eddy correspondances. The authors interesting conclusions often indicate her lack of a strong grasp on Ms Hopkins teachings. We look forward to the day when a gifted writer comes along who can due justice to this great teacher."
3,Tivoli Radio Combo,"Was very happy with the vendor. Box was packaged really well and secure.Am a little disappointed with the sound of the system. It's not nearly as full as I had hoped. The bass is deficient and I think the subwoofer add-on would probably help. I'm thinking about buying one, but that's just one more thing to buy to make it sound better."
5,"Romantic, in a way.","I love this seris of ""Once Upon a Time. And I can't wait until I get the other one. Anyway, Jess and Lizz spend the summer as au pairs for a royal family! Jess is thrilled. A gaurded castle, a royal ball, complete with a prince. Not to mention, on the way, Jess meets this guy named Jacques, and instantly fall in love with him. And Lizz adores her young charges, but the only problem child is Pierre, a six-year-old who loves to hide from her. While trying to find Pierre one day, she gets lost in a topiary maze on the castle grounds. And she discovers something at the end of the maze just might turn her wildest fantsaies into reality!"
5,Jess and Liz=Royalty?,"Jessica and Elizabeth go to be au pair's to French queen and king. Jess is swept off her feet by a charming duke. But will she be swept under by him too? Elizabeth has forgotten all about Todd and his breaking up with her, kinda! She has fallin' for a Prince. But can she live up to his royal standards"
4,Once Upon A Time...,"First of all, I thought that this was a really good book. But there are a couple of problems-I mean, who really falls in love the first thing when they arrive in another country? And not just ONE twin does it-both do! It is easy to tell what is going to happen just by reading the back cover, but there are some unexpected surprises along the way too! This is really good, and I truly recommend it!"
2,UN-AMERICAN,"This was probably the most boring movie I have ever seen. The plot was not bad but the way it was put together was. If they had made it a ""feel good"" happy ending or a ""that was so sad"" story it would have had a better response. I was very disappointed. This film could have been much better. And that was the saddest ending of all."
1,Seriously Bad,"This is the slowest, most predictable movie ever. Though it has a couple of redeeming features, the acting is okay, and the cinematography was okay, the incredibly dull story line that pretty much goes no where interesting unfortunately smothers anything that was good about this movie. I watched the clock the whole movie, and then washed the dishes, which was a heck of a lot more fun."
2,dead kong,My little beagle/bassett mix destroyed this toy in less then 15 minutesit was great fun to play with for a lil bit but as soon as we stopped the play she chewed it to bits with no trouble at all. ill stick with the black extreem kong line from now on. its the only one she hasn't killed yet its 5 years old and still only just showing wear.
5,GORGEOUS license plate frame,This is literally a really gorgeous license plate frame. Its colors are vibrant and it's chrome background just makes everything pop! The letters are also elevated too to make it stand out more. I got this for my friend who just got a new car and is an AU alumni. She's going to love it!
2,overrated but probably good for designers,"I didn't finish this book because it was too boring. There were some interesting things (like examples of how memory can go wrong) but the infamous door handle example gets brought up over and over and over again. Jesus, I know there must be more things equally as/more interesting to talk about, please stop with the doors already. I would have preferred more cognitive science and less design manifesto (""design is important, design is important, design is important, blah blah blah""). I would have given it one star but I can see how it might be good for designers who are not very smart."
5,Vey fast delivery very prompt service,very nice delivery very fast response. One of the best sellers at amazon.will do business any time with them.
2,This book needed a subtitle,"The subtitle for this book should have been petty whining about mundane issues. If you are the type of person who always complains that they are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter, then you will love this book. The author evidently has too much time on his hands and has nothing more illuminating to write about than to find fault with, and endlessly complain about, the most trivial design issues. Light switches that don't line up with lights, stove top controls that don't line up, etc., etc. This book is neither interesting nor insightful. There is a definite lack of imagination at work (sadly, considering this is a book about design) which keeps the author from being able to appreciate simplicity and display creativity.This book was recommended to me, but I definitely cannot do the same."
1,Anything but useful information,"After reading so many wonderful reviews, and as a graphic / web designer myself, I expected lots of useful information. Unfortunately it was mainly hundreds of boring everyday experiences, complaints, moaning... and showing us how much this guy travels, how important he is and how everybody is amazed at his ""deep"" observations. For the reader, there is nothing useful whatsoever, no matter if you are a graphic designer, an industrial designer or a housewife."
1,wanderings of a non-structured mind,"does not live up to the hype, no wonder he works with Jakob Nielsen, same thinking ""structures"" erm. nice idea seeds, would fit into a four pager, even with examples.don't buy this book, the seven bullet items summarize all included. much awrite about nothing."
3,"Many good points, albeit slow","This book has many points on good design and makes me wonder how on Earth we can have so many examples of bad design. The book has many anecdotes that break up the monotony, but they don't last long. I find that even with all its very good points and humor it is still extremely slow to read and is quite repetitive. Still, I find myself looking at things differently now. I am now looking at object's design more and more and thinking how it could be improved or why it is good in the first place. Many of the good points of the book are also common sense ideas, but sometimes overlooked. The Design of Everday Things unfortunately tries to put these simple ideas into more technical words and thoughts than they should be, and I wonder if this book in itself is really an example of good design or bad design."
3,good bathroom read...,"so-so book..seems dated (esp. the last bits about computers...) good core ideas, but could have been compressed into an essay for harpers..."
2,Great Review of European Design Encounters,"A supposely much heralded book filled with various reviews of The Design Encounters of Doctor Norman on his Fabulous Trip to England. In other words, if you'd like some nice design theories subsumed by a psychologist's frequent travel references, then this is book for you. In all honesty, Dr. Norman had some nice ideas, but listening to him drone on about his trip to Cambridge was tiring."
3,good book but gets monotonous down the road,This is one of the classics. Many Human Computer Interaction (HCI) courses use this book as a reference. It is a good book it starts off well and gives excellent insights. But after a while it is the same stories over and over again - to a point that it gets quiet monotonous. Nevertheless if you choose to read only one book on HCI then this should be the one.
4,Helpful for any Field of Design,"As a game designer, I approached this book with an open mind, not knowing if I could pick anything up from it. It surprised me though. Although the book was written in 1987 and could use an updated version, the design principles stated there remain relevant up to today, even in a field that had been rarely touched upon when that book was written. (Yes, it does talk about games, but only in terms of difficulty level, and only pertaining to D&D.;) In particular, the game designer could look at the Seven Stages of Action to see if her game is performing up to par on the usability front.You might not find anything here that is imemediately useful in your design work, but all designers worth their salt should broaden their horizons and continuously search for things, both new and old to be able to use in their craft."
5,A philosophy rather than specific guidelines,"In general, computer software is abominably designed. But I find most books on user interface design frustrating: they assume that if the designer just follows certain specific rules, the product will automatically be ""user-friendly."" It doesn't work that way, folks: even if your menus are short and your use of color is discreet, the product may still be utterly unusable.Norman puts the focus right where it belongs: on the USER. What is this person trying to do with the product? What is his/her level of knowledge? How can the design of the product facilitate what the user wants to do, instead of getting in the way? This is a philosophy of design, rather than a set of rules. But the software designer (or any designer) who absorbs this philosophy will turn out far better products than someone who merely buys a book of rules and follows them blindly."
5,Wonderful and Interesting Book,"I'll make this quick. Even though this book was read for a college class, I actually enjoyed reading it. The examples were straight out of everyday life, as promised, and they were very interesting to learn about. This is a book that truly makes one think and changes one's perspective on the world."
2,"Not Very Interesting, Not Very Insightful","While not completely un-readable, don't expect any ""a-ha!"" moments from this book. When analyzed enough, nothing makes sense. Why am I typing this review on a keyboard with my fingers instead of on a hovercard with my nose? The first few pages are interesting, then the book gets just plain tiring."
5,Great book!,Fascinating. Can't wait to learn more about Norman's ideas. Helpful for anyone working in a creative (or any) field. Will change the way you look at everyday objects.
3,A little disappointing on Kindle,This book has several very important pictures that show product design trade offs in real life. In the Kindle version these pictures are incomprehensible. They are too small and can't be resized. A lot of the value of this book is lost because of the unavailability of the pictures.Amazon could solve this problem by making the illustrations available online.
4,Great book even if you are not in Human Factors engineering,"I had to read this book for a course. However once I started it, I wanted to read it. All those oddball things like pushing the wrong side of doors, not knowing whether to push or pull, that we all do and blame ourselves, are not our fault. Something in the design led to our incorrect behavior. This is a fundamental concept of Human Factors and Don Norman captured it perfectly. A must read for Human Factors engineers and an interesting read for the rest of the world. I'm buying more of his books."
5,Simple Natural Design Wins,I love this book -- it shows how natural simple designs always win in the end.It gives great examples of good and horrible designs.
5,Required Reading for Everyone,"This book rocks. Seriously, I think it should be required reading by all. It helps one to start to think empathically in how their design or actions could be perceived by others. A+"
4,"A Little Dated, but Still Insightful","Written by a Usability Guru, some of the examples are a little dated, but still valuable for today's usability issues. A good read and well written."
5,"For Inventors, Tinkerers and Software Designers, No Better Book Available","If you have a creative side, and intend to design or invent new products and services, you will find this book provides a well-tempered analysis of technological devices and their impact on the people who will ultimately use them.I've read three of Norman's books on the subject, and this was my favorite."
3,Design? Not really...,"I understand this book used to be titled ""The Pyschology of..."", and that would be a more accurate title. Overall it's fairly interesting but rather dated, and would be of more use to a product designer than a web person like myself. Still, definitly worth a look if you've got a spare minute."
1,Lightweight,"I was expecting a more thorough and chock-full-of-good design examples text. As the author states, he changed the title from ""Psychology of ..."" to ""Design of"" - the former is more accurate and indicative of content. The examples presented are lightweight, and the process of design is not really addressed - just some obvious rules of thumb are presented. A very basic primer at best, and waste of time for anyone other than the most novice designers."
2,a great (if aging) read,"a great book for anyone in the business of product or interface design. tends to go on about things a little bit too much, but is a must for your designers bookshelf."
1,This book needs a redesign,"I gave up about halfway through and just about threw it in the lake, but it was a library book. The endnotes were utterly unuseable. Half of the notes were very interesting digressions and the other half were citations, but I couldn't tell which was which until I had spent three minutes flipping pages. And yes, it took three minutes to find the proper endnote. Every chapter's notes are numbered beginning with 1, so I frequently ended up on the right note number, but the wrong chapter. Even if you remember which chapter you were on by the time you flip back to the notes section, you can't always tell which chapter the notes are for; each chapters-worth of notes is labeled only on the first page, and they tend to be several pages long. Until the good Dr. Norman sees fit to reissue the book in a readable format, don't waste your time."
3,"Fabulous idea, poorly executed.","I was really looking forward to reading this book, having been told what it was about, the design of everyday things and how we all relate to it, but was let down when it arrived. The content is a fascinating one - the way the book is designed on the other hand leaves a whole lot to be desired! How could Donald Norman talk about design and not extend it to the design of his book? I am baffled! No attention was paid to the design of the book it seems. So much of the images/examples have gone past their sell by date. I think that it could use an update. Shouldn't judge a book by it's cover but when the content is about design, I'm only exhibiting consumer behavior relative to design as discussed in the book!"
3,Review of The Design of Everyday Things,"The books makes some interesting points and is well worth reading. However, the presentation seems to me rather too enthusiastic. I feel a more considered approach may have been better for the subject. The content is also rather dated now. Many of the pictures seem poor quality and not always very helpful.I have one specific criticism and this causes me to wonder about the relevance of some of the other points made in the book. A picture of a sound mixing desk is shown as an example of a poorly designed product. Actually all the mixing desks I have come across have been quite well-designed for their purpose. If he considers mixing desks so bad a design, perhaps the author should be challenged to come up with a better one.In summary, this is an interesting book, but not the great book the hype would have you believe."
2,"Outdated, better books available","This book is a classic in the sense that it was once groundbreaking, in that it pointed out obvious flaws in industrial and software design. However, a lack of any updates outside of a new introduction leaves the book stale and dated. Complaints about the design of 1980s DOS software and VCRs is now of only historical interest."
3,nice but a bit dated,"a nice book, too bad the author did not keep the original title, but i understand it would have scared people off ;-). However some of the examples show their age, it could undergo a revision."
2,Tedious Read,"Not exactly a page turner, it took me several months to get through this book. I enjoyed the content but the delivery was excruciating at times. Ultimately it was too textbooky for my liking. If you are looking for something that is engaging (a la anything by Malcolm Gladwell), look elsewhere."
2,Narrow view on the subject,"The book is about proper design of door handles and appliance switches. Door handles should suggest by their size, shape and position if the door should be pushed, pulled or slided. The arrangement of switches should resemble the arrangement of the device, so that the right switch can be found easily. These would be two great introductory examples into the subject of easy-to-use design. But the book stays there and does not go anywhere further. This message could be conveyed in two pages instead of 257. I would expect suggestions about gathering user requirements and turning them into good design or applying intuitive design techniques to user interfaces of computer programs. Also, I think that most inconvenient designs that we encounter in everyday life that cost us a lot of time are poorly designed procedures rather than things themselves. Even though the title of the book includes ""things"", it could go into applying easy-to-use design principles into procedures."
2,"Design Expert, Heal Thyself!","Great ideas from an iconoclastic psychologist. Unfortunately, rendered in a design that is more than unusable--it is hostile to the reader. The book is almost a parody of the ideas it attempts to communicate. I'd blame the editor, except that Dr. Norman should have known better himself."
4,Ever wonder...,"If you've ever wondered how things come into being and concepts behind them? Then this book is for you. For me, it aided me by gaining a better understanding into what sort of concepts I should be working through in forming my presentations for work."
3,Good Info but needs a rewrite,This book contains some good information but needs to be rewritten making it more to the point. It also needs more clear definitions of what it is talking about. It sure did seem to go on and on about things that I think about all the time anyway. Sure does not deserve a 5 rating and a 3 damns it too much so finally I end up with a 4 that seems a bit too high... 3.5 would be fair.
1,Not Thrilled,The author and book both show their age when he complains over and over about his inability to operate a VCR or slide projector.The ramblings go on and on with very little practical design instruction.I got the kindle version of this book which was very low quality-- the pictures showed up in very odd locations.I was very happy Amazon refunded me.
4,A New Perspective for Designers of Anything,"Donald Norman provides a new and interesting perspective to the design of ordinary objects. His title sums up the topic of his book perfectly. Throughout the book, Norman provides examples of objects that are either poorly designed or well designed. He makes us think about not only the objects in his book but also about objects we come across everyday. After reading this book, I found myself analyzing the design of ordinary items all the time. I recommend this book for anyone who is designing or inventing anything. The book is an easy read and appropriate for a wide range of audiences."
3,Important concepts presented in less than ideal manner,"This is a difficult book to evaluate and recommend to others. It's full of incredibly useful design concepts. But the concepts are abstract and may be difficult for some to apply to software design (e.g., affordances, conceptual models, mapping). It's written by one of the world authorities in usable design, Donald Norman. However, Norman's writing style alternates between the dry description of the concepts and the more interesting real-word examples of those concepts. But, most of the the real-world concepts presented throughout the book are not software-based (e.g., telephones, doors, appliances). However, all of the concepts are incredibly important to the design of usable software. In the end, if you can make it through the book and can see the application of these proven design concepts to your software efforts, then it will have been worthwhile."
1,Too stiff and hard to read,"I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to have too stiff and academic a tone, which hindered rather than helped reading it. You require a good amount of determination to finish this book. I ended up giving up and giving away the book to a friend, having learnt little."
3,good gift for the designer in your life,"Although on his wish list, it was not exactly what he thought it was when he got it. More of a detailed description would be helpful"
3,"Great book, yet it strt to show some signs of age","I have read half of it, it is exactly what I expected. I mean it is fullfilling my objectives. I think this is a great masterpiece for people trying to figure out what this world should be build around what.It become even better if you don't swallow it without chewing it. Tons of things where thought in the 80s so it is fun to disassemble the book too."
2,A major disappointment,"I found this book to be a major disappointment. The author does have a collection of anecdotes about poorly designed items he's encountered but the constant whining gets tiresome very quickly. He then promised to offer some insights into how to get the design process right but never quite managed. The best he could come up with was these four bullet points:* make it easy to see what's possible* make it easy to see what's not possible* make it easy to see what happened* make the mapping between action and effect obviousEven if you do find those points insightful, you'll find that beyond examples of when those points are violated, there is precious little useful advice on how to achieve these things.The physical book itself was hardly a model of good design. The margins were far too narrow with some headings disappearing completely into the binding area and random paragraphs were set in italics for no apparent reason."
1,non-helpful,"I thought this would have been a good biography, but it gave me absolutely nothing. Doesn't even tell you her birthday. This is not a biography, it's a bit of information you could have gotten off any other website. This was a waste of money and time."
4,Great collection except for the one defective book.,"My girls received this for Christmas last year and still enjoy these books today. And now that they're almost three they use them to ""practice"" reading. Because they know the rhymes so well it makes great fun. The illustrations are so sweet, too. Really a great gift for new babies, first birthday, or for Christmas. My only problem with our set is that the ""Hey, Diddle, Diddle"" book was misprinted. It has 2 of the same pages and leaves off the last page, ""...and the dish ran away with the spoon."" Not too impressed with that--makes things a little confusing."
4,The arrival of Mother Goose,Mother Goose' first arrival was a distinct disappointment as the package was badly damaged in transit. However a replacement was winged to us immediatley so no more tears were shed.The books are delightful and well worth buying. My only complaint is that the books are difficult to extract from the box due to the shortness of the rope ties.The entertainment value however is immense and we shall be looking at this author in more detail to decide what next to buy.
3,For Interior Decoration Only...,"I bought this book expecting to learn more about bamboo construction techniques. Sadly, I've learned more on the internet. There was no discussion of how to select or cure bamboo culms, and the most detailed instructions were reserved for ornamental, interior objects, rather than utilitarian, external objects.If I'd paid full price, I'd only give this book 2 stars. But I bought it used, so it's worth 3 stars, barely."
1,i sent it back,This book was a serious disappointment. Definitely search elsewhere if you want to build with bamboo.
4,Very Enjoyable,This book gave me ideas on what to look for and how to enjoy my trip with less stress. Thank you very much Rick!
5,excellent introduction to selective mutism,"As a parent of twins with Selective Mutism, I loan this book to the teacher every year to introduce SM. This book presents SM in a manner easy to understand and offers suggestions to ease anxiety. It has helped my children over come issues because the teacher understands what is going on."
2,The Ideal Classroom Setting for the Selectively Mute Child,"This ""book"" is more of a pamphlet with a big font. It is overpriced and most of the information in this book can be gained by researching the topic, selectively mute, on the internet. If you are a teacher, do not feel compelled to purchase this book. It's a waste of your hard earned money."
4,an enjoyable book,"This is not the best Jacqueline Thomas book, but it was still great. The characters are enjoyable and you can see the love forming between the couple. I love th fact that though Eric is a pastor, he was betrayed in a way that made you relate to him and just see him as a regular guy, but his love for God was so strong that you just have to love him. Some of the history aspect of the novel, I could have done without. Overall, its worth the time, but it doesnt fill you with emotion like some of the others"
5,Victorinox 3 peice set,Great cutlery. Cuts everything. Thin slices like the TV chefs. Highly recommended.
5,A great starter set,"This is my first set of ""real"" knives, and they are great! Very comfortable to grip and use, and they are super sharp. When they first arrived, my roommate ran his thumb over the edge of the chef's knife and expressed skepticism about its sharpness. So he picked up a piece of paper and sliced at it. The cut was quick and smooth. He was impressed. My experience cutting tomatoes--often a good test--has been the same.I had done a bunch of research before deciding on these knives. They are definitely a good buy, lots of value for the money. My only slight complaint (and it is really not much of one) is that they are advertised as dishwasher-safe, though hand washing is recommended. But when the set arrived, its instructions say specifically not dishwasher safe. It hasn't been a big deal. I wash the knives lovingly by hand."
5,sharpest knives ever,We've had umteen different sets of knives through the years. None have come close to these! Cuts through an uncooked potato like a hot knife through butter. I don't think anyone would be dissapointed buying these knives!
5,Great product at great price,I think these are the best knives for the money. Quality is fantastic. They come razor sharp and hold an edge. I highly recommend these knives!
5,GREAT Knives,These knives are awesome. I had to be really careful because i wasn't used to such sharp knives. I would recommend these.
4,Very sharp,Nice quality. I didn't know knife sizes very well when I ordered these. They are great knives- but the largest one is so big I rarely use it.
4,These are pretty good knives,"We have been using these knives for a few months now and they are pretty nice they are very sharp, cut very well and are holding their edge. There are a couple of drawbacks to them, I am not a proffessional by any means so this is just my opnion, the handle feels cheap like the stuff you buy to refinish a screwdriver or hammer handle. The other thing is chef knife seems too long by 1.5 to 2 inches it is what came in this package they probably offer a shorter one but I struggle with the length a litte, nothing I have cut needs ths long of a blade.I am not unhappy with the purchase they are nice but I also bought a Global G48 7-Inch Hollow-Ground Santoku and wish I had bought all Global knives instead of these the Global just had a better feel and balance."
4,Good value!,"Would have liked a nicer storage box or sleeves for the blades, but the knives are wonderful."
3,Very dusty,"I bought this as a gift for my mom. But was disappointed to see the knife set when I opened it for the first time. The knife set inside the amazon outer brown packaging was very very dusty. I had to clean the package as well as the individual knives. There were some scratches on the transparent plastic cover of the package. (I think this knife set was stored in a warehouse which is maintained poorly and not very clean)After cleaning the dust, the knives do look new. I cannot comment on other things as I have not used the knife.Thanks"
2,6 Months later,"I gave this to my ""chef"" husband for Christmas and he was thrilled. Unfortunately even though we took very good care of them they don't cut like they did just 6 months ago. Seems a little early to take a Steele to them to me but I guess that is what you get for the price. They are BADAXX when you first get them though. Oh and on the plus side I wrote Amazon because I wanted to write a review about the knives and they mistakenly thought I wanted to return them and would have let me because I am such a good customer! I LOVE AMAZON.COM!!They have the BEST Customer Service of anywhere I shop! Stick with Amazon but upgrade $$ on the knives!!"
2,A bit disappointing,"When I received these knives in the mail, I was disappointed by a few things. The blades did not feel weighted correctly. They felt way too light and therefore did not have a balance to them that we had sought out in knives previously. Also, I knew the description said 10"" for the chef's knife, but I did not expect the size still. It was huge. I don't know that I ever would have used it. My boyfriend went to buy different knives at Bed, Bath and Beyond and ended up with a 3 set of Henckley knives for the same price, which felt much better to hold. I cannot comment on the blades as I never used the knives."
5,Best knives ever,The Victorinox Fibrox knives are the best knives I have ever used. I love to cook and have spent a lot of money on 'good' knives before that just didn't measure up to the hype. I read all the reviews on these knives and didn't find any negatives. I thought I would give them a try. I am glad I did. These knives cut easily through foods. I would highly recommend them.
4,nice.,The knives are very sharp. So far i love them after a few weeks of use. Time will tell if they are worth the $. A case to store them in would have been nice. The seller was the only down part about this purchase. took over a month to get them.
3,Too big for my wife,"Bought these for my wife after seeing such good reviews online, but the handles were just too large for her to use comfortably. As a guy I had no problem handling each of them, and the non slip surface seemed comfortable and the knives well balanced. Be warned: the large knife in the set is 10 inches long, and that really is a BIG knife.We never got to use them, and I re-packaged and returned them - a simple no hassle process with return postage paid for by Amazon. (Another reason I prefer to buy from Amazon than any other online store) My 3 star product rating is as neutral as I could make it, given that the knives were never used, but they were not really suited to my wife's smaller hands."
4,good mainstream feature of Traci Lords,"Traci plays the wife of a thief who steals diamonds from a vicious mob. So she and her husband got between two fires of reckless mob-gangs. Her brother appears to be a weak and selfish person not worthy to be her brother. Traci shows a strong character soon to be a victim by turning to be a young widow. Without the help of a sympathetic cop she fights both gangs after losing the diamonds to one party. Traci's fight scenes are marvelous and her acting is reasonable. Her former acting abilities as a pornstar is compare to this absolutely far more better, not to mention she has reached the top as a horny, sexually marvelous and devlish queen of porn. But she deserves a chance to better her mainstream performance but only if she manage to have the best people around her. The picture shows Traci who has the talent to improve her dramatic abilities. Ice is a good feature film with good entertainment elements, surely for her fans!"
3,ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS OF OUR TIME,"While I have encountered many historical facts surrounding Churchill's leadership, this is actually the first biography I have read on the man. The book was informative and factual and made for enjoyable reading from a political standpoint; however, the book was primarily based on his acclaimed polital career rather than his personal life. It did touch briefly on his marriage and a few of his quirks and idiosyncrasies but did not provide detail on the psychological elements of the man or what really ""made him tick"" as an individual. Overall, the book is worth reading, and readers will no doubt agree that Churchill, as one of Britain's most infamous prime ministers, was considered in his day a man ahead of his time."
2,too much churchill,for a first time reader of churchill--this book was too muchthe style of writing is detailed to the point where i lost interestthe author obviously adores the man but this reader had to put it down several times and struggle to the end
3,Fascinating author and subject but ultimately unreadable,"A fascinating person writing about a fascinating person. Unfortunatrely, I found it unreadable. I tried for 8 weeks to finish it and made it over halfway but the ego of the writer kept bumping into the ego of the subject. It should have been 2 books- Book 1- ''Churchill''; Book 2- ''What Roy Jenkins really thinks about alot of things.'' I believe both books would have been fun reads, but not mixed together as here."
2,"Change titlle to ""Churchill's Parliamentary life""","If you are trying to get a round and complete view od Churchill's life, this is NOT the book. It is all about how Churchill is elected to the Parliament, his relationships with other MP, his speeches at the House of Commons, in summary there is not much insight into anything else.It is well written, strong British english, and I'd recommend it to anybody looking to learn the British Parliamentary system, similar to ""Johnson, The Master of the Senate"" book (American workings of the Senate), or if you have already read about Chruchill and want to get a deeper dive into his Parliamentary years, though, it is a long book."
1,Slapdash writing.,"I didn't finish this book. Jenkins just throws his note cards at the hapless reader. The editor was awol. Stick with Gilbert. Alternatively, start with Manchester's unfinished bio (to 1940) & then switch to Churchill's memoirs."
2,long winded and drawn out,"I read Roy Jenkins's biography of Churchill soon after Edmund Morris's The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Jenkins work did not compare. His writing was drawn out and labored, with extensive references to obscure members of the British aristocracy and long passages on parliamentary procedures. The author's constant reminder of his own career in parliament was an annoying distraction. The book's strongest section was the chapters on Churchill's wartime conferences with FDR and Stalin. I have always admired Churchill and I was looking for a well-written comprehensive biography. I am still searching for that book."
2,Churchill by Roy Jenkins,"We read this book for our book club. All members agreed that they did not enjoy ""Winston Churchill"" by Roy Jenkins. Besides being extremely long (900 pages!), members felt Jenkins focused on minutiae regarding Churchill's life while failing to convey why he was ""the greatest Prime Minister Britain ever had"", as the author repeatedly claimed. It concentrates on the details of political life, who said what, to whom and when, without discussing the impact of decisions taken. In addition, there is no discussion of what was happening in the world, ie, WWI, WWII, the fall of the British empire, rise of communism, etc."
5,Sir Winston As He Was,"We Americans tend to see Winston Churchill through the prism of a few months during the Battle of Britain when he stood alone in the world against the Nazis and fascism. As fascinating and dramatic as that period was, a full length biography of Winston Churchill gives the reader the proper context to appreciate Winston Churchill as the leading political figure of the 20th century. Roy Jenkins has authored an extraordinary book that only he as former M.P. and minister could write. The nuances of 10 Downing, Westminister, and Whitehall might elude other historians, but Jenkins knows all the slights and symbolisms of parliamentary politics. Jenkins concludes that Churchill was the greatest British prime minister of all. That's not an easy judgment from Labourite Jenkins who also wrote the award-winning biography of Gladstone. This book is a neccesary addition to the Churchill bookshelf."
2,poorly written biography,"Tediously written book with too much trivial detail about Churchill-- who he had dinner with ( and sometimes what he ate), where he took vacations and what hotels he liked-- and not enough fleshing out on his political philosophy and actions. The book also presumes too much knowledge about the times and about minor historic players and issues in Britain, so you are forced to research elsewhere the topic you are reading about. I did read the whole book but regret that I didn't stop earlier to find a better Churchill bio."
1,"It's not about content, sorry.","Your guidelines ask for reviewers to stick to content. I would be glad to follow your directive, but I couldn't read this book. I'm a biblioholic, reading two or more books a week (no, I'm not retired!), and had a thirty-year career teaching high school English. I guess that what did it. I marched painfully through twentysome pages and gave up. The prose in this tome requires a methodical reader who can stand to go back again and again to decode just what sentences might mean. I should have known on the very first page. ""But Churchill was emphatically not among them."" Just how is someone emphatically among others?"
3,Jenkin's Folly,"Roy Jenkins was not only a member of the opposition party (opposite to Churchill), a frustated old man, but most importantly a bigot who seeks to aggrandize himself with foolish footnotes and greedy references to his un-stellar parliamentary career, while criticizing the work of the great biographer - William Manchester.In my opinion, this was a difficult read because every so often Mr. Jenkins had to remind the reader of his personal connection to the Great Churchill. Save yourself the suffering, read William Manchester's Masterpieces, and pray that Manchester will be able to finish his third book on Churchill."
4,A good one-volume work to summarize Churchill's life,"With a person like Churchill, you can't imagine how you find new material to write about a celebrated life. I guess at this stage it's about style and what makes your biography slightly different than the many other books written about Churchill. This is a very readable book and you really get the feel the author gets into the head of Churchill. Of course there are lots of little interesting factoids about Churchill's life revealed as should be expected in 900+ pages. I also know that there is nothing like getting some ""aha"" moments when you thought you knew something about the subject and you find out you're wrong. I was quite surprised about Winston's upbringing. In summary, a very good book to expand and reinforce your knowledge about an amazing person."
2,"Difficult to read, and overwhelms with tedious detail.","I do agree with one reviewer, that this isn't an appropriate biography for ""first time"" Churchill students. I do know a hodgepodge of facts about Churchill, and have read some of his writings, but never ""had a go"" at a biography wholely dedicated to him. I'm sorry I selected this work for a starter. It is analagous to opening Pandora's box in regards to names, positions--details and more details which are impressive scholarship, but an extremely soupy read, frankly. Didn't enjoy it at all. Must be better biographies of Churchill!"
3,"Full of details, but no history","Jenkins is an engaging writer and quite familiar with Parliament, but he fails as a biographer because he concentrates only on Churchill and assumes the reader knows all the details of the history Churchill lived through. Compare this to William Manchester's superb Churchill biographies, The Last Lion parts 1 and 2. Manchester is a historian and grounds everything he writes in the history of the period. Oh, how much better Jenkins would have been had he done the same."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a big disappointment for me. It was a short, quick read that ended far too abruptly. I think I'm simply getting tired of this series. The Stephanie Plum character is loosing her charm for me. She does not seem to grow in any way and doesn't seem to want to. My main problem with this character is her indecisiveness. Joe or Ranger? Make a decision already! Actually, I think the decision is obvious. Does she really think there is a future with Ranger? I must admit, I am probably the only female that reads this series of books that is not that fond of the Ranger character as a romantic interest. Yes, he's ""mysterious and sexy"", that's all well and good, but what woman would want to seriously become involved with a man who seemingly has no interaction with his only child? I will admit, I never get tired of Lula and Grandma Mazur. Those characters are always a lot of fun and they provided a few laughs. It's just not enough to keep me interested anymore."
2,Not what up to snuff,"The ending leaves you flat, wondering, where do things leave Stephanie? Previous books have always ended with her and a man, whether you know which one it is or not, but this time it kind of just ends.I agree with many of the reviewers, I have always bought the book the first day it's released, and I feel cheated. Is Janet writing with someone else? Handing over the type-writer ribbon to a novice to get their ""finger's wet""? This just doesn't seem like Janet's writing. No funeral home was really visited, they live in the burg and they're going to Dunkin' Donuts? What about Barbero's or Italian People's?And what about Juniak? Is he no longer in the book for a reason?Overall I was disappointed, but I'll still buy the 11th book."
2,I expected more,"Frankly, this is probably the most poorly written Stephanie Plum novel in the series. The dialogue no longer feels authentic and many of the situations are just too over the top. The ending is thoroughly preposterous and feels as though Ms. Evanovich slapped it on because she had written enough. I agree with other reviewers that there is not enough interaction between Steph and Morelli or Ranger (Though I am happy to see more of Connie).Throughout my reading of the novel, I often wondered if Janet is even still writing these, or if they are some sort of team effort like her romance novel redux. I love the series, love Stephanie and the rest of the characters, but really didn't like this book. This added less to the series than the holiday novella--the characters really didn't grow at all."
3,Worst ending ever,"I've worked my way through all ten books in this series and enjoyed them all until this one. Even this one I could have enjoyed if the ending hadn't been so pathetic. It didn't even make sense! And is it really realistic that she is beaten and terrorized by a mob and then gets up and smiles and waves happily when the cops arrive. What happened to the real Stephanie who actually reacted like a human being to scary situations? Bring her back soon!And, always, more Ranger, please!"
3,Plum Loco,"You know, it's gotta be hard to sustain a character through ten installments. I suppose it can be done - look at the ""Alphabet"" series for evidence. But, in contrast, how many Harry Potters will we see?Steph is one in a million - we love her to death. I take her as a meaningful antidote to the Sopranos - a way to redeem my faith that wonderful hearts and great minds live in New Jersey. But in this book, she seems, well, less in command and more ditzy than I like to see her. I want her to grow and deepen, not end up seeming so lost somehow.Attitude? Still plenty. But she should be stronger..."
3,I beg to differ,"I'm in the middle of listening to this book on CD in the car, and C.J. Critt is driving me nuts once again!She's got just one excited, loud, irritating tone of voice, and it's not one you can bear to listen to very long. Though she enunciates clearly, everything is waaaay over the top, whether it's some important action she's narrating or just her food shopping list. A funny thing too is that the voice of boyfriend Joe has a different accent in this book than in an earlier one!It really puts me off the author, whom I think is very good. But I'd rather read the book than listen to this wildly exaggerated narration!"
5,Still giggling,This is one of the best of the Plum books. I just wish she would make up her mind between Morelli and Ranger.The humor in this one was by far one of the best. I don't think I will get tired of them. Keep em coming.
2,avoid this book if you're on a diet,"This was my first Stephanie Plum novel and it will probably be my last. I didn't think it was as funny as the author was intending. (could be a ""chick book"" thing?)And it constantly gave me junk food cravings that I thought I had conquered years ago. Especially the TastyKakes butterscotch krimpets.It gets 1 star because I did manage to get through it as I became used to the author's style and storytelling. But I could've/ should've missed this one."
2,"Same old, same old","While I enjoy Stephanie's adventures, they are becoming a bit tiresome. I debated about even reading her latest book because I was bored with the last two, but since they are a quick read decided to forge ahead. I agree with other reviews; Janet needs to move these characters along. Maybe Stephanie should explore a new career that is less dangerous that showcases her strong points. I think like all great TV shows, this series has about run its course."
4,A little disappointed...,"I ran out and bought my copy last night after work. I had read the on-line readings and was anticipating this book to be really excellent. I was a little disappointed and didn't think this was up to her usual books. She built up to a big ending and then it was almost like she got tired of writing it and just threw in something that would work.I think she's a terrific author and I'll keep reading her books. However, I am wondering if this character is about maxed out. How many more stories can there be about exploding cars and her inability to pick Morelli or Ranger?"
2,Enough already,First few books in the series were pretty hilarious but this is just more of the same. Boring!
1,Plum Ridiculous,"First, let me say that I LOVE Stephanie Plum! But this book was a big let-down. As fun as SP is, the plot for this novel just couldn't keep my attention. I mean, C'mon. There's a contract on her head, but she's running around shopping etc, as if she didn't have a care in the world. Totally implausible. But hey, if you need a book you can skim while tanning, then this is probably it. Buy it used. Better yet, check it out of the library. Save your $."
2,Save a Tree,"I have enjoyed the Stephanie Plum series. I have paperbacks 1-6 and glad I didn't waste a tree or two on 7-10. I'm tired of the car blow-ups-goop in the hair-donut stuffing-gun slinging-mishaps. It was interesting to see that Ranger actually slept in a bed rather than hang from his toes at the top of a cave. The series has become too monotonous and predictable.What the ""fudge"" kind of ending was that anyway?Snap...snap..."
4,good read,"Love the Plum series, always funny and entertaining. I actually LOL. Just one thing would make it better, if Stephanie would finally give into Ranger, the suspense is killing me."
3,Same ol same ol,"This one had real potential. There was an interesting plot introduced, but not developed. I like the gang related idea and the kidnapping. Lula had me laughing so hard I was in tears, but the ending was a major disappointment. It was like the air going out of a balloon. I finished the novel in just one afternoon, which was another disappointment. When you buy a hardcover book you want to be entertained for longer than a few hours. It was like a two minute romp in the hay. It got you all hot and bothered and left you wanting."
5,This was my favorite so far,"I really enjoyed how she actually became a detective and discovered what everyone was trying to find. I also enjoyed the fact that her friends and lover were their to defend her, especially Sally Sweet: he/she was awesome. This is the first book I shared with my mother who is an avid reader becaue I think it is Janet Evanovich's best.I hope she picks a man soon. I like Morelli for the long term although both men are providers and protectors. Morelli puts up with a lot form her and her family."
4,Ten Big Ones,"Great reading. Funny, action-packed and fast-paced. Loved it! Couldn't put it down. A real page-turner! One of my favorites in the Stephanie Plum series."
2,What happened to this series?,"Either Aliens came down, abducted Ms Evanovich, and replaced her with a clone who cannot write or, even worse, the series has run it's course and the author has grown bored with the characters and run out of creative thought. If you are a fan and, like me, have enthusiatically followed the exploits of Stephanie Plum, you will be sorely disapointed by this latest installment. Bottom line--it is pretty bad. Have only about 50 pages left and it will be a struggle just to finish. Plot is weak requiring the Author to spend endless amounts of time on nonsense filler that has nothing to do with the real story. Still, there are some funny parts to the story, you will chuckle here and there. But these times are few and do not make up for the largely poor story telling."
3,"Not as good as some of her others, but still worh reading.","It's pretty good throughout, but the ending was bla.I love some of her characters; my favorite, Grandma Mazur.By the way, I listen to the books on audio. The narrator does an incredible job with the voices of the characters."
2,Stephanie's relationships are stalled.,"I have been a Plum reader for years, the murder plots are great but the romance triangle is stalled. Since this is a big part of the story line would like to see Stephanie grow up alittle and make a decision. She needs to have confidence in herself. I think Stephanie has been working this job long enough to start to get her feet on the ground. She also needs to make a decision on which man. She needs to tangle with Ranger or marry Joe and settle down; even if it means the the end of the series."
5,Big Fun!,"Stephanie has annoyed a local gang and now a hit-man is hunting for her. She's trying to decide just what to do with the two men in her life, and deal with being in her sister's soon-to-be wedding. The icing on her cake is the funny little rolls of fat that seem to be oozing around the waistband of her jeans.Ten Big Ones is tons of fun!! Janet Evanovich is in prime form!"
3,Ten Big Ones,I enjoyed this book as I have all the others but I will admit to being disappointed with this one. The story was just okay (I thought it was going in a whole other direction with the Red Devil and was surprised when it turned out to be gangs). I also thought the publishers might have left some pages off the ending because I did look for them! I'll definitely keep reading Janet Evanovich's books but hope her future ones pick up the pace a little bit.PS I had preferred Morelli until this book. Now its Ranger all the way!!!!
2,A big disappointment...,"I have loved the Stephanie Plum novels from the beginning, and I'm always eager to read the next installment. But this one was really a disappointment. Stephanie has always been ditzy, however being ditzy is one thing -- being a total idiot is another. She really crossed over into stupidity this time. Plus, the love triangle is getting old, for god sakes pick a guy! I'm getting to the point where I feel sorry for Morelli and wish he'd just dump her since she keeps stringing him along. What guy would put up with all that crap? If you're a huge fan, and want to read it anyway, I'd recommend the library, or waiting for the paperback."
1,Ten Little Ones,"I love this series and this book is a bitter disappointment. This is a short story, not a novel. The print is as big as a children's book with wide margins, if published in an adult font and format it would have been 100-125 pages. There are a few laughs, but it doesn't make up for the underdeveloped plot and the lack of growth in the love story triangle. Please Janet, don't publish Eleven until before you finish the book, let Stephannie grow and move the love story ahead (any direction will do, just move it ahead)."
2,This was a stinker,"I have always liked Stephanie Plum, but this latest was a stinker. I know that this series is not meant to be taken seriously and Stephanie is a crazy girl, but the formula is getting old. The love triangle is never resolved, and the characters have become cardboard cutouts. I had a real problem with the end of the book - there wasn't one. It just seemed to come to a screaching halt with no resolution and a completely dumb final scene. I would not recommend purchasing this book. It left me hanging....and disappointed."
5,SLEEPLESS NIGHT,"I GOT THE BOOK LAST NIGHT AND READ IT IN LESS THAN 4 HOURS. JANET EVANOVICH JUST KEEPS MAKING LIFE A LITTLE MORE FUN WITH HER BOOKS. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT READ THIS BOOK(AND THE OTHER NINE) IS MISSING SOMETHING LIGHT, FUN, EXCITING, AND ADDICTIVE!!!!CAN'T WAIT FOR 11!!!!!"
4,Still lots of Laugh out Loud & Big Smile moments,"Some writers are trashing this 10th offering and accusing the author of having someone else write for her. So What! I laughed and smiled a lot as this book kept me company on my long daily commute. Have fun, buy it.. enjoy."
3,Another Wild Stephanie Plum Ride.,"Same Old. Same OldThere's nothing new in this book. It's still funny, and unexpected things happen. There's still lots of action. There's still sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger, there's still problems between Morelli and Stephanie. These things are OK because that's what makes the books so much fun. What's not OK is Stephanie's foolhardiness (Do I dare call it stupidity?) Stun gunning one of her bodyguards to again put herself in harm's way! Come On. I also found the ending was over the top. It was way out there, and it didn't make much sense. I found it hurried and puzzling. Anyway, I will continue to read these books for the craziness and the edgy dialogue, but don't read an Evanovich book if you're looking for complex plot."
2,Disappointed reader; Hopeful for #11 to be better,"I am quite disappointed with Evanovich's latest, 10 Big Ones. Like other readers, I could easily see that she probably wrote the first third and had a chance to develop it more (or her editor) and then rushed the rest. Where was her development editor?? It was his/her job to point out the weaknesses in the story and be the reader's advocate. Good endings should have some loose ends to spur me to eagerly anticipate the next book, but the sheer number of loose ends in this book just makes me frustrated. I definitely felt that I should have kept my money and waited in line at the library. If Evanovich is finding it this hard to write and is making the struggle so evident, perhaps it is time to wrap up the series and find some fresh material."
2,Disappointing overall,"I love the Stephanie Plum series and was eager to read the latest. This book, however, did not hold my interest. I thought the plot was weak and the characters, with the exception of Ranger and Joe, were dull and uninteresting. In fact, I got annoyed with the frequent mention of donuts and the unbelievable stupidity of Stephanie.There were still some laugh out loud scenes but even they did not make up for the boredom of the book and the abrupt ending. I am so glad I got the book from the library."
3,getting a bit stale,"I always look forward to the next Stephanie Plum novel, but thisone is a letdown. It's very formulaic and lacks the humor and energy of past Plum novels."
2,another rushed writing job,"This book felt like abut 2/3 of what we expect from Janet Evanovich: too many loose details, scenes that start well and fizzle, characters acting too far out of character. It was a fun read, but nowhere near what I expected for either humor or plot. Worst of all, Stephanie seems to be regressing toward adolescence instead of maturing in this story, and that was particularly annoying.FYI: there seem to be a lot of defective copies of this book - pages 281 to 312 missing, repeats of chapter 12 and 13, etc, so check the volume carefully before purchasing. Every single one in my local store was screwed up."
4,Good,"I love the Stephanie plum series. Series, this one was not as good but excited for the book number 11."
3,Disappointed Hard Core Fan,"I am a big fan of the series but I was really disappointed with this book. The plot was weak, the dialouge was threadbare, and Stephanine had little interaction with Ranger & Morelli. The ending of the novel seemed rushed and came off as an afterthought. I hope this was just a stumble in a usually dynamite series. I gave it three stars because there were a few really funny parts."
2,Huge Evanovich fan- terrible book,"I agree with an earlier reviewer in that I'm not even sure Janet Evanovich wrote all of this book. The dialogue is not of the same quality and the plot is meandering and pointless. I am very disappointed especially because I thought the ninth in the series was the best one since the very first, One for the Money. Don't get me wrong, I know these are light and funny mysteries and I don't expect Brian Haig or John Sanford-like writing. However there is a reason Evanovich is as popular as she is and it's because she has written a high quality series of funny, quirky books. This does not match the level of the others. Wait for the paperback or get it from the library."
2,"Formulaic, Redundant, Trite and Uninteresting","This tenth book of the Plum series is difficult to get interested in. The author seems to believe that the same old, repetitive jokes of the last nine books will be enough to satisfy her readers so they are used (and abused) excessively at the expense of a plot. There doesn't appear to be any suspense, mystery or story here. This is a boring book."
1,My Forehead Hurts from all the Slapping,"Exactly how many novels is it going to take before Stephanie Plum stops being a colossal idiot? The first 30 times her ineptitude prevents her from bagging somebody that any normal human could catch in their sleep were fairly humorous. Now, it's just plain annoying. She can't do anything right- ever. It's time for Stephanie to either improve at her work or hang up her cuffs. Of course, she doesn't HAVE any cuffs, since she continues to lose them. All I kept thinking through this entire book is, ""She is the biggest moron ever!"" I did not used to think this. I used to be amused by her. No more. Please, stop with the Lula and Grandma going out on busts. Pretty please. I'm only going to read one more book and if it's the same as the last 5 books, then Stephanie is on her own."
3,I'm Disappointed!,"Where was the ending? I thought it was an odd ending, not really a cliffhanger, but almost like the author met her page quota and quit writing. I hope we get to find out in #11 what happens but with past experience, we'll probably only get very little from Steph's flashbacks.I liked TBO but not as well as the other nine. I'm glad I just started reading the series last year and feel sorry for those who started it ten years (?) ago and still don't have any answers as to whom Steph will eventually wind up with, Ranger or Morelli or neither.Even though I'm disappointed how this book turned out, I will definitely be buying the #11 next year."
2,Once Again Back to Square One,"Just when I thought Stephanie had finally gotten her act together and was finally on right track to being a successful bounty hunter after reading ""To the Nines"" it appears she's back to being the same old Stephanie who doesn't have a clue, who can't decide what man she wants in her life and always Ranger/Morelli running to the rescue, another car lost (what insurance company would give her car insurance?), no bullets in gun or for that matter where is the gun? Enough already!!!Why do I keep doing this to myself? Because I keep wanting to see Stephanie grow up and stop being the bumbling idiot that she is, but will that ever happen? At this point I am doubtful."
2,COME ON!,"OK, come on Janet E., let's get some maturity going with Stephanie! How many times does her life have to be threatened for her to remember her gun?"
4,Braincandy,"I know. Evanovich is mindless braincandy. So why do I read these books?The truth is that I am secretly,desperately in love with Ranger. Sadly,it is a relationship that is going nowhere. I dread reaching the last page with every Evanovich; I know that's it for my love affair with Ranger for the year. And, now that I've finished page 312 and closed the book, dadgumit, that's it.Favorite Quote: ""It was a great kiss, but I didn'tknow what the heck it meant. It seemed to me that a breaking-up kiss would have had less tongue."""
4,Fun book just enought intrigue.,"I love the Stephanie Plum books they are fun with just enough suspene to maket them a true delight. Janet Evanovich is an excellent writer, I would recommend her books to anyone. I love Amazon and ease of buying and receiving a Kindle book."
4,I nearly died laughing,"Stephanie Plum reminds me of my friends and family. For those that didnt find this book entertaining have never had a Lula in her life. I have and I nearly died laughing from her lingo and her craziness.I read the book in one sitting...and was brought to tears during the scene with Connie, Steph, Lula, and the kidnapped thug. I even read it to my husband and I ruined it by the non stop laughter.Im new to this series and started reading at 9 when I picked it up at JKF airport and I was drawn in. I love the fact that you dont need to read the other books prior to get the gist of the relationships...and Evanovich makes the 1st chapter of the new book the last chapter in the previous...at least thats what I noticed between 9 and 10.Its definitely a fun read."
4,I liked it but......,"I can say i liked this book alot...but I didn't LOVE this book. Things seemed to be missing, while other things were too much in the spotlight. I didn't like the ending very much. Does Janet not know that Victoria's Secret makes the MIRACLE bra, not the WONDERBRA? I guess I'm fit to be tied until number 11 comes out for us to find out what happens with Valerie and Albert."
3,Her latest could be longer,"Having eagerly waited for this latest adventure of Stephanie Plum, I was a slightly disappointed in its story length. Although an extremely enjoyable read, I didn't feel the usual tension and suspense I have come to expect from Janet Evanovich. Everything was too predictable in this outing. On the pleasant side, the further developments of her family and the re-intriduction of a character from her past adventures provided quite a few laughs. Still worth reading, but unless you are a fanatic, wait for the peprback version."
4,Great fun read!,"I had grown a little bored with the last couple of books in the Stephanie Plum series, but this one grabbed my attention and found me hooked yet again. Lets be honest, we don't read these books because they're great literature, we read them because they're fun. But the formula had grown a little tired for me. I think this book is an improvement over the last for two reasons. One, Stephanie is starting to grow somewhat as a character. She is even able to apprehend some fugitives with -- dare I say it? -- a minimum of disasters. She's starting to ask herself why she and Morelli have the same on-again, off-again, encounters year after year. But the real reason this book held my attention was the increased level of sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger. Personally, I find the Morelli relationship played out anyway. But with ranger, this volume definitely turns up the heat!"
3,Same old story,I've read several Stephanie Plum numbered books and everyone has the same family plot. Albeit the main investigation is different how many times can you read of an upside-down-cupcake? Or why... sometimes S.P. doesn't love Joe or why she likes Ranger?If you already read another S.P. novel and you have another book take it. If this is your first novel you'll have some fun.
3,"Not the best Plum, but not the worst!","If you love this series, then this book was definetly worth reading. It was better than some in the middle of the series that I thought got a little slow. One high point was getting more into Rangers life and finding (at least one of) the ""bat caves."" The biggest let down for me was the ending. If feels like the book has a lot more to go, then in ten pages or less it goes from climax to caput! There needed to be much more winding down time. I love this series and I will read them all but I hope the next one is longer and finally wraps up some story lines that have been left 'to be continued,' a little to long."
1,What a dud!,"The earliest Stephanie Plum books were cute, not great, but entertaining. I haven't read the ones in between, but this one is so dumb as to defy description. The writing,the dialogue, the characters. Beyond description. Far more comic book caricatures than comical characters. I won't be reading another of these books because I can't be sure when they started going downhill. Read the first few in this series and skip this one."
2,Move the characters along,"I agree with other reviews that the book needed to be longer. If the words about food was taken out it would be a short story. It was padded with ridiculous scenes. The relationship with Morelli was boring and almost to the point of I don't care. I got very bored with Grandma and Lula. They really need to be kept as secondary characters and their mouths shut.I would have loved to see a book written about Ranger and Morelli with Stephanie left out. I still like those two characters but fed up with Stephanie not growing and being better at something.Don't bother buying a hardback book. You won't miss much waiting for the paperback. Actually I am sure that the discounted hardback books will be plentiful, which will be cheaper than the paperbacks. It was ashamed for this book to be printed as is."
3,So-so...,"Not a bad effort from Evanovich...just not one of her better ones. The story and characters needed more ""fleshing out."" Not enough development went into either. Perhaps another 25-50 pages would've alleviated those problems. And yeah, I'll probably buy #11 when it comes out as I've enjoyed the series over the years. I just hope this series won't go the way Lillian Jackson Braun's ""Cat Who..."" series has gone: flat writing, weak characterizations, and (rumor has it) ghostwritten books. C'mon, Janet...spend more time on your Stephanie Plum books. If you can't do justice to both series (Plum and the ""Full"" series), than dump or hand off one of them. Your readers deserve better, especially considering the $26 cover price."
2,"Same old, Same old","It hurts me to have to say this about a Stephanie Plum novel, but this book was tired and dull. Nothing new to the story line, Stephanie hasn't grown or progressed much, and this book was missing the normal laugh out loud moments so prevalent in the past Plum books. I hope that the next installment will be reenergized."
3,Ten Big One's review,"Evanovich's Plum series is fantastic, eagerly awaited each year and a must read. All of her Plum books are good some are just superior in quality. Having said this I have to state that ""10"" isn't superior and it barely makes it to borderline good category. For a high quality/established author such as Evanovich it's a disappointment. The story drags and it shouldn't since she introduces alot of plot material that she doesn't follow through on. ""10"" has an interesting story line but it seems like Evanovich relies on her old material for character development and nothing new or exciting happens to any of her characters. If anything, some of her characters seem like shadows of their former glorious past stories. Parts of ""10"" are extremely funny but they simply can't carry the whole book. At the end I felt like I had been left hanging without a clever cliff hanger or ending that Evanovich usually manages to pull off for Stephanie & company."
2,disappointing and repetitive......,"I have read all of these books. I loved Steph thru about book six. I kept reading to see if the triangle between Steph, Ranger and Morelli would get resolved. Despite some interesting characters, this series is getting tired and repetitive. It's not that funny to see Steph's car get wrecked for the umpteenth time. Time to wrap it up with Number Thirteen, Janet!! Quality over quantity...and Loyal Readers over Dollars."
2,Who wrote this book?,"Breaking my rule against buying hardcover mysteries, I got this one rather than waiting for the paperback for a jolt of Stephanie Plum's self-reliant and humorous bounty hunter. Poor editing, silly, and worse, unamusing, subplots and a voice that did not sound like the original author's made me wonder if JE wrote this. [Remember when Trevanian sold his name?] And the gang parts were just ridiculous; one of the things that makes the series work is the sense that the author knows something about what she is writing, but this book shows not only lack of knowledge but not even basic research on gang behaviour. C'mon I know these are mystery-light books, but give us some credit. The two stars are for encouragement. JE: please go back to writing the Stephanie Plum books again or end the series."
5,THE BEST ONE YET,"I think that this book was great.. I personally don't think it was rushed at all! I like the suspense of not knowing whether or not she'll end up with Ranger or Joe. I think that will be for the last book she'll do of the series. Until then I guess we'll all have to wait and see. I found that this book was very humorous, just as her previous 9 have been. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
2,grow up already!,After you read TEN of these books her naiveté gets to be grating. Surely by now she has learned SOMETHING. It quits being cute and funny. I loved the first books but the character has grown NONE.
2,Too Cute!,"I generally enjoy Evanovich's books. This one tries too hard to be too cute, too humorous and too entertaining. Lula and Grandma characters add to a book if used in small doses-tiresome when used in big doses as in this book.Sorry, I don't recommend ""Ten Big Ones."""
2,Too much fluff,There seemed to be too much repetition of trivial facts but not much actual interaction of Stephanie with any of the other main characters. Seemed more like fluff to me than the first books she wrote. I probably won't reread this one as I have the others. Would like to see more Joe or Ranger.
3,"Great book, bad reader","""Ten Big Ones"" is a terrific novel, but why did Lorelei King get the job for the audiobook version? She stinks! Where is C.J. Critt when we need her?"
3,Could Have Been Better,"No matter what, I still love this series but truthfully this book lacked something compared to the others. There wasn't really anything sexy, it wasn't as witty and it did not have me on the edge like the others. Stephanie and Lula are still the same, Connie and Vinnie and Joe are the same and we do not get to see that much of Ranger. I just hope the reason for that is because he will be featured in the 11th book. If you have already read all the other books in this series, then definitely continue and read this one. If this is to be your first Stephanie Plum novel, I beg you start at the beginning because this one does not do the series or the characters justice."
4,one of my favorites!,"I only recently discovered the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, and I haven't been able to get enough of the crazy characters and interesting tales. Ten Big Ones has to be one of my favorites from the series. Some of my favorite characters reappeared-Sally Sweet and a little more from Stephanie's Grandma Mazur. I thought the pull between Ranger and Morelli was starting to really heat up. The end was unexpected and left me looking forward to number eleven!"
3,disappointing,There is way too little Morelli and way too little humor to compensate for the way too little Morelli. This book was disappointing and my least favorite so far.
2,Series has lost it's sparkle,"The first three of the Plum series were very fun reads. Now it seems worn and tired. To The Nines was not worth the hardback price, so I read this one in the bookstore and put it back. (Its a fast read...wait for it at the library or paperback) Evanovich needs some fresh ideas for this series, she can't string us along with the same old any longer."
1,Total Trash.,groan!This had to be one of the worst books I've read in ages. I could barely suffer through it. Characters were poorly developed. I have tossed this garbage in the fireplace. At least there it is put to good use.Secret Life of Bees had rich thorough character development (as an example of quality workmanship).
3,Insulting,"I love the Stephanie Plum series. Each one truly built on the last which made the series so addicting. I was eager to read this one, but was sorely disappointed. As some others have stated, the ending was ridiculous. It seemed as if Janet Evanovich was getting close to her deadline and decided to slap together an ending that insulted the reader. There were a lot of insulting details that irked me, but the ending was the ultimate insult. I gave the book 3 stars because I liked the attention given to Ranger and Joe."
3,"C'mon Janet, you're coasting!","I love all of the characters in these books and that's what keeps me reading them. As the series progresses there is less and less to them: less plot and less pages. Just compare ""One for the Money"" to any of the subsequent novels and you'll see what I mean. I enjoyed reading ""Ten Big Ones"" but I only wish there had been more to it. Will we be looking for the Stephanie Plum novels in the easy reader section for children soon?"
2,Stopped short,I love Stephanie Plum and all of the situations she finds herself in. It is always a laugh out loud read but this time I felt short-changed at the ending. I got the sense that the book was printed with the last chapter or two missing. I felt like I was left hanging and that things were not wrapped up with Joe and Ranger and the rest of the crazy bunch. Other than that it was pure Plum action. I guess I'll just have to wait for 11!
2,Boredom!,"I eagerly awaited the release of the latest Stephanie Plum novel in audio format, and I was greatly disappointed. Ten Big Ones is just a rehash of the same `ol same `ol, Stephanie's cars blow up, her grandmother obsesses about Stiva's, and Stephanie's love life is just dull dull dull. I'm not a big Joe fan, but having Stephanie shack up with him, has been the kiss of death to this series. The only bright spot was the return of Sally Sweet, the drag queen, whom I really liked.What disappoints me the most is that Stephanie is still incompetent. After ten books, she still hates guns, leaves them in the cookie jar and has her cars blow up, and men rescue her all the time. Please girl. Get some skill or get out of the bounty hunter biz!I used to be able to take Stephanie with a modicum of seriousness, but the series has degraded into sophomoric humor and slapstick. Not my bag!"
1,DISAPPOINTING - BORING,"I can never wait until June/July each year for the Publication of a new Stephanie Plum. I love this series. But, unfortunately 8 & 9 seemed to lack originality and now 10 hits the jackpot for boredom. I have always loved the humour and the characters and when I re-read the earlier books I find them just as entertaining and amusing as they were on the first read. Stephanie in 10 I find, annoying, boring and childish, she is like a record stuck in a groove. When is she going to grow up!!! It would be much more interesting if the characters and their relationships evolved. This book started off OK but it is as if the author lost interest or lost the plot after the first couple of chapters. The ending is so abrupt I think in the end she lost interest completly. I hope Janet Evanovich can rectify this in the next book, if she can't she should finish this series and try something new, because Stephanie in her current persona is really getting old."
3,funny stuff,Another entertaining read. The bounty hunter up to her usual and not so usual tricks. The ending was a bit of a surprise!
4,Another terrific C.J. Critt performance,"Character development? Let's face it, we're not reading the Stephanie Plum series for literary enrichment... it's just supposed to be FUN. And this one is lots of laughs.To the reviewer who complained about the narrator - I had the library version which was narrated by C.J. Critt - I'm not sure why it's not offered for sale here on Amazon? I agree that she is - hands down - one of the best readers in the business. I'd listen to her read the tax code! Enjoy!"
3,Ten Not-So-Big Ones,"Right up front, Evanovich fans probably agree that even a bad Stephanie Plum mystery is better than a whole lot of everything else that's out there. Nevertheless, we wuz robbed! The print is too big, the margins are too wide, the book is too short and the ending is way too abrupt. Hardcovers aren't cheap. When I was nine and starting reading Nancy Drews in two hours, I stopped spending my allowance on them. Get the analogy, Ms. Evanovich?"
3,Enjoyable Light Entertainment,"I enjoyed Ten Big Ones more than I expected, but then again, I did wait for the paperback to come out. Loved the return of Sally to the story line. Loved that Connie, Lula and Stephanie discovered they had some moral lines they would not cross. Enjoyed Stephanie's dad and his frustration over the crazy women in his life. Appreciated that the donuts are finally impacting Stephanie's waist line. No one should eat that much junkfood and escape the consequences.Thought it was interesting to see more hard core crime, in the form of gangs, move into Trenton. Appreciated that this crime scourge was harder to work against than the ""mob"".I would categorize this as light summer readiing appropriate for the beach or a plane ride."
3,"A good read, but not her best","I enjoyed the book except for the ending. The ending seemed rushed and implausable. I loved Sally Sweet as the wedding coordinator. THe book had me laughing, as they all do. I recommend reading it, but maybe not buying it unless you like to have complete sets of books, go to the library and borrow it or wait for the paperback :)"
5,fabulously funny,this was my first Stephanie PLum novel- laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.
4,"Not the best in the series, but laugh your pants off anyway","It's not the best of the Stephanie Plum serial novels from Janet Evanovich, but it still made me burst out laughing like all the others before it. If you have read the series then of course you must continue, it's still too good to stop. And if you've never read Janet Evanovich or the Stephanie Plum novels then start right now (but obviously start with One For the Money). I gave all my friends the first book for Christmas and by New Year's they were addicts and now are buying the others in the series like mad. I've read other Evanovich novels and I still like Stephanie Plum the best out of all her characters. Can't wait for more."
1,Not worth buying,"If you're a fan of the series check this one out at the library -- don't waste money on it like I did.I LOVE this series, but this book is almost identical to the 9th one (nothing resolved, nothing really new introduced) and even if you wanted the complete set you wouldn't need this one to jump from book 9 to 11. As for the Ranger info, that could easily be dealt with in a paragraph in book 11 -- all we really learned is he has a nice apartment, a cleaning lady and good-smelling soap!I, too, used to look forward to the new books, but I had an inkling not to buy this one and should have listened to it.I'd rather wait two years for the next one if that meant it would be interesting and back on par with the first six or so."
3,My Least Favorite of the Series,"Enough of the tastycakes OK. I have loved this series and would have rated all the others a big 5 stars but this one is just not up to par. There were some very funny scenes, but overall it was just plain lacking.The story line was too short with too much filler. The ending just kind of left you hanging. Nothing was tied up at the end, you don't know what happened with Stephanie and Morelli and/or Stephanie and Ranger. Did Valerie go through with the marriage? Etc, etc.Plus I think after nine books, maybe Stephanie can start to grow up some. She has not developed emotionally since book one.This book won't cause me to give up the series, I can always hope that Ms. Evanovich has not yet burned out on this character and so I will eagerly await the next installment in hopes that it will be more up to par with the previous nine books."
3,"Funny, but......","I have read all the Stephanie Plum novels and waited patiently for ""Ten Big Ones,"" however, I was disappointed for several reasons.The novel was short. I read it in one afternoon. It also lacked the excitement that we Plum lovers have seen in the past between Stephanie and Ranger. Ranger was hardly in the book at all and the exchanges between Stephanie and Joe were boring. It seems as though they have fallin into a so-so relationship that is more like a good friendship than a love affair.The story-line started out really good and then fizzled at the end. I was expecting so much more from the plot but the ending left me feeling like there should have been more.While I loved Lulu, Grandma Mazur and Sally Sweet ,the story still lacked something. If it hadn't been for these characters the book would have totally bombed.Sorry, but Janet Evonovich wasn't ready for the ""Ten Big Ones."""
5,AUDIO VERSION IS AWESOME!!!,"Picked the audio book up at the library...had never heard of ""Stephanie Plum"" so didn't know this was 10th in a series...and absolutely loved it. I wasn't looking for ""developing characters or relationships"", just looking for a good story and I got one! Great characters gave me lots of laughs!! Definately worth the listen or the read."
4,"i'm a hard core fan, and i'm dissapointed","Where is ranger in most of the book? where are the laughs? I think janet didn't work as hard on this book as she could of. We got to understand the charachters a little more, and it was still a plum book, but there was something missing. The plot wasn't really there, and the dialouge wasn't really interesting, and ranger was missing for most of the book. Grr! that got me frusturated. Since im a hard core fan, i still liked this book, with all the ranger/stephanie momnets, and it stilll had some (not a lot) giggle laughs."
2,Evanovich needs some fresh ideas for these characters.,This is by far my least favorite of the series. The story lacks excitement and I'm getting frustrated with Stephanie's inept lifestyle. Maybe it is the way it is written. Maybe it is the rehashing of the same old scenarios. It's just not as riveting and as fun as the other books. Don't get me wrong. I will read any future Stepanie Plum books that Evanovich produces. I am still interested in how these characters and their situations are resolved. But this one is a clunker.
2,More Morelli!!!,"I have read all of Janet's books. Forget her outside romances, but her numbered ones are entertaining. One and four are the best so far. I read them for Morelli and Ranger. They were pretty much wooden here. But the rest of the book is an amusing read. Get them from the library. They really arent worth the high price of a hardcover, IMHO."
3,"Sorry, not a 10 !","This story was a bit of a disappointment to me because I thoroughly enjoyed To the Nines, the last book in the series. I listen to all the Stephanie Plum books on audio because the narrator does such a great job with the voice impersonations. This story wasn't as funny as some of the others and parts were a bit repetitive. The parts about Ranger's apartment and his ""merry men"" were great incites into the mystery man's lifestyle. Overall it is a great series and I have to keep reading to find out whether Stephanie will ever make a choice between hot Ranger or hot Morelli!"
5,Great reading,"Janet Evanovich is a very talented and funny writer..her stories are life like..wish I could meet the her inspirations for the "" Stephanie Plum"" book."
4,Enjoyed the book,"I've read many books in this series. Ten Big Ones was not my absolute favorite, but I would have to say that I did enjoy the time spent reading it.When reading a book of hers, I judge how well I like it by how many times I burst out laughing. In some of her other books, I couldn't stop laughing. Ten Big Ones produced a few laughs from me, so that's why I gave it 4 stars.Also, a few new things in her personal life kept me turning the pages.Overall, not a fantastic read, but worth the time.No Child Left Behind? The True Story of a Teacher's Quest"
5,Incredible,"This was the first book that I started reading out of the series. I read it back in high school and ended up reading this one first because it was the first one that I found in my school's library and I did not realize at the time that it was part of a series. I absolutely loved this book and it made me read more of the series! I have now read books number 1 through 12. I haven't picked up a book in a while but when I do, it has always been a Janet Evanovich book. Each book has its own thrilling mysteries and plenty of excitement in many meanings. I believe that I need to catch up and start reading book number 13. I would definitely recommend any of these books in the series to someone looking for some comedic suspense with some spice mixed in."
4,Lighten up!,"A lot of the reviewers seem to be looking for Chekov when the fact is the Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, Lula, et. al. are just plain fun. Maybe there was a little obsession with weight and shower gel but there were some laugh out loud moments and Evanovich is still my favorite guilty pleasure. Speaking of guilty pleasures, Ranger is the only fictional character to ever get my pulse racing.Bring on the Plum movie!"
4,A Good Read,"I have read all of the Stephanie Plum books and expected a surplus of laughter in the pages of this book, only the ending brought that reaction. We can all have a bad day and reading the next book will complete the picture hopefully of recovery of her particular type of humor. The book is good just not the excellent we all expect of Evanovich.Beverly J Scott author"
1,Stinks,"I gave it a good 20 minutes before gagging and tuning in to a rerun of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"". I would rather watch commercials."
4,Good Information,My husband saw this series on PBS and thought it very informative and he wanted it so I could see it.
2,A dud,"Compared with Ferguson's other work, this is a dud. Too much of his presentation is breathless, so that everything he says comes off as THE most shocking/impressive/awesome thing he's ever said. There's a lot of braod generalizations and too little to actually hang on to. I also do not like the way he uses modern images and films to illustrate the story of hundreds of years ago. Why not use period images? There are plenty."
1,Overrated,"Its ironic how the west created so many things BUT YET it collapses way too quickly. great civilisations such as china and india lived for THOUSANDS of years without having to conquering others.Neil Fergusons doesn't know what he is talking about, trust me I've been to europe and americas, I'm NOT impressed. So the name of the doco should be ""how the east survives and stood the test of time and how the west is dieing"" So i think this is a joke doco. Its not suppose to be serious. I study abit of western history aswell and I found out that the reason why the west advances IS because they are IMPERIALISTS, they took ppl's land and steal their resources and copy their techs. It's amazing how japan, china, vietnam, thailand, and india all have such so strong and tough survivalists, they were able to outlast western civilisations.I'm an Australian not an Asian btw."
3,"The ""Black Mafia""","I read this book in about three hours and enjoyed much of it. This is another book that raises the shade a little higher on the criminal behavior of the NOI in it's early form. I think this book is made up of a great deal of unremarkable characters, most of whom could be anyone in the inner-citys of this country. They only became a ""Mafia"" after they joined forces with the NOI. I wish this angle would have been explored in greater detail. The book slowed for me somewhat when it came to describing the roles of lawyers and politicians in the growth of the ""Black Mafia"", reserving only one paragraph for some. This book is a good read in my opinion. Although a better title and direction for this book would have been, ""The Black Mafia and the Myth of the Nation of Islam"". I would have liked to have seen pictures of crime scenes, actual recovered documents from the Mafia and the FBI (the author typed these himself). Good read, it just didn't go far enough for me."
3,cute if you are a beginner,"If you are just getting into spells or want a friend to learn this is a great book. No harm spells, and has a good beginning to learning when and how spells are cast."
5,The only choice for LS-120 drives,"If you have an Imation SuperDisk drive, then Imation SuperDisks are your media of choice. Unlike Zips and floppies, where one brand works about as well as the other, I would (and do) use only Imation disks in an LS-120 drive. Since support for this technology is waning, stock up now!"
2,AWFUL!,"This is one of the books where the male character is much more likeable than the female character. From the beginning of the book, Stephen is a genuine knight in shining armor. He seems to be real with Lauren about how he feels, and what he wants. Yes, their love story moved very quickly but sometimes that happens in real life so that wasn't the issue for me. My issue was Lauren had such a victim mentality. First, She wasn't honest with anyone about how she felt for Stephen. Second, She always fell back on the whole 'my husband cheated on me and I had my heart broken so I am protecting myself from being hurt' thing. Finally, she didn't take any real responsibility for her actions, i.e. keeping a disk on her guy for ""research"" and wasnt going to tell Stephen she was pregnant. The girl didn't deserve the guy."
1,Scary,"This book was not romantic. It was scary. What woman in her right mind would date a mind who has been watching her for weeks? She comfortable enough to use the bathroom with him in the room, she moved to another town with him yet they still didn't know each other's birthday. That didn't make any sense at all. Another thing that bothered me is that Stephen never wanted to talk about his past! Almost everythig she learned she learned froom his friends. SCARY!"
2,Could have been better,"This book could have been really really good, but things moved too fast. I really thought that things would move nice and slow for Lauren and Steven but by the third date they are sleeping together, and a month later they are living together. I liked the plot it was weak, but good enough. I hated how Lauren gets pregnant, and then there is very little mention of this growing child inside of her except for the occasional gesture to her belly she makes, also getting married in 6 months is also unrealistic and does not make any sense for the Lauren character who was so afraid of commitment before."
1,Daewoo - you get what you pay for,"Every DVD we tried freezes for a few seconds and then ""catches up"" but jumping ahead. This happens every few minutes throughout the movies. Definitely do not buy this item no matter how tempted you are by the price -- pay a little more, it will be well worth it!"
1,Stutters on every disc,"So far I have tried to play Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, Jacob's Ladder, and The Big Lebowski, and periodically the picture freezes or slows down and the audio cuts out for a second. <Sigh.> I should have known better: you get what you pay for.It is a nice unit except for the fact that it doesn't work. :-\Nice remote, nice outputs (coax, optical, s-vhs)."
3,A happy customer so far?,"I understand a lot of people are upset about this product. I was, too, when I first began playing Gladiator.Apparently, all of the movement and action in the opening scene was too much for the little box to handle without making it look extremely choppy. I found a solution, however...Originally, I had hooked the DVD output to my VCR, which, in turn, fed into my TV. I found that the signal was much more clear if I connected the DVD directly to my TV's video input."
4,Oregon desert,"In addition to the rainforest-like Western OR, the state also has a deserty Eastern half, a very remote corner of which the Kirkpatricks chose to homestead. To the non-believer, Jane's fervent evangelicalism will be a distraction to the narrative, but overall there are enough interesting anecdotes to hold interest. This is not a memoir about living the simple life; the Kirkpatricks actually had their own plane. Jane does not mention the irony that planes like theirs are responsible for the worst form of noise pollution to those attempting to live in or visit the wilderness."
5,Don't miss this.,"This CD is what? 8 years old? Today's artists still haven't caught up. A brilliant piece of work. If you like trip-hop, neo-soul you'd better grab this one."
3,I liked it overall,"The movie got slow and contrived at some points, but it was surprisingly funny for an independent and the main character is a very likeable guy."
4,Provocative,"The movie was not exactly what i thought, it started a little slow. Fat guy who cant quit the food that is bad for him. He decides to move to the country to get away from all the pressures of home. He takes with him his buddy who has an addiction of his own. The movie shows how each handle the addiction differently. A very movie story. IT was a 4.25 in my book. I have recommended it to everyone i know."
1,Not a documentary,I watched this movie because I am interested in health and weight loss. It was not what I expected. Far to much swearing for me and left me feeling like what a waste of time.
1,Waste of time movie,"I was tricked by the cover into buying this boring and uninspired movie. Instead of having the main character educate himself on his health or really look at his reasons for eating, he just runs away to the woods. It shows very little of him figuring out what to eat and how to fix his health, and too much on time showing him just laying around. A much better movie is Fat,Sick and Nearly Dead, which shows two men really working through the health issues in an informative and interesting way. The other reviewers must be related to the writer. There is no way that this deserves 4 or 5 stars. It's just a less interesting remake of Fatso, the movie by Dom Deluise. The only reason this gets one star is that there is no way to indicate a half star!"
2,F Bombs,"This movie had a good plot but I had to stop watching it. Every other word was the F word. A truly good movie is far more inventive. If you have a passion for foul language, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,Just ok,I had high hopes for this movie but it wasn't really anything special and it could have done a much better job exploring this topic.
3,worth the watch,"This was a good watch. Acting was ok. Story was fresh. It was touching, funny, sad, pathetic, and real. It won't make you hungry."
3,"Not the best, but still inspiring","The acting was not first rate, and the film felt long. I, personally, could not relate to the character's constant exasperation with his family. Although, they seemed silly and occasionally over zealous about eating, I interpreted his behavior as ""finger-pointing"" and blame towards them for his out of control weight. Being overweight myself, I have to say that the only person you can blame is yourself. It's not easy saying no to food (for someone like me), but people can and have done it.That aside, the story was inspiring and realistic in that people sometimes relapse into old habits, but I probably wouldn't watch it a second time."
4,Good and True,This movie tells a story that is unhappily very common in the U.S.Loved the acting and the candid tone.
5,Just Loved it!,"I thorouly enjoyed and was entertained by this movie. Even though There were some heavy moments, I laughed a bit as well. I recommend watching this movie."
1,Couldn't get past the foul language!,"I am currently enjoying a lot of documentaries on the food movement, so I thought I would would check this out. I tried to watch it, but only made it about 20 minutes. It featured way too much foul language. Not my style or one that I would want played in my house."
2,Not as good as other reviews would have you believe.,"So I enjoined the first 3/4 of this movies, the last 1/4 had some decent insights into self transformation but I would't call this movie ""inspirational"" unless you turned it off 3/4 of the way in.None of the characters that interact with the protagonist are very believable, I'm not sure if this is just over the top acting or if the characters are really played through the eye of the protagonist.Rather then an ""inspirational film about self-transformation""; I would say that this is a sobering view of addiction."
2,Not a Documentary,"This was listed as being a documentary and so I started it. It's clearly not, and from what I can tell (I only watched 20 minutes it's not that great of a movie."
2,LBS.,This is a dumb movie but it did make you think. no matter what you change about your self people will try to concentrate on the negative. You shouldn't change just to be accepted.
3,From a guy who typically enjoys movies like this,"Based on the description I thought the movie sounded like it'd be right up my alley. It's not that the movie is bad i thought it was OK but if your idea of a good movie is... any of the transformer movies, then this probably isn't going to be a movie you will enjoy. Average at best is the most accurate brief review i can give."
2,Sad. . .Just very. . . very. . . sad. . . . .,"This film is/was incorrectly listed under ""comedy"" on Amazon.com. A better listing would be ""documentary"".For the record. . . I'm overweight myself. I've been this guys weight, though I'm not now.Somewhere or the other I saw the word ""inspirational"". This movie is NOT ""inspirational"". It's really just sad. Sad in SO many ways. It's just one sad thing after another. You want there to be some sort of redeeming value. . . . At least a ""happy ending"". . . but there's really not. It's just sad and boring."
1,Soup Sandwich,"The movie did have some potential, but it went downhill in a hurry. The plot was dreadful, absolutely dreadful. It was like the writer(s) copy and pasted what they thought were good movie qualities, but the end product was a soup sandwich. With about 5 minutes to go in the movie, the plot lost all meaning. The acting was bad, the script was bad, the meaning was lost...save yourself some trouble and watch something else."
5,Surprisingly good!!,"I thought this was a good movie about one man's journey to correct what he thought was the problem in his life...his weight. After losing the weight, he realized that there was much more to the problems in his life than just his weight. He had a deeper addiction problem with food and was able to recognize it and work towards fixing himself along with the weight loss. His family and friends also seemed to be ashamed of his weight and then still not pleased with him when he lost the weight. People are cruel no matter what you do. I was surprised by a few of the storylines in the movie, but over all it was a great film."
4,Great Movie!,"As someone who struggles with weight, I found this movie to be inspiring and I can relate to the guy in the movie who is just looking for his place in the world....Bravo! Awesome Movie!"
4,Just what we wanted!,"We required hair nets that had no outer elastic. These have an elastic, but it is soooo fine that they work well....better than others we have tried. Lots of colour choice available.Highly recommend."
1,Book will NOT teach you about growing Bonsai in the desert,"This book is little more than a historical review of old newsletters from the Phoenix Bonsai Society. I sincerely doubt it would have any appeal to a non-member. It is not a book on techniques for growing Bonsai in a desert climate. Rather, it is a trivia and date laden, difficult to follow, historical overview/ramble on garden societies, Asian-Americans in America, with vast and (to my mind, uninteresting) lists of old members, who's plant won at what competition, and reminiscences of old meetings. If there are any tips on actually growing Bonsai in a desert environment, I was unable to find them in approximately thirty minutes of effort, and frankly, after skiming the book I had no desire to actually attempt to read it cover to cover. Good Luck."
1,A history of the club with essentially no bonsai info.,"The book would have general interest for those who belonged to the Phoenix club and wanted a record of its history. However, I purchased the book based on the ""review"" provided by Amazon.com, in which it was implied that desert bonsai techniques were discussed. After much digging through the book, I found nothing on what it takes to grow and maintain bonsai in desert environs. If there was any cultivation information, it was well masked by the historical text. In summary, both the title and the ""review"" were misleading. All in all, very unhelpful. I have sent the book back for a refund."
4,"On the Unseriousness of Human Affairs: Teaching, Writing, Playing, Believing, Lecturing, Philosophizing, Singing, Dancing","Fr. Schall, as always, proves that he is both a wonderful mentor in important matters of life and a guide to show the way to other mentors. This book is very enjoyable to read. I think it will help its readers to better understand ""the priorities of life"" and proper order."
3,Not so much,"I'm a little confused, but I had ordered one first from somewhere, and the colors were real faded. I think it was this one. So i had to order it through sum1 else, that had one with much brighter colors."
4,Quite satisfied,"I purchased this book because it was recommended by my homeschooling curriculum. I had misgivings because the grade level is listed on the cover as grades 5-12, but my daughter is in grade 3. Since I've purchased it, however, I have used it just about every week. There are a great many ideas which can be used as-is, or can be adapted to different ages. It is really geared more towards a classroom, but most of the activities can be used with just one or two children. I frequently lead our weekly co-op, which has 7 children ages 6 to 11, and this book has been absolutely fabulous for that setting. I will probably keep this book for years to come, because there are so many recipes and activities."
4,"America: Ready-To-Use Interdisciplinary Lessons & Activities for Grades 5-12 (Social Studies Curriculum Activities Library, Vol",Great book!
5,Hungry heart,"Her teaching still rings loudly to the lost, the Luke warm and the hearts that seek deeper things of God. Every page leaves us searching scriptures with hungry desires for more of His truth to be applied to our lives."
1,wrong adapter,I purchased this product for my HP compaq 6715b laptop...It is the wrong adaptor.....It comes with a 1.5 mm pin and is not the 2.5 mm as advertised.The company emailed me and said they do not have the proper 2.5 mm pin configuration adapter
3,Hardly a remaster.... but good nonetheless!,"This is a nice compilation of ELO songs, four of which that did not make the cut on ELO's boxset in 1990, Afterglow. (Standing In The Rain, Stranger, Night In The City and Fire On High)This is a very nice, inexpensive collection of ELO songs from their post-Eldorado era. However, the album is NOT remastered. It has good production (same as on Afterglow), not too bright, lots of audio headroom and it has a nice version of Night In The City (no dropouts like on the 2007 remastered Out Of The Blue).If you want to initiate someone who is unfamiliar with ELO, this is the album to get them."
5,Great movie!,"I received an advance copy of ""Yoga Is"" from a friend at a yoga studio and I loved it! Suzanne's journey is compelling and she asks fascinating questions that allowed me to get many insights into yoga as well as the human experience. Great work!"
2,Not what I expected,If your into the spritual mumbo gumbo of Yoga then this is your film. I do yoga for the exercise benefit and thought this film might have some good information but dealt with the spiritual aspect and nothing with yoga as an exercise.
5,"A powerful & fun movie, full of inspiration & hope.","I saw this movie at it's Los Angeles premiere and was amazed this is the first film that Suzanne Bryant ever made. Polished, perfected and beautiful. I look forward to purchasing a copy of this next month when it comes out because it's something I can watch over and over again. Suzanne does something many documentaries fail to do, she makes you laugh, then hits you with a deep ""wow"" moment right after. It's funny, magical, hopeful and full of positive energy. The timing of this documentary couldn't be more perfect. With so much suffering in the world, Suzanne shows us her path through pain, and how we need to laugh more, do yoga more, and change our viewpoint into one of hope."
3,It was a good narrative,"I didn't get from it what I was looking for, but, it wasn't distasteful. I would want others to view it and decide for themselves."
3,Informative but slow developing,This was a decent documentary if you are able to make it through the whole thing. It has points where it seems to take too long to get to the point. Overall though pretty decent.
5,It's a Fuel Tank - what's there to say?,"Bought one of these last year - installed on an old Wahoo Flats boat - as the on-board (glassed in) tank won't draw. Used some strap tank hold-downs and it stays put. You'll need to sort out the fuel line connections. Seems to vent adequately - run a 90hp Evinrude FICHT off it w/no probs. Again - it's a fuel tank...as long as it vents properly, and doesn't leak there's not much to go wrong."
5,"Fabulous, fabulous!","This text is great for students, new clinicians, and old clinicians. Dr. Lynn Adams has laid out an entire plan for group therapy with children with Asperger Syndrome in this one text. It includes therapy suggestions for all ages of children. The accompanying DVD is fabulous! It takes the work from the text and puts in right into the video. It is a great display of how the activities are integrated into therapy. Radford University Speech and Hearing Clinic and Autism Center have a great resource and are very fortunate to have accreditation with it."
4,good resource,"I thought about this book a long time before buying it. Now that I have it, I find I don't use it as often as I thought I would in my own social skills groups. I really enjoyed the introductory chapter on running groups. I also like how the author divided the activities by age group, and then further categorized by skill type. I have used some of the activities but some of them require too many materials or too-specific materials. It is a good resource to have on the shelf."
5,This is one of the most valuable books I know.,"I am the author of a half-dozen books on American women, and THE FAIR WOMEN is one of the sources to which I return again and again. Jeanne Weimann did an absolutely masterful job, and the photos are incredible. It provides a terrific overview of the status of women in many places at the turn of the century, and it's full of bios of barely-known women. I would not sell my copy for any price.Doris WeatherfordExecutive Editor, WOMEN'S ALMANAC"
4,Chicago 1893,"Far more than anyone thinks they want to know about the Women's Building, but the deeper you delve into it the more fascinating the topic is."
4,No problems-excellant for pansies,It is what it is- no problems. Its a good shape for a narrow area or shelf and good size for small plants and seedlings. Not really enough room for strawberries with runners- maybe one/two plants. Excellant for pansies! Green plastic- might be able to find at your local store/nursery and save shipping.
4,"THrilling,exciting and SEXY!!!!","Watching Sexy Jane March is worth it alone in this flick..Willis is great too.. I know this movie got bad reviews but lets not forget we can`t blame the actors/actresses..Good suspensefull movie..I`d like to see the un-rated European version, I don`t know where to get it.. John M.. Brooklyn,NY"
4,"HELLO, FULL FRONTAL","The first time that I can remember Bruce in a full frontal nude scene. Not bad, let's see if the directors cut offers any length..."
3,"Enjoyably, wonderfully bad","This movie has some really great actors in it, it looks great, has an intrguing plot, and still manages to be pretty terrible--but terrible in a very entertaining way. I laughed a lot when I wasn't supposed to but, hey, how many movies make you laugh at all these days? See this for the fun of it and don't expect the quality cast to make it a ""quality"" film. The only ""quality"" here is unintentional hilarity. And, of course, a couple of wacky sex scenes. Oh, and a nail-gun, too, that's something you don't see everyday!"
5,Excellent Suspense! Great Movie!,"After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to give this movie a chance. I find it so ludicrous that all people were concerned with was the SEX! Why can't people look beyond that. The movie was very suspenseful (sometimes predictable). I have to agree that I had a pretty good idea of whodunnit most of the time, but it ended really well and blew me away. I would have never guessed the ending and that is the best part of a suspense thriller. I could have done without all the nudity and sexual connotations. Scott Bakula was great in his small role as he always is. I enjoy all of this work. I also enjoyed seeing Bruce Willis in something different. It seems he is always typecast."
4,I loved it!,"I steered away from this movie when it was released because of all the bad reviews, but caught it on cable last night and loved it! Sure, there were a few things that were obvious from the beginning to the viewer that should have been obvious to the characters, but what the hey! I found it both suspenseful and erotic. Bruce Willis was a pleasure for the eyes and the mind. And it had that staple of any good movie to me--you really couldn't guess what was going to happen next. I did think the therapy group was a little over-the-top in their behavior, but that only added to the entertaining drama."
3,Color Of Night,An ok sexual suspense thriller .The film does have its moments and there is a good twist towards the end.The film is a bit long being over 2 hours and is at times a bit slow.I thought Bruce Willis was very good as the psychologist who takes over the therapy group when his Colleague Bob is murdered. The sex scenes in the film are good. There are some good scenes with a snake and some car chase scenes.
4,Under rated thriller,"I waited to see this movie when it came out for rent back in 1995, because of the horrible reviews. After seeing it, I was shocked at how bad the reviews were! This was a thriller with twists and turns and a jaw dropping ending!! Maybe the sex wasn't all that great, but there is more to a movie than sex! I am happy to now own it on DVD!!"
4,Sexy thriller with Shannon Elizabeth as a cross dressing mental patient. Fun movie.,Fun campy film with interesting story line and very erotic scenes. Loved it! This movie is not for those who are easily offended by sex and nudity in film.
1,Funny movie,"If you thought this movie was funny, then I think you'd like ""Daddy's Girl."" It's supposedly a suspense movie, but comes off as a comedy, like Color of Night."
3,"The sex scenes were meaningless, and killed the story!","Though this movie was a descenty put together in terms of building a mystery, this movie was to ""back and forth"" in the turms of meaningful mystery related material as to the amount of seeming pointless nudity."
4,Color Of Night,Bruce Willis plays Bill Capa in this erotic thriller. There are many twists in it right till the end. Some critics panned it but I found it worth watching and his acting in it as very credible. Different from his action and comedy roles which shows his versatility as a leading male actor.Don't let the R rating sway you as here in Aussie land it would only have received an M rating.
1,Terrible thriller you don't need to see,"The Bottom Line:Far too long and stupid to even pass as ""so bad it's good"" entertainment, the only thing Color of Night has going for it is a ton of nudity, but even that can't keep viewer interest for long; all things considered, this is a dumb, boring film which has been rightfully forgotten by time and needn't be seen by anyone.1/4"
3,Soft-core Porn with an overused plot,"The best thing about this movie is the various sex scenes. The plot is painfully obvious and has been used and reused various times prior to the release of this particular movie. The director and producers clearly wanted to produce a fully pornographic movie with A and B-list actors, but for whatever reason were unable to fully commit to doing it that way.The movie is a good soft-core porno if you take it as one, however if you expect anything more you might be disappointed."
1,.,"Ahh -- bad film-making at its worst. A truly unengaging bomb. There was one sex scene that half-woke me from the daze in which I spent most of the two hours I wasted sitting in front of my television while this tape played, but even that was silly and poorly done. I guess I just like to see Jane March naked. But if you want to see Jane March naked, you'd be better off renting the Lover (although it too is a poor film.)"
3,Plot was not bad...,"The plot was pretty good. Since it has been rehashed by several reviewers, I won't go over it again. I have a different opinion of some of the other viewers about the actress who played the love interest. She had the body of a twelve-year-old boy and I do not think the sex scene came off that well."
2,"Laughable, but entertaining","Color Of Night is one of those bad bad movies that makes you feel guilty at the end for actually enjoying it. Even though the script is just awful, director Richard Rush brings enough energy and style to make it entertaining.The acting ranges from bad to worse to just plain ridicoulus. Jane March is too cute and sweet to be convincing as the mysterious femme fatale. Ruben Blades and Leslie Ann Warren are just annoying. And Bruce Willis tries his best. Only the alway-excellent Brad Dourif manages to escape with his credibility intact. His performance as the neurotic lawyer is the strongest performance in the whole movie. The film is nicely shot by the late cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann, and composer Dominic Frontiere provides and excellent score."
4,Color of Night,"One of Bruce Willie's earlier films that stands out in my opinion. Ladies if you haven't seen ""Bruce almighty"", watch the pool seen. It probably in-spired Demi to marry Bruce and have his children! Not a typical action movie that you're accustomed to see Bruce in, but rather dramatic. Oh, by the way, he still had hair back then."
2,SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BLACK COMEDY,THIS FILM SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN ITSELF SO SERIOUSLY. THE THE FILMMAKERS SHOULD'VE MADE A BLACK COMEDY. MAYBE THE FILM WOULD'VE WORKED THEN.
2,"POORLY CONSTRUCTED,BUT UNINTENTIONALLY HILARIOUS","THIS FILM IS FAIRLY SUSPENSEFUL,BUT NOT VERY ENTERTAINING OR WELL-MADE. IT IS,HOWEVER,WORTH WATCHING FOR SOME UNINTENTIONALLY HILARIOPUS SCENES LIKE THE ONE WHERE BRUCE'S PSYCHOLOGIST FRIEND GETS KILLED. THAT SCENE IS A RIOT. COMEDY FANS:TAKE NOTE"
1,Preposterously bad.,"Color of Night is an erotic thriller that's inept in almost every regard. For those looking for something worthwhile to mention in this movie, the only two good things I can say is that Jane March is very good-looking and she can simulate an orgasm quite well. Everything else is silly and overblown. There's a plot twist at the end, but it's a bit predictable, and is more unpleasant than anything else when you think about it."
1,P.U.,"Odd mixture of Italian gallo & the standard direct-to-video erotic thriller that doesn't work on any level. Willis is the only one who seems to be halfway trying to act. The script was as bad as the fictional ""Beverly Hills Gun Club"" on ACTION, but without the irony. Scott Bakula's acting (especially his death scene) was so awful I hope it was intended as a salute to Argento's DEEP RED, rather than the unintentional humor it appears to be. Thank goodness for PULP FICTION, 12 MONKEYS & SIXTH SENSE, otherwise Bruce would still be living this one down."
2,Color of Night is Murky.,"A thriller that is highlighted only by the sensual heat of actress Jane March. The rest is awful. Early on in the film, the average movie goer can all ready pick out Jane March as one of Bruce Willis' group psych therapy patients disguised as a man. Therefore, we know right off the bat that she's behind all the evil going on. Leslie Ann Warren and Scott Bakula are wasted talents and it deserved its nomination of one of the worst films of 1994."
4,See Bruce Willis Naked!!,"Two lovers. One killer. Five suspects. Bruce Willis is a troubled psychiatrist who quits after a patient commits suicide. But when a colleague is murdered, Willis gets drawn into web of intrigue -- and into the arms of a patient (Jane March) who's also a suspect! The DVD contains 17 minutes of deleted scenes (including Willis in the buff)- That alone is worth the price of the DVD."
5,One of my fave Bruce movies,"Ladies, if you love Bruce Willis this is for you. For the person who said he wasn't he shape? WHAT? He looked great! I thought the movie was really good and he and Jane March made a pretty good team."
1,Overdeveloped Porn or Underdeveloped Movie?,Although I'm usually partial to nudity- partial or Full frontal- this movie really didn't - er- evoke the feeling I expected it to- this movie is terrible- the acting is garbage- and although Jane March was nice eye candy-It was pretty obvious from the first scene- this movie is bad-I do like the endtitle song though.If you're interested in this movie- avoid the plot and the acting- and the script- if you want a naked Jane March- or a naked Bruce Willis- you got the right movie- if your looking for anything else- watch Dude! Where's My Car- otherwise - stay away from this one
2,Stupid Movie,"What a stupid movie; the only redeeming quality is Ruben Blades. I'm a psychologist and this movie is completely improbable. The sound is terrible, too. Don't bother."
4,it pretty good,"a good who done it/thriller movie. there is extreme sex in this film which places it in an nc-17 rating. u get to see some violence, thrills, action sequence, people who have problems, a jackass detective, male and female nudity. its also recommended if u want to see bruce willis cock."
1,"so bad, i had to review it twice","Hmmm. Willis/Warren/Bakula/Henricksen: great actors...could've been an excellent movie...if it weren't for the script, the score and one horrible casting choice. I wish I could say that this was at least a guilty pleasure but, I can't. In order for it to qualify as a guilty pleasure, it would have had to have been laughable. But, we're being begged to take this silly movie seriously (just listen to the clawingly sappy score.) They could've achieved laughable by recasting the entire movie so that all of the actor's were of the same caliber as Jane March...and normally, I wouldn't stoop to attacking someone's looks but, since I can't see how else she would've gotten this role, I will...How DO all those teeth fit in her head anyway? Two words: Freddie Mercury."
2,Poor quality,"broke as I hooked it up to my electric drum kit, three of them at first now only three out of eight work. I don't recommend this item pay a lil more get what you want."
4,a great star trek book,"The story is an excellent one. There are some interesting moments included in this book. I liked Thompson's treatment of the characters Worf, Geordi, Picard and Riker."
3,Good hands on training but poorly bound.,I found this book to be very good in content especially for a beginner in Dreamweaver. The only drawback is that the book itself is not bound well. It literally fell apart very quickly after I received it with multiple groups of pages breaking away from the binding! I'm going to have to hole punch the pages and put them into a ring binder.
3,Dreamweaver,"The book material itself is fantastic and unbelievably easy to follow and understand. The craftmanship, if you will, of the book sucks. It literally started falling apart at the binding within 2 days of receiving it. I am not rough on the book by any means and do not transport it. It stays on my desk and I use it during my lunch hour. It has fallen apart and I have to keep a huge binder clip on it to keep all the pages intact."
4,Good Beginner's Guide to Dreamweaver,"I find this book to be very straightforward and user-friendly. It was the one required by the online class I am taking, so there was no ""shopping around"" for others; nevertheless, I might easily have chosen this one for it's clean layout and interactive exercises (on disk)."
3,Ok if you like tutorials and not question and answer.,"When i look at a book for a computer program such as dreamweaver, photoshop, flash, illustrator, quarx etc... I want to be able for the book to answer any of my specific questions I come against. This book creates tutorials to follow step by step to make your website look like the example website, but it doesn't have a good index or reference section that will just answer questions that one may come upon. I think there could be a better dreamweaver book out there."
4,Not bad,"Even though all the websites are pre-designed, this book is an overall must buy for anyone completely new to Dreamweaver."
4,Dreamweaver training,"This series of manuals, not just the book, is a good, almost great resource. The CD files provide great additional impact."
4,Great Teaching Material,"I used this book for many years when teaching a Web Design and Digital Media course at my local university. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the binding is terrible and, if you're a beginner to web design, you'll find yourself going through the exercises without really knowing why. Unfortunately, the book also only gives you hands on practice on one fake site rather than showing how several different options and letting you apply them from scratch to your website. Other than that, it is a fantastic step-by-step training guide with minimal errors and helpful videos that expand on the material in the book."
2,"Can follow lessons, can't work independently","OK, so I'm half-way through Chapter 15 and this book frustrates me. I'm on a Mac, so that offsets the instructions by one jog. It doesn't help, either, when Mac instructions are given incorrectly, or not given at all.Most of my software learning has been from books, not classes. This is my first experience of being able to follow exercises, but then not being able to work on my own. There is no sense of where to begin to build a practice site. For my style of learning, it is not helpful to be shown one way to do something, then to be told, ""Don't do it that way. Here's a better way.""I'll work the lessons through to the end even though the time spent feels partially wasted. Then, I'll try another book.I would not recommend this book to others."
5,Not bad for a cheap strap,"It has no bells or whistles, it's just a cheap strap that's well made. I recently got a new guitar and needed a new strap. The color almost matches my guitar and the price was just right. I've played with it on for a couple of hours and I never got tired with it. All in all it does what it supposed to do and has great build quality!"
3,OPI Not so Bora Bora Nail Polish,Can't understand why we can't get this stuff sent to a Military APO in Germany. Had to send to family to forward to us at an extra expense. Not Good!!!!
3,Not quite a perfect fit,"These are very general fit mats. They are good quality, but I wish they fit the floor better."
3,Weak Around the Edges,I love books about small business and was drawn to this more from the title than anything else. While it offers some solid advice I find in lacking overall. It doesnt follow any pattern of where to look for what and is more a random sampling of tips. Its not bad but not what I guess I expected and find it average at best.
4,big biz,Jeffery fox gives some good ideas that will basically work with any type of business. ideas can be adapted to suit your ideas and plans
5,* * Buy for your business friends * *,"Although some have criticized this book as being too simple, I find it makes a great summary of the important things a small entrepreneur must do.It doesn't take too long to read but it contains lots of practical advice. I underlined mine heavily.This book is also appropriate as a gift to friends that are starting their own company.The most important points that I derived from this book were Fox's lists of things to do, and their priorities. I highly recommend this book, and all the rest by Jeffrey J. Fox. He's become one of my favorite business writers.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
5,"If Your in Your Own Business, Read This Book","Jeffrey Fox writes the best how-to manuals out there. The problem is many people see his books more as entertaining advice instead of steadfast instruction.Read this book as a how-to. Develop ACTION steps with each chapter. Take notes in the margins, highlight key points. Then, follow the action steps you created from Jeffrey Fox's ideas.You will be better in your small business the very next day if you follow the sage advice in this book."
5,Buy it for the B-side,"Love is Stong is a very good, radio friendly song and I think one of the better ones on the ""Voodoo Lounge"" album. However, if you shopping for this, then you already have the album.So the reason you purchase this CD single is it's b-side: The Storm. Just about all the material from Voodoo Lounge is great. It was a very creative and diverse period for them. Just because this song wasn't on the album, doesn't mean it isn't good. It just didn't fit into the basic sound they were trying to achieve on the album. This is a straight forward delta blues number and very enjoyable. Stones fans won't be disappointed. Buy it!The remixes aren't too bad either."
4,Early Jeff Foxworthy -- needs maturing,"I watched a Comedy special with Jeff Foxworthy that was filmed in the early 2000s before I bought this DVD. He and his routines had matured over time, just like a good wine, and I think that show is much better. (Jeff's kids are teenagers now, not newborns, and he's got a hilarious routine about the womenfolk trying to get ready for church -- and he decides to make himself comfortable since it's more likely than not that the family would miss the service.) Please, Jeff and Showtime Productions, release that show on DVD!The Totally Committed DVD is early Jeff Foxworthy, still good, and you can see what all the fuss was about."
4,Jeff Foxworthy delivers Laughs,"When you get a Jeff Foxworthy Comedy video he delivers the laughter. The entire family can enjoy this comedy as it is not R-rated like many other comedians. Nothing wrong with R-rated but Foxworthy provides laughs without the hardcore language or body motions many comedians must use to get you laughing. This ""good ol' boy"" humor is fun,clean & intelligent.You don't even have to be Southern to find this Redneck humor amusing. You may not laugh out loud at everything but it's worth the money & time to enjoy it. His best efforts by far are: ""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" which is on dvd & vhs and ""You might be a Redneck if""."
4,Good for the Married Couples,"Jeff Foxworthy as all might know is extremely proud of his red-neck upbringing and his on-going relationship with the red-neck community. However, this particular skit was hilarious for the married couple. It was a definite good buy, especially since I got it for 50% off during the holiday season.This CD is excellent to share with your spouse on a weekend night together. Constantly sharing laughs all the way through."
3,"Wearable..""","The leather is a bit hard, hurts my big toe. Also, to shoe is not so cute in peropson, but it is wearable."
5,What a treasure!,"Its hard to find a book that makes me laugh as much as my toddler, but this is one! I instantly fell in love with it. It has great lines, and beautiful illustrations. Best of all is the ending. You will love this book, too."
5,Such good books are hard to find,"We received this book as a gift from family in Australia. From the first reading our son (16 months) LOVES this book. The little wombat goes through small little adventures explaining why he likes to certain things, like jumping as he can ""to see how much noise he can make when he lands."" Our son's favorite part is when little wombat sticks out his tongue and makes funny faces, he then also pokes out his tongue (very cute!) The book is brightly illustrated with easily recognizable Australian animals and supported with short uncomplicated text, which is the perfect length for our impatient listener ;). We believe that this book is a MUST HAVE for all little libraries"
5,The Greatest,This book has been perfect since my daughter was born. At 11 months she loved to copy the faces (sticking out her tongue) and now she's 18 months now and loves to point out all the animals. Plus it's my favorite!
4,Cute short read,"I bought this book for my 2 1/2 year old son and he enjoyed it. The pictures were clear, and vibrant and the writing flowed rhythmically. Kept my son's attention which is hard to do so it's a keeper!"
3,disappointed in price point,"While the book itself is fine, well made and good content, I was disappointed in the total cost. I would have purchased the large book at a bookstore for $12.95 but the one copy was ripped and the time element to order another to be picked up made it impossible. Instead, I ordered the smaller version from Amazon but the cost of shipping made it almost as expensive as the larger one.Next time, I'll give myself more time to purchase."
2,All the ingredients but no formula,"I don't recommend this book, and wish I hadn't bought it. It is unstructured and unorganized in it's deliverance of information.It does not give a complete list of common gym exercises, nor a diagram of the human muscle anatomy for reference and application.This book leaves many questions unanswered or vaguely answered.The subject matter jumps around alot, giving tidbits of information as you read through.The author just didn't carry the ball all the way on this one.Luckily enough I found a better book that really outlines it all as well as giving a real periodization structure to create my progressive workout routine."
4,Good for Beginner/Intermediate,"All-and-all a very good book for weight lifters who have had some experience with basic weight lifting ideas and terms. Although has some(re: kinda a lot) of editing mistakes, it makes up for it with very good ideas about training. I would recommend it with another book like perhaps Designing Resistance Programs(Kraemer & Fleck) or some other periodization text, it can, however, stand alone. All said and done a must buy"
2,Okay at best,"For the most part, I think that the principles were elementary; which was good for me. This book wasn't an easy reader. It was a bit confusing and I would have liked a more precise explaination of any one topic. For a general reference this book is excellent. The title is definitely a bold statement. It should have been more like ""The polYquin see your other references."""
2,too much money for what you get.,"THE BOOK IT TOO MUCH MONEY FOR WHAT YOU GET! LOOK ELSE WHERE!!!It would be an great 30$ or 40$ soft cover, but I believe the rarity & reputation is what a person is really paying for when he/she buys this book. Since price is the most important issue I gave a low score.If I were to rate solely on the books contents ""4"".PRO-will help you add variety to your work out-will help you understand difference between strength gain, strength/mass gain, and mass gain.- has lots of information on different muscle types and the best way to train them.-the exercise that are explained have detailed form information.- I like the line art pictorials, simple and informative.CON-If you are unfamiliar with exercise names you may need to do research just to find out what exercise the guy is refering to. This doesn't apply to ones that are explained.-an index would have been nice.-less pictures of bodybuilding stars, and more of proper exercise form."
1,This book is the pits.,"The writing is poorly organized and full of obscure references and cheep shots at other strength trainers. The photos are bad and the only athletes Poloquin admits to training are tiny. The paper is cheap and the printing is bad. If you are not already a world class lifter looking for an edge, don't waste your money."
2,expected more professionalism,"I really enjoy poliquins monthly articles in Iron man and on T-nation, he is a very intelligent man with a world of knowledge to share, but that is not whats really displayed in this writing. atleast every 3rd page has personal attacks at mike mentzer, arthur jones, ellington darden, the weiders, ect. reguardless of what he thinks of these individuals he should not so childlessly voice his personal opinion on them so often. when I went to UIW, I was there to learn athletic training and that is what the proffesors taught me, they didnt waste all MY time bashing on all these coaches and methods they didnt like, and this is exactly what is displayed here. if not for so much trash talking, more structure, a better layout, some of the info in book would be pretty good."
4,Reference book.,"This book is very useful to learn how to understand the science of building a training that suits your needs and your goals. You take what you want from it! I've owned it since it came out and i'm still refering to it! This is basic, simple information to every body who wants to get serious in their training! Thanks coach Poliquin!"
3,"Small, Small, Small","This toy is very small, please check sizes when ordering....I should have known better than to assume the washer was bigger, but learned a lesson..."
5,Better than i expected,"This is a good cd. It's got lots of bass, good beats, and tight rappin. Oh yeah, it's even got all of those og's from death row that everyone loves. My friends told me this cd wasn't very good, but i bought it anyway and it's way better than i thought it would be. The best tracks are 4 and 5."
5,nicceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!,this is an awesome cd. i don't know what is wrong with those who think it not. i recommend you get. im a west coast rapper liker and it gots some of both east and west plus it gots good lyrics and beats. gett ittt!
5,I WANT IT ALL! FOR SURE I WANT THIS CD!,"WARREN G IS GETTING EACH TIME BETTER! IN MY OPINION HE WAS VERY INSPIRED WHILE HE WAS RECORDING IT, BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY GREAT. FOR SURE THE BEST SONG IS ' I WANT IT ALL' , THEN 'DOPE BEAT' AND FINALLY 'GANGSTA LOVE'. IT WAS A GREAT JOB OF WARREN G . WHEN I LISTEN TO THIS CD I FEEL LIKE DANCIN' AND IT SEEMS THAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO STOP. WARREN G & HIP-HOP= IT COULDN'T BE BETTER!"
5,this is one good cd,"this is a great cd,i suggest that you add it to your collection, especially if you are a fan of warren g, nate dogg, or snoop. even though hes with no limit he performs well on this cd. the good songs are 3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13, 16. and probably more. buy it"
2,Try Again!!!!,"Warren G is very similiar to Puff Daddy in his rapping style. He is better at producing and making beats. I think this album is descent, but more was expected from his third album release. He needs to stop trippin' and bring out the 5 Footaz(the group he contemplated to sign). Is he waiting for them to grow to six feet. 5 Footaz would put him back on top of his game."
1,baddddddddddddd!,"this disc is so boring, and where did those ruff ryders come from (straight from the garbage). warren just sold out and decided to make a no effort album. He knew that everyone would pick it up, especially the bandwagon jumpers. The artists featuring on it didn't even improve most of the songs. the worst song on this disc is the ruff ryder song, they have no skills. i don't even think that pawn shops would accept this, I will proberly have to pay someone to take this away. i repeat bad and not even close to his previous albums. If you liked this album you won't like the others. should have talked about more pants and hats."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This has to be about the worst CD I ever wasted my money on. The reason I got this CD was because the song with Mac 10 was pretty good on the radio, but when I listened to the whole CD, everything else was garbage. I was expecting Warren G to have some hard songs, considering he raps with Snoop, Daz, Mac 10, and others..but this CD doesn't even come close! Unless you like slow song/ love music...FORGET IT!"
3,Not true G-Funk,"On this new record, Warren concentrates too much on other artists and doesn't focus enough on the G-Funk styles that we all love. On the few songs that feature only Warren and other members of the original G-Funk Era, this album is excellent. ""Dope Beat"" is the G-Child at his best, dropping funky rhymes similar to his older song ""And ya dont stop."" The best song is ""The Game Dont Wait,"" featuring Warren, Snoop, and Nate Dogg, the original 213 singing and rapping about how they have come up as 3 young G's and now are kickin it. ""You never Know"" starts out strong with G and Snoop's tight, laid-back ryhmes, but then Reel Tight comes in with a lousy, in-yo-face rant that ruins the feel of the song. Bottom Line -- Most of the songs are weak because they have too many mediocre rappers, but the album is still worth having for the true G-Funk fan because of the amazing ""Game Dont Wait."""
5,cd of tha year,"i new this cd would be dope so i pre-ordered it and this is definetly a great cd......smooth beats, tight lyrics, and the guests are good too.......buy it if you get the chance"
4,he's still got it,"The G child is all grown up and while this LP doesn't quite live up to G-Funk Era he still made a very good piece of work. His beats are better than most of the rappers out there and its nice to see he's still runnin' with Snoop and Nate. Some of the lyrics could use some work( like when he repeats ""remember what you told yourself nigga"" four times in I Want It All). And I wish he'd try to do something on the ruff ryders track instead of just blabing at the end of the song. I dont mean to dog on the album because it really is worth your fifteen bucks and Warren can still lace a phat beat."
4,G-Funk is still the ERA,Hey Warren I tell you I am not a big rap fan...but I tell you that world wide ryder is the joint...along with the hook-up with the ruff ryder crew...u are keeping it real...peace
5,This is one of the top cd's in my 300 plus collection,"For all you out there, you must get this cd. It's got awesome hits and tight lyrics. It'll surely be in your player 24/7. Warren G surely has put all his heart into this album, be the first to buy...and the first to know all the tracks before it hits the radio hard. Gonna be one of the best cd's this year!"
4,westsiiide,"he's back! better than ever, my homeboy from wayback.the LBC is putting it down once again. the class of 89-91' long beach poly high alumni are putting it down from snoop to cameron diaz!!!"
2,very so-so,when warren is bumping with snoop&nate it's on but this disc goes all over the place.sounding just like factory product and not up to warren g's depth.he has and can do better work than this.
3,Pleasant Way to Pass Some Time,"I've never read anything by Evelyn Anthony before. I found Bloodstones to be enjoyable, though not necessarily great or compelling. I did appreciate her talent in creating interesting characters and in telling her story in such a way that it was not obvious how it would end. At times I found it difficult to keep track of the numerous characters in this story. Overall I would say Bloodstones was a good but not a great read."
2,Who Can Categorize this Book?,"It seemed like an intriguing concept when I read the front and back covers; something like either a James Elroy novel or Sidney Kirkpatrick's excellent ""A Cast of Killers."" Instead, this story goes back and forth and beyond -- part mystery, part horror story, part apocryphal Hollywood tell-all, part semi-documentation of the dangers of all too-intense hero worship -- and at the end of it, there is no sense of WHICH genre it falls into, thus making it a very muddled and confusing read."
2,Ok second World War ra ra marine movie,"Interesting footage, flag waving patriotism, pick the future star movie of Marine landing on Japanese held island, but little suspense."
5,"Olde', but Goody","An epic olde'..must have for your collection!..Richard Widmark at his finest along with Jack Palance, Karl Malden Richard Boone and JackWebb."
4,Halls Of Montezuma,"The acting and action in this film were topnoitch. Somewhat dated, but still very interesting. Recommend this film for those who served in the armed forces."
4,Realistic Equipment,Movie used actual sherman tanks and actual amtracks. Arrived quickly and color reproduction and picture quality is pretty good considering this movie is 60 years old. Presented in full screen.
5,A great single !!,Christian Davis is the coolest new artist. He's so soulful and sexy looking. I can't wait for his album to come out. He's gonna be a big star. All of my friends love the song Safe In The Arms Of Love.
5,Solid Clamp,"Experienced woodworker.The best clamp I've ever used on any miter saw I've put my hands on (many). The easiest to use, solid clamping.They are not used frequently, but because it is so quick to set-up, I use it. My old ones I tried (on other saws) and got so frustrated, I never used them. Great Saw and great clamp."
2,They don't stock this sink!,"I ordered this sink and they sent the wrong sink. I give them an extra star because they refunded the entire amount promptly and let me keep the sink they shipped, but they told me they would remove this listing, since they do not stock this model. So why is the same wrong sink listed for sale when they can't fill orders for it?"
1,IST Shaker Bottle,"Id rate them a Negative 5 stars if that were possible, they did not ship the right cup. I am extremely frustrated because I am currently deployed to Iraq and cant just go to the store and buy the right cup. If a seller is going to advertise a product they should see to it that the product advertised and purchased is the one sent, not some cheap knock off to save a few bucks. especially when I have to pay like 30 freaking bucks to have it shipped to me. these guys suck. don't buy from them, we'll see how the customer service department handles themselves and they may earn a better review"
3,bad compmay!,this isn't a great wody allen flick. this is hte second one of this flicks that i'vz seen but it wasn't that funny. thouygh woodyt did haze the best line sin th ehwooellfl;ick. some funy patsrs but npt enough to keep all foo my attention. if you like woody get it!...peace !
4,Hilarious!,"This movie is hilarious!The comedy isn't in disgusting acts but rather in the script. The main actor is a very funny character. The whole movie I was laughing throughout as they the script was very upbeat and always in tempo with what was going on screen. The acting was perfect with the script and all the actors did a great job portraying this movie.See this movie! Rent it or buy it see it for yourself, you will not be disappointed."
2,Saved by John Turturro's scenery-chewing,"Boy, I've been watching this movie for about a month this week, & I'm still in the first 90 minutes. Turturro is weird, which is why I like him, almost as weird as he was in Big Lebowski. Sigourney Weaver makes you want to sic an Alien on her. Dennis Leary is a throwaway here."
3,This is NOT Winsock programming!!!,"While attending VBits in San Fran, I purchased this book. I have long been looking for a way to circumvent all of MS's internet controls in favor of learning Winsock.DLL. (More power, less overhead). However, Winsock.DLL is a bear to deal with!Though the book contains lots of useful information and underlying principle, the book teaches a proprietary shareware DLL rather than Winsock.DLL. What I'd REALLY like is to see the book they authors read before they wrote their book."
3,Not What I Expected,"This book does have some basic information that introduces internet protocols and their functions, however, where I feel the book was a major disappointment was that it was specifically based on a third-party control and not Microsoft's Winsock control. This approach is very unorthodoxed and a programmer expects to use the controls available within the VB6 IDE. Consequently, having to use (especially a non-registered control that is very annoying) a third-party control doesn't require a fourth-party book to show you how to use it, but to simply use the programmer's guide and their web site source code examples when purchasing the control. The bottom-line is; I would have preferred using examples straight from the WinSock (which I have now purchased another book from MS). Sorry Carl but I don't agree with your approach but still like your web site."
1,"Terrible Book, Buggy Code Samples","For an introduction to Internet programming techniques, this book is too narrowly focussed. It only covers and implements a proprietary Internet control completely ignoring Wininet and Winsock. On top of this the code samples are extremely buggy and are not supported by the author's VB website! Avoid at this price, might be useful at bargain basement prices only as alearning exercise in debugging terrible code."
1,Dissappointing to say the Least,"Despite the considerable credentials of the author, this book provides very little useful information. All too often it seems, every code example used, every discussion broached evolves around a separate plug in. I certainly didn't expect a 400 page advertisement. Neither should you."
1,How To Use Third Party Controls,"I can't believe I spent $ to learn how to use Dolphin System's OCX control. Now I'd have to shell out another $100 if I want to use the OCX without the annoying splash screen. This is the worst case of fraud as you have to slip through TWENTY-FIVE pages before you're told the book is based on a third-party shareware tool.If you must use an OCX control, buy it from the developer directly and save yourself the $ for this book."
1,Title should read - How to Use a Proprietary Control in VB6,"Not what I expected at all. The first part of the book was okay - the history and building of the internet. The rest of the book - including sample code - was a discussion of how to use the control the writer created. If you want to spend another $300+ to be able to do your own FTP application, this is the book for you. That's what it costs to buy the software that will allow the sample code to run."
1,Utterly worthless pile of rubbish,"This book should be retitled ""Internet Programming w/ VB 6.0 and a $200 Plug-In"". When I buy a book on Visual Basic programming, I expect to learn how to program using Visual Basic, not Visual Basic and some ActiveX plug-in made by a 3rd Party vendor that I have to buy separately (for $200). Don't buy it."
1,"If you run out of toilet page,use this book to finish wiping",I brought this good to learn how to use Winsock. What I receive was a dsWinsock control and a lecture from Carl about why he doesn't like WinSock. HEY CARL GET A GRIP. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
1,A Good background but based on proprietary VB control,"The book gave a great backgroung to FTP, ""user-unfriendly"" terms, buzzwords. Unfortunately, if you are looking for code that will assist you in developing your own application this may NOT be for you..."
4,A comprehensive coverage of interent programming using VB 6.,"While some programming gurus or people who have already read previous version of this book may find the material boring and redundant, this book is an excellent source for those wanting to master internet programming.The author cleverly uses an ActiveX control to give the audience solid working examples instead of lecturing in an academical manner.I reccomend this book to anyone who has beginning to intermediate Visual Basic exposure."
3,OK Fairport live album I'm surprised to find on CD,"I didn't know this was on CD. This live album was recorded during the period when Fairport was officially ""broken up"". It's a pretty mixed bag, with several cover tunes that go in wildly different directions: Dylan's ""Country Pie"", Judy Collins' ""Both Sides Now"", and Jerry Lee Lewis' ""High School Confidential"". Highlights include the best version I've heard of ""Poor Will and the Jolly Hangman"" and the Richard Thompson rarity ""Woman or a Man"" (it also appeared on his solo acoustic ""Small Town Romance"" album). The sound quality is not great.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,Memoir of the Julia Child of Chinese Cooking in America,"The memoir of the proprietor of San Francisco's highly regarded Mandarin Restaurant, the first to serve authentic Chinese food in America. It is said that she did for Asian cuisine what Julia Child did for French, and her fans included Child, James Beard, Alice Waters, and many others. This memoir mixes succulent recipes like Smoked Tea Duck with reminiscences of growing up in pre-World War II Peking to a family with vast wealth. They lost everything first as result of the Japanese occupation and later due to the Communist takeover. Book is poignant and exquisitely written, and the recipes are to die for."
4,Detailed illustrations and description,"The book is very detailed on the picture and descriptions. It provides with very good fixtures for different projects and it looks as a very useful reference. Still, it suggest the addition of some expensive blades and dadoes that may not be considered for you."
2,Size runs small,"I was pretty sure the Rockport name would guarantee that I would be satisfied. However, it seems you have to order - 1 size up. I ordered a size 6 .... my normal size ... but it was smaller and narrower than a normal 6B or 6M. Could not return for a replacement since I was going out of the country at the time."
4,"Comfort, Comfort, Comfort!!!",I love these shoes they are my wear to work shoes for before I put on my heals. I get lots of compliments on them.
2,"Top heavy, hard to open, thin material","There is a hinge that opens the mouth that is difficult to open for my 6 y/o. I have to leave the mouth open 1/2"" so he can open himself. The picture shows you can pour liquids into it, I doubt the nylon mesh is woven tight enough to hold liquids. Good trash capacity but the hinged mouth opening is awkward and bulky."
3,Nifty little litter bag.,"This bag is a good sized and durable. It was easy to install. My only complaint is the ""hinges"" that are at the top, which are meant to keep the bag fully open, do not lock in the open position. Therefore, the only way to keep the bag open is once it is partially filled. On the plus side, it is waterproof and easy to clean."
3,Needs some work but good littler bag.,"Product is very well made. A small t-shirt grocery bag will fit inside without difficulty. I hooked mine around the headrest and turned it to face the back seat which works great in my vehicle. However, mine does not open and shut properly. It seems to stay mid-close and is very frustrating to open up. I think it is a good idea but needs a little work.UPDATE: I found this to be a very annoying litter bag. It will go in the trash itself next time I clean my car. It has never opened and shut correctly and the grocery bag liner idea is a joke. It will not stay in place. Not worth the annoyance."
2,Smaller then expected,No one to blame but myself. It is small and not what I had hoped for or was expecting. I should have just returned it but for the price it just was not worth the effort.
1,Poor design and construction.,"Product failed in less than two months. Poor design with multiple seams, which are heat sealed. A bottom seam failed in less than two months. Find a better brand, don't waste your money on this. I have other brand trash bags which have lasted over 10 years without failure."
5,litter bag,So many of the new cars don't have lighters in them which is where I used to hang my plastic litter bag that you get at the car washes. There is absolutely no place to hang them in cars now. This litter bag is perfect and it holds a lot too.
4,Wonderful!,"I purchased this trash can to keep my car clean, but it stated that it was water proof. It came with holes in the bottom, but I don't intend on putting liquid in it so that didn't really affect me at all. Love how easy it is to open and close."
2,deceptive size,"this is a well-made, solid trash container. The problem is, the photo on the front of the package has been photoshopped to indicated it is a lot larger than it really is. It's deceptive. We didn't really have a need for such a small receptacle so we had to send it back. Look at the actual dimensions listed, NOT the picture, to determine if this is the right size for you."
1,"Looks good, but not made well","It is a great idea. Unfortunately, I had to throw it out after only having it 3 months because it ripped at the seam. The material looked nice and sturdy but the seams are just a thin vinyl and obviously tears easily there."
4,Nice bag for litter,"This is a nicely made bag to help keep the litter in my car under control. Had no problem hooking it around the headrest behind the seat. It is a sturdy bag, but I wish it would stay open a little better than it does. It seems like when I am ready to put something in the bag, it tends to close a little bit making it harder to place trash in it. All in all, it is a nice bag and keeps my car litter free."
2,"Great concept, poor quality","I searched hard to find this product and it looked perfect. The closing lid to hide the garbage was a big plus, but also it's weakness. The metal frame fell apart, poked through the fabric, and the tear has now continued down the side making it unusable. Not well constructed, and was way overpriced when I bought it. My 10 year old daughter could have sewed me a stronger bag. Only lasted about 3 months."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this trash can for my kids to put their trash in. It lasted about 3 months before the metal became all bent and poking out of the canvas. I've since replaced it with withHighland 1932600 Car Trash Keeper, so far so good."
4,"A well written, fair look at teacher contracts","This is certainly a wonkish book; when you have chapters with more than 100 citations, you've almost certainly written something scholarly. For anyone interested in in teachers unions and collective bargaining, though, this is a very important book. The chapters by Frederick Hess and Dan Goldhaber especially add important elements to the discussion, and the flow to the book as a whole makes sense. I mark it down slightly because of some dull spots (the chapter by Paul Hill, for example, isn't needed), but it's still recommended."
4,5 Beatles from Liverpool,"If you are a Beatle fan buy it if you can find it.This is the story about how 5 Liverpool Lads gets a job inHamburg, and goes to big fame.The story is told by their first manager, with a nice sense of humor.A single fact isn't correct, is wasn't Paul and George who went to jailin Hamburg but Paul and Pete.This book is also mentioned at The Beatles Story in Liverpool, and it istold that John has read it and had a good laugh.It also tells how the world got to know the Live Star Club Recordings fromHamburg just before the Fab Four became very big.Buy it."
3,A must for any true Beatles fan,"A history of the early Beatles, seen through the biased eyes of the man who managed and lost them. Humerous and with the wit that only the Liverpool of the 60's could give. A must for any true Beatles fan!"
2,Too large for the size,"Shoes are OK but is actually quite larger than the size10XX I always wear, my foot is so loose around in the shoes that I have to return it. Thanks to Amazon they handle my return nicely."
2,Atinze Mwana Popi,"Atinze Mwana Popi, is unique in its own way. Those who know Grand Yampanya from the early eighties know this CD can not miss in their collection. Where do we get 'Adieu Leah'. These two CDs always flow together in my mind...real nostalgia fused...I will always miss Kalles husky voice."
2,The Slip?,"I bought this CD for the first 2 songs in hopes the rest of the CD would be equally as good. It's not. After repeated listening, the CD runs out of steam quickly."
2,"Not what I expected, mostly British items","There are lots of footnotes, quotes, references. He can back up what he says.However, this book is NOT a combat chronicle. Is is mostly about the politics, planning, back-biting, second-guessing that went on at the command level. It is also mostly about the British troops, and about Montgomery. The American forces in Normandy are mentioned here & there in passing.Compared to the Stephen Ambrose style, I found this tome too focused on command, the British, and kinda boring."
2,D'Este rides again - fairly sloppy research lacks balance,"Whilst D'Este writes a good story, although at times this one moves somewhat slowly, he remains unable to produce a work of great significance. Unfortunately, he allows his dislike of Montgomery to color his work, and an ex-army officer who should know better than that. Whether D'Este likes it or not, there is no Allied Commander with a battle-to-win ratio that touches Mongomery. He was not Manstein, but was a steady hand, and sadly D'Este's selective research, based on a personal bias that appears is his other equally poorly resarched books, fails to take this into account.This book is a good read, but its conclusions are 'different.' Remembering that no one ever makes good money without finding something new to sell, D'Este's approach is understandable but less than professionally commendable."
3,CONFUSSING,"I really enjoy this author and his wonderful writing style and I have read his excellent works on Patton and Eisenhower, but frankly this book confuses me. The author spent the entire book commenting on how Montgomery failed in his mission caused mostly by his personality, tactics and inability to take opportunities when presented. Then, he spends the last part of the book defending Montgromery, making excuses for him, etc. The author can't have it both ways. When I first purchased this book I thought it would detail the Normany landings, but instead it was devoted to Montgomery and his failings.In the end, we just don't really understand Monty and the author sets about telling us why. I have yet to read anything that would ever lead me to believe that Montgomery was anything but a pompous, arrogant, self serving Ass, that would do anything to hold a grudge and defend his poor showing as a commander."
5,Really is the Ultimate Book,"This book has it all. Great pictures, easy to understand directions, and out of this world receipes. If you are looking to amaze w/your creations, then this is the one for you!!!!!"
4,Full of nice Photo!!!,"I've read this book,so I want to share my ideas.This book is good,full of photo and basic techniques,step-by-step.A lot of traditional recipes.Informations about ingredients is good-looking.But not much tips for beginners.Anyway,it's beautiful for reading."
3,Still a good account of BR,"Considering that there is not much else out there, this book is still the best on Bacon's Rebellion. Only Ed Morgan's several chapters on BR in ""American Slavery, American Freedom"" cover the topic. The main problem with this book is that there's no ""feel"" for Va at the time. There's no setting, atmosphere, or depth to the culture, the landscape, the people, the delegates, or the environment. It is straight up political narrative."
5,Great for imaginative play,"I purchased this product for my 3 yr. old son at Christmas. He loves pretending and his little sister get in on it too. This product is high quality, as I have found all of my purchases of Melissa & Doug products to be. This keeps him entertained and boosts his imagination at the same time."
5,Mesmerizing,"Here's a tale of a mysterious beautiful item called the Dragon Glass, which was looted by a man named Herndon, from the Forbiddened City, where he found the mysterious item accidentally. At first all he could see was the beautiful built of the glass itself, the frame exotically decorated with gems and orientated pictures.One day at home, he was found nowhere within his mansion and much panick they inform a friend of his, only to reappeared around a week later, wounded. They finally decided to let his friend to talk to Herndon since he seemed to be too traumatised to talk to anybody about his disappearance.It was then when they were alone at last, he finally revealed that he went through the dragon glass, where he met a mysterious female in a strange place and where he meet the mysterious Wonder-Worker"
2,Read a better written memoir...,"While Muller's account is an emotional portrayal of the horrors of Auschwitz, his excessive use of adjectives and repetitive narration makes his account somewhat difficult to get through. He talks us through many of the horrid details of the selections and gassings, but his redundancy ends up slightly immuning you to the plight of the victims. I liken this immunity to that which much of the world has acquired toward violence. The one excellent aspect of this book is the inside look into the actions of the Sonderkammando squad and the events of the uprising that led to the burning of crematiorium 4.A much better written memoir is Primo Levi's ""Survival in Auschwitz,"" a truly chilling account of the Auschwitz experience. Every word carries a weight that drives home the inhumanity of the concentration/death camps without overdoing it."
3,decent read,"This book has some very interesting information in it, and is a very distinct story from other Holocaust survivors. However, it's not really for the casual reader. The narrative jumps around significantly, which I assume is due to how the author remembers it, but it does make it a bit difficult to follow at times.I would recommend it for those who are interested in an unique perspective of the crematoria and Holocaust historians."
5,Detailed and Heartrending,Mr. Muller's account is detailed and heartrending. He articulately captures the full range of his awful experience. A must-read for any student of this terrible period in history.
4,Good read.,Book arrived quickly and in excellent condition as advertised.The story line is interesting and gives a unique perspective intothe horrible existence led by the members of the sonderkommando within the Germanconcentration camps during WWII.
5,"Gripping, First Hand Account of Life in Auschwitz","A powerful, ominous, and heart wrenching account of life in the confines of Auschwitz from 1942-1944. Well-written and extremely detailed description of the extermination camp that claimed the lives of more than one million people. Highly recommended!"
5,Descent into hell,"This is one of the few books I have read on the Holocaust that takes the reader to a depth of un-imaginable horror. Filip Muller takes you on his life story up to and including his stay at Auschwitz-Birkenau with riveting detail and accuracy. The chapter titled ""The Inferno"" was the hardest to read, let alone envision. I have seen actual photos of the ""pits"" as Muller describes them, yet the reality of the ghastly work he was forced to do cannot come through in words. I would cautiously recommend this to any serious student of Holocaust history."
2,Not for me,"I can see how, in the eyes of some people, this book could be a great work of art. I can understand it. But it is definitely NOT for me. I just couldn't get over how naive and simple Natalia/Colometa was. The writing style (stream of conscious) was terrible. For the entire book I felt as though I was trapped inside the mind of a simple girl with simple thoughts. The end was pretty good, though. At least we can finally see her FEEL something. Anyway, I read it because I had to for summer reading. I'm definitely not planning on reading it again."
5,The Time of the Doves,"I read this book, and now I have to give a report on it. I found the people's reviews to be most helpful.(thank you!) I think the ""new"" title, ""The Time of the Doves"" now packs a bigger punch. I have been thinking a lot about the connection between the title and Natalia's (Colometa's) life and stream of thoughts. I can see how her life really was not peaceful. She struggled constantly to survive. The pivotal moment, I thought, was when she let out that scream in the Placa del Diamant near the end of the novel. I thought it sort of symbolized her letting go of all that had happened in her life. Does anyone else have anymore insights on this moment? Please comment back!Regardless, I really enjoyed the book. There was a nasty part about the tapeworm Quimet had that totally grossed me out! But the detail Rodereda writes is brilliant. ""The Time of the Doves"" is truly is a Catalan masterpiece."
5,Add to your holiday wishlist!,This is an absolute must have for any fan of classic film who refuses to let all those great facts disappear into obscurity. An absolute hit at any party!
1,.NET for Dummies should .NET BY Dummies,"Tons of errors, some don't even pass the simple syntax test.Example:Page 708 -str = ""Update Employees set Department = ""@DPT, & _& ""Description = @DSG where EmployeeID = @ID""Notice the use of & _ & at the end of the first and start of the second lines.

2,Visual Studio.net not for dummies,"The title of this tome is very misleading. I was expecting to find a guide to ease me slowly into the nomenclature and conventions of this very powerful software suite, but what I found was an advanced tip guide for intermediate users already familiar with version 6.0. Being a dummy myself in this field, I was very disappointed with my somewhat large investment in this guide. Also, it is not written in the plain, folksy manner that defines the best of this series. There's $35 I'll never get back. Definitely not for beginners!"
4,Visual Studio.Net All in One Desk Reference for Dummies,"Very good, has lot's of practicle examples. A must have"
5,What a great deal!!,These shoes are well worth the minimal investment. They are comfortable right out of the box. I'm pretty sure they won't last years and years but for the price who cares? I wear these pretty much every day to work; so they get lots of wear and they are still in great shape.
2,Sent wrong shoe is the mule box,"I was unhappy...I got a pair if loafers in the mule box. I am now waiting (almost a week now) for the return shipping label which they are sending in the mail. When I requested the correct shoe, they no longer had my size. The customer service lady was very nice and apologized. I still needed a shoe though. I did order a clog through same Shoemall. Hopefully, I will be able to give a better review when it arrives."
4,Un gran libro,"Este libro tiene una lectura extensa, densa, compleja y con un lenguaje muy coloquial, es decir, de la epocaGracias"
2,el conocido,"el libro clásico, no tiene ningún elemento especial adicional o diferenciador; si no lo ha leído, debería descargarlo y leerlo pues es un clásico de la literatura"
5,El Quijote,I read when I had 10 years old. It is a classic Spanish book. Excellent book. A jewel you should have in you collection.
5,Un clásico de la literatura mundial.,"Con esta gran obra nació la novela moderna en la voz y caracterización de personajes inolvidables. Don Quijote y su compañero Sancho han trascendido el papel. Es un gusto poder consultar una obra, leída y releída en otros años, a través de los nuevos medios digitales."
2,Never showed on my Mac Kindle,"I can only access this book on my Amazon account online, it never showed up on my Kindle on my Mac."
1,Want to read Tom Lathrop's Spanish edition of Don Quixote on Kindle?,"Well don't click on the link that purports to take you there so you can download it. Once again Amazon misleadingly links the wrong book as the Kindle version. Fortunately in this case it is a free version that is linked. Unfortunately, apparently Tom Lathrop's Spanish edition is not available on Kindle. Perhaps the formatting would be too difficult in terms of benefiting from the definitions he provides in the margin of the physical book. But at least his helpful footnotes could be linked. Lathrop's edition has made the Spanish more readable for those for whom Spanish is not their native tongue, because it removes some of the archaic Spanish for a more modern reading-- great for students of the language.The one star is to draw attention to the fact that the product is not at all what is featured on the screen."
1,Not Spanish speaking,my mistake - didn't read it because I can't read Spanish. I Will read the English version in the future.
5,Clasico,Un libro muy viejo pero que vale la pena leerlo. Sus historias y mensajes todavía son vigentes y válidos en las vida actual.
5,excellent,"excellent, it was qick, i got on timevery nice and responsable.thanks for your product , i will recomended"
5,Excellent,"Una gran historia hispanoamericana por parte de Miguel Cervantes de Saavedra. No la leí en el colegio, ahora tocará leerla."
1,Muy mal maquetado,"Gratis, pero dificil de leer. No merece la pena. No hay formato, separaciones de capitulos... Buscaré alternativas aunque sean de pago."
2,"Nice examples, no substance","Like in many business books the authors present their message in a number of examples, each describing how a group managed to do something clearly outstanding. The problem of the book is that the authors do not manage to come up with anything like a coherent framework to explain the success of these groups. Examples are only useful if they show the working of some underlying general principle. In this book, however, examples simply stand for themselves. The stories are nicely written and it is fun to read, but it certainly does not present a theory of successful teams. But maybe, as an academic economist, I am too demanding in this respect."
1,"Dissappoint, a voyeurs view of effective teams","The book is a review of other books and as such provides little insight into its title. The book is poorly structured with examples repeating each other to the point that it looked like the authors were tyring to fill up the pages rather than write a cogent arguement. In addition, Bennis goes for the cheap when he repeatedly discusses the ""sexual:"" tensions that existed on these teams. I'd rather he focused on their dynanmics and how they were maintained than people's personal lives. If that doesn't discourage you from the book, this will, most of these teams were formed over 30 years ago. This offers little advice or guidance on dealing with building teams of gen-Xers ect. That was my reason for reading the work."
5,Profound lessons filter through,"The mosaic of anecdote, observation and quotation all get close to the smell and feel of the elusive quality of great teams. Because every team is different the conclusions are hard to package definitively, but there was more than enough here for me to advance my own understanding a significant degree, and to put concrete lessons I derived into practice. Also, the bibliography is interesting in itself. It only takes a couple of days to read, but as they say, it makes ya think."
2,Redundancy leads to confusion and lack of interest,"I have read many of this author's books, and I was very dissappointed in this one. The author starts off with a good premise and tells us he is going to look at a very important topic. However, the chapters do not seems to flow together as he keeps returning to the stubject of a previous chapter to make a point about the current chapter (company). I would not recommend this book."
5,Geometry to Go,"I have kept this book by my side as I assist students study for the SATs. It is easy to read, puts terms in words low level readers understand and the pictures also add to the understanding. It is definately worth the money."
4,Holiday mailing list,very happy with the time that i received my CD and it was better then paying the full price to replace the disk that I allready had but missed placed.My Holiday Mailing Labels
5,infancy,the book is quite informative and it will help you understand your infant and what to expect from the little one.
2,a dreadful book,"This book is a book were you can't get into it. It is like you are reading a law book. The plot seems like it would be good, but it is not! It has a good story but it is very repeatitive. The only reason why to buy this book is that you need it to complete the saga."
5,EXCELLENT TREK,"""Harvest"" is a fantastic conclusion to this two part story. It is full of the kind of excitment that those of us who love Trek expect. This novel takes off at breakneck speed and does a wonderful job at tying a TV episode to itself as well. It gives a great plot and offers yet another look at the ""Next Generation"" crew in the kind of fantastic action that fans have come to love. I highly recommend this novel along with its predecessor ""A Time To Sow."""
5,A must read!,"I've read other Star Trek TNG books and by a host of other authors. However, in this book and ""A Time to Sow"" you'll read some of the best TNG trek out there.I won't say anything here that will spoil your read, other than in this book, the plot tightens up. The action gets more intense. Here, almost every key TNG character is heavily involved with some facet of the plot. In the end, it all comes together like a nicely tailored suit.It's clear that the authors clearly know the TNG characters as they are written extremely well. Unlike other authors (ahem..Vornholt?) who know very little about the TNG characters.The ""old adversary"" will keep you guessing and will probably hit you (as it did me) like a ton of bricks once you put the peices together.These two books (this and ""A Time to Sow"") are the best books of the ""A Time to....."" series. It's a must read."
3,Good story fragment.,"Not a bad read at all; still, I have to dock it a star since it is not a complete story by itself, having no beginning, and it wasn't exceptional enough to rate five stars to start with. It is simply the conclusion of the story begun in ""A Time To Sow"". I would probably rate the two books together at four stars, but neither one by itself is that good."
1,Managed Care in Dentisry,"This book gives no suggestions for how a dentist can resist HMO's and remain in private practice. The author seems to think that managed care is inevitable and dentists need to get used to the ""advantages"" of managed care. He never even suggests that independant dentists can stay independant if we reduce overhead expenses and just say ""no"" to the HMO's."
4,digital media port w/blue tooth works great,I just got the sony TDM-BT1 through Amazon. It was very easy to configure. It sounds terrific. The range from my sony walkman to the blue tooth rceiver is better than expected. I am glad that Sony finally put out a product to enable walkman users to play music digitally though the sony home theater system.
3,Not For The Clubber Who Knows,"Thanks to the inaccurate review of 'A Music Fan' from California, I bought this CD thinking I would get the ""full length' versions of the songs. Well, if you want the 'full-length-single-edits', this is for you. Only Cheryl Lynn's ""Got To Be Real"" is the 12"", all others are not. Songs that run between 7 and 10+ minutes in their full versions are all between 3 and 5 minutes on this CD. If this doesn't bother you, the selection is great for the budget price."
2,fidelity is very poor,"Just got this CD. The fidelity of the tracks is a very great deal poorer than what you get from the standard compilations. It is stereo (though occasionally you wonder about that), but the sound is tinny and ""small."" I listened to Cheryl Lynn's ""Got To Be Real"" on this CD and then again on another CD I own, ""Platinum R&B; Party"". No comparison the latter blows away the D 'n' D track.This CD is cheap used for a reason. Only get it if there is a song on here you can't find anywhere else conveniently (I bought it for ""Work To Do"" by the Isley Bros. and ""Instant Replay"" by Dan Hartmann, both iconic disco-era tracks not available on too many various artists CDs."
4,great!,well I don't now what to say I just love this book I boughted in my local book store and it is so great. I have a mexican husban and I used to have no idea how to prepare latin food but this book really helped me .I hope you enyoyed to as much as I have . Besaides maria dolores is a great writter and a fabollus chef.It's really worth it.
5,Maravillada,"Quede maravillada con tanta imaginacion de parte de tan grande escritora. La trama te mantiene siempre en suspenso y el final te dejara con la boca super abierta. No te lo puedes perder, de verdad uno de los mejores libros de Agatha! Te lo recomiendo"
5,Froggy Goes to School,Froggy goes to School is about a young frog who goes to school for the first time. This book taught little kids not to be afraid to go to school and that school can be fun. The reading level is about 1st grade but is a good story to read to kids for a story time or bedtime. The book was funny and it was a joy to read and I hope every one has the chance to read this book in the future.
4,Froggy GoesTo School,"The book Froggy Goes To School is a great childrens book. It is about the main character Froggy is having a dream that he showed up one day at school in his underwear. Then his is awoken by his dad. Froggy thought it was an actually day when it wasn't. After his dad wakes him up, he gets dressed and off to his first day of school he went.If kids were to read this book, it would make them realize how much fun school really is. At school Froggy and his friends start to sing a song that goes a little something like this "" Bubble bubble, toot toot. Chiken, Airplane, Soldier. "" Then his teacher walks in and Froggy thinks he is going to get in trouble, but his principal starts to dance and sing right along with the rest of them. This book shows that going to school isn't as bad as kids make it out to be.I would definitely recommend this book to any children who are not really interested in going to school."
4,Froggy Goes to School paperback book,"The ""Froggy"" books are all great. I had to order another one because our preschool children at our child care center wore it out!!! My grandkids love all the Froggy books too, they are all good stories."
5,Froggie gets it DONE!,"My grandson loves Froggie books. He always picks them off my shelf when is at my house. Froggie is the quincentennial kid. Gets things mixed up, makes a mess, has a ball. Kids can identify with his character and they love him, especially my grandson. I have a Froggie library to choose from and this is a favorite."
5,good book,This is a good book to give children. I especially think it makes a great beginning of the year or end of the year treat for teachers to give to their students.
3,Not my most favorite Froggy Book... but ok,This is defintiely not my most favorite Froggy book. It opens with a story that Froggy goes to school in his underwear and then realizes it's a dream. I think the story could have been written much better and less of a cliche.
3,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this book. I love the ""city cop gets injured, retires and moves to a small town"" genre and like the location and the atmosphere the author sets. However; many people found the characters flat. I however actually disliked everybody. Without going into detail, the main character is timid, lacks character and morals. The main character calls himself pathetic and I agree 100%. I found nothing at all redeeming about the man and could not care less what happened to him or the people around him."
4,Pretty good.,"This is the first book by Steve Hamilton that I have read. I enjoy C.J. Box and this one is similar, although I think I like the Joe Pickett a little better. Still enjoyable, though."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing. It started out quite well but I found the development of the back-story predictable and the denouement too drawn out. As others have commented, the characters weren't well developed and I couldn't care what happened to them. This applies also to the main character, about whom we learn little except for the one incident which underpins the book."
4,GOOD START to a great series. Audiobook.,"The Alex McKnight series is a really enjoyable series.You can read other reviews for the plot.This first book and is not the best of the series, but is still good.Alex is no Jack Reacher and finds himself in precarious situations.If you have bothered to read this, please read the rest of the series, you will love him.A cold Day in ParadiseWinter of the Wolf MoonThe Hunting WindNorth of NowhereBlood in the SkyIce RunA Stolen SeasonMisery Bay - my least favorite of the seriesUnfortunately, SH's two stand alone novels are not worth reading, just concentrate on Alex McKnight."
3,Locked Room Mystery in Reverse,"Good setting, good characters. Plot is weak at the end, where Alex figures it all out, seems pretty contrived. He should have started thinking about the possibilities when the issue of ""not a real gun"" came up. And characters who were hostile do remarkable turnarounds without much basis for doing so.Still, though, it was fun to read and I'll read the next one, expecting plotting and characterizations to improve as the series moves on."
4,No wonder it's been honored.,"After The Lock Artist, I decided to go back to the beginning of the Alex McNight series to give it a try. No wonder it was honored at the time. I really liked it enough to say I'll try to catch up with the whole series. Mr. Hamilton will be a new author I plan to follow. And no, I've never been up in the upper peninsular of MI, and don't intend to either."
3,A good read but that's about all.,"I read most of the other three star reviews and have to say that I don't understand how some of them can say that they dislike the book so much but give it an average rating of 3 stars. Seems contradictory to me. I also don't understand the five star ratings that so many people gave. To me five star means it is an enduring classic (ala The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon). This book is definitely NOT a classic. Although I found it a good read for the most part.I liked the setting, most of the characters, and some of the dialog. I also found the relationship between the main character and the police chief Maven to be unrealistic. I also couldn't figure out what Sylivia's problem was. But then again I can't figure out women as a whole, what guy can?But it seems like a good first effort despite the Psycho killer thing that is much overdone by a lot of authors.I expect for this author to improve over time. If he doesn't then I will stop reading him."
5,A great north country debut!,The characters and setting fit like cozy warm mittens gripping an ice pick. And the great thing about Northern Michigan is that there's lots of room for Alex and company to explore. Great book!
2,Shamus and Edgar Award Winner? Very disappointing!,"Too much hype for a disappointing novel! Sappy dialogue, virtually no character development, and a hero who can't decide if he's Dirty Harry or Pee Wee Herman characterize this ""award winner."" The ending is the major let down. After an interesting, but not unforeseeable plot twist, the story just ends -- no resolution, no follow up -- it just leaves you hanging. Steve Hamilton apparently ran out of ideas, reached his word quota, or was saving up for a sequel. You should ""save up"" your money!"
4,Debut in series gets my vote.,"Steve Hamilton's ""Cold Day in Paradise"" won the Edgar as Best First Novel---I can see why. It completely captured me.It is a tightly written, unpredictable, chilling, quick paced plot. He has a fresh approach to the troubled excop turned detective genre and some witty writing.Mr. Hamilton has created an intriguing protagonist aided by some good supporting characters.The noirish plot kept me guessing all the way with plenty of tension. In fact I guessed who was behind the plot early on, only to reject my deduction. Good twists and turns.All in all a solid, involving debut novel. I will be catching up on this four book series in short order."
4,There's Murder in Paradise!,"In this first novel by Steve Hamilton, Alex McKnight is an ex-cop from the mean streets of Detroit. With a bullet imbedded next to his heart, he retreats to the cold of Paradise, Michigan. Now a private investigator for a lawyer, Alex is content until he stumbles across a murder scene, and the sight of blood stirs horrible memories of his partner's death in Detroit. Eerie messages addressed to him sound remarkably like the disturbed psycho who shot him and his partner fourteen years ago. But he's in jail! How can he be in two places at once? Hamilton writes a superb thriller that catches you right from the start. Alex is an intriguing character--not mancho and yet not a wimp either. His fear of the past was so gripping that it really set the tone for this eerie murder mystery. Can't wait to read the next one in the series!"
3,Weak ending,"I kept reading this book expecting a great conspiracy of some sort at the end. I enjoyed the characters especially the P.I. This is a ery well told story.However, I was let down a little at the end. Not because it was not spectacular but because in one page the reader is wondering what is going on and in a paragraph or two our P.I. figures it all out without a hint.Still a good read."
4,"Forget the mystery, this is just one good story.","The characters, the interactions between them, and the location all feel real. It didn't take me long before I felt like I had to sit down and keep reading until I had finished the book, because I kept wanting to find out more about the characters. A 4 stars because stylistically, Hamilton has a way to go, but I'll look forward to his next book."
3,Author improves with practice,"I picked up this book at the library because the cover said it was an Edgar Award winner. I'm not sure how it earned that distinction. The main character, Alex McKnight, has an interesting past -- former baseball player, former cop with a bullet still near his heart. The setting is unique -- Michigan's Upper Penninsula near the Canadian border. But the book just did not do it for me. Convoluted plot, flat dialogue and generally tepid prose. For some reason, though, I've continued with the series and each one is better than the last. Plod your way through this one so you'll be able to follow the story line in succeeding books."
5,A Cold Day in Paradise,"I loved this book from the first page. As a life-long resident of the Upper Peninsula, I appreciate that Steve didn't portray the ""locals"" as idiots.I can't wait to read the rest of the series and hope that he keeps on writing for a long time.I found it to be quite a page turner, just when you think you have it figured out, your wrong."
3,Want to read more!,"Excellent read! Hard to put down. Locale descriptions along with Alex's friends were very good. Alex is not a perfect hero but his heart is in the right place.(right next to his persoanl bullet)! Some of the characters, especially Sylvia, had cloudy backgrounds but maybe Steve will see fit to share more in upcoming books. Will definitely read more of his books."
2,Didn't like it,Tried the book and read about a third of it but it was really quite ordinary and run of the mill. I felt that the author didn't flesh out the characters greatly and it seemed a light read.
2,Terrific insensitivity to mental illness,"I bought this book to try the first Alex McKnight mystery. While the story is mostly quite engaging, I find the treatment of the psychotic characters extraordinarily insensitive. It spoiled the story and the Alex McKnight character for me. Two stars for up until that point."
2,All shrill but Baker,"I have always loved this opera (along with just about all Donizetti), but this highly touted English translation was terrible. Every voice in it was shrill and strident except Baker's. I hated the music hearing it sung in English. It reminded me of Gilbert and Sullivan, and I prefer the Gilbert and Sullivan, even though I don't like Gilbert and Sullivan. (Prudish, priggish Mr. Gilbert, the proto-family values Victorian!) I am listening now to the CD of Maria Stuarda with Sutherland, and once again it's wonderful. Top notes all over the place, even from the men. There was not one single top note sung in this dismal DVD. This was my 2nd try at a DVD of this opera, I won't try again. I wish people who can't sing coloratura would stop billing themselves as though they can! I don't have the money to buy them all to find out."
3,"Nice watch, the band not so nice","The watch is great. The band is really cheap. I know you can't expect the fanciest watch for the price, but they should have a warning label or something."
5,Perfection,You cannot miss with this item. The watch has a very clean appearanceand the leather band sets it off in the best possible light. I would have been happy if the price was twice what I paid.
4,G-Fire II Hits the G- Spot and It's Hot!,"Vernon Neilly and G-Fire brings pizazz to smooth jazz. I enjoy listening to this CD. The compositions are original and the music is fresh. My favorite tracks are LPO, Smoov Soul and Por Mi Amor.Take this CD with you on a lazy Sunday afternoon drive. I anticipate more groovy releases from G-Fire.Christos KioniPositiveVibesRadio.netSmooth Urban Jazz"
4,good filter,"It does what it is supposed to to, filter the air. My last one lasted a long time. Easy to install"
1,UEI UNIVERSAL Remote directtv receiver auxiliary remote rc32,"Very disappointed did not receive this remote thought it glows in the dark in order to see at night or in the dark, its not an uei remote"
1,Inferior Design and Function,"The remote is not ergonomically designed, with the buttons being unlit, very stiff and difficult to use for anyone with a joint disorder such as arthritis. Unless you hold the remote number keys down just the right amount of time, either the number will not register or it will be repeated (e.g., pressing channel 2 may result in channel 22). However, and unlike all other remotes I've used, holding the up and down arrow key buttons does not result in cycling through a menu; instead you must press the up or down buttons repeatedly to arrive at your selection. Unlike other remotes, this one is not at all forgiving if you do not point it directly at the receiver and TV. It is white and dirties easily. Finally, changing channels is not instantaneous, in fact, not even close, taking 4-11 seconds, although this is probably a function of the receiver."
2,Sticky taste,"I was most disappointed with this product. If a taste can be ""sticky"" that is what it tastes like, nothing at all like brandy. To be fair, I have used brandy extract in coffee for many years (so I know it can work out well) and this really makes it undrinkable. I have not baked with it, but I cannot imagine the taste improving by adding heat to it. Very disappointed, recommend against it for anyone seeking a brandy taste."
3,It's OK but it has it's drawbacks,"If you read the reviews, or even go to the Hennapenna site, they will tell you that the colors do not last as well or as long as the ""original"" (that orangey/brown of traditional henna) so keep that in mind so you won't be disappointed.It is certainly easier to use than the lumpy stuff, and easier to get a cleaner line. But there is hardly anything in it, the tube dries up pretty fast and for the price, there isn't enough product in it.The fat tip is a little too fat, and you have to press a bit with the smaller tip. It doesn't flow out very nicely...think...dried up highlighter.It also bleeds out a little into your skin lines. Not sure if regular henna does that or not.For a tiny design, it will probably work find. Don't scrub on it when you wash, just rinse that area. The more you touch up the same design, the deeper the color and the longer it lasts.It has both it's pros and it's cons. I've had fun playing with it, but I won't buy another one."
1,save you money,I bought the henna penna in black. I don't like it. it's that simple. I used the pen on my skin at night and let it dry by morning it was faded or was completely off. I use it multiple times in different area at different times of the day the results were always the same faded with 24 hours. save your money.
5,I adored this documentary,"This was a delightful view of the level of artistry this woman had. Every nuance, every stance is being conveyed to her students and her criticism is often harsh although necessary to preserve her dance standards. I could see the students trying very hard to absorb her style, but just a movement from her eclipsed any of their technical abilities. It is truly inspiring to see great artistry like this and to dream of aspiring to it."
4,A Worthwhile Read,"This gripping story, a fictionalized account of a real wave of terrorism, is more than just a thriller. Author Shakespeare deftly weaves in an intense love story, a political thriller and a treatise on the Indian culture of the Andes. Shakespeare writes with passion, yet passion disciplined by a formidable control of the English language. This is a beautiful book, if that word can be used in a novel that centers around carnage. And, oh yes, if you are a fan of the dance, this book will be right up your alley. I found it a very enjoyable, compelling book."
3,product came bent in the mail,"Very flimsy. Product came bent in the mail. You get what you pay for--cheap product for a cheap price. If you need a strong/durable product, buy something else."
5,Standard Aluminum Mailbox,"We replaced our old rusty mailbox with this new unit. It's well made, mounted easily, and has sufficient capacity for everything."
5,Great purse with long strap,"I was looking high and low for a quality, cool medium size purse with a longer strap. I really DON'T get the carrying the purse by the handle thing, especially with two small children in tow! This is a stylish, well made purse. It is closer to small than medium but comfortably fits my large wallet, small cell phone, and a few incidentals. Lots of pockets, including some on the outside, which I really like. My only (every so slight)concern about the purse is the canvas part of the strap. It allows you to adjust the length of the strap. It appears quite sturdy, but I am afraid that it will fray or become dirty over time (did I mention the two small children)? That hasn't happened....just my paranoia. Anyway, a great buy for the price (1/2 off)!"
5,Amaze-Beans!,"These vanilla beans/pods/whatever-you-want-to-call-them are really amazing. I used about 20 of them to make vanilla extract (but I got so excited that I forgot to slice them open before popping them into the vodka), gave some away, made freaking awesome desserts (vanilla bean cupcakes anyone?), and I still have quite a few leftover to use on a whim!I saw 1 measly vanilla bean in a jar at the grocery store the other day for 9 BIG DOLLARS. I can't even imagine spending $9 on just one bean/pod/whatever. You cannot beat the quality of these moist b/p/w for $25. And you get 54 HUGE B/P/W.AMAZING. BUY THEM."
5,vanilla beans,These beans were moist and plump. These beans were perfect for making vanilla extract! i was not disappointed with my purchase.
5,Wonderfully Delicious Vanilla Beans,I am making homemade vanilla extract with the Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans and they seem to be a wonderful type of vanilla bean for my vanilla extract.
5,Vanilla beans,I used these beans to make my own vanilla liquor. I gave them as Christmas gifts and every one was very pleased with the wonderful fragrance of the vanilla
5,Awesome fragrance!!!,Making homemade vanilla for Christmas!!!!!! Theses beans produce aGorgeous dark syrup. Will purchase again for the wonderful qualityAnd aroma
5,Great value!,These are good quality vanilla beans at a great price. I have been very pleased and would definitely recommend them.
4,Awesome!!!!!!!!,"I was looking for a good deal on vanilla beans and thought I might be taking a gamble when I ordered these, but I was pleasently surprised. The aroma of vanilla could be smelled before I opened the box. The beans were moist, and pliable. I used one to make a large batch of oatmeal yesterday with some cinnamon and sugar and it was delicious. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the resealable bag they were sent in won't do a darn thing to keep air out. So I followed the advice someone else left on another review and wrapped them individually in plastic wrap. I will up date this post in a few months to let you know how they fare over time."
5,Wow...,"I have been so excited to get my beans, ever since I ordered them last week. I didn't even have to open the mailbox to know that they had arrived. I pay 4.00 each to buy them in my town, and they are short, not plump, and not nearly as fragrant as these. I was able to get 54 beans from J.R Mushroom, for around 23.00 and I would have paid around 216.00 in my local specialty store (only place withing 60 miles of me that carries them). Having never ordered any food product online, I was nervous to say the least...but I will deffinantly be able to use vanilla beans more often now, and I will always come back to buy them here!Thanks!!!!"
3,Not so bad for the price.,"For this price it's go along with a smell just so-so, but it's too wet (well, I understand why have to be that way. :)"
3,Vanilla Beans,"The bubble package had been opened when we recived it, so we have no assurance that the beans are safe or if they have been tampered. The aroma is not a ""vanilla"" aroma. We have used vanilla beans several times and have never experienced this unusual aroma."
4,Essential ingredient,"I purchased these beans to make some homemade vanilla extract. I found some vanilla beans at a market near me, but they were sellng 2 beans for $8!!! These were delivered early on a Saturday instead of the Tuesday they were scheduled. The beans were in a nicely vacuume sealed bag, but I was still able to smell the strong vanilla scent. I used a ton of beans for the extract and still have a ton remaining. The beans were moist and plump. I will update after my extract is complete and after using it to make vanilla bean ice cream."
5,GREAT Vanilla beans!!,I bought these mainly to make my own vanilla. I put a liter of vodka and 23 beans in the bottle (as recommended by another reviewer) and it's looking good!! I plan to use the remaining beans in cooking. I hope they're as good as they smell!!
4,Fantastic Price,"I bought these to use in the recipes from Natalia KW's Pure Heaven Cupcake book.The shipping was fast, the quality is superb, and you can't beat the price of .50 per bean....you won't find it any cheaper"
2,I expected more,"I have bought things from this company before and I guess I expected more from their vanilla beans. They have a weird smell, maybe a little burnt? I don't think they are supposed to smell like that. They are plump vanilla beans, but don't have the aroma I expected. Overall, I guess they are just ok. I wouldn't buy them again. And now I have a 1/2 lb. of vanilla beans that I don't really want to use."
1,vanilla beans,I did not care for this product!!! It is a weak bean.The vanilla specks didn't show in the homemade ice cream.The vanilla flavor was very weak even when I put extra beans in the custard.I would not recommend.
4,A good account on Science studies,"Cole's book is a good account of current perspectives about sociological approaches to science - without prophetism nor milenarism. The author himself tries to criticise both constructivist and positivist approaches regarding a deeper analysis of scietific affairs and its making in the scientific mileu. He also rises interesting analyses about the notion of consensus in both the ""research frontier"" and the ""core knowledge"" trying to debunk the comonplace idea that in natural sciences the consensus is higher than in social sciences. I reckon he carries out a serious and interesting critique on some constructivist standpoints... well, just read it."
3,"Not bad, but not superb.","This book is not bad, but not as good as ""The Fiske Guide To Getting Into the Right College"" (my top choice), or ""Making It Into A Top College"" (my second choice).This book is very good and different from other college guides in saying that to buy prestige and not substance by going to selective colleges is like buying status in purchasing cars during the '50s. Nobody bothered to check under the hood. People just assume that brand means everything.The best part of the book is chapter 16 about how to make yourself a college list. It is very realistic. It saves one from aiming too high or too low in college selection.I think the biggest lack in this book is that the author does not recommend a set of colleges that he thinks is better than the selective colleges that he so distasted of. Such a list would have guided the students and parents to better college choices."
4,Something for both long time fans and new readers,"Greg Cox does a great job in writing this first of three trilogy books. One thing I wanted to note was how well he handled each character (both Avengers and X-Men) - showing us their thought processes and providing new readers with enough background on the characters, how they relate to other characters, etc.My only hope is that Greg does not feel the need to do the same recapping (ie. covering the same ground) again in books 2 and 3 (except with new characters coming in naturually). That is one thing that would ruin the series for me."
2,A little flat,I was a bit unimpressed with the wrap up of an otherwise very fun trilogy. With so many heros on the loose it seemed hard for the author to focus on the story. Book three moved too quickly through the various plot lines and gave me some pretty cloudy resolutions.
4,THE BOOK WAS GREAT,"I loved the book. I have read some of his earlier works including the Q CONTNIUM triliogy. the book was great, i suggest you buy it. I did happen to find something wrong with the hulk: Bruce Banner's 3 personalities were supposed to be merged because of Doc. Samson, Hulk was supposed to have the strength of the green hulk, the smarts of Banner, and the cunning of the grey hulk. Even if this book was suppose to have the dumb green hulk she should have been dumber. the hulk was saying i will smash, he dumb hulk awlays said ""hulk will smash."" thank you, i suggest you read the book."
1,this is a HORRIBLE book,"I have only read the first 40 pages of this book and I had to return it. Can they make books any worse? ... When dolls started coming to life I had to question the author's intelligence, when Wolverine got attacked by rapidly regenerating deer I laughed. When a T-shirt attacked Rogue, I had to set the book aside and call it quits on this testament to stupidity. Superheroes may be for the younger audience, but superhero novels are not. I am used to very good plot lines in comics and ESPECIALLY novels. This is the stupidest book I have ever started, well... aside from The Giver, Holes, and Walk Two Moons, and I am sure the other two novels are just as bad if not worse... Please don't buy this book unless you would like to laugh at the publisher for accepting the [stuff] that Greg Cox handed to them. Good Day."
3,Townes review of Rearview,Not a clear sound recording. If you are looking for an album with the rough edges to the songs then this is a good album. If you're looking for good clear studio recordings then this is not your album. Great songs just a little rough for me.
5,Heartfelt...,"Townes Van Zant was a great folk and folk country singer. This album has to be by far his best. Iv'e never heard an album more heartfelt than Rear View Mirror. His vocals, his guitar, and a fiddle, combine to be a great relaxing soothing combination. This album as some upbeat tunes that i guess you could say sounds like bluegrass and/or country. This of course being a live album you can still feel the emotion through him. I cant say anymore except everyone should own this album..except George Bush. I great buy..R.I.P. Townes Van Zant."
5,A classic.,"Wow, I absolutely loved this book. I wish it were a little longer, but it was really great. It really brings out events that could've happened in the past, and it makes you realize what people do to the most beautiful of God's creatures. This book is a real tear-jerker and a cliff-hanger all in one, but it is one of those that you have to love. Maybe if more people read this book, we will realize that animals are a precious gift of life, and we need to enjoy them as much as we can. All in all, I loved this book, and it has earned the title of being under one of the best books I have read."
1,"Same old, same old","Look, I loved the Radiant Seas as much as anyone, but, man, Asaro is running her themes into the dirt with this book. we have:-a character who murkies the line between what is human and what is mechanical...-a dominant female rescuing an endangered, endearing male-and much, much more.some of the characters in this book are dead ringers for players in her Skolian Empire saga, and the relationship between the sexes is as formulaic as ever. Can we see something new here? I'd like to read Catherine Asaro's take on some other social issues..."
3,"Better than I expected, at least","I read every Asaro books, but I had to stop to think before buying this book for it was from Baen(No offence intended) and I recently had a feeling that this talented author was wasting herself(Just see the way her Skolian series' going!)But thankfully, this book was not such a disapppointement. A typical Baen action and typital Asaro romance, but still fun and engaging enough to read in the bed. This book won't be ever noted as her best work, but the author combined all the usual cliches rather neatly, and well, you know, we've seen worse."
3,Good but not as good as her other books,"Sunrise Alley by Catherine Asaro is a book about artificial intelligence and androids that develop self awareness. What defines who is human? The main character, Samantha, is an AI researcher who becomes involved in a cross country chase with a man most people think is an AI.It's not as good as Catherine Asaro's other series, the Saga of the Skolian Empire series. The Skolian Empire books are a romantic space opera with lots of good science and great character development. They weren't published in order (she wrote different books at different times) so I created a list of them in storyline order. The first one is Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire) if you want to get going!"
2,The chase is on,"Turner and Sam are on the run, they're captured, they escape, they're held captive, they escape, they're held captive, they escape, and so it goes. While this constant repetition is going on, Sam waffles constantly over accepting Turner as he is, and becomes more and more Mary-Sueish as the story goes on. Turner, our dead man recreated as a mechanical construct, morphs from being a gentle and likable guy to a creature he insists he's never going to become.This story and the characters showed promise when it started. It's sad that it degraded into a dull run on a hamster wheel."
3,Buyer Beware,"I wish I had read prior reviews before buying this book, because the author's religious tones irritated me to the point of almost throwing it in the trash. That being said, some of the info pertaining to notaries is useful, so long as you can overlook the religious content. If religious tones do not bother you, by all means, buy it. If they offend, however, as they did me, I recommend you find another author who's interest is solely to inform, and not convert."
1,Too Preachy,The author writes at a junior high school level. The book is too preachy (not every Notary is a Bible thumper) and filled with useless info. (such as the part she makes fun of messages/letters/emails she received from stupid people)KISS=Keep It Secular Sweety
1,waste of money,"Puting religious content aside, I would like to share my experience with this book. If you never were a notary, and never did a closing and you are a total idiot, then Victoria's advices on how to schedule an appointment by using yahoo calendar, or how laser fax is better than inkjet- than this book is for you. The author dwells on some minor things and neglects the loan signing procedure. By Victoria the closing should look like- Go to Borrower, pray together, borrower signs with a smile, you notarize, you leave the house. Finally you get paid 125 bucks for 30 minutes. YEAh right. The book is total nonsense, don't buy it. Go to forums and get ideas there. or lie that you are an experienced notary and sign up with signing company. Don't support that religious fanatic!"
4,Good info,"This title isn't a total waste of newsprint, as inferred by the negative reviews already posted. Granted, it could have used a good editor and proofreader, but there is a sizeable amount of useful information contained in the book, certainly enough for me to justify purchasing and recommending it to others. If the religious references scattered throughout the chapters bother you, then simply turn the page; no one is forcing you to read them."
4,A Good Place To Start,I am a Notary Loan Signing Agent of several years. I also run a Loan Signing Service. I found Victoria's book a good way to get basic information when I was new to the business. If you are anti-religious or easily annoyed by such her Christian beliefs will probably put you off. I'm not that easily upset and I thought the book was helpful and she has some good suggestions I hadn't thought of.
5,Wow.,"Beautifully written personal story that speaks to the universal experience of loss. At times, this deeply honest story is quite heartwrenching, yet the depiction of this personal tale --- often peppered with comical insights and characters who become familiar to the reader --- is heartening in its courageous depiction of how deep the wounds of death can cut and how the path to healing is long and filled with personal revelations."
2,Loving in the war years,This book was a mistake for our teacher to assign to us. It was boring and there was a lot of Spanish word in it that I don't know and did not care about. The author was a little bit weak on her organising of some chapters.
3,Better left alone!,"Moraga's LOVING IN THE WAR YEARS is a classic in Chicana literature indeed. However, the new edition just doesn't cut it. The new essays are interesting to read, but they are not as compelling as the original text. Definitely worth buying, but certainly disappointing as far as ""updating"" the book."
4,Best David Decoteau Movie In Years!,"1313: Giant Killer Bees is another guilty pleasure directed by David Decoteau. I've been a long time fan of Decoteau's, even if nearly all of his movies are just an excuse for hot guys to take off their shirts, take showers, etc. Actually, that's why I'm a fan! Giant Killer Bees is his movie in years, maybe since Leeches. The guys in this movie are all hot, including one who unfortunately doesn't even take his shirt off. I'm talking about the hunk who has wavy dark hair and looks like Taylor Lautner, only a few years older. The shower scenes are really hot, and the camera actually zooms in on the guy's pubic area. And we get to see some brief butt shots in the shower as well. The bees in the film are CGI, and look really bad but fun in a cheesy way. There are some humorous moments sprinkled throughout, making this a campy and light sci-fi / horror film. Here's hoping that Decoteau's numerous upcoming projects are just as good (or better) as this one."
1,1313 Series: Nothing as usual.,"All 1313 series are the same: A ""Great"" review about the best movie ever!!! It is obviously biased and made by the film makers. Then I read many bad reviews of actual customers saying that there is no action, no trill, no suspense, no sex, and no love scene, NOTHING except plain boring repetitive scenes in which you see young half-naked borderline teenagers doing nothing. This series does not reflect in any way previous DeCoteau movies and genre. It was a way to make quick money. It is sad that they systematically add a great review to lure people into buying their product. Everyone is disappointed or pissed about these movies feeling they have been ripped off. I needed to react seeing those fake ""Great reviews"". Customers can use reviews too to re-establish the facts!"
1,Urm.......skip it!,"Batman: Other Realms collects two stories originally printed in Batman: Legends Of The Dark Knight. That comic was about telling completely separate Batman stories that could take place anywhere and any when. They didn't need to be bogged down by current continuity. It was just supposed to be able to let creators tell great Batman takes. Unfortunately, these tales weren't great.....or good. The first story by Hampton and Kneece saw a Batman team-up with a Thor like character but it was really lacking in creativity and the art didn't do it any favor. The second story, while better didn't really make you care or want to read more by the creator or involving the characters. Overall, this is something you read when you haven't read every other Batman book yet and that's about it."
4,SWEET HEARTS,"FROM THE BACK COVER:PICTURE PERFECT by Jill Marie LandisA lady photographer is the last thing Sam Tucker needs on his cattle ranch. Emily Richardson wants to capture his life on film--and is stealing his heart as well. But the rancher's determined to keep love out of the picture.IN A HEARTBEAT by Jodi ThomasAn army fort is no place for a Valentine's Day dance--or so thinks stubborn Colt Barnett.

4,HP CD-RW,"Hp products are generaly solid and built to last. Their CD-RWs are no exception. They have a ruggid feel to them, and you can tell they will last for a good, long time. In addition to this, they will play in some cd players that won't accept other CD-RWs. This is a big plus when you want to distribute data, or music because there is a higher chance that the other recipient will be able to access the cd. The only reason that I felt this product was that of four star quality, was because of the price. Compared to other CD-RWs, this is quite expensive. But if you want reliabilty and don't mind the cost, then this is a fine choise."
4,If it only had...,"The Hewlett-Packard C4438A CD-RW discs are the best CD-RW discs I have ever spent my money on. They are very high quality and are made by a good company, HP. They are also wonderful to make your own custom CDs with. I make my own custom CDs with these discs and they sound wonderful on my CD player. Another great thing about these HP-RW CDs is that they can be rewritten on many times. They even come with their own CD Jewel case.The only disadvantage I found with them is that they do not have a high memory capacity like most other discs. If you were just looking for economical discs and feasible alternatives of data storage, I would say that these are fine, but if you want to put large documents or large numbers of documents on the discs, you may want to get a larger capacity disc. I have also found this product superior compared to other brands of CD-RW discs in almost every aspect except for the smaller memory capacity."
3,Not a bad book!,This isn't a bad book to have if you like the Warhammer 40K universe. I gave this book Three stars only because it's artwork was more towards the Space Marines and Imperial Guard. Don't get me wrong I like the Space Marines and The Guard but I think I would have enjoyed a bit more work about the other species.Plus some of the artwork I have seen often in my local GAMESWORKSHOP and other hobby shops and also the book maybe a few years old but still it's a good buy! I have just started collecting Warhammer 40K books and novels and this book is a nice start! I hope more books like this pop up soon! I'd love to see art books of every chapter and race in the Warhammer 40K universe!!!
4,Not much original art.,"This book has a lot of fantastic art that has been published in other sources by Games Workshop. It is nice to have all a majority of the highlights in one place. The only major let down of this book is that very few if any art work were made specificaly for this pulbication. There is very little information on how the art was created by any specific artist.This book includes a LOT of pictures of space marines. It has minor sections devoted to just about every other aspect of Warhammer 40,000 as well.Overall this book should be in every Warhammer 40,000 fan's library. I only wish it were bigger and had more to it."
5,Great kit! Must have for married couples.,"Love this kit! I just started session 1 and it already has help my marriage for the better! Thank God this material is very helpful in understanding my wife and she understanding me better. I highly recommended! many things you might know other things you might think it will not apply to me but you will find new ideas that will definetely help you. I never like writting and I am finding my self spending valuable time with my wife doing the exercises, having fun and understanding each other more. I believe is worth the investment. I found it here in amazon cheaper than in other places. GOD bless every marriage!"
1,Authors are self serving and primarily out to make a profit,"I ordered the kit directly from Real Relationships. It has some interesting points (for example, the chapter on the differences between how men and women engage with the world and each other) but overall it was too simplistic and put issues too much in black and white. Relationships are complex entities with many factors playing into them that this book doesn't address. Another issue that I had with this set is that the DVD was damaged and skipped at lesson 5. I contacted the company and was sent several replacement DVD's, and they ALL were damaged in the same place. They ended up just not answering my emails and never resolved the issue. For a truly outstanding, beautiful written book that addresses core issues rather than just putting band-aids on disagreements, read Passionate Marriage by David Schnarch."
2,VERY VERY fragile!!,"This toy is best used only as a display that will sit on a shelf and never be touched again. Straight out of the box the tongue on the back of the truck where the trailer connects broke when trying to attach the trailer. EVERY piece that protrudes from the body is extremely fragile and probably won't survive the day. Exhaust stacks, mud flaps, mirrors, etc are flimsy. We also got an F350 and horse trailer from the same company that are equally terrible. The horse trailer doors came off the FIRST time they were opened, and it happens every time they're put back on!!! We finally quit trying and just left them off....Not terribly expensive, but for $20 its absolute junk."
5,FABULOUS,"I bought this Book for my Partner and I wasnt sure of Buying Books Online and I have to tell you the SHipping WAS FAST!!! and What a great book, there were a few mistakes in where the quotes came from but, if you LOVE buffy as my partner & I do then this is GREAT!!!! A MUST HAVE FOR BUFFY FANS!"
3,Nice Compilation But Not For Fanatics,"Quotable Slayer is a compilation of quotes and memorable dialogue from Buffy Season 1 to Season 7. Its organized into sections such as Buffy On... and Quotable Slayer (about Slayers. Its very well organized and small enough to carry around in your bag where ever you go. The choice of quotes is good. There are a few minor errors. It includes full color photos.A highlight is the Quotable Intro which is a nice intro to the book. I would recommend this for fans who'd like to remember things about the show, but for die hard fanatics, this book is not a necessity. You'd probably be able to rant of quotes off your mind right now without the book.Overall, the book is nice but not something that stands out or a necessity for fans at all."
3,,"The content of this book could fit in a single web page, and since essentially none of it is original material, I figure it should be evaluated based on which quotes were selected and how they are presented. The presentation is a high level grouping of quotes into topics, and within each topic there is the most obvious/straightforward listing of quotes-- what was said and who said it. I personally do not find the selection of quotes to be particularly representative of what I felt while watching the show were the most salient or memorable moments or dialog; however, I do think it is far better than just randomly pulling quotes out of the scripts, and so is worth consideration. Of course the book has value as statement of appreciation of the show; I have no idea the degree to which this book serves that purpose better than alternatives..."
3,"Remember that time...? No, me neither.","This is an interesting concept, and it's not bad for the price. I just wish they'd done a better job editing the book before rushing it out. There's a few quotes that are attributed to the wrong episode. That's not so dire, though. They did that in the Watcher's Guides, too. No big deal.What bothers me is that there are quotes in the book that never made it on air. It seems their only source material was the shooting scripts, instead of actually watching the episodes. I really wasn't ready to see Tara's ""Sweetie, I'm a fag."" from the 'Dead Things' script be released commercially yet."
4,"Not A Classic, But A Dope CD","This CD is not as good as ""Soul Survivor"", but it's as firm of a hip-hop release you'll probably find in 2004. There are some tracks I wish he would have saved from ""Petestrumentals"" to let a few other MCs (including himself) rock over, but I guess it's O.K. There's a few joints I wasn't feeling (namely Posterboy), but the gems completely make up for it. My personal favorite is Little Brother's ""Give It 2 Ya"", but ""It's A Love Thing"" comes in a close second. Do yourself a favor and peep out Soul Brother #1."
4,The Soul Brother is back,"Of course this album isn't as good as his first one, I don't think anyone was exspecting it to be as good. It's a step below Soul Survivor, which means it is still good. What I like about it the most is that it doesn't have alot of guest apperances that were also on the first one. He did new stuff with a bunch of different artists. Great varitity. I think this album has some real hot beats, but the songs last too long. My favorite tracks are ""Just Do It"" w/ Pharoahe Monch, ""Beef"" w/ Krumbsnatcha, and ""Appreciate"" w/ C.L. Smooth."
4,Dope.,"Great album with jazzy beats. I agree with some people that Postaboy shouldn't have appeared on this album. Dead Prez ""Warzone"" is sort of a party sound track but just listen to what they're saying and it was weird with ""in the club"" at the end of every bar. RZA and GZA ""Head Rush"" is a short but awesome track and nice beat. Pharoahe Monch, Kardinal Offishall and Black Ice did pretty well. Skillz and Talib Kweli both fit so well with Pete Rock, those were the standout tracks. Also Slum Village did great. J-Dilla and Pete Rock rapping okay on a nice beat. ""It's A Love Thing"" and ""Appreciate"" were great songs with CL Smooth reunited with Pete Rock. Little Brother and Leela James did well too. All in all, this is a pretty good album and Pete Rock did a good job on the beats fitting in well with the rappers. Really loving the beats, one of the best of 2004. Check out Madlib, another great jazz producer. Also check out 9th Wonder of Little Brother, he's great too."
4,Tight But not Soul Survivor I,"This album had to grow on me. I did not like from the jump. But it tight though. There are some songs that could have been vaulted, but at least its not Lil Flip, an album full of fillers.Top 3 Songs: One Mic One DJ, We Good, Give it To yaBottom 3 Songs: It's tha Postaboy, Villa, Just Do ItSleeper: Beef (Hot beat), No Tears"
5,thirteen years of hip hop soul classics,"first off let me just say that pete rock has been here doing hip hop for about 13 years,the first cd I ever brought was the first soul survivor.Since then I have picked up everthing with his name on it,this man is one of if not the best hip/soul producer of my time and this cd is no joke it took me about week just to get of the first song and boys and girls that first song is like class for hip hop. I have been a fan since the begining of hip hop and in all of those years I have never herd an introduction so powerful the bassline is sick the horns is a classic touch .Iam felling all songs except one and the one is not dead prez, those guys is real we need to wake up on real hip and stop fallin for the crunk crap,hip hop like this is the reason hip hop has last.Thank you pete rock for not steppin out yourself just to fit these days of wack track"
5,The beautiful voice of Judy Collins,"This CD is excellent. In addition to containing ""Bread and Roses"" which is a tribute to the women's movement and to struggling women everywhere, Judy's voice is so beautiful and magnificent I would recommend this CD to every lover of Judy Collins and lovers of social justice to everyone"
4,travel info,This book has a lot of travel info. It also has some history in it. It's great for the people that would like to travel around NY state.
4,Great for Oliver collectors,"This book is a must if you are trying to restore an old Oliver tractor. There are a lot of color pictures, some are original color. There is also a complete history from Hart-Parr to AGCO/White including a lot of original advertisements. I have been very satisfied with this book"
1,This tee stinks,"This tee stinks. After a dozen mis-hits, the top split. I asked Franklin for a replacement, which they quickly sent.The bigger problem is this tee STINKS. Do not keep this in your car unless you want your car to smell like smokey rubber and ash. My sweat shirt that was in the trunk with it has been washed twice and still stinks of it. Other clothes that were in the laundry with it now have the smell. I thought the smell would go away but two months later the tee's odor is still as strong as ever.I asked Franklin about this, and they said it's just the nature of the rubber they use..."
1,Broke right away,"My son used this for batting practice. The top tube split the first time he was using it. The second time he went to practice off if it, the very top part of the tube ripped completely off."
2,Batting Tee,"This batting Tee has little nipples to ""help"" hold the ball. After the first practice trying to teach 8 year olds how to hit, half of them had been knocked off. The other half that stayed on were no longer ""helping"" hold the ball off but yet now in the way. Now the Tee just has and oversize platform to hold the ball on. The product still works, I just wish I would have went with a different type."
1,dangerous - batteries heat up fast,"This is not a safe product for younger children (the box states for ages 7-up). I had to do all the work, so my son got bored quickly.Important safety note: the 2 AA batteries I placed in the battery holder unit heated up in minutes, without being linked to anything else in the kit. The batteries got so hot that I could not touch them with my bare hands!The book is great--fun and instructional, but the items in the kit are dangerous. I returned our kit for a refund.I bought Elenco's Snap Circuits 100 kit for my son for Christmas also, and it is a totally safe electronics kit that my son can use all my himself or with supervision. Buy Snap Circuits NOT this poorly made kit."
4,Nice procuct,Haven't had to use one yet to replace the one in the toy - but my =^..^='s love the toy and when they slow down playing with it I will replace the catnip packet.
2,Not that great,Bought these to put in some of our cat's toys and they weren't effective at all. They were great by themselves (our cat's grabbed them before I could get them out of the package) but inside a toy somehow diffused the odor because they ignored the toys. I ended up opening the little sacks and pouring the catnip out into a container to give them loosely because I didn't want them chewing the sacking. I won't buy these again - not worth it.
3,My cat is not responsive to it.,Your service /delivery was fine. My cat just didn't get into it. I gave it to a friend and she has not commented about it.
1,Dissapointed,"The slits are too wide which results in the - yolk sliding through it; or the egg white pulling the yolk along with it; or the yolk breaking (the 3 times I did use this separator one of these happened) . The separator is very sturdy, shinny but does not do its job so would not recommend it."
1,Dalla Doesn't Do!,I don't recommend the Dalla Piazza Egg Separator. It's awkward to hold and crack the egg inside. It's takes the egg white too long to run out of the side openings. And the side openings will break the yolk. I would not have purchased it. I'm now looking for a replacement.
5,Like the globe,We travel a lot and like to relate places. The globe was easy to assemble and looks nice in our living room.
2,Too Little that's Good,"While the CD features a few gems like Moonlight Gambler and Rawhide, most of the others are second rate. If you want a CD full of great songs of the west, try Marty Robbins or the Sons of the Pioneers."
2,blac&decker powered handsaw,not a fan of this product at all i can cut faster with a hand saw !!! buy a sawsall more blade tooth choices
3,"Blade installation could be better, B&D!!","It took so long to figure out how to install the blade, 2 hours on Sat + 1 hr on Sun! I haven't had a chance to use it, yet! I hope it's worth the trouble, and thank goodness for Amazon's reviews that told me how to adjust the screw! I will wait until Monday to try it and hope it will work like others said."
2,Used once,Not reliable. I used it once to prune small branches from trees and it did okay. I packed it away and two months later the blade would not click back in to the saw. It's useless.
1,Black and Decker saw,"I had to return the product, as the blade did not fit into the saw. The receiving end of the saw was flawed and did not open all the way."
4,Lovely little saw...,"So far have used it to cut metal, plastic and wood. It takes some muscle as you still have to ""saw"" it back and forth as well as add pressure like you would a chain saw. Having difficulty installing blades, as well. Otherwise it's been a pretty handy little saw!"
2,This Was Not for Me,"This is a great idea, and I wanted to love it, but it didn't work for me. I tried to cut through a two inch branch. It took so long I gave up. I was able to cut faster with my hand saw. I tried two more times with the same result. Even if it did work, I wouldn't have been able to put up with the vibration.I had trouble attaching the blade, so I laid the saw down on a table and shone a flashlight in the opening so I could see what I was doing. I had no trouble attaching the blade after that."
2,Returned to manufacturer,"The saw does work great, however after inserting the blade into the mechanism effortlessly a couple of times and using it, something must have broke and the blade would no longer lock into place. Returned to Black and Decker and received a brand new one, the locking mechanism on this one might not work either I think. Very very poor design, not worth the bother even though the saw cuts great."
2,Black and Decker Power Handsaw slow cutting.,"I purchased the Black and Decker power hand saw to cut up dead limbs and do some light prunning. The saw is very slow and cutting limbs with it was a big disappoint..The saw blade needs to be a more aggressive tooth design and more travel on the blade to saw faster.Even on small limbs very slow,not worth the money."
5,Fabulous saw,"I'm back to order a second one. The first one lasted for 5 years and cut down 4 trees with trunk diameters of 3,4,6 and 9 inches. It cut up 6inch x 6inch x8 foot landscaping timbers along with numerous other small branches, tree trimming and misc jobs.Attaching the blade is not difficult.I believe the first broke due to me forcing it too much and the locking mechanism for the blade broke.Its my go to tool to cut up anything. It works better than a husband and it doesn't talk back."
2,"A handy one, but not reliable, broken down in a short time.","I used this saw several times to cut tree branches. It worked well. The installation of the blade is not as difficult as some comments said. It took me a couple of minutes to put it on and worked fine.After light use for 6 months, the saw is broken down totally. The saw blade falls down, and cannot be fixed."
1,Frustrated beyond belief!,"I waited for this saw with great anticipation. BUT alas, like many others I simply could not get the blade to insert! I can see the problem BUT how to fix it? They say just take a flat blade screwdriver and turn the locking pin till it is parallel to the bottom of the saw. OK BUT try to do that!!! The darn thing won't budge and even though I tried several differnt sizes of screwdrivers, I could not get the pin to turn.After reading ALL reviews I'm assuming that if you are lucky enough to get one that has the lock pin in the right direction...it's a great saw. However, when you can't even load a blade it is worthless.I wonder if they might consider CHECKING each saw BEFORE sending it out to make sure the pin is parallel."
1,Junk,"My wife & I, with 3 masters degrees between us, spent over an hour trying to insert the blade into the saw. I don't know what type of advanced technical expertise you need to master the techique needed but clearly we do not have it as we never succeeded. Have no idea how well the saw works as we never got it to work. I wanted a simple inexpensive easy to use electric pruning saw - this isn't one. Product should come with a warning label."
2,Purchaser's comment,Although the website does not say as much this item CANNOT BE USED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. I was given a full refund and told to scrap the tool WHAT A SHOCKING WASTE.
4,very useful,I had a earlier model of this saw and loved the versitility. I'm sure this will be as good as the one I wore out.
3,Easy to use,"This is my second one. The first broke and wasn't fixable, but it broke after a lot of use. I'm a small woman, and I like to prune trees. This is the only saw I can manage. I recommend it for any smaller branches within reach of an extension cord. I trim crape myrtles, dogwoods, that sort of smaller tree. It will saw through tough roots, but that is how it finally broke. I rated it three stars because inner parts are plastic, and you can't open it to repair it."
4,A Well Received Gift,"i purchased this and extra blades for a friend. It has been well used in the past 3 weeks! i have had no complaints but lots of comments about how efficient and easy it is to use.It was purchased at Amazon, and as with every other item i've bought from them, the delivery was super quick. i have never had any issues when buying from Amazon!"
5,Just what I expected,"Owned an earlier version of this saw and when it broke I had to get another one. Very handy for small jobs, even used it to cut a palm tree down. Don't use if often but when I do it does the job."
5,It's a Power Horse!!!,"This little handsaw is truly a power horse. Of course I am not surprised...it's a Black and Decker. I had a large flowering bush that I needed to cut down and in less than a hour it was down and the pieces cut up so that I could dispose of them...Oh, yeah, did I mention that I am a woman and I loved this just as much as everyone else. I also live in a small rural town where it is very hard to find people willing to do these projects...so you have to find a way to do them yourself. Looking for more things to cut down."
1,saw,"Great idea but very Poor design. Out of the box, mine was defective inthat, just loading the blade wasn't possible?"
5,Indespensible tool,"I am a contractor. My wife bought this Navigator saw for use around the house. I laughed at it and called it a ""girl saw"". One day a few years ago we had a knotty problem cutting a large beam. I reluctantly tried the Navigator. It worked perfectly. Now we have four of them on the job sites and the guys fight over them. Cutting pipe, notching framing members, accurately slicing large beams, I just wish they had made it a bit more durable."
3,Easier than a hand saw!,"Black and Decker PHS550B 3.4 Amp Powered Handsaw with Storage BagLove how much easier this saw is than a hand saw. I am a senior citizen, and I use this saw to cut up larger branches when I trim my trees into smaller bundles.My only complaint is that I had a very hard time putting the saw blade into the slot. I didn't think the instruction on how to do that was clear at all. That is the only reason I didn't give it a higher rating. A strong man probably wouldn't like it, but it sure was what I needed. A regular hand saw would not have worked for me."
5,Powered handsaw,We are very pleased with this powered handsaw. It is perfect for pruning small trees and shrubs after the branches get a little too large for loppers. We used it to thin out branches on a Bradford pear which will help prevent it from splitting during strong winds. It was not necessary to get out the chain saw which is much heavier and harder to start plus it requires checking gas and oil then priming. We have already recommended it to some other people.
3,keep buying it,"I am 74 year old woman...This is my forth saw i have bought and use it a lot in the yard but i find the gadgetthat holds the saw stops working..saw comes out and will not go back on..yet I love it and keep buying them,maybe it's me that don't know how to work it right and I am lost when mine stops working thanks"
5,Great Saw,"I am telling all of my friends that this is a must have saw. I am building a wooden boat and I am finding so many places to use this saw. It makes very clean and fast cuts in plywood and it is very easy to make cuts by eye with out pre-marking. It even makes fast cuts in 2"" lumber."
5,This little saw is great!,"You need to use a sawing motion to slice through what you are sawing, but the powerful motor makes your task easy! I cut left over material from our house remodel into firewood in a short time."
3,"Too Many Plastic Parts, but works for a While.","I used this a lot!!I have used this saw repeatedly, probably more use than others. I use it to trim trees, cut wood upto 4x4, on my large property. My only complaint is that as the blade cuts and you push on the top of the saw, the back of the blade starts to rub on the plastic top guide. The guided should have been metal or a stronger saw mount base. THis makes the saw unsafe after 25-40 uses on wood over about 2"" thick. The blade tips back and gets worse.Like I said I use it more than most and for the price and what I used it for it did the job on metal and wood, but it is not a long lasting tool and for hard work like I used it for, it made it worth while.However in the future, I would buy a regular name brand reciprocating saw to get some more value in my tool box, but for the average user you should get more than enough uses, but not a tool to pass on."
4,great saw,"This is great for trimming smaller branches, up to 3 in diameter. Use this like a saw, back and forth. I'm 60, female and I luv it. purchased in March 2010"
4,great little saw,"I bought this for my son as a gift since I have one of my own....its much safer and easier to use than a chain saw and works great....tree limbs, lumber, light building projects etc....."
4,good saw,"good saw - the blade seems to be wearing quickly though, after only a few uses. i would recommend it for smaller jobs."
2,Needs much better instructions,"I would suggest that only those that are really good with tools and gadgets order this product. The instructions are extremely limited with all these little ""figure this and figure that"" pictures. It was just annoying, and I could never get the blade in its place to even see how this product worked. The only reason I won't just flat out suggest that it's a bad purchase is because perhaps others are more mechanically inclined than I."
4,Worth it.,"Works fine as a handsaw, but hard to keep straight when used as a jigsaw. Manageable size and weight for most jobs. Blade loading and changing a challenge at first but not when you learn to look through the little hole on one side and line up the blade hole with the internal peg to which the blade attaches."
1,worthless,"can not get blade installed this saw is worthless and I would not recomend it, have been unable to use it and going to send it back."
2,dissatisfaction,I was disappointed with this item. It is just like a copy edition so that I can't help returning it.
4,A little top heavy,My daughter loves this - kids love to push things in general - but it is a little top heavy and Im not convinced it's the safest choice when it comes to a shopping cart.
1,Don't Buy This,"My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday. She wants to play with it, but the front axle and both wheels will not stay on the front of the cart. I am returning it to the store today to get something else."
2,Both children got stuck,"Both my three year old daughter and 15 month old son have now gone through a stage where they like to flip the shopping cart on its side and climb into the area between the cart and wheels, getting stuck. One of the times my son was stuck, the cart tipped over with him in it, hitting his head on the wall and we thought he had injured the leg that was stuck. My kids have so much fun pushing the cart around and pretending to shop... It's a shame we'll have to pack this one up for their safety."
2,VERY POOR QUALITY!!!,"We recently purchased one of these for our son after having borrowed and older style little tikes shopping cart from a friend. Someone was clearly trying to save a lot of money while designing this new model. The wheels DO NOT stay on, I am forever putting them back on. Also it is not nearly as sturdy as the older model. When my son pulls himself up on it, it tips over and he falls. If you are considering a little tikes shopping cart do not buy this model, look for one of the older models at a garage sale or on ebay. Thats what I did after I returned this one!!!!"
4,Love it,"I bought it for my niece, she love it, play with it instantly. I did not buy the accesories because she use any single toy she had and put on it."
4,Very fun!,"It was a little hard to put the wheels on and it does require some pounding, so don't plan on assembling it while at nap-time as a surprise like we did. It's super fun though. My LO loves putting thing in it, especially her dolls and once the cat, she'll knock it over and climb all over it or use for an extra leg up to reach something high. It's a sturdy little piece of equipment and I've seen 8 year olds that clamor to use it. My neighbor still has one that she bought her 6 year old when she turned one. They last both time and changing interests."
2,14 month old hurt playing with this shopping cart,"My 14 month old was excited when I finally got this put together, (more difficult than expected, theres a screw in the basket that just hangs down and can be pulled out be child) MY DAUGHTER GOT STUCK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CART, HEAD AND ARMS THROUGH THE SPACE. I think the open area is dangerous for small children for that reason. It doesn't feel quite as durable as the older model. We plan to return it and buy the old model."
1,Shopping Cart tips over way too easy,"I bought this item for my grandchild who is 2 and she has mostly enjoyed pushing it around. I have been disappointed with the fact that it tips over so easy. The front part of the basket sticks out way beyond the wheels on the bottom and when she leans over to get something out of the basket, it tips and she falls. I hope that little Tikes will make the changes necessary to make the shopping cart safer."
1,"Poor Engineering, Wheel covers will not stay on","Do they not assembly these at the factory and test the tolerances for themselves? I assembled per the instructions and when my two year old gave it a test drive, the blue wheel covers fell off. If the good folks at Little Tikes want to save a little money on manufacturing and not create some sort of tab fasteners and use a friction fit instead, at least get the tolerances right. This was the one part that required just a little engineering and they just blew it. I can't tell you how disappointed the wife and I are at the low quality from such an established brand."
5,Okay...we don't own one (yet!),"While staying at the Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House awaiting the birth of our first child, my husband and I have watched EVERY child who comes through the house play with this toy...it has become kind of a joke between us because no matter what their age or gender, this is by far the most popular toy in the house. We are planning on buying one when we get back home because the shopping cart's popularity has been astounding! Just thought we'd pass it along..."
5,Best shopper,"I have bought other little shopping carts, but none last very long. I have three girls and I watch other children this little cart gets a lot of use. It was a little bit hard to put together by myself, but not too bad. Just a couple of pinched fingers."
4,Sturdy and lots of fun,I got this for my son's 3rd birthday and he loves it. It's very sturdy and he wheels it around the house cleaning up his toys and cars. I only wish I would have bought it a year ago!
3,Not very happy,I bought this product as a gift for my niece. First of all the cart in the picture and the cart you receive are different colors. The most important problem is the wheels dont stay on. Everytime she goes to push the cart the wheel covers keep comong off.
2,This shopping cart is a pain to put together,I've already spent way too much time trying to screw the basket in and hammer the wheel caps on. What a pain in the neck. This was the most expensive cart and I can't believe it's taking this long to put together - not worth it!
2,Wheels fell off,"My dad bought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday, we haven't had much trouble with it flipping like in other reviews but after a couple months of play our problem became the front wheels came off. The way the cart is designed to be put together it does not stay together when the wheels are ""pounded"" back onto the steel bar. This was bought at Meijers and we do not have the reciept so we are out of luck with there new no return or exchange policy without a reciept."
5,Hours of Pretend and Active Play Fun,"Updated March 2010After five years, we just got rid of this to make more room for more toys! The cart is so durable, and my kids keep things neat and clean, that we were able to sell it to another family.Both my kids loved this toy. They played with it while they were younger (until about 3 yo), then they wold just take it out from time to time. Mostly, we used it for storing toys.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My nearly two year old daughter totally loves this toy. She uses it for transporting all her small dolls around the house, but also likes to ""drag race"" with it. It's very sturdy too -- I have a feeling, this one is going to be in our house for a very long time."
4,Good toy for kids,"My daughter likes this, she pushes it around the house pretending that she's food shopping. It's not the easiset to put together..."
4,Very bulky but it does it's job!,"This is pretty large and very bulky so if space is an issue, I wouldn't recommend it. My kids like to play with it, though there isn't much space to put ""babies"" in it. My one year old likes to tip the cart over and ""ride it"" like a horse... well she likes to get stuck so it is a pain for me to have to deal with that every few minutes. BUT, when they are playing with it right the kids love it. I just wish it wasnt so bulky."
4,Durable and Cute-for kids older than 2,"My kids are 18 months and they love this, unfortunately they are too young for it because they keep tipping it over and they try to ride in the basket. My son tipped it over while he was in the basket and bumped his head. I may have to hide it till they are older. The manufacturer probably recommended age 3."
3,"Shopping, tool bucket, stuffed animal transport and beyond","There really isn't an activity or toy that this cart hasn't been worked in to. We tried to find one used, but this toy seems to be the plastic, modern version of the velveteen rabbit - all of the ones we found at garage sales, etc. were well worn by play and ""love""."
5,One Happy Little Girl!,"Twenty some years ago I purchased Little Tikes Shopping Cart, which my daughter loved. No need for a doll buggy. When I purchased the new, improved model for her daughter, I wasn't sure it would be as sturdy. It is. My 13 month old granddaughter pushes it, as well as pulls it, all around with her stuffed animal friends in it. I'm glad I purchased it as it is of good, sturdy quality and attractive design."
4,shopping cart,"I know that once it is together it will be a great toy. HOWEVER, if it EVER gets together. The directions are terrible and no screw holes. I admit I am not the best builder I tend to be able to build by looking at the item as I find most directions so incredibly hard to follow. These are just hard with no holes for the screws and trying to figure out where they go. Have to wait on giving this toy to my boy when he wakes as it is impossible for me to figure out how to finish it."
5,Shopping Trolley,"Bright colours, stable, easy to assemble, easy to push, and enough space for lots of shopping.My two year old , just, grandaughter, loved this and I would recommend it without hesitation.In addition because it is plastic, it seems ok to bump into walls and furniture without doing any damage to the cart or the household items.Good value and good fun!"
1,DANGEROUS!!!!! Buyer beware!,"My son and daughter absolutely loved this toy, however we were quick to get rid of it when my 2 1/2 year old knocked his front teeth loose after he had climbed into the basket. It could be made much safer. If a child climbs in, it pretty much throws them into the floor. While not the function of the cart, how many kids will resist trying to climb in. It's definately not worth the risk. There are safer ones out there."
2,What fun is it without the food??,"My hubby and I purchased this item for our daughter's 2nd birthday this weekend. As I was about to wrap it today, I realized that it does not come with any of the food or accessories that are pictured on the box! What a rip off! This fact should have been made more clear on the box. I am taking it back ASAP for a less expensive version that does come with plastic food. What fun is it without the food!??!?"
3,OK,"This shopping cart was easy to put together and my daughter loves it. I only have on problem with it. The wheels kept popping off. I had to super glue them to the white part they snap into. Other than that, I think it's great."
3,Great toy for over 2-yr-old,"My 2-yr-old daughter has this grocery cart and loves it. We bought it for her when she was about 15 months old, thinking it would be fun for her. It was fun then, but for the wrong reasons. She kept wanting to climb inside it, so we put it away for several months. We brought it out again at about 20 months, and it has been great. She is now 26 months old, and she loves loading it with groceries and sitting her ""babies"" in it while she shops. She counts items as she puts them in and counts them as she takes them out, and sometimes she'll ""ring them up"" at her little cash register! I do recommend this toy, but your child needs to be close to two years of age to get full enjoyment from it. I have a friend whose child climbed into his recently and ended up at the emergency room after it turned over. We do like it a lot, now that our daughter knows it's for shopping...not for climbing!"
1,Tips Over -- Very disappointed!,I read all the reviews on this cart and other carts for over an hour before making a purchase and my main reason was because this cart was NOT supposed to tip over and it tips over CONSTANTLY! It tips forward and my daughter will fall over on top of it. I'm just really disappointed. It seems to be a really durable product but it is NOT balanced correctly. I wish I had not made this purchase now.
5,"different color than photo, assebly required, sturdy, daughter loves it!!","Daughter loves this shopping cart. There is room to fit a doll in the front and plenty of ""groceries"" in the cart. I was suprised that the cart was actually different colors than the photo, ours has a blue cart, white handle, and green wheels. Assembly is required and was challenging trying to put together with an excited toddler present."
5,A Must Read by Parents Everywhere,"Betsy Hart stands up for a parents right to raise their children in this masterfully written book. She embraces her role as a parent and aims to empower parents all over to leave the ""experts"" behind and trust in your ability to be an excellent parent. Throughout her book she emphasizes the appropriate mix of seeking advice and making your parental decisions based on what YOU know is best for YOUR family. Packed with information this book is a must read."
5,If there had to be only one...,"I've always been interrested by the computer world and one day decided to teach myself programming. I picked up this book and started to read. At that moment, I didn't even know what a programming language was. I read it from cover to cover and didn't have the impression to learn something but suddenly I found myself programming small applications. I read other books then and today I'm a MCSD (Microsoft Certified Solution Developer). During my whole journey on the learning of programming, this one was the clearest book I've read. So, if you're a complete beginner in programming, get this book fast ! I would even recommend you to read it BEFORE moving to .NET books. If you already are a programmer coming from another language, it may not be the right choice."
2,Only for the very beginning programmers,"When I came to university, we used the 5.0 version of this book for learning VB. I found it way too simple since I already had programming knowledge and would better have seen a book which went more deeply on the topics and covered more of object oriented programming. This book is for a part just click-and-play which might be very useful only for people who starts with programming from scratch."
5,Lots of small programs to demonstrate how to write VB6.,"I am an engineer, not a academician. David Schneider's book provided such a large number of examples, that I could find something similar to what I needed on the CD-ROM, which I could in turn copy, modify, and run.I personally *learn* better from many small examples than one large example."
3,How far does this take you in terms of certicication?,"I have been using this book as a textbook for a university programming course. I find it quite good, though I wouldn't rave about it. Mostly I seem to be progressing quite well using this book, though there are a few confusing parts. I certainly can't complain about the number or quality of the exercises and projects. Do all of these and surely you are no longer a ""Dummy""!I now have a question for the more experienced programmers - if I want to be Microsoft certified, how much more do I need to know on top of this book? What are your recommendations? I'm not sure if my email address will appear elsewhere, so if you have an answer to this question, please email me at egan@powerup.com.au. Thanks."
2,College text used - not happy,I have my VB final due tommorrow. I have to agree with another reviewer. The examples don't explain what you need to know for the projects. My teacher is very smart but she grades hard. Between that and this difficult to learn from book our class has gone from 22 students to get this 4. There are 4 of us left in what should have been a beginner type programming class.I am going to buy a Thompson Learning VB book instead. I am sure it will be better.The only guy who did well with this book already had C++ I and II.
1,It is the worst,"This is the worst book I've had to deal with. I bought this book because it was required for a programming class. I find the book to be unhelpful, confusing, disorganized with unclear examples. If you are interested in learning Visual Basic, look elsewhere. This is definitely one book that you should avoid."
2,Not the Best At all,"I bought this book as it is a reading text for my univerisity course. However, I have found this book extremley difficult at times and have often had to refer to other sources to get the required information. The text is very technical and is not user friendly. For beginners, I would NOT reccomend this book."
5,the best show ever,Sonny with a chance is the best show ever. I think almost every kid would love it. It is super funny. If you like demi lovato you shold get camp rock. I know i love demi.
4,Sonny's Big Break,"It took awhile for Sonny With a Chance to grow on me. The humor was silly, but I did enjoy the characters.The episode on this disc are:""Sketchy Beginnings"",""West Coast Story"",""Sonny At The Falls"",""Cheater Girls"",Bonus Episode - ""Sonny In The Middle""I wish Disney would release the complete series or more volumes, but they probably never will. At least we have these five episodes on DVD."
1,Warning! ONLY 4 episodes!,"Sneaky Disney marketing strikes again!! While my daughter enjoys the show, we were very disappointed to purchase this and find that it only contained 4 episodes...far from a whole season, not even a half season!To be fair, the amazon reviews here do make that clear. Unfortunately, we bought the DVD set in a retail store. And looking just at the package it was FAR from clear that ""Volume 1"" was not only NOT a ""Season 1"" compilation, but that it was a measly 4 episodes! We could have bought any 4 individual episodes on iTunes for less (and forget about the measly ""extras""!)So, 4 stars for the show (my daughter would say, although I wouldn't rate it quite as high as an adult), but 0 stars for the DVD packaging."
5,Awesome,The Newsboys are an awesome band and this is probably their bets cd. The rest of theirs are good also but this one Rocks!!!!
4,Newsboys Deliver,"""Take Me To Your Leader"" is one of those Christian rock albums that sounds unique enough to crossover into mainstream music, which is a good thing because you can't convert Christians if they've already converted. From silly songs like ""Breakfast"" to edgy rockers like ""Cup O' Tea,"" it's obvious that the Newsboys take their Christianity seriously, but know how to have a good time. ""Take Me To Your Leader"" is a fine addition to any Christian rock fan's collection. As a matter of fact, it fits pretty well into a secular rocker's bin too."
3,Single,"This is the CD Single for Take Me To Your Leader. Listed above is the tracklist for the full-length, but here is the one for the single:1. Take Me To Your Leader2. Take Me To Your Leader (Vocal Space Mix)3. Shine (Tom Lord-Alge Remix)4. Dear ShameThere isn't much to say; it's a CD single. But the remix of Shine is wonderful."
3,Buyer Beware!,"This is in reference to the CD single, not the album.On the plus side, the songs that are on the CD are fantastic - I would rate this 5/5 on song quality alone.HOWEVER!The big negative with this release is the claim that track 2 is a remix. IT IS NOT! I thoroughly searched for some difference compared to the album version to no avail. I don't know where the mistake took place in the production of the CD, but it is obvious. This is particularly unfortunate because the elusive ""Take Me To Your Leader (Vocal Space Mix)"" is unavailable elsewhere.Also keep in mind that track 3 is a simple EQ remix. Tom Lord-Alge did not add or subtract any sounds from the original mix. This is just a ""better"" mix, with more treble and wider stereo separation."
5,The Best Newsboys CD,"My youth group had this cd and I really wanted it because some of the songs I heard were good. When I got it I liked listening to it over and over again! They sing a lot about their faith and their music and lyrics are so good. Most of their songs are really rocky and I love the song Breakfast. It has a good tune and the lyrics are really good. I really like Reality, God is Not a Secret, Take Me to Your Leader, Cup O' Tea, It's All Who You Know and Lost the Plot. If you like Rock or the band Newsboys and never heard of this cd, you should get it! All the kids in my youth group love this cd!"
5,Sublime humour - intelligent wit...,"I love this band. Not because they're bold preachers in music, not because they're funny, not because they can do a superb play on words and still have the message remain the same; I love this band because they're A-one musicians and know how to make music.This album is a blast. It's got it all: pain, humour, wit, pensive ponderings, a rollicking good time. The Newsboys have a sound all their own, and it's distinct and pure. Some of the best music you'll hear and they're on the vanguard of the Christian music industry. I always look forward to new releases (these guys are a thinking man's band and they put their 'thinks' to purely enjoyable tunes).My fave cuts on this album are 'Take Me to Your Leader,' 'Breakfast,' and 'Breathe.' Get yourself a copy and enjoy."
4,Best Newsboys CD by far,"The newsboys have made the sounds of alternative/rock and christian music into one. Its a great cd, from the intensity and rock sounds of ""Lost The PLot"", to the more poppish sounds of ""Take Me To Your Leader"". IF you have listened to any of the other newsboys cd's, but you would like them to be a little harder, try this one. IT rocks, it shows that the newsboys have great depth. ""Lost The Plot"" is probably the hardest and the best song on the Cd if you like harder stuff. The message is great. They are great Christian musicians. If you are looking for good Christian rock, get this."
5,This album completes the trilogy.....,"The Newsboys 'Take me to your Leader' establishes itself along with Jars of Clay's self-titled album and DC Talk's 'Jesus Freak' as one of the three best Christian albums ever made. The Newsboys third release is a bit edgier than their previous efforts, as apparent in the first track, 'God is not a secret to be kept', as well as 'Breathe', 'Cup of Tea', and 'Lost the Plot'. Their dance/pop background still has an influence, and the title track, 'Reality', 'Breakfast', and 'It's all who you know' are as catchy as ever. Their lyrics have reached perfection, and are especially sharp in 'Let it Go', the most subdued of the songs, save for the benediction. I also think that it's the best song on the album- perhaps the best they've ever written. A brilliant effort by the Newsboys. God bless them all, for they are touching the hearts of many through their music."
4,Great reproduction,"First of all, this thing is HUGE; be sure that you will have a place to store it. Also, there is a lot going on with this model; plenty to paint, lots to glue, many many decals. I have been building models since I was a little boy and when I first opened this kit, I was somewhat daunted by all of the pieces. Needless to say I got right to work on it and had a blast. If you are going to put time and effort into this kit, it will take you quite a bit of time. There are some tedious parts that you will need to assemble including inserting all windows, assembling the deflector dish, and about 100 small decals. My only real problem with the model was that there were a few pieces that didn't quite line up exactly so that there were some gaps in the hull that I had to get creative to fix. However, if you put that time a effort into it, you will have a model that any Trekkie would be proud of."
3,Kitbashing made easy,"Using the smaller scall model of the NX-01 with the pylons casted seperate, made it easy to kitbash a 4 warp nacelle verson of the NX (or Enterprise) class of star ship."
2,Posers.,"Bought this disc after hearing a track on WFMU here in NYC. For a compilation of five mini-albums, it's quite uneven. The songs meander between 'one night with beer and a box of old records' to a 'day in daddy's garage'. They think they're referencing Mel van Peebles, Yoko etc. but after about 3 minutes...it just feels labored and, well, fake.I don't mean to rag too much on them. It's impressive that they're trying hard to break from their midwestern mold. But at the end of the day, it's a bunch of white boys who heard about the civil rights movement through Tarantino, whose understanding of the Black Panthers is defined through their great cover art.I can't help but feel that the bunch that makes up JWB hides behind a veil of bamboozled faux-homagery. If it were satire, it would be more interesting, but the album lacks that sense of self-deprecation. These guys want to be serious, and that's hard to buy."
1,Bile,"The lead vocals on this album have to be the worst that I have ever, ever heard. Musical abortion that sounds about as fake as they come. It just kind of seems like a band that ripped things off from other people to make their own stuff, but they didn't realized that Insincerity is so obvious in an album. For the love of god, don't buy this tripe."
5,THE BEST IN THE WORLD FOR A SINGLE GUY!!!,"First of I'm a single guy and part time father. This pan works great for cooking things that need to be mixed together (such as Hamburger Helper). The ability to be able to drain the meat, then pour the rest of the content in is great! The only problem is if I want to cook pasta, for just myself, the pan is to big! I have contacted WearEver to see if they can make the cook and stain stainless steel sauce pans with a nonstick surface. The stainless steel looks great!"
4,Review!,I like the lids to these pans! They save time! I really do not care for the non stick lining as I must watch what type utensil I use.
3,Pan that drains,I love the drain feature on this pan - which is why I bought it. The only drawback is that it is hard to clean around the fasteners for the handle on the inside of the pan.
1,"Stainless steel, non stick WearEver pan","This pan's non stick did not hold up well at all. I would much rather use their pots and pans that do not have a non stick coating because they hold up much better and work just as well. However, they told me that they do not make this pan without a non-stick coating on it. I am very disappointed in this pan. I do love their other products and will continue to use those but as for this pan, it is trash. I am currently looking for a new pan to replace it."
5,High quality,"This is high quality, much heavier than the red version. I love the Straining Lid. I've already ordered another one for a spare."
2,long lasting multi use pan,"we bought this pan from amazon about 2 years ago. it rapidly became our favorite cooking vessel.the strainer lid combined with a pouring spout proved to be useful in cooking a large array of dishes from ground beef concoctions to fried pork chops.the non stick coating finally wore off around the handle rivets probably due to higher temps around the stainless steel rivet area. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the lid handle/knob gets very hot,a problem wearever could easily solve. i will however, order a replacement today.UPDATE: I ordered a replacement on Feb. 10th 2012. This is Nov. 27th 2012 And the non-stick coating has already peeled rendering the pan useless. We used only plastic utensils with this pan. I will contact wearever but I don't expect much response from them,I'll let you know."
3,"Good material & fit, but no pockets makes it a non-starter for me.","These shorts are made of some very nice material, but they have not one single pocket! Now no matter where I go, I have to have my cell phone, keys and some money. Whoever thought a man's shorts didn't need pockets, obviously overlooked this fact. I therefore cannot recommend this product (unless you also carry a man bag)."
2,Whats with the supplement promotion?,"This book seems to have some pretty good information in it, so I'm not completley disappointed. BUT, I am so sick of having fitness experts try to cram supplements down my throat! I thought I was buying a no nonsense book from a world renowned strength coach, and what I ended up with was a sales catalogue for a nutritional supplement company. It even has pictures of several different products posted in the diet section of the book, with a 1-800 number at the bottom of each page so you can call and spend all your money on a bunch of candy bars and other junk that won't help you one iota with your training objectives. My advice: spend your money on something written by Stuart McRobert. The only thing he sells is good advice for the average weight lifter."
2,Disappointing...,"I've admired Coach Poliquin and his principles for years. He has an incredible amount of knowledge and his advice is backed by experience and science. That's why I'm shocked that he has let his name be associated with this ""book"". It's over priced, and the typographical errors are to numerous to mention. Parts of the workout section contradict themselves. Had I not already been familiar with the program presented, I would have been completely lost. The menu examples are so skimpy they shouldn't even be included. Save your money. Visit the Testosterone website instead."
2,Good Set of Routines....that's about it.,"The first few chapters are poorly written and endlessly bash aerobics. I got the point after the first few paragraphs. The workout routines and lifting technique illustrations are very useful. The rest of this paperback ""booklet"" is hype for a sports supplement company (veiled behind some suggested diet plans). I have a great deal of respect and confidence in coach Poliquin's knowledge and experience with muscle development. I'd buy it again for his workout routines alone."
3,Not up to charles's usual high standards,"This book may get you results as charles is at the top of his field, however this book is a typical recipe plan weight loss book. It is also obviously biased towards certain supplement companies products. If you are totally in the dark on exercise and weight loss maybe this is the book for you, but anybody with a knowledge of exercise and diet should skip this one. I cant speak highly enough about charles, but this book is not on par with his other publications."
3,Manly Weight loss,"This book is overpriced for the amount of information in it. I think the author could have offered more information on weight lifting , weight loss and calories etc. Too many ads for supplements also. I wish I could get my money back."
1,The Worst Advice Money Can Buy,"What a ridiculous and ignorant premise! If you want to look and think like one of those ""no pain/no-gain"" health club poodles, then go ahead and follow this fool's advice. Generating high concentrations of lactic acid in the muscle will only result in pain, stiffness, unnecessary fatigue, and loss of motivation. Truly scientific weight training means building muscle fiber by maximizing tension with heavy weights and by minimizing ATP losses, lactic acid buildup and injuries using low-rep sets. Anything else is pop-science garbage. Ignore this guy and seek out the advice of Pavel Tsatsouline in his excellent book, Power to the People: Russian Strength Training Secrets for Every American. I experienced his teaching first hand, and what you will learn from him will save you a ton of wasted time and money following the smug and stupid recommendations of the gym rat culture."
3,Cheap,"I didn't like the drawings and it just appeared to be cheaply made. The material is OK but the routines force you to take up 2 pieces of equipment at a time which isn't always possible. You can get the same adviceelsewhere. Besides this its great to hear someone say you don't need ""aerobics"""
1,"TRASH,TRASH,TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AWFUL","When I go this audiobook on 3 cds, ar first I was excited. Now, when I scanned the entire collection, it was horribly disappointed. The recordings were all bad and seemed like the company that made this didn't seemed to care. Every story was barely audible or nothing. Awful sounds of scratchings and scuffings were interrupting the narrators. I could not bare no longer and had to despose of the cds at once and purchased from from Audible.com to fill in the gape that this album had so rudely left me. DO NOT BUY THIS...............PEROID. Its badly recorded and badly manufactured."
1,Not a clear screen protector,"Be wary. The 3M Vikuiti film adds an unpleasant granularity to your screen. It is very much like you've applied a grain patten across the entire screen, with a sort of prismatic effect. Substantially degrades the readbility of a 5.6"" screen that is truly first-rate . . . until you apply the 3M Vikuiti screen protector.Good writing surface and applies easily, but the prismatic graininess this screen protector adds makes it a total loser.Jerry"
1,franklin towel boy rouh,"this first single off thier 1993 hit, meteora was the best ever. lincoln park is going to be the best for like 20 years. I finally got to see the video to this one, because i dont own a television. but if you want to save your money then buy the whole album, because you can get the hidden track, cwraling too, and it is great. my only complaint is why is the live version of somewhere i belong included on this? even though this is the censored version it is still a good buy. i cant wait till reanimation comes out, because i loved ""oops i did it again"". i think that this song was the real reason that limb bizkit sold 4 million alums of nellyville. meteora is the best reggae band out there, no matter how many copies nora carlton sells."
4,"Great pictures, could use more","A very good pictoral discription of native Ohio trees. Many of the trees have inset pictures of the bark, flowers, and fruit of the trees. Not all of them do - otherwise the book would have rated 5 stars. Arrangement of the entries is by leaf type and size which is very helpful."
3,Ghost Chase,"Like ""Twice Dead"" this is a not-so-great horror movie made essential by the appearance of Jill Whitlow. But if you want to see Jill at her best, check out ""Night Of The Creeps."""
3,BEWARE OF THIS EDITION IF YOU ARE BUYING THE BOOK FOR SCHOOL,"I bought this book for a graduate history class. As I began to write my paper for the class and got to the first citation i noticed that there are no page numbers. The other kindle books that I have bought have page numbers that correspond to the hard copy, but not this one. When I did some research I found that some e-books are paginated others aren't. Nothing to do but find a hard copy, which considering that its Sunday and the local library is closed not much chance of finding a hard copy. Very frustrating.Now. The book is very well written, enjoyable and informative. I encourage everyone who wants to understand the Civil Rights movement in the broader context to read it."
5,Like New Again!,"These will make you remember how your rear glass window worked when you bought the car. Our Liberty's rear glass (and hood) wouldn't hold themselves open anymore. I bought 2 for the window, replaced them in 2 minutes, and now they're like new again. Easy and cheap fix."
2,"Too powerful, and not smooth.","""Strongarm"" is the right name for these, as you'll need one to close the glass with two of them installed. They do also really snap the glass up fast, which is nice but also a little too powerful. Like the other reviewer, I think they put too much pressure on the hinges. Also, in the last inch or so of their extension travel, they make a grinding sound just before they reach the fully extended position. Overall quality is questionable, but it might be a you get-what-you-pay-for thing.."
