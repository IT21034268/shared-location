1,Don't waste your money.,"This was a total waste of money. Poor production, inaccurate discriptions and a total lack of respect in regards to correct pronunciation of ""Appalachia"". It's app a latch a, not app a lay shun!"
3,O Kay,"It was not as good as thought, The BBC products in similar subjects were for superior than the one I received."
3,"Excellent pack, sort of.","I really loved this gear when I had an FN-FAL, but I've switched to a DPMS LR-308 with Magpul magazines. The polymer Magpuls are enough bulkier than steel FN-FAL mags that they won't fit the pouches. A real drag, as this webgear is some of the best I've found for infantry patrol use."
4,Good mutual fund book for beginners,"That is THE book I am looking for!!! It is very easy to read and follow for beginners like me. It provides an overall review about the whole industry, major players, popular funds, and basic strategies. It emphasizes a lot on the importance of diversifying the portofolio and how to do that. The book serves well to prevent beginners from making BIG investment mistakes.Of course, it is a MORNINGSTAR book. It is all about Morningstar methods and tools. And I discovered that most of advanced tools recommended by authors are NOT free."
5,MorningStar User Guide,"I was so excited to find this book, after reading the usual junk, the classics, surfing hundreds of websites -- and yes, leaving lots of money on Brokers Conference Room Tables. {If only I knew then, what I know now.}It read fast, pulling so many ideas together in a very readable manner, backed up by authors who eat, sleep and process one of the best market data-sources around.My surprise was that it had elements of an adventure novel, by introducing me to the personalities and investment styles of Fund Managers. Suddenly the market, became real people. Annual Reports become chapters in an ongoing historical novel.Is it oriented to Morningstar? Sure, but that's not a bad thing for a new investor trying to re-gain control of his or her financial future. It makes a good companion, to the online data."
5,Informative Book for Everyone,"""Morningstar's Guide to Mutual Funds"" is the book for any investor, large or small. When my financial adviser would start discussing mutual funds, the NYSE, etc., my eyes would glaze over and my mind would wander. I never could understand the mumbo-jumbo he was throwing at me. Plus he never seemed able to explain why my portfolio kept sliding downward. So, I purchased this book in hopes of understanding more about investing and what I needed to do. This is clearly the book for me, and I am so thankful for such an edifying book about investing that makes it seem so simple."
3,Disappointing,There is no menu....if you don't watch it all the way thru...you can't watch it at all.
3,Nice book,Plan to read to grandchild when at an age to close eyes and conjure the images (since the book is all narrative). But lots of our old favorites.
1,Facsinating,"This story was pretty interesting and there was a lot of weird spots but the fairytales were very, very good partly. :)"
4,Good for children,Good for my child. She like to read it. And she always borrow my kindle. So maybe I'ld to buy other.
4,Fairy Tales Every Child should know,This story book brought back a lot of memory's. Some I had forgotten. I enjoyed sharing them with my Grandchild.
5,Great Read!,"Lots of great tales, some alot longer than I thought. Still a good addition to a childrens library. The stories span most of the globe."
5,Fairy tales every child should know,Awesome amazing I read this book for twenty days straight I didn't stop reading it but it was totally worth it
3,Child does not want to read it yet,"Undecided yet, 10 year old isn't compelled to read it yet. Will update the review after it is read. Thanks"
5,Awsome book!!,"I have heard some of them before but some like blue beard ,I really liked.I totally recommend this book for kids like me."
1,I expected it to be a book of fairy tales...,"I expected it to be a book of fairy tales, but it was a long, dry dissertation about fairy tales... boring and not at all what I expected."
2,Awful formatting,I was hoping to read this with my youngest but the formatting is awful. It all runs together sometimes. There's no breaks between stories. It's almost like someone copied it from one of them free sites and didn't bother to check it after.
4,Great Stories!!,This is a great book. I had heard some of the stories before but still like to read them.I read them at night. They are good bedtime stories.I like reading these stories when I don't want to read any of the other books on my Kindle. One of the best things about this book is that IT'S FREE!!!
3,Same old Same old,I thought these may have been new or different fairytales but they were the same old ones from our childhood. Disappointing.
3,"Small collection, modern light versions of the original stories and poor translation....","It's only 24 stories, the book is paperback and huge, uncomfortable to carry - or read - anywhere, except on your bed, the cover looks like it was copied by Joe WhoLivesWithHisMom. Very poor quality. Also, the stories are not the original versions, the grimm tales for example are all the dumbed down , censored versions that most people hear these days...not the original versions that actually had social messages and important points to make.And on top of that, the translation is very poor, I was pretty disappointed...but I still wanna read the stories."
3,We've enjoyed the fairy tales,"This is a good collection of fairy tales for American children. There were actually a couple I wasn't familiar with, and I was surprised how many my children hadn't heard yet."
4,fairy tales,"i never got this book nor do i never remembering ordering this book, if it was ordered then i wasn't me and some one used my account"
4,Fun to read,This book was fun to read with my daughter. I remember alot of the stories from childhood and it was fun to introduce her to them.
3,Okay,My grandmother read this book and she said it was okay wished there were more to the story and better climax.
4,Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know,This is a fabulous read. Every child should believe in a little magic. And a well lesson learned isn't bad either!
2,You get what you pay for.,"While this book is a nice collection of fairy tales in their un-Disney-fied original glory, the lack of Kindle navigation of any sort--others have mentioned the lack of ""clickable"" table of contents; the book also lacks chapter breaks--makes it a bit of a bear to use. If it weren't for the price, I'd tell everyone to take a pass."
4,Should be Fairy Tales Everyone Should Know,"I wasn't raised in a book-reading family and therefore my parents never read me the fairy tales. So, as I was planning my vacation reading list, I decided to add this book to it. It was a great vacation read as I could read as many, or as few, of the stories as I wanted at any given time. I now feel like I have a better understanding of these classic stories, instead of just piecing together references I have heard throughout the years. I really enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it. My only tale of caution is that some of the stories are quite violent so they may not be appropriate for small or senstive children."
1,Lots of cooked reviews,"The fact that so many of the 5 star reviews start with ""great' makes me wonder if there is no someone generating all these positive reviews. The volume does not include ""fairy tales every child should know."" It's just a random collection of old translations that are in the public domain, and there is no thought whatsoever given to age-appropriate tales. Do you really want to read a five-year-old the story of ""Bluebeard"" the serial wife-killer?"
5,Fun free book,"I loved the collection of fairy tales and I loved reading it with my kids, they are now bedtime story junkies and it's all changed how they choose to read."
3,Fairy tales,"We knew some of the fairy tales already, but it appears to me that this book is more for the US market as the spelling is US English and not Great Britain English!"
4,Nice collection for a perfect price!,"Great collection of stories at an early elementary reading level. That's why I went looking for a book in the first place -- I needed something my daughter could read, and as we'd already bought too many books that ended up at the wrong reading level, I was looking for something free. This fit on both counts! Lots of stories to choose from. Not illustrated, but that's almost better for us right now. Also not easy to navigate through but the kindle search (almost) makes up for that. I'm pleased with this collection!"
3,A set of old children's stories,"This contains a cross section of fairy, or better said, old children's stories, some of interest to elementary age children, others to sub-teen children. None are as I recall hearing when I was that age, but, oh well. I read them on my Kindle and had trouble on the selection. The listing was by chapters with no titles while the titled listing was not active to the stories. Price was right and nice to have around when the children or grand-children are bored and I can paraphrase to them or they can read themselves."
5,Perfect traditional stories!,"I love this book. I use this for bedtime stories with my son, who is 7. He loves hearing the classics. He even referenced the movie Shrek, which has Red Riding Hood, and he didn't know the story before. He said ""Now I get it!!"" My older daughter loves them as well and I love the reminder of my childhood. Definitely recommend to anyone with small kids or a sucker for nostalgia."
5,free,"what more could you ask for than free stuff for your kindle, always happy to get free stuff. More free stuff please."
3,great read for older children,I got this book with the intentions to read it with my five year old. It could not keep his attention and I honestly believe that it is a good book just for older children. I think he did not comprehend all that was going on.
2,Not mommy Book,"I was looking for a book to share with my baby. Not a book for my teenager to use for a school project. This book is not what I was looking to get for the young child in my home. That in mind, the older kids will read this book when needed."
2,horrible,I was looking for a book to read to my daughter at bedtime and this looked like the thing. Plus it was free. It's horrible. I can't keep up with the storys and they are way out of comprehension for some adult let alone a toddler. The storys are pretty good. Its the telling of them that's got them messed up.
1,I Was Not Pleased,"The stories in this book are in no way similar to the Fairy Tales I read and loved as a child. The stories in this book are unrecognizable, and a figment of someone's imagination who does not have a clue that Fairy Tales are for children. I will delete it from my Kindle. Amazon should not offer it!"
5,Mark,Easy to purchase the product and it was exactly as described. The product was delivered on time and secuely shipped. Plus it was a free download.
4,As an author one must read the classical fables and stories,"As an author many years ago I read many of the classical fables, fairy tales and stories and this helped give me and everyone else the foundationto create fiction."
3,Fairy Tales,"I haven't realy had a chance to read this book, but I heard it was a great book, so im looking forward to injoying fairy tales an maybe even read it to my nefpew"
1,"good stories, terrible delivery","if you want to read good fairy tales in a book, that is without any color, or any pictures, no numbered pages and a font that is small, than buy this book."
4,good story,this is a nice book with alot of good stories some of which I like to read to my Grandkids and some I just enjoy reading to myself.
3,Where is the navigation?,"I'm not a child, but I like fairy tales and I like this book.BUT... Where is the navigation?! It is absolutely impossible to find some sort of fairy tale in the book!My score can not be higher than 3."
4,Who doesn't love fairytales?,"This was fine, nothing spectacular. It's free, so I think it's worth a glance. Don't get your hopes up too high though, or else you'll be disappointed. It rounds out my Kindle library, so no complaints here."
3,Im not a reader,"I got this new phone that can do the Amazon Kindle. So I thought hey lets give it a try, so I dwn loaded a free book. I honestly have NVR read so it yeah."
2,Not so great,"Received this book thinking it was going to be a nice book to read to my kids. After getting it I was not very impressed. It looks like someone took it to Kinkos and made a thousand copies, put a cover on it and sold it for a way-over priced cost. I thought the book would have lots of pictures to go with the stories but there is only one black and white picture at the beginning of each story. There are lines through the pages like the copy machine malfunctioned as it copied. The only reason I kept this copy is for the story content. If you like to buy books for your children to enjoy I would not recommend this book as it is not very pleasing to the eye."
2,Got all the stories Wrong,"Well according to this book, Aladdin and Mustapha were in China..I am surely not going to recommend this book to anyone,The author should get her facts straight, unless she is claiming to write her own stories in this book,"
2,Fairy Tales Every Child Should NOT Know,"Note, these are the original stories. For adults, it'd be a 4-5 star review...a no frills adaptation of the original stories. But I gave it 2 stars because the title states that every child should know these. They may be classics, but my 4 year old does not need to know about the deaths and murders and darkness in the ""non-Disneyed"" original stories. The low rating is purely for a completely misleading title."
2,fairy tales every CHILD should know?,there were some nice stories in here but i noticed that they had a lot of murder and jealousy and bad stuff in it. i wouldnt read it to my kids....... i mean if i had kids that is.... :D
1,Different...,"Accidentally downloaded this book, but read it anyway! Found the stories to be very different than the original Grimms. Seemed to overlap various fairy tales, with strange details about a glass coffin for Snow White displayed on a hillside, etc. Very odd book...."
3,Didn't Read on Kindle,"This looks like a very interesting collection of stories, but I just couldn't read it on the Kindle. I learned quickly that I really prefer ""real books"". I don't want to talk negatively about this particular book since I ended up getting rid of my Kindle without reading it, I just don't like the Kindle version."
1,this is horrible,this book is degrading. do not read it to your kids. not worth the free price. people are shown in such negative ways.
4,cool book,I love this book. Its really fun and entertaining and i like to read it and my mom reads it to me all the time and i think its funny. lots of cool stories that all children would like listening to. you should buy it with your moms money
3,"Great Read for Adults, not so much for Kids","I downloaded this a while ago for my 8 year old daughter. She enjoyed only a couple of the stories. As a child of the Disney generation, her fairy tales have been very politically correct and harmless for the most part. This book was excellent in my tastes, however, it deeply disturbed her. After a few lines, she would ask me to choose another story. It scared her that there was so much violence and vengeance in the tales, and when I tried to explain that only recently have fairy tales been changed to be less scary, she decided that she liked hers, I could have mine."
2,no table of contents for kindle users,see the title. A 300 page book with no Table of Contents? It has many fairy tales but you can't search to each one!
4,Wonderful read aloud collection,"OK, so you will not want to hand this version to your child to entertain themselves with, as it is a 'no frills' collection. But, that has its benefits, like being the perfect excuse for you to read it to the children in your life. These classic versions are easily related to the more popular modern fairy tales young children know so well. The book begins with ""One Eyes, Two Eyes, Three Eyes,"" which your kids may recognize as ""Cinderella,"" and ends with ""Beauty and the Beast."" These may not be Disney versions and they lack illustrations, but they easily captivate young and old alike."
4,Fairy Tales Review,"I love this book! It is so much fun to revisit the fairy tales I was told as a child and to read them to my children. This book isn't the fluff of Disney, and we all knew there was so much more (or less)to these stories than what Disney shows. Adults will love this book. Kids who aren't raised on happy the 'endings for everyone' mentality will also love it. Great read."
1,"Mishmash -- Old, Dated, indexless lifts -- Avoid",These are dated archaic lifts which I foolishly acquired to read to a 6th grade class.Avoid this volume --the renditions are unreadable.
3,No Frills Fairy Tales,"This is collection of well known fairy tales by Grimm's and others, with an introductory on the history and importance of fairy tales for children. Most of them would benefit from illustrations, but if you just want the text, it's fine. Since I plan on handmaking a picture-book for my nieces, it suits my purpose. I do wish the Table of Contents was clickable, however.The book includes:One Eye, Two Eyes, Three EyesThe Magic MirrorHansel and GrethelThe Story of AladdinThe White CatThe Second Voyage of SinbadThe Golden GooseThe Twelve BrothersTom ThumbCinderellaPuss in BootsBlue BeardSleeping BeautyJack and the BeanstalkLittle Red Riding HoodJack the Giant KillerThe Three BearsThe Princess On The PeaThe Ugly DucklingBeauty and the Beast"
4,"NAVIGATION OF ""FAIRY TALES EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW"" KINDLE VERSION","Navigation for this ebook as well as others without active table of contents is simplified by adding your own highlight on the story title or chapter # as it first comes up. I got this version yesterday eventhough my wife has it on her kindle and complained about no table of contents. Last night as I was reading the stories, I highlighted the story title as if first appeared on the screen. After doing this several times, I went to view your notes/highlights, and lo and behold there they were with location # and title, highlight the title and press the 5 way control and you are now at the beginning of the story..... great for re-reading those stories to those grandkids who always want to hear the story again and again and again.Hope this helps to all who are concerned about ""No Active Table of Contents""."
5,Great purchase,The book was great and it had all of my childhood stories so I was very very excited to get it.
5,Amazing!!!!!,I am always fond of fairy tales.These are the best tales I have ever read.They teach us not to be selfish.
2,Review,Free download the pop star games for the pop star games for the pop star games for the pop star games for the pop star games for the pop star games for the pop star games for the pop
3,Brings back all your childhood favorites!,Everything in the book just as you remembered reading the stories as a child! Wonderful reading with/ or to yourlittle ones. Great to give them when they're old enough to read and understand them on their own. A great buy.
4,Good stories,"This book is packed with various fairy tales. Some I've heard of, other I haven't. I wanted this book to read to my niece when she's a little older. It's nice to have them all in ones spot. The kindle version is a little jumbled together though so if you want a quick reference you'll have to mark it yourself."
5,Fairy tales every child should know,Omg I love this book. There are some fairy tales I did not know and some I did know and I love it
3,Childhood memories,"Reading this book took me back to being a little girl and hearing them for the first time. Great read, and will stir your imagination."
4,good,Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.
4,lotsa performance for the price,"Hi,I actually still use this system everyday and bought it 4 years ago or so. I am using a 50"" plasma, a HD-DVD player, an Xbox 360, and a kareoke player with this theater system.I want to upgrade it to a receiver that processes TrueHD audio and have been very pleased with it thus far.If you want a receiver with lots of audio hookups(I don't use video inputs on A/V receivers) and don't want to spend much, then this RCA RT2580 should hold you over til you spend more..."
2,Don't buy it if you have a PALM M125,"I'm very disappointed with the product because although it says that the Kit is for ""Palm m100/m105/m125"" neither the stylus nor the screen protectors fits the m125 size. It's not fair that from an offering of 4 products I finally used just two of them!"
3,Palm,"This review is a day late and dollar short.This product isn't even sold any more. When I DID use it, it was good."
3,Straight From the Gate But Without any Direction,"The album starts out well with Straight From the Gate, a funky funkaldelic influenced groove, however, from that point on it fails to deliver. By the end, the album has become a little too cheesy for my tastes. Regardless, the first six tracks minus Ms. Yum Yum are great tunes. The addition of Derrick Youmam on vocals is a good one, but he needs more space to shine. The Headhunters are unarguably class A musicians but keyboardist Paul Potyen's jazzy style conflicts with Blackbiyrd's Hendrix influenced guitar playing. However, the reason I bought this album is for the drumming. As an avid Mike Clark fan I would dutifully buy any album he played on. Clark is one of the most underrated drummers of all time and has laid down some of the funkiest syncopated grooves ever. Anyone who enjoys his playing on this album should check out Thrust, the solo on Actual Proof is unreal."
5,Hilarious AND Informative!,"Mr. Boteach's book, The Dating Secrets of the 10 Commandments caught my eye at a bookstore. I sat for a full hour and read as much as possible...and I loved it! Not only is it well-written, with a narrative and personal touch that gives the reader a sort of relationship with the author, it's actually a helpful tool in improving your attitude on dating. Usually, I skip over the personal stories of authors in books about dating, and/or any other subject, yet I laughed aloud as I read Boteach's thoughts and viewpoints on finding a soul-mate, especially from the Jewish perspective. If you are Jewish, this book will be probably more enjoyable for you since you can really relate to what Boteach is saying about the relationship between being Jewish and having a social life. I recommend this book even if you aren't looking for a soulmate! It's entertaining, interesting, and enjoyable!"
4,"Something of value even for ""non daters""","I picked this book up only because of the odd juxtaposition of the two concepts in the title. It has many good tips for guiding you towards more fulfilling relationships in general, not just with your ""date."" It made me appreciate and see the commandments in a whole new way. I concur with the other reviewer that there is too much schtick in the book. I enjoyed the some of the humor, and it did make certain points hit home. However after a while it got repetetive and distracting. If you can ignore the irrelevant jokes, you can find some real gems of spiritual advice for guiding your life based on the big 10. I would especially recommend this book to a guy who is looking for a meaningful relationship with a woman, perhaps leading to marriage. This answers the question, ""What do women want?"""
5,This book is excellent,"Rabbi Boteach is both wise and funny That combination makes each of his books truly special -- and is why I stop everything to read them when they come out. For those who want to be enlightened and entertained, this is the book to read."
2,Tiresome,"This book tries to connect the ten commandments to dating and is not too successful as the connection is very loose. This is one of those books that are way too long (about 300 pages), but mostly because it is repetitious and somewhat preachy annoying probably since it is written by a Rabbi. It is also very righteous, maybe too righteous (is that possible?) also because it is written by a religious person. It started out ok but grew very tiresome at the end that I cannot wait for it to finish. The grammar is bad, very bad. I give it a few stars though because it did had some good content that you can use for dates but having to filter those useful tidbits from 300 pages is no fun at all."
1,"A bad, boring, but above all predictable book.","Old fashioned SF at its worst.Maybe it was published as adolescence fiction way back when, but it must've been decades since even adolescents found this kind of stuff exciting. Probably the most predictable book I ever read, not that I managed to work through all thee episodes. The whole thing is extremely narrow-minded, totally america-to-the-stars 50s machismo."
3,not packaged as I expected,it was a 3 pack with a roll...not as it was featured on the pic...i just hope that rolls of film are in good condition.
2,Didn't receive what I ordered,"First off, this vendor apparently doesn't ship the product they advertise. While the product description clearly shows Fuji HQ, what I got was just plain old Fujicolor; not the same film at all. That kinda sucks. And from reading other reviews here, that seems to be the way they roll.Now, to keep things in perspective, it's not the end of the world. Rather than go through the hassle of returning the film (which after all was only about $8), I'm going to try it out. How bad could it be? I know Fuji makes good film in general. And the other good thing was that the film was well within its expiration date (my film was dated 2014, plenty of time to go), unlike some vendors who ship outdated film.But really, guys, if you show HQ, you ought to ship HQ, or change your description to match what you actually send. Otherwise, this is a deceptive sales practice. I know HQ is good, since I used it for years: it remains to be seen if Fujicolor measure up or not."
1,Expiration Date Too Close!!!!,Warning!!! Do Not Buy This Product!!! Expiration Date Too Close!!!! ( 2 months for 4 cartridges) And you will lose too much money to justify sending it back to them!!!
1,I bought wrong item but couldn't return for exchange.,Shipped very promptly but discovered it wasn't APS film. Tried to return but never heard back from vendor.
4,Great film,Great film for a great price. My photog cousin loves this so I keep getting it as a gift for her on holidays!
4,"Good film, but prices here are way too high.","For an all-purpose color film, I nearly always shoot Fuji's 200 speed. It has the cooler tones that I prefer in my images and a good saturation level. The only drawback that I've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced! The only place that I've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets. Any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less, and you won't have to wait for it to ship."
4,Review improper channels,"Excellent fun, movie that has aged very well, I enjoyed seeing it again. Recommend.Hopefully I have added a photo of the little girl all grown up!"
3,Life for a Fair Maiden,"The King's Bed is a tale about choices and struggle. Tansy Marsh is the daughter of an inkeeper, but undergoes many stuggles and losses in her days. Her experiences are ones that we all can relate to, from a demanding stepmother to choosing a husband, even how to keep her business afloat. It takes you through a war, and the sacrifices that Tansy must endure for her family and for herself. It also takes you through the post war era, where she deals with family loyalty and her new husband mastering his trade. This book is captivating and enticing. I recommend this book for young adults who love a little bit of historical literature."
4,Warlock Series,"Rod Gallowglass. Fess. Gwen. All the favorites are back in this larger, combined book, so you get more for your money. If you like this series, you'll appreciate this edition."
2,"Flimsy, unfoldable with Playhut's instructions.","It doesn't stay anywhere near as taut, straight and firm as the picture appears. Merely brushing up against the side starts it collapsing in on itself, requiring parent's help to straighten it all out again. There are no ""loops"" under the roof as the assembly instructions direct you to for the stabilizer tube (which doesn't stabilize). The ""loops"" are actually a narrow tube sewed in the TOP of the roof. Folding is nearly impossible. Do an internet search for ""toy enthusiast"" from Jacksonville, FL for truly easy folding that playhut doesn't come anywhere near to. This toy was a gift, if I had purchased it myself, I'd return it. I understand other (older) Playhut items are good quality. This one isn't."
1,WARNING! POSSIBLE DEATH TRAP!,"My husband and I purchased this tent for our 3 year old for Christmas. She loves Dora and Boots and wanted a tent and sleeping bag just like her big brother. This seemed perfect. Just like the others mentioned, it did fall while she was playing in it but she learned quickly how to fix it and set it back up. She would play in it for hours if we let her (that is the reson for the 3 stars for fun) Long story short, the first night that she slepted in it, it colapsed on her while she was sleeping. Her head and face were completly covered. The sleeping bag, we kept. The tent on the other hand, well our daughter's story goes...""Dora and Boots needed it for all of their adventures so mommy and daddy did mail it to her. But, my brother does let me sleep in his tent"" (word for word)My advice let the kids camp out under your dining room table with a Dora sheet over them. Sure bring the Dora sleeping bag along too, but leave that death trap of a tent alone!"
2,Don't waste you rmoney,Flimsy and cheap - don't waste your money. Doesn't stand on it's own. My toddler keeps knocking it over and gets frustrated with it. Plus no air flows through and it gets VERY HOT inside. Spend a few extra bucks and get something with mesh and a floor so it is a little more stable.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought two of these, one Dora and one Disney. They just won't stand up. And the instructions are awful. A big waste of both time and money! I kept the flimsy sleeping bags and tossed the rest out. Very disappointed."
3,Entertaining but not very sturdy,My 2 year old daughter loves it but the only problem is it is not very sturdy.It keeps falling down every now and then.
2,beauty is skin deep... ugly goes all the way through,"On the surface, Boy Meets Girl is a beautifully shot film... sort of a classic film noir meets French new wave. But scratch off the artistic cosmetics and this is one ugly boring waste of time. Lots of pretentious babble and angst. Unlikable characters and a plot so uninteresting, I just wanted to hit the fast-forward button. Leos Carax has some talent and smarts (check out Pola X and Les Amants du Pont Neuf) but this ranks up there as a throw-away."
5,Annabell the Great!,"My daughter age 3, first saw this doll over a friend's house and would not put it down. So, like most parents that spoil their children, I ran out the next day and bought her one...She loves ""Baby Annabell"" and really treats her like a real baby. However, I should have shopped around first before purchasing it Toys R Us. Since my purchase, I have seen Baby Annabell for...less...at...other stores."
4,great doll for all ages,"i bought this doll for my 2 year old, and she's crazy about it (as is her 5 year old brother!).i find she doesn't cry that much, she starts laughing after about three repeats of the recording. also, if you don't interact with her for a minute, she turns off.she has great mouth movement when drinking/sucking and makes appropriate noises. the snoring noise is a little bizarre though (just my opinion, as the kids think it's great).my only complaint is that the clothes have started to look a little tatty after only a week.i would buy this doll again if i started over."
5,Baby Annabell is my all time favourite toy!,"Well, I got this toy 3 years ago, when I was 6. now, I am 9 and I love my little baby! I bought her an outfit. only one though, because I don't have enough money for another one. i don't have an e'mail address and looked at all the other reviews. Mattel, you are kind, because I don't have to write my e-mail. now, onto the toy. THIS TOY IS SO FUN! It didn't take me long to fall in love with her. Parents, instead of the other dolls, get this one for your little angel because this dolly is very sweet and fun! I've got to review more toys. get this doll and you'll find yourself writing a review about how good little Annabell is! Bye!!!! Oh, by the way, what does LOL mean? can somebody just take a little time to say ""Esther, Lol means .........."" Ok now I really am saying bye, BYE!"
5,Birthday Present for Katie,"For my daughter's 4th birthday, we purchased Baby Annabell, for her. She had a baby shower as her party. This baby doll is a lot of fun. My 6 year old really loves it. We will be purchasing another one for Christmas. When Baby Annabell cries, she makes you want to run over to her and pick her up. I just wish that her eyes would close, when she is turned off. My daughter doesn't notice. She just pretends. Other than that she is perfect."
2,Baby Annabell doll has little value for big money,"Baby Annabell is very difficult to function for my 4 year old daughter(package says 3+) and even I had a hard time figuring out the functions. The arms are flimsy and the body is hard. This is not a cuddly, educational doll at all. I would highly recommend Little Mommy as she is very educational and easy to function. For half the price you can get Little Mommy and you will have the value for your money."
4,Baby Annabell Doll,"My daughter plays with Annabell some, but her friends (ages 2-4)love it. It is the first thing they want to play with when they get here, and they play with it for hours!"
3,Really neat,"My daughter enjoyed this doll when she first received it. After a few months, she didn't play with it again. She has never really been in to dolls but for a girl that likes dolls, I would recommend it. Very life like."
5,"Great, durable doll!","We've had this doll for over two years. We bought it when my daughter was not quite three. She LOVES it! She still hauls it around regularly, and amazingly we have not lost the accessories. If there is a down side it is that when she is in play mode she never stops making some kind of noise (talking, sucking, babbling, spitting). This is quickly remedied by switching her off in the back. No worries! This doll has stood the test of time at our house, and that is saying something with all the toys to choose from! I would HIGHLY recommend! She's been dropped many times and continues to be in good working order. Also, the batteries don't seem to run out too fast.... in fact, I can't remember the last time I changed them! It's a GREAT doll!!! Your little mommy will love it!"
3,Annabelle sleeps with her eyes open,"I love my doll except she goes to sleep with her eyes open. But I got a new baby I hope she goes to sleep with her eyes closed!Love,a liitle girl who likes dolls"
3,o gosh!,"Today I went to 3 diffrent stores looking for this doll. Of course it's Christmas time and Santa had alot of kids to buy for and this is the hot ticket item, but it's not good! We finally found it at a Super Target store and I went to hold the box and I felt the baby and it was very hard and it doesn't look like a real baby at all! It just looks like a regular doll. I was not happy about this at all. I wrote another message earlier (probubly right below this message) and you can tell how my feelings changed about this doll. I don't want to make your hearts sink on this, but I was NOT impressed!"
5,Sounds Great,"I dont have this doll. I am basing it on the reviews. So far every review has a good outcome. I have been looking for a new doll.One that looks real and really isnt that exspinsive. All of my friends have really exspinsive baby dolls from Ashton Drake. Dont get me wrong I want one. But the problem is my birthday has already passed and I would have to wait until CHRISTMAS wich is 6 monts away! And let me tell you rasing 150$ for an Ashton Drake doll is going to be hard. So I decided to raise about 50$ instead! I am seariosly thinking about getting this doll. From what I hear this is an awesome awsome doll compared to CHOU-CHOU I am going to read the BABY born reviews next. Sounds like a great doll! Bailey,Age 10"
3,Baby Annabell Doll,"I received the baby Annabell for my daughter in the mail today. The doll is in good condition, however the way it was packaged was terrible. The box was mangled and I am surprised it was okay. I think my daughter will love this doll, but she will have to wait until Christmas :-)"
4,"Sweet doll, poor packaging.","This doll was delivered today. It is a Christmas gift, but I wanted to try it out before giving it to my daughter. It came in a generic white box with black print, not a box like you would find at an actual Toys-R-Us store. The doll is cute and does make baby-like noises. The motor (for lack of a better word) is rather loud when the baby sucks, though. The doll seems to be well made. Overall I think this baby will be well received by my four year old."
5,Absolutely Stunning!,"I purchased this for my 5 yr old daughter as a Christmas gift. Upon receiving it, I had to take it out and play with it (I was just making sure she'd like it, I swear!). This doll is absolutely amazing. I was demonstrating how she works to my husband and removed her bottle mid-feeding and she started to cry. I couldn't make her stop crying till I sang to her! He was highly amused that I didn't just use the ""off"" switch. I can't wait to give it to my daughter as I know that it will be a new favorite. And it's much less annoying than a real baby sister. ;)"
5,Omg i love this doll,I hav watched the product video 1000 times(the product video is 100 percent true) i love this doll i always wanted a doll tha t could do things like this i think the price of this doll is way to much money but anyway i love this doll and i neaver stop playing with it !!!!!for all u doll lovers this is for sure the doll to get it is just like a real baby!
3,CUTE BUT WATCHOUT FOR FALLING PARTS,THIS DOLL WAS VERY CUTE. WE LOVE IT. OUR TWIN DAUGHTERS PLAY WITH THEM ALOT. HOWEVER THE DRAW BACKS ARE: (1) THE OUTFIT ON THE DOLLS ARE CHEAP MADE TAG CAME OFF THE FRONT OF ONE. THEY NAP UP VERY BAD. AND TEND TO ALWAYS LOOK DIRTY. THE NECK OF THE DOLL IS SO BIG IT IS HARD TO FIND CLOTHES TI FIT IT. AND (2)THE PLATE ON THE BACK OF THE DOLLS HEAD FALLS OFF AND LEAVES A BIG OPEN PLACE IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. WHEN I WROTE THE ZAPF COMPANY WAS TOLD THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS. AND I COULD EITHER TAKE THE DOLL BACK FOR A REPLACMENT OR COULD SEND TO THEM FOR A REPLACMENT OR COULD CRAZY GLUE BACK ON MYSELF. (3) THE NIPPLES ON THE BOTTLES BEND AND MAY BREAK OFF. [IF YOU DON'T ]REPLACE THEM YOU HAVE SOME VERY ANGERY DOLLS.
5,LOVE this doll!!!,"Baby Annabelle is WONDERFUL!!! I can't wait till Christmas to give her to my daughter.I had bought Chou Chou at first, but returned her after trying her out. She was cute, but my problem with her is that once she starts ""sighing"", you HAVE to rock her to sleep in order for her to wake back up again. And you have to rock her pretty hard too..lol..I thought this would be too hard for my 2 1/2 yr. old.Annabelle is just so sweet!!!! She makes the CUTEST noises and is also not as heavy as chou-chou. She is definetly worth every penny spent!!!!"
1,mis-led on description,"This was presented as the Barbara Streisand concert from Madison Square Garden, but was not. Should have known better than to use this Amazon.com site. Now I have a video tape that I don't want. Chalking this one up as a lesson learned , never buying anything from this site again."
5,Long Overdue,"Fianlly there is a realistic book about being single that is worth reading. Marc and Joan share their different voices in concert resulting in a book filled with spirit, knowledge, honesty and humor. It can make a mother proud enough to stop pushing marriage when it isn't in the cards. Highly reccommend."
5,A New Dawn,"Inspirational, guiding and at times comforting. A bedside companion...a new found friend...a cat without the fur."
2,Difficult switching mechanism,"This stylus has a normal looking button at the top for extending/retracting the various tips. In order to switch between the PDA tip, the pen tip, and the pencil tip you must push this button at the top in 1 of 4 directions as you push it down. This is awkward and sometimes doesn't work correctly. I will sometimes get the pen when I expected the PDA tip, which could cause some serious screen damage.Also, the button sometimes seems to get jammed up and you have to let go and try to push it down again. I ended up removing the pen and the pencil and now only use the pda pen.Not worth the money in my opinion."
1,Bad Buy,"I thought I would use this pen as a replacement for my Belkin 4 in 1, Bad Bad idea. The black started peeling off within a week of having this stupid pen. Black and Red ink is no good (fade away). Stay away from this pen."
2,"Paint peals off, low ink quality, merely adequate","Cons:- The black paint where you hold the pen peels off, you are leaft with an unsightly yellowish copper color.- Black and red ink are bad quality and fade in an out. Red in my pen is actually intermittement.- The cap at he top is too tall and sticks out noticably.Pros:- Better than the skinny stylus.________________________________Bottom line. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Worst universal stylus,"I have misplaced my 3-in-1 Stealth from Platinum pen company and started using the iConcepts pen that I have got as a present. It was a nightmare. Black inc was not working right out of the box (I had to replace it), the pencil broke in about 5 days and the stylus part was sticking out of its place every second time, so I have to disassemble the pen to stick it in. In about 10 days of use the black and silver pain that covered the pen started peeling out making it looking awkward. I have struggled a month with it and just yesterday found my misplaced Stealth. What a difference! The iConcepts went to garbage same day. If you like multi-functional pens, avoid this one, use Stealth instead."
1,No CD No Buy,"I bought the Panther edition of this book, and found it contained a great deal of useful information. However, I felt it did not serve well for a reference material for two reasons...1. This book is huge. It needs to be perfect bound or made into two separate volumes.2. Though the index is quite extensive, there is no way to adequately search the book for troubleshooting Mac OSX.Both points would be obviated by the inclusion of a CD containing an ebook, preferably as a PDF. I reported this to the publisher, but apparently they disagree since this version does not include a disc. For this reason, I have decided not to purchase this book until future editions include this. I'm writing this here in hopes that the publisher will read this, and act accordingly."
4,Really Fine Coltrane,"Not his best. But a lovely post-bop effort. Lush Life is nice, but the other tracks are just as good. Recommended."
4,Lovely early Coltrane mix,"I don't know how well regarded this Coltrane album is, but it is damn good. From the opening spiraling of ""Like Someone In Love"" the album is a nice mix of different playing styles. To begin with, the first 3 tracks don't even have piano, but when Red Garland finally does appear on the title track, he gives the song beautiful sprinkles of delicate piano while Trane and guest trumpeter Donald Byrd hang on the melody and render it gently for almost 14 minutes without every boring the listener. ""I Love You"" mixes Coltrane's funky playing with a latin drum arrangement.One thing is for sure, Coltrane was always trying new things, and he certainly knew how to pick musicians to accomplish such, especially his two steady pianists (Red Garland & McCoy Tyner). A good mix of styles in a classic jazz album."
5,A timeless jazz classic,"Among the considerable body of fine work by master saxophonist John Coltrane, ""Lush Life"" certainly stands out. ""Like Someone in Love"" and ""I Love You"" are given exquisite readings, and the Coltrane original ""Trane's Slo Blues"" is a not-so-slow delight. The fact that his reading of the jazz classic ""Lush Life"" clocks in at over thirteen minutes without wasting one second says something about the power of Coltrane and the gifted musicians that back him, such as the incomparable Red Garland on piano on the title track and ""I Hear a Rhapsody."" Gorgeous readings of classic tunes and another innovative angle of Trane's artistry make ""Lush Life"" a must-have for any fan of jazz."
1,Blacks out after 15 months,"I purchased a computer package that included the hp vs15 15"" monitor. I loved it while it worked the first year. 3 months after the year warrenty, the screen started flickering for a couple of days than eventually blacked out. Contacted HP and of course they told me that there was nothing they could do except send me to a sight to find a place to get it repaired. I really expect a monitor to last longer than a year for the price that they run. Will not purchase HP again."
1,Blacks out right after warranty,"I had the exact same experience as Sharon. I received the HP vs15c as part of my package deal for a new HP computer. 1 month after the warranty expired on my monitor, the screen flickered for one day, and then by the days end it would no longer turn on. Customer service was of no help at all, and said that I would need to purchase a new one. Fortunately, I had purchased it with an Amex card, which offers buyer protection, and they credited me for the original price of the monitor. Now I'm going to go and get a new one, and I don't plan to buy HP!!"
4,A Must have for all Disciples!,"I recently took a class at a church which used this book as its text. This book is extremely helpful for learning how to disciple others. My experience with the church has been an attitude of ""Just Do It!"". As Christians we are called to witness, called to disciple, but rarely receive any real training. This book is a great tool for training and helped me feel more comfortable with not only sharing the gospel but guiding others in their walk.A must have for all disciples!"
4,Basketball Review,"Great product after we finally got it put together, Its was very difficult and for sure you will need 2 people. Instructions were not much help. Good Luck"
2,Rusty,For the first year hoop was excellent. After year one though product went down hill. started to rust horribly. rim started leaning and left a stain on the concrete. If you plan to only use it for a year I would get it anything over a year I would get another hoop.
2,LIFETIME?,The overall construction of the item is good upon first impressions. I have had the BAsketball set for a few years now and it is garaged when not in use in the Winter. The metal pole and actual steel basketball hoop are rusting horribly. You have to be careful for staining on pool deck because of the large abmounts of dripping rust. The powdercoating finish not a lifetime poroduct. This is occuring in a regular pool and not caused by a salt based pool.I would not purchase this product again for the money and would look for something else.
4,pool hoop,"Nice hoop, on lowest setting standing in pool I can barely touch the rim, Im 6' 1"" . Would be nice to be able to adjust it a little lower for small kids. besides that it is great."
3,Great Item but tough to put together,Love the final product but directions were not well written and it was a bear to put together.It is also very heavy so I needed another person to help toward the end when securing the rim and backboard.
3,Disappointed,"Lifetime ? AFter 3 weeks poolside, hardware (bolts provided) are rusting badly. Other than the rust problem, happy with purchase."
4,Great Product,This is a stirdy BBall hoop. I made my own years ago by just taking out the middle pole of an above ground set. This was similar but a little taller. You also get a ball which was a surprise. Best for older kids.
2,Not good quality,"I didn't want to give this product 1 star because I figured that someone works hard building these units everyday and they deserve respect. Maybe, I some how got a defective one. The latch that is supposed to keep the bagger attached to the sweeper unit will not stay attached. Especially, as it starts to fill up with leaves. Everytime it filled up, the bagger would detach making the unit useless. I got so frustrated that I just detached the entire thing and threw it behind my shed. I put my regular grass catcher bagger on my tractor and ended up just cutting the grass and sucking up the leaves that way. This purchase seemed like a good idea but clearly wasn't a good idea."
3,It's ok.,"Hard to push, a little touchy how you hold it and must frequently go over the same area twice to remove all the clippings. I wish now that I had bought one to pull behund the lawn tractor."
3,Ohio Steel Lawn Sweeper,"What are you suppose to do with the tension bars. There are no holes for them to fit in the top bar42""/18 Cubic Foot Lawn Sweeper."
4,Take the course...,"If you take the course then you get the book too. And, since Ott is a good lecturer, you will likely learn a lot more than trying to read the book.For packaging engineers like myself, this book is not worth the money. You would be better off buying Blackwell's ""The Electronic Packaging Handbook"" which has an excellent chapter covering all important aspects of EMC. For Electrical Engineers I suspect what you have in your ""High Speed Digital Design"" (Johnson and Graham) will be more than adequate.The real issue is simply too much information. I agree with Ott that some understanding of antennas is needed to understand EMC but not nearly the amount covered in this book. I think that Ott's ham radio hobby has caused him to overdo that material in this book.I highly recommend taking the course but I suspect if you buy the book you won't finish reading it."
4,"Noise Reduction Techniques In Electronic Systems, 2nd Edition Books",These books were excellent for the work that is now performing in our line of work.
2,Minor Christie,"Very amateurish in many ways. In fact, it takes a crook writing a long letter to the ""detectives"" to help comprehend the previous goings-on. I still found the text convoluted and at times incomprehensible. Christie was slumming here."
2,My least favorite AC,"I have read over 50 of Agatha Christie's books. My goal is to read all of them. I was anticipating with pleasure the reading of this book because of the good reviews that it has received. I was very disappointed. There were far too many characters, and it was hard to keep them straight. The protagonists Bobby and Frankie were not particularly likeable. The mystery of who Evans was also turned out to be a disappointment. I had to force myself to finish it."
5,Absolutly the best book ever - it made me a fan of Christie!,"The plot is amazing and I found the detectives(Bobby and Frankie)witty, brave and altogether fun. The villin is a perfect one, one I never would have suspected. This book was complex and held my intrest great. It and ""Sleeping Murder"" (another Christie) made me a complete fan of hers-dispite her boring books(Like ""What Mrs. Mugillacudy Saw"" and ""Easy to Kill"") Also check out ""And Then There Were None""-also amazing. By the way, I am very picky, and if I like it, these books must be good!!"
2,Not her best,"I didn't enjoyed it very much. Althought you wonder all the time who really did it and why, it has some scenes that are too much incredible."
5,Great comprehensive book,"This book is structured really well and gives a comprehensive view of managing translation services. Lots of tips and practical advice from someone who has actually done that. Highly recommende for freelancers wishing to take the ""next step"" and develop a translation agency."
3,The life and death of a U. S. nuclear submarine.,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I found this book a good read for those interested in submarine life. There were some typos in the book, but the reader could figure out what Polmar is trying to say. This book was originally written in the sixties, and was brought up to date with other submarine accidents. What is covered is one of the most tragic U.S. Navy accidents. Polmar covers the short life of this nuclear submarine, and why she may have went down.By now, most people have heard about the Russian submarine Kursk and her fate. The U.S. Navy suffered a similar tragedy in 1963 with the loss of 129 men and the U.S.S. Thresher. What is interesting is the way Admiral Rickover (Jimmy Carter's mentor) is pictured in this book. It seems Rickover tried to cover up for any failure of the nuclear powerplant in the Thresher. Polmar does an alright job in making the technical data interesting."
4,interesting book.,"this is an interesting book, easy to read. It gives abit of submarine history, plus the story of the Threasher."
1,Makes Me Nervous...,when reading non-fiction to find both sloppy errors (p. 152 has Wilhelm Bauer working on a submarine in 1851 and building another in 1955) and questionable scholarship (a check of the Swedish submarine website re: Bauer). Can we trust the information in the rest of the book especially since there are no footnotes much less references?
5,Rich true color for a film in this range,"Fuji film produces beautiful colors at a very low price without compromising quality. This is a great all around film on sunny days and for dawn/dust shots on a tripod. Since this is a slow speed film with very fine grain, it's ideal for enlargements."
3,DVD review only -NO movie comments,"If you are reading this review then I assume you like the movie and know the storyline and characters. MY personal opinion is not really relevant.However, the DVD itself is another matter. If you ARE into this movie then grab this DVD. The transfer to DVD is great, and this is the sort of movie you don't need a cinema sized screen to enjoy, just turn it on on a rainy day, grab a cup of tea and sit down.My only quibble is the lack of features, pretty standard."
4,Excellent foreign movie but sound-sync defective,"This is a beautifully filmed, scripted and acted movie. It was directed by the same director of ""To Begin Again/Volver a Empezar"" (1982). However, many non-spanish speakers might not have noticed this, but the spanish language soundtrack (the original language of this film) is out of sync with the video. I contacted Miramax and they sent me another copy of the DVD. It had exactly the same problem. It is a shame that such a beautiful film was produced without adequate quality control. I almost gave it 3 stars because of this defect; but this is not the fault of the artists."
1,Grandfather- Sound disaster,"I purchased this dvd because it is so rare to find a good film that is rated PG. The soundtrack was so bad that I had to stop watching it. The children's voices sound like they are done by adults- badly. This may be a good film, but I will never know because the dvd isn't worth watching. It sounds like it was dubbed into Spanish, but that is the original language."
4,Powell Books,"I ordered 3 Sunset cookbooks from this vendor (Sunset Classics-8 Cookbooks in 1, Sunset Oriental, Sunset Chinese). They had been listed as used but in very good condition, and I honestly couldn't tell that they had ever been used at all. I am very pleased and will check this vendor for other books later."
2,Not feeling this one,"I've read ""Good Hair"" by Benilde Little and enjoyed it so I had high hopes for this one. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other reviewers did so I'll keep my comments short. Ayesha was a spoiled brat who seemed to get whatever she wanted. Things worked out a little too perfectly for her and it seem that she had everyone at her beck and call. And how she treated poor Will! She came off as being self - serving and cold. And the fact that Miles would risk throwing away a life long partnership just to get with Ayesha was silly. Hope the next book is better!"
3,Enjoyable Distraction,"I must admit, Benilde let me down just a little with this book. I absolutely loved her first two books, and enjoyed her last book, but - and I can't quite put my finger on it - something just wasn't connecting for me with this one. Maybe it was the shock of my beloved Miles actually falling for, and committing to someone, or maybe it was Aisha, who I didn't really care for through much of the book (she was a little TOO much for me). The book did its job, which was to keep me distracted during my son's first weekend away at college, but it didn't draw me in the way her books usually do.If you haven't read anything else by Benilde Little, don't make this your first selection (try Good Hair instead). She is one of my faves, but this just wasn't one of my favorite books."
3,(3.5 stars) A Decent Novel from Benilde Little,"Aisha Branch McCovney is on the verge of having everything she ever wanted. She's a young assistant media buyer who is marrying a successful art director. This upcoming marriage sends Aisha's mother Camile and grandmother Geneva in a tailspin because not only is her fiancé rich but also white. Added to the confusion, Aisha suddenly falls in love with a much older man named Miles. She must make some heart-wrenching decisions that could affect not only herself but everyone around her as well.Who Does She Think She Is? not only delves into the lives of Aisha but also explores the relationships of her mother and grandmother as well. The novel was a little dry in some areas but it was still a good read. Benilde Little brings us a novel that shows that fairytales can come true, you just have to alter them a bit."
4,"Good Story, but Very Simple","I rated it 4 stars because it was an OK story that was interesting in parts. No silly or corny things happen, and it was narrated well (I got the audio book). I did enjoy the thoughtfulness of the very well-developed characters. There was a good moral or lesson to the story also.On the other hand, this story was very simple and boring in parts--like most peoples' lives. It also had long streatches that were uneventful, and there was not alot of drama."
3,Who does she think she is?,"This book was OK. She started off good and then I don't know what happen. It got kinda slow, but it was good."
2,Who Does She Think She Is,"I love Benilde Little books, but this one was a disappointment. Kind of like she had to make some quota with the book publishers and just gave them something she was working on. If you wanna do some good Benilde Little reading, read ""THE ITCH."""
3,"My Granny, My Momma and Me","I decided to take this Labor Day weekend and get caught up on some reading. This story has been written over and over and over and over again and frankly, I am tired of reading about generations of women and their drama. My next stop is to read The Interruption of Everything. I hope it doesn't disappoint me as this one did."
4,There is no doubt... she is a diva!,"This is a well-written story about three generations of women who will make you angry, laugh, cry and cheer! Each woman has her own STRONG voice.Aisha is the third-generation woman who follows her heart - when she's gotta have it, she's gonna get it. At first, she comes across as your typical brat. Eventually, she understand and love her as her story and family history unfold.In addition to the lessons she learns from her free-spirit mother, Camille, Aisha teaches her Mom a thing or two about living. Even Grandmother Geneva, who shares wisdom with Camille and Aisha, proves that it's never to late to teach an old dog new tricks. The primary lesson learned by all is unconditional love and acceptance.The story is a pageturner filled with drama, laughter and romance."
2,Not Good at All,"I read this book in about an hour because I did not like the way it was written. I just wanted to find out what was going to happen at the end. It jumps between three generations of women in a family, and their struggles with men. They are of very different values, although they are family. That was the only vaguely interesting part of the book. I found the story fairly implausible and did not make a very compelling argument as to why Aisha was with her white fiance in the first place. Then she meets this other black guys and falls in love at first sight. I usually find Little to be a decent AA author, but this left much to be desired. I was turned off after the first chapter. Her book ""Good Hair"", which also discussed class, was much better."
5,Great if used correctly,"I have used these label removers for a couple of years. At first I had a problem with them but discovered how to make them work. Place label remover over wine label and smooth out, then place HOT water in the wine bottle and let sit for one minute. I have an instant hot water dispenser which makes this easy. Empty the bottle and use a razor blade to get the edge of the label started. The rest of the label will pull off very easily. The HOT water loosens the glue adhering the label to the bottle."
5,Very satisfied,"I bought both the 3/4-inch collar and leash, my first Lupine products. So far, I am very satisfied with my purchase and impressed with the craftsmanship. Both the collar and leash look and feel well made, and I don't think the product photos on Amazon fully do them justice. Lupine's replacement guarantee is just the icing on the cake."
4,It's a Wild Thing You've Got to Understand,"I love this leash's durability and guarantee,for my pup is a tough chewer. The ""wild thing"" pattern is perfect for my blue merle Aussie. I had class mates in puppy training class recommend this type of leash, for Lupine backs their products for replacement even if chewed and since my puppy has already nearly chewed through another brand leash that I bought for him, I couldn't afford not to try this one. It's a little stiff at first but I like it's wow factor and the keep-ability that it offers me. Thanks Lupine for such a great product and thank you Amazon for making it available at an affordable price. I definitely recommend this leash!"
5,Lupine is the BEST,I love Lupine collars and leads because they are so well made and have cute patterns. I also love the warranty/guarantee that they will replace them no matter what happens if they break. The hand loops on the leads are the BEST.
3,Clasp is too small and unwieldy,"I bought this recently with good hopes it will be a nice fit with my new puppy (3 months). Anyway, I thought it did ok except when I would attach it to my puppy's collar. The clasp is too small, there's not a lot of heft in it and when I tried to clip it on my puppy's collar (and with my puppy squirming and turning his head every time), it would not clasp easily. So, even though the leash is good as far as standing up to the chewing, I have a problem with the clasp. It needs to be bigger and more substantial. I have since gotten another leash."
1,Not chew proof,"This was touted as being indestructible/chew proof. My 1 yr old golden retriever had it almost torn in half with one chomp within first 5 minutes of using it.I did like the paw prints design, but it's useless."
3,Looks great.,"My dog's first leash with made by Lupine and we love it. Got this one with a great pattern on the leash, but it's not as soft to hold."
2,Ripped Leash,"Cute Design, however the leash ripped in less than a week, i also bought the collar through Lupine and I was happy with that product. Maybe my dog is just too tough, who knows, but I hope Lupine will exchange/replace the leash.-dave"
5,Cowboys Jacket,The Dallas Cowboys jacket ordered was exactly as was pictured.It arrived in good time. The jacket was packaged well and wasin great shape when it was delivered. Excellent service. I wouldnot hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
2,A disappointment,"I have enjoyed Henry James novels in the past, but ""The Golden Bowl"" is just too difficult to follow to listen to on tape. Cazenove's reading is fine, but the plot is so intricate and so subtle that it's nearly impossible to follow unless given the utmost attention. The plot progresses by changes in the attitudes and reactions of the characters which are too nuanced to come through one man's voice effectively. The novel's beauty rests largely in the reader's ability to keep up with the emotions of the characters--an effort that I just wasn't able to make.This review is only meant to apply to the audiocassette version."
1,Top 100 English-language novel of century loser,"I am reading the top 100 English-language novels of the 20th century, as drawn up by the editorial board of the Modern Library. This book was rated at 32. Sorry to say, it is very hard to read. It is with great regret that I am putting it down after 180 of about 500 pages. I am not enjoying the story at all. It is pompous and ponderous. I have to read some paragraphs several times, and still cannot grasp the meaning. Don't waste your time."
3,A massive headache,Like all the rest of James' works The Golden Bowl gave me a massve headache. Amidst all the adjectives and adverbs James tells an interesting story where all the characters act 'splendidly' toward each other. In this case deceit and infedelity are at the core. Hemmingway could have written this in 100 pages or less. James just makes your head spin.
3,"More than I was up for, I think","The rating is for my own enjoyment of the book - not for its literary quality.Henry James is not my cup of tea. Tea being an appropriate metaphor, as Mr. James could no doubt write fifty pages about how a woman holds her cup of tea with her pinkie finger extended just so, therefore indicating to the rest of the group her inner turmoils, her family history, and what she fed the dog for dinner.He has a tremendous command of vocabulary, long, complex sentences, engaging characters but it is such a long, slow read for me I find myself having to go back to the beginning of sentences just to see what the heck was going on when he started them.This book took me all month to read, with some personal time off causing part of the delay, and reluctance to dive back in the rest. I am sure it is my own failing as a reader, but from a pure reading enjoyment viewpoint, this did not do it for me."
4,THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT.,"I AM STILL WORKING WITH THIS PRODUCT, SO FAR THIS IS VERY GOOD, i will not know the results of this untill november of 2013."
2,Not for the 3900 Series,I have a 3955 and this sylus pack is not for the 3900 series. The tops will not fit down in the IPAQ. They are the wrong shape. It's like fitting a square peg in a round hole.
2,not one of the best episodes,Not really a good episode This is a part 1 and 2: But the plot is good. maybe a 2 & 1/2.
5,Just Simply A Great Book,Once in a while you find a book that's just plain fun to read. This is such a book. Exciting and entertaining throughout. Every page made you wonder what the next page would hold. The fictional account of a similar event that was attempted during the Civil War. The plot was very involved and had one twist after another. You'll love this one if you're a Civil War buff or not.
1,Quit working after a few days,"Bought it as a cradle for the home. The Palm cradle, that came with the handheld, stays at work. The iConcepts cradle worked fine for a couple of days and than stopped being recognized by the computer (incidently, it's the same laptop I use at work). The charging mechanism still functions, but it no longer performs a HotSync. Upon investigation, it appears the USB/Serial cable running into the cradle has worked itself loose. The base of the cradle swivels. The cable appeared to be pressed against the base and the cradle. Every time the cradle swivled, excess force was placed on the cable where it entered the cradle, eventually loosening the connection.My advice, spend the extra [money] and buy the cradle made by Palm."
4,Scathingly brilliant independant film with the right touch,"Filthy rich snobs become overly involved in dangerous theatrical plays and games until they are unable to trust each other. Outrageously entertaining independant film from TROMA (dismissing their reputation) with a non-stop barrage of twists, jokes, and visual gags. Excellent surprise ending too."
5,A book that changed my outlook on life,Baxter's story is inspiring. He maintains hope and committment in the face of huge opposition from the State. I first read it 30 years ago and it really made an impact on my thinking and outlook on life.
2,"I had high hopes, but it just wasn't any good.","I was very excited when this showed up on Amazon, and counted down its release date. When I received my copy I put it in the DVD player immediately. I managed to sit through every cartoon on the disc, and how I was able to do that, I have no idea. The cartoons are horrible, and very few actually have to do with Halloween. Most are just spooky-themed episodes, and even then they aren't entertaining. The Richard Scary toon has a stupid story about a neighbor who looks like a witch, and is followed by another short about learning how to count. Yes, on a Halloween DVD. I was hoping Bump in the Night would save this, but even it was horrible and the audio messed up during most of the viewing. Ultimately, this DVD was a great idea that was poorly executed. With all of the Halloween cartoons over the years that have not been released on DVD, THESE are the ones they selected?? Even at the low price of $6, it isn't worth it."
1,Ugh!!,"Every year i try to buy my kids new Halloween and Christmas cartoons.. so i was excited when i saw this release by Cookie Jar.. 11 Halloween cartoons? wow.. First off these cartoons are SOOOO boring!! Really i can't pick a stand out.. maybe Archie's Halloween of Horror?? Really the bonus episode, Hey Vern, Its Ernest: It's Holidays!, is the best thing on here..except it really isnt a lot about Halloween more holidays in general.. If you are like me and like to add new Halloween or Christmas DVD's every year to your collection.. skip this one.. you will thank me!!"
4,Halloween DVD,this is for kids less than 5 years old. Cartoons are not scary and just give a nice Halloween feel
1,Is every dvd copy defective?,"The ""Bump in the Night"" episode has a different audio track. What the heck is up with that. The company that made the dvd should have checked that before they shipped them out don't ya think.DON""T BUY THIS!BUYER BEWARE!"
3,A broad range of specializations,"Pettijohn has done a good job of selecting texts that cover a broad range of topics within the field of Psychology, and which have had a substantial impact on the field. Watson, Skinner, Freud, Rogers and Maslow all make appearances, as well as a host of other esteemed academics who are perhaps a bit less well known.The topics themselves are extremely interesting, but since the selections were generally written for the academic community, the texts tend to be dry. For that reason, I wouldn'' recommend this to the layman; you have to be a student of psychology in order to appreciate most of these essays.For the serious student, the selections are a perfect way to get an overall feel for the field of Psychology, and to perhaps start to gravitate towards a particular area of specialization."
2,Fidic Conditions of Contract : A Commercial Manual,"Please kindly add some items to book introduction as listed below, I think it is more important for a customer to make decision for his choosing a new book:1)year of publishing 2)summary of the book or content list 3)price of the bookThank you very muchFrank CK Wang from Taipei,Taiwan"
3,Nothing in here I had not already thought of,"The book was ok, but did not contain any new ideas or suggestions. There are too many anecdotal stories and not enough content to be truly useful."
3,"Good text, uninspired photographs","The rating of 3 or OK is right for this book. The text is actually quite good, whereas the pictures are (for this topic especially) quite awful. The black and white photos are all overexposed in my 1964 edition and for the most part are uninspiring . . . depressing."
3,Very Good,This book gave me all the info I needed to know about the famous architect Josiah Conder. It tells you about his life and his works.I recommend it to anyone who's interesting in Architecture.
2,Too much filler,"I am just getting into the home recording game and was looking for some texts to get started. This book fell woefully short of my expectations. It reads like a report written by a student the night before the report is due. There are literally hundreds of ""Hot Links"" with half page screen shots of the associated site scattered throughout-every other page at least. I would say that easily a third of the material in this book is these links and screen shots, and they are injected between the sections of text in such a way that it seriously impairs the flow of the material. There are some great tidbits of information and insights, but the mass of ""Hot Link"" filler makes it hard to recommend buying this. Just do a web search for ""home recording"" to get the links for free and spend your money on a better text."
5,Dont get better than this,A very good book for breaking it down in recording music and building your own studio it just dont get better than this explains everything and you get free samples and some programs to boot to have you up and running and making music this is a very nice package here and information which i think is good its a must have for studio tech heads .
4,Some good stuff about digital music,"Good, because the info about digital music is good. For me, the CD that comes with the book is the best part. Tons of sound samples and free software."
3,"Thorough, but fluffy and smarmy","I am not a professional audio engineer or sound designer, but have years of amateur experience. I was looking for a book which would help bridge my analog and stand-alone DAW experience (on a Roland VS-1680) to desktop computer based audio production.PROS: This book will be good for those just starting out who have little or no prior experience and want information on everything from mics to preamps to effects to software. The information is well laid out and includes helpful graphics.CONS: This book uses smarmy ""hip"" lingo in the manner of an aging uncle and devotes perhaps a third of the space to product placements for specific items and brands. While it is helpful to get specific recommendations, it almost seems there was a pay-off in this case."
5,Very Valuable Book for Practitioners and Academics,"I just finished the book and am still digesting all of the details! I'm not from Washington, but as a former teacher--and currently administrator--I think that the book really tells us a lot about how organization is linked to performance. Additionally, the author gives us a lot to think about with regards to maintaining organizational legitimacy. I'm not an organizaiton theorist, but Simon made it all very understandable to me!"
5,Excellent book,"An exceptionally well-written book which I highly recommend. It covers the resistence on Musa Dagh(Ler) led by Gabriel Bagradian, a grandson of a rich Armenian. With out spoiling the ending I will say that regardless of the happy ending regarding the people of Musa Dagh, this story is part tradegy. The plot is beautifully written and in my opinion can be considered as a great literature classic."
2,A Novel of Armenian wiew point of the Armenian-Ottoman relat,"This is a mediocre novel.If you are an Armenian extract or an anti-Turkish prejudist,you might enjoy the dream world of an obscure German writer about the one sided baseless wiew of the tragic events of the WWI.Has very limited literature and historical value."
1,A HATE NOVEL,This book make you understand that it is not so difficult to believe how Armenians were used against Ottoman Turks by French and British spies to kill innocent Turks during the WW I and got punished for doing so. This ethno-centric garbage is one of the worst anti-Middle Eastern books I have ever read. Thank god I did not have to pay for it. If you got time and money to waste by all means purchase this book.
3,FILAGRO STERLING SILVER BRACELET,"nice sterling silver bracelet for a kid. the bracelet runs small and is vey light, will be returning my 2."
4,Rashomon movie == 'In a [Bamboo] grove',"Likely you came here because of the movie. The translation in this Penguin book is arguably the best, but you can find 'In a [Bamboo] Grove' on the web for free (in ePub/mobi/pdf) as it's out of copyright. Try feedbooks etc.The movie is called Rashomon and yes that is a short story by the same author, but the movie is mostly based on 'In a Grove'."
3,"book is good, but the binding fell apart","I am enjoying the book. However, the binding fell apart and most of the pages have fallen out. I have had to tape them back in to finish reading the book."
5,Junie B Jones is a Party Animal.,Book Review by Perla Alvarez Room B1Junkie b. Jones is a Party Animal.If you like funny Books you should Read This Book.Because it's funny. And you are going to laugh when Junie B. Jones chirps; and Junie B. Jones was so excited to go to Lucile's Sleep over because...Lucile has one BIG HUGE house; And because Lucile's Ritchie Nanas Golden Car. You wont stop laughing so trust me you should Read it.It's so funny so read it because its funny when Lucile and when they pretend they are in a ball and Junie b. Jones is the fake singerRemember its funny Read it.
1,Yol like this book,Book review by Lilibeth CarabarinJunie B Jones is funny and in one part it said she's mi nana ante yore nana. And in Junie B Jones Party animal they put clews and meek up and they Luke wander fuel...
2,Cute Except for the Poor Grammar,"I will not buy any more Junie B. Jones books. While the characters and situations are cute, the poor grammar is not acceptable. These two examples are common: ""Me and Grace runned pretty fast,"" and ""I thunk"". Young readers may get the wrong message. (After all, the book is in print! in the library! at school!) I realize Barbara Parks is trying to make Junie B. sound like a little kid, but she could do this in other ways without outright poor grammar. For example, she uses many childish colloqualisms, such as repeated adjectives or misnomers (""Cattle Act"" for Cadillac""). My child stops to correct Junie B.'s grammar. She finds it very disturbing to have her reading interrupted by this frequent problem, and so do I."
5,Junie B. Jones is a Party Animal,"My grandaughter and I read this together out loud and her grandpa and brother started listening and enjoyed it as much as we did. I am going to print out the rules for ""staying over"" to give to all my nieces and nephews and their parents...we laughed and laughed and read them over and over. It is a good enforcement for the ""grass is always greener"" and Olivia looks at this nanna in a new light. Lucille's nanna ended up scaring Olivia when she was so picky about everything in her house. We are ordering several more of the books and have called the library asking them to order them for their readers."
4,"Junie B. is great, on account of kids identify with her.","I have read, with my three oldest children, all of the Junie B. books. These were the first non-picture ""chapter books"" read by the kids and those books made a great transition from picture- to word-centric literature. The grammar is intentionally poor, and the languge is pure kindergarten. My children knew enough to appreciate the thought behind the words and haven't yet gone on to mangle the English language in word or on paper. Enjoy the books for what they are - fun stories for the family to share. My first-grader is now going through the books and I am having fun all over again. Lighten' up!"
2,Not A Fan,"This book is intended for a first-grade reader. The grammar is atrocious and it contains a lot of slang. My granddaughter asked for these chapter books and I have purchased 12 so far. On a recent visit, I decided to read one of the books to her and again was astonished at the content. I will be looking for a new more appropriate set of chapter books for a first grade reader and won't be buying Junie B Jones books anymore."
1,waste of money,My old fat cat had no interest in these so I put them in a catnip container for a few hours and then tried again. She began licking it and the stuffing came out immediately so it must have been torn from the factory...
4,Better than the rest,Not what I expected. They have a texture and noise that's hard to explain. My cat likes to carry things around in his mouth and this has become his favorite.
2,Not for every cat,"I think these pom poms are probably well made overall. But they will not work for our very playful 1-year-old cat. He likes to bite toys and can be kind of hard on them. These pom poms can be pulled apart with little effort. There isn't anything in the middle to hold all the material together. Unfortunately, we can't use them for our cat."
3,"It's cute and fun for the cat, but rips apart so easily.","I was expecting it to able to put up a bit of a fight when he comes to cats, but it does not hold well together at all. I only allow my cat to play with it when i'm home as i fear she will easily bite off some of it and ingest it or choke. They are VERY cute, i love the pink ones, but they just tear up too easy. Overall, i like it but in the future this toy should be made to be tougher."
2,Bengal Not Interested,"Though these are well-ish made, my Bengal is absolutely uninterested in them. They are very soft and light so he has no interest in ""chasing"" them around (or playing soccer, as I like to call it). The material also picks up all kinds of hair and dust off the floor and gets stuck on them. I'm almost grateful he doesn't play with them because every time I pick one up, it's covered in hair that I wouldn't want him to eat.He absolutely lovesKONG Cat Hugga Wubba, Cat Toy (Colors Vary)andCat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy.Guess this toy isn't for everyone."
1,other reviewers cats must not play rough,"After seeing these balls last only a few minutes with my cat before dissolving into several pulled out fluffballs. My kitty bunny-thumped one of these balls a few times and, with each thump, some fluff pulled out of the ball. Curiously, I picked up another ball from the pack and pulled gently on the fluff. It easily came out. Sad quality!"
3,"too big,","i thought these sunglasses were suppose to be like john lennons, yes they are circular like his, but they are three times the size. Not cool, worth $10 yes. But no more."
4,Imagine... yourself wearing these glasses.,"I used these for a sculpture I made of Lennon. They look great on him, but I have never worn them so I don't know how well they are made for daily use. They seem sturdy though."
1,Buyer beware - Kelp with Folic Acid,"I bought this product two times, from two different vendors on Amazon (Vitamin Shoppe and House of Nutrition), both times hoping to get the Kelp in the photo. Both times I received Kelp with Folic Acid. This is a different product from Solaray and different from what is displayed above.Also, the fine print on the bottle is not shown in the description, but should be. It states:""This product contains naturally occurring constituents, one or more of which is listed by the State of California as a carcinogen and reproductive toxicant."" While the listed website doesn't state what the toxicant is, it is likely that it is because kelp is often contaminated (growing near the coasts, where pollution is greatest). Mercury is a possible culprit."
2,Bad Dice,"Ok, so if you were thinking that the price was pretty low for 5 8-sided dice, well, you're right. You get what you pay for.If you look at these ""dice"" closely, you will find that they are not consistent. The sides differ in size, some have sharper edges, some are very rounded. Even the faces on some of the dice are so rounded they don't sit flat. In other words, these are clearly not ""fair"" dice. Actually, they look like someone hand-ground the dice, starting with a big hunk of plastic.So, for a conversation piece, they are fine, and at least you're not out much $$$. On the other hand, it would be so easy to use machine ground precision 8-sided dice, and maybe charge you $1.00 more for the set, I don't see why they don't.Don't be surprised when these arrive..."
3,"Great idea, very enjoyable",I play liars dice all the time and with the new. Numbers and suits added it really adds another dimension to the game.
2,Screen flickers...,"cradle is fine and securely holds my clie, but the screen flickers a lot while charging. also looks cheaply constructed with a few exposed wires."
1,Screen flickers,When you have your Clie in the cradle the back light on the Clie's display flickers at a 60 hz rate. I cannot believe that's good for the Clie and since I'm very fond of my little PDA I'm NOT going to use this cradle. If I can't get it returned I'm going to junk it and buy the Sony cradle. I'll rest easier.
2,NOT an reworked Aurora model kit,"Contrary to another review of this kit, this is NOT a rework of the old Aurora ""Prehistoric Scenes"" Flying Reptile kit. That mold is owned by Revell/Monogram. This kit was a completely new model developed by Polar Lights. They used the Aurora logo on it because, at the time, they had rights to the Aurora logo & were putting it on reissues & new models that were never originally produced by Aurora. That created a bit of confusion, as you can see.As far as the quality of the kit goes... it's a decent enough kit for kids to work with, but is not an accurate rendition of a Pteranodon."
3,"Adaquite stylus, not great","When the original stylus that came with my Palm m515 started to slip out of its storage slot, I decided I needed a replacement. I ordered several different brands to find the stylus that suited me best. The picture provided for this stylus is a bit misleading. It looks as if it has a metal shaft, much like the original stylus, but this stylus is 100% plastic. It does fit nicely into the storage slot, unlike the Belkin stylus, but you may not feel comfortable with the lightweight plastic design if you are used to the original stylus."
1,This Zombie Movie,"really bad, if you was a gongstar, maybe you was like it other than that it's a C-Movie Type"
2,Could have been a good movie,"Gangs of the Dead could have been a good movie given the prmise. The biggest problem I had watching this movie was with the heavy set guy with the wool cap. I guess he was supposed to be the BAD dude, the MEAN dude, the BOSS. Well, he was most of all the ANNOYING dude.They didn't really need the zombies here. They had him. Sometimes these scripts can be written with a little bit too much 'over acting.'"
5,Good Choice,"I needed this film for my dad's new camera and it works great! We haven't printed any photos with it yet, but I think that they will turn out fine. Fast shipping, in great condition, and good price for four films!"
3,Old and grainy,"This Film was poorly stored before arriving. Upon processing, it came out washed out, poor color and grainy. This was not my camera as I have had no problems with other films before or after. It probably sat on a hot shelf in a warehouse instead of in a cool place for too long. Perhaps it was just this certain batch? I don't know."
4,Far better than any comparable Kodak,"While the picture quality of the 400 speed doesn't quite compare to that of the 100 speeds, this film is simply awesome. The sometimes artificial colors (punchy reds and deep blues) really bring out the 'pop' in most scenes (especially grey days). In terms of an all around consumer film, this is simply the best and is what I use when I shoot with my P&S. What makes this film so spectacular is that even with the higher speed, you don't have to sacrifce picture quality and color saturation, making it possible to hand-hold even in dim or night situations. The colors are great and the picture quality is nearly indistinguishable from slower speed films. Simply put, the only film that I like more is Fuji Reala."
5,Great deal for quality and came super fast,"Saw the great deal for this quality set of film, scooped it up and found it quickly at my doorstep. Unfortunately I haven't been able to shoot with these rolls yet, but I'm sure they'll come out superb."
5,The best music dvd you'll ever buy!!,"An amazing 64 songs on this double-dvd concert from 311 day 2004. It showcases songs from across 311's career, from the early days ('Summer of Love' and 'Right Now') to the more recent stuff ('Creatures (for a while)'). The sound and picture quality is excellent. You can hear all the instruments clearly and they've done a nice job putting it all together. The camera work could be a little better, but it's still rockin overall. They've also included some behind the scenes footage, making it the ultimate concert experience for any 311 fan."
5,Incredible DVD- A must see for all 311 fans!,"Hi fellow fans! I just have to say this DVD is awesome. Is like when you are in your car or in your room and listening to your fav 311 songs except you get to watch it at the same time! Unbeliveable experience! I did not have a chance to go to 311 day so this was the next best thing! I became an even bigger fan after this becuase I never really was able to get into the Music or Grassroots albums but after seeing them live I realized how awesome these albums are, maybe better than the later ones!I love these guys becuase they share my way of thinking like they sing in Do You Right ""...bright mornings, and when I want so much I want nothing, just this life and no more..."" its just enough to be alive to see the sun shine, and hopefully doing something that you love! I have so much respect for these guys!Be positive and love your life! - and of course get this DVD!MAchV"
5,KICKS ASS!!!!!!,"There are no words that can describe how awesome this dvd is. Everything is top quality. The picture is amazing, sound is incredible, and most importantly, the songs on here just rock. Every band member is in top form for this 5 hour performance. Talk about getting your money's worth. They play songs from ALL their albums, and even b-sides, covers, and rarities. I think they sound alot funkier and crunchier live. I do not want to spoil this experience so I'll make it brief. A 2-disc concert dvd with 5 hours of music, and 2 hours of interviews/behind the scenes. Get this dvd, 311 is one of the greatest live bands out there (which is not common these days). If you want the 311 concert experience in your home, this is the dvd to get. trust me."
4,Awesome Band,"Great Concert ----- awesome live act.2 disappointing issues:1. Did not Play ""Plain"" - which I think is one of the best funk/rock songs EVER!2. The filming of the concert was not done my a musician...note the camera pans away every time one of the guys is coming to a high light part of the song...for example..they show Chad playing the beat of a song...but as soon as he does somthing interesting...like an awesome fill they pan away from him...and I also noticed this on several other sections...such as some of P-Nut's bass breakdowns....other than that....they def...got the 311 concert vibe captured in this FILM"
1,Extremely disappointed,"I pre-ordered this and couldn't wait to get it. I put it in and started it up. It sounded horrible. I spent 30 minutes trying to see if my home theater system was broken. I was completely let down to find out it wasn't 5.1 digital surround sound. I am a huge 311 fan, but this is just sad."
4,Books about liver transplants for school age children,"This is a very sweet book, beautiful illustrations, and told from Lizzy's perspective. I found this very warming as a parent, and although my child is a preschooler and could not understand the story as well, he seemed to appreciate the pictures. I felt this was a useful educational tool for him just gaining familarity with the idea of going to the hospital, having IVs, and oxygen lines, and being in a hospital bed prior to him having his liver transplant at age 3 1/2 yrs. This is very worthwhile for any child or parent facing a liver transplant."
2,"Great Artwork, but are you kidding me?","This book is undeniably well illustrated.However, As the three star poster indicated, this book is difficult to read and decipher. It is an adventure to try and page through this book and have an understanding of what you are looking at. The text is not the best and descriptions for the images are a painful to read.I am wholly disappointed with one of the best pieces of eye candy in my collection.Justifying 2 stars: I just cant reconcile how bad the text in this book is. The illustrations are a 5 star. The captions for the illustrations are 1 star, and the text is 2 stars."
3,Not that great..,"I guess this book is good, but the illustrations are kinda hard to make out in some examples. It's a good book but I was expecting nice clear illustrations of the uniforms and soldiers. Many of the illustrations are hard to make out etc...."
4,a shrewd outlook on human nature.,"I discovered this book by pure chance in a musty London bookshop and was enthraled as soon as I'd read the first line. The style is straightforward and has a latent violence that expresses perfectly our feelings as we reluctantly become the dwarf, understanding and feeling what he feels because we've been there as well."
1,So far bad luck.,Fitting's for pipes is not right. Not much luck from the company as ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS ARE NO LONGER IN SERVICE. Not happy after shelling out a grand. WILL GIVE THEM ONE MORE CHANCE TO REDEEM THEMSELVES.
5,Excellent,"Great book! Very informative. While reading, it reinforced what had been taught to me by my instructor. It was refreshing to know what has been passed down to me and to my students is the proper etiquette of traditional karate. Sad that so many of our Americanized karate-ka miss out on true traditions in the dojo."
3,"Accurate, long winded and not always relevant, but enjoyable reading","Another entry into Lowry's remarkable esoteric library. While the information is undoubtedly correct, its relevance, even to those who practice Japanese martial arts, does not always seem relevant to martial artists in general, and the author's bias in favor of Japanese ethics, often in direct contrast to real events and circumstances, does not always make his work the most objective on the subject. If you practice Japanese martial arts, then this book would be of value to you, but if you practice any other type of martial arts, then its value is considerably lessened."
2,Very Uncomfrotable Bra,"This bra was very disappointing. I was hoping that it would be comfortable but it wasn't. It is well-made, pretty and of good quality but that's about it.It did distort the way I looked."
2,Porduct review,Through my own fault I selected the wrong size so the fit isn't as perfect as the other one I bought which was the same brand and the perfect size.
2,Poor contrast,"Although I appreciate excellent sound and sharpness of the picture, I can't live with the poor color contrast on this screen. I fiddled with the adjustments, as advised by other reviewers, but to no avail. The dark colors look like amorphous blobs, and the contrasting areas have an unpleasant glow. There's no contrast control. I really wanted to love this TV, but it's going back to the store."
2,Picture Too Dark,"I purchased this TV cause it was cheaper then the Sony Wega and seemed to have just as many features. I had high hopes for it, but I ended up returning it just a few hours after I got home with it. The picture was just way too dark! Even when the Picture and Brightness settings are turned all the way up, the picture is dark. This makes darker colors look black, and makes it impossible to see any details in shadows. I messed with all the settings, nothing would make it brighter. If not for this problem, this TV could have ranked right up there with the Sony Wega. Too bad."
2,Not so hot...,"The first thing I missed was the lack of on-screen programming.Even though this is supposed to be a ""flat screen"" it was still 13 or so inches deep and weighed about 90 pounds. The sound wasn't that good either. Since it was also physically dropped by the shipper(DHL), the seller, (J & R Music) allowed me to exchange it. I ended up buying a Toshiba 27AF44 that I thought was better.Be careful who the seller wants to use for shipping whatever TV you decide to get!"
2,Good book - Lousy support,"The book was very informative. However after finishing it, I was stupified to discover that there is no online errata and/or script download site. (Or if there is one, it is sure hard to find). It seems that Wiley and ""RedHat Press"" are hopelessly behind the times. This is a serious flaw in an otherwise very useful book."
3,You must be a fan of L.L. Smith,"Essential for the collector. As with most of Smith's albums, they do not flow but touch on several nuances of his style which is a mix of electric jazz, rock, and disco flavors. A good introduction to Smith is the ""Watercolors"" album."
3,"Nice story, great illustrations!","Larry Dane Brimner has given children four amusing stories in one lively book, Max and Felix. Max and Felix are best friend frogs whose escapades include an ever-present camera that commemorates the history of their daily adventures. Their adventures include a bicycle, skateboard, building a porch, a scary story and a fishing trip. Yes, there's something for everyone.These free-spirit frog friends are adorable and will charm children wanting a grand romp through make believe. The illustrations are comical, colorful and interesting. I'd love to frame some of the illustrations, they are that good."
2,Not the best,"I purchased 2 of these for my grandsons for Easter. They are both 2 yrs old. The chainsaw is okay but not as realistic as others I have seen for less money. The gloves are falling apart already, after 2 days. They wont last very long at all. I would not purchase this again and would be leary of the other Bosch toys."
5,Fun & Educational,"I first found this book at my local library and it soon became a favorite ... not only of my daughter but my husband as well. My husband actually gave me the idea to buy the book for our daughter's birthday so we now have our very own copy. I definitely recommend this book to any parent who wants a fun & catchy book that teaches the days of the week. There is also a clever poem at the beginning of the book that describes how days become weeks, weeks into months and months into a year. Simply great."
3,"Better Than the ""Month by Month"" Book - review of ""Day by Day a Week Goes Round""","The rhyme in this book is not very good nor interesting...Finish your breakfastquick, quick, quick,Mama's heels goclick, click, click.andThursday, Thursday,scrub-a-dubWash and seep and wipe and rub.... which is too bad because it could have been a nice little book one could use to lead into a discussion of the days of the week.In this book, Monday is just a day to hurry off to school and work. Tuesday is shopping day. Wednesday's library... Thursday scrubbing... Friday play-group day (hard to figure out how that works since mom and dad both work--lol)... Saturday's for getting muddy... Sundays snuggles, funnies, and pancakes. [Apparently no church or synagogue during this family's week]Three Stars. [C-] Pictures are cheerful and attractive. Book seems sturdy. Poetry boring."
3,"Frustrating to Assemble, Fun to Play With","A bag of assembly parts was missing and it took three -- not the advertised two -- adults to put this contraption together. But once it was together, the kids -- and adults, too -- loved it. They can't get enough of shooting baskets."
3,Decent,We bought this for our 9 year old son who loves it. Only down fall is when it is elevated to the highest height it makes it very top heavy and the wind blows it down easily!
3,Not as good as LifetimeModel 1501 (old model number),"Order was received as described, shipped on time and received in good condition. I was replacing a Lifetime adjustable portable goal and backboard system, model #1510 that I had for 15 years. From the description I thought I was purchasing a comparable Lifetime portable basketball base, backboard, and goal system. I had no problem assembling the product but it is not as sturdy, equal or better to the package that I had. The goal seem to be tilted up at the front so I will verify that that is the case and probably call Lifetime customer service tomorrow."
1,Worst product ever,"Do not purchase this product, unless you are a masochist and would like to waste an entire afternoon in frustration! Instructions are not clear and parts are not labeled as to front-back or top-bottom. I've had to undo several steps because of this. The worst parts were: attaching the pole to the base: attaching the backboard and hoop to the braces at the top of the pole, and attaching the top braces to the backboard - the holes in the braces did not line up with the backboard holes well! I ended up not securing the backboard to the top of the braces. If this were a smaller, easier to repack item this would be going back to Amazon."
2,would not buy it again,"we filled base with water, base was leaking. one of the the parts behind the board was not aligned properly so we had to use a drill to make a new hole resulting in illfit. called lifetime customer service to send new base, they said they need pictures of the base leaking to prove it. then another associate said she did not need pictures and will send new base but never sent it. very poor customer service by lifetime."
4,my review,i thought this product was very good but i think it is way too expensive. people who would like to hav this product cant hav it coz it costs more money than they hav to spend. i think it would sell better if it costed less and if this website was advertised more as i only recently found out that it exists.bye!!
1,False Advertizing - Picture & Product differ!,"First off - I only gave it one star because I had to. I would rather have given it a zero.The item says that it is a travel charger for said PDA models. That it ""Includes US, UK, European & Australian Plugs"". The fact of the matter is - that is a bold faced lie. It has ONE plug (not plural like it states) and the one said plug will fit into an American US outlet only.I also tried contacting the maker, who's information is on the back of the package. After 32 plus minutes on hold with no operator or customer service person to answer - I gave up. I also tried sending an e-mail to their website and the e-mail was returned saying that the e-mail address did not exist."
2,"""Montana Rail Link"" book.","""Montana Rail Link"" is a collection of black and white photographs by the author, taken across much, but not most or all, of Montana Rail Link railroad. It is a pictorial - not a history - of Montana Rail Link after its first decade of existance, with some good information. There are some factual errors contained and the book is lacking depth in both text and photographic coverage of this 600-plus bridge line across connecting two divisions of BNSF railroad in Montana."
3,Engrossing.,"""Montana Rail Link"" is an engrossing history of the MRL, one of the most successful operating railroads in the United States. At the start of this handsome volume, Wesley Fox, who has photographed and closely studied western railroading for the past eighteen years, chronicles the ten-year history of MLR, which was born on Oct. 31, l987. From the opening picture of a panoramic southern view from the Sheridan Hotel in Billings, Montana (BN 091 just happens to be crossing 27th Ave) to the closing photo of a retired MLR caboose in soft shadows, Fox's pictures--all b&w--have an aura of heartfelt eagerness about them. Alas, not all the photographs are first-rate. But his pictures (Train 024 passing through a triple truss bridge over the Yellowstone River; Train 122 rolling beside the lovely Flathead River; and, of course, the cover shot of Train 251 crossing an unnamed bridge) are admirally-timed and angled. Western rail fans will definitely want to peruse this volume."
3,Still Waiting,Still waiting for this book to arrive... ordered a couple weeks ago... growing impatient and considering ordering another one from somewhere else so I have this by the time I need it for class.
2,It's acceptable.,"Has decent vocabulary lists but the lessons aren't well organized. This DOES NOT come with the work book nor do you have access to activities online without paying for ""iLrn"". Overall, the web learnings, workbook, AND textbook together should be sold for this price."
1,terrible spanish book,"This book is overpriced, had to buy the cd from the website to do the hw which was 60 dollars plus it is very frustrating to use. I dont recommend this book to anyone that has a choice."
1,Since when does CD-Rom equal Hardcover,"I am as well deeply disappointed that this item's description can have the term ""Hard Cover"" listed in it. I have registered for an Intermediate Spanish course, and now I am still left without a book for the course. It is rather difficult to follow along in class when your textbook is nothing more than a round disc."
5,Pulled its own weight,"When I realized that my son's pending move to Savannah to begin his sophmore year in college meant I needed to pull a tandem axle enclosed trailer, I needed to equip my Durango with a breaking system. After borrowing the controller, I had to order and install the wiring harness within 3 days. Thankfully, the seller came through. The Tekonsha wiring harness was clearly marked with easy to follow instructions. I spent 15 minutes installing it, most of that time trying to see where I plugged the darn thing under my dash as it was dark outside and raining. But it worked as billed."
1,Really a terrible idea for a book and badly written to boot.,"Whatever possessed the author to believe that colloquial modern-day language might lend itself to a conversational retelling of this old story? I found the novel to be boring and idiotic, not very well written, and difficult to finish."
1,would not recommend,I was taking another fish oil vitamin brand then i changed to vital choice and things went from good to bad
3,Puzzle Ring,Ring arrived in great condition. It's very beautiful and arrived when needed. The only problem was the ring sizes run smaller than what they should. I had ordered a size 9 but the actual size of the ring that arrived was a size 7 rather than a 9
2,"Great for two years, then unfixable color printing problems galore -- $$$$","This was a great all-round printer for two years -- fast black and white printing and lovely glossy photo printing -- just what I wanted. Then the color printing problems started. Tests showed yellow was not printing at all, and cyan was streaking badly -- even though the machine's own diagnostic utility said the cartridges were half full. I bought two new cartridges ($44 each) but when I installed them machine then then told me the magenta cartridge (which had not previously had any problems, and which was nearly completely full), needed to be replaced. It wouldn't even let me print a test page to see if the new blue and yellow cartridges had solved those problems!I can't decide if I should buy the magenta cartridge (probably bringing my total of wasted $$ over $130) or if I should just toss the machine and get a DeskJet 2545 for $45 to print photos."
5,Very Good,"I recently purchased this printer because as a grad student I have been printing lots of papers and images. This printer has worked flawlessly and is very fast on draft mode. The duplexing feature is convenient, but is very slow."
2,HP Business Inkjet 1200 Glitch,"HP Business Inkjet 1200DTN Color Printerproblem after a lightly used 12 months the head alignment program from ""settings"" is permanently turned on. This causes a test pattern to print out after each printing job. Technical support couldn't care less--wouldn't even pretend to show interest."
1,Print Heads,"I have had this printer for a couple of years, it started out of the gate as a great printer, but shortly before I went thru my first ream of paper, the print started to streak and smear. Did many head cleanings and nothing fixed the problem. I ordered brand new print heads (four of them) and I might remind you, the diagnostic program said the print heads were still in good condition. After putting in the new prints heads, the printer was working great again. Shortly after I used up my next Ream of paper, the printer started acting the same way again. The Print head design on this printer is just horrible. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this printer. The printer heads are suppose to be good for 10,0000 pages, not 200 pages."
3,good inkjet,I'm converting to laser printers. this is my last inkjet. It works better than Canons that I've had. The cartridges are far less expensive than Canon.
1,What's the Deal,"So I ordered this printer... Have you ever heard of getting a printer with NO POWER CABLE? If this was not included, it should have been mentioned.I expected to have to purchase Ink, Printheads and a Printer Cable... But No Power cable...""What's in the Box:1200d printer, automatic two-sided printing unit, power cord, AC power adapter, getting started guide, setup poster, regulatory leaflet, support flyer, software CD-ROM, HP 11 printheads (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow), HP 10 black ink cartridge (26.5 ml), HP 11 color cartridges (cyan, magenta, and yellow, 14 ml each); printer cable not included."""
1,Not Worth the Effort,"Setting this up was a disaster. Very poor documentation, it took twenty minutes to figure out even how to open the cartridges. Then all hell broke loose, it refused to recognize them, and HP's 24/7 phone support turns out to be only 12 hours a day for inkjet printers. After 5 hours of struggling, I went to bed, called the next morning, and finally ascertained the wrong cartridges shipped with the printer. On the plus side, both HP and Staples were more than willing to exchange it, but the Staples manager also told me a lot of people have trouble with these cartridges."
3,Not quite as described,"This is a totally different camera than the one described under specifications. The Auto10 comes with batteries (2-AA) and a 12 exposure roll of 400 speed Fuji film. It also comes with a soft case, strap and a $5 rebate from Fuji. There is no autofocus, it focuses from 1.5 METERS to infinity (not 1.5 FEET as stated in product specs), there is no self timer. The red-eye reduction flash works well,the large viewfinder is nice, and the owner's manual is concise, but many of the other features such as the lens cover, motor and frame numbers are chintzy, poorly designed. Had the published specs been accurate, I would have known to purchase a different model. The quality of the photos taken with this camera was just average."
3,"Should have been titled, ""In Search of Swampland of the Northeast""",This book only addresses the swamp land of the Northeast; none of the other swamp systems of the United States.
5,Tremendous reference guide!,"Alphabetical lists of every player who performed in major league baseball. Contains standard stats- hits, hr, avg, era, etc. plus harder to find GIDP, HBP, SF, SH, IBB as well as unique stats like park effects and runs created. Pitcher batting stats and comprehensive fielding stats are included. A must have for serious baseball statisticians, although much of the information can be found for free on the internet. Print is very small."
4,"new park factors, but no win shares","Just got the 2nd edition. I like that the park factor is now listed alongside the league averages, and that the park factor is half-weighted on that year and half on surrounding years. I like that the range factor is now based on estimated defensive innings instead of games. I was disappointed that there was no ""win shares"" calculation; re-examining the ad in the 2000 handbook, I see Win Shares is actually a separate book which hasn't come out yet, not a new stat in this book as the ad originally made me think."
2,Disappointing and incomplete.,"I was promised by STATS, Inc. over the phone that this book would have the stats that I so long deisired for. However, upon receiving this publication I found thousands of pages of misreprensative interpretations of performance, but not the actual on-field statistics that I was looking for. With the advent of computers, I thought that STATS could have been much more accurate and complete with baseball history, like Macmillan."
2,dog didn't like taste,"Our dog wouldn't drink the water with this item in it. We could not giveit long enough to him to see if it would help the brown spots on the grass. Also tried it in his food, but he shyed away from that as well."
2,Package contains only 3 lights,"Partially my bad, but no where does it say in the product description how many lights come in the package. The picture shows 9 lights. The package contains 3 lights, I was expecting more. Of the 3 lights, the green colored light is very dark, the light hardly shows thru the plastic (I bought 2 sets, both green ones are like this) and the picture shows this if you look hard. In my opinion, a bit over priced. Shipping was as offered."
4,Nut Driver,"Seems like a good nut driver. I got it for putting in RS-232 serial interfaces.. works great, the walls of the driver are thin enough to get between the nut and the shell of the interface connector."
3,My real rating is three and a half stars,"As a child of the Seventies I never prayed in school except before tests (thank you RR) so I never missed it. If I ever considered the school prayer ban in passing, it was to think of it as a result of the cultural upheaval of the Sixties. The gift of this book to me was to point out people make history by their actions. The school prayer ban didn't just occur, like an earthquake or tornado. Certain people brought it about, and the rest of the country just took it in the shorts as far as I can tell. I would have said the phenomenon of letting the courts make all our decisions for us because we're too distracted for self-governance began at the time of Roe v. Wade, but now I see it goes back at least ten years earlier.The book itself is not written that well. I didn't think the author was very reflective, and the writing style is wooden. I still recommend it as a fascinating book about America."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book fascinated me so much that I spent the day (Christmas) reading it from cover to cover. It left me feeling profoundly sad for atheists who do not know the love of Christ. Madalyn Murray was truly evil and much of what she did was despicable, and I was often on the edge of tears as I read of the horrible abuses her children endured. I so appreciate William Murray for writing this. He is courageous. Christian adults will find that this book will strengthen their faith. Please note that (in my opinion) this book is not for teens or children as there are many references to sexual immorality."
3,reflector dilemma,"This order came quickly...although, I did have a problem...when I pulled the collar out of the packaging the reflectors were already peeling off, so I had to remove them and use the collar with out the reflector...."
2,Not that great,"I had this on my dog for two weeks before I gave up on it and used another product.I did not even see the dogs ""flea population"" lessen.Would not use a flea collar again,not with items like Frontline available that work quickly and for a month."
2,"Nice end result -- but a ""smelly"" craft","My daughter and her friend (aged 9.5 years) both LOVED the end result of this product...beautiful, colourful bowls! But the actual making of it was a pain. First, you have to leave the oven on for WAY too long to complete this whole thing. Then, the plastic emits such a noxious fume that my entire kitchen smelled afterwards (had to later bake muffins just to get rid of the horrible smell!). I was then so nauseous that I had to lie down for a bit in front of an open window. The instructions were hard to understand and no way a child could understand them. Instructions said that beads had to be 2 to 3 cm thick in volume -- that's a lot of beads! Only enough to make 2 bowls!! Would not buy this again."
2,not like the picture,"First, you really have to lay the pieces on thick to keep from having the creations full of holes, second you have to keep the oven on a while since it has be cooked, cooled, then cooked again. Thrid, I have found it near impossible to shape these things anything like a bowl. It might be good just let kids make pictures with the beads and then melt them together to form a permenant picture. I wish we had done that instead. For it is pretty."
5,Power Lines,I have been an Anne McCaffrey fan for many years. It is interesting to come into closer contact with her with this book.
1,Not even close,"Had to give this one a minimal rating to balance out the other reviewer. If that individual thought this was a gripping and emotionally powerful book, they must be 12 years old, or extraordinarily poorly-read. The plot development is clunky, the morality is ham-fisted, and the characters are one-dimensional. This is NOT McCaffrey's best work. In fact, it's the worst McCaffrey I've ever read. Do not buy this series. If you must try it, borrow it from your local public library."
3,"Exciting, but...","I was glued to my chair by this book. I thought it moved well and I liked the military technology and jargon. However, I was turned off my Mr. Brown's thinly veiled dislike of the Clinton administration. Mr. Brown should keep his politics out of his books."
3,Let's Be Honest Here,"I like thrillers but this novel lacks a key element, namely a hero. The ruthless international terrorist villian has no strong adversary representing the forces of goodness and light. Maybe that's why the baddie gets away with so much mayhem. And there's way too much ""tower talk"" here - this will no doubt please the fighter pilot wannabes who find endless air-to-ground-to-air lingo an acceptable substitute for real suspense writing. I agree that the action is exciting but let's be honest, great literature this isn't."
4,Gripping !,"Dale Brown has done it again with another terrific novel of action and intrigue, STORMING HEAVEN. I read anything I can find about military aviation and recently finished the much talked about WWII novel, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, which features aircraft not quite as state of the art as those which soar through Dale Brown's books, but the effect is the same--great action and inspiring plots."
5,An amount of action unsurpassed by any Author!,"This book is literally PACKED with action. By the 30th page a psychotic terrorist is on his way to kill thousands of people, and after destroying an F-16, evading another, killing hundreds of people, he jumps out the back of his cargo craft. Then you face two more airport bombings before the end of the 1ST chapter!"
2,Did Hollywood write this Book?,"I like Dale Brown and his work but this book is not good. There are way too many holes in the book. The way the bad guys are able to escape the inept government at every turn is aggravating. Also, midway through the book, the main terrorist discovers that he is the sword of Satan from a tarot reading women. What is that whole section book about? Totally out of place in military thriller. The story is interesting, but the book didn't flow like most of Dale Brown's book and the many holes insult the reader's intelligence. Overall I give 2 stars because of the interesting story, but not one of Dale Brown's best works."
1,48 ports blank plate. for keystone jack,"Bad design, it is a numbered plate where a keystone jack opening is too big. The jacks stick out the front, instead of being flush. bad product. i hate it."
4,classic album except for the noise,"Another classic album by the band of misfits. On this one, transcendence think that the year is 1973 -- which makes nic a treasure to fans of early seventies rock and pop. This is the best that genre's rebirth has produced in the last coupla years; the most sophisticated. but it also has many touches of the mod here and there, espeically in the opener somebody kill the dj. the songwriting is brilliant. the instruments are so in your face you swear it was recorded in your garage, not guitarist fernando perdomo's. speaking of which the guitar playing is colorful and creative in a way that few other guitarists can match. will the band ever tour is question and can they play this music live? has anyone ever seen them live? nothing is cohesive is my non-stop favorite cd right now."
5,Ed Hale is the most romantic singer !!!,"Nothing is cohesive was recomended to me by the local used cd store in san fran becasue I also like dashboard and they shared the same producer. Favorite songs are softening, all this is beginning, caetano, and tomorrow. if your baby could is also good. very beautiful song about love lost... the lead singers voice is so sexy on this CD and so are the songs. This whole cd is great with the exception of the guitar feedback which i wuold prefer not to hear everytime i play it. (you can fast forward through those tracks) PS, the singing at the end of caetano is in italian not portuguese I think. If you like romantic singing and emo you will love this cd."
3,Very Retro with a Modern Edge,"If you like 70s rock this album is king. Its loaded with intense melodic songs. The band give no regard to what's ""in"" or current and make music they enjoy. A far departure from their earlier endeavors. You can hear the passion of each musician and can tell this record is truly a labour of love."
1,Turntable LP,I have not been able to play it because it is an LP. I must not have paid attention to the type. I thought it was going to be a CD
2,I wish I did not have to write this!,"I love Asterix, I love French and Belgian comics. I grew up reading Tintin and Asterix and Lucky Luke and Spirou and the rest. But this adventure is terrible! Sorry M. Uderzo, I wish it was not so. Everytime I re-read this, I feel like I have read a horror story. Everything is so dark, Codfix is yucky, he is the worst character created. Of course, the death of a genius like Goscinny probably made his old friend very bitter. I give it a two because of the state of the art drawings. I put this one behind all others though. Who said Belgium was bad?"
4,Asterix and the Great Divide,"The humorous depiction of the adventures of the inhabitants of one small village in Gaul, (modern day France) which defies roman occupation in 50 BC with the superhuman power of a magic potion. Its full of beautiful visuals and excellent pun, especially the play of words in conversation and names of characters. Its gentle satire pokes fun on modern life, art and politics with caricatures of Napoleon, Shakespeare, Zorro and even James Bond.In Asterix and the Great Divide, a village divided by a ditch as well as their chiefs' opinions, with one side going to the Romans and having a hard time as Romans take them as slaves. The chief of the other side sends his son to the little Gaulish village for help. Codefix, a mean and sly Gaul, advices Romans to attack the Gaulish village. He steals a cauldron of magic potion for them and the fun begins with its strange and unexpected effect on Romans!"
2,Somewhat dissapointing,"First published in French in 1980 as `Le Grand Fosse', this album was first published in English in 1981.Chief Cleverdix sends his son Histrionix to the village by the sea, to call on the aid of Chief Vitalstatistix, to settle a dispute with his rival , Chief Majestix..Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are as a result sent to the divided village.This was the first book written by Uderzo alone, and is not one of the best. Much of the humour is recycled from earlier Astérix books, and the attempts at political satire are weak, unlike the superb political satire of `Asterix and Caesar's Gift' for example. Uderzo would later prove that he could however, write, good Asterix comics, with such gems as `Asterix and the Black Gold' and `Asterix and The Magic Carpet'."
2,Scandalous disappointment: Not the real Asterix,"It all summed up when I realised that this is the first Asterix book written after Rene Goscinny's death. Though Goscinny was only the author, anybody who's read at least a handful of Asterix books can now recognise the role he played in creating Asterix. This book is void of the real Asterix: the main villain is some creepy fish guy; there is a pseudo-romantic sub-plot; Getafix makes some more magic potions that are really weird; the Romans turn into balls and then shrink to the size of insects. The plot has only a remnant of the real Asterix stories.Gone are the days when Asterix and Obelix can make you laugh - except Asterix and the Black Gold, which is really good despite that Uderzo made it himself (it is a tribute to Goscinny)."
2,"Not a great story, really","I really appreciate Uderzo's attempt to keep the Asterix adventures going, but he really is a much better artist than he is a story author. Every single Asterix book up until Gozcinny's death is an absolute work of genius and I would very much recommend for reading. They all have plot, realistic comedy, and personality. However, Uderzo's attempt to match Gozcinny's talent at story writing has proven to be an absolute flop.To date, none of the new Asterix books, including this one, has any real adventure, plot, nor personal comical dialog which defined Asterix and his personality. Now, the books tend to move toward comical 'ridiculous' all throughout and are no where near the comical 'realistic-ness' that once define the great stories of Asterix.I wish Uderzo would hire himself a genius author to help continue the adventure and just throw away the obvious flops that have marred the stories since Goscinny's death in 1977."
3,First Asterix by Uderzo alone is good but not great,"This album, who came out originally in 1980, was the first penned by Uderzo alone (his partner Goscinny, who did the scripts while Uderzo did the illustrations, has died in 1977). Clearly, the Goscinny-Uderzo albums are better than those done by Uderzo alone. Still, this is better than some of the other Uderzo albums. The story is about a village in Roman dominated Gaul divided into two camps. There is a Romeo and Juliet like situation with a young man from one of the camps falling for the girl of the opposite camp. Asterix and Obelix become involved to try to mediate the dispute and prevent the Romans from taking advantage of the situation. Good but not great Asterix."
3,"Oh, my goodness...","... Easy Living is the smoothest track to cross my ears' path in a long, long time. The soul dripping from Jon Lucien's guest vocals is beyond words. The rest of the CD is... OK. Buy it for Easy Living, and play it loud the next time you're entertaining :-)"
3,The Secret Rivals Series.. 3rd Installment,i have this and the fight sequence is not bad in comparisum to 1&2 the series stays true to the hard core fighthing and actors in 1&2 but if your into collecting id say buy it. but if you don't have 1&2 id say leave it right on the rack where all the corney one's was left.. (lol) however this is the english version though this cover of the dvd i'm talking bout.
3,"Accurate color reproduction, but not very sharp with detail","Firstly let me just say, that I'm slightly confused as to all the different 35mm Fuji 'quicksnap' cameras out there. The 2 that I used were like the one shown here, but a slightly different color. Anyway, on to the review:The Flash indicator took a while to light up, but we got it going after some persistance. The photos were ok, nothing great though. The results produced fairly natural looking colors, but many of the indoor/nightime shots were slightly blurry and grainy. Many photos appeared under-exposed, like the Flash wasn't bright enough. 3/5 stars."
3,Great Light! Terrible Switch!,"Nicely made fixture - metal base. Gives off a a great, retro/analog feel with warm toned lighting. If you like the fixture, save youself some time and rewire with a stouter radio shack switch and enough slack in the wiring to allow easy bulb replacement before installing it. I bought two for a homebuilt camping trailer project and neither one survived the contruction and testing process."
4,Revolution: The Call to Holy War,"A book that really makes you think about the world we live in from the eyes of a person living for God. Brown makes readers realize the number of things in this world that are taken so lightly (mastered by Satan)that eventually will contribute to our downfall. It gives detailed perspective on what being a Christian is about and moves one to question their comfortable existence. Even if you are not moved to do anything after you read this book, at least it will definitely plant a seed."
3,3 and 1/2 really...,most of this commentary's very poweful and well written. this books about the sinful times were in and what to do.
3,Not engough data,That maybe the best karaoke equipment but you failed to mention about the songs. Are the songs built-in or do we need to buy VCD or CD+G? Your information is not complete and not convincing.
4,"Scanner Good, Software So-So","I think this is an OK scanner. I would actually give it 4 stars.The scans are very good quality and it scans pretty quickly [even quicker using the WinXP Camera & Scanner Wizard].I personally find the software with it kind of difficult to use but that could be because I seldom use or need to scan. Maybe if I used it more often I'd like it better.It's really not a bad unit, all in all. I upgraded it from 3 to 4 stars."
1,Not impressed at all,"This is my second Visioneer scanner and although I liked the first one (replaced because the glass broke), this one has been a hassle. ALL of my pictures scan in with a red tint to them. I have been to their web site with no answers to help me and I refuse to call tech support since they charge $2.00 a minute. I've come across a similar complaint on the web with no solution. This is not a scanner I would recommend."
1,Circles become ovals,Scanning a perfect circle results in ovals. Not so much so that you'd notice. But it is another reason to avoid this (or any other) dirt-cheap scanner.
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE,Simply put - this is the worst scanner I have ever used. The printed/electronic output can not be read most of the time. Can't figure out whether there are software or hardware issues.BUYER BEWARE!
5,I Be Somebody,"The book ""I Be Somebody"" written by Hadley Irwin is about a 9 year old boy who has to deal with racial discrimination. His name is Rap. Rap lives with his Aunt Spicy. Times were hard where they lived, because of segregation and the depression. Then they heard about a place called Athabasca, Canada, in church. Things weren't bad there. So then they decided to move there to get away from it all.This book was really good because I learned more about what blacks had to go through during the time of segregation. This book was also really good because it was understandable and was written from a kid point of view. This book is good for boys and girls 13 years old and younger. I really liked this book. I gave it 5 stars out of 5."
3,I be somebody 1 and a half thumbs up,The book i be somebody is about a young boy named rap who one day overhears people talking about a place called athabasca they say that when they get there they wont have to deal with somebody named jim crow he also encounters alot of racism but doesnt know it he meets alot of very intresting people too overall this book was pretty good i like it because it teaches kids that racial hatred is evil. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars
4,My cat loves this product,"My cat loves this product and I love my cat. Follow the instructions and you will have a bunch of fresh wheat grass for your kitty in a few days. Although it is packaged for birds, cats love wheat grass also. My only wish is that the container would have been a little heavier so that my cat would have less easily knocked it off the window ledge. But that is really minor."
2,"Pretty green grass, but my birds won't eat","I have two parrots - an African grey and a Mexican redhead. Neither would eat this grass. However, the grass grew according to the directions. Maybe my birds are just too picky!"
5,One of Aznavour's Best,"All songs on this CD are really beautiful. My favorites are ""Un Corps"", Un vie d'Amour"" and ""Ca Passe.""On this CD, Charles Aznavour sings songs about his life and times in Paris. Aznavour puts such feeling into every song he sings and you can believe that he is singing from his heart.Only Aznavour can sing this beautifully. He is a truly gifted entertainer.Many of these songs are not available on his other CDs and it is worth the price."
1,"Run, Run, Run Away, Really Fast","This is one of Lin & Larry's worst production and worst product. The video has nothing to do with offshore sailing. It is a glorified tour of Taleisin. For us modern day cruisers, this video provides virtually no benefits. Don't waste your money on this video, go buy a book instead."
4,Belva Plain does it again. Does not disappoint.,"From the moment I started reading page one, I knew this book would be one that I couldn't put down. The fact that I had so much to do and was able to finish it in three days, is typical of Belva Plain's writing. I have read everyone of her books, as they come out and only hope she keeps them coming. I was a little bewildered as to where the the duplicity was to be, but when you get to the last few chapters, everything comes together. What an awful time for these people."
1,inacurate,"I was dissapointed with the akward style of writing of this book. Also found some glaring errors. Vic. there were no car radios in 1938 (unless in Mercedes, perhaps.) German gentiles could not emigrate, specially men of army age.Most gentiles married to Jews tried to hide them underground during the war, with varying success. But immigration for them was impossible after 1936."
3,Where's the family conflict?,"I was disappointed! I do not want to spoil the book for future readers, but the plot does not ring true. All I can say is that the depth of the sibling rivalry is not revealed until the siblings are both dead. If there was that great a trauma, surely the reader should have had some inkling of it in the first 375 or so pages!"
4,A Good Read,This was the first of her books that I have read. The story was intriguing and real. The courage of her heroine was remarkable. Definitely recommended
1,Shallow & Insipid,"What a disappointment. The characters are shallow, the prose too flowery and unbelievable, and the story factually inaccurate. For example, after Eve returns to college after her first semester, she thinks that it had been a wonderful Christmas. Her parents weren't Christians, they were Jews who lost their parents in the Holocaust. Moreover, the author glossed over such important events like the death of Joel's and Caroline's parents that it didn't really seem to matter to the story."
5,Speed of Light,"Slow moving at first, and then I kept picking it up! It was so intense that at times it prompted nightmares. In the end it was well worth it."
5,"Sadness, truth, liberation","When I start a new book, I need a good portion of quiet time to bite into it. Like not wanting to gobble a gourmet meal on the run.This past Saturday I not only bit into The Speed of Light, I devoured it cover to cover in one day. It is not only a gourmet feast but dessert and french pressed coffee to boot!!This book touched me in many ways. In sadness, in truth, in liberation.If you have a beating heart, you will no doubt be touched as I was.Thank you.Heather St. Clair"
2,Couldn't get into this book,"The plot for this novel sounds interesting enough, but for some reason I had a hard time getting into this book. The story seemed to drag & I lost interest."
3,interesting characters,"I liked the characters in this book. The book centered on three people, Julian Perel, a brilliant man whose childhood has made him turn into himself. He rarely leaves his bedroom and watches television all day. Paula Perel, who is an opera singer who leaves home in search of a career. Sola, thier cleaning lady who is a refugee, running from memories. It is worth reading this book, but the plot left me a little stalled in the water. As the book progresses, the chracters progress, but the plot really doesn't go anywhere. It is worth reading however, and I would be interested in reading other books by the writer"
1,Too Precious and Self-conscious,I read this novel wanting to discover what others said they saw. But all I saw was the author's desperate cry for attention. I couldn't get past that. I do see how fellow customer reviewers could cry through this book but that's not necessarily a good thing. But how could someone be moved? Or find the words magic? I don't get it. The work is flat and meaningless to me. I only hope you see more in it than I.
5,Great Orchestral Jazz/Funk Soundtrack,"This is one of the best 1970s soundtracks I've ever heard. Makes me think Grusin could do pretty much anything. Really well arranged, composed, and performed. The recording quality is also excellent. Lots of cool 1970s touches like Fender Rhodes, funky backbeats, and a big string section. Listenable, but also varied and interesting enough for repeated listenings, making it better than many soundtracks from this era. I actually enjoy this CD more than the classic ""Shaft"" soundtrack that essentially started this genre a few years earlier. I only wish I could find more records like this one."
3,Thought it would work for me,"Tried it on my 03 Silverado 2500HD and it wouldn't break the pitman arm loose for me, a wrench doesn't give you enough leverage and there's not a whole lot of room to swing a wrench in there anyway. I ended up taking the steering box out so I could get a regular puller and an impact on it. It only took me 1/2 hour to get the box out which I wasted on trying to use this tool. Your mileage may vary. Good idea, just didn't work out for me."
4,Required reading,"This is required reading for the Catholic, literally as many catechism classes require it. It is also very useful for those wanting to learn more about their faith or the Catholic faith in general. It is full of useful information laid out in an informative and well written manner. It is easy to find information and questions. That being said it is also very dry, but its hard to make a book like this a page turner."
5,Great Book,This book I used for my RCIA and It was really helpful in explaining all the questions that I had. It is really straight forward and well written. I still reference it as need when I have questions. It was recommened to me by a priest.
3,Not my favorite way to learn about the Catholic Faith,"I don't think this has the best explanations...I loved it until it came to the lessons on preparing for death, which is a touchy subject to begin with but I didn't quite agree with the author's focus on making sure that we are spiritually purified when we face death. It felt rather unforgiving, whereas I prefer the lesson that when we die, we are given the opportunity to believe or not believe in God, and there is time to repent. Trese's writings made me start to feel anxious about dying which really should not be the case. What I'm saying is that it treats the Faith seriously, but maybe a tad too seriously when discussing death. A good book will teach us to want to be good and practicing Catholic Christians, full of love, hope and charity in all moments of our waking lives which will be magnified when we pass on, not to make us worry about death."
5,Good choice!,"I love period movies and this one did not disappoint. As some of the other reviews stated, I did not see the original movie or read the novel, so can give this a good rating as the first time I have ever seen or heard of this film."
3,"Not bad, but didn't care for it.","I wasn't very familiar with this story and purchased based on reviews. It's well done, but I didn't really get why the Rufus Sewel character was so enamored with the Emily Woof character (at least initally). If you are looking for an easy period romance this wouldn't be the story for you. Those familiar with the story may find it more appealing."
2,The Worst Thomas Hardy Adaptation I Have Seen,"One must wonder why they took the title, character names, and a handful of plot functions from Thomas Hardy's book at all. The heroine is reduced to background furniture; the snobby rich girl becomes a sympathetic female lead! They added in a romance that wasn't in the book and the ending was completely changed. Nothing really memorable in the way of acting, setting, or music, though none of these were particularly bad. I didn't hate it, but I really didn't like it, either."
1,"Instead of screening this movie, go outside and watch the grass grow","If you're even vaguely entertaining the notion that this is a Rufus Sewell movie, think again. He plods around the beginning of the movie and dies at the end, and is otherwise less actively involved than a guest appearance by Batman.There are slowly paced movies that unravel characters and plots with grace, then there are turgidly paced movies with deliberately lingering shots that could put a hurricane to sleep. As I droned through this film, I wondered if there was anyone one earth who actually enjoyed it without confusing it with a dull night's sleep. One can't help sympathize with the female lead, hate the male lead (who really really really isn't Rufus Sewell) and wonder whether the plot was left on the cutting room floor. This may have been adapted from a very good book which I haven't read; having watched this thick pudding, I'd rather reread Harry Potter."
3,The Woodlanders,"This is a good film but I have seen the original version (region 2) and sadly this region 1 DVD is missing crucial scenes, leaving some glaring holes in the story, particularly concerning the excellent Polly Walker's character, Mrs. Charmond. Had I not read the novel and seen the original film, I would have missed some important elements.The cast is top rate, particularly Rufus Sewell and Emily Woof, in her first starring role."
5,Can't wait!,"I am so excited that this is finally coming out on DVD. This was shown in England, and is a wonderful rendition of Thomas Hardy's novel The Woodlanders, and perfectly cast. It is great to see some of his less popular, but excellent, novels being recognized and brought to the screen. Perfect for any fan of Hardy, 19th Century novels or anything about rural England."
3,yawn!,"Since I have not read the novel, I can judge this piece merely as a film. And this is one of the most boring ones I've seen, although I adore costume drama. (Well, the three stars go to Mr. Sewell only.)"
1,Woodlanders not worth the money,"I primarily got this video based on the actors, especially Rufus Sewell, and the review of the movie itself. After watching it, I have to say that the ending was really unsatisfying. I don't know if it was the ending written by Hardy or one created by the filmmakers, but it was a really anticlimatic. Don't pay $26 for this."
2,Average Pan music,"The music is no different than you find on dozens of other recordings, maybe a bit clearer. The quality of the recording is good but the actual music is average. I have free Midi's off the Internet that I like better than the music on this CD, it has no heart to it...no joy! If you want fun and great Pan music try Bakra Bata's CD ""Steel Drums and Percussion"" It's fun and is some of the best Pan music you will hear anywhere. At times when listening to music you just know the people love what they are doing and are having fun, I just don't get that feeling in Panyard Vibrations. It's also a bit odd that my CD has eight tracks on it when only seven are listed, the last track being a Christmas piece...Sleigh Ride, what's up with that?"
3,underwater camera review,"The quick snap camera was very good. My husband and I took it snorkeling and cave tubing. It was great for snorkeling because we went on a sunny day, but if the clouds passed over or we were in a shady spot under the water, it wasn't so great. About half of our pictures came out really nice. It was not so good on the cave tubing trip because we were in a cave and needed a flash. If you use it on a sunny day, you will love it. Otherwise, try to get one with a flash."
4,Great for Swimming and Snorkeling!,"We used this camera on a trip to Hawaii and it takes great snorkeling pictures. Some people had mentioned to me that this camera tends to leak, but I didn't find that to be the case. One caveat though - there isn't a flash (or at least there wasn't on the model we purchased) so the pictures taken with clouds over head tended to be a bit ""murky"" - the ones taken in bright sunlight turned out MUCH better. I eventually plan on buying a ""real"" underwater camera for SCUBA, etc., but if you are just planning on going on a snorkel trip or going swimming this is ideal - I don't think that you can take it deeper than about 10 - 15 feet (maybe that's when it starts to leak) so this product would not be ideal for any deep water sports."
3,not as good as i hoped,I read everyones review and bought six to take to Jamaica. The underwater photos were grainy and no color vibrancy like I had hoped. on land the pictures in the evening were gray and very grainy. I had a lot of pictures that were a complete waste. I don't know if kodak is better but I will try them next time.
3,decent all around temporary camera,"I used it snorkeling in Hawaii. Even on sunny days in crystal clear water they came out mostly gray/green and crude rather than sharp/detailed, so I stopped using it for fish, turtles, coral, etc. There were usually two or three photos in each batch of 27 that didn't turn out at all. I had three different developers, so that wasn't the problem.Longs and Walmart definitely did the best job of developing from these cameras. Longs sells the cameras for about $8 each, too.It did a fine job on easy pictures of people and many landscape shots that weren't taken when the light was too bright or too dim, like twilight, sunset, or indoor pictures. Under less than ideal lighting, they often came out very crude and grainy with no contrast.It's fine as a temporary cheap camera or for the kids, but you'll probably want a digital camera above water so you can verify and redo your valuable vacation pictures under all lighting conditions."
5,Amazing pictures underwater!,"On a snorkeling trip we used this camera both in and out of water, and the results were terrific. It produced some hysterical pictures of my husband and I underwater! The fish turned out well, as did the coral. We looked like dorks! It was fun and easy to use."
4,Better than the Alternatives,"I tried several cameras on a recent dive trip, including a Kodak and a Fuji disposable waterproof camera.Neither camera has a flash, which means that everything will come out in shades of blue under water unless you bring your own light.Neither camera leaked, which gave them an edge over more expensive ""professional"" cameras on this trip.Both the Kodak and Fuji look very similar with a sealed plastic case (with slight positive buoyancy) and thick rubberbands for securing to a wrist or clipping to a BCD.I have to give the edge to the Fuji in terms of both design and results. The Fuji was easier to wind and to snap shots with and the pictures came out sharper. The 800 film in the Kodak produced shots that were way too grainy.I'd give it 5 stars if they added a flash and a bigger viewfinder!"
3,"Worked well, but when you factor in cost of processing, might not be worth it","Bought these for our Hawaii trip, they worked fine, but after buying these, developing the film, etc, it probably would've been cheaper and more convenient to spend an extra $30 for a cheap waterproof digital camera. At least that way we could've taken more shots and figured out if some shots didn't come out. Now, I'm out all that money and if we go on vacation again, I'll plan to spend money on a waterproof digital camera, but I could have bought that last time and still had it."
4,Great underwater camera - but no flash,"This is a great camera, but be aware that it has no camera ands needs good light for the pictures to turn out well."
2,Waterproof but a camera?,"A waterproof camera? Yes, but not one worth taking more than 5 feet under water. If you want to use this for open water, you are better off taking a mental image than spending your money on this. If you want to use this in a swimming pool that has crystal clear water on a sunny day, don't go below 5 feet and you'll OK."
1,Horrible Product!!,Bought this camera for underwater use on vacation. Based on the reviews I was excited that I had found a product for such a reasonable price that would capture underwater images.Just had the pictures developed and they are completely unintelligible. What a horrible product. I would rate this at less than one star if Amazon allowed since the photos are basically useless. Even at close distance the camera produced blurry images with no discernible sea life. And most photos were only a picture of complete blue (the water).Don't waste your money!! Sooo disappointed.
3,Disappointing Picture Quality,"I've always been happy with Kodak's underwater disposable cameras. Now that they're winding down, I've heard their quality has suffered and decided to give Fuji a shot.This took pictures quickly, was easy to operate, and came with a little rubber wrist band. Very convenient.It's also very affordable, eliminating some of the anxiety of using a digital camera.Minus 2 stars for picture quality. Everything came out grainy w/ a blueish tint. Just not a nice way to preserve memories.I have a Kodak digital underwater camcorder which also takes pictures (albeit slowly). It has its own issues, but the picture quality is outrageously better, and I'll stick with it on future trips.Overall, this is quick and convenient. Picture quality is below average and developing photos is twice the cost of the camera. Look at waterproof digital cameras, if they're in your budget."
2,not impressed,My daughter took it to Australia this summer to capture the great barrier reef. It didn't come out well. Blurry and about 3/4 of the pics were black and unable to print. So I would not buy again. Disappointing!:(
4,good for disposable,Used these on a snorkel trip to Cayman Islands. They were easy to use while snorkeling. Pics were pretty good. It's all what you're used to. Of course no zoom so you have to get really close to take a clear pic.
4,Good pictures,This camera is a great product. Mine didn't leak and I was able to get some great pictures (They aren't perfect but in my opinion they're pretty cool)
4,does it job.~ easy to use.,"easy to use. the price is ok. the design is very nice, I feel good to holding it.it is really water proof and some detailed design make it easy to use and thoughtful.however some of pics are not very good, maybe it is too difficult to focus under the water.We do capture some best moment, for example more than 100 fishes around us, the echinus in the rock.~~ nice..~~"
1,Bad Camera!!!,"I purchased 2 of these cameras to use in a water park, not one picture came out! My friend had the same issue. I suggest only get these if you are in the carribian with the sun blasting otherwise you are wasting your money and will be dissipointed because your family vacation photos wont come out."
4,Cozumel Coral Reef,"As long as the sun was shining, the cameras took great pictures of the reef floor. The colors in the fish did not show up the same as they were to the nakedFujifilm Quick Snap Waterproof 35mm Fuji Disposable / Single Use Underwater Camera (5 Pack)eye, but they were good pictures. I just would have liked to see the vibrant colors that the fish really had. I took some pictures of people out of the water and the pictures turned out very well. There is good and bad as far as the cameras pictures are concerned, but overall I feel the good out weighs the bad."
4,Really Cool,"This camera definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of picture quality; I was pleasantly surprised. I think that the view finder makes you think you are closer to an object than you really are, though, so get up close and snap those fishes!"
1,Junk Junk Junk,"Used this camera for our recent trip and the camera is absolute crap. We took such great pictures with this camera only to see that not one of the photographs came out decently. I have used the Kodak underwater camera previously with great results. Lesson learned I suppose, stay away from this camera!!"
1,horrible,"I bought this camera for use at a waterpark. The very first time it was brought to a pool area, we noticed water in the clear plastic case. We attempted to take few pictures, but decided to not use it anymore and put it aside - just in case the first ones were able to be saved. We took the camera in to our store to have the photos developed and were contacted immediately saying that A) the box was wet and falling apart, B)the actual film was completely slimed and they were unable to save any pictures and C) there wasn't even a battery in the camera. In contacting Fuji, i've only gotten a runaround. They CLAIM they'll make an exception (just this once) and send me a refund, but i haven't seen anything as of yet. Now maybe this was just a 1-time problem, but i won't buy anything Fuji again. What's the saying"" ""Fool me once......."""
1,"almost useless, not good underwater","This camera is almost useless underwater. It is pointless unless you have perfect conditions. It was nice to take pictures while 'in the water' because we were not worried about dropping it, but underwater no pictures came out at all. Most picture were taken in middle of afternoon with plenty of light and clear water. Camera was only a few inches under the ocean water and you really can not tell what is in the pictures. Very blurry and dark. Skip this one for underwater."
3,OK for shallow dives. get something better for more than 6ft,"I've used a bunch of these on recent dives. If you're not lower than 4-6ft, then this camera is OK. Anything deeper than that though and you're better off getting a professional camera.Even in shallow waters, photos will come off grainy, color will be somewhat off, and overall quality is mediocre. Still, it will work which I suppose is better than not.After using a bunch of these on multiple dives, i ended up getting a HERO3 camera. While the HERO3 is obviously more expensive, the image quality is superb and was well worth the price. Still, for quick , shallow dives this camera will do the job."
3,Pictures all blue!,"i have used underwater cameras before...and my pictures have never turned out like these ones. when i got them back from being developed they all had a very ""blue"" tint to them. it was so bad that you could hardly tell where any of the ""colorful"" fish were compared to the sea rocks because it was all the same color. even when i took pics that were above the water...same blue tint. i asked the film place where i got them developed and they said it was the film...not them. could be just an excuse but i dont know. wasnt too impressed and was disappointed that the pic of me kissing the sting ray came out so bad : ( maybe go with a different brand?"
1,A waterproof camera that's not waterproof!,"We purchased a pair of these cameras for a recent cruise to the Caribbean. After taking a bunch of fun water pictures in the ocean and cruise pools we couldn't wait to see how they turned out at home. Unfortunately, water leaked into both cameras and got all over the film. The photos were basically useless! I'd recommend finding another waterproof camera, the case on these didnt not hold the water out."
2,Simply Blue!,I used the camera both on dry land and underwater.. the pictures were all very blue in color tone.. I read the reviews and some buyers said on the dryland it was fine... Not in my case.. but it does help to create memories of being underwater.. better than nothing.
2,Needs flash,Wish I had held out for a camera with a flash. Used it for scuba at 25 feet in very clear water. I was not at all happy with the results.
2,very poor quality prints!,"I bought this camera for a trip to Hawaii. I went snorkeling in the clearest water I have ever been in; it was gorgeous and I saw so many beautiful fish. I tried to photograph them with this camera, and the pictures were horrible. They were all gray and non-descript. I was very, very disappointed. I would like to say it my developer, but I have taken many pictures to them and they are wonderful. I do not recommend this camera, even for novelty. It is a waste of money."
1,"Produces foggy, grainy pictures","Sadly, I have to say don't bother buying this camera. I just returned from Florida, and the ""above water"" pictures I took are very grainy and foggy. The ""underwater"" pictures were so black that Walgreens didn't even bother printing them for me. What a waste of money. Bummer."
2,Check the packaging is completely closed,"Ordered two of these for our honeymoon. Took them snorkeling only to find out that one of them the case wasn't properly closed and water entered the camera. This ruined the film and half of our pictures. We didn't check that the case was closed before entering the water, or if it opened because of being in our luggage, but either way, check the case well before use."
4,Scuba delight,"First rule of under water photography is distance. No greater than 8 feet of water between you and the object. According to physics; light travels slower under water than in air, therefore the amount of light the camera can capture with its limited disposable camera lens is smaller than in air.I purchased this camera at a dive shop with the understanding of limited distance. The pictures came out fantastically! Of the 27 exposures 1 picture did not come out; octopus rarely stay still for pictures."
5,great camera,Brought a disposable camera in my carry on on a recent trip to cozumel. Worst fears were confirmed when all the pictures came back black because of the xray machine at the airport. Had time to then pick up this camera and fire off all the photos in one dive and get them back to a one hour photo place before flying again. The photos came out better than expected. I took the camera all the way to 80ft where it didnt work because of the pressure but at least it didnt leak! It then worked again after coming back up to about 35ft. Highly recommend not purchasing the camera until you get to where your going if you have to fly!
5,Figi underwater camera,The figi underwater camera out ranks many others due to the fact after going through the beefed up security scans when developed it has bright color and clarity. others turn dark.
3,Good pictures,It took good pictures. I wished that it were digital because it is getting more difficult to get the photos developed now. Our CVS store just got rid of their photo lab.
3,it was ok,"it was ok, it took fair good pictures when the weather is good with sunshine. Underwater pic were not that colorful, it was all blue and green color. but the camera itself could work fine. I bought 4 of those, the corner was easily chopped. I chopped one corner and water got into the camera, but it still let me developed half of the film. all in all, it is not excellent, but ok to use. if you are expecting high quality picture, you need to walk away. if you just want to take some pics for memories, it is ok."
3,"So, so.","Not good, not great, not to bad. Don't use it if is a cloudy day cause your pictures will not come out."
1,NOT WATERPROOF,I purchased this camera for use on a dolphin swim we took in the Bahamas and was horrified to see that the plastic casing became filled with water and the lens was all fogged up - I threw the camera in the garbage - what a let down and what a waste of money :(
3,Skip this and splurge on a waterproof digital camera!,"This camera certainly served it's purpose, but in hindsight I wish I had bought a waterproof digital camera from the start. We took 3 of these disposable cameras on our honeymoon while snorkeling and participating in other water-activities. They turned our quite grainy (imagine the pictures you took with a disposable camera in the 90's)and overall very dark unless we were in bright, direct sun. We had no idea waterproof digital camera even existed before seeing others with them on our trip, and have since purchased one. The price for the digital waterproof camera was actually less than the cost of three disposables plus the cost of developing them."
2,Not intended for extended underwater use,"I'm sure this product would work fine for potentially wet activities (like canoeing or boating), but it is not built to stay submerged in water. I took this camera to Hawaii and went snorkeling a few times with this camera in my pocket. I did not dive below 15 feet, but somehow water was seeping into the camera.I took it apart and tried to dry it out, but the film was ruined and no where would develop it. Be careful how you use it."
3,don't expect perfection,"The Fuji underwater camera was good, but it seems that cameras for underwater shots are not perfect. (This one was much better than the unacceptable Kodak). I am appreciative of having even average photos of my first snorkeling experience. Be prepared to have many of the 27 shots out-of-focus or poor contrast and color."
2,Not so Great,"I used this camera in Hawaii. Any pictures taken underwater with this camera should be extremely close range, no more than a couple feet away, and the water has to be very clear and extremely well lit. The pictures will be a bit grainy and fuzzy. Which is to be expected to a certain degree. The best purpose for this camera is taking pictures in the water, but not necessarily under the water except under ideal conditions. I wasn't too happy with this one, might be worth the extra cash to get one with flash on it, becaues at the end of the day when only a few pictures turn out, it's not really worth it."
1,Bad Film,I purchased this camera to take to the Grand Cayman Island. I took the camera to have it developed and was told that the film was BAD. Not one picture turned out.
1,Terrible pictures,"I purchased two of these cameras on a vacation in Hawaii. EVERY photo has a horrible blue haze, including both on land and underwater. The best photos are barely in focus, and everyone has a washed out dark aqua tint. Don't waste your money."
5,Worked well,"I purchased two of these camera's to take to the carribean on vacation. I had read reviews and some of them were not very good. But I figured they are cheap and if the pics didnt turn out good it would not be a big deal. We used them while snorkeling and on the beach. I got the pictures developed as soon as we got home (the instructions say to develop pics as soon as poss.) and they turned out better than expected. The quality does not compare to a digital camera but who cares, it takes pics underwater for a great price. We got a lot of cool uderwater shots. It has a rubberband attached to it that makes it easy to not lose while swimming. Would definatly recommend this camera."
1,Do not buy,Pictures were grainy. very disappointed that NONE of the pictures turned out. All we have is memories of what was a wonderful day swimming with our baby. (and we cant share with out of town grandparents) We have taken pictures with other cameras and the lighting etc was fine....this was just the camera that was awful
1,worthless with no refund from amazon,"My family and I went to Maui and the Big Island, and I purchased these underwater cameras for snorkelling. We had done so for last year's snorkelling trip to Maui with moderate success. This year's purchase of these cameras was a different story. Upon our return, I took them to our local durgstore for processing. When I went to pick them up, the clerk said that I may want to look at them because I dont have to pay for any prints I dont want. They were awful. Dark, blurry if you could see anything at all. I should have looked at the expiration date before I used them, because these cameras were obviously defective or expired.I asked for a refund via Amaszon's refund process, and never heard anything. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE CAMERAS. BUY A HIGHLY RATED DIGITAL UNDERWATER CAMERA INSTEAD."
2,2 out of 4 leaked so far,I used two of them in a pool. Never went under water more then two feet and not one pic came out. You are better of getting a water proof bag for your camera then buying these.
2,Horrible pictures,I bought these for all of my family members to use for snorkeling and it was a waste of money. The camera worked fine but not a single picture was worth printing.
2,"Fuzzy pictures, colors not true","The pictures are grainy and fuzzy. Colors are not so natural. However for a cheap one-use camera, it is ok. Try to avoid any sun tanning lotion on the camera lense; otherwise, it will fog. Also, camera needs plenty of light in the water, so it is best used underwater in full sunshine. It works like a toy camera with big knobs."
1,Lost all my pictures,"This camera is NOT waterproof, water got inside and I lost all the pictures of my vacation at the beach!!!"
4,quick and easy to use,"I think this product was well worth the money that I spent. The one I really wanted was a couple hundred and right now I just needed something easy to use for a single snorkeling trip. The photos that came out were good quality in most cases and tho some came out foggy I went to the surface cleaned it off and no problems. I have to say for a single trip, and your are looking for an easy, point and shoot under water camera this is the one to choose I would recommend it."
1,There's a reason why its only 8 bucks,"It doesn't work in the open. I took all the 27 pictures but was surprised to find out there were only a few pictures on the film. All the pics taken in the open were either lost or too dark to see anything. Under water, it did just ok; kodak does a better job. Do yourself a favor and buy a kodak disposable. If you still want to buy this one, get 2 of these and try out one at home before your big vacation."
2,Fuji Quick Snap 35mm underwater camera,"I purchased this camera for my very first snorkeling trip to the Bahamas, and I was very disappointed. It was an overcast day, and the pictures turned out with a greenish/bluish tint. There was very little color from the fish or coral. Also, the camera just stopped advancing after 15 shots although it said it had 27 shots available. After getting out of the water, it still wouldn't advance, and I was very worried that the few pictures I did take would not develop. However, they did develop, but the quality was poor. I purchased the camera from Best Deal Supply Items. It arrived on time before my trip. I realize the failure of the camera was not their fault, and a customer service rep called and offered a full refund. Thanks, Jo Ann"
2,Good unless it breaks,We took three of these to the west indies so my daughter could complete a science assignment. One worked well - one seemed to work - until I had them developed and discovered that the film had broken and no pictures were taken. I still have the third .. anyone want to take a chance?
2,"Cheap, doesn't capture colors",I bought this for a recent snorkeling trip. The camera itself was leak-proof and performed well under water. The photos were quite disappointing though. It did not even come close to doing justice to what we actually saw. Not a very good buy
4,Fast Delivery!,I ordered this Fujifilm waterproof 2 days ago because my family and I will be going on vacation in two weeks. I couldn't ! believe how fast they shipped this thing! There will be a lot of water activities so I can't wait to use this. I will be writing another review ones I see how the pictures come out.
1,Not waterproof disaster deserves no stars.,"I gave this camera to my grandson on our trip to the Galapagos Islands. It leaked while snorkeling..It was not water proof. Most pictures were ruined. Very very disappointing, indeed.[[ASIN:B00004TWM6 Fujifilm Quick Snap Waterproof 35mm Single Use CameraThe two images that appeared were very very poor quality. What a disappointment!"
4,Fujifilm Quick Snap Waterproof 35mm Single Use Camera,"It served its purpose. It was a bit difficult to ""click"" to take the picture, but that was because it was encased in plastic so that it would be waterproof. The pictures during the day came out great...but once it began getting darker, they were grainy. It was 800 speed film, so I thought that those pictures would be better."
2,Fujifilm underwater film camera,"I tried in my sunny garden to baseline the quality and it did not come out good. Comparable to CVS pharmacy disposable 35mm. It went downhill from there: The underwater pictures were not worth it. Out of all the pictures, there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper. But, it's 6 bucks. So, c'mon, experiment with it. If you don't like it after that, you're out 15 - 20 bucks after developing."
1,"Great look, terrible pictures","I excitedly bought 4 of these cameras to go snorkeling in Belize. It looks very cool and I love the little lever to snap the photos. However, the proof is in the pictures. They came out horribly grainy, plain and simple. The few that were salvageable required a great deal of retouching. Many years ago I used Kodak's version of waterproof 35mm cameras and the picture quality was 10 times better. So that's what I plan to go back to next time and I highly recommend others do the same to avoid disappointment."
2,Don't try to use in an indoor pool,"My 5 year old son just learned how to swim and I wanted to document it with some underwater pictures, so we game him this underwater camera for Christmas. I thought that would be really fun for him. The film came back from the developer with no photos on it, so my son was really disappointed (and me, too). They said there probably wasn't enough light in the pool, even tho it's very well lit. So, we'll have to try again in an outdoor pool this summer."
3,Did what we needed it to,"My husband and I bought this for our first snorkelling trip, realizing the pictures wouldn't be the best quality. No, they're not, but we did get some good ones. I'd say about 10 out of the batch (which was worth it for us)."
2,Blurry pictures,"My husband and I took a trip to the Keys this year and went to Sombrero reef. It was absolutely gorgeous and the fish were so amazing and vibrant! We bought 2 of these cameras. When we got the pictures developed, they were all extremely cloudy and the camera didn't pick up the vibrant colors. We were very disappointed. I downloaded the pictures to my computer and was able to photoshop most of the pictures to make them less blurry, but still wasn't very good quality. We are going back to the Keys again next year, so we will be looking into a different type of camera and possibly spending more money so we can get back better pictures to show off to family and friends."
5,fun fun fun,"this camera was a blast to use on the cruise, at the beach and at the waterpark amongst the kiddos. highly recommend!"
3,"OK underwater shots, but are very grainy","Camera is a bit bigger than most disposables because of the plastic outercase. Avoid any lotion getting on the lens area because it will become foggy instantly. Pictures are grainy for sure, but ok if there is enough light on the underwater reef and fish. Colors are more bright than Kodak camera."
1,Pictures were ruined,"I was really excited to use this when I bought it, but I should've know better after all it was very cheap. I used this at a very brightly lit indoor pool and all pictures that I took underwater and outside of the pool came out looking like dark grey static. You could barely tell what the picture was supposed to be. I was very disappointed. :("
1,2 of the 4 were broken,"We got these for our Shark Dive in Hawaii on our honeymoon. We took 3 of the 4 with us! I took them to get developed - 2 of the 3 were broken! And the film was so badly damaged that no pictures could be developed. It's such a shame, as that part of our honeymoon is now lost :( I would buy them in a store (in packaging) even though it's more costly...but this way if something happens - you can get your money back :("
3,bought 2 but 1 of them only has half of the films working,"1 of the camera worked well with no skipping films, the view window is little small if you were to look through snorkeling mask. I haven't developed the film to see how the pictures turn out. the other camera skipped about half roll of the film... it is better than not having a camera to take underwater picture but I would not recommend it if you want good quality pictures."
1,very poor pictures,i bought 3 fuji waterproof cameras last year for a cruise.i took 2 cameras and used them outside on a tubing excursion and 4 pics half came out(they were still fuzzy)I thought it was the place i took the cameras to be developed since people didnt seem to be too knowledgable. so this year i went to a waterpark with my son and took last camera(went to a different place to develop them) and none of the pictures came out. so now i have no pics of two vacations-to make matters worse i have contacted fuji several times via e mail and i havent even recieved a response-so i will never buy another fuji product-i want pics of my vacation next time
3,intrigue and action in the Orient,"""The Falcon Killers"" was first published in 1939, during the height of the pulp fiction era. The story centers around an ace fighter pilot nicknamed ""Tzun Kai,"" but he is an American named Bill Gaylord who was raised in Peking. Embittered and hardened to life, Gaylord has made a sport of shooting down enemy Japanese war planes. The reason for his rancor begins when his parents are killed in the Boxer uprising and continues later when his foster parents lose their lives in war stricken China. His latest mission is a quest for a Japanese spy who could spell disaster for China. He sports a tattoo- an image of a half-dragon that holds secrets that even he cannot imagine. This is a typical action-packed Hubbard adventure with romance, intense aerial battles, intrigue, and narrow escapes that promise a newbie to pulps a very entertaining and escapist ride."
3,The Falcon Killer by L Ron Hubbard (Audiobook Review),"As with the other L Ron Hubbard releases from Galaxy Audio, ""The Falcon Killer"" features a main narrator, Chris Emerson, and a full cast of voice talents for the characters, including R F Daley, Christina Huntington, Jim Meskimen, Mark Silverman, and Robert Wu. As usual, the narrators all did a great job, and the full cast production gives the story an added cinematic quality.Another great story from a great American writer. Like Hubbard's other works, ""The Falcon Killer"" is just good old-fashioned fun.Steven Brandt - Audiobook Heaven"
3,3 Boxes of Life,"Great concepts, just 30 years old, as are the sources pointed to in the book for more information. Concept of balancing education, work and leisure throughout life rather than overloading in each time periods is major point of book. Could see an update from interested writer to apply timeless principals to today's technology."
5,A profound book for life's sojourners,"I first came across this book at my job's library and I STILL use a lot of the ideas and thoughts in it. I am so happy that Amazon carries it because I despaired of ever having it in my personal library - it has great ideas that are applicable no matter where you are in life - a student, worker, homemaker or executive."
3,More of the same,"While any Yu-Gi-Oh! product is a treasure to the true collector, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It is simply more of the same. I thought perhaps it was a review or some behind the scenes extras, but it is simply episodes that deal with the ""past"" from Season 2, Battle City, on top of that there are only 3 episodes- Obelisk the Tormentor, Yugi vs. Rare Hunter 1, and Yugi vs. Rare Hunter 2. So if you already have those in another form, unless you simply want all you can get your hands on, don't bother, because there are no special features."
1,supremes,"never received it. they said it was a download,after I purchased it damn@@!. i only buy dvds not downloads. I feel I got cheated. should of gotten either a refund or the dvd in the mail."
3,"Cute, unassuming, and affordable","This is the kind of camera you may want to take with you instead of a disposable. Pros:It's light, small, a no-brainer inexpensive tool to catch snapshots, and, last but not least, has a wide angle lens with reasonable sharpness for a focus-free camera. Cons: Film loading must be carefully performed away from light to avoid marks on your shots (but that's true for most cameras), and, obviously, image sharpness cannot match an autofocus P&S. Overall, a cute little thing."
3,ok for the money,"fairly easy to use ,it is a pretty good cheap camera,takes good pictures, flash and shutter cover"
5,Great!,This a great DVD! I purchased this for my ninth grade English students to listen to while reading the play. They enjoyed the DVD and it helped them to understand the play better. A good buy!
2,"Acting is Fine, CD Quality is Disappointing","The acting is fine and very true to the script. However, the audio CD is unreliable. I oredered two copies of this CD and discovered that both copies had scenes (different scenes were flawed, not the same for each CD) that would not play. I tried both copies on different CD players, but had the same result."
2,I didn't really like it,"This play was okay, but it wasn't anywhere as good as Hamlet and Macbeth. Romeo and Juliet didn't seem that believeable to me and I thought the way they couldn't bear being apart after only knowing each other for 3 days just didn't seem realistic. I know people married after only knowing each other that long back then but I don't think they could really be in love. The end was pretty good though."
5,Great 80's Movie!,"Funny, I wish I was still in high! Who didn't have a house party when the parents were away, and have the biggest show down of the school year."
5,Hip Hop ready to start!,"House party 1,2 and 3 are the best parts to ever be a complete sucess after Kid'n'Play finally done all three movies of House party and had made so many soundtracks for the motion picture.I will always remember how Kid'n'Play made this a no.1 movie of the year so everyone can see how it was back in those days.However,House Party 4 tried the best they could do in order to bring new laughter into the sequel.Unfortunaly,it was considered to be known as a dismal failure."
4,"Robin Harris, father of the year?","The most interesting aspect of the energetic and funny HOUSE PARTY is the father-son relationship of Robin Harris and rapper ""Kid."" Watch it and you will see how, despite disobeying Dad's order to skip the party, Kid behaves responsibly when temptation would get the best of other teenagers. Unfortunately for Kid, before the youngster can tell his father about it, Dad first wants to ""discuss"" the fact that the boy went to the party!"
4,Great chemistry between the actors!,"The chemistry between the principal actors was great! They were all hilarious, especially Martin Lawrence, who gave a very believable performance as the bald-headed stepchild homeboy of two popular teens. The dancing was incredible (especially Tisha). The only down side were the foul-mouthed performances of the villians (Full Force). Also of note: A. J., who appeared in ""I got the hook-up"" had his first speaking part in this film as the Jheri-Juice dripping dancer who went up against the late and great Robin Harris. (I was an extra on this film and the principal actors were all cool people!)"
2,A white man who just ain't down.,"I remember watching this on TV on afternoon. I said to myself 'Damn, this is one long Martin episode!'"
3,Cute little people,Going to use these people for a roof top setting in a train set up. Very cute people that will add to our set up
5,God's Gift to Scanning People,"This is my third scanner, the first one I got in maybe 1995, then one again in maybe 1999.Finally scanning is not a chore, it is amazing how fast this thing is. With my older scanners it could take a couple minutes to scan and my computer would often get messed up. This thing scans in seconds, seconds!Just make sure you have a USB 2 port (if not you can get an expansion card for pretty cheap) and you're ready to go.This scanner is so cheap too, the older model ones (8920) that aren't USB 2.0 are actually more expensive if you buy from a brick and mortar retailer.The only thing I don't like about it is during setup they make you register electronically with the software maker, and that software maker will try to sign you up for some ""Free offers"" and it seems some scumware too. But just check no."
3,Good product- but had to purchase software seperately.,"I knew that this scanner was several years old, but for the price I had expected to have necessary software and a USB cord included, and hoped for an instruction manual. It did come with a 'universal' power supply, but not even a note to suggest which voltage was correct. As received it was in good condition, but useless. After quite a lot of time-- downloading and installing two different Visioneer repair programs, ordering a software CD from them, and several e-mails to & from the vendor, it works very well."
2,it works but---,arrived with dirty glass and the program is confusing and hard to work with----peragon pete
4,Good Referece,This is a good reference book. The best part is that it is not intended to be a text book. It gives you just what you may need and is well organized.
4,Barron's Economics,Barron's Economics provides a thorough overview of basic economic topics. It is easy to read and well organized.
4,good and cheep,this book was just what i needed it was in great condition it has some good hints in the book what made it easier to read
2,Not that Great!,I think this book isn't very good. It needs more examples and real life situations instead of Suzy buying apples. I am trying to use it for studying for the CLEP and I am going to buy another book since I think this one is terrible. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Fuzzy Memories,"First of all,this was a short lived CBS Sunday night series called ""Cades County"".I did not expect a real clear copy VHS and tracking had to be used to steady the picture.THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SELLER!!! I was happy just to find anything on this show!With Glenn Ford and a very old Edgar Buchanan, a desert area cop show that I enjoyed when it was on.Outstanding bad guy Bobby Darin thinks he is Billy the Kid in the first segment.A good purchase who remember this show fondly.One note,in some scenes it's seems as if Ford doesn't quite have the lines down pat and kind of wings it.Movie stars could do that on TV."
5,This is great!!,"We got this for our 2 year old son. He was jumping on the couch, our bed, his bed, so we thought this would be perfect for him and it was!!... I am so glad we got this, he absolutely loves it!! He will jump, then lay and rest on it, then jump again! The rubber grip for the handle was super hard to get on, but that was the only difficult thing about putting it together. It only took my husband about 10 minutes total to assemble it. Definitely worth every penny!!..."
2,Wish I'd bought a sturdier one.,"It's okay. I like how the legs fold in so you can slide it flat under the couch--however, within a month, my 2.5-yo (30 lb) had broken off three of the four legs. They still work if you put them on, but if he jumps too hard, the trampoline jumps itself right out of the legs. We have to keep it up against the couch. My son is more destructive than most kids his age, but still, he is 2.5 and managed to bend and snap off the metal coils that hold the legs in place.Not hugely impressed. It works okay, but it's hard to keep it in one piece. I'm disappointed that it isn't sturdy enough for my 2 year old and I really wish I'd have chosen a different one."
1,BROKE 2nd DAY!!,I would NOT reccomend this toy. The elastic broke the 2nd day we got it. The design is flawed. Elastic band instead of metal springs?! Of COURSE it will break! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2,Tough assembly,"Had a really tough time putting this together, on christmas eve no less ;-) Holes not lined up correctly, parts that were easily missing or lost. In comparison to other trampolines on the market - and the one we purchased subsequently - I would not recommend. Also do not like the bungee cord usage for the spring surface. Much prefer the per-installed springs of the other trampoline we bought. Overall, give this one a miss."
4,Good and a lot of fun.,"I bought this trampoline for my two years son and he likes it especially now in winter, is a lot of fun. Puting the trampoline togegther is at least two person job minimum. The cord is kind of tricky but with patience everyone is able to do it. The bad thing about it is that is not so stable when my son jumps on it it the whole trampoline moves so i guess i have to find a way to make it stronger. Even that i still think it was a good buy."
1,Not a good design,"Had this trampoline for a year, and had to replace the bungee cord 3 times, the first time Galt replaced at no charge, but every couple of months the cord would break again. At $20 a cord, I wasn't going to keep replacing it,especially for the price I paid for the trampoline. I put electrical tape on the screws and anywhere there was metal or a rough edge rubbing against the cord, unfortunately it has metal grommets and I believe that is the problem. I put it out for the trash this morning, and I'm buying one that has plastic grommets. Other than this problem, my kids loved it, unfortunately it sat broken most of the time because I got so tired of having to replace the bungee cord....AND my kids didn't use it constantly, so it's not a very good design in my opinion."
4,Fun for Kids,This is a great toy for kids. My kids and their friends all love it. It's a bit scary to see the taller kids jump on it however because it tends to want to tip over. No one has fully tipped and fallen yet because we are ALWAYS watching during jumping but potential buyers should beware of this.
4,Great fun for the kids,"My daughter loves it! It was a little bit hard to put together, but once we got it, she has been loving it! Thanks"
5,Winter indoor gym!,"Our kids got this from Santa and have been jumping on it sense. It's great for winter when you can't take them out. Very durable. They also do flips on the handle and love it. Great buy, highly reccomend. Great price!"
4,Trampoline,"We bought this for our 2 year old for Christmas and she loves it! It wasn't very difficult to put together, and it's very easy for her to use by herself with the handlebar."
2,Not durable,"We've had this trampoline for only a few months, the bungee has snapped so many times we had to call the company for a replacement bungee (which cost us 19 dollars). The first night with the replacement bungee, it snapped. My 5 yr old is 45 lbs, well below the weight limit for this trampoline. This product did not live up to it's description."
4,"Great toy, but does not ""fold""..","First of all I must say that we love this trampoline. It provides hours of fun for my two kids. It was a little tough to put together, but once done it's great!IT IS NOT A FOLDING TRAMPOLINE, as it is called. We have a very small house and this feature was a major influence in our decision. However, it does not fold. I was under the impression that I could easily fold it up and store it when we weren't using it.The Handle Bar actually just unscrews (remove the bolts) and it comes off. But, you still have the legs that are about 8 inches high off the ground and they do not fold. So, this item can not be stored so easily. Plus, you have to make sure you store the handle bar safely and without losing the bolt and nuts."
3,"Great toy, but issues with durability","I used to think Galt had great customer service...I called them once because a screw came loose and they sent a new one right away. Now, though, the bungee cord has broken (after the 12-month warranty) and they want TWENTY DOLLARS for a replacement. It's unfortunate they're trying to make a profit on replacement parts...what a customer turn-off! Besides, the bungee cord should have lasted. We use the trampoline only a few weeks out of the year, and our son weighs 50 pounds--nowhere near the 70+ pound maximum.My son loves the toy, and I used to suggest the Galt trampoline to our friends, but after this experience I'll suggest they try others. I hate getting ripped off for replacement parts when the company should have built a sturdier toy to begin with."
1,Do Not Buy - Will Fall Apart in Weeks,"I'm warning everyone out there about buying this product. I got it for my[...]son this past Christmas. He is on the autism spectrum and I thought it would be fun for him. He only weighs 40 lbs and is well below the maximum recommended weight for this product.Within a month, the bungee cord that holds the entire trampoline together had snapped, rendering it useless. [...]Two weeks ago, I broke down and paid $[...] for a replacement bungee cord. Today, that snapped as well. Four months after purchasing this product, and with less than two months of actual use, this trampoline is going in the garbage.My son is devastated, and I'm very disappointed in all the money I've wasted on this thing."
1,My Daughter had fun with it... Until it broke,"After reading many good reviews about this trampoline I decided it was the one that I wanted to buy my three year old daughter for Christmas. It was not too difficult for me to put together myself.My daughter got a good solid two months of jumping use out of it before the Nylon bungee rope snapped. I was able to pull the rope tighter and fix it, but it didnt last long until that snapped too.After searching online i saw comments about contacting the manufacture about getting a free replacement cord under the 1 year warranty; However that turned up a bust as the company in the united states that manufactured it went out of business. Anywhere else that I had found to BUY a replacement rope was out of stock.And just one more item of note, i had to tighten the screws often because they kept coming lose."
4,Galt Folding Trampoline,My grandson who was almost 3 when I purchased the trampoline loved to jump on it for a week or so but then his interest waned somewhat. He did learn to jump with 2 feet together though. It is not heavy enough in the back so lifts a little although it has never toppled over. It's good exercise and I would buy it again.
5,Love it!,This is one of my daughter's favorites! She has had it for 2 years and plays on it every day! Highly recommend this!
3,"Great at first, then...","We got this trampoline as a Christmas gift for our 4 year old daughter. The assembly was no problem except for the bungy. It is very difficult to tighten. It untied after the first 30 minutes of use. My bad.I then used a clamp to hold one end of the line taut while I tied the other through the clip. After both sides were secured in this manner, there was still way too much give. I ended up making a series of double overhand knots pulling the line tighter against the frame in order to give it reasonable bounce.After 2 weeks of use, the bungy frayed and snapped. My daughter is very upset as she loves to jump. I'm about to try and contact Galt to get a FREE replacement bungy. Otherwise, I'm sending this back."
3,Tenzin Loves It!,"We got this for our overly active 22 month old, and he loves it!! It was a pain to put together, and the directions sucked, the padding along the sides ripped after our son bounced off of his butt on them. Over all Our son Tenzin loves it, I wish it had more bounce though, but he doesn't seem to mind. It'd be nice if the handle could be folded for storage purposes, because I'm tired of walking around it and it is an eye sore if there isn't a kid bouncing on it. But over all I'd recommend it, as long as you have the room for it."
1,DANGER!!!,"Within five minutes of assembling this trampoline for our three-year-old daughter, she had hurled herself over the handlebar onto her head!She is very agile and strong, and had no trouble scaling the ""safety"" bar with her vigorous jumping. We tried adjusting the bar to a more upright angle, but the same thing happened! We are lucky she was not seriously injured, and have disassembled this toy.If you have a very active child, BEWARE! The tarp is much too bouncy, providing a dangerous launching pad for tots."
3,constant repairs needed,"our friend gave us this to use in our apartment for the children to have a way to burn energy indoors, which is BRILLIANT, and the only thing i like about this purchase. it's a great idea. however, after only a few jumping rounds, the screws are all loose on the base, the handlebar is noisy from needing to be tightened and the blue rubber leg covers are dry rotting, thus rubbing blue spots into my rug. lastly, as others have stated, the bungee cord snapped and my 55lb daughter landed straight onto the floor. thankfully, it wasn't a small child and there were no injuries! i would NOT recommend this brand. maybe there is a better one out there? the idea is so perfect for apartment living with small, energetic children :) this one just requires too much maintenance."
2,The not so folding trampoline,"You have to unscrew the handle to fold the trampoline, so the folding option isn't great. I don't feel comfortable leaving it out for my 2.5 year old because of safety. He also likes to jump without the handle, so I have to be right near him. I got it because my son's therapists suggested a trampoline. I wish I had saved my money. This seller won't let you return it if it's been opened. By the way, it took my husband 2 hours to put it together. The bungee cord has to be threaded and stretched. BIG pain!"
4,Little expensive for what it is...,"Seems to be a little pricey for what it is, but it seems to be a decently sturdy product. Not sure about the bungee cord yet...As stated by other reviewers, it took help from another person. Just to hold tension as I pulled more of the bungee from where it was already laced through. It wasn't a very difficult assembly. Just make sure that you look at the picture and ensure proper placement of the attachement for the handle. I put the frame together wrong and did not figure it out until I tried to place the cover on (then had to take it completely apart and repeat). The directions weren't clear about the frame assembly. Even with that misstep, it only took me about 45 minutes.The kid I bought it for absolutely LOVES it, though. We'll see how it holds up..."
1,"it's not sturdy at all, broke in 1 month","I had bought this for my son's OT sessions as he couldn't jump of from bare floor. First of all the the parts they sent had misaligned wholes, and the screws on the handle bar couldn't be assembled properly. The base was assembled properly. After 2-3 weeks when my son learned to jump on it holding the bar, it couldn't with stand the jumps and base bars broke after a week.It's not worth the money. Pl don't buy this product."
2,Fun but a pain,"Purchased this for my 3 year old who loved it. However, you constantly have to tighten the screws. And one of the sections that connects the two bars on the side snapped to where it is not fixable. So great toy just a pain. Now I have to get a new one. Not this one just new trampoline."
4,Performed as advertised,"Our 4 year old wanted an indoor trampoline and this was the best one we could find for the purpose.It's sturdy and seems to be a quality product.If you don't want to have to reconstruct it, don't let your father-in-law try to build it first."
4,Joyful Jumping,My grandson (2 years 10 months) enjoys this very much! He was doing all kinds of jumps and exercizes on it.
2,Check your packaging!,"We purchased this for our son from Amazon and received a combination of the toddler and child version, which translates to the jump handle is designed for front attachment and the trampoline has side attachment pieces. It was going to be an early Christmas present for my son, imagine how thrilled he was after 1 hr of waiting for daddy to assemble only to find out we were shipped the wrong one. Galt should do better quality control. The trampoline itself seems ok, but the way the bungee cord attaches at the base will likely come undone frequently leading to your child falling on the floor. Would not recommend."
2,Save Your Money,"Based on the early reviews it sounded like this book had such potential. Unfortunately, that's all it had. There are so many ""issues"" with the heroine in this story that I don't know where to start. She's a woman who has a problem telling a man who ""looks like George Clooney"" that she loves him. She's concerned about being perceived as ""easy"" but once she goes to bed with him, she's only willing to have sex without attachment. I have enough emotional idiots around me. No need to spend money reading about them."
2,A Waste of Money and Time,"The heroine of this novel is terribly weak and therefore, unbelivable (as is the plot!). What man (black or white) would waste his time with the heroine? Personally, I would have dropped her after the first 25 pages!"
2,Not worth my hard earned money,"This book was..off hte top of my head annoying. Jenny was annoying. She was the typical black woman (in IR books) running away from a man she didnt htink she should be attracted to or want becuase he was white. Mick was the typical white man being abused by the typical black woman while trying to convince her that they belonged to her and he loved her and they could make it work. The s/l was VERY typical. Reading of a white man not wanting to jump headfirst in a realtionship with a black woman would have been more interesting and not to mention different. I dont know how Mick put up with her and towards the end, he didnt but he caved. Jenny was just senseless and all becuase he was white. Again, this book was just annoying but it wasnt horrid and if you really just want to read a book...it will do."
1,Complete waste of a tree,"This book was a waste of my time. I really wish that I could have the three hours it took to read this ""book"" back. First off, the typos threw me off, second, the main character Jenn was the most indecisive woman I have ever read about (and I hate indecisive people) Third, Mick's constant references to Jenn as his ""Brown Beauty"" and ""brown love"" really irked and insulted me. I am supportive of IR love but this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. If my man kept on referring to my skin tone, I would dump him in a minute. Better off skipping this book altogether. It's not worth the money spent."
4,Where You Find It,Book arrived in very good condition And in time span given by seller Thank You. B.Miller
1,Disappointing...,"One word...disappointing. I read the reviews and they were all so optimistic...""a great read""...""the best I/R story ever."" Don't waste your time or your money."
5,A mostly-forgotten but very important 1980s R&B figure.,"Because his five solo albums have been out-of-print for so many years Kashif has sadly become a mostly-forgotten figure of 1980s R&B. His importance and influence, however, are undeniable and ""Condition Of The Heart"" was (along with 1983's ""Kashif"" and 1984's majestic ""Send Me Your Love"") among his very best and finest works. On songs such as ""Dancing In The Dark (Heart To Heart)"", ""Stay The Night"" and the title track he gives Luther Vandross and Freddie Jackson a run for their money. Buy it while you still can!"
5,Great fun to read,"This cook book is full of those old nostalgic recipes you'll love to read. If you've lost an old bake sale recipe, it's probably in this book. Get it for you collection."
5,Arrest those who won't release Midnight Caller on DVD!!!,"It's criminal that this GREAT television show hasn't been released on DVD yet! Those who have the power to correct this gross miscarriage of justice should be rounded up like cattle, and forced to watch episode upon episode of shows like Dukes of Hazard, until the DVD's for Midnight Caller are available! Every episode was finely crafted to tell a story of human suffering and/or intrigue, with a gutwrenching monologue by Jack Killian at the end that actually made you think! I don't know about you other fans of this show, but I always had tears in my eyes at the conclusion! Release it already!"
4,nbc showing incompetence again,"this is just one more example of NBC being headed up by morons. this show was awesome. i was 12 when it was out, but has always been one of my favorite shows and i always check around to see if it is ever released. ive managed to find a few bootlegs of shows every now and again, but you think that NBC would get the hint being that every one of their current shows they have suck...and after the conan and jay issue, theyd listen to the fans. dennis dun is the man, its gary cole before he was known, and wendie...oh wendie... release it already"
5,How long Is It That We Have Got To Wait For This Wonderful Series To Be Put On DVD???????,"I live in the UK and when this series was first televised over here I used to stay up and watch it relidgiously ever time it was on. I just cannot understand why it is taking so long for it to be put onto DVD so 'us' people who loved the series can yet injoy it again. And also why is there other television series that do not come anywhere near the greatness of this programme are already showing on DVD. It is certainly up there with the likes of 'Dallas', 'Dynasty', 'Knotts Landing' 'Lost', etc, etc, etc,............some of the 'greats' of the past few years. SO, please put 'us' Midnight Caller fans out of our misery and release it soon on DVD."
1,What the Heck?,If you are thinking about buying this book to learn something about data recovery this book will not help you. Maybe this book was supposed to go with some on site instruction class.
4,"Technical, but applicable!!!","This book not only provides you with a great introductory to C programming, it provides you with vital information about operating system file system structure and surface level disk reading. I definitely recommend this book. There are some grammatical issues with the book, however, it in no way hinders your ability to disseminate the objective."
4,"Very good, gripping!","This was a very good book. From the first page until the last you were caught and held captive. I read this book in one day. Cooking dinner and reading at the same time is not easy, but I did it because I could not put the book down for a minute! I would highly recommend this book."
1,This was noted as NEW,"This is absolutely not a new book. It's clearly been read several times - even the pages are yellowed. Love the author and I hope this story is good, because I feel mislead. It specifically stated the condition as NEW."
3,An honest but inadequate effort,"Dr. Patterson's book is, as far as I'm aware, the only serious analysis of non-voting in America that makes any effort to address the usual (and false) idea that our high rate of non-participation is somehow harmful, divisive, detrimental to democracy, etc. He presents another point of view, but devotes less than 4 pages to it; in the rest of the book he shows the same bias as other writers. Still, credit where credit is due; the book would be worth reading for this fact alone."
1,A tiny and poor reproduction of the real lantern,"This is a scaled down version of the original Hurricane Lanterns, which makes it look like the real thing.Pitiful, simply pitiful. A true waste of good money.Alas, I can only be thankful that the person who bought this item for me, did not buy me SIX of them as I had 'wished' for.Don't waste your hard earned money on this."
3,brass appointments are nice,overall it works. it's a lamp you put oil or kerosene in and it lights/heats your space. bit smaller than the other offerings. brass appointments and whatnot. it's blue it's pretty it works.
1,Absolutely terrible,"These lamps are china made and not worth it at half the price. I purchased eight to use outdoors on my deck during the summer. Two leaked like a sieve as soon as they were filled and dripped flammable oil all over my deck. The metal is so poorly fit that there are cracks between the base and the arms that support the glass and top, and the oil just drips and drips. Of course once filled with a flammable substance (that has dripped all over the outside of the lamp), they can't be mailed back so I ended up throwing them away. I expect the that if the other six don't spring a leak before the end of the season I will be lucky. I will probably just throw the remainder away even if they last that long, and look for something of higher quality for next year (or maybe sooner). Certainly don't purchase these to use inside your home. I give them one star because you can't go any lower."
1,"Very, very cheap quality","As the title states, this product is extremely poorly put together. The metal is thin (in the parts that are metal), the container is a pain to fill (and it leaks), and the glass is thin (it broke within two uses). Mine is now in the trash can."
1,Never got to use it,"I ordered the lamp under the premise that it would function like the ones I used as a child while camping. Unfortunately, those days of quality are gone. The coating is of the lamp (not paint) is applied haphazardly and unevenly. I filled the lamp with oil per the instructions and it started to leak from where the base of the lamp meets the body and not in one spot, but along the entire seam. Save yourself the hassle and go with a name brands that has proven quality."
5,You Get What You Paid For,"I really love these little lamps. I bought four of them to set on our outdoor Thanksgiving Table last year and they were a hit! I also used them for St. Patrick's Day this year and we lit them to keep the bugs away. Just like with any lantern, be careful not to knock them over with oil inside whether or not they are lit. They did not do such a great job keeping the bugs away but they are really pretty lamps and I think ""looks"" is their main purpose for a price like this. A friend at the St. Patrick's Day celebration wanted to buy them from me. I bought the black ones and they have a matte paint finish and an odd way of opening the glass in order to light the lamp, but it's easy to figure out. They are about 10'' tall and I don't regret buying them because I plan on using them for more events in the future."
4,Great for the Bargain!,"The price is right, can't argue with that. Pillow cases are cozy too. Especially in those cold nights."
1,Its just two pillowcases!,"Dont be fooled people, it's just two pillowcases. I ordered it thinking i was going to get an entire bed set, but only received two pillowcases."
5,"Laundry Valve,","I purchased as a replacement for one that I install 17 years ago, the valve handle corroded over 17 years. The purchase and replacement both went quick and easy."
5,"Swift, stern, complete","David Lansdowne is the stern but understanding father of major gift solicitation. He pours light into shadowy corners, sets realistic expectations, punctures silly myths, and swiftly explains each step in the solicitation process, from preparation to asking to the thanks. He delivers full weight on the promise of his title and holds your hand throughout (though his touch is more of a sharp tug; clearly he's been through this a thousand times and heard every board member dodge and complaint). This is a super-fast read; ideal for busy board members. Lansdowne also makes clear that success is mostly a matter of diligence, common sense, and heeding expert advice -- and his advice is rock solid, industry tested. I rank this top shelf, up there with Kay Sprinkel Grace's Ultimate Board book and Jerry Panas' Asking."
4,worth buying,"This ""1-hour crash course"" is ideal to give to a board member with a short attention span. It's more detailed than a PowerPoint, but reading it really does take only an hour, more or less. Longer how-to books have more details, so if you're really into fundraising, and want tips on how to improve, this won't do. But it's a good introduction for a well-intentioned newebie, especially one who will be participating in a fundraising campaign, rather than running it. It's a combination of a pep talk and how-to pamphlet/"
3,Fundraising,Seems to be a bit redundant after a while and could have been made more succinct. But then it would have been a pamphlet rather than a very small book!
4,As described,I purchased the product because I wanted a thin cover for my notebook that was not too bulky. It is working out great! Product came quickly. Great buy for the money!
3,Organmania,"If you are into organ or if you want a peice of interesting history buy this album. One might find the vocals the downside of this project. Not on the top of the list of Canturbury albums but note worthy for it's historical value and having Dave Stewart on Keyboards. The most Progressive track being ""Symphony No. 2"", which clocks in at 22:40. Dave's use of the ""Tone Generator"" is spectacular. Note: there are only Drums, Bass, Organ, Tone Generator and Vocals on this album."
3,nice track from hotwheels,"This is a nice durable, large race track from hotwheels. It didnt take long to set up and the monster is amusing. One negative is that I purchased extra accelerators cars that cost $1.74 each and some of them dont work with this track. Thats a bit annoying. I purchased the accelerators for the extra money and only cars with certain widths fit this track. My son and husband played with it for about 20 minutes and havent touched it since. I just dont think its as fun as the car washes or garages that have several different imaginative play pieces. You put this car on the track and race it to beat the monster, thats simply it. I do think its a nice track and cute monster but my son is really more into using his imagination, I think this one was a waste of money for us"
3,Swamp Beast set fun but wobbly,"My two boys, ages 4 and 6, absolutely love the swamp beast set. My only complaint, is that the risers used to elevate portions of the race track are wobbly and don't stay upright a lot of the time. There is A LOT of assembly, although each piece is marked with a corresponding letter, which greatly aides the process. Overall I think this is a fun product."
3,Whaddaya mean it deoesn't come with cars??????,"Are you kidding me?I bought two of these. One for my nephews birthday and one for a kid in my daughter's class's birthday. My husband put it together for my nephew and said ""That thing was a real pain in the butt to put together...and to make matters worse there were no cars in the box!""I thought he was joking. Luckily my nephew HAD a few Hot Wheels in the house. I can only hope the other kid I got one for had a few Hot Wheels lying around in his house.So my main complaint is: For the money this costs they should have at least one or two cars that come with it.This toy is okay...but I have yet to see ""The Monster"" win. (Maybe I'm playing it wrong?) I'm 33 and I played with it ten minutes and got bored. The kids seem to love it though (ages 3-7) so what do I know?"
1,"Good Seller, but Bad Game on Mac","The game came quickly - kudos to Amazon and the seller. But after loading the game, it continually fails after starting. The game begins and runs through a lengthy intro. Any interruption of the intro results in being kicked out of the game. Allowing the intro to run to it's conclusion ends with being kicked out of the game. Very frustrating. I have owned Windows version for years without this kind of problem. I would rate it as zero stars if I could since it is useless."
3,A bit outdated,"Runs good on my computer but it's a bit outdated, not even close to being as exciting as some newer games like the ones from the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series."
3,A rare gem,"Belinda Bauer (Airwolf and Robocop II) and Anthony Perkins of Psycho fame star in this modern version of Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray story. Bauer is both beautiful and monstrous as a fashion model on the rise to superstardom. Through the years, everyone around her grows old and tired. Everyone except Dorian. Dorian is as gorgeous as ever. Gorgeous and haunted. Dorian never ages, but her screen test does. Her sins are adding up and it's getting ugly.The climax is a true creep out.Here's hoping it gets released on DVD soon."
4,I took a second look...,"I watched this moving while finishing my book and couldn't really catch the meaning behind it. I watch a second time with no distractions and I was very impressed by this movie. I have to say that I wasn't really a fan of the brother and sister doing the nasty, but overall, it was a good movie. I also agree with a previous viewer when they stated that that sibling incest could have been left out and the movie would have still remained a great movie."
2,sex with your own brother ewww,I really like this movie but the part with the brother and sister doing it is a little to much for me that part will aways be in my mind that just gos to show you that money cant make you happy and that you never know what goes on behind closed doors
1,Should've left this on the shelf at Wal-Mart,"What the hell was this??? It started off as being a good movie and then all of a sudden I see a brother and sister doin' the nasty AND THEY SHOWED IT!!!! They couldn't have just left it to our imagination no, I had to see it. I thought that could've been left out period. I was going to buy this movie from here but when I saw it at Wal-Mart, I went on and bought it. BIG MISTAKE!! I hate because I can't return it. Please stay away from this movie. Unless you like all that incest involved."
1,Horrible condition.,"While the service with wonderbookandvideo was exceptional, the actual video that was sent had most of its cover worn, torn and missing. The actual quality of the video was borderline un-watchable. The sound was muted and practically inaudible. I am disappointed because I wanted to watch this film and incorporate it into my collection however, I am now going to attempt to use a vhs cleaner and improve its condition. The product was sold as in ""Used - Good"" condition but it is obviously poor."
5,"""Ride with the law never against it""","I just recently picked up my first L'Amour title and it happened to be a tale of the Sackett's. since that time (about a week and a half ago) I have read through six of this families stories, the best as of yet has been ""the Daybreakers"" I found myself totaly entrenched in the story line and the passion of Tyrel. I definetly recomend this book to any one out there, and plan to continue my own quest through the Sackett legacy."
2,Big mistake,Louis L Moore is an excellent writer about the spanish. I know he spoke it but never knew he wrote it. My mistake was not previewing the book before I bought it. I can speak and understand some spanish or Tex/Mex but am unable to read it well enough to get anything from this book.
3,A good Louis L'Amour coup,"I don't give many L'Amour books more than three stars because I like to get more emotionally involved in my characters than he lets me. But this is definitely a good book. That comes from someone who grew up reading Louis L'Amour. I know people believe Louis never got his facts wrong, but as a western historian I've found a lot of mistakes in L'Amour's guns, and also in the historical characters he sometimes uses who were actually dead the year his books take place. I love L'Amour and the Day breakers!"
1,los madrugadores,"This product was unacceptable due to it being written in a foreign language (Spanish). Buyers should be told up front that it is not in English...if I was told, I missed it.I returned the item."
2,Unfinished and a bit disappointing,"Many of the stories in this book are interesting -- at first. Then they just end abruptly -- no payoff, no closure. There is something to be said for an open ending -- but when an entire collection of short stories end that way, it is frustrating for the reader. It also leads one to believe that the author was not pushing herself hard enough (This is not a swipe at the author, just a reader's observation). I finally became bored with the format and disappointed with the stories."
2,Can the characters have their own voices please,"Despite the fact that the narrators in these stories are poor, uneducated, rural children, they speak in syntactically complex sentences with preposterously broad, sophisticated vocabularies.Really, Ava -- the young girl abandoned alone in the swamp in the first story, who at 12 years old doesn't seem to have been to school in years -- uses phrases like ""her body doesn't ululate in dead languages.""? Expresses refined sentiments like ""infinity comes lapping over, concentric circles on still water""?Come on.In other words, they all speak in the voice of the highly educated MFA who created them, not in anything that could possibly be their own voices. That was a dealbreaker for me right off the bat. I'm surprised that this collection is as well reviewed as it is."
5,imaginative,Can't imagine any author with a more fertile imagination! I could almost feel her brain churning out these stories! A very fun read.
2,"well-written, but unsettling","I tried really hard to like this book. It is very well-written, but parts of it just make me uncomfortable. I also felt that the stories ended in inappropriate places, and none of them really tied-up at the end. I read the first 4 stories, then I stopped."
2,Disappointed,My book group read this book for our last meeting. Those who showed up to discuss the book were unanimously disappointed. The majority opinion is that the stories are dark and disturbing and leave you hanging with no ending much less a happy ending. We were impressed by Karen Russell's writing but left hanging and disturbed by her story content.
1,Complete and utter disappointment,"I just finished the book and am very disappointed. And in all honesty, this book was disappointing from the start.The stories were vaguely entertaining...but this is simply because they were so odd. Unfortunately, being able to invent weird places and situations doesn't take much.The tone and diction (ESPECIALLY the diction!) is a joke. The author attempts at writing from a child's point of view in many of the stories and fails miserably.The stories don't have endings. The author tries to leave the reader hanging but the stories just end abruptly I was never ""left hanging"" because I didn't care. I didn't care because the characters were so unconvincing and the stories didn't move me at all.All in all, this book was a complete waste of money. And, I regret financially supporting such an idiotic author. I know middle schoolers that can write more intelligently and convincingly than this fraud of an author."
2,huh?,"I found Karen Russell's St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves in a short story anthology and thought it was funny, as well as brillant in its originality of a philosophy...that of society trying to make us all the same cookie cutter, and in the process turning us into robotic, water downed versions of ourselves, devoid of character. That was it's real shine. I have attempted to read Swamplandia! and this book of short stories in hopes for more of that insight and originality; but I think now that Karen Russell hit on something unawares, and never could get it again; like knocking the ball out of the park, but not knowing how you did it. Her batting average is around 10%; I found her stories pretentious and devoid of any real meaning...the long titles...the fabricated places...the odd character names..etc...only work when there is something of substance behind it; other than that, it looks gimmicky. She has admittedly one brillant short story, that she seems to be building a career upon."
4,St. Lucy's Home for Girls Raised by Wolves: Stories,"Totally weird! My favorite is the title story, last in the book. I'm giving the book to one of my granddaughters for her 15th birthday, as her mom says she reads anything. For something different, I recommend this book."
5,I loved it!,"I loved this book! It is quirky and funny. It was so refreshing to read a book that had such an unusual style. That the stories are set in Florida made it all the more intriguing for me. If you are tired of the same old thing, this is just the book to get you out of the doldrums.Linda C. WrightAuthor of One Clown Short"
4,Beautiful but frustrating,"This book is so frustrating and unfortunately has done nothing to change my mind about disliking short stories. It's sad because every story is so gorgeous. The characters are wonderful, you care about them so much, and not one of the stories has an ending. So you are left hanging. If that doesn't bother you, then I can recommend these stories to you with all my heart. It seems like a concious choice, I don't think the writer is lazy at all. But for my taste I need closure."
3,Interesting beginnings with no resolution,"I bought this book because I'd heard good reviews about the author's debut novel, and because I like short stories with a punch. I have to say, though each story started out with promise, overlaying ""normal"" humanity with something from fantasy, there was no payoff in any of the stories. They are articulate, and artistic...and feel very unfinished. I felt almost as if the author took snippets of stories that had been started but she wasn't sure how to end them...so she just didn't end them. I'm all for leaving something to the imagination, but in this case, each story seemed to end right where it was beginning to climax, and left me feeling very unsatisfied."
2,Read the reviews,"I bought this book out of curiosity and because the reviews on amazon made it sound so good. I love her use of imagery and metaphors and agree with most readers on how lovely this book is, but I'm a little disappointed with the flow of the stories. Each story begins so elegantly, but always looses my attention during a change of thought or scenery. I find myself having to reread ever so often just to make sense of the paragraphs. I really want to like it, but feel that I'm starting to get A.D.D from reading it. I guess I just prefer books that flow and make reading easier. All in all this is a lovely book and should be enjoyed if you have the time and I would recommend buying a used copy."
3,"Quirky, fun","I bought this book after reading and loving Swamplandia! The stories are good, but paled in comparison to Swamplandia! and the vivid characters in it. She is a great writer and I enjoyed reading this because I could see the nascent ideas that eventually became Swamplandia! I look forward to her future works."
5,Back to the Beginning.,"Here is a worthwhile buy, to see how the ancient fathers of the Church interpreted the book of Hebrews. This is made for both those well read and for the regular lay person. It's set up for both reading as well as for use as a commentary. Highly recommended."
3,Okay movie,"This wasn't an excellent movie, but if your bored it's entertaining. I wouldn't give it an award or anything, but for entertainment value it was okay. I would have bought the DVD rather than the Blu-ray though. It would have been cheaper."
4,No new blood shed here ...,"This movie was entertaining, but George Romero's Survival of the Dead was way better.It was amazing how quickly people forgot the rules of survival.Uh ... let's go ride amusement rides while zombies are milling about?DEF NOT!How were you going to start & stop the rides?Yeah, suspend all reality.Did this movie make me exclaim ... Oh, that had to hurt!Yeah, it did.It reminded me of the old Batman TV series, only with blood."
3,Zombieland or Hollywood...huh?,"Greetings ""...of the Dead"" fans:Middle of the road...the beginning is strange, but you begin to like the characters except the virgin boy guy...leave him and go with the girls,he he he. However I think the whole idea of cross country driving to get to a Amusement Park is dumb...please! I love the surprise actor we meet...but it's LA! Come on, everyone is an actor or gas station attendant...I won't tell what happens...you judge if you accept it or not...I didn't care for it, but I accepted it. Told you the virgin boy was a pain in the zombie ass. The film has good points and a lot of ooops moments...it's better than you think after watching a few times, but Harrelson? I think Gary Busey would have been wonderful! That's why there are reviews!The film is not a winner, not even close, but for $5 and a sandwich (oris it?) stuck in your teeth, it's OK..."
4,zombie movies rock,"this is a fun movie if you are into zombie killing, recomended for all who like a good laugh and some gore."
4,Zombie-tastic,"This movie is good clean fun. And by clean I mean hilarious, full of gore, and dry humor.Zombieland = win."
3,Expected More,Great casts lead to great expectations. This movie was amusing but I think it could have been so much better. The whole segment in LA was silly and a terrible way to wrap up what was up to that point a pretty good movie.
2,Watch Shaun of the Dead instead,"I heard it said the makers of this movie were inspired by the success of SHAWN OF THE DEAD.Uhhmmmm ....... well......... they should have looked for more inspirationWhile SHAWN OF THE DEAD is excellent and sets the 5 Star Standard for a Zombie Spoof movie, this movie (Zombieland) shows glimpses of potential but falters and instead relies on too much simple stupidity to try and be funny.It fails to have the kind of creative wit and dark humor that made SHAWN OF THE DEAD so good.If you like people breaking things, cursing as much as possible and simply acting stupid you might like Zombieland ...... but if you only have enough time in life to see one Zombie-spoof movie, then watch SHAWN OF THE DEAD instead."
5,Amazing!,"Saw this movie in theatres 2 days in a row! This is by far the best zombie movie I have ever seen, all of the actors are amazing and best of all the movie is in good taste. A must buy without question."
1,defective product,"amazon had this item out of stock. so they sent me to movie mars. movie mars sent me a dvd that wouldnt read in any of the 3 dvd players that i own. it would read, ( wrong region code ). and to top it all off the tabs that hold the dvd in place are broken inside. the dvd arrived loose in the case. i never returned it because i dont have the time to and now im out $10....."
4,Just a movie......or a warning......,"There have been rumors of a Zombie invasion for awhile now.The CDC does have files on ""zombies"" and a manual on how tosurvive a zombie or other such invasion following a naturalincident, as some people are thinking might happen at theend of 2012. Is Zombieland really a training film or justa ""fresh"" take on zombie movies? You have to decide foryourself. Pay attention to the ""Zombie Survival Guide""though, you can get some good tips and also watch for thehumor Woody Harrelson shows, as most true tough guys/manhunters have that hard edge humor. The movie has alot ofgood action scenes and a few twists and turns. Two thingsit does teach, trust no one, you don't really know, whensomething like this happens and NEVER LEAVE any one behind.So again......is it just a movie......or is it a WARNING.You decide......make sure your right."
3,"Fun, but dumb","Yet another twist on the over saturated zombie movie genre. I watched it twice to see if I'd ""appreciate"" the movie more, didn't really help. Any-who, not for kids, but not a gore-fest like some of it's counterparts."
2,Just didn't do it for me.,"There were some bright spots of brilliance in this film, expecially at the beginning. I loved the ""Double Tap"" for instance, but overall it just didn't do it for me. I was expecting a comedy or even a dark comedy, but it was much more of a horror film than I expected. Much fewer laughs than I wanted. I love the cameo that occurs towards the end. I can't give this more than 2 stars though."
4,Very funny movie just like...,"Very funny movie just like Shawn of the dead. Zombieland from start to finish you can help but laugh and at times get gross out by the zombies. I thought the casting for the movie was done very well by getting Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson made a great team together. So if your in the mood for a movie that combines elements of Superbad, Shawn of the dead and few other horror comedies then pick this movie up and enjoy an evening of laughs and gross out humor."
4,Great movie! Zombie Lovers Dream!,This is such a great movie. Woody Harrelson is awesome in it. The shipping was great and the product came quickly and in perfect condition.
3,"Sometimes funny, sometimes gory, thin storyline","""Zombieland"" is a mildly funny attempt at mixing goofiness with gore. It has its moments, but mostly it just trundles along, covering now-familiar territory with a modicum of wit and humor. The much-touted ""surprise cameo appearance"" is fun, but lasts only a few minutes."
4,"Zombie, Zombie, and Woody","Good solid Zombie comedy. Woody is laugh out loud funny in Zombieland. The Bill Murry cameo also great, and yes, everyone regrets Garfield.Should have put more of the rules under special features for the dvd is my only con."
5,great movie,"one of the funnier movies ive seen, also great that it has emma stone in it. It is definitely a movie you can watch repeatedly"
5,More Than Awsome,"I love this movie. If you need a movie that is pure fun, enjoyable, funny and just great, this is the movie for you. This movie should be rated A+ on a zombie movie scale. I am under 18 and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Watch this movie!"
4,Entertaining!!!,this film is so gooda and funny and also kinda scary but why zombies are running so fast in this film?!:D anyway fun movie
3,No Digital Copy,"This rating is not for the movie which I would give 4-5 stars, it is for the product itself. I was looking forward to having the digital copy to watch on my iPad and iPhone, but the digital download expired 2/2/11. So if you are looking for the digital download, you missed it!"
3,Classic!,"This wasn't as funny as I had heard it would be. But if you're looking for a movie that you don't have to pay much attention to, in order to figure out what is happening, this movie is it. Woody Harrelson, as usual, delivers a solid performance."
2,Digital copy is expired.,"Good price for a Blu-Ray, but they never mentioned that the digital copy is expired. It say that right on the back of the cellophane wrapping. There are two discs, sure. One of them is a digital copy, and it is expired.Please be 100% honest in your product description."
4,This movie was great!,"I wish that there were more Woody Harrelson movies! But, honestly, now, I really don't remember the movie. We were laughing out loud at the absurdity, at the time."
5,Love It,"Great movie, very funny. Incredible actors. My whole family enjoyed the entire movie. The cast together was awesome, it probably would not have been as good with a different mix of cast."
4,suprising,"This was a terrible movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Very lite despite its title. A fun watch. Pop some popcorn, get a Coke and prepare to n o t be scared."
2,Bite me,"This animal is not worth the plastic it is recorded on.Everyone becomes a zombie with the standard zombie contact lenses and the standard zombie propensity to slurp on stringy flesh.In the case of this DVD, the best parts are the Blu-Ray advertisements. However if you insist on going further I suggest that you skip straight to the extras and just listened to the voiceover commentaries were everyone pats their own back.If you're propensity, watch this sort of thing I still suggest you skip this film and if you must have a zombie fix of this sort be sure to watch ""Zombie Campout"" (2002) as even though this is also an awful movie it has more social redeeming features.Oh all right, watch it. But it's not as if I didn't warn you. Bill Murray looks old and shot in this film.Zombie Campout"
2,Zombieland=Not enough zombies,Im the type of guy who grew up on the original films night of the living dead and its remake in 90 dawn of the dead day of the dead the all time greats when shaun of the dead came along it thought it was great good fx great violance plenty of zombies and the humer was just right for me im in my 30's i went to see this kinda expecting the same i was let down badly first of all i think the only thing good in this film were the few zombie moments but those moments are to few and far between and come on mad cow made people into zombies that was a real bomb i went into this thinking it might be another shaun of the dead but insted got american pie with some gore if you want true funney zombie films check out peter jacksons deadalive are shaun of the dead i think the zombie comidies need to end because any true zombie fan wont like this because mabye 30 mins of the entire film are the only time you see zombies skip it
2,"RUBEN FLEISCHER, OPUS ONE","When vampires can walk at day and zombies run like Carl Lewis, there is for good something rotten in Hollywood kingdom. Zombieland reminded me of these westerns of the early seventies when Terence Hill and Bud Spencer literally killed the genre by making us laugh at their clownings. So go back to George A. Romero. And fast. Already forgotten."
1,zombieland bd,When I went to open the dvd there was no plastic cover and the bd dvd was missing. The only thing in it was the digital copy. Now what do I do?
3,Teen,"Kind of chic-flic. The girls were more manly than the boys were. Hope you like cheese on your popcorn, this movie is cheesy."
2,Very Boring Movie,"This was a boring and cheaply written, very lean on plot. Not very intricate at all and I had to attempt to watch it 4 times before actually being able to complete the piece. Amazing feat considering this is a zzzzzzzzzombie movie with guns."
3,Not really a horror flick,"Zombieland was not what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting more of a Night of the Living Dead type of film. The beginning and end had zombies, but not much action in the middle of the film.The middle of this film kind of dragged, especially the Bill Murray part.Not a bad movie. It's fun to watch but it's not a scary horror movie."
4,Spectacular Zombie Satire,"I am not a fan of horror movies, and especially zombie movies like ""Dawn of the Dead"". However, I love movies that make fun of horror movies and zombie movies. Zombieland, like Shaun of the Dead, does this extremely well. Woody Harrelson's character is a parody of a butt-kicking action hero, while Jesse Eisenberg's character is like a young Woody Allen trying to survive a plague of zombies while battling social ineptness, various neuroses, paranoia, and oh yes, a crippling phobia of clowns. This ""odd couple"" work very well together to produce a very solid film."
4,great zombie flick,"rented it,if your looking for a zombie movie that doesn't make you sleep with one eye open then this might be for you, funny as hell, they managed to lighten the killing and the whole end of the world theme with a ton of well written jokes,like the twinkee joke, great movie, worth a rent."
3,Zombies at Six Flags?,"I gave this movie a 3 star rating however it should be 3.75 stars. It had some great scenes and some other parts that were so so.I loved Bill Murray in this movie. It has a great cast and a good story. The film was it was hit and miss overall. However, I would say go see this movie. It provides plenty of laughs. If you like zombies and comedy don't miss this one."
5,Had me laughing from start to finish.,"You just have to see this movie to understand what its about. It is just an absolutly hilarious take on horror films. This movie has more humour in it than shawn of the dead. It does have a great story line in it, and the actors do a great job keeping a straight face when you know they want to just be rolling around laughing. Anyone that likes horror comedy needs to see this film."
4,Funnier than Shaun of the Dead? Maybe!,"This movie was funny and clever and gripping from its opening moments.Very well cast and directed, with a cameo towards the end that by itself is worth the price of rental.I was pleasantly surprised,to say the least. Who knew there could be yet another fresh take on this overdone genre? A thrill ride from start to finish. Double tap!And remember: some rules are made to be broken."
4,"""Time to nut up or shut up."" Blu ray review","This movie is nothing but fun! We find ourselves in a country where zombies rule the land and rules of survival must be followed, just ask our reluctant hero ""Columbus"" (Eisenberg). If you loved SHAUN OF THE DEAD, you'll love ZOMBIELAND. The one liners are killer, especially those delivered by ""Tallahassee"" (Harrelson). There is a cameo in this movie to ""die for"" as well. All in all this is lots of fun.MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Pristine picture and crystal clear sound! Enjoyable special features. FINAL VERDICT: WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP."
5,"""Nut up or Shut up""","Absolutely hilarious, a great zombie flick that is defiantly worth buying. I went and saw this movie and laughed the whole entire time, there is not a dull moment in the entire movie."
2,YAWN of the Dead,"There is obviously HEAVY media spin going on with this film. There is no plot, nothing. Rent it. Trust me."
2,Only mildly entertaining...,"Only mildly entertaining...but really--this film goes nowhere special.There are so many better comedy/horror films that fulfill an engaging plot, adventure, and/or have an interesting lesson to learn about mankind.All this movie did was show me how much Woody's character likes Twinkies."
5,zombies zombies zombies,i love this movie got it at a killer price and enjoy watching zombie killing car stealing action a deffinatly must see
5,Great Movie,This movie was awesome. The blu-ray made the movie so crystal clear. I was always a fan of the movie so I decided to pick it up. The only downside is that the digital copy had expired but I guess that is what you expect for a three year old movie.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,This movie is just plain STUPID ! The movie is still playing while I write this. It SUCKS !
2,ugh!,Too graphic and gross for me! I LOVED Shaun of the Dead...but with this movie I spent at least half the time hiding my eyes!
4,Intimate Zombie Movie,"Zombieland is a movie that shows you do not need a big cast, a big budget or a three hour running time to make a good genre movie. It is a tight script, well acted, with enough gore and laughs to please any Zombie lover."
5,A Guilty Pleasure,"As zombie movies go, this one is a lot of fun. If your concerned about gratuitous violence, well it's a zombie movie. The violence factor is high, but the gore factor is low. If you like dark humor with a lot of violence, this movie is for you. Eisenberg and Harrelson play off each other very well and there's some subtle humor that some may find even more entertaining then the obvious stuff. I had anticipated cameo appearances and was only slightly disappointed when there was only one, but a good one. Zombie fans, eat up! Pun definitely intended."
2,Should have been better than it was...,"This movie had a lot going for it (funny title, interesting trailers, good cast) and I really expected to like it. From a slow start it staggered along like the zombies in the story, never interesting enough to make me care about the characters or what would happen next. If you have to see it, then rent it or borrow it but don't buy it until you are sure you like it. You may not."
2,This stinker does not deserve the accolades,"I was very disappointed with this movie for one reason...not enough zombies!It starts out great and Jessee Eisenberg is a very likeable actor (he ""made"" Adventureland). The movie starts out great with his character's rules for dealing with a zombie culture. The problem is, that once the four main characters get together, there's too much talking and not enough zombies.Woody Harelson was interesting and the Bill Murray cameo was great. ""Shaun of the Dead"" knew how to integrate horror and comedy but this movie quickly morphed into an uninteresting ""road movie"" I know this is not supposed to be highbrow entertainment but I was expecting much more from this. The trailer truly shows you everything you need for this one."
3,Gotta get me a twinkie now!,"Ok, at first this seemed like a very strange, very badly acted movie. You quickly realize that is actually part of what makes it fun. I've actually seen it several times since then and its now almost comedic, but not in the sense that you would actually laugh outloud at jokes."
2,You're Not Clever if You're Pointless,"The movie started off fairly decent. A stereotypical neurotic dweeb-heeb details his hard and fast rules for survival in Zombieland. What a nice boy and yes, how cliché. Had to endure his fragile voiced narration throughout.The scenes in the Bill Murray Mansion were pointless and just went on forever. Unless you consider the obvious, and narrated in case you're too stupid to get it, bonding scenes poignant and integral. In a comedy send-off of a zombie film they're not.I was at the turn-off point here. Very boring and brought the movie to a complete halt.The scenes in the amusement park were inexplicable and anticlimactic.The trailer falsely led you to believe that this film would have more comical zombie slayings and zombie interactions. In fact, all of them were given away in the trailer (about 6!).Wait for it on TNT if you must!"
2,Zombieland Review,"I was very disappointed when I received this movie. Simply, because it wasn't sealed, and no advertisement explained that it wouldn't be wrapped. If you decide to buy ""Zombieland"" be sure not to purchase it from ""importcd."""
1,I should have made movies for a living,"I have no idea what anyone really sees in this movie. It really undermines Woodys' talent and is boring, pointless and was a waste of time. I had to force myself to watch all of it. Considering this movie has mostly 5 star ratings im inclined to believe I should have made movies for a living. This movie made a lot of money and was garbage yet most of the U.S seems to think its just great. I could move the topic towards politics now.....But you really dont want to hear that rant......I have a very nice movie collection. Movies we buy get saved in the collection even if they are just ""fair"". Below my fair rating doesnt make it on our shelves and this one will only see itself sold on Amazon for a penny. Funny thing is everyone I talk to thinks it was horrible yet everyone is rating it good?"
1,my new favorite movie,"This is my new faverite movie it's like Juno with zombies. As soon as I was rocking out to \m/METTALICA\m/ at the beggening I knew I was in for a wild thrill ride. It has some great writting and humor, like when the little girl said ""12 is the new 20."" AAHAHAHAHA. My favorite part was when the surly survivalist type guy liked twinnkies! LMFAO! he like's twiknkies but he' sa tough guy but he likes twinekies anyway.............. lol......"
1,Dumbest zombie movie since Lou Diamond Phillips' Route 666,"I know zombie movies are just supposed to be harmless fun that you suspend disbelief somewhat to enjoy, but how did these girls manage to operate carnival rides while riding them? In a zombie Apocalypse? And why is the electricity still on everywhere? *yawn* Woody Harrelson is hard to dislike in anything he's in, and this is no exception, but what is with Jesse Eisenberg? He is like the poor-man's Michael Cera. Except way more annoying and unlikable. Go see a zombie movie worth seeing, like the original ""Dawn of the Dead (Divimax Edition)"" or the not strictly zombie pic ""28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)."" Zombieland: What a load of junk, and not even any fun when considered as parody. It even manages to make Bill Murray seem boring and unfunny. Glad I saw it on demand for five bucks instead of paying for it permanently. To wrap up: Just plain awful."
1,Horrible Skip It,"The worst movie of the year. No plot no originality, and a clearly embarrassed cast seems to struggle through this childish cartoon."
1,what havn't we seen yet?,Maybe I nodded off but what the hell happened? They went somewhere - that was boring. They got kidnapped and that was boring. And they named people after stuff. And that was also boring. Some cute kills - not really.Hey Mickey Rourke was great in the Wrestler - what made you think he'd be good in Iron Man 2 - oh wait this was Woody Harrelson who was cool in 2012 but sucked in Zombieland. Lighting was above average.
4,Love it,"I have been watching Zombie movies for 30+ years. This one is good. Lots oF guns ( a must need for zombies) and humor. The part with BM was very funny. The only disappointment was the plot about going to a theme park?? And when the girls get there they make all this noise and wonder why the zombies attack?? oh well, nice try. All in all a very good movie"
5,Zombieland blu ray dvd,"Bluray arrived as brand new, great movie to watch if you don't own it, now is the time to go out and buy it in stores or online."
2,JWVHIII,"This movie got enough positive word of mouth when it was in the theaters for me to get a copy of the DVD when it came out. I expected Woody to carry the film comedically but was sadly disappointed to find that the film lacked any shred of sophistication or cleverness. It was just another sensless zombie fest whose repetitive calling card was unimaginative dispatch of zombies. On a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being the best I rate Zombieland a ""3""."
2,Zombieland or Teen Angst?,"Actually, for both a zombie movie and a Woody Harrelson lover like myself, I found this film quite disappointing. I mean, some of the zombie stuff was quite good and some was quite funny, there just wasn't enough. But that's not what this film was really about and therein lies my disappointment. It was a teen romance movie plain and simple; it was just disguised as a zombie flick most likly to get folks like me to buy a ticket. That's why I'm having a problem with it. By the way, Woody was Woody and that's always good, and it was Woody, more than anything else, that got this film an extra star; in my humble opinion."
2,"Not particularly scary or funny, just stupid.","I didn't quite know what to expect from Zombieland and expected something similar to Sean of the Dead. It had a good cast and the first 10 minutes were great. Unfortunately the film was all downhill from there and dragged on another 100 minutes to its entirely predictable conclusion.The movie really couldn't make up its mind on what it wanted to be: romantic comedy, slapstick, horror light, and the viewing audience suffered for it.At least I didn't see it in the theaters."
2,Meh,"I started Zombieland expecting to laugh hysterically from beginning to end. Minus a couple Hostess and Bill Murray-related chuckles, I was rather disappointed. I'm aware that I'm in the minority here, but it didn't deliver as a horror movie or a comedy. Woody Harrelson's character was moderately funny, but the rest of the cast was pretty awful. The kid was flawed way beyond being sympathetic, well into simply pathetic, and the girls were not likable. At all. I'd have given it 1.5 stars if possible.Bottom line, lots of people adored Zombieland, but it only made me want to watch Shaun of the Dead."
1,Movie is great. Sony continues to prove themselves a terrible company.,"Zombieland is an excellent movie - funny, and it has zombies. What more could you ask? This copy of the blu-ray, however, is a complete rip off. One of the reasons I purchased this version was that it came with the digital copy, but the digital copy had expired before I purchased the disc. This is fraud, plain and simple. If you're going to advertise a digital copy as part of what you get when you purchase the product, then I own the digital copy. Sony yet again proves they have no interest in providing good (or even honest) customer service."
3,Post-Apocalypse,"This horror-comedy click is of the people in the land where majority was turned into zombies after a virus epidemic.If this work is without some hidden bottom-line dealt with present, it would hardly comprehend simply contradicting moments in the story of the post-apocalypse USA."
4,Fun. But not great.,"Fun. Some very clever stuff. But just ... ""not quite"". There really weren't any character arcs or growth to invest in and thus no real reward. Fun. Definitely fun. But not great."
5,Hilarious movie! highly recommended!,"I watch this movie every time I'm feeling sad, or just want to laugh. The characters are amazing. Although, I'm not a fan of a lot of the language or really gruseome parts, I still give this five stars. It's hilaious!"
4,A Funny Movie,Zombieland is good movie. It incorporates action with some laughs. This is a movie you can watch more than one time and want to watch more than one time. A good movie for a good deal.
5,Best comical zombie movie,Bill Murray is cameo is classic. I can't hear When the Bells Toll without thinking of this movie now. CARDIO!
5,Love this movie!,I am a zombie groupie. This one is like no other; it adds humor to the oh-so-common zombie apocalypse dilemma. Besides you have to relate to the search for a good Twinkie. LOL
2,Zombie movies are Lame and this one is no exception.,"If you enjoy watching a friend play the Sony Playstation for an hour and 20 minutes then you'll probably enjoy this movie. Jessie Eisenberg should stick to films about computer geeks. Harrelson proves yet again his natural born instinct for killing.. in this case, zombies. This movie didn't try to take itself seriously obviously but was still a far cry from funny or anything even approaching clever. But if you're looking for all the plot intricasies of a video game then you may have found your movie here."
4,Very humorous dark comedy,"Kept me laughing throughout the movie.Really enjoyed it. The local pub, the romantically inept, and the zombies chomping down on family and friends - what's not to enjoy."
3,Amazon Digital Version,"The movie itself is great on both DVD and Blu-ray.The quality of the amazon digital version is very low. Is very blocky even on a midsize screen. Despite the fact Amazon advertises their movies as DVD quality its nowhere close. I even downloaded it just to be sure, and the quality was still the same."
5,A fun film.,"This film is great if you are looking for a just plain fun film to watch. Otherwise, you may be disappointed."
5,sweet flick!,Love the rules to living in zombie land. Super fun film and bound to be a classic. I'm craving a Twinkie about now.
4,Hilarious!,"Lots of funny jokes and situations, acting was surprisingly good, characters had great chemistry and played off each other very well, and zombies galore! I like it! XD"
4,zombie kill of the week goes to......,"Ok for starters im not the biggest horror fan, nor am i the biggest zombie anything fan, but this movie is just plain fun. Just enough plot to keep the movie going a romp through a nation overrun by zombies as we follow a group of survivors on their search for Twinkies and pacific play land, which if nothing else i give credit for informing the future masses what a Twinkie is now that they are no more since hostess went under a few months back. sometimes fun is just fun and remember to enjoy the little things"
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special","A few laughs here and there and the whole amusement park action stuff was cool. Other than that its pretty stupid and corny, plus Amber Heard the hottest chick turns zombie and dies way too soon. I watched the rest of the movie thinking how much better it would be if she was still around."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"Excellent burner! Easy installation, XP-Prof. picked it up right away. I've burned several DVD+R and a couple of DVD+RW and few CD-R's with great results. Very fast burner. I've got other software I like but the little package that came with the burner is really pretty good! You can't go wrong with this burner!"
1,what is this book about ??? nothing- its repetitive,"thats the problem with these nobel prize winners- people are blinded by that medal and afraid to write a negative review about them. as if that would show the reviewers ignorance (""how could you NOT love a nobel prize winner, something must be wrong with YOU"" )but please, what was this book about ??? two people who looked alike and stared at each other for a long time and got confused as to who was who??? it was boring . and for a book so short, its amazing how repetitive it was . (they keep going to a table and writing and looking at each other)it had no history in it like people say. maybe it mentions a historical figure or a conflict- but thats it . and mr pamuks ability to convey time stinks in this book. suddenly its 15 yrs later, suddenly its 25 yrs later.pretty much a pointless book that is so ""eventless"" that it gives you a headache.sorry orphan, maybe your other books are good."
3,A good book by a great writer,"I can tell it is from early i n his career. Having read several of his other books this one is similar but lacks the power of his later works, but it is still well worth the read."
2,The first novel by a distinguished writer but suggest you read another of his works.,"This short novel never raised itself above the parapet. My view is that anyone new to Pamuk will be left disappointed. I really enjoyed 'My Name is Red'. Sadly this novella was short of anything satisfying: no plot, cut out characters and periphiral interest. Pamuk was obviously trying to make a point about the narrator bearing such a close resembance to Hoja but he failed to connect with me. The relationship between the narrator and Hoja was painful reading and I never fathomed why Hoja should have such a hold over the narrator, portrayed in the early stages of the book as a highly intelligent and resourceful young man. Those with imaginative minds will find a pertinent underlying thread but whatever that may be the substance of the book is still bland."
4,Scientific thought in Ottoman Empire,"This book reflects the conditions of the Ottoman Empire in 17 th century, with the eyes of Turkish Scientist- at least he thoughts he is a scientist. I recommend you to read this book if you are interested in the Ottoman Empire and development of scientific thought."
1,Native orientalism at work,"Pamuk is surely one of the few well-known Turkish writers. However, he is at the same time one of the most perfect examples of native Orientalism-- Orientalism that is launched and defended by the natives of lands that had been colonized. In his novel every detail is designed to fit the taste of the western perspective on Islam and muslims: exotic, erotic, and thus intriguing; hidden, unknown and thus dangerous. In this sense, I would rather suggest the work not as a literary favorite, but rather as a showcase for students of political theory and international affairs."
3,Unimpressive,"I read this book after hearing so much praise about this work. However enlightening this reading was, I didn't like the fiction. There is this intrigue of the magic reality, where the narrator meets his alter-ego, that the critics love so much, but this somehow didn't work in this Ottoman tapestry. In this respect and particularly the case for middle-age fiction in general, I liked Amin Malouf's fictions."
4,Engaging and thoughtful work on the nature of identity,"This is an engrossing story of an outsider stranded in another culture who learns about himself, others and perhaps the nature of identity itself. I couldn't put it down."
2,Booooring,"I gave this book a big chance, but I thought it was boring and never really got to the point. It could have dealt with interesting themes about identity and science, but I don't think it did them justice."
4,A Turkish Delight,One of the most engaging and imaginative novels I've read in the last 12 months. It contrasts two cultural worlds -- the 17th-century scientific and technological advancement of Christian Venice with the Muslim centre of Constantinople -- and the intellectual engagement of a scholar from each.
4,Almost Perfect!,"This camera takes good video quality and good picture quality (about 1MP). I bought this camera to possibly be a good all-in-one camera, pictures and video. The 30GB holds more than I need and it is easy to transfer to a Computer. My only problem at all with this camera is that it does not have a flash. I believe the Sony SR200 and SR300 have a flash. So, it turns out that for taking pictures indoors it is still better for me to use my other sony Camera. Other than that this camera fits all my needs and I think it actually works out better that I use this camera for video and the other for pics."
3,Can do better for the price,"Samiliar if not worse video quality as an old tape driven handy cam,only advantage is the HD, but you can get similar performance from other makes for much lesser."
1,DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A MAC !!!,"The enclosed software does not support Mac OS.The only software for Mac the will work with this format is Capity Mpeg edit, a horrible program that will run you an extra $200.It is included with the JVC HDD camera.I love SONY and the camera is nice but without the ability to put it on my computer the HDD is useless."
5,Sony does it again!,"Having used a Sony Hi8 camcorder for 9 years, I was more than happy to go with Sony again. I have been very impressed by the camera and the ease with which I can now transfer movies to computers and DVDs. I take a lot of family video and the camera is perfect for that purpose. Not having a separate viewer can make outdoor shooting more challenging, especially if zoomed up. Getting an extended battery is definitely worthwhile! The still picture feature is better than I expected based on what I saw on online reviews. I can see it coming in handy, even if it is only 1 megapixels in resolution."
3,Good Quality,"This camera has good quality, yet you may have to convert the video format every time like I do, which can sometimes be a pain. It doesn't come with a neck strap, but that's only a minor thing. The touch screen is really nice and it turns on/off very quickly. It didn't take me very long to find out how to use it, so it is pretty simple. It has proficient audio quality, yet an external microphone would work a lot better. It will zoom pretty far and it has a ""switch"" lens cap, which will not get in the way of filming. Also, you can choose to film in widescreen or a standard 4:3 aspect."
1,Is a garbage - basura,"La compré en junio 07, la usé ocasionalmente hasta diciembre cuando estaba en una filmacion de mi hija y se apagó y no prendió mas. Tenía como 20 gigas de filmación en el disco duro que son muchas horas de recuerdos. Anteriomente tuve muy mala experiencia con una filmadora digital JVC y quise cambiarla por la Sony justamente porque me fué muy bien con mi primera filmadora análoga Sony hecha en JAPON. La DSC-SR62 es hecha en JAPON pero es una basura. Definitivamente me iré por CANON porque me ha ido excelente con sus cámaras digitales. La calidad de filmación de la sony DSC-SR62 era regular pero suficiente para los videos caseros. No la recomiendo justamente por la gran capacidad que tiene de almacenar video y de perderlo tambien, como en mi caso."
5,Great,"We use with the pitching machine and the kids love the yellow balls. Feel just like the weight of a baseball. The kids prefer the yellow balls over the white. Overall, worth the money."
5,Great,Great balls. I have a zooka and they make the strike zone more frequent with theses balls. Regular baseballs are all over the place but these are nice. I need to get some more.
4,real deal ''standing up against the man'' type of movie,The characters in this movie really act out the reality of what truly went on openly in a world a racism in the 60's and 70's.This movie is a guide for the 21st century of minorities who are victims of hidden racism.
5,The Final Comedown,Excellent copy depicting Billy Dee Williams only movie made in the Black-exploitation movie era. Don't expect too much from this movie..it's da message.
1,I cannot believe how horrible this movie is,The quality of this movie is symbolically summed up with its misspelled title on the DVD menu.
4,Great Ideas for Girls,I bought this as part of our research as civil war Reenactors. My girls love it. So many non TV or electronis means of entertainment. And to kids today its all new and fresh. Not only have the learned things they can do to keep them selves busy and entertained at events. They also have plenty to do at home.If your looking for some fun fresh ideas for todays kids try looking to the past. From stories and games to learning simple sewing and all written to the child and most involve little supplies or props.
4,best of the best,"warren haynes live at bonnaroo. warren haynes is without a doubt one of the best guitarists of all time. on top of that, his voice is absolutely amazing. he always keeps himself busy, whether he is touring with gov't mule, the allman brothers, the dead, or any of his other side projects. this album is great to listen to whether you are driving, doing some house work, or trying to sleep. It is not easy to cover all of those but somehow he finds a way. My favorite track on the album is his cover of ""Stella Blue."" his voice is perfect for covering Jerry, and also for filling in with the allman brothers. He will be at Delfest this year... SEE HIM!!! you will not regret it."
5,Warren Haynes at his best...,If you are a fan of Warren Haynes then this is a must to have in your collection... nothing about this cd will disappoint you. I Love it!
3,"Good, not great",I am a huge Warren Haynes fan. It's always a pleasure to hear him play and sing. There are a few gems on this but also a few I could do without.
4,great look,"These sunglasses fit perfectly, if you are second guessing if you want to get these or not don't. There great! And they look good, almost like the real thing"
1,I lost my money,"I received my sunglasses last week, they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions. they have three lines on them, and simply I feel that I lost my money. I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportation"
1,Please choose another one,"I don't recommend this camera at all... I bought this camera for my vacation but the shot button doesn't seem to work everytime. It seems like the camera is taking a long time of trying to focus (especially outdoor!) and that takes me out of many chances for wonderful pictures. Also, I only used it for 5 rolls of film so far(I will return it tomorrow, no more), and there's already 1 roll got stuck and I have to bring to the camera store to recover my pictures...it's really a horrible experience."
1,It was passable while it lasted,"Before it died, this was an acceptible camera. Unfortunately the automatic lens features fell apart and Fuji refuses to fix it without a store receipt AND the warranty card. It's unreasonable to refuse to fix obvious manufacturing defects.In particular, the automatic lens cover doors no longer function, and the lens will not zoom. Since the lens cover won't open, the camera's as good as dead.I'm thoroughly unhappy with Fuji's customer service, and this camera is to be avoided."
1,Not recommended.,"I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars."
5,A Fun Read!,"The Crown of Anavrea is a gripping story with greatly developed characters and a clean romance. Even though it is short enough to be an easy one or two day read, I definitely didn't want it to end! The Crown of Anavrea's plot explodes into complexity within the first couple of pages, and ends in a nicely tied-up and well rounded story. I enjoyed it very much and eagerly await the second book in the Theodoric Saga!"
4,Romance and adventure,"I don't read much fantasy, but I enjoyed this one by Rachel Rosanno. A short, clean, very sweet romance with a bit of high paced adventure mixed in. And the tease at the end for the second book in the series, The King of Anavrea, has me eager for more."
5,A delightful story,"I had such fun reading this book! The Crown of Anavrea always puts me in a happy mood. I never get tired of reading it, which is why it's the most read and re-read book on my shelf. :)"
5,Review of Uddhava Gita,"This book is great for all spuritual seekers, regardless of their inclination and practice, it is full of advices for enlightenment and final goal.I read this book and was greatly inspired from teachings of Lord Krishna herein.I recomend for purchase it is valuable treatise of ancient wisdom"
5,Awesome film!,"I use this film in my Canon Rebel and just love it! Most of what I take looks like a postcard with this film. I've photographed things in the worst lighting conditions with no problems whatsoever with this film. It can be light at times, depending on the developer, but all-in-all, I'm VERY satisfied with this film and buy it quite frequently. Most of what I use it for are photographs of family, but it is also used for items pictured on ebay and it just does a wonderful job. I can't recommend this film enough!"
3,It worked,Very grainy on outdoor shots.Good quality indoors. Good colors on indoor. Colors ran outdoorsI would recommend for indoor
5,No bargain!,I was expecting a deal! Without trying too hard I can get this product for under [amt] and even less with a coupon.
1,vacation,"I was unable to use this film in my camera. I bought 12 rolls and had to return them. I have a Samsung Fino 105S Maxima Zoom. I am only able to use either the 100, 200, or 400 speeds in my camera."
4,Very informative book,"Very informative book, lots of great ideas and real world examples. I learned alot reading this book."
1,Dont waste your money. Limited angle of view,"I bought a pair, installed on my car and my kids cant see anything. The viewing angle is terrible, so only an adult can see it if right positioned. More than 10 or 15 degrees and you dont see anything. Waste of money."
2,As substantial as a piece of chocolate,"Cashing in on the craze for anthologies (supposedly ""inspirational""), Allenbaugh has cobbled together a book of anecdotes. The women write them for free; Allenbaugh rakes in the dough. The connections between the stories, and the stories and the book's theme are as insubstantial as bon bon for dinner--which makes the ""chocolate"" thing one part of the book that works, I guess."
5,Chocolate as nourishment! You bet!,"I really enjoyed this book - it was great to be able to sit down and read as I pleased; skipping around, or reading sections in order - just like a box of chocolates.I found the stories to be grounded in the reality of everyday life; but inspiring. You can either let life get you down, or work through problems and gain experience and wisdom. Take what you've learned from a difficult experience and run with it; ultimately, only we ourselves can make ourselves happy. This collection of short stories take the ideas above, and adds to it.Read this book - you won't regret it."
5,"Inspirational, encouraging, heart-warming.","These stories touch your heart and soul. I'm sure that many women are encouraged and inspired to fulfill their dreams, make necessary changes in their lives and are reaffirmed that who they are is just fine. I was so touched by these books that I have given Kay's books to my three grown daughters and many of my friends as gifts. I love the theme of Kay's books - empowering, encouraging and supporting women in whatever they choose for their lives! Keep up the good work, Kay!"
1,As empty of true nourishment as a Snickers Bar,"I found this book to be very disappointing. The authors seem to find their joys in strange and curious ways, like the women who, after applying a torniquet to a man's arm after a terrible car accident, later realizes that she didn't get anything on her white suit and wasn't late for her appointment. Another story tells of a psychic reading which gives a woman the motivation to leave her unfaithful husband. This is supposed to feed my spirit and warm my heart? Yuck!Also note that this book is written with a New Age point of view."

3,outer limits mutations,I was kinda dissapointe there werent more episode. the one that were onthe disc's were very good.
3,What is the fuss?,"Ok, I just finished reading this book, basically because I am going to see the theatre production this weekend, and somehow missed the movie when it came out on the 80's. (Actually, not really tue, I did start the movie two times, as a pre-teen, and it went way over me)So, anyway, I thought being older, I would be able to appreciate this Pulitzer winning novel.While it was a fast-read, and had its redeeming points, I just could not see why it got such high critical acclaim. I felt the whole ""letters-from-Africa"" plot was totally derailing, and it would have been so much better to enhance Celie's life instead, focusing more on her rise and ""victory""Maybe I just have to wait another 25 years to truly appreciate this book.. lot more maturity to attain..."
3,Review of the Color Purple,"This book is about about a fourteen year old girl named Celie who goes through alot in this book. At the beginning of the book it starts off tragic for Celie. Both her brother and mother died. After that a man (a complete stranger) named Albert asks Celie's father for her hand in marriage even though he wanted her sister Nettie more than her. So, she goes and lives with him and basically she becomes his ""slave"". She cooks,cleans, and looks after his children. After so many years of being with her abusive husband (Albert) who beats her and trats her bad, Celie finally stands up to him and she walks out on him. Then after that Albert was basically a ""mess"". His house was a complete mess, his animals were never fed, and he always got drunk."
4,The Color Purple,"This was very interesting. At some parts in the middle I got confused, but in the ending I started to understand a bit better. I feel so sorry for Celie and Nettie, being apart so long. If you love a chick flick, pick this book up right away."
2,A poor book,"After seeing the movie I thought the book would be good, but I was wrong. This has to be the only book I say is worse than the movie. I was not a fan of Walkers style nor how she orgainized it. Read it because it's an Ameican classic but- well, just read it."
3,What you got,"You surly do feel for the main character Celie, but the book could have been a drop more powerful. Something was missing. I expected more. But you sure did get an awful lot anyhow."
3,Great Moments,"Walker's relationships were well-developed. I will certainly give her that. And the first half of this book, as I watched Celie go from victim to entrepreneur, was most entertaining. The time spent with Shug is a brilliant relationship. BUT the latter half of the book proved dry. I might go so far as to assert it was unnecessary. Disappointing after seeing just how well Walker can write."
3,excellent.,"i'd give it 3.5 stars, really. the ending kind of left me hanging. it's a good book about beauty, sexuality and gender roles. the main character celie comes to grips with her past, her sexual orientation, her body and beauty. one of those brainy kind of books you'd have to read for english class."
5,Inspiration,"I really enjoyed reading this novel and it was very inspiring. It's about an uneducated black woman who had a low self esteem and was dominated by a male. Things change when another woman taught her self respect and independance.This easy to follow novel keeps your interest at all times and always has something going on within the story. With no illustrations in the book, you are still able to imagine the events.I think the authors intent was to point out the effect of male domination and poverty living as a black female. Also, to send a message to all that self pride lies within yourself and no matter how bad things may be, you can always find happiness."
5,Reading the color purple changed my life,"Reading 'The Color Purple' has been a enticing experience for me, before this i did not really understand the meaning of discrimination and the power of male dominance. I feel this novel is of excellant standards and feel i can really identify with Celie myself. Being from an ethnic background i did myself experience the power of male dominance and like celie i did not speak up, as for me it became my own normal lifestlye. Now after reading this novel it has encouraged me to speak up in my own rights and has changed my life compleatly. I greatly recommend viewers to read this novel as it may bring hope into your life or maybe just give you an insight of the real harsh life of people fronm ethnic backgrounds."
4,A Great Use of Time!,"As I read this book, I was in awe at the bluntness of events that take place. The dialogue is amazing. It captures very well the feelings, tone, and words of blacks in the southern portion of the United States in the early 1900s. This particular dialogue made the novel extremely interesting and gave it a certain touch of authenticity. Also, the format of the novel, in written letters between two people, held my interest. I was actually affected by the characters' experiences. The protagonist, Celie, is a character whom many are prejudiced against. Because, after a terribly long struggle to survive, she eventually finds happiness, I, too, felt liberated. This book has much to offer and is worth reading."
4,"An amazing book, sad but powerful","Alice Walker's writing style is incredible. She invents thorough, lovable (and horrible) characters enhanced by the language and descriptions of each. I would not recommend this book for people who don't enjoy sad books, because I have to admit that this book made me cry. However, this book made me cry out of happiness as well. It's a powerful, interesting book that flows along and leaves you with a wonderful feeling."
5,The emotions and heartaches of this book are heartfelt.,"The Color Purple is just a pure example of good literature. Alice Walker proves the hardship of life for those less fortunate. The painful and hard things that Celie had to go through make you feel complete passion for the girl. One of the best qualities of a book is being able to feel what the characters are feeling. In writing this book, Alice Walker did just that."
5,better with time,"great book, better than the movie.. You can't go wrong with this book. Just because you've seen the movie, its doesn't mean you know the story."
4,Powerful Story,"I first read this book many years ago when I was in my mid-teens. No matter how many times I've read this book, it's still as intense as ever. Parts of the book were a litte predictable, but I could still enjoy reading them. Alice Walker is probably one of the best authors I had ever had a chance to read from.I felt deeply for Celia because of how abused she was and how she got out of that situation. Her growth as a character was very powerful and deep impacting to the overall plot."
4,The Color Purple,It took me a while to figure out what PURPLE had to do with anything... but I finally got it.This is a story about a girl who grows up to be a strong woman. The book is better than the movie. The reading felt real as I read through the personal diary of this woman. This books shows how cruel people can be... and how forgiving people can be.
3,It was ok but not super,"It was ok but didn't hold my interest, I did finish it. I would not buy it or keep it on my bookshelf"
3,Definite unusual language,"Definitely unusual language,resulted in trying to understand what the dialog was to convey.This resulted in rereading previous paragraphs to gleam what the author was trying to convey.However,it was sometimes interesting and required alert reading."
5,It was as good as I thought it would be,"I have seen the movie at least 50 times, but I know that there are details that never get into the movie so I wanted the whole story and the book was a great read."
5,The Color Purple for Kindle,I would highly recommend this book to everyone...even if you've seen the movie. I was enthralled with it and couldn't put it down.
3,Good not great,"I GUESS I expected it to be better than the movie,I loved the movie, but in my opinion it was not."
1,5 scenes too late...,"Everything seemed okay, but when we went to watch it - and tried over and over again, the movie skips the beginning scenes of the movie. I was very disappointed at a product that was supposed to be in new condition. The DVD is useless."
1,"twisted, horrifying, disgusting, revolting, perverted, vomit-inducing, etc.","this is the worst book i've ever read, along with the house on mango street. i had to read this the summer before ninth grade. yes, ninth! i was THIRTEEN and i had to submerge myself in this perverted sick unhealthy (most likely drug-induced) for lack of a better word, BOOK. i was horrified, disgusted, revolted, terrified, and it was NOT a pleasant read. i couldn't even finish it. i stopped after about 100 pages, and akwardly had to tell my mom that i didn't want to finish it. she read it and agrees with me. why this is considered a ""CLASSIC"" is beyond me. it sounds like alice walker is on crack and wrote down the first twisted, sick, perverted scence she could think of. i would NEVER recommend this book, especially for schools."
1,The Color Purple - A Horrible Demonstration of American Literature,"Alice walker, sucks.This book was disgusting.THE END."
3,The Color Purple,"The story of Celie and the environment in which she grows and blossoms is touching, warming, even if disjointed. The style of writing is creative and worthy of the praise it has received, although it sometimes left me wanting more description of the world in which some of the other interesting characters lived, which was difficult to get when only hearing the world described through Celie's and Nettie's eyes."
4,Intensely emotional and affecting,"A novel that reveals the truths about men and women, God and love, and Blacks and Whites. Every letter has a lesson to be learned, a story to be told, or an emotion to express. A heartwarming book with faith and love woven in between the words. The authenticity of the main character's emotions keep you reading until the end. Walker is a superb writer and The Color Purple can be stand beside any literature of any time and place."
5,One of My All Time Favorites!,I loved this book. I have read it so many times I can't even count. It is one of those books you can open up to any page and just get lost in it.
5,GREAT,AMAZINGLY AWESOME .So eye opening. Shows how the changing roles of women throughout history and what life could have potentially been like
5,Color me speechless,"I was born around the time the movie had been released. So all I knew was the movie. This was my first time reading the book. I had the opportunity to use my own imagery in my head with the assistance of the authors words. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history, black history, women rights and struggles, love stories, stories of survival, women in business and etc..."
5,Excellent,Really liked this book. Although the formatting for kindle was lacking since there aren't really chapters.The story was excellent.
4,Great,This was an amazing book. U didn't like the beginning because I was confused but then it got so amazing
3,a GOOD book,"This wasn't a great book, it was little short of that, but it was definitely a good book. I loved how it covered controversial subjects. And it was poetically written. There were a few things I didn't like about it, but maybe I'm just used to a different culture than that which is presented in the book. It is a very nice book though."
4,a great representation,"What a wonderful and refreshing piece of feminist literature. Alice Walker does an amazing job of writing from the heart, soul, and mind of the black woman in this great epistological novel. The language is believable, and the characters are deep and developing.Word Ninja"
2,The Color Purple,I did read the whole book - can't say that I really enjoyed it. It was very sad for most of the book. It was rather hard to read with the black dialect but got easier the more I read. At least the ending was happy. I read it for my book club but would not recommend it for everyday reading.
4,Lady Murasaki,"I already own a paperback copy of this novel. The pages are torn, the text is highlighted yellow, and the margins are colored in graphite markings. The story is a work of art. I bought this anniversary edition to give to my girlfriend. She is Japanese and her favorite color is the color purple. I thought we could read the book together."
4,The Color Purple,"The Color Purple, by Alice Walker was a very interesting and realistic novel. In this book, Alice Walker dares to write about a topic that most authors are not brave enough to write about. She writes about the issues that young black women had to face during times of slavery and hardships. I recommand this book to everyone!"
3,Cheap but not worth it.,"It took forever to get it, and when I got it, it had really messy covers. I paid $8 for it and for $6 more you can get a clean one at barnes and noble with no waiting."
1,This is not remotely the reality of black lives in the 40's and 50's.,"I was there, in the southern end of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The ""colored people"" were not remotely as depicted in this book. Yes, they had to sit in the back of the bus, and use separate bathrooms, but they were clean, sat upright, didn't have babies out of wedlock which is so common amongst whites today. I would go over to the ""colored section"" with my scooter and made a good friend of a girl my age (10). A friend of our family was a ""colored"" nurse, and Rosalie would occasionally come and help Mom with the house, while Mom cooked up a feast for Rosalie and the rest of us. My mother's best friend in Massachusetts married a ""colored"" man, on the pale side, and they never had any trouble. This is a horrid book, and if I were black I'd be made as heck!"
2,The Color Purple,Too much emphasisplaced on the color (race) issue. I did not like it. I feel we have heard enough of this over the past decade.
3,THE COLOR PURPLE,i READ THIS BOOK SO I COULD DISCUSS IT WITH MY GRAND SON WHO IS 17. I SAW THE MOVIE SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OK. I REALLY WAS SHOCKED BY IT CONTENT. I DON' T THINK IT IS FOR YOUNG CHILDERN. THE STYLE OF HE SAID AND ISAID DROVE ME NUTS. I REALLY CN SEE THAT BLACK PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE PORTRAYED AS THEY WERE.I AM 75 AND COULD NOT GET WHO WAS WHOS FATHER OR LOVER. I BOUGHT THE CLIFF NOTES AND IT DIDN'T HELP. I LOVER THE MOVIE AND HATED THE BOOK.
2,The color purple,"First I must say that I had already seen the movie when I read this book which I don't normally do. That being said, this is a first for me in that the Movie was SO much better than the book. I am still glad that I read the book but whether you read the book or not do yourself a favor and see the movie-it is WONDERFUL!!"
4,It is a great book to read for 8th grade History,I'm in Eith grade and studdying black English. I thought it totally fit in and helped me understand what life was really like for a woman.
5,The Colour Purple,"All about growing up - at whatever age! Celie finds her true self after years of just accepting what happens to her, and eventually becomes the author of her own life. A story that will touch many, about acceptance, personal growth and coming home to oneself. All interwoven with discovering cultural roots. A++++ story."
4,The Color Purple,Over all I thought this book great. I loved how it explains the struggle for women back then and to think how far we have gotten since. The classic story of the struggle between women and man. I liked how the Alice Walker wrote to you so you were able to put yourself in Celie's shoes and better understand her situation. I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle the harsh truth of our past!
4,Everybody should read this book,This novel can be read time and time again and the reader would still find that the book is absolutely amazing.The first page of the book entices the reader to keep on reading.Every event takes place at the right timing.I found the book long but worth every minute spent reading it.The dialogue that the book is written in is excellent.The author really did a wonderful job with the plot and setting.The main character goes through many trials and tribulations in her life and learns more about herself and who she really is.Everybody should read this book. If only once in their lifetime.
4,Not Bad,The color purple is a great novel to read for the ages 15 and up. I am a high school student who totally enjoyed reading this book. Every page leaves you shocked or curious to know what is going to happen next in the story. the novel starts off with eye catching material that will have the readers wondering about the book from the beginning to the end on how exciting and different this novel might be. The color purple builds up in the beginning and has a major twist that is least expected in the middle. the novel deals with a little explicit language and homosexuality and if you are not a mature reader you should not read this novel.But the storied told in this novel tells you about a young girls life which would make you feel like your life is not so bad compared to her life after all.So go pick it up I guarantee you will love it since it is a Prize Winning Novel
5,The Color Purple review,"What a wonderful story about the life of the way it was years agoin the south. The book gives a more detailed scene of descriptionsthat can't be given in the showing of a movie. The movie and bookare outstanding, each in their own respect."
4,A great book,It was a great read. A lot of details that they did'nt add to the movie. If you love the movie you'll love the book
5,The Color Purple,The best book I have read for many years. It held my interest and was a page turner. Highly recommend.
4,Very Intereting,"I'd never read the book or seen the movie, and didn't really know what it was all about. Just knew about all the awards & acclaim they had, so I decided to read the book & see what it was all about. It wasn't what I expected, but it was very interesting, sad, a good look into life in the south for a black woman."
4,Fantasic Read,I know this is a book review but firstly the movie version is my all time favourite movie. I'm crying at the start because I already know the ending. Even though I read the book after seeing the movie many times and as usual it is slightly different to the movie the book didn't disappoint me. It was a great read. It was just like I had the movie playing in another room and I could hear the characters voices. I love how the story is told through Celie's letter to both God and Nettie. An all time favourite for me.
1,Nothing special,"The book has nothing special to offer and I cannot understand why she got the Pulitzer unless The Color is not Purple but Black. Quite frankly, I would not recommend it to my friends nor to my enemies (if I had any)."
1,"In schools, really?","I cant believe that they use this book in schools. I also cant understand why it's such an ""amazing classic"". I continued reading this book because I kept hoping for some sort of turn around. I was hoping something would happen that would redeem the whole book, didn't happen. I'm sorry that I even finished the book."
1,Odd!,"First of all, i really give this book 0 stars, but that option wasn't available. I thought this book was the most retarded book I have ever and will ever read. Most of all, the sex scenes could have been edited. The incest, rape, molestation, lesbianism, whoredom etc. were all perverted and disgusting! Also, the story was so choppy and rambling that it was pointless. Yes, I understand Celie was oppressed by Mr.____, but lesbianism is not the answer to her liberation. I think the book was poorly written and not well thought out. I'm sorry, but it takes a sick mind to think up stuff like this. I never would have read it if I had known what I was getting in to."
1,This book is awful!,"All the book is about is sex, sex, sex! Celie and her father, Celie and Mr. _____, Mr, _____ and Shug, Celie and Shug, and Celie by herself. It's revolting! Why do they let this book be read in school, yet they won't show movies or other books b/c of their sexual content. It's a joke! The whole plot of the story stinks! It's been way overused my society. And people can say all they want about me only looking at the outside, and not the in-depth reading of the book, but they're wrong! I understood what the book was trying to say, but it could've been said without the sex. Even without the sex, though, the book is awful. It's about nothing at all, really. They say that it's about a black woman's struggle, but that's not true. It's about how a black woman fell in love with her husband's lover, who was also a black woman."
2,Offended and Disappointed,"I am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of Black men in this book and in the movie. The work offers NO BALANCE whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face. One Black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel. It is no wonder Spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves. The castration of the Black male has always been their main attraction, apparently Oprah's as well."
3,This book is revealing and too graphic for teens.,"While I found this story warm and sensitive, I also believe it is too detailed for young adults. Teenagers have a hard enough time trying to avoid sexual fantasies without reading the graphic situations presented in this book that can only cause more mental images of sexual situations that are improper, some illegal, and certainly far from encouraging abstinence. Adults, read this book and learn from it; teens, this book presents unhealthy relationships that you should avoid."
1,Who has the right to hurt another,There was too much incest and beatings and it took time to read the dialect to get the meaning out of the book. I am not sure what the plot was. It was a hard read for me and I wouldn't recommend it.
5,As Close to the Movie as you can get.,"Once in a while you find a movie that closely follows the book. It is rare, but it does happen. This is one of those times. The book was great. It talks about a young girls life and hardships and her relationship with God through letters to him."
3,touching with a taste of boredom,this book took a while to get into but once in I actually got quite into the book. The middle of the book got slightly slow but got back into the story at the end. It is however quite touching and you can sympathise with celie and all the traumas and heart brake she experiences.
5,A Wonderful Surprise,"I read this book as part of my quest to become a more well-rounded reader. To be honest, I didn't expect to relate to the characters at all, but I did. They were wonderful. I especially enjoyed Celie's journey toward love and I was really happy when she found it. It has been awhile since I have read about a character who has evolved throughout a book in such a profound way. This was my first Alice Walker book, but it won't be my last. Wonderful!"
4,THE COLOR PURPLE,"All in all, I liked this story. Although I didn't really relate much to the characters in the story, I enjoyed reading it. There were very few parts that I just absolutely dreaded reading. At times, it seemed some what boring, but nothing really made me want to just throw the book down and not want to read it. For the most part, it was very interesting, and fun to read. I think the reason it was so easy to get into, was because it was in a part of time that we haven't ever experienced. In those days, women were nothing, and men ruled everything, and blacks were treated like they were a lesser person then the whites were, whereas now, everyone is treated equal. I think by this generation not going through that, made it was interesting to read and try to understand what they were going through."
5,THE COLOR PURPLE,"Alice Walker's The Color Purple is an extremely inspirational book on the life of a black woman who survives a life which is almost unimaginable. Celie took on things in her life such as: raising a family, and looking after her younger sister along with protecting her when most children now days are still discussing what last nights 90210 episode was about. To understand Celie you must first understand that she has love for only two people which are here sister Nettie and Shug. Then you may be able to overlook the details of her homosexual life and realize that no man has ever showed her gratitude for what she did for them, or the respect that she had earned. The Color Purple was a truly remarkable book that should be taught and discussed in american classrooms more often than not. I highly enjoyed it."
4,rewiev on 'The Color Purple',"After I read this book by Alice Walker, I felt really sorry for Celie. The novel has such an emotional effect on me, that I finally thought I also lived beside Celie in course of the book. At the beginning it seemed to me, that Celie didn't have the chance to get out of her situation. But when she got to know Shug Avery, she finally left the suppression by Mr. and became a self-confident woman. In my opinion, Alice Walker gave very good detailed descriptions, which made it possible to others to feel like Celie thought."
3,"A view on ""The Color Purple""","In my opinion the topic of this novel is very interesting. You have an insight in the life of black people, especially black women. They had to do everything for their husbands and if they did not do what say wanted they were beaten by them. This situation is shown very well in the book ""The Color Purple"". But I think on some pages the content of the book is very uninteresting, e.g. when Mr._' father comes to visit his son or something like this. I would recomment to everybody to watch the film to the novel because it is made very well by Steven Spielberg with the actors Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg and some others."
5,This was the most amasing book i ever read!!!!!,"I found this book to be one of those books you find yourself to be constanly looking back to. this book kept me interested from page 1. I am not someone who likes to read that much... well I do, but I have trouble finding the right thing to read. this book I guess just did it for me. Celie was so aware of life and so innocent to it all at the same time. I think how she loved GOD so much made the story very interesting. You don't find that much these days with characters truly trusting GOD so much and how celie talked to GOD made me gain so much faith in the world and it made me regain faith in GOD. It helped me realize that there are turly people out there who do most completly believe in GOD... still even after what they have been through. I found this book to be one of the best books that i have ever read. It really captured me until the end where I then read it over. I thank Alice Walker for writting it, because it really needed to be written."
3,The Color Purple,I had to read the book in the English-lessons and it was hard for me to understand the black-english-slang because I am a German student.The story is quite interesting also it seems to me a little bit unbelievable.
2,The thought of a High School student on The Color Purple,Well The Color Purple is a well writen book if you want to get close to the reality of a African American poorly educated in the early 1900's. Although I was a book based on turn arounds and troubling plots. You never know really what Mr. blank she is talking about at any time. In a whole people got married then divorced it did ofcourse bring a ton of insight of different cultures and how they acted. I do like the journal writing between the sisters but you also get lost in how old or new the letters are since a certain person hid them. In a whole I honestly don't know if I should recommend this book or not it has it's goods and bads
2,Summer Reading,I didn't really enjoy this book. It was probably due to the sexually abusive references. I just found it to be a very disturbing book that I probably wouldn't read again.
1,Not Very Good....,"I can understand how some people might find this book good but to me it was just plain confusing. There are too many characters and it is very hard to keep track of who she is talking about and who she's talking too. Plus, you don't know weither she is saying something or thinking something because there is no quotations used (at least that was the case in the version of the book that I have) to tell the difference between thoughts and dialogue."
1,Color Purple book,"I really wish in one of the reviews that someone would have said something about the ""F"" bomb that was repeated and repeated. I guess I was just not expecting that in this book. I was told to watch the movie and most of the time the book is better. This one is not. I was very disappointed in this book."
3,The Color Purple,"I personally enjoyed this story. it was very heartwarming, and really touched me. Although i didnt relate much to the story, i understood exactly where the author was coming from. Many people have this stereotype about men being stronger then women. Well, this story goes to showthat a woman can overcome herself, and the stereotype, and to stand up to the ""stronger"" man. This story gives women a great name, adn goes to show how strong we really are. i prasie Alice Walker for everything she has done in her writings."
2,The Color purple isnt so pretty,"The color purple by alice walker is a fairly famous book. Yet i just finished the book and dont seem to understand. The book is about two sisters, separated when they were 14. One sister moves to Africa and the other stays in the states. The book is written through letters to God and between to sisters. I personally dont like the way the story is written. I think that these letters draw the book out far too long. Also i thought the book on a whole was not very intersting."
4,Moving and passionate,"It is hard not to be stirred by this book, which has quite understandably become a classic of American literature.Recounting the story of a black girl's hardships in the American world of prejudice, Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"" presentings a moving story of love, hurt, trial, and growth. From the most simple of perspectives --that of a girl's journal-- it presents a masterful look at the philosophy, mentality, and psychology of an age.""The Color Purple"" has become a classic of so-called 'Black Literature,' as well as a greatly honoured book within the feminist movement. Whether you are a member of either or not, this book is one you should want to read."
5,Searching for,"Alice Walker's famous epistolary novel, and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, is a pulsating song of love. Celie is poor, black, and a woman in a time when any one of these would be enough to shatter one's spirit. Her children, born from incest, are taken from her, and later she's married off to a harsh man. She loses her beloved sister, and shuts herself down from life. Years go by and it's her husband's mistress Shug Avery who injects the fire of life into Celie, awakening her to the beauty of the world and of love, and ultimately leading her back to her lost sister. ""The Color Purple"" is an inspirational meditation on the nature of God, the mysteries of love, and the range of human frailties. The book is also #41 of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels."
4,important and interesting novel,"I think it is a very wonderful novel concerning the role of blacks and women. you learn something about this important topic and you really can feel the emotions of the actors. It is written in a very emotional way. After reading, you are thinking about the situation of Celie and you are trying to put yourself in the position of Celie. Besides, the relationship between Celie and Shug Avery is very exciting because Shug is the only one who gives her the feeling to be someone. And that helps her to stand the situation. To sum up, I think it was very interesting to read the color purple."
4,My opinion,"The novel is a very great and serious book. I guess both the occuration of woman and the occuration of black people is showed well by Alice Walker. It seems to be realistic also because of the wrong language which is used there. I'm of the opinion that the subject of the exploitation of humen is demonstrated very well. There is a good choice of different characters who present the different thoughts and opinions which have been typical in former times. E.g. Sofia demonstrates a strong character, in contrast to Celie, which is the weak one. In conclusion the novel is very great and very meaningful for human rights."
3,The Colour Purple,"This is my second read of this book. It was a good read, not as riviting second time around. I found the story to be reflective & sad."
5,The Color Purple,"I enjoyed reading this book. I also enjoyed the movie. I do,however,think the movie would have been even better by staying closer to the book. Why does Hollywood think changing events in the story make a movie better. I think I will just stop watching movies."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"The problem with reading a book like the Color Purple right after you read The Yellow Crocus is that everything pales in comparison. I just could not get into this book the way I had hoped. I felt no connection to any of the characters, no emotional draw at all. The entire book left me flat compared to The Yellow Crocus which had a similar story line and had me enthralled from the first word.Maybe if I had read The Color Purple first, my review would have been different."
5,Does anyone know where I can get the playscript of the musical?,"The Color Purple is a riveting book, half about Celie's life and the other half is about Nettie's life, which part was completely left out of the movie. So if you've only seen the movie, you must read the book, as Nettie's life in Africa is completely interesting and the opposite of Celie's life in America.The musical had a short run, but was very funny, and I'd love to get my hands on a copy of the Broadway musical script, if anyone knows where I can buy that. I wish Amazon would sell it! Please?Read the book, it's one of the best books you'll ever read. The cover of this book is the same illustration that was used for the musical."
3,color purple,It really helped that I saw the movie before reading the book. I enjoyed the book. However their are parts of the book that I felt should not have been in the book. I had to skip the chapters where Nellie wrote to Celie. Those chapters just lacked my attention and bored me. I wondered about the storyline between Shug and Celie. In the end were they lesbian lovers or was that my misunderstanding. I really enjoyed the end that she left Mr.
4,Lovely Reading,This story is a captivating and wonderful tale of a family torn apart by abuse. It's lovely but may not be suitable for younger audiences because of some sexual content. I feel in love with this book once I got to the end. I wont spoil it but I greatly recommend it.
5,It is an amazing novel,It makes people realize the many things we take for granted. It is very realistic and shares with us the hardships they had to endure.
5,This is a wonderful book that I have ever read.,"I can not stop of reading ""The Color Purple."" This is a wonderful book that I have ever read. She, the main character, had her father's babies. She is her children's mother and sister. What kind of life does she have? Could you imagine"
4,Color Purple - Award Winning for a Reason,"There's a reason The Color Purple won a Pulitzer Prize. The story of Celie, a poor black girl whose abusive father sells her into a marriage little better than slavery, is both heart-wrenching and, in the end, uplifting, as Celie learns to stand up for herself and her dreams.The black dialect the book is written in was a little distracting to me at first, but the power of the story quickly won out. And the structure of the novel, told through Celie's letters to God, brings you close to the hearts of the characters - many of which are women whose strength, humor and support for one another through the toughest of times will make you laugh and cry."
5,Scented,"No over powering scent and no excess when it is put on, just leaves skin feeling soft and smooth"
5,Final Chapter,From the time I picked up the book and read the first two pages I was hooked. TW Miller has the ability to capture the reader's attention and keep him interested throughout the pages of his book. I look forward to re-reading it again soon.
5,Touching...,"We were given a World War II book report in English. I chose this book over Anne Frank. The way Nelly Toll told her story, it made you feel as if you were there, hiding in a small room, waiting for the Gestapo to leave, and praying that they don't find you. Even though her family was hunted by the German army, the Nazis, she continued to read, and write, and paint. Though the story has a sweet, and happy ending, sadness does lurk behind it. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Investment Basics for Women: The Essential Guide to Taking Charge of Your Money,"I purchased several books pertaining to investing. Of the 5, this book was the clearest, most informative. It told me exactly what I needed to know. Now, I understand what my financial advisor is talking about and feel like I can take charge of my money. I recommend everyone who is investing or thinking about investing (gender has nothing to do with it) read this book. If you have recently had to assume control of an aging parents finances and they have investments, this will get you going quicker than the others I purchased."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Amazing documentary. She is such an inspirational icon, never gives up or backs down... Its just amazing to see how she rarely gets discouraged.The Documentary is well done. Keeps the audience engaged every minute of the film."
3,Not at all what I EXPECTED!!,"Joan Rivers: A Piece of WorkI am a big Joan Rivers fan, I saw her over the summer and she was great!! I was very disappointed with ""A Piece of Work"". It was very boring, it was merely a documentary. I was watching with a friend who made me shut it off as she was getting so bored. Since I am a fan I did watch the whole thing and fell asleep. Also, it is already on TV so why by the DVD, I am trying to re-sell mine. Definitely, not her greatest piece of work!!"
2,Disappointed,"I have heard Joan for years and know that she slings curse words around, but I was shocked and disappointed in her that she has such a vulgar mouth. You can be a comedian but don't have to be so filthy, especially coming from a 75 year old woman. The video was interesting but I found that I liked her less, and didn't realize how obsessed she is over money and living a life of grandeur. Too bad."
2,joan rivers a piece of work,"I think I might have enjoyed this more if i had not just seen My life on the pink carpet. Not really what i was expecting from Joan Rivers..thought there would be more of her act and less daily mundain things...However I remain a fan of hers..totally enjoy her when she is ""on"" I probably recommend renting rather than buying."
1,Doesn't Rate One star.,"I was so looking forward to viewing this work. I was very disappointed. From the beginning it was full of ""F"" word that was disgusting. She was whining about not working to the point of boring. In the past I have enjoyed her Red Carpet commentary and expected much more from this tape. Granny"
3,Didn't reveal very much.,"If you enjoy her stand up, you should enjoy this. There isn't much substance to it. You won't learn any deep dark secrets about Joan from it. It's kind of like her reality show if you ever had a chance to watch that."
2,Ok......but....,"Didn't realize that this was a DVD. I enjoy her written work, but the DVD tends to be a bit raw for some tastes in a room...Gave it to some others who might enjoy, but this was to be a gift for someone who might have found it offensive. I only realized it was a DVD after I purchased it, but the other Rivers books were enjoyed."
3,Unusual Rendition of Schumann,"Klemperer plays these at a very slow pace. Very slow. The first disc of Sy 1 & 2 takes 76 min while Szell & the Cleveland do the same two in 66 min. & Zinman & the Tonhalle take 65 min. The orchestra is first rate - great sound. At this glacial pace you hear things you may not have heard from other recordings. Also, the pace is so slow that these symphonies sound almost completely different from other recordings. If you're familiar with Szell, Levine, Gardiner et al you'll need alot of patience listening to this recording. If you're looking for a completely different take on these symphonies this set may be for you. But if you're looking for only one or two outstanding sets of the Schumann symphonies, this is not the set to buy."
2,needs updating.,"I bought this book after having a good experience with the Lonely Planet Japan 1999. The Euro Shoesting book was evidently written on a shoestring. The Scandinavian section is lame at best. driving in Sweden, beware that there ARE photo speeding ticket systems in use. Breathalize exams administered at every traffic pullover. Sweden=.01 Norway=.02 Finland=.5 (MUCH more lenient) The book stated otherwise. Sort of a glaring error in the book. If you are going to the main large cities and the overrun touristy spots and you plan to hit them ALL, this is your book. Otherwise the book is cumbersome and far less informative as well as less accurate than the Let's Go equivalent offering. The is a severe shortage of useful maps as well."
3,Solid but undercooked.,"Lonely Planet is a great guidebook series, but their true worth shines only in their individual country guides, not in this massive tome. Sure it's got all of Europe in here, but Europe is a BIG place. If you only mean to go to major cities, this will be a great book to have, and the maps are well worth it. Spend 5 minutes off the beaten track and you'll need to do something else. I know where every English language bookstore is in every city in Europe now. I would find them and do additional reseach.The basic problem with this book is that editorial concerns triumphed over real meaty information. I ended up buying :P Hungary for my time in that wonderful country, because this book skimped on any real information outside Budapest.Trust me, if you're going rural than getting the individual guides is well worth it."
3,Let's Go is better,"I found this guidebook really unhelpful as far as prioritizing what to see and do. Rather than helping a traveler sift through what's worthwhile, every place it lists sounds like a brochure advertisement. Part of the problem is the density of the book, attempting to cover forty countries in one volume, so its listings of hostels, for example, are fairly short and uninformative. As for its being on a 'shoestring,' I found a the prices A LOT better in Let's Go Western Europe, which also prioritized things, pointing less-informed reader (me) in the direction of what would be worth his time (i.e. which hostels are better than others)."
2,"Good Quotes, But I Wasn't Looking for a Quote Book","If you're looking for a Quote book, you might like this, but I wasn't and therefore I was disappointed. Having purchased other books by this author such as ""1,2,5"" I thought this would be along those same lines, but it turned out to be a little book of quotes. And by little I mean the book is about 5 X 5 "" (approximately) and its just pages of quotes. I wasn't impressed by the quotes, as most are recognizable, but if you want inspiration for Face Book posts, you'll find it here. However if you're looking for a meatier book, that's interactive, well presented and reflective and inspirational, try one of his other books such as what I call the Number Series, ""1"", ""2"", ""5""."
4,Your Happy Baby,"This book wasn't exatly what I was expecting, but is very informative for a beginner with yoga, massage, and aromatherapy!"
2,Great Book,"I ordered this book and am pleased with the contents. They have many, many projects for young and old alike."
4,Good but misleading,"I was a bit confused by the title. I was looking for some standard blues grooves and fills. Instead I found 6 drum transcriptions: ""Look at Little Sister"", ""Born Under a Bad Sign"", La Grange"", ""Bad To The Bone"", ""(Call It) Stormy Monday"", and ""Hideaway"". The transcriptions seem pretty accurate."
4,The title doesn't do the book justice,"The Children Star turned out to be surprisingly engaging. It seems to straddle the target reader market of teenagers and adults. I liked the concepts presented concerning biology, but wish some of the other characters had more detail and development. The Elysium world that Joan Slonczewski created has interested me enough to look at other books from her."
1,Don't do it,"Only watched about 5 minutes, but had to stop because of the extremely poor production values and the lack of any coherent instruction. Too bad."
4,"This is a must have for any YJ owner, good quality","This is a duel set of detailed wiring schematics,and troubleshooting manual for the 1987 and 1988 jeep yj. Pages are clear however these are scanned copies of the original manual and not a re-print, some of the pages are cut off at the top where the title of the schematic is, making it more difficult to make out. This manual comes as an unbound set of 17in x 11in sheets so make sure you have a binder ready to for it."
4,Cool set,"My son picked this set out for Christmas and he loves it. It looks just like the picture. Not extremely rugged, but it will last if taken care of and used with some care."
3,Kids Costume,I bought this costume for my 4 year old. It is very cute but it tore the first time we were putting it on him.
1,"Great Delivery, cd was defective.","This was a gift, and I was embarassed that it did not play correctly even though there were no defects on the disc or package. It did however, arrive on time."
5,Great size for my kayak,"I fish from my kayak and this gaff works great! It's light, floats and I got the treble hook version. I use it like a third hand at times where I need to reach out and risk tipping the kayak. I use it to retrieve lures and to grab other objects just out of reach from my seat."
4,how is this a method?,"The songs and studies are fair, but I'm not sure how this is a method. It's not like it systematically teaches you anything bluegrass music or how to improvise it.Be warned that the book assumes you know quite a lot about the mandolin already: the learning curve is quite steep. A book for intermediate players."
1,Don't Bother!,"I bought and read ""The Ultimate Question"" because, as a marketing professional, I had heard a great deal of hype about Reichheld's Net Promoter Score. Having now read the book, I can say confidently that the hype is definitely not deserved. In fact, I found this book to be the worst kind of substance-less, hollow nonsense. Reichheld criticizes traditional measurement systems, and in some ways his criticisms are fair (trust me, I know). But his solution is truly mindless; should I or anyone really believe that all of my company's relationships with its diverse customer segments can be optimized by asking just one question? I know Reichheld has been big shot consultant for many years, but perhaps he needs to spend a little more time in an actual corporation dealing with actual customers before dispensing bad advice about customer relationship management."
4,Excellent read!,"This is a great book for anyone interested in understanding net promoter score and how to capture customer loyalty. In my opinion, succeeding long term can be achieved by listening to your customers, understanding and implementing strategies that drive ""good"" profits as opposed to ""bad"" profits."
1,Marketistics,"This book is worthy of a new term, Marketistics; i.e., the use of pseudo statistics for purely marketing purposes. This book is light weight (thin) and light in content, and most likely written by a ghost author. Evidence? The many discrepencies,inconsistencies and logic flaws in this book were ignored completely.But, worst of all, you realize that most of the 5 Star rankings for this book can be attributed to Buzzagent. Doesn't it seem ironic that someone espousing a book on the power of recommendation would enlist paid recommenders to promote his book? Isn't this exactly the kind of ""gaming"" behaviour that a real measurement system should discourage?One would hope that not many companies would compensate executives on an ""ultimate"" number that can be bought and paid for."
4,The Gold Standard for Customer Loyalty,"Bain consultant, Fred Reichheld, offers a fascinating and original take on customer loyalty. The Ultimate Question provides the framework by which companies can elevate beyond customer satisfaction to loyalty and profit by using a ""Net Promoter Score"".While much as been written about satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score is a lever that can be used to build and sustain competitive advantage. While the point was made in the first couple of chapters the NPS concept is both powerful and practical. This book is useful not only in terms of measuring loyalty but in shaping strategy based on customer feedback and insight."
1,Lazy and Innaccurate,"I bought this book because I bought into the hype that there could be an ultimate question. I was deeply disappointed in the very premise of the book once I read further. How can one question really drive growth, especially when that question is ""how like would you be to recommend us to a friend?"" How often do you recommend toilet paper, your pest control service, tampons, or a host of other products that you may use and love, but may not be really excited about sharing. Not to mention, the concept that everyone is a promoter or a detractor seems weak. And how can I turn my detractors into promoters or are they just a lost cause?This book left me with more questions than answers. It seems like the business guru version of the diet pill that promises to make you lose 100 pounds without changing what you eat or how much you exercise. Unfortunately for all of us, it isn't going to be that easy, either with dieting or driving growth."
2,Nothing new under the sun,"The question is right and very relevant, but I did not especially find the book helpful in answering the ""how-to-do""."
4,Good book.. Very interesting,Good book. I think it is important that the author comments that the ultimate question could be different depending on the industry or product/service. Worth the read!
5,Very insightful...,"NPS...Didn't know it and this book summary ""put the dots over the i's""Read it ant then you'll get the book for sure.Easy to read and comprehend.M3"
3,Loyalty is highly underrated in today's workforce,"So read this book and patronize the businesses mentioned. How many times have you gone somewhere only to realize you're just another number to them and if they mess up, they don't much care to fix it. This book shows how the businesses that are most profitable, will remain profitable, by listening to their customers. As a buzzagent, I highly recommend it. As a professional and someone who gets frustrated when companies don't value my opinion or money, I think it should be required reading."
1,Irritating,"If any of my employees are caught reading this tripe I fire them on the spot. This book is worthless and I think the reasoning behind why is superbly laid out by the other one-star reviews found here; I won't delve further except to say that only the dumbest, most gullible of employee would read this, and even if they were found to be my vice, I'd kick 'em out on the curb. On second thought, maybe I should give this book a five-star review, because it did allow me to easily select which members of my company were fat. And by that I mean uneeded, and certainly unwelcome."
5,better than I had expected,I have made 3 batches of ground beef jerky using the small tube in the jerky gun and the seasoning that came with the unit. It does great! I seperated my sticks about 1 inch apart and dried till rubbery (DONT over dry!!!! nasty!!!) Oh and use 95%+ lean ground beef or deer. Works out so much better. Love this thing!! Going to make huge batches for my fishing trip to Canada this summer.
4,somewhat happy..,"So far iv'e used it once, i used 2lbs of 93/7 ground beef, and i used the two teriyaki packets and the cures... they were way to salty the first piece i had i had to spit it out, but iv'e since had a few more pieces and they are still salty but not as bad, theese do not really taste anything like teriyaki imho... i could fit almost 2lbs in the dehydrator i used mainly the strip pieces but i did about a half tray of the smaller links.i think if i use the original jerky ones i might only use half the 'cure'I don't think i am going to buy any more seasoning packets from nesco, i may just make my own using recipes online."
2,"Super-cute, but flimsy!","This book is extremely cute. The idea of making a book about firetrucks into the shape of a firetruck (with real, moving wheels) is adorable. But the book is constructed flimsily. My son received this book as a gift when he was six months old, and played with it for about 20 minutes before the back cover came off the book. It appears to have been ""bound"" to the book with artist's tape. Within another week the book had split in half, so the wheeled sections were no longer joined. The truck was useless as anything but a chew-toy.If you have a child who is *very* delicate and careful with his or her books, then this is a good purchase. But for a regular kid that chews on board books and bangs them around, you won't get your money's worth out of this purchase."
2,Board Book,"Cute, but not made well at all. Will not last long. Already very flimsy binding and I haven't given it to my grandson yet - came that way!"
3,not very practical for me,good for what it is and the price. but the repetition has made my parrot go a little beserk.
5,Not useful,The vocals are said in a very dull way. It needs to be said in an interesting way for the bird to want to listen. It consequently has not been useful for my two birds.
4,Teach your bird to talk CD,"Really like this CD. You can choose to repeat whatever phrase you want your bird to say. Or just play the entire CD. Wish some of the phrases provided included the word ""parakeet"" since it includes others such as cockatiel or parrot."
2,crayons,My 2 year old has managed to break quite a few by twisting all the way out then breaking crayon. Once crayon is broken you can't fix. :(
1,Nice idea but they still break when dropped,"the twistable crayons are a nice idea. Bought them for my daughter, 28 months old. They break easily when they roll off the table They should have a stop molded into them to prevent them from rolling. Large pieces will come out of the plastic tube and can not be put back. so you must twist out more crayon. So they did not solve the problem of crayons breaking. I now realize they do not really make the claim that the crayons will not break."
3,Read the description carefully,"I was thrown off by the word Mini in the title and didn't check the description. I needed much smaller crayons to practice pincer grasp with my toddler and these are just regular size (pen size) crayons. It's great that they don't break like regular crayons but if you push down on paper strongly they do swivel back inside the holder. Overall, ok not great."
3,much better than regular crayons,I found these first at a craft store but paid 10 bucks for it while it found it on amazon for a little for $6. I love these as my 3 year old daughter started to color more recently and she the regular crayons keeps breaking on her. This has a pencil feel to it and it works out so much better.
2,Don't waste your money,"I was hoping these would help with my boys always breaking crayons, but these just break in a different way. Save your money and buy just regular crayons. Cheap plastic."
4,Great for clean crayon fun,My boys are aspiring artists - or at least they have fun coloring. I'd recommend this for parents looking for a way to avoid lots of broken crayons and scraps of the crayon wrappers all over the place. The only con is that I have two boys and for some reason they both seem to want to use the same color at the same time.
1,The Worst Camera I have ever had,I bought this camera for around a year. This camera gives me much trouble from the first second I used it. It consumes one expensive battery (around $6.20) per two 24 picture rolls of film. I believe Fujifilm should make better cameras than this one.
1,Not such a Hot Shot!!,"We have owned this camera since about a year ago. Really terrible pictures. We have put through about a dozen rolls of film on it, and although with time it has improved, the first images were really out of focus. It's like it needs to be broken in! Recently, the photos have been getting better, but it always produces pictures where the objects in the background are more in focus than the image in the centre of the photo that we orignally focussed on. I have taken many pictures in my life, but my old 110 camera did better than this!!!"
3,Good Stable Camera,"My dad got this camera for me, and i found it took really good pictures. They camera has many special functions so anyone could use it. I recommend it to everyone"
4,"More or less, a pretty good album.","Yeah, I would concur w/ the other reviewers. This album is pretty decent. A bit more proggy than their previous album. But on some occasions proggier is better. This album is more relaxed than the previous debut album. I guess that's the best way to describe it. But then again, by 1971 we WERE moving away from the rebellious sixties and into the more libertine seventies, so it is only natural that this would reflect in the music aswell.I guess the best question to ask about this album is if it is worth paying twenty dollars for only four tracks. I don't really know. If you can download it then do it if you know how. Though if you aren't able to download it I guess there are worse things one can throw twenty dollars away on. I won't deny the price is a bit steep, but... well... dem's de breaks! Deal with 'em.A nice piece of individualistic music. I take my hat off!"
4,Stan Tracey is Crazy!,"Ah, Stan Tracey! What a refreshing sound in the rhythm section. A pianist who doesn't believe in faceless comping or too much respect for the Visiting Jazz Giant. What did Ben Webster think of this piano playing? Did he appreciate the echoes of Duke and Monk? I hope so! Anyway, Tracey is what makes this disc a must - have. I'd like to believe it is he who prods Ben into the passionate playing here. Ben's standard rep - but with an important difference. Just great - get it!4 1/2 Stars - gotta save those 5's for the total Masterpieces! Sorry..."
4,An (almost) top flight Trovatore,"Because it's such a hammy melodrama, falling short of its stable-mates, Traviata and Rigoletto, in human itnerest, Il Trovatore is usually turned into a blatant exhibition of lung power. That's certainly true here when it comes to the Manrico of Corelli and the Count di Luna of Merrill. They shout to reach the bleachers. Far more artistic is Gabriella Tucci's vulnerable, humane Leonora, and yet the all-around effect of the whole set is positive. I can honestly say, as a great un-fan of Signor Corelli, that his virile, over-the-top bawling really works here.I won't turn in my RCA set with Leontyne Price under Mehta or my EMI set with Callas under Karajan, but the present performance is memorable in its blood-and-guts way. Sonics are good but not great; ditto the conducting of Schippers."
4,Cloe Rocks!,"This doll is totally awesome! I love the song she comes with too. I like the way they did the lips, it's original. I really, really, really like this Cloe doll!"
5,Cloe....,"Wow I saw this toy in on a computer and I was like whatever I don't really care for it(usually I love every Bratz I have 7, a limo and 4 things on my wishlist) then last night I saw my friends live in concert cloe... she was beautiful..she had light blondish whitish hair with pink streaks a cute live in concert outfit and cool accessories.The song rocks!! Now I really want to get her..Fun:ofcourse she's fun cloe is a great dollEducational: Although bratz dont teach much cloe does teach about the concert culture so thats my 3 educational starsdurable:same for all bratz durable but be careful with it...overall: cloe is the best.This is a great doll to get for escpiessaly if you love going to concerts and music!:D TTFN~~~Bratz #1 Fan~~~"
3,diffrent,"the bratz rock, but cloe who has two diffrent lipstic colors on is ugly. she has nice clothes and all but i prefere an original cloe"
4,great recipes,"Love the exposure to breads from different parts of the (Jewish) world. My only negative is that not every bread is illustrated (many are shown as line drawings, but some recipes have no illustration at all),and photos would have been a visual delight."
5,A gift of A Blessing of Bread,"This time I made a gift of this book, one that I bought for myself long ago, for a friend who wanted to enhance her baking skills. I was pleased that the author, Maggie Glezer, was so amenable to my request that she sign the book. This book has more than recipes. The author tells stories of bakers of Jewish goods from numerous cultures, including Middle Eastern breads. She includes traditional religious notations on baking challah, along with numerous variations, including one with sourdough starter and one she calls ""my challah."" I highly recommend this book."
5,Great for bread baking!,"This is a great bread baking cookbook! The recipies are very specific and make the process easy to follow. These are the right size for home baking and the one that I tried, so far, looks terrific and the challah appears as if it was professionally done. I don't see how you can go wrong. It is well worth the purchase price. I bake different style challah for the kiddush at my synagogue and receive rave reviews."
3,A film with a little of everything!,"I came across this from a blip on youtube only latter to find out that there was a full length film called Phantom Pain. As a lover of foreign films reading the subtitles was par of the course, no problem there. My reference that this film has a little bit of everything is related to sports as he is a biker, he has a complicated relation with his ex-wife, young daughter and the new wife's lover who is the main character best friend/employer-sponsor, the new love in his life, and on top of all that he looses his leg in an accident!I think I watched it one and half times to make sure I got all of the nuances. It was a good watch!"
3,Good latin jazz,"I bought this CD based on the reviews on the Amazon website. While it is good and I would play it at parties, it certainly isn't one that I would automatically grab for when I have a yearning for great latin jazz. It is; however, fun and sometimes provocative."
3,available locally,Just wanted to point out that this film is available at our local CVS Pharmacy (along with Kodak 400TX) for $5-6 per roll - if you want to give it a try it may be worth it to check there first.
5,Love this film.,I really enjoy this film and when taken to my trusted processor have had wonderful results.
2,good service poor product,"I wanted black and white film with C-41 processing. Poor contrast, poor tone, black not very black.But good vendor"
4,Good Music to work out too.,I love listening to this while I am doing a vigorous work out. It really gets you in the mood for giving it your all and really gets your heart pumping. This is one of their better works.
4,Really cool CD...if you like this you'lll love Fozzy,"If you like this Cd, you'll love the new Fozzy CD. Both haven't left my CD player since I bought them."
5,love it,My 16 year old loves these guys. keep making great music. s o m a n y w o r ds required for a review is silly
3,a good second album but...,"One-X was kinda what i expected, their first CD was much better, however im not saying that this album is bad but they could have done better. i kinda expected more from their new guitarist, the one thing they have always lacked is axeman ship. not that their new guitarist is bad but you could expect more then just a few well placed bar chords. never the less, its worth hearing if your a fan of the band."
4,Great Album,"A great album from a great artist. Unlike most CD's, I actually enjoy every song on here."
5,just as good as the first one,"if you liked thier first cd buy this one. if you dont have their first one buy them both, they are good from beginning to end"
4,actually better than I expected,I have their first cd but I just passed it off a part of the new generation of music. When I heard a few songs from the cd I was just amazed at how good it was overall. This CD is a breakthrough for these guys. A solid cool cd.
4,Better than the debut,"Just bought the album today and I'm on the second listening already. Favorite tracks include ""its all over"", ""riot"", and ""never too late"". The lyrics are simple but everyone can relate to them. Only complaint is that it's too short. Can't wait to see them on tour."
5,Although Different still rocks!!!,Ok i was fortunate to have this cd about 3 weeks ago and i still have not taken it out of my stereo and its the only thing my ipod is on at work!!! My favorite 2 songs are Pain and Riot but the cd as a whole is freakin sweet. The cd is a bit slower then their debut album but it showcases the band at it's high points including a solo in the opening track and the typical power chords that made the first cd so awesome. This cd explores more powerful lyrics that have a direct meaning to my life and im sure many others as well. this is a must have cd for anyone that loves this band and for people that have not heard to much of these guys get this cd and their debut and rock out!!!
5,5 star all the way!!,When I heard their hit song Animal I have become on the radio on my way home from work stuck in traffic I fell hard for it....then I got the album and that song was ok after I heard Never too late and Riot....those two climbed the charts for me in an instant and I knew right then and there in that very moment Three Days Grace's One X album was a purchase I was glad I made!!
3,"Pretty good, but not for everyone.","I would probably give this album a 3.5 out of five. It is a good CD overall, and include a mixture of slower and harder songs. No doubt fans of Three Days Grace will love it. But don't go out and but it for the song 'Animal I've Become'. If you arn't the kind of person who goes shopping for one song, then check out all the other songs first, as you may get disapointed. There is a fair amount of swearing in 'One X' for those who care. A varity of different swear words. For those wondering, f word, s word, d word all are used as far as I heard. There could be more.My final conclusion is that if you like the band and don't care about any swearing, get this album.If you like one song and don't know much about the band, I suggest checking out the other songs before you buy the CD."
1,poor cd,"If you are going to be in a rock band at least learn how to play the drums. I saw these guys the other day and i swear the drums is worse than a two year old. He couldn't even play ""I Hate Everything"" right. If you get at least one song right make sure that it is your hits. Besides the drumming the rest of the album sounds kinda whiny. Pain is the worst song i have heard yet."
1,mediocre at best.,"What's with all the 4 and 5 star ratings? I bought this album after reading all the great reviews and although its bearable, it's not mindblowing.This is standard rock fare of the Nickleback variety: No originality, average riffs, okay vocals but terrible asinine lyrics that are so obvious and cheesy it's laughable, (for example track 2 'this life is filled with hurt when happiness doesn't work?') This is bad 9th grade poetry, All the songs follow the same themes of loss, pain and despair and none of it rings true or connects on any emotional level.This is not a bad album but there's so much better music out there. If you are thinking of buying this album, I recommend you try before you buy or at least seek out albums by bands such as Dead Letter Circus, Butterfly Effect, Chevelle, Cog, Grinspoon, Karnivool, Shihad, 36 Crazyfists, A Perfect Circle etc. There is so much more original music out there."
1,???,"I hate bands that have a kickass debut cd and then suck after that. This CD sounded nothing like their first one. If you want a consistant band that puts out great album(s), go with Tool."
3,Seriously?,"Overall the product was great,but it was titled ""like new"" and it wasn't the CD case was broke so when I opened it the front would come off,and the CD itself had a huge ring around it. it should have been titled ""Good""."
2,Sophmore Slump,"After waiting a few years to hear their follow up album, i was disappointed to find that the driving anthems that made their first album so good were gone. Animal I have become is the closest song to their old album.....other songs like over and over are good but lack the intensity of home, just like u and other songs. If you like the new sound try breaking benjamins, their melodies are much better."
2,Not a very good CD at all...,"Animal I Have Become is the only worth while song on the whole CD (in my opinion, of course). TDG have become commercialized, the CD chocked full of weak radio friendly songs, as pressure from the label to sell music and make buck$ ultimately wins out. Glad I downloaded the torrent and didn't waste my money!"
4,More Mature Sound,"Three Days Grace's last album was your typical teenage raging at parents kind of thing. Don't get me wrong, that can be a lot of fun too, but I really love the way they have grown and matured their sound. I like just about all the songs on the album. 2 songs don't exactly move me but 10 out of 12, rating over 80% keeps it in my top 5 cd's I love to listen to. I really think if you've heard their first release from this (and you liked it) you'll enjoy the album."
5,Very Good CD,"I like every song. Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD."
4,One- X perfect follow-up to 2003's effort,"Three Days Grace is back with their sophomore album, One-X. There is not much I can say about this album except that it is amazing. The one weak point in my opinion is ""On My Own"". It doesn't seem to measure up to the rest of the album. Stong points include ""Pain"", ""Animal I Have Become"", ""Riot"", ""Get Out Alive"", and ""Time of Dying"". The band has chosen much of a softer sound here than on their debut, but even the ""kinda on the slow side"" ""One-X"" is a perfect closer to this amazing album. The cd deals with themes of depression (""Never Too Late"") and lost love (""Let It Die"" and ""Gone Forever""), but come back triumphantly in ""One-X"" with the closing words: ""We Stand Above The Crowd"". Amazing album. Can't wait to see what they come up with next."
3,A Resource for Teaching Bible Study,"Murray presents ten teaching methods for Bible study. Some of his ideas are quite good including theological Bible study, all senses Bible study, depth Bible study, and shared praxis Bible study. In these four methods, Murray helps us move past the written words to personalization and deeper understanding on both the part of student and teacher. However, in comparing all ten teaching methods Murray tends to be redundant, as there is a good deal of overlap in the ten methods. Additionally, some of the more current methods are not included in this book, which could be due in part to the fact that the material is somewhat dated, i.e. no material is presented which covers learning stations and/or cooperative learning groups. This book would be a good starting point for a novice Bible study teacher; but, for someone with any teaching experience, this book is not recommended."
3,Book is OK,I bought this book because it was being referenced in my Disciple I class. I did not find it to be as resourceful as I had hoped.
3,"nice tan,, but its a process","I have never used a self tanner before because I was afraid of being orange or streaky. This seemed easy because it is a spray. I am very pale, so I just wanted a little color. I had to do four coats over two days to get any color at all. I did light coats since I was worried about how it would look. But it is a very nice shade. my arms are naturally tan because of the sun, and the fake tan actually matches my arm tan perfectly. And it's not streaky because each layer is so light, which is good. I am happy with this product and might buy it again, although I might try other brands, since I haven't before. And it was only $8 at Target. But it is a little sticky when it dries, so there might be better out there."
1,TERRIABLE,"Got the spray for my daughter, turned her skin orange, I wouldent waist my money..Suggest lotion probable cover the skin better"
2,It's just ok.,Goes on great and even. Strong Dha smell though and a bit sticky. The color is subtle which would make it hard to screw up. Not the worst but not the best.
1,Horrible....,"Ok, so when i bought this i had high hopes for it. I brought it home and took a shower and exfloiated like you're supposed to. I sprayed it and waited a couple hours. There was absolutely no color change in my skin tone. I'm a natural redhead so i have the dreadful pasty white skin. I thought mabey if i sprayed it again i could see some color. Nope. I sprayed it a third time the next day and i still didn't notice a change in color. The smell gags you and it feels sticky on your skin. The only color that i got was on the bottom of my feet. I didn't even realize that i sprayed some on my bathroom floor and stepped on it so the next day my feet were bright orange. Eww.I had wasted about half the can on three applications. I just threw it away because that's where this product belongs. In the trash."
5,Benjamin Blozan - the next Mozart?,"This book is a fantastic learning tool for the beginning pianist, particularly because of Benjamin Blozan's wonderful compositions. They're not just great pedagogically, but they're actually lovely works, and exciting to play!"
2,Tag Heuer Link midsize,"Great watch, but with an imperfection...the bezel luminescent dot does not line up perfectly at the 12:00 position. Perhaps that is why it is discounted?"
4,More excellent electronic music,"Out of print, picked up this album in Toronto. If you are familiar with Four tet, or fridge, you've probably come to expect beautiful electronic arrangements and interesting drum programming. This album is more beautiful shimmering guitars, sitars and wind chimes with programmed live, yet real sounding breakbeats. The CD is worth the price simply for one or two tracks, but as a whole the CD is one of those must have CD's that could easily escape ever being heard unless re-released.This album sounds a little less electronic and a little less involved than some other four tet releases, but the songs are still very interesting, original and well produced.I gave it four instead of five because it is not mind blowing. However, it is of high quality, and is certainly considered an album to search for even at relatively high cost."
1,these are anne frank's stories,I was actually looking for a biography of anne frank for my daughter's biography assignment for a school project. Once we opened the book we realized it would not work for the assn.
2,I need to look closer,I got this for my granddaughter thinking I was buying the diary. I hope she enjoyed it. I will still try to find the one I wanted since I think it is important for her to know this history.
4,Anne Frank's Tales for the Secret Annex,Very informative supplement to read with the Diary of Anne Frank. Would recommend to anyone interested in Anne Frank and holocaust
1,it is not in order so do not buy it,terrible i think i wasted some money. It is not in order. It starts from 1year after they start annex life
4,amazing writing for such a young girl,Having never read The Diary of Anne Frank this was new. Although I ordered both Tales from the Secret Annex and the Diary of Anne Frank together I opted to read this one first. I find it pretty amazing the thoughts of a young girl written so well. Her stories are catching. A must read.
5,I read it every year,"Two years ago I volunteered to do tours of Rondout, Kingston for the Friends of Historic Kingston. I read the book before the first tour I gave in order to make sure I had enough background. Since the tours are offered on the last Saturday of the month from May through October I had time to learn more and more by consulting the books cited in the back of Steuding's book (five full pages) and the ""additional sources"" (eight more pages!). It is tough to stuff 400 years of history into a small book but Steuding has done a great job and a service to all of us who live and love the Rondout. The ""Album of Old Rondout"" in the center of the book with many of the Jack F. Matthews collection of old photographs is a huge bonus. Thank you Bob Steuding."
5,Rees Howells: Intercessor,I found this seller very good concerning the time of arrival and condition of the book.(Rees Howells: Intercessor)
2,The Complete Reference is FAR from Complete,"I ordered this book to assist with tasks like setting a global wallpaper for all users, and other specific items. All this book entails on that topic is how to change the wallpaper. It mentions manditory profiles, but does not instruct how to create or use them. In one small paragraph on the topic it tells you to see a previous section. That previous section just tells you to see the section that just refered you to the previous section. Ever hear of the term--endless loop?Overall, I'm very disapointed and I feel I wasted 40 bucks. Plus, I am now hesitant to purchase books without being able to browse them first."
2,McGraw Hill should stick to high school text books...,"This book should NOT be called a complete reference. It should be called INTRO to windows 2000 prof./server. It offers VERY brief discussions on some of the most important topics....IIS, configuring user profiles for access rights. Don't buy this book if you want something that will GUIDE you and EXPLAIN the parameters you are changing and configuring. Someone mentioned they used this book for the MCSE...i have no idea how they could have used this book and passed the test. Someone...PLEASE change the title from REFERENCE to INTRO, BRIEF, or something of this nature."
3,"Ok book, shipping took too long.","The book is fine, and in good condition.However, the shipping took way too long!"
2,"note from J. Franzen, one of the blurbists above","In the actual text, the word ""shocking"" was in scare quotes and meant exactly the opposite of what it seems to mean here."
5,John Deere Airplane,I bought this for my son for his birthday. He loves it. It goes nicely with his other John Deere toys.
2,Not good enough,I purchased this and wore it in 32 degree weather riding my commuter bicycle at 12 mph and froze my face off. This is super thin material and isnt hemmed or anything. I ended up cutting the sleeves off of an old pair of 3x thermal underwear and using that instead and that kept my face from freezing. I think this product is more suited to use in the summer as a dirt/dust shield. In short for cold weather protection it is junk.
3,Okay,"Works well to keep my hair contained but feels a bit too snug. Also not real warm when the cold wind blows, guess I need a polar fleece one for that."
3,white inner side,"I bought green tube but it appeared that inner side is WHITE!!! The seller should have mentioned this!!! It's hard to use white tube in outdoor situation.. besides,the quality seems to be average.."
2,3 Peace charger set for cingular 8125 not worth the money,"the charger does work but is cheaply made the retractable usb cable stoped retracting with in a few days, also the usb cable is very short works good in the car but as a viable home charger it is entirely to short don't plan on pluging it into a power strip and setting it on the desk and still be able to use it."
5,Gershwin at his best -- the Piano,"Beginning as a song plugger, the self-taught Gershwin became a master of the piano. What better way to indulge in this music than to paly it yourself! This collection contains piano arrangements of his greatest works, inclduing Rhapsodie in Blue for solo piano, and the overly ignored and infrequently heard Concerto in F. There are also two piano arrangements of orchestral peices, i.e. Cuban Overture. Be advised, the arrangements are difficult. Learning to play them will definitely take time. However, if you're into studying the works, or following along as you listen, then this is for you. Two copies will be necessary if you're going to perform them."
2,"Adds pizzaz to the looks of your engine, but little else","I do not recommend purchase of this K&N air filter wrap. I'm sorry I bought it now. It takes away from the intended purpose of having a cold air return filter system... it actually looses horsepower otherwise gained with the system. I took mine off the first week after I installed it. If all you want is to show off under the hood, then by all means get one. It certainly looks good and adds color under the hood. It fits perfect over your K&N cold air filter. But considering its high cost of about $30 for a sock that squeezes off about 15% of your engines airflow and robs you of HP and gas milage, then you are are better off without one."
1,What the Baha'i Faith isn't.,"At least that is what this book should have been titled. Rather than gather his information from sources both close and distant from the Baha'i faith's founder, Baha'u'llah, Mr. Miller elects to use only information he collected from the family of an estranged and angry brother of Baha'u'llah. A better book to read if you are really interested in what the Baha'i Faith is would be God Passes By written by Shoghi Effendi or The Revelation of Baha'u'llah by Adib Taherzadeh."
1,And the point is?,"Mr. Miller wants the reader to believe his book is a scholarly and unbiased perspective on the Baha'i Faith, but his purpose is to attack it. His facts are many times not exactly accurate and his opinions are vengeful. It is not a useful book for anyone who wants an objective view of the Baha'i Faith."
1,Lasted less than one year,"I bought this for my daughter's Dell Inspiron B130 on 9/12/08 and less than a year later, it is giving battery warning messages and won't hold a charge. I'm really annoyed and am shopping for a new battery for her, but there are very few reviews to guide my choice out of many replacement batteries. So I figured I better let people know about this one at least!"
4,Think outside the box!,"this book challenges you to do just that. It leads you from one emotion to another from the funny photo ""Cheating"" to the warm, and cozy ""Home"". From the poem ""Cuttings"" that is endearing and calming to ""Second Opinion"" that resonates with anguish, anger and regret. Viggo leaves you hungry and wanting to know more. If you are buying this book just because you are a Lord of the Rings/Aragorn fan, then you will be disappointed, this book has nothing to do with the actor and everything to do with the artist...the man. However, you won't learn much about Viggo, for like the Loch Ness monster he stays shrouded in mist, elusive, always just out of reach to the reader. If you keep an open mind, tho you may just learn something unexpected about yourself. P.S. the CD that comes with it is just icing on a very sweet cake."
5,"Author Summary, the issues of the heart","Deception is an issue of the heart. There are many factors that lead to deception, but pride and bitterness in heart are the two most important. This book gives an example of a whole congregation gone cultic. The lessons to be learned have universal application. Advice on how to avoid deception is an important part of the book. To date this book has been helpful to many."
3,Good but Uninspired,"In order for good music to be played well, it has to be loved. I can't speak for the love this orchestra and conductor have or do not have for these works, but the performance, while decent, never shows the listener what shines about d'Indy's works. In other words, I didn't hear the love. What I heard was a decent recording of works that are greater than how they sound.There are moments where the orchestra just doesn't blend well, and even a few times when they sounded out of tune to me. It's a shame, because this composer is lesser known than he should be. Because sometimes you can hear just how beautiful something ought to sound, you know that you'll have to continue your search for the right recording. That is my recommendation here."
2,Turgid,"I suppose the author must know his subject matter but he is a very poor writer. You have to fight your way through.This is the stuff that gives history a bad name. It can be done so much better, eg John Keay."
4,Good book,"Although this book is really long (1432 pages) it is a really good story. Parts of it are hard to understand, being that the book was written in old french, but the story as a whole isn't confusing. The guy who translated the book to english did leave a few sentences here and there in french which is really annoying."
3,Music Not the Concentration,"Not as good as other versions of the music. Having seen the play, I would buy older versions. All hype."
5,Les Miserables is a MUST READ,"Les Miserables in definitely in the top five books I've ever read. If you've seen the recent movie, don't let that stop you from reading the real thing. The movie does not do this book justice.This book is an absolutely riveting story of bitter convict transformed through an act of kindness into a most humble and generous man. However, Jean Valjean cannot, or more appropriately, society will not allow him to break free from his past. Just an absolutly fantastic book that will evoke strong emotion and possibly cause yourself to search your soul over societal questions and issues.If you've ever even thought just a little bit about reading this book - DO IT. Read the unabridged version. Don't let editors decide what to leave out. You can always skim the parts that don't interest you."
3,tortuous,"At over 700+ pages, it is really difficult to get through. I passed over a lot of chapters re Paris sewers, Napoleon's war, etc. Victor Hugo is a mighty writer but he got too verbose."
1,About the packaging,This review has little to do with the book itself but more to do with how the product was received. The package was delivered to me in a box that looked as if it had been through a traffic accident and simply left shoved in the mailbox. Needless to say there is considerable damage to the book; truly disappointed with amazon to the point of discontinuing use if the situation is not rectified in some way.
3,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION,Les Miserables is one of the most amazing stories ever written. The abridged version seems to ruin many aspects of the story for me. Buy the unabridged Singet Classic one (the book with the familiar les mis logo on it). It is worth all 1463 pages to read. Taking 1000 pages out of a book simply does not work
4,I would not have it one word shorter!,"Yes, it is a very long novel, but every word counts. This is not the sort of book to read if you just want to know what happens next - it is a lovely, long, engrossing read. For example, the author lingers on the kind M. Bienvenu for chapters and chapters ... but by the end of it, there is no man so good, so kind, so well-regarded. We have the EXPERIENCE of a life of good (actually, think of it, it is probably too short!) not just ""he was a good man"" in two paragraphs. I am actually reading the novel to someone, and we have just finished Bienvenu's section, and enjoyed it very much.A very involved plot, many of the characters who would be familiar to the musical-going audience.It could be that the almost simplistic symbolism of the characters (ie. Beinvenu=compasionately good, Javert=inflexibly moral, Valjean=redeemed, Fantain=innocence lost, Cossette=love triumphant) is what makes such a complex story easily rendered on the stage."
3,I READ THE WRONG VERSION,"FOR YEARS I HAVE WANTED TO READ THE ENTIRE LONG VERSION, BUT FELT I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO GET INTO IT. I SETTLED FOR THE ABBRIDGED VERSION AND ALTHOUGH I LIKED IT, I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I FELT THAT THERE WERE THINGS MISSING AND AT TIMES I WAS CONFUSED. THE VERSION I READ WAS ONLY 400 PAGES AND THEREFORE LEFT OUT A MAJORITY OF THE DETAIL. THE STORY REMAINS A CLASSIC."
1,Abridged = Major Plot Points Deleted!,"I picked up this abridged version because the original is very lengthy. At about 50 pages in, something strange happened. One chapter ended with Fantine getting a job at the factory, and the next chapter began with her on her deathbed! I pulled out the full version and noticed they cut 6 chapters from the original book and in so doing, completely eliminated her story, which changes the entire course of the main character's life! This is far from a ""sensitive abridgment"" as the cover claims!"
5,Timeless,"Victor Hugo's character is timeless.Where this book surpasses its boundaries is by exploring the weaknesses of a character, whose strength is its main selling point. The soul of this book lies in exposing the barometer of your own conscience."
3,Different translation than one advertised,"The book ADVERTISED was ""a stunning new edition translated by prizewinner Christine Donougher and with cover art by Coralie Bickford-Smith"". The book I RECIEVED was a reprint of the Norman Denny 1976 translation in a new edition with really nice (new) cover art."
2,Horibble Version!,"I actually purchased the Barnes and Noble Classic Version which had almost 900 pages and me being only 14 said, ""Ok, I'll buy that one,"" because even though it was abridged it couldn't possibly be that abridged. But, when I got my package today, THIS one came and I was shocked to only see 400 pages and I was very dissapointed. Immediately i turned to the front pages and seen that the chapters were named differently it was large print in a way, and it left out the whole part about the Bishop of Digne, which is just repulsive, and i couldn't believe they did that. So beware because this one really chops up Victor Hugo's work, and i wouldn't even waste your time with this one!"
3,"Good, but...","A very good abridgment, but it cuts out much of Hugo's work. As an example it removes the very long and potentially dull narration of the Battle of Waterloo which is a plus for those looking to follow Jean Valjean and his quest for redemption. But it also removes the heartwarming tale of how Jean Valjean rescues Cosette. This offers a nice short read with the core material covered in the full work."
5,Les Mis...,Great translation! I appreciate that the translator aimed to keep the poetic flow of the original writer - Victor Hugo. It was well worth the money.
2,too long,It is too detailed. It could be easier to read without all the details as the story itself is interesting.
4,Great hardcover book Les Miserables,The book is very long and my wife tells me that it is Great book. Like the hardcover. Lots of detail you would not see in the play or movies.
4,Wonderful novel - but Kindle edition has typos,"The kindle edition has quite a few typos in it (e.g., the word ""die"" usually appears as ""the""), which is aggravating because I assumed I was buying a certain quality given this is a Penguin Classics edition. The novel itself and the translation is excellent, but given the price I'm disappointed in the quality."
3,Not as good as unabridged,"The first time I read Les Miserables it was the unabridged version and that was so full of story and historical facts that built up the setting and the characters. I thought it would be a little too much though for my 12 year old to read all of the history of the rise and fall of Napoleon and how he affected the political climate of the times so I chose the abridged version. Unfortunately, I found myself having to orally relate the back story of many important characters that set up the horrible and amazing consequences and results of actions and relationships. What an amazing book the unabridged Les Mis was, but this one was choppy to me. It just left out too much."
1,Why do they do this? WHY?!?,"No one has a way with words quite like Victor Hugo. He has a completely unique way of setting up a situation and an exceptional knack for coming up with complex, yet enjoyable plots. Les Miserables, his most ambitious work, is arguably one of the greatest literary accomplishments ever and I truly loved it.This, however, would be lost to any of the readers to this edition, b/c they are not truly reading Hugo's great work, they are reading a version that has been nipped and tucked to fit into the publishers' idea of a good book; that is, one short enough to keep today's average, short-attention-spanned readers from becoming bored. In reading this book, you are admitting to the publisher that you are too lazy and dumb to grasp real literature or appreciate beautiful use of language when you see it. If you want to read a great book, read the original, don't read this censored rubbish."
3,Book intro says it all,The stage play and recent movie adaptation of the play are fabulous. My wife and I have yet been to either the theater or the movie without hearing sobbing throughout.the book on the other hand is a very difficult read. Hugo drones on and on and on until a topic is overworked that you wonder if you can muster the focus to continue. I applaud the playwrights for their ability to find such a wonderful story within the 1200 plus pages of this book.This is my 3rd attempt to read the unabridged version. I think I will fail in this attempt as well. 60 pages and I am still reading about the bishop!!! My wife tells me the abridged version is a very good read.Good luck to all and congratulations to those that can finish!
3,"Beware, this is a very long book!","I saw the 2012 movie and was inspired to get the book for my Kindle. However, it was too long for me and I quit after Volume 1 (there are five volumes, 1,000 pages). Well written, but dark and gloomy."
3,Les Miserables,I guess you could classify me as an illiterate as I am having a rough time getting into the story. I don't read the classics much Bronte being my favorite. I will persevere though.
5,Truly essential reading for anyone. The best book ever!!,"I could never fully express what this book means to me. It is such a rich work full of so many characters that anyone can identify with. It is beautifully written in every way. The plot is very engrossing. The characters are intriguing and exciting. The whole book says a great deal about life and what we should or should not do with it. I hope that everyone that reads this will go out and read the book. You may at first be distressed at the extreme length of the book. However, you can read it a section at a time and then put it down for a while and pick it up in the middle later and fall right back into this world. Read the book. You will never experience something so wonderful in your life as a reader than this book!!"
5,Probably the best novel of all time!,"Never before have I shed a tear after reading a novel. Emotions grip you till the very end, and for a long time after that."
5,Engrossing Story!,"After I saw the movie, I wanted to read the book because you always get so much more insight into the characters. I spent a lot of time looking at the various reviews on Amazon. There are two translations that people would discuss - one by Wilbur and the other by Denny. One reviewer put the same passage side by side and the one by Denny was much more more readable for our time. I got the Kindle version which is light for a 1,200 page book and it was very inexpensive. I am only 12% through the book and I am enjoying every minute of it.. Hugo does tend to digress, but his digressions are worth reading. Some of the words I am unfamiliar with because they are either French or archaic. Having an online dictionary handy has been helpful. This is a great book. Take the time and enjoy!"
4,Genius!,"I loved this book! I saw the movie recently,which was obviously better because it's got Anne Hathaway in it and she's good, but not as good as Susan Boyle because she sounds like an angel from heaven!"
5,Long read but worth it,First Victor Hugo I have read...The story is involved and long but well worth the read. If you like the movie and the play you will know the characters and the expanded story reading this
4,"""Les Miserables"" review","This book starts off really slowbut once it gets into the story, I found it very interesting and a good read. There is a lot of ""philosophy"" in the book and a lot of points that make you stop and think. It is defininitly not for everyone. It is thought provoking and not for some one looking for a quick or easy read. A good word for this book might be ""heavy!"""
5,Fine little book,"This is a good little book to read. Take some time, sit down, and give it a read through. I think you will be happy that you did. You'll laugh, You'll cry, and if you're like me you'll take a lot of snack breaks. As far as books go this is up there."
5,Daughter's excited to read.,"This was my favorite in high school, now my daughter is excited to read. I chose based on reviews of translation, I am not a literature major. Wonderful saga!"
1,There must be a better abridged version.,"My great disappointment as well. I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter who loves the musical. I wanted to show her the magic behind the music but knew full well she would never attack the unabridged version. I brought this home and began thumbing through the table of contents--something I should have done in the store--No mention of Waterloo! That sparked my thorough review of the book. I was aghast. My first reading of Les Miserables was an abridged version, but it still contained all the major story points. This book is a gutted and dried fish."
4,My first Hugo and not my last.,"I've always enjoyed the essential plot of Les Miserables, having seen the musical, but have never read the book until now. It is beautifully written with luscious language. I would recommend this book to everyone. I only gave it four stars because in the unabridged version, Hugo goes off on tangents that are interesting, but go on a little long and don't really have much to do with the story. But, I did love the book. It was my first Hugo and it won't be my last."
3,too long a version of thius novel,"too lengthy a version. An older version I suspect. Descriptions are verbose, but original. Simply unable to fit comfortably into a busy life"
3,The reviews I read prior to purchase are true,"I have the completeed book including the chapters of run on information that are rather bring and mundane, I havre been busy and therefore not read ery far as of yet. I hope it will hold my interest until he brings more often"
1,not good format,this mp3 book les miserables is not what i thought it would be i was looking for an un abridged les miserables audio book this only woks on the computer its not as enjoyable compared to hearing it from the stereo which lets you lay comfortable on the bed hearing the bookthe seller did ship it very quickly i received it very fast
1,LES MISERABLES IS UTTERLY MISERABLE!!! :(,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I WASTED 15 HOURS READING THIS HEADACHE OF A BOOK, WAITING FOR IT TO GET BETTER, GUESS WHAT, I JUST TURNED THE 400TH PAGE AND I AM STILL WAITING!!!"
2,Please read the unabridged version...,"I just finished reading the original unabridged version of this book, in French, and believe me, I was moved. So when my wife and I wanted to get an abridged version for her to read in English, we bought this one. On skimming through the book, and maybe it's just us, but we found no trace of Fantine's story before she ended up in Jean Valjean's care, or of Jean Valjean's rescue of Cosette from the Thénardiers, which are both very moving parts. If those are missing, there are probably other very touching and important parts missing. We plan on taking our version back and getting the full version. It would be better to just skip past the sections that talk about the convent, the battle of Waterloo, the sewer system, etc., because they're wasy to skip, and the rest of the book will still be there. Honestly, Les Mis is probably the best book I've ever read, but it has to be purchased in it's full format to really be truly appreciated."
3,"5-star novel, 3-star abridgement","This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever read. I loved the musical and wanted the rest of the story. I wanted the unabridged version, but got this one as a gift. GREAT story--and well worth the read--but this abridgement is too severe in my view. I felt like too many chunks of the story were missing and left unexplained.I recently bought another abridged (but still 880 pages) version (actually the Barnes & Noble version) and that one is just about right. Whatever they cut, I didn't miss (and there were still a few segments I could have skipped over).So if you want to experience the real Les Miserables and see what all of the fuss is about, I would skip this version and get a less severe abridgement or, if you dare, an unabridged version."
4,Ok...,"It's a comfortable set...little bit lose but other than that the clarity is good, and it seems reliable so far."
2,"OK, but not terrific","Honegger, another major Modern figure who's largely been forgotten, wrote perhaps the finest cycle of French symphonies. The Second and Third get recorded relatively often, the first not so much. I bought this mainly for the First. The Second, for string orchestra, has an optional trumpet part in the last movement, not assigned here. That doesn't bother me as much as the level of playing. These, to be sure, aren't easy to play, but Plasson and his band are downright sloppy. Honegger requires rhythmic precision. Otherwise, his highly contrapuntal textures fly apart and sink into an aural smear. I'd stay away from this one."
4,This thing is great,"After using non-adjustable squares for years I tried this one out when I had to drywall a wall joining a vaulted ceiling (lots of angles). It worked very well and I now use it all the time for plywood, drywall, backer board etc."
4,Swanson's Chinese Import,"These Swanson adjustable squares are available in local brick-and-mortar stores and are fairly solidly made of thick aluminum with only a few mil of slop at the joint, equivalent to less than one degree. For the price I had hoped for an American-made tool with etched markings. This tool is Chinese-made with painted markings."
3,good book long time,The book took a long time to get shipped to me.I did receive it.It was in good condition.
5,Great Read,This book is a must read if you really want to know the Yankee Clipper. Entertaining read.
1,Awful,"Had to throw these out. Too much side effect. Aches, sleeplessness, stomach pain and no weight loss."
2,Fujifilm 400 speed 25,"I purchased the product above and I did receive the item on time. However, the film did not work proberly in my camera and have returned the item back as they requested. I have not heard from the company back yet so I am unable to give a positive review. I will be contacting the company and to find out what they have decided to do for me."
4,Good Product for the Price,"Good enough - no problems to speak of. I guess I would always prefer to lean ""American"" - made (KODAK Film)."
5,Works Great!,"My mother refuses to use a digital camera. She prefers her APS Canon Elph. With this film, pictures come out crisp and clear. No complaints. Highly recommended."
5,Make sure that your camera works with the film,"This film is not for use in 35mm cameras. It can only be used for 24mm cameras. The product description did not give you this important information.You have to watch who the seller is. Never buy a product from the seller who has a very strict return policy. For instance, Photoworld will not allow you to return this product if you bought it by mistake (if you read their return policy, almost nothing can be returned). Always buy things from Amazon or a reputable seller who has a decent return policy. Also, if you see that Amazon is the seller in the product list view, the seller may be switched to a different seller when you enter into the product page. You'll need double check the seller when you place the order."
1,Go For the Kodak,"You get what you pay for... In many places and stores the Fuji film is less exppensive than the Kodak. Spend the extra 2 dollars and buy the Kodak. I bought the Fuji film because it was on sale, the first roll that i shot was okay, except that my friend was using the exact same camera as me (Olympus) and he shot w./the Kodak 400 ISO and it was much sharper and much better quality than my shots. Then the second roll of the Fuji i put in jamed and i had to get my camera fixed for a cost of 20 dollars. The peeople at the repair shop said that the film was made improperly and that is why it got stuck in my camera. I will never buy Fuji film again, their developing process is also sub-par compared w/Kodak but i won't disuss that here. Save yourself the touble buy the Kodak."
1,OVERCHARGE OF FREIGHT COSTS,"THE PRODUCT FUJI FILM WAS O'K.MY COMPLAINT IS THE GROSS OVERCHARGE OF FREIGHT $1700 DOLLARS .HAVE CONTACTED UPS,THEY ADVISED FREIGT SHOULD HAVE BEEN $88 DOLLARS DOOR TO DOOR"
3,For fans.,"This EP eluded me for many years, but I lucked-out recently. Overall it's something good for the HOP fan who already has their three albums. We get two mixes of the rocking ""Legend"" which are good, and two mixes of a song I never cared for much ""Word Is Bond"". The big plus here for me is this mix of ""It Ain't A Crime"", mostly because of the Chili Peppers sample. In short this is not essential, but the fanatic should dig it."
5,great seafood,"fresh frozen, really large shrimp, that after de-shelling, etc. cooked up very tender and delicious and the best part, is that they are a product of the USA, which is important to me because the only frozen shrimp available where I live have been farm-raised in Thailand or China, neither country very famous for clean, un-polluted water or food hygiene."
3,Good,"These are tasty, but a lot of work to make. They also were a bit expensive. They're good, but I don't know that I'd buy it again."
1,Horrble,"They tasted awful! I followed the directions step by step, took about 30 minutes to make them. The final product was not worth the time it took to cook them. We won't be buying them again."
1,These products are terrible,"These Dixie Carb products are awful. They might be low carb but they are full of fat, hard to make and taste awful. See my review on the pecan sticky buns for the gory details. Don't bother!"
3,Semi-Deserving Obscurity,"Legendary U.K. producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven created this album for three American 'hippie chicks' who were visiting London in 1969. A couple dozen professional British session musicians (including Herbie Flowers) make the girls' amateurish singing and lyrics almost presentable, a cross betweenPermanent DamageandKip of the Serenes.The claim to fame for this album is that Stanley Kubrick heard it during the filming ofA Clockwork Orangeand had the girls re-record two songs, ""Overture to the Sun"" and ""I Want to Marry a Lighthouse Keeper,"" for his movie soundtrack. For years I wondered about the origin of those two anomalous non-Wendy Carlos tracks in the movie, never imagining they both came from the same album. Now I know."
5,Educaional for 8 year old,Great Christmas gift for my 8-year-old grandson. He also enjoys the prepared slides that I bought to go with it.
4,Great Album,thanks to whomever stated the artist and song title of maria's dancing debut in the club!!!!! i have seriously spent the longest time trying to figure out who it was.every song that opened a scene in code 46 never ceased to amaze me. free association is awesome. the soundtrack kind of reminded me of mogwai (and that's a plus). code 46 is booooooooooooooOOmmb. this movie came out before eternal sunshine...but i still love michel gondry yo...!
3,Stylish But Thin,"This is an exercise in tone and mood that doesn't really have enough bite or story to keep the viewer interested. It does have a 1980's ominous feeling that characters are flirting with a dark world they don't really understand, but lacks the energy and danger of ""Blue Velvet"" which must have heavily influenced it."
4,if you want to know...check out this paperback,"i own and have read a copy of this paperback. although i am not very interested in astrology orsorcery,i did like the book. the chapter i liked the most was about numerology. this book also has some black/whiteillustrations. some contents of the book are:astrology,the magic of the moon,numerology,palmistry,tarot cards,dominoes,graphology,dice divination,the asian zodiac,the casting of lots,candles,I CHING,spells,charms,incantations,and psychics. each chapter includes the history of,and a COMPLETE explanation/instruction(how to do).there is alot packed into this little paperback so,it has some interest to the novice or the curious."
3,For adults (mostly),Great quality gun with what seems to be made of steel! It requires an adult male to shoot it with one hand. My wife couldnt pull the trigger and she works with her strong hands daily. It's heavy due to the materials. Havent tried actually using caps though. I want to try to sell it.
5,Charge!,"With this great, sturdy pistol and holster set, every little Johnny Reb can help the South rise again!"
2,"Cute, but...","This is a cute little burpie, but not very absorbent. For the price, I expected it to be a little bigger and more absorbent. Recommend the baby jar burpies instead."
2,Great cast in a horrible movie,"This is your average kung fu movie with a mangled up story. Leung Kar Yan (Thundering Mantis) and Meng Fei (Kung Fu - The Punch of Death) are protecting a high government official. Trying to kill the official is Kam Kong (theMaster of the Flying Guillotine), Phillip Ko (Invincible Pole Fighter), and another guy. They are a funny trio. Phillip Ko is a Tibetan Lama, Kam Kong is a Mongolian, and the other guy is a Muslim. Helping them out is a masked man played by Yu Tien Lung (the villain fromSnake-Crane Secret). The legendary Lo Lieh also has a role and Yueh Hua has a small part.Basically the story involves traitors and a lot of assassination attempts. There is also a Russian army causing trouble.The fighting is only average which is kind of a shame with all these great stars on hand. There is plenty of action but it doesn't get good until the final fight. All of these actors have had much better performances.1.5/5Picture quality on the Videoasia DVD is decent."
4,Read this book but Stay Out of the Shower,"William Shoell's look at Psycho and its cinematic legacy sheds interesting insights on suspense filmmaking from 1960 to the mid 1980s. Shoell's take on the aftermath of Psycho is that American film making in the post Psycho era was able to become more graphic thanks in part to Psycho's overwhelming success at the box office. Shoell backs up his claim with analysis of multi-genre Hollywood films from the 60s on. Most notable are his criticism of the Hollywood western and television violence. Horror fans will be delighted to revisit the golden age of the stalk and slash film as Shoell highlights that era's top pictures. Shoell gives an organized, interesting, and carefully rendered account on 25 years of shock cinema. It is interesting, and informative reading."
3,Psycho stands alone,"An examination of the influence of ""Psycho"" on the next twenty five years of horror films, well illustrated with horrifying stills from movies such as: Friday the 13th, The Eil Dead, Night of the Living Dead and Psycho.In the end, none of the films compare favorably with Psycho which stands alone even when compared to it's sequels."
5,eary christmas,"Bought this along with some of Nox Arcana's other CD's as ""mood music"" for the trick or treaters on Halloween. IT was perfect and I highly recommend it for that purpose or just for general listening. It inspired my young son to write some of his own stuff with our keyboard. It isn't your standard Christmas cd, but it is better than I expected...."
3,Why is this Version Cut?,"One of the more frustrating things about ""remasters"" is that sometimes they are ""re-edits"". While this release gives us one more track in the pre-concerto performance (""Hush""), as well as the previously unreleased encore, the editors of this CD have cut more than 2 minutes from the third movement of the concerto!!While this cut was mainly from the lengthy drum solo, there was certainly enough room on the disc for the full version.The now out of print import CD has the complete version and sounds equally as good as the remaster.This ""remaster"" smacks of revisionist history. For shame!"
5,Comprehensive beginning text,"This text has several advantages over more recent beginning Greek textbooks. First, it was written to be used at either high-school or college level. Second, it was written before the ""Biblical Greek"" and ""Attic Greek"" divorce. If your primary goal is to read the Greek New Testament but you want to base that further study (using say Zerwick's Biblical Greek) on a broad basic study of classical Greek, this is the book for you. Unlike modern ""classical"" Greek texts, it is not ashamed of the gospel even though the emphasis is on attic greek. While there are numerous exercises, etc., the lack of a solutions/instructor's manual probably prevent this being a good self-study text unless one has already had some greek."
1,Naked Robbery,"Amazon is allowing some appalling 'bookseller' - I can think of other terms - to offer a paperback edition of this book, which has no special rarity value, for over $320. I've noticed that increasingly extortionate prices are being demanded by resellers on this site. Buyers beware."
2,MOONFLOWER CHILD,"MOONFLOWER CHILD IS ENTERTAINING WITH HUMOR, TRAGEDY, COMPASSION AND IS A FAST MOVING BOOK CONSUMED WITH ALL THE SITUATIONS THAT ARE IN STORE FOR CATHLEEN,""CATS"",TO CONQUER AROUND EVERY BEND. I WANTED TO KEEP READING ON AND ON AND HAVE IT NOT END.CATHLEEN, ""CATS"" IS THE GIRL IN A LOT OF US THAT WISHES THAT WE COULD HAVE HER PERSONALITY AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES. ""CATS"", IS A DETERMINED SURVIVOR OF HER TIMES. SHE'S NOT A WHINER LIKE MOST WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES, EXPLAINING TO EVERYONE WHY THE WORLD OWES HER A LIVING OR LIVING LIKE AN OSTRICH WITH HER HEAD BURIED INTO THE GROUND. SHE KEEPS MOVING FORWARD AND FINDS AN ENLIGHTEN HUMOR IN THE MOST UNHUMOROUS CIRCUMSTANCES.THE CLOSURE OF ""MOONFLOWER CHILD"" GIVES OUR HEARTS A PERSPECTIVE TO THE FEELINGS OF THINGS THAT HAS HAPPEN TO ""CATS"" AND THE HEARTWARMING OUTCOME."
1,Movie review,This is a movie that I really like and was looking forward to receiving.But toward the end it was poor quality and I had trouble with the picture and sound.
5,"Dollmaker, Caretaker","I have looked everywhere for this movie. It is my very favorite movie. You can't help but cry when you watch it. It shares the classic struggle that Gert has to care for her children without undermining her husbands need to support the family. Of all the movies I have ever seen (theater and TV), this is still by far my favorite. It reminds of the strength and love that all women have when it comes to their loved ones ;And no matter how tough times may be the creative sacrifices that they willingly endure."
4,background,I've desperatley looking for the track which is playing in the background all the time. I don't know the name of this classical song nor by whom it is. If anyone knows please send me the info to raf@gmx.net - Thanks!
2,COOLIO BUILDS THE ECSTACY FOR THE NEW GENERATION.,"DAVE TOP ONAMADE. LANGRUTSTRASSE 127. SWITZERLAND. Wow i doubted! am i sure this musician was coolio because i listened to his last release which is gangster's paradise now i can authomatically differenciate C U WHEN U GET THERE from gangster's paradise. this record was so nice, full of entertaiment and inshort it was interesting. THe MAIN POINTS WHY I LIKED THIS RECORD: How it was composed. Their mode of dressing. their english was nottoo hard to understand. The (RAP) and so on. i likke this music so much and i havethe feeling that i have to get one. Perherps i'm looking forward to his next release. WHAT A GREAT MUSICIAN."
1,A sad decline,"I was a great admirer of Ms. Boland's early poems, though what struck me as bold and innovative and fresh in that work has become (or so it seems to me) a sort of tired rhetorical posturing, and a sort of frumpy stylistic manner. Her early authority seems feigned now, and I personally find it hard to account for the flatness and airiness of the poems themselves. I should add that I say all this with a sinking heart, as I had very high hopes for her career."
2,Boland's Latest a Disappointment,"Eavan Boland has made a lasting contribution to modern poetry in English. Her earlier volumes, excluding The Lost Land, explored themes of domesticity, women's creativity, and Irish nationalism in language both lyrical and tough-minded. Her latest collection seems flat and uninspired, as if she is imitating herself. As if she is thinking too much about what she wants to say and not letting her own poetic voice lead the way. Could the problem be that she is now spending too much time in the U.S. as a tenured academic at Stanford? Whatever the cause, I hope she returns to her earlier passion and power."
3,"Fun 'n Cheesy ""Chiller Theater"" Flick","I saw this on the boob tube when I was a little tot and never forgot it; especially the ending. Wow. I loved it. Never forgot the last scene. Not what I expected.I will not spoil the ending like other reviewers. (You know who you are, and you should warn folks by typing SPOILER ALERT or something similiar before screwing it up for other people. It's a shame that it doesn't occur to your little brain that someone may not have seen the movie and doesn't want to know how it ends.)That being said, this is one of those silly horror movies to throw on when you feel like a campy/creepy 1970's frightfest ...with a memorable final shot.I grew up in the 70's/80's, and loved those spooky late night b-movie shows on TV. It's great that these old 'chiller theater' titles are being released on disc. There should be a TV channel that plays these old films again, like a Horror Network. But then we'd have commercials, so dvd is definitely preferred."
3,Shatner vs Spiders,"Captain Kirk takes on the Arachnid Empire in this horribly great 70s horror flick. If you can ignore the bad acting, the cheesy effects, and last but not least, the fact that tarantulas don't spin webs, it's worth a look. William Shatner gives a much better performance than he did in most of his classic series, and watching spiders crawl over corpses is always creepy. Low budget classic is well worth a look."
5,Gene Cole,I REMEMBER SEEING THIS MOVIE AS A KID AND IT WAS PRETTY SCARY BECAUES THE DARKEST OF MOTHER NATURE WERE THE DEVIL PETS TURN ON THE HUMANS AND EAT THEM FOR WHAT THEY BEEN DOING KILLING OFF THERE FOOD AND THEY FEAST UPON THE FLESH AND THE HUMANS DID IT TO THERE SELF.
3,Effective and bone-chilling Shatner vehicle,"Story of a small western town slowly but surely taken over by deadly tarantulas. As Dr. Robert ""Rack"" Hansen, Bill Shatner turns in a brilliant and strong performance. Tiffany Bolling as the sexy entemologist (sp?) is superbly cast as well. The film is an unusual, memorable and highly effective monster flick. Well worth multiple viewings."
3,low budget fun flick.,"this movie is a fun flick with decent acting done on a low budget, the spiders seem to be mutants as tarantulas don't spin webs but it's still a fun flick that remains worth watching for fans of low budget 70's horror. The film doesn't offer the typical man overcomes all ending either which is to be applauded. The dvd looks pretty good and that better than some releases."
4,Kingdom fo the Spiders - DVD,I saw this movie years ago and was happy to find it on DVD. It was corny but fun. The quality of the DVD was excellent. William Shatner was actually pretty hot!
2,Classic '70s sci-fi trash,"In yet another one of those don't-mess-with-Mother-Nature science-fiction flicks, William Shatner plays a small-town veterinarian who, along with a university researcher (Bolling), tries to figure out why thousands of tarantulas have suddenly descended upon Verde Valley, Arizona. Shatner gives a surprisingly restrained and effective performance, which makes you wonder what he could have done if he hadn't wasted most of his career making all those Star Trek movies. The apocalyptic, supposed-to-blow-your-mind ending is utterly preposterous, but that's part of what makes this film such a priceless piece of '70s drive-in trash.Two and a half stars out of five."
1,this should have been a comdey,this was the most laughable movie about spiders that i have ever seen.it took me two days to watch and then i wound up giving it to a friend to take to a pawn shop because he needed money. this movie was a joke!!
3,Old fashioned liberal hogwash at its finest.,A pretty goofy plot of course meant to bolster the anti-DDT morons. Itwas entertaining and ended pretty good as far as loony left fear-mongering goes.Al Gore needs a critter flick. It could help the control freaks be a little more inventive.
1,I hate spiders,"No, really, I absolutely hate spiders, all species, and think they should all be killed immediately with flamethrowers.Based on that, you'd wonder why I sat up late one night and watched this film. I'm a glutton for punishment, I guess. The film stars William Shatner and Tiffany Bolling as well as approximately 5,000 assorted spiders including tarantulas, wolf spiders, bola spiders, and a few others I won't bother to look up on Wikipedia.The plot is essentially a ripoff of ""Jaws"" with some science fiction thrown in for good measure: a town is threatened with mutant spiders who've somehow developed higher than usual levels of toxicity due to illegal waste dumping near their desert homes. The spiders, somehow realizing that humans are to blame, attack the town, its residents, and all of the town's livestock and pets.The acting is passable and the special effects aren't totally bad. It's the sight of hundreds of spiders everywhere that will make you sleep with the lights on."
4,Great Cult Entertainment,"A good B-movie/cult film always has certain elements that make it enjoyable. Kingdom of the Spiders even has a great B-movie title.Harkening back to the time when films like this were made at a fantastic rate, KOS is the cream of the crop. An actually quite intelligent movie that has good special effects for its time, this is very entertaining movie that doesn't cop out during its entire running time.While William Shatner is known for giving outrageous and campy performances, e.g. T.J. Hooker, The Wrath of Khan (Khan! KHAN!!!), he gives the ultimate B-movie performance. The supporting cast is less capable, but being the name, Shatner entertains like he is supposed to.The spiders are the real draw though, and they're actually quite well done, but nothing like the realistic spiders in a movie from today like Eight Legged Freaks.Overall, this is highly entertaining shlock that will be sure to give you enjoyment. Also, the ending is brilliant."
5,The restoration is worth it!,"I enjoyed watching this movie on television for years. However, the print was always faded. I am glad it has been given a complete restoration! This DVD is worth every penny."
4,Great Movie...Kinda Goofy,"Its a great movie if you are terrified of spiders, but it is at times a bit goofy. Not bad for the price and for people who like to collect these classic films"
4,Scares the _____ out of me!,This movie though it is really old is very scary for me both because it is about spiders which I hate and the idea that things could really do this if us humans destroy their food. I have always been scared when watching this movie and will never change. Watch it and see for yourself!!
4,Fantastic transfer and a fun movie with some great extras.,"This Special Edition version of Kingdom Of The Spiders is far superior to the full frame version that I bought a few years ago and the Bill Shatner interview is a must for all the Shatner fans out there, he is an entertaining storyteller. Only thing left is to release this on Blu-Ray with a Hi-Def transfer and it would get a 5 star from me."
4,"Surprisingly fun, campy flick!","I bought this movie on DVD for a ""corney horror movie marathon"" that my wife and I have every summer. We watched old late 60's to 70's horror flicks and laugh at the camp and corn. This movie was cheesy but it did have some scary moments as far as my wife was concerned!? She jumped and screamed three or four times and even I was in suspense a couple of times. Shatner is his usual self....over-the-top and grandiose, what can we say...Shatner being Shatner! Tiffany Bolling is really a cornball! She takes herself too seriously in this. It was interesting to see Marcy Rafferty, Shatner's wife at the time, in this movie, playing his sister-in-law. The end of the movie, phhhewww! Shocking! LOL...Honestly, my wife and I had FUN watching this movie. It wasn't AS corney as I thought it would be. It was entertaining and definitely worth the cheap price of the DVD. But it for Halloween! Classic..."
3,Oh what a tangled web we weave,"An Arizona town is a last chance for a snack on the great spider migration. They'll get you and your little dog too.This film has it all, dumb politicians, a sheriff that thinks he can handle anything, stat authorities that will investigate in a few days, people staying home with confronted with inevitable doom; well you get the picture.If that is not enough you get other alien creatures like William Shatner. Makes you want to go on vacation.The one thing you will find missing is flame throwers. Without them the world is doomed."
2,You have to really HOPE this was at least half-intended,"to be a comedy, because it definitely works on that level, though likely not as intentionally as it does. You've already read about Shatner... hey, the guy's doing the best that he can, ya know? Don't forget that Bill's a pretty limited actor to start with. It was a shame to see Woody Strode kind of wasted, since he never really got his due. But what really makes this thing laughable is how the people ""fight"" the spiders. Didn't anyone ever hear of Raid or fire? Altavose Davis' role (like Sammy didn't have a hand in getting her this part) is to die for, it's so lame. Great fun for under 10 bucks."
1,low budget,"I purchased this dvd hoping to be mildly entertained,but the acting is so bad and the story is so silly ....really dont waste your money and time ."
1,Disappointed at not receiving,"I was hoping I could let you know that, in spite of many contacts with mr.cramer, I think it was a giant run-a-round. He kept saying it was in the mail...or that he was away and didn't get it sent at first. I asked him to please at least refund my money...altho...I really did want that movie because it was filmed in the little town where I live. I have seen the movie a couple times before...it's kinda silly...but we liked it anyway and wanted our own copy. So...I question the honesty of this person who was supposed to send it. Again...thank you for letting me have my say. Warm regards....Kathy Nelson"
2,Poor design,I bought this watch because I like the Nautica name and because I was looking for a stainless steel water proof watch that had an alarm. The other review of this watch is correct in that this watch is VERY hard to set. The other problem I have with this watch is the alarm isn't loud enough. I can hardly hear it. For the price I am disappointed and cannot recommend this watch to anyone.
1,Waste,"All of these products (i.e. Barcus Barry piezo transducer products) are easily made from components available at electronics supply stores for a fraction of the price.Do a search on ""contact microphone."""
1,Not for me.,"Personally I wouldn't give this item house room, but a friend wanted them so as a good deed I got the cd's for her."
5,Love It!,"I love this CD, it is my kind of music and I can play it day after day. It is soft and soothing to listen to. I have been disappointed with other Johnny Mathis CD's I have purchased, they were too jazzy for me. I bought a second copy for a gift."
4,Very Much a Classic,"One of the most romantic recordings of the twentieth century. If you are interested in learning what the big deal was about almost fifty years ago, I recommend that you pick this one up. Mathis' interpretation of ""Embraceable You"" alone is worth the price of this album.""Open Fire, Two Guitars"" showcases Mathis at the peak of his powers. Mathis's voice, a sensitive and often fragile instrument, is put to excellent use here; strong and clear and direct, he has rarely sounded this impeccable since, which is saying something, given his steller fifty plus year career."
5,CD purchased aschristmas gift,I bought this as a present for a dear friend who loves Johnny Mathis as I do but she also loves country music so this was really right up her alley and she LOVES it!!!
3,Overcharged,"Open Fire Two GuitarsReceived products promptly and in good order and I am verypleased with the quality. However, this was a buy two andget the third one free but I was charged for all three."
2,A reworked women's skirt,"I was rather excited to find someone still carrying these, and now I see why many people do not. Although it is listed as a Hiking ""Kilt"", it has no pleats. It has the open end of the apron on the left (a kilt is on the right). Ok, that I knew before I ordered it, but putting it on its obviously not originally designed for men, just modified and relabled.BEWARE, these run VERY small. I got an XL and I normally comfortably wear an L in any hiking shorts or pants. The XL was so small I needed to fit in a different belt. Also, articulation is very poor compared to hiking shorts or any kind of real kilt, if I try to step higher than two feet at a time it binds up pretty badly.On the plus sides it was cheap, and it is very light fabric. It keeps down well in the wind. It would be nice if it wasn't so low at the hem though, even with the lightweight fabric its still warmer than my kilts because the hem is so low."
5,great book!,This is a fantastic book about Stanford! Our son loves the school and hopes to attend one day- he spends hours pouring over this book-gives a great history and has many beautiful pictures- would absolutely recommend!
4,Wartime suspense,What an interesting book - so unlike any book I've read before. The story line was interesting and kept my interest all the way through.My book was the hardback not paperback. My mistake here.
2,"Not available for fully grown men, it seems","Probably a great product, so if your a child, woman or man under 5'7 and/or weigh less than 200lbs.. these probably work for you.I've got quite normal legs, but for some bizarro reason, the XL size of these things is about 1.5-2"" too small to close around my calf. Its not like I have Schwarzeneggeresque calf muscles. Seems to me OR is targeting the small folks for its products.I guess the rest of us don't get to snowshoe. I'd look for another make or try on a local product in person if you are over 5'7"" and/or over 200lbs.Crazy but true."
2,"Great film, awful quality DVD","The other reviewers here capture the essence of this film Suffice to say, a film made with a sense of urgency by the film makers horrified by the direction of their society, with a simple message ""When a things become horrific enough, it doesn't matter who started them, all that matters is that they stop""So... what's the problem? Its a $20+ DVD, which contains a 4:3 image which is pillarboxed all the way through on a 16:9 TV. Unfortunately, the 4:3 image was a letterboxed version of the original film, so what you end up seeing is a small movie image surround by a black frame. Not good enough.Perhaps its just my setup, but...."
5,One of the best.,"Mr. Gay has written one of the better baseball books I have ever read. Tris Speaker is a great read. The author weaves the history of the game and its relationship with Speaker. As a Red Sox fan, I've always been interested in learning more about Speaker and this book filled that void.Great job."
4,Solid baseball biography,"Solid, but with a few glaring factual errors (Matty didn't win 383 games!). The best parts of this book actually deal with the widespread gambling scandlas that occured in the teens and the twenties that I had never heard about, aside from the Black Sox and the Dutch leonard scandal - there's a book about that waiting to be written as well! Otherwise, a good read that gives you a good portrait of the tough, intelligent and complicated Speaker (a former Klansman who married an Irish Catholic, went to the Bar Mitzvahs of his Jewish best friend, and tutored Larry Doby, the first Black player in the AL, on playing centerfield)."
4,Great for women and gay men,"Definately an X rated DVD. I didn't care for the DVD myself. But, I didn't buy it for me, an my Gay friend loves it and says he enjoys it upon occassion."
2,Not what I expected,A compendium of interviews with gay men. Would have preferred seeing more scenes on the street. They are indoors and I like the outdoors. I guess I just need more visual stimulation. I did not hear much in the interviews that made me perk up and say really! I will watch it again but not that impressed. I would love to see something similar with transgendered women.
2,well Id like to have heard from some guys 17-19 yo..............,I d say there about the most views Id get from some of the guys workin the street streets of Atlanta Ga its not that some of them are great looking guys but they make there johns great company its all about closeness and bonding you know what we all want they just feel they need to have men pay them.....but they might give it away if they made money outher ways...its my view well whats yours ......Alleo
1,Weak,Reads like a not particularly well researched graduate paper.The title promised so much more and the material has been far better covered elsewhere.
3,Stats about growing up female in Nazi Germany,"It was very dry, with some stories from individuals about what it was like for them growing up in that area. It had a lot of stats, and listed rules, and how they were covered. Not quite what I was looking for, but still interesting."
5,An Inspiring Story of One Young Woman's Devotion,"The true-life story of the ""Dairyman's Daughter"" (who lived during the early 1800's) will forever impact your life! The daughter was once a woman of the world, but the Lord opened her eyes to her sinful nature and purified her heart. She was a shining example of Christ to all those who were around her. I would recommend this book to anyone who desires a deeper love in Jesus Christ!"
2,Did not work,"Well, simply put the printer rejected it and I ended up throwing it all out. It's a shame too, it would have been nice to get the printer working with the ink."
3,Generaly Field Guide,I recommend looking at this book in your local book store before purchasing it. It has some good information in it but it is not organized very well.
3,"Um,heavier than Sabbath?!?","No offense to the bloke that wrote the previous review,but ""as heavy as Sabbath""?Um,not quite.Not even close,really.Not to say this isnt a worthwhile disc because it is,particularly if you are into obscure early 70's hard rock.Ian Gillan produced this,and though this doesnt really sound like Deep Purple,that would be by far a more accurate comparison.If your collection revolves around obscure 70's hard rock acts,add a star to my rating: for the casual listener or just the curious,I stick by my 3 star rating"
3,clogs one color often,"This is the only color cartridge approved for the Epson C62 so I buy it. I have used many of these cartridges, but all have had problems with one color or another clogging up so that only two colors are used. I waste a lot of ink cleaning the print heads so that a few pages will come out nicely colored, but then one clogs up and I clean the heads again. Luckily the black is not also a problem. Most often it is the magenta that quits working."
5,Definatly worth it!,It came in less than 5 days. It matched perfectly with my printer so I do not have to worry about not being able to print things. And was very affordable and reasonably priced as well.
3,PRETTY NICE MYSTERY,"I really enjoyed this Agatha Christie book. It was a real good mysetry that I occupied my time reading. I was very surprised at who the killer was. This book was one huge problem a few die+ a few investagations+ a view of all suspects, lastly you find out who the killer really is. If you enjoy mysteries I recommend this book to you, it's really not a waste of your time!"
3,Plug and Chug Murder Mystery,"This book is the closest a mystery can come to being a math problem. We start with a couple of murders, we organise our little group of detectives, they interrogate ALL the possible suspects, add up what they know, and--with a little help from M. Poirot--the killer is revealed. This is a simple plug-and-chug murder mystery.Now, I'm not saying I figured it out. I didn't. And I was surprised by the ending and who the killer was revealed to be. But until the last twenty pages or so, I felt like I was reading a manual on how to write a detective story. A little murder, add colorful suspects, just a pinch of romance, some amateur sleuthing, and, of course, the star detective. A little too by-the-book.I still recommend it because the fun of the ending makes up for the tedium you had to endure."
3,Mechanical but Effective,"A kindly vicar is poisoned via cocktail at an egocentric actor's party, leaving Poroit to sort through a number of suspicious characters and contradictory clues. This particular Christie novel is pure plot, with the characters never quite coming fully to life; even so, Christie delivers a remarkable solution sure to amaze."
3,Sharon Holmes reviewing Three Act Tragedy,The book was good but not one of Christie's better mysteries. I did enjoy it nevertheless. It might have been one of her earlier books the reason I wasn't real crazy about it.
4,I agree that it's like a manual but at least a good one!,"I was not surprised at the end of the book as I had been for the others I've read before. Cause I did GUESS all the method and the murderer off course.and I felt that I have completed a long way in understanding Christie method and the geniously hidden clues among the dialogs and comments of the narrator. actually it's not the first one i have guessed the murderer but was the easiest for me such that I did comprehend the whole picture at the very beggining of the book.(at least for a christie book) in this case the main clue for the facts(i mean that conversation) was a bit more clear in comparison to others(H.P.'s Christmas for example) but ,anyway it is a very interesting book, still I think and a schocking end for the readers who pass the main clue and ones who haven't read much Christie ,off course(not above 20 for example). They will be schocked, if they are not able to guess. Get and enjoy the book!"
1,"Britten: Saint Nicolas/A Ceremony of Carols - Robert Tear, Sir David Willcocks, King's College Choir, Cambridge (Purchased on 12",CD is defective. It sounds as if only on track is recorded.I have submitted this before but the link I was given to follow up on it would not open.
3,80's Revisited,"I am a casual Howard Jones fan (having owned 'Human's Lib' and 'Dream Into Action', back in the day!), but lost track of what he has done since. I picked up this CD at an airport stand, after reading the sleevenotes saying that he has added a 'live' flavour to old favourites. He recorded this album with a 'live' band in his studio, replicating how he plays the songs on stage (but without the audience of course). The results are surprisingly good and enhance his repetoire. Songs such as 'No-one Is To Blame', 'New Song' and 'Human's Lib' are all invigorated with new life. Some of the tracks on this album do not stand up well after 20yrs and it is not to everyone's taste. There is however a track on this collection 'I Must Go', which is as good a song as he has ever written and one that I was unfamiliar with, so you do get something 'new' here also. A worthwhile addition to your collection if you like Howard Jones or indeed enjoy some 80's nostalgia."
1,1 STAR SAYS IT ALL,What a waste of time. The first 70 pages make you think this is going to be a good story line with adequate character development. Author completely runs out of diaglogue and thought and fills the last 300 pages with nonsense. A vapid love story that lacks the entertainment value it is supposed to provide. BLECH.
4,Great quality,These pads are really great. They are thick and squishy and fit well onto edges. I put these on my hearth as well as the shelves of our entertainment system. The only problem is that they aren't as sticky as I would like. Although part of the problem is that my hearth is rough brick and not smooth. I have used velcro pads in the past and definitely prefer these.
5,great swimming googles,"I love this googles.. they are inexpensive and works great. My first order I got a dark color that didn't work well in indoors pool. So if you are planning to swim indoors make sure to choose the clear colors so you can see well.Enjoy,Suzana"
3,"Not bad, just not great","I've been heavily into the Pixies since ""Surfer Rosa"", and have been repeatedly challenged by Frank Black's solo work, which always exceeds my expectations. Can't say why I would doubt him, since he's written so many brilliant songs. Unfortunately, this is the first time I would say I come away disappointed. And I think it has a lot to do with the musicians playing on the recording. Many great ones, but more commonly heard playing the mellower side of rock. My guess is that The Catholics wouldn't have permitted Frank Black to sound like he's playing to 40-somethings who are comfortable with an adventurous rocker slipping into cruise-control. Who knows, maybe it will garner him some new fans."
4,A slightly indulgent masterpiece,"Frank Black is in my humble opinion America's finest song writer. As much as I loved (and still love) the Pixies, his recent work as a solo artist has been nothing short of amazing. His music has simply become warmer and more inviting and as I have gotten older, become a father and generally experienced more life, I find his solo material speaks to me like nothing else can. The ballad ""Sad Old World"" is simply gorgeous, while ""Kiss My Ring"" and ""Fitzgerald"" are uptempo gems. The highlight may be the cover of ""Dirty Old Town"" which sounds like Frank and the band were having the time of their life. The production is a tad flat, and like most double albums it can be a bit indulgent, but that's just nitpicking. Keep them coming Frank cause I'd pay to see you play the spoons while sitting in a rocking chair."
5,His best album in a while,"Like many of Frank Black Francis' compositions, I was lukewarm on this album at first, particularly since I thought the double album was gratuitous, even for this incredibly prolific man. Now that I have given it a few listens, though, I have to say I love it (like almost all his compositions). I think this is his best album since the first Catholics album, or maybe even Cult of Ray. Frank is back!"
5,This ain't your Pixies Black,"If you liked Honeycomb as much as I did, you're in for a treat with these 27 tracks that rock in a slightly different way than we're used to hearing Frank.This is much more good old fashioned country rock. It's music with a heart, and the sound quality of the CDs are amazing, it sounds like you're in the lounge hearing it all.I'm glad to see Frank keeps evolving and I can't wait to see what he'll churn out next."
3,Open up the tired eye's,"frank is a prolific writer,and that's a good thing.but it may be starting to catch up with him.this latest effort has too much filler.honeycomb drug on a bit in my opinion.fast man,raider man is like it's two headed ugly twin brother.there's some really good track's here,dirty old town,if your poison get's you.if you picked 10 to 12 of the best song's you would have a better album.it's too much,and getting redundant.honycomb and fast man,come across as frank trying to do neil young,tonight's the night,and that should be great,but at last,it's just not turning my knob's.don't get me wrong,this album has it's good point's,but i think he's making the same mistake ryan adam's is.that is putting every song onto a disc.I still recommend this album,if your a hardcore frank black fan you have to buy it.3 1/2 stars."
5,A victory for Nonsycophants everywhere!,This book reveals the we must not always follow societal norms. Nonsycophants will delight in this classic.
1,Hasn't this been done before?,"Give me a break! Are the previous reviewers of this book friends or relatives of the author or what?! I thought the humor was rather forced, and when an author tries to be funny, it ain't funny! Also, is it really necessary to use four letter words to get a laugh? I don't think so! The idea is also not all that original. Anybody out there remember Paternity with Burt Reynolds and Michelle Pfeiffer? If they really do make this into a movie, I, for one, won't be seeing it!"
2,Father doesn't know best,"The beginning of the book is interesting and promising. And then it falls apart. The main actors are not believable and fall out of character. Nothing in Charlie's previous life indicates that he will turn into a clutz and go ape about a baby that may not even be his. Nobody halfway sober would sign the kind of agreement he did. And Lacy, that superwoman with a 17-year old daughter, completely negates her baby.Life is not like this, and no humor or satire will make it so. I guess even the author realised this when she tried to straighten it out on the last pages."
3,Easy reading,"This is an enjoyable book that is easy to read and relatively funny along the way, but the ending could have been dealt with better. This is a fun and light book to read if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday, but I certainly won't be running to the bookstore when this author publishes another book."
4,A pretty good collection of seeds,"This collection offers a nice assortment of organic seeds... most of them sprouted well in our FreshLife sprouter, though the garbonzo beans were pretty much a mess. This is a big sampler pack, so now that I know which sprouts grow well and are tasty I can just get specific seeds in the future instead of an assortment."
1,Can't even use it,"Sent me expired product, this is ridiculous & very inconvenient. Not sure what I will do now because I really needed this & can't find it locally."
