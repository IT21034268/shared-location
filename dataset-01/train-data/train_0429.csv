5,The Best of Its Kind,"I was one of the wives who remained in Baumholder during the deployment of 1AD to Iraq, and Jessica's book is spot-on. The events are real, the emotions are real, and these families are the real thing. I read this book in a day with a box of Kleenex by my side. It's the best book I've read in a long time."
5,Great Book!!,"Being a military wife is hard... It gets even worse once you are alone b/c your husband is deployed. An unfamiliar home, no friends, no stable jobs, ALONE. I know this all too well. My husband just recently deployed and has been once before and this book gave me a sense of comfort knowing that some other woman in this world has had or has the same problems I do. I would definately recommend this book to any military wife, deployed hubby or not."
5,Absence makes the heart grow fonder,Very riveting stories of the independence and strength of women as they encounter a year out of their lives!! I would recommend every Family Readiness Support Group have this in their arsenal of support!!
2,"Too Wordy, Too Big","Not the greatest legal text. I realize Constitutional opinions are friggin' long, but this book is still too much. They should cut at least 20% of it. I had a really hard time lugging this massive thing around Boston all the time. Plus, it just wasn't the greatest casebook to begin with; too wordy and too superfluous."
4,A great old standard in Constitutional education,"The textbook approaches Con Law with a thorough historical perspective. It truly delivers a framework for the PROCESS of ""Constitutional Decision Making."""
1,Boring as hell,"Seriously, this book is just awful. But I guess if you're in law school there's no helping that."
4,Great knife for the money,"I received then knife really fast and they tossed in a bamboo back scratcher. One thing the add didn't say is that it is a #2 Cleaver(8""x4"") I'm glad I didn't get a #1. There was a little rust nothing to complain about It cleaned up easy. The edge needed a little sharpening not bad at all. I used the box it came in to make a case/sleeve for it.For the Money it is awesome"
5,Best inexpensive (NOT cheap) cleaver out there,"It came razor sharp, has great balance and is inexpensive. Sure you have to towel dry it, but that's a small price to pay for such a great knife."
3,Rather Dull and too much Focus on Astrology,"This book is interesting for one reason, and one reason alone: Joan Quigley, as Mrs. Reagan's personal astrologist, was able to influence world events. At least, that's what appears to be the case if one believes Ms. Quigley's account. However, considering how exciting this book could have been, it is actually rather dull. There is a lot of talk about astrological signs and symbols that the average reader has no chance of understanding.I do not believe in astrology. The most interesting part about Ms. Quigley's contention that astrology is a respectable field--just like any scientific endeavor. If that is true, why is Ms. Quigley free to publish her private accounts with Mrs. Reagan? If astrology is a respectable field, shouldn't there be limits to how much information you can reveal about private information with another person?"
4,good lesson,"this book is one of the great book. It teach many lessons to children. One is to teach children to help those who are less fortunate. Futhermore, this book teach children to be brave and made their own decision upon what is right rather than follow the crowd. I think if the book change the character's race like make Prietita a white kid and helping a mexican boy, this book will teach the children another lesson that helping is regardless of race and sex."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I used to have a silver color telescoping mic stand made out of aluminum. It was good but somehow through the years it got misplaced. So this one was a replacement. It's thicker than the one I used to have and I prefer ther black color. The best is part however is in carrying it. When you move lots of equipment back and forth from gigs, you try to minimize the amount of stuff you have to carry. When these fold down, they're small enough to fit in a one small gig bag. I eventually ordered 3 of these things. The other guys in the band asked me to order some for them as well. Well worth the price."
3,displeased by the recording process,"I was wondering if Mahler's music was so intringuing and mistique as some people say. Despite personal tastes, I find that this particular SACD (or those who are encoded in 44khz/24 bits instead of 88khz) sounds artificial, without bright or space definition, as other great sacd's. I would recommend this sort of records on standard cd."
3,Not for Beginners,"This is a good book for advanced users of ADO, however if you just started using ADO and want a good background and solid knowledge base of the subject this is not the book to get. The book has most of its examples in VB. I was looking for some ASP examples and it definetly lacks good ASP support. I would suggest getting WROX's ADO 2.5 book if you're starting out using ADO."
4,How to program w/ ADO correctly,"This book covers programming with ADO thoroughly and well. Vaughn does not only take you thru the best practices but also thru the questionable ones. You will learn why a best practice is a best practice. You will also learn the proper syntax to use in commands as well as the purpose of many of the options that are w/in a command. (The options we see in the VB IDE but never know how to use.) I found the book extremely readable and obviously extremely valuable. If you plan on using ADO you should have this book, it really should be part of the VB programmers canon. The one negative on the book is that while it references ADO 2.6 alot it does not really get into it. There also is not very much XML support. i am sure future versions will correct these mistakes."
4,Fuentes,"Carlos Fuentes is a wonderful writer who is able to explore several different topics and themes within one book. He addresses many things in a complex and profound manner which leaves the reader speechless and pondering (i.e., significance of names, conception, identity, memories etc). He has a great talent for writing beautiful language that flows and sounds playful and fun. Not to mention, Fuentes also explores some obscure and unusual aspects of different cultures such as vagina dentata. However, despite all these amazing and great attributes of his multifarious perspective and mind, the lack of knowledge in Mexican history or in any of the topics Fuentes covers will hinder your reading. I found it most difficult to fully enjoy his work due to my insufficient understanding of the events. If you are not well versed in politics and history, then it will be a tough read but if you are, then enjoy!"
3,"At this price, OK but....","I received my InfoCard yesterday, promptly shipped by Back Country (good outfit, by the way).The price I paid of around $40 was a bargain, compared to the original price as well as other seller's prices.However, I have some caveats for others interested in these cards:First, the cards were created in 2003 - all business listings and telephone numbers on them are already six years old;Second, the maps on my card were not just six years old, but showed railroad tracks that were removed back in 1977 (!);Third, the card installs in place of the SD card I was using for backup - that's right, it's an either/or situation.Still, the cards are far better than the poor overall USA map (sketch would be more exact) that comes with the Brunton Atlas. Most of the local roads are present, and the Brunton is far more useful to me because of that.So at this price it wasn't a bad buy, I guess!"
3,extremely juvenile,"If your child is precocious, this book will not do the job. It is on the level of ""See Spot run."""
2,I was disappointed,This book was presented as appropriate for 4-8 year olds. Amazon needs to re-classify this book for 2-3 year olds. This was the first time I regretted my purchase.
2,Not great...,"I bought this book because my son started talking about outer space and rockets, etc... I also bought it because we have several other Byron Barton books and my son really enjoys reading and looking at. However, this book is a little boring, doesn't keep his interest and isn't on the same level as the other Barton books."
3,good condition,I received my book in a timely manner and was satisfied with the condition of the book.
1,I Want to Be an Astronaut,"Not what I expected at all. The pictures are awful and the story itself takes me back to ""See Spot Run"". I was embarassed to give it to my 4 year old nephew who has just showed quite an interest in outer space."
4,Nice book for little kids,"I bought this one several years ago for my oldest son, now my little guy loves it, too. It seems a bit sad to me now in the wake of the Columbia tragedy (""I want to be an astronaut, a member of the crew"" sounds somewhat different now), but that doesn't really affect little kids. If you or your kids are space nuts, this is a good one to begin with."
5,grandma,The book arrived before schedule. It was perfect since I was visiting the Grandchild that week. It was in great condition and exceeded my expectation. Great job
3,Swedish Wonder,A great book for genealogists. The photo's were greatand the stories were made clear and full of information.I know anyone with a Swedish background will love readingthis book.
2,Poor 3D experience,The title of this BD 3D DVD is a little misleading. It mainly talked about the migration of sardine in South Africa and its upstream food chains. It is an interesting story. The movie has a lot of mediocre footages that are not good for 3D experience.
1,I Would Rate this with No Stars if it were Possible!,"Grab a puke bucket as you'll be sick from buying this.Here is what you get: Sardines swimming in circles for half, yes - half!, the movie. I understand that the little stinky things were the ""highlight"" but they are the entire movie!Sardines swimming here. Sardines there. Oh look, other birds, fish and stuff are hungry. Cue the Sardines! They must know the producer or something.Really? Nothing wild about their featured Ocean.3D: Horrible for the underwater shots. Great for above water shots. But, don't we want to see great underwater shots - AFTER ALL the movie is WILD OCEAN.I really wish there were more sardines swimming in circles. Couldn't get enough."
3,it 'ok ' but ....,"Its a nice story but like the other reviewer I was hoping for a better 3D experience , what annoyed me the most is the narrator - he has a thick south African accent and can be hard to clearly hear - its distracting - he sounds a little like Morgan Freeman but its not him.... I was hoping to see more species - there are a lot of dolphins and sardines but I wanted to see more .... btw the channel n3d on directv airs this program for free in 3d as well...."
1,"""African Sardines""?","They should have called this movie ""African Sardines"". What a stupid movie and a waste of money. If you pay more than $10.00 for this you got ripped off.(I did) The 3-D is good and had allot of depth throughout the movie but unfortunately it had several spots where there is moderate ""ghosting"" which ruined it. Like the previous review, I couldn't understand most of what was said due to the heavy accent of the narrator. The movie was about the plight of the sardine population in Africa or something like that."
3,Nice but short blu ray movie,"The video quality was great. This isn't a long movie, but it was well put together, and I think it was worth it."
1,Waste of Money,"Having a label of IMax and being Blu-Ray, I thought it would be visually stunning. I've seen better quality pictures on regular cable TV."
2,Not the best 3D,I was not impressed with this 3D DVD and would not recommend it. Audio was very poor to the point that the narrator could not be heard at times. If you are into looking at nothing but schools of sardeans you may like it.
3,A bit repetitious,"This was given to me as a gift and the title sounded like it would be a lot more exciting than it was. There are some nice shots of the dolphins and lots and lots of sardines, but it tends to be somewhat repetitious of the same shots over and over again. Not a bad movie to watch, but I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it:-)"
2,"Boring, bland, and bland..","I couldnt wait to get this movie. I was so disappointed with the ghosting and grainy quality of this film. I have the Panasonic Magnolia 3DTV and it still didnt help. There was some good 3D (very little) so I cant give it one star. If you know some one who has the movie, see it for yourself before you buy it."
1,SPARE YOURSELVES! AGONIZING NARRATION DUE TO DEEP FOREIGN ACCENT!,"Do yourself a large favor and don't ever purchase or watch this 3D blu-ray. First off, the narration is done by someone with a deep foreign accent. If you're overseeing an English narration of a film, how about you utilize a native speaker of the language. Who wants to sit through a documentary listening to the narrator struggle with his pronunciation of the English language? The lack of common sense involving the narration is utterly SAD.Along with the narration is a lame story of fish migration. Spare yourselves from the agony that this documentary brings on by abstaining from either purchasing this 3D blu-ray or watching it. You'll be doing yourself a favor. TRUST ME!"
2,Rent maybe; don't buy,Dull dull dull. Half the time showing nothing but sardines and most of the rest is on land in south Africa. The tone is a sledgehammer political Eco lecture. Winner of this. Winner of that. Finalist of this and That. Nonsense. How did this win film medals. It certainly doesn't deserve it. It was a total waste of money. I really didn't care for the heavy handed lecturing.
2,Mediocre 3D and boring presentation,"Agree with most of the reviewers on this. This blu-ray has mediocre 3d. the story is about sardines. So improper title too. The narrator's accent is bit put off too. There is considerable ghosting on few scenes and initially i was thinking it may be my TV.. but seeing some of the reviewers, i think it might be a poor conversion. Not worth the price - which is about 19/- that i paid."
3,Wild Oceans,"I would rate this as just okay,I think it might be more appropriate for younger children as they might see the wow factor that eludes most adults.I also don't like the subtle left leaning messages about the damage mankind is doing to the oceans"
1,Boring,"Very boring video. All they show is dolfins and sardeens. U see it all within the first couple minutes. This was the first 3D movie I watched, and I was expecting to be impressed, not bored. :)"
2,Too short for the price,"First off for the length of the ""movie"" the price should be at least half of what it's selling for. The movie's 3D effects were cool but I thought there could have been more. There were some amazing shots but a lot of the 3D was ""background"" style 3D not the stuff you expect (things coming at you,etc). Additionally the majority of the movie focuses on Sardines and their Migration, NOT about the entire Ocean (misleading title of the movie)."
2,Returned,"If you are looking for a great 3D experience, look elsewhere. I was very disappointed with this 3D movie. The effects were less than dramatic and the ocean story was boring. It would be well worth it to spend the extra money on a higher rated ocean 3D. That's excactly what I've done. I don't even want this one in my collection."
2,Mediocre,"Mediocre narrative (sophomoric/juvenile script, sometimes unintelligible narrator). Some very nice footage, but also a LOT of mediocre fillers that have nothing to do with the ocean. Another IMAX/BD piece, ""The Living Sea"" is better."
3,Unusual Medical Thriller,Not a run of the mill medical thriller. The main character's frequent introspection's makes for an interesting flow in the story line. Good character definition and well plotted mystery make this a fast and entertaining read.
2,deception,"i don't liked all is japanese transformers i expect more but this is junk,goofy music worst buy ever am a fan for the original and this is a joke"
3,very average,"Nothing that special. I got a medium, the shoulders fit ok, the arms small, the waist/torso loose (bigger than should)."
2,Chipped dishes,"I bought 8 place settings of these dishes as I thought they would be just as great as the other pfaltzgraff dishes that I has bought previously, I'm very disappointed as just about everyone one of my dinner plates have chips or big chunks of the finish coming off of them. These are a beautigful design, to bad that I wasted the money on them as they aren't holding up at all and I'll probably have to go out and buy new dishes again."
5,The cutest book ever,My son loves this book... The story is so cute and the detail in the drawing are great. This is a must buy.
3,"Like the artwork, not so sure about the story.","Let me just say that I love the artwork here. I love the clean black-and-white, and the strong lines. I think it's very well-suited for this story.Unfortunately, some aspects of the story... I'm not so thrilled with. I think that the kitten suffers more than enough on his quest (it gets almost painful for me to read). I also just don't find the story itself that interesting. My nieces haven't requested a re-read. *shrugs* Can't like every book, I guess. Good thing I checked this out from the library first!"
1,Not for Young Children,"I like Kevin Henke's other books ( especially ""A Good Day"") but I cannot recommend this book. It's too painful for young children. Young children tend to identify with baby animal characters in picture books, and the kitten in this book is shown as a helpless victim. The illustrations are beautiful but they don't lessen the cruelty the kitten suffers. If you're looking for a gentle bedtime book, I'd recommend ""The Tiny Patient"", by Judith Pederson, or ""At Night"" by Jonathan Bean, instead."
2,Ann's Review of Kitten's First Full Moon,I thought that this book was okay. I liked the pictures but they didn't look real hard to draw. And it won an award too.
4,Ivan's review of Kitten's First Full Moon,I think that its a good child's book.I like when the kitten found the milk because I think that the milk was there the whole time.I like the whole book.yes I did because the kitten did a lot of funny things.yes because they can tell there brother or sister.
5,Gorgeous and Charming,A black-and-white picture book that is more gorgeous than any color book I've seen in a long time. Henkes' kitten is charming and beautifully drawn; the text is simple enough for a child to memorize but as rhythmic and elegant as haiku. A great book to read aloud at bedtime. Deserves the Caldicott medal fifty times over. My two-year-old niece was captivated by the bold lines of the illustrations; my four-year-old nieces loved the simple but clever story about the kitten who longs for that little bowl of milk waiting for her in the sky - the full moon.
4,Cute story-Great Pictures,"My 3 year old daughter enjoys having stories read to her each night. This book has become part of our bedtime ritual. She loves the kitten in the story, and I love the pictures. Even though they are black and white (looks like charcoal drawings), the pictures are great. The expressions on the kitten's face are priceless."
4,"Well illustrated, very cute.","My eight month old loves this book. The illustrations are large and black and white, making them easy for a little one to appreciate. The story is a good one, about a little kitten trying to get something she can't and getting into trouble. It's a story babies can relate to!"
5,My favorite bedtime book,"I bought this before my daughter was born and enjoyed reading it to her while she was in utero. Now that she is 10 months old, I enjoy watching her try to grab the ""bowl of milk"" on the pages, just as Kitten does. This is a sweet book that we can enjoy again once she begins reading. Add this to your library!"
5,A favorite in our house,"Kitten's First Full Moon is a cozy read in our house. My 6 year old (and 9 year old on occasion!) love to cuddle up and read about kitten's adventures discovering the moon is not a bowl full of milk. The black and white drawings are sweet and charming, giving warmth to a story that appeals to kids young and old. Plus, the book won a Caldecott Award for illustrations. A definite favorite in our house."
4,Sweet story for children and those who read to them,"If you love kitties and children, you will love this little book. The drawings are lovely as is the story. Highly recommended for reading out loud with a loved one."
4,It's a good book,I think that Kitten's Firt full moon is a good book! It's not the best book in the world but it's a good book!!! I love the illustrations. I recomend it!
3,Great Book,My 2 year old loves this book. We read it every night. My only complaint on it is that the book i bought didn't come with the book sleeve on it. Other than that the book is in great condition and such a great read for a toddler!
4,Good little story,"This is a good bedtime story, easily read and interesting for children. The pictures are wonderful"
5,One of my 2-year-old son's favorite books,My 2-year-old son loves to read this book before bed almost every night. It's been a favorite of his since he was 1. The illustrations are stunning and the story is very sweet. We love Kevin Henkes books in our house!
4,my 2 year old loves this book!,"i picked this book out from the library, even though i had my doubts. it is not fun for me to read, but my daughter loves it! even though it is black and white and very simple drawings, my daughter really gets excited about this story. she keeps saying ""oh poor kitten!"" and wants to read it over and over. i think she totally understands it, but it doesn't matter. i plan to purchase this."
5,Great bedtime story,"I LOVE this book! An absolute adorable tale of a kitten who simply wants a bowl of milk. Noticing the moon, the kitten mistakenly believes it is the bowl of milk and sets out on a night-time journey to find it.The illustrations are amazing and fit the story's simplicity."
3,Synthetic vinyl gloves - medium,"I would have to rate this item as just O.K. They work, but are thin and tear too easily putting on. You need a full box in order to complete several projects. Buy with this in mind."
4,good quality gloves for messy jobs!,"Ordinarily I cannot stand having gloves on my hands. I do not mind with these gloves at all. They are very comfortable, flexible and have enough feeling to allow you to jobs that require a lot of dexterity. I often use these for cleaning game and fish, they are that tough. These gloves ensure that I do not get infections when cleaning fish and game!The only downside I have seen so far is that my hands tend to sweat a lot inside them."
4,"Great gloves, they fit well!","I have pudgy short hands. These vinyl gloves fit great, though the fingers are longer than they need to be, but I have short fingers. I use them daily and have no issue with them. The vinyl odor is minimal and does NOT make your hands stink at all. There is no lingering odor like with latex gloves. These are a keeper for me. I use them to prepare meats with and to put ointment on my feet due to psoriasis. Very versatile!"
5,As Described,"Not much to say about vinyl gloves. The fit was good, the quality was good. Shipping was good. I wasn't disappointed in the purchase."
3,Pretty tight,Better order a size or two larger. I ordered large but they were even tight and hard to put on for my nurses and very small for me. Their not worth returning but next time I'll order XLs.
1,Safetouch gloves,"These are not worth the little bit you save from nitrile. My boss ordered these and they rip, tear and do not fit true to size. I told her if she was gonna keep buying these I'd buy my own nitrile gloves I am allergic to latex and absolutely hate the vinyl gloves unless they are good quality polyisoprene."
3,"Tear easily, but mostly fine","The goal is to keep attendants hands clean from dirt and harsh chemical cleaners during the routine running of a full-service laundry. These gloves are more like plastic food service gloves then the pliable latex gloves. I bought in bulk to save on shipping as this retailed would not offer free shipping, I would have been wise to try before buying. Nothing wrong with them, just not quite as durable as I was hoping for."
4,Pretty good,"These gloves are pretty good. The large size do run a little small and they are thinner than I would prefer. That said, I would probably order another box in a larger size. The company I usually order from only sells by the case. The last case I purchased lasted five years and I am not doing as much dirty work as I used to. For ordering by the box this is a pretty good deal."
2,A little thin,"These gloves are a little thin and tear easily, so don't use them for anything strenuous. The price should be lower."
3,Not bad,These gloves would be better if the sizing were more accurate. I wear L gloves in various glove types but these in L are a very tight fit.
3,mostly does the job,I need gloves when housecleaning or dishwashing. These don't fit very well - the mediums. Also - despite the picture you only get one box of gloves - 100 gloves or 50 pair. Other than these two things they do the job they were meant to. Haven't had a problem with tearing.
5,Great product: cheap but sturdy,"Inexpensive gloves for chores around the house. Cheaper than others, and just as good, if not better."
1,Cheap and Very Flimsy!,"In the past, I've bought vinyl gloves at Costco for various tasks around the house. These were priced much cheaper. They are also flimsy and frequently tear when putting them on. I won't be buying these again!"
1,Stay-Away From These Gloves,"To date these are the WORST gloves that I have used!!! For every glove that I'm successfullwith putting on, two will tear. On the box, they are marked LARGE, but they just meet thatqualification. They should be more of a MEDIUM. If these were selling for half price they wouldstill be a rip off! It's no wonder, they are made in China!"
4,Collectors find good use for Datigs Books,"Cartridges for Collectors, Volume 1, 2 and 3 is a very detailed and informative book on cartridges for the collector. There is much information in an easy to read format. However, many of the cartridges are experimental Swiss and other one of a kind European Cartridges. There is also plenty of info between the 3 volumes on American Centerfire, rimfire and military cartridges. It is a useful tool for some hard to find cartridges."
3,Great Music -- Too Much B.S.,"I heard the original XM radio broadcast of this concert and had high expectations for this DVD release. This is some of the best music I've ever heard from Jon Anderson... majestic, insightful, spiritual.Unfortunately, this DVD contains promotional audio spots for XM radio between almost every song (sometimes DURING the song). I paid for this DVD to hear Jon's music, not to listen to some pointy-haired executive talk OVER Jon's music about how great satellite radio is.Much effort went into the visuals accompanying the music. Occasionally they are quite appealing, other times just cheesy.This DVD is very much worth watching, especially if you haven't heard Jon's new music. But personally, I'd prefer a disc of just the concert, without all the BS."
3,SOLO TOUR OF THE XM RADIO INFOMERCIAL,"THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT ALL YES FANS WILL ENJOY THIS DISK. AS YOU KNOW IT IS PEPPERED WITH XM RADIO EXPLOITS. AS TO THE MUSIC PURE UPLIFTING JON ANDERSON. I SAW HIM LAST WEEK AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES IN CHICAGO. PURE MAGIC. BUT AS HE EVEN SAID THAT NIGHT TOUGH TO GET A CONTRACT, SO WE HAVE TO GET XM PLUGS TO HEAR A LITTLE ANDERSON, OH WELL."
2,Rip off!,"Jon Anderson is an extremely talented musician, songwriter, etc., but this particular DVD is simply a long commercial for satellite radio! It's definitely NOT a ""Tour of the Universe""! Don't waste your money."
3,"I missed the pictures in this book,","Why weren't the pictures included in this book ? I have camped all my life (71 years)& was so excited to have some really old fashioned ideas, but was disappointed the pictures were not included. Guess i didn't read the details of this printing. :-("
2,The book,"The book is really old- getting close to a century- but some of the practical advice is sound. Some of course is bereft of anything but historical value. If you want a practical guide, you can find better."
5,camping and woodcraft,i have the 1952 hard cover that was given to me by my father.after reading it twice i can see why it was his favorite book.tough man .very good book.it can still teach campers how to do it right.
3,"A slow start, but fun once you're in it.","P.N. Elrod writes some crackling fun vampire pulp fiction in her Jack Fleming series. In this book, she tells the story of Quincey Morris, whom you may remember as the Texan with the Bowie knife in Bram Stoker's Dracula.Here we find out what ""really"" happened, after Van Helsing, Harker, and Morris chased Dracula back to Transylvania. Quincey is a vampire of another kind from Dracula, and determined to get his life back, even if he is dead. After a load of adventures and trying to convince his vampire hunter friends of his good intentions, all is resolved with a twist."
5,A great spin on an old character,"Great book. Once I picked it up I could not put it down. This book takes the classic Dracula and turns it on its head. If you like vampire novels, then you will like this book. I have read about 10 books by this author and they are all well written, once you pick them up you can not put them down."
1,Childish and Silly!,It's one of those movies you know will stink big time after watching just 10 minutes of it. I managed to watch 45 minutes of it and decided to stop and write this negative review of this movie.Horrible Story!Extremely Childish!Waste of Time!
1,"There's bad (Scream), really bad (Face-off), and really, really bad (Gigli), then there's this","The beginning was awesome. The set up was great. The first 3 minutes. Then it was incoherent, horribly acted movie for retards. I use that word for lack of a better one, and its true, the movie is made for the couch numbing, greasy chip eating pizza and beer guzzling reject, who loves movies that are utter atrocities.'call me snake'Call you moron. Kurt Russell is probably one of the worst actors in the history of film. His movies are a joke and he is a joke. This film is so horrendous, I would rather go for a root canal without Novocaine.What a disaster.Edit: hours later did I just realize it was John Carpenter film. WOW I have to say out of all the directors in the industry, John Carpenter is absolutely atrocious."
1,"There was no ""zero"" star option","A movie this horrible is not only judged by how much money one wasted, but also how much of your life was taken away forever. I am now dumber for watching it. LED ZEPPELIN RULES!"
1,Escape from Carpenter's recent movies,I'm not going to waste a lot of my time on this bomb of a movie. Neither should you. It's a travesty to follow up a great movie like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK with this stinker. Better not do this to some of my other favorites like THE FOG and THE THING.
2,dissapointment,"I give this movie 2 stars. One star is for the soundtrack, which I can't help but like, and the other star is for Kurt Russel wearing the famous eyepatch once again. That is worth one star anytime. The original(Escape from New York) had the gritty feel of a world gone mad, of a country ravaged by crime and war, desperate enough to send all it's criminal element to one place. It made me wonder what an island run by criminals would be like. Escape from LA, however, is more like a parody than a sequel. The charactors and plot are just plain silly. Snake deserved better than this."
4,Believe it or not...it kinda works.,"In Escape from New York, Snake Plissken battles ruthless prison inmates, elements of a corrupt government, and miniature time-bomb implants that mean certain death if he can't escape the city in time. In Escape from L.A., Snake Plissken goes hangliding, plays basketball, and surfs. What more can I say?"
4,Snake is back . . .,"Snake Plisskin returns to beat the clock, grab the goods, and get out of LA before the Plutoxin-7 virus he's been injected with, kicks in. Totally tongue-in-cheek, this movie wasn't meant as high drama; it's an action comedy! Full of Kurt doing his best ""Dirty Harry"" improv, there are enough of shoot-outs with LA gangs to satisfy even the most die-hard action flick fans. Kurt doesn't budge an inch, bat an eye, or back down in the nearly continuous, start-to-finish action scenes. The DVD transfer is good, and the sound level consistent. A must-have for action flick fans."
3,Average at best,"This is a fun movie to watch, but hardly a worthy of the 5 star reviews listed here. For Carpenter's best work watch Escape from New York or The Thing. With L.A. he's seemly trying to repackage the same ideas for a generation too young to remember those movies when they were new. Why is Escape from New York not widely avaliable on DVD like L.A.? It's a crime!"
2,Escape from ?,"I enjoyed Escape from New York, but Escape from LA is a stinker. Very obvious CG effects, some of which only look good if using frame advance, plot holes that suck the life out of the movie, and a very weak attempt at what - -- humor, wit, parody? What's with the ""I thought you were taller""? Russell doing Eastwood doing Snake? Pam Grier, still delivering lines from a cue card. Buscemi was very good, the only character with wit and personality. Fonda? Cute, with a great surfing scene. Then there are the action movie cliches, every crashing vehicle explodes, etc.Overall I have to say this is one star above being a stinker, but I think that is totally accidental."
1,What a sequel !,Escape From New York is one of my favorites I keep watching.Butthis so called sequel is just beyond criticism.It really takes great skill and ability to make such a bad movie after 15 years.Congratulations for nothing!
3,IT TOOK 15 YEARS FOR KURT RUSSELL TO REPRISE THIS ROLE,"THIS TIME, SNAKE PLISSKEN RETURNS TO RETRIEVE A BLACK BOX THAT HAS A DETONATION DEVICE. THIS SEQUEL IS MORE OF A REMAKE. IF YOU PAY ATTENTION, YOU'LL REALIZE THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED HERE IS SIMILAR TO THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED IN ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. A GOOD ACTION PICTURE THAT HAS SOME GOOD PERFORMANCES. IF YOU LIKE KURT RUSSELL OR IF YOU JUST LIKE A SHOOT EM UP BANG BANG ACTION MOVIE, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. BUT FOR EVEN BETTER RESULTS, CHECK OUT ITS ORIGINAL FILM, ''ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK''."
3,"If You Watch Closely, You'll Recognize It's A Sequel/Remake","When I first saw this movie, I didn't really like it. But, for some reason, after I watched 'Escape from New York', and rented, 'John Carpenter's Escape from L.A.' I really liked it after all. I guess sometimes to only understand a sequel, is to really watch the original.The main part I recognized about this film was the character development. John Carpenter didn't really think of new characters. He just took people from his original hit, and changed their personalities. In the first one there was a guy named ""Brain"". I didn't really understand his involvement of the film. In 'Escape from L.A.' Pam Grier plays a transvestite, who is similar to ""Brain"".If you really didn't like this movie, but haven't seen the first one. Then I would suggest renting the first one, first. Then see how you feel about the sequel...No guarantees, though!"
3,It all depends on where you escape from,"The problem with this movie is that it forces Snake Plisskin to escape from Los Angeles, a town that doesn't need an earthquake to separate it from the rest of the U.S. Los Angeles jokes - really intimate L.A. jokes - are only funny to Angelinos. The rest of the world is too busy living normal lives to be hip to all the digs this film makes about what is considered the basic L.A. lifestyle. It is a shame, too, because the promise of Plisskin's return was too good to be true. That isn't to say that Carpenter and Russell didn't give it the old community college try, because they did. Nothing is tired or bored in this movie. It's just that the energy is used up in dealing with L.A. and, let's be honest, L.A. has never really been the most interesting city around. New York is good (but it has already been used). I suggest that next time, Snake and his thigh-high boots tries escaping from San Francisco, or Charleston, West Virginia."
2,One of Carpenter and Russell's best!,"I thought this was a good movie, but it's not as good as the original. The only thing I did not like is the computer generated sequences because they look so fake. I was disappointed that the dvd had no other special features, just the trailer. If anyone's a fan of John Carpenter or Kurt Russell as I am, this is the film to have."
3,What Happened in Cleveland?,"Having seen the original ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, I was hoping for a pretty good action adventure film in ESCAPE FROM L.A. What I got was a big disappointed. Basically, ESCAPE FROM L.A. is a mediocre copy of the first movie. The film contains a strain of dark comedy built around a lot of jokes, but I didn't find many of them funny (e.g. the whole ""I thought you were taller"" thing). Russell is good as Snake and Steve Buscimi and Bruce Campbell have some nice roles as supporting players. The sfx aren't too good for a 1996 picture--many of the CGI sequences are so bad they look like the effects of old with the moving screen in the background of the action. The movie also has a very negative view of Christianity and I found that to be somewhat offensive. Overall, ESCAPE FROM L.A. is an okay movie that could have been a lot better; e.g. there could have been a lot more fighting/action scenes. I think they should have made ESCAPE FROM CLEVELAND instead."
4,Escape from LA (Big Orange is a Deportation Center),"In the year 1998, too many Mexicans are jumping the border and crime is continuously increasing. In the year 2000, a terrible earthquake happens separating California from the U.S. coastline. A presidential candidate decides to turn it into a deportation zone to send off illegal immigrants and scum not worthy of living in the country. In 2013, the President's daughter hijacks Air Force Three and sneaks off to the new island once split away from the states. Only one man has the skill for the job to bring her back and return what she has stolen and taken with her. Snake is back! Plisken has once again been hired by the police force of the future to complete an objective for the sake of the President. This time he does it in Los Angeles. 15 years later after New York. Snake Plisken did it once. He can do it again. Good Action Movie! But not as good as the first. Only better special effects and greater quality."
4,Escape from LA,"It's rare for a sequel to be better than the first but here's an example.Kurt Russell is back as Snake Plissken but this time on the other side of the country and with a few familiar faces; Steve Buscemi, Peter Fonda and Valeria Golino to name a few.If you liked the first, you'll definitely like this one."
3,ESCAPE FROM L.A.,"GOOD ACTION FUN !Remake/Sequel of the 1981 super hit ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK...Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is back in this futuristic movie where Los Angeles is the home for the criminals (separared from the U.S. where the ""good guys"" live) and the President's Daughter is missing there with a ""Black Box"" that Snake is forced to recover.Recommended for Carpenter Fans."
2,Another Disappointing Follow-up to a Great Film,"Alas, another diappointing sequel to a wonderful film. I wonder sometimes, why writers take a classic character and reviev them into a role that in no way lives up to the original. If this was all they could come up with for a follow-up, they should never have made it! This film takes a well drwn character and gives him a bad name. Come on...Sake don't surf. I gave this film two stars for being a terrible sequel."
5,Love it!,Got it a day ahead of schedule. I'm one happy customer! Love me some John Carpenter! And some Snake Plisken.
2,"Remake, not a sequel.","Although it was very entertaining seeing Russell reprise his Plissken character, the movie itself was a letdown. Same scenario: Snake captured, injected w/ life-threatening drug, forced to perform for the president, infiltrating former US metropolis that now houses the country's undesirables, escapes just in time, mission accomplished, gets last word, the end. The only thing that was different from its predecessor was the addition of cheesy special effects and campy scenes (Snake on a surfboard, anyone ? Gimme a break!) If this was meant to be some kind of parody of the first film (which is, obviously, farrrrr superior), then Carpenter and Russell succeeded. What were they thinking ??"
2,Old cars,"In my humble opinion, the real stars of this sorry sequal were the cars, e.g. the Corvair, Buscemi's Caddy and Cuervo's 1959 Buick.How often do you get to see a '59 Buick, either in the movies or in real life?"
2,Time waister,Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though!
1,Question,This film isn't exactly the best of Kurt Russell's works. I was wondering does anybody remember which cigarettes Snake smokes at the end of the film ?
1,"God Awful Film, Stick With Escape From NY....","There aren't enough negative words in the English language to adequately describe this film. If you want to see how a lousy sequel mars the image of a great original, look no further.What was John Carpenter thinking when he made this stinker? Not to mention what was Kurt Russel thinking when he read the script...and agreed to star in it!The plot is a pathetic retread of Escape from NY. Every notable plot device from the original is copied here, and copied poorly. The special effects look like they were done by a novice Apple II user and look extremely phony.Skip this waste of celluloid and stick with ""Escape From N.Y."" You won't be sorry."
1,Why must we give even one star?,"Ah, yes. The ""take the easy money and run"" school of film production.Not that Carpenter (or Russell, for that matter) has ever been confused for an artist, but this sort of money-grubbing is below him.File this under ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should.""Not so much a sequel as a remake of the original, without any of the charm or the style that made the original so fascinating. It does have a lovely right-wing political message grafted onto the last few minutes.Released fifteen years after the first film (which should give one an initial clue), audiences stayed away in droves. So should you.Run, don't walk, away. The most insulting sequel to the memory of an original film since ""The Godfather Part III.""There is another question that must be asked- where is the original?"
3,A good B-movie ride while it lasts,"15 years after crafting the low budget comic cult classic Escape From New York, director John Carpenter finally got the budget he needed in this sequel/reworking of the original film. Kurt Russell reprises his role as one eyed badass Snake Plisskin as he is dropped into the island of Los Angeles to seek out the president's daughter. Parts of the film seem more aimed to make a social satire of our dwindling freedom, but sometimes the action gets too incoherent and parts of the film seem uneven. Not to mention that there are times when the film feels rushed, like Carpenter just wanted to get the film over with. Either way though, Escape From L.A. is still a fun B-movie ride with a great comic flair, and the great supporting cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda, Stacy Keach, Cliff Robertson, and B-movie icon Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell make this one of Carpenter's more decent films of late."
5,kiting tips,this dvd gives some good tips on paragliding . I think it is informative and is good to have if you are into paragliding . I would reccomend this to someone who is wondering what paragliding is all about .
4,Paraglider Ground Handling and the Art of Kiting,Great training video. Needs hi wind launch/breaking detail but all else is really good.
1,This guy charges too much....,"What a rip-off. $37 for 44 minutes? One of his other videos is $36 for 36 minutes. A dollar a minute? It is just kiting a glider....not brain surgery. Spend the money taking your wife out to dinner, so she won't gripe at you for spending the day kiting your glider...."
1,3 base error,"This book is so filled with errors that the authors and editor should be ashamed. Some of the more glaring examples: they identify Gene Conley as the only man to play on a NBA and MLB championship team in the same city - Boston. While Conley did play on a world series winner it was the Milwaukee Braves in '57 - not the Boston Braves who left that city in '53. He did play for the NBA winning Celtics a little later. They also state that all world series games were played between 1947 and 1956 in New York City. They fail to remember that the famous Philadelphia Phillies Whiz Kids were in the '50 series. Those are just two of many unpardonable errors which riddle this book. An old fashioned editor with a little knowledge of baseball is needed. I hope Mr. Lyons, esq. is not as sloppy in his legal briefs as he was in compiling this mess."
5,Confusion for excellence,"Okay there is obviously no baseball fans that enter this website. 2 of the above 3 reviewers have absolutely no knowledge of the game. This is a fabulous book. Even though I am a close friend of Mr. Doug Lyons, there is nothing sloppy about this book. I don't know what that ""western reader"" is talking about. This is one of the best researched books I've ever read. It is so interesting and has so many interesting facts in it. Maybe you should give this book another chance, and buy the sequel which is coming out soon. Only real baseball fans get this book. If you are not one, then don't bother!"
4,Happy,"My 16 year old daughter wanted a clipboard , this is her color. She loves it. Service was great , it arrived very quickly. She's happy."
5,Fun!,"Peg Bracken is ALWAYS, ALWAYS fun! You'll gain a few insights - but more importantly, you'll have a great time reading this book. This lady can write!"
4,"not bad, not the best","I am really enjoying the Charlie Moon series of mysteries. Of course they are compared to Hillerman, but Hillerman takes himself very seriously and in contrast the Charlie Moon stories are often quite funny as well as well-imagined. The Shaman's Game is an earlier effort, and the reviewer R.L. (Philadelphia, PA) is correct in saying that Charlie Moon and his girl friends are just annoying - a shuffling shambling naive 7 foot tall aboriginal Jimmy Stewart who just doesn't understand girls. Yuck. However, the rest of the story is pretty good, an unusual plot, loads of interesting characters, fairly good writing. I've noticed that in his earlier books in this series the author uses foreshadowing far too much, in addition to the embarassing love relationships between Moon and every female who approaches him. Just ignore that, you'll find plenty to enjoy in this book."
3,Not a Hillerman Novel,It was ok with plenty of SW native culture but not paced very well. The ending was hardly worth the effort of getting to it. Just sort of petered out.
2,Book,The book is not interesting me at all. the author is compared to Tony Hillerman but I don't see it.
5,GREAT!!!!!,probably the best CD ive heard in 10 years. Every song is hillarious and well-written. Anyone who's ever been connected with a fighter squadron can really appreciate this. I think I may have broken my CD player from playing this over and over again.
5,Hilarious!,"If you know anything about flying fighters you will laugh your cranium off! If you don't know anything about fighters, have a shot of weed and start singing!!!!"
5,A White Stone,"I read this book to my husband on a recent road trip. At times, I couldn't continue reading because of my tears. We couldn't wait to get back in the car to read further!! The beginning of each chapter ""From Our Father's Heart"" is downright profound in its reformed theological content. Even though it is a ""could happen"" kind of book, it is very thought provoking. What a lifechanging journey to read this book and receive its message about living a sold out life to Christ! It has definitely caused us to reevaluate our level of commitment to evangelism in our postmodern world.. Karen"
2,This is NOT a good book!,"This book has a very ""amateur"" feel to it, and needs serious editing. The plot is unrealistic, there are too many characters and plot lines, and the writing often seems incredibly ""preachy"". There is also some sketchy theology in the book, such as a strange interpretation of the parable of the ten virgins where the author says that the Body of Christ and the Bride of Christ are not the same group of people. Overall, I found the book frustrating and annoying. There are MUCH BETTER Christian fiction books out there, don't waste time reading this one!"
1,Awful!,"Sometimes a really bad movie is so bad that it's funny. Not the case here, these are both just plain bad. I'm a fan of Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst, and that is why I bought it. If she had looked more like ""Flopsy"", I would have thrown another star at it. Don't spend more than a dollar on this!"
5,WOW!,"My new favorite brew! Yes, I am somewhat fickle. Unfortunately my tastes seem to match my budget. This fits the bill on both accounts. These are great beans for everyday, strong, robust and not at all bitter. Thanks for offering this one."
3,"Coffee good, shipping bad.","The coffee's taste is quite good, but it arrived open and all over the bottom of the shipping package."
3,Java Trading Company Espresso Jet City Whole Bean,I thought these beans were just ok. Not particularly good and not particularly bad. Still prefer 8 o'clock french roast beans that are a little cheaper.
4,Spilled Beans,"Couldn't wait to receive my coffee and I when I saw the box, swore I could smell the coffee from the driveway. Well, I truly did because the 5 lb. bag had broken inside the shipping box and the beans were loose! I had to hand pick them from the box into a ziplok bag.Wish they had packed the bag securely, otherwise, the coffee is great."
5,great coffee,"I have bought this coffee twice, and I like it so much that I really find it difficult to try anything else. My husband is picky about coffee and loves this one."
4,"Good Coffee, a little bitter though.","This is a great deal on espresso coffee so I went ahead and purchased it a few weeks ago. The beans are very dark, rich and oily which is good for a strong cup of joe. I'm still torn about whether the bitterness is really that bad. It's not like ""Diner"" coffee or anything, it's just not like Costa Rican coffee which has little or no bitterness at all."
3,"Costume is great, but where are the accessories?","We like the costume fine, but the pictured accessories are not included. Yes, there's a note that says the costume only includes the outfit and mask, but if the accessories (goggles, weapon, binoculars) are pictured, one would assume that they would also be for sale, perhaps as a package or individually. They are nowhere to be found. My son is very disappointed. We have had to search all over the web to try to find similar accessories."
1,Swat team Halloween costume,"My son wanted to be a Swat officer for Halloween and this is the one he selected. It was a thin material, so he had to wear sweats under the costume. The mask was cool. But, for the price, I don't know if it was really worth it."
1,Declined to a lemon,"Just as many other reviewers have stated the DVD portion worked fine albeit loud early on; then it slowly got worse. I started to have the same problems as other people have stated where the DVD would pixilate in the middle of a movie. Eventually it would not even load a DVD just give the bad DVD error on screen. I took it to Best Buy and the hooked it up to one of their TVs with no problem. I took it home and hooked it up before putting it back in the entertainment center and it worked. Inside the entertainment center it crapped out again. It maybe a heat issue. That would explain the DVD going out half way through a movie, just as it was heating up. I dunno. Now I'm stuck with $160 paperweight."
2,problematic DVD playback,"I ended up taking back three of these machines (which I regret, because I really wanted to save space with a two-in-one unit). Each one had the same problem, intermittent stuttering and pixilization. It didn't happen a great deal, but not one single DVD would play all the way through without errors. CD's played fine, the VHS unit was very nice -- but the DVD playback was an irritation. A service tech tried to play the ""it's not a bug it's a feature"" game, saying it had something to do with new Macrovision encoding to protect against piracy. Whether he was blowing smoke, or on to something, I do not know. All I know is that all three went back."
3,Returned - not a happy camper,"On the plus side - This unit is attractive, has a lot of nice features and a good price. Set up was easy and on screen commands are logical. The VCR worked well.Reason for return - In addition to annoying pixelation, the first rental DVD jammed twice during regular play. The disc had minor(?) fingerprint marks. After a good cleaning, it performed OK. I made sure the next 2 rentals were cleaned ahead of time. I still had pixelation on both. ""0"" for three did not seem like a very good percentage.I'm now looking at the Panasonic PV-D4762. Nice features, good reviews. Higher price."
1,Beware - Loud Noise playing video,"I bought and returned two of these players within 1 day. It was very easy to set up and fit in the space I had but the noise the video player put out while viewing video's was not acceptable. I'm not talking about the sound all video player make,with the running of gears, I'm talking about a loud buzzing noise that is so distracting you can not enjoy the video. Thinking we just bought a ""bad"" player we returned it and brought home another, SAME THING - the noise is so loud you can not enjoy what your watching. I would NOT recommend this to anyone (I exchanged it for a Sony this time)"
1,DVDs Don't Play Through Without Freezing!,"I've played about 6-7 DVD rentals in this machine that have frozen. (I've tried to rewind to right past the freeze/skip spot, but it's very difficult; if I go right before that spot and hit the Play button, it freezes again and skips to the next scene!) At first, I thought the problem was the DVDs. (I returned them for a rental fee refund.) Then I found out those same DVDs play fine in my other DVD player (a Pioneer model). (And I've cleaned the DVDs to ensure there's not a spot on them.) This is the third Samsung product I've bought that's been defective (the other two were cameras). Never again!"
1,DVD NO GOOD,Bought the machine because I wanted a combo. The VCR and CD plays good but the DVD player does not play a single disc without some kind of glitch. Sent back for repaire was gone for almost a month. Still not fixed. No help from Samsung.Customer satisfaction does not seam to be tops on their list. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
2,AVOID-if you have/want surround sound or high def,"I was considering purchasing this item, but I found a few more drawbacks. My husband eventually wanted to get a surround sound system with all the best speakers and in a few years get a high def. tv. Turns out this model is not compatable to work well with either. There is however a better model (more expensive $250-300) but that has worked wonderfully with his new system. So if you are planning on getting surround sound or a high def. tv go for better model."
3,Remote Confusion,"I have the DVD-V1000 model which is basically the same unit and while it does exactly as advertised as with any ""combo"" type unit the remote control is confusing as hell. It'll play DVD's/CD's, CDRW's and DVD-R's. It wont play DVD+R's/+RW's. It also plays disc's with mp3's and some DVD-RW's...your mileage may vary;-} . Stick a blank tape in the vhs slot while a dvd is in the disc slot hit record on the vcr side and whalla!! you've recorded however long of a logo screen that says Samsung and nothing else. Overall it's a good dvd and vcr but all in ones are a pain."
2,"Quality Picture, Noisy Unit","Like a lot of reviews before me, my experience was with a noisy DVD drive. It chirps, It whirrs, It whines. This DVD/VCR Combo needs a muffler. The VCR worked just great, though. No complaints there. Also...I did NOT like the remote. Buttons are too small and you have to point it RIGHT AT the unit for the signal to work. I bought one, took it back and I think this newer one is even noisier than the first. I'm taking it back again and getting a Sony."
5,I think it's great !!!!,"Not sure why others had problems, I think it's great. Consumer Reports just rated it number 1 in it's category. I found it easy to set up and use. No weird sounds, great picture quality."
2,"Decent, but pixelation on track change","Great idea in theory, but similar to review by Dean d ""....I took the first one back the next day because sometimes when the tracks on the dvd switched, the screen would pixelate and skip part of a scene. This did not happen regularly. But it was very noticeable and happened several times during the movie. I am takeing our second one back today. Hopefully, third times a charm.... ""I have already brought one back. I'm thinking about throwing in the towel on this one. I do like most of the other features, however it's not made with usability in mind.Not recommended if you have any sort of faith in technology. =)"
1,Do not buy - probable design defect,"I received the V-2000 as a gift. The first unit I had performed well for a few days. Then, when a DVD disc was about halfway through, the picture would freeze for about 3-5 seconds and then continue. It would do this every 30 seconds or so! Very annoying. It was not the disc because the freezing would occur on any disc I tried. We exchanged the unit for another. After about a week, we had the same problem. I talked to Samsung and they admited that they have been getting a lot of calls about this problem and all but conceded that there may be a problem with the model. We exchanged the unit for the Panasonic 4762 which in my opinion is a better product anyway. The place we purchased these from (a national electronics dealer) also said that many of the Samsungs were coming back. Choose something different!"
1,Unit loses power while playing DVD's,"I've had this unit for about 4 months. The VCR works fine, but about 2/3rds of the way through a DVD the entire unit shuts off. It's very annoying. It didn't happen when it was first purchased, but it happens all the time now. ..."
1,Very poor VCR recording--worse than my 16-year old Hitachi!,"I bought this unit thinking I would be upgrading my 16-year old (!) VCR, and working my way into DVD with one convenient unit. First disappointment: there is no LP setting on the VCR--something I consider basic, even with my ancient Hitachi unit (which works great, though the sound quality when tapes are played back on other units is bad). Second disappointment: even on the SP setting, the recordings were just horrible--grainy, worse than my old VCR recordings even on the lowest setting quality. I think this is a poor union of products--others have commented on the bad DVD playback. Samsung has work to do. I'm returning this today. The only positive thing--shopping at Amazon is great. They are making it very easy for me to send this back, and I will continue to try to find a good product. But more research is in order--and I'm not sure that any of these 2-in-1 units is up to par in quality."
3,Ok....Sometimes,"I've had this unit for about 8 months. I've had very few problems with dvd skipping or anything like that. My VCR portion works fine. But recently, I've been having a problem with this thing actually reading dvd's. It stopped reading dvd's a few weeks ago. However, since I was still under the manufacturer's 1 year warranty, I called Samsung, and they gladly offered to replace/fix my broken unit in less than 14 days upon them receiving my current one. According to UPS, I'm supposed to be getting it in tomorrow....let's hope it works!"
1,What a lemon !,I got this unit because Consumer Reports rated it highly and I thought a combo unit would suit me because I rarely have time to watch movies. Either they were totally wrong or I got a lemon. I played 3 movies and the VCR ate all 3 ! I promptly took this piece of junk back. I did not even bother to test the DVD.
1,Pure Junk,"Well, I bought it. Shame on me, because I read the problems with it here and on epinions as well. Good thing I tested it right when I got it, and didn't just wait to give it to my parents for Christmas. I exchanged it to make sure that it wasn't just a random thing, but the second unit was [bad] as wellProblems w/DVD:Extremely Loud. Starts off like a whine, then intermittenly switches to a clicking sound. It doesn't affect the sound or picture, but it sounds like a computer just humming and clicking away in the background.Problems w/VCR:Same thing, just an overly annoying loud device. The fast forward [is loud] as well.Unless your hard of hearing, stay away from this product! I reccomend it to nobody! I hope someone really believes me, it will save them time and frustration."
1,Help me please,"I need information around DVD multizone, I need work with zone 1 and zone 4 Latin american movies"
3,Academic studies on special ops,"A detailed look at special forces in Canada and in the Canadian military. Presents American, British, Canadian and German authors who present theories on special ops, historical examples from other countries' experiences and conjecture on the future of special military operations.Theoretical work. Academic, dry, university publication."
2,Stop the Ultimate Sacrifice review! Enough already!,"Every book reviewed on Amazon about JFK has this idiotic review that ""while this book is good Ultimate Sacrifice is the best ever."" Do you think,Vince, that you could stop putting your so-called review to every book in the catalogue? Your review is meaningless and it's irritating to see it stuck on every book. So give it a rest."
2,Disappointed,"Seems like the only ghosts the author chased were the ones that made him feel like more than a ""common man"". The author told about several important people calling him but he told very little of their conversations with him. I can't imagine receiving the calls he did and only having a 2 minute conversation. it seems that even the author is trying to ""cover up"". I am still not sure what really happened and reading this book will definitely not make things any clearer."
1,Marketing Ploy Extirpated,"Of course the average customer rating for this item is 5 stars - there is only ONE review, and it was obviously written by someone with more than a connoisseur's interest in the success of this product. I have no expeirence with the Samsung DVD-S321 DVD Player. For all I know it may be spectacular and more than worthy of its 5 star rating, but that should be decided by actuall customers and not venal marketing dregs."
5,The Newest/Greatest thing on the market yet!,i beleive this dvd player will out perform all others in its class with its sleek styling and beautiful design this player should soar above all others and look down with pity on the competion.
2,You have to be lucky,"It seems some persons are lucky and receive the noiseless version, this problem si not only with the S321 it happens with other Samsung models too. I opened the player and found that the problem is that the DVD wobles up/down hitting the lens and producing the horrible sound that varies the pitch depending on the part of the movie you are at, I have found no way of fixing it. If you, for some strange reason want to get this player, try it in the shop before leaving to make sure it doesnt make ""the noise"""
1,Extremely Noisy,The DVD player itself seems to be very good in quality but it makes a screeching noise while it plays all DVDs. If you keep your volume really loud during playback you'd be fine...otherwise the noise is enough to annoy you.I returned this player and bought a Panasonic and couldn't be happier.
1,piece of junk,"I have one and it broke after the first year. After reading the posts, it looks like that's pretty much par for the course. Buyer beware!"
5,Great dea.,"I bought it for my girlfriend. Prior to this I got her a chi, which only lasted a month. Hella satisfied. Thanks a bunch."
2,Jessica Simpson's Fancy Love perfume,"I don't think this is the genuine product. I think it is one of those ""like"" perfumes. There is no information on the bottle re: manufacturer, distributor, etc., and the perfume stays with you a very short time, regardless of how much or how often I use it."
4,Better than our BaByliss,"This iron replaced a BaByliss that we've had for a few years. It definitely seems to smooth the hair more and there are fewer ""stray"" hairs that stick out. The iron glides over my daughter's thick but fine hair (at top temp) and she has noticed that at her end, the iron does not seem as hot and threatening. We went from the 1.5 inch to the 1 inch even though her hair is long. I find it easier to handle and to get to the roots, with no negative impact (I thought you needed a bigger iron the longer the hair). As well, the BaByliss seemsto catch and pull the hair while the ProIonic does not. Quite happy with this purchase..."
5,Nice product,I am using this straightener for over 2 years. I am really enjoying. Still working as a new one. No regrets. Definitely will recommend it.
4,Works Great Great Price,I saved about $100.00 buying it here. I first encountered this flat iron at the salon I normally go to. Luckily I did not buy from them and checked out Amazon saving me a lot of money. Go for it one of the best flat iron on the market coming from a girl with very curly hair.

5,about time!,"not having yet read more than a few pages of mr. graeber's work, i can already wholeheartedly agree with him when he says it is the only readable book on the subject."
1,disappointed,"dvd won't play, says something about being from the ""wrong region""rather disappointed about buying a product and finding out it doesn't work"
1,Doesn't Play,"Bought it a couple months ago. Tried to watch it the other day and the dvd is not recognized by any game system, computer or dvd player."
1,not playable on my DVD players,I didn't realize there were foreign versions that are not playable on any of my DVD players. Learned something new every day.
2,Very Disappointed,I love this movie so much but I spent 14 dollars on a movie I cant even watch because of the darn region code. Granted I should have paid more attention to that but its very frustrating.
2,Not the girl I want.,This used to be my favourite movie.Then I became aware of the comic book.I'm now searching for a new favourite movie.END OF STORY.
4,Fun film,"This movie is a departure from the graphic novel in some ways, and that is a problem for some people, but not for me. Movies never take everything from their source material, so this movie is actually pretty decent on its own.I didn't really like the casting for Tank Girl. I'm not slamming the actress chosen for the role, but the character of Tank Girl called for someone with more spunk, and Lori just doesn't quite cut it. The story itself is decent, though, and I liked the short animated sequences, they added some punch to the film. Overall enjoyable, I'd grade it a B, at least."
3,Tank Half Full,"This film has alot to recommend but also contains deficiencies. Lori Petty is kinetically bubbly as the title character and her energy carries throughout the entire film. Malcolm McDowell taps into his Alex DeLarge malevolence and creates a memorably villainous head of a Water and Power consortium. Naomi Watts, a brunette no less, impresses even though she's essentially riding shotgun to Petty. And those Kangaroo Men are way cool! The downside here is that the film seems to be more artifice than art. The art direction is way too busy. The grunge rock soundtrack is headache inducing. The jumping back and forth between live action, animation, and comic strips is equally jarring. ""Tank Girl"" is an interesting film without being wholly successful."
1,[One and a half stars] Surprisingly poor effort for Lori Petty film-,"Petty was very good as Tyler Endicottin Point Break, but she isnot to blamefor this poor futuristic film / splicedcomic strip animation about liberatorof future dictatorship. Dave Carradine'screw does better with Warlords, Wizardsof the Lost Kingdom and Future Force mov-ies! Petty is still a hottie but this pro-ject simply sucks! Bring back Traci Lordsin Circuitry Man, or Circuitry Man II!"
1,'Tank' Needs to Explode,"The year is 2033. Who cares? It hasn't rained in over a decade and everybody is thirsty. Wow, then there would be nothing left of human civilization right? A company called Water and Power is controlled by Malcolm McDowell. It's up to a noisy woman who calls herself ""Tank Girl"" to stop the madman. Lori Petty plays the most annoying woman in the world and she needs to vanish. I wish I had the 'Clapper' to turn off the movie. Put that thing to good use. There were a lot of mutants running around in this piece of trash called the Rippers. Yeah, that's great. No! Who in the world would like this movie? It's insanely ugly! I thought I was going crazy after fifteen minutes had passed in this horrible mess."
2,Started Out Great,"The opening scenes, including the torturing of a defiant Tank Girl by evil Malcolm McDowell, were fantastic and great fun; then it all goes downhill FAST. It's almost as if they'd switched directors and writers after a half hour, when the film crests creatively: then Tank Girl inexplicably starts performing onstage; and from this point on TANK GIRL's a loser. The film just plain limped home.The writers shot their creative wad on the opening scenes, then left town; whoever took over the helm played up the campy side in the lamest, most unimaginative way. It never recovered. A major disappointment. And I liked Lori Petty as TG too; it just went NOWHERE!"
3,"Entertaining and funny, but it needs more.","This movie is pretty funny. But since it was based on an already popular graphic novel illustrated by Jaime Hewlett (who also drew the Gorillaz), fans were greatly dissapointed. Tank Girl was originally Australian, but Lori Petty plays her like some tough new yorker chick. I really didn't like the special effects makeup of the kangaroo people, known in the movie as the Rippers. They were really cute in the comic, but looked really creepy in the movie. So, in closing in my review, I have one more thing to say that I'm sure all other Tank Girl fans would agree with. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THE WHOLE MOVIE ANIMATED!!!!!!!! It would have done a whole lot better."
3,"Amusing Story, Smokin' Hot Villain!","Hear ye, hear ye! Malcolm McDowell proves downright luscious in ""Tank Girl"" - when doesn't he - but the story is moderately bearable, having amusing characters and outrageous costumes. One thing I wasn't happy with was the fact that there. are. absolutely. NO extra features aside from trailers, which was extremely disappointing!!!! I know that there must be outtakes and interviews somewhere, but why they weren't included on the DVD remains a mystery worthy of Mulder and Scully."
5,Movie,"I like the movie, the product came new and fast and Lori Petty and Naomi Watts give a great performance"
4,"Man, I don't know why this movie didn't do better..","In the theatres. You have two wonderful strong female roles, a witty script and just a lot of odd ball fun. I love the spontaneous song, and seeing Malcolm McDowell as a psychotic villian was great! I love this show!"
3,a good flick - if you're in the right frame of mind,"The first time I saw Tank Girl was in a high-energy party setting, with a very enthusiastic friend. I laughed the whole way through and loved it. The second time I watched it was in a much calmer setting, and it didn't have quite the same effect. I think it's a great movie if you're in the mood for something silly; you just have to let go of all credibility and enjoy it. I wouldn't reccomend it for viewing if you're not in a kind of hyper mood, or for anyone over 25."
4,Its a great fun easy going film,"Allthough the original has been ""cut"" there is still enough to enjoy this film. The anime sequences are amusing and hold the film together. It is an amusing look at a world that has no ""water"" which in its self is unique as most films within this genre are ""Post Apocalyptic""Watch this film !!!"
2,"Poor DVD features, decent story","....As for the movie, it's fun, she's a cool frisky chic, she looks like Gwen Stefani with a tank. The comic was better, but the movie was funny, albeit very similiar to being a Girl Mad Max. Malcom McDowell, Ice-T, and Lori Petty are in it.Two stars for the movie, could be higher if the DVD had more on it."
5,Excellent!,I've been so impressed with this line of pastas that it's has driven all others out of the house. You would truly never know it's not white flour pasta.

4,Good mystery book for animal lovers,"This is the first Nevada Barr book I've read. I enjoyed it immensely. The story requires a good amount of ""suspension of disbelief,"" but this didn't detract from the story. The animal-lover in me found the ending to be deeply satisfying."
2,Not her best,"As other reviewers have already stated, this book had many editing errors and errors in fact. That was disappointing. But so was the story line. At best, the ending was far-fetched and a disappointment. The characters seemed less well-developed than those in past books. I've read all of her books and this is the first I would not recommend. Let's hope the next is better."
3,Blood Lure is a HUMAN mystery...,"The back cover reflects a bear problem, big bears, big problem, lots of scary stuff. OK, so one lady is the victim, and the whole book reflects the pursuit of her killer. No big bears that rampage the town, eat hikers, whatever, just a murder mystery. A good read, it's still just a murder. I wanted bears...LOTS of bears!! Personally, they scare me to death, and I wanted a bump-in-the-night thriller. I'll read more Nevada Barr, but be prepared."
4,A Good Old Fashioned Mystery,"Park ranger Anna Pigeon has been sent to Glacier National Park to be a part of the Bear DNA Project. The adventure begins when the researcher's camp is destroyed in the middle of the night by a bear. Elsewhere in the park a woman is found dead. Anna fires up her little gray cells to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together. Following the clues in this mystery is like watching a drama behind a filmy curtain. You think you know what is going on, but you can't be sure until the curtain is finally removed. As always, Barr's talent for describing landscapes brings the reader right into the story's setting. Even if you've never been in a wilderness, you are bound to feel a connection here. A few errors in punctuation and sentence structure, mentioned by another reviewer, are troublesome at times. But these errors are easily forgiven because the story is just so very entertaining."
2,Not her best,"As other reviewers have already stated, I was disappointed with the editing and factual errors in the book. Worse, though, was the story line, particularly the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will say that I thought it a trick ending and far-fetched (although you could see at least part of it coming).I've read all of her books and enjoyed them...until this one."
3,Not Barr's Best,"As a frequent visitor to National Parks and an avid mystery reader, I have enjoyed all of Nevada Barr's books. Perhaps my familiarity with and love of Glacier NP caused me to find the plot a little absurd. Another reviewer mentioned the errors in the book, and I would like to comment on that, too. I was especially disappointed to see the USGS - the United States GEOLOGICAL Survey, referred to as the United States Geographical Survey, on page 5. While I know the book is fiction, that kind of error calls into question the other presumably factual information. These faults aside, the mystery itself was captivating and the characters believable. There were many clues and red herrings to keep the suspense alive until the end."
3,Well-told Tale and an enjoyable read,"After promising to look up other work by Nevada Barr in my review of `Women On The Case', I picked up `Blood Lure'. The premise sounded interesting: Anna Pigeon on loan to Glacier Nat'l Park to do a study on grizzly bears runs into murder most foul on the camp trail.Barr's description of the natural beauty and the natural world are full-colored and vibrant. She makes grizzly bear DNA research downright interesting.Her plotting is crafty indeed, her story trail strewn with misleads and false starts, and thirty pages from the end you're still not exactly sure who the murderer is.Most of her characters are well-developed and fully-fleshed. Others are less so, but that's the art of the lure---how much do we know about these characters and should we bother or not?Although I'm not entirely happy with the ending, the tale is well-told and is an enjoyable read.But I wouldn't advise bringing it on a camping vacation."
2,Good bear info but contrived chore of a mystery novel,"A good book to read if you are headed to Glacier National park and want practical tips on hiking in bear country. Anna Pigeon is the main character. She is a smart, self assured woman who can be manipulated by the stigmas of political correctness yet clever enough to fend off her adversaries. As a mystery novel the summation is contrived and the pace of the work makes a chore of the reading."
3,"Blood Lure, Almost Good",What can I say. It was almost good. A circus bear-that's the puch line? come on...
3,Blood Lure,Fanciful story about the beautiful Glacier Park and bears that added drama to my life for a day. Enjoyed the book and I am looking forward to reading another Nevada Barr book.
4,A delightful and educational look at Glacier National Park,"Anna Pigeon returns in BLOOD LURE, as she take time away from her regular park duties to assist with bear DNA studies at Glacier National Park. Right at the beginning, we, along with Anna, learn the best (or worst, depending on your point of view) recipes to lure bears. (I must admit this isn't the first time Barr has presented me with more information than I care to learn about a particular subject.) Also, the description of the bear attack on Anna's research group is chilling and enough to make me forget any ideas I'd ever had about going camping!Barr unravels her clues carefully and fairly; the reader has ample opportunity to put everything together (along with Anna) to solve the mystery. Yet the clues weren't blatantly obvious. Barr did a terrific job with her plotting on this book, and she deserves a pat on the back. BLOOD LURE is well worth reading. Thumbs up!"
4,Bear Sanctuary at Glacier National Park,"A pleasant way to get learn about brown bears and Glacier National Park, which is shared by both Montana and British Columbia. Armchair outdoor lovers will learn about DNA profiling of the grizzlies in the park for ongoing scientific study, a study we assume is happening in reality as well as in the book.The plot leads us from fear of the ""grizzly"" inhabitants to a better understanding of bear behavior. To do this however, a few parts of the story became a bit contrived, with bear behavior easier to follow than human behavior and reaction.Enjoyable and enlightening reading, nevertheless, featuring Ann Pigeon, intrepid ranger."
2,Bearly a quality book,I have read many of Anna Pigeon books. This is my least favorite. The mystery is not developed and thought about which Nevada Barr usually does well. This was more of a book on bear/human relationship and a mystery (small) thrown in. I did not enjoy it like and it was more of a chore to read it. I highly suggest Superior Death or Endagered Species. These two are Nevada Barr's best books.
1,Ridiculous book,"My first Nevada Barr read and I was highly disappointed. Perhaps her earlier books are better, but I doubt I will ever find out. The only reason I read this one is because I worked in Glacier National Park for a summer and was very familiar with the area as well as bears. Now, as for Anna Pigeon, I found her reaction to bears lacked credibility. Here is a seasoned ranger who simply doesn't respond properly during a bear encounter. PUH-lease! Don't waste time on this one. I also agree with another reviewer--I LIVED there and the map made virtually no sense to me."
1,This book was lame...,"This book had all the nuance and insight of a poorly scripted comic book. Written from the perspective of an extremly anal, painfully politcally correct and smug female forest ranger. The male characters are all weak charactered and pathetic stereo types and lack any soul what so ever and the female characters are all treated as if they (particularly the main character Anna) are somehow superior to all the males around them as a rule. Macho female characters and weak, spineless male characters and terribly hard to swallow coincedences make this barely believable book a big fat flop. This book book seems like it was was written to appeal to women who hate men, and at the same time want to be one. This book deserves zero stars but there's no choice for that."
2,Not very suspensful with unrealistic ending,"I am a huge fan of Nevada Barr and couldn't wait for this book to come out in paperback. Out of all books in this series, I found this one to be definitely lacking in suspense and found the ending to be laughably ridiculous. Hopefully her next installment will be better. Honestly though, Anna Pigeon is getting really old and maybe she should think about hanging up the towel."
3,Blood Lure,"Wow, this took me almost 3 months to read. Definitely not a late night book. Barr usually keeps me on the edge of my seat, but not this time. I've read 90% of the Anna Pigeon series and I'm sorry to say this was very disappointing. To long to get into to meat of the story, to much bear tracking info unless you're a bear junkie. Still love the way she describes the parks, always makes me want to take a road trip. Anna just seemed lost while she put the pieces together. Gave it a 3 Star but only because Anna is my favorite ranger cop."
1,Don't bother!!!,The shipping side perfect no complaints the book excellent condition so no complaints with seller. Book it self has a lot of gaps as to what to do misses bits and isn't as detailed as others of it's kind so honestly buy from a different guide source!!!!!!!!
2,"Helpful sometimes, other times not so much","This guide is good most of the time but there are parts of it that are totally wrong. Lots of time it'll tell you to kill the guard and collect his gun. Only there is no gun there. This is either a problem with the game or with the book. There are so many bugs with the game it is hard to tell. Anyway, both the game and the book are terrible. Eidos should be embarrassed."
1,excuse me,"OK, I don't care if it's the most beautiful guitarist I've ever heard playin' on this piece of vinyl waste by-product. VELVET DARKNESS is a materpiece compared to this.........bad lounge act.Yeah, it's collectible on vinyl all right. For reasons beyond my collectible sense. Guess what? This album is absoluetly dreadful.I had to actually give it 1 star for it to accept my review but I take the star back.WARNING - Listen to it before you buy it! I think you'll agree with me."
1,Breaks fast,After only two uses it wouldn't play anymore. Since both uses were without incident (no drops or water contact) I can only assume that the player is not build very well.
3,Meh...,"Alright, good things first...Very Small, Very Cool, Easy to use.Bad things...Some songs make the mp3 player turn off...It always starts at the first song and in a default volume.there is no looping sequence from the last song to the first...so.. all in all... it's a good mp3... it just needs a little bit of tweeking."
1,Fragile & unreliable!,"I bought the Muvo from J&R. Had to return it for replacement because it broke when I touched the fast forward buttons. The Muvo is a very fragile product. The second Muvo had other problems which I am dealing with currently. The rechargeable Ni-Metal Hydyride batteries only last 5 minutes with Muvo after the batteries are fully recharged. I bought a new charger and four new AAA Ni-Metal Hydride batteries and the problems continue. Bottomline: I am very unhappy with Muvo. I tend to think that Creative Labs has not tested its product properly before it brought Muvo to the market. I also read at the CNET site that people had similar problems with Muvo, so my problems do not seem unusual for this product."
1,Dies in 1 Month,"This is a very good WMA and mp3 player. On the train, I use this to listen to radio shows from Hong Kong downloaded from the Internet. It holds hours of music or talk shows.But this MUVO doesn't work within a month.I bought 2 of these.The first one stopped working in 2 weeks (bought that in 11/02)The second one was bought 12/27/02, and exactly a month later,today 1/27/03, it stopped working.The memory card still works. But it refuses to light up when I press on button. It refuses to play music."
5,my favorite workout buddy,"I've read a lot of people had some technical problems with theirs but all I know is I love mine. I bought it for the gym and it's perfect for that. It's so light and comfortable to wear I almost literally don't notice I'm wearing it, it's like I've got a private dj beaming my music into my head while I exercise. I even like the ear buds. They may not be the world's greatest headphones but they fit my ears really well and provide sound which is perfectly adequate for my needs. I'm not an audiophile and I could care less if the sound is ""awesome"" as long as I have my music in a lightweight, trouble-free package. add to the nice packaging that downloading is a snap (I'm running windows XP), and you can't beat it. If you're looking for a jukebox type MP3 or need lots of features, perfect sonic clarity etc, look elsewhere, but if simplicity and size are you criteria, this is it."
4,Solid player after having 30 days,"I read all the reviews and decided to purchase MuVo 128 for $130 on Amazon over the $200 Nike player. Granted, the player doesn't feel as solid as Nike's, but it was extremely easy to use (had no problems like some users) and much smaller. I jump rope and do weights, and this player didn't miss a beat. The only minor nuances:-I couldn't use MusicMatch where I organize my mp3s. You need to find it on your hard drive.-Doesn't have a lock button where the buttons don't function. It never accidentally pushed buttons, but I'd take the battery out before packing it.-No belt clip included. It's so small I put it in my pocket or tied it through my short waist-string without problems, but some might think it's annoying.Overall, a very good product that I'll definitely keep."
1,broke in 6 months and had a terrible time with support,"well, I bought the Muvo in late 2002 for my son.within 3 months, problem occurred. We managed to useit and repair it (reformat, download new drivers)for another 3 months. But, eventually, it just can'teven be power on.Called Creative Lab support, they said it's exceeded the3-month limited warranty. In the hope that they willfind the problem and theirconscience, I sent them the broken device and 20 dollarsexamination fee.The result came back ""It can't be powered on. If youwant to replace it, please pay an extra 75 dollars"".I was mad as hell.In a fury, I canceled my 20 dollars Credit cardbill -- and they didn't contest that. But I still missedthe 9 dollars I spent on Fedex shipping. And I missedthe $150 floppy drive that I could have kept myself (I learnedthat I may be able to use the broken MP3 player as afloppy drive by reading the reviews on this website).I will never buy anything from Creative Lab."
3,"Nomad Muvo, low battery life",I was never able to get the battery life that the specs say (which is why I purchased this one).. Most of the time I got around 20 minutes.. I tried Lithium batteries but was worse.When working is great!
1,Wheh it works,Worked great until the on/off button just stopped working.I find out on the net that I am not the only one with same problem.Crative has ignored all my emails.I recommend this item only if you want an MP3 player that will last about ninety days before you need another one.
1,ITS CHEAPER AT CIRCUIT CITY,The thing is cheaper at the circuit city website. That's all I have to say about it.
2,Poor battery life,2.5 stars really. Not a bad player but there are better ones out there. The 128Mb gives a reasonable no. of songs but recording at low res makes for disappointing playback. Using alkaline batteries this unit has no where near the 12 hours it claims. It is a handy USB drive however and that part of it has helped me out in many urgent work situations.
2,Not Worth it.,"I got this as my first mp3 player, and yes, I'll admit that it worked beautifuly for the first two weeks, however, with me changing my playlist daily - it didn't work beautifuly for long.It was the second week that the volume buttons began sticking, so I couldn't move the volume up and down. I went to the store, thinking it was a default one, and exchanged it for a new one (thank god I didn't have to pay), and the pattern repeated.I kept using it with stuck volume buttons, but another two weeks later the playback button started to stick and stopped playing at all, in other words, these things have a lifespan of about 2 weeks, it's cheaper in the end to get a more expensive one."
2,get the firmware!,"I've had my muvo for 3 months and 21 days. I've not used it too much but I think the battery life is pants, I've listened for a max 4 hours and I'm on to my 3rd longlife battery :(I've had the same experiences of those who had it lock up / not work. I thought it was a bit dodgey to use the play button to turn it off as well as on...I've just been to the nomad website - not the creative one, as this has the firmware update and the new format program. read the instructions, it the most barking setup for upgrading the firmware I've ever seen. anyhow, it's working now and I'll only know if it works after a few days use :)fingers crossed. anyone want to bet on it ?I'm not buying creative EVER again. put off for lifewritten by a thirty something IT network manager with disposable cash that's not going their way"
1,Avoid it like the plague,"I'm just returning my second unit. I used the first one 4 times and the second 3 before they completely broke down. I'm really disappointed...it's such a cool product. I so easy to use and the sound quality is good, if you use better headphones. The ones that come with it sound really tinny and there's no bass boost or adjustments on the player.The 1st problem I had was loud, screechy static. I thought it was just a corrupt file so I formattd it and copied new music to it. It worked fine for an hour or so then started w/the static again. trying to skip the song that wasn't playing caused it to shut down and I was never able to power it up completely.The 2nd unit worked fine through 2 uses and then shut itself off and would not allow me to restart it.I'm not willing to give it a 3rd try, since I did not even get a full week of use out of the 1st 2 units! I've exchanged for a Sony Minidisc player instead. They should pull this thing off the market."
1,79 days into warranty,"I got this for my girlfriend for Xmas. Failed!!!!! doesnt turn on. USB drive still works. What a piece...gotta contact Creative Labs ASAP, its sunday today, so i have to call monday or tues. and pray i can get a hold of them before the 90 days ends.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,the mp3 does not work after two months,"I bought this for friend. Only after 2 months, the MP3 player does not work. Now it can only be used as flash memory."
2,Broke after 4 months,"The player was great for the first 4 months, then it just stopped working. It wouldn't play and my computer would no longer recognize it when connected by USB. I used it running with general workout wear and tear. The warranty is only 3 Months. I would not recommend it until the product becomes more reliable."
1,Refused to work after only a month,I have had this player slightly more than a month and coincidentally just past the warranty period. It will still accept files as an auxilliary drive but will not play on its own. The light does not come on and the the only audible sound is a high buzzing noise. It is incredibly sensitive and not worthy of a name like nomad. I am incredibly disappointed with this product and will never buy anything from Creative Labs again. I would seriously investigate other alternatives.
1,Nice while it lasted,"I guess I should consider myself lucky as I got a good year out of my muvo. As I read the reviews of this player I realize I am SOL because, like many of the other reviewers, mine won't power up anymore. Save your money folks. I have a bunch of creative products but this is product isn't worth the aggrevation. I can only hope they got better with the newer models. I guess being an ""early adopter"" I should expect a clunker every now and then."
2,I posted in October about this one,well I did try a few things and the thing seems to be working again after I had given up on it. I downloaded the latest firmware from the website and also reformatted it. Now its working again so I'm crossing my fingers to see how long this one will last again.
2,Great for running!,"This player is great for size and ease of use! Its' design is simplistic and lightweight. No cables or mess when transferring music. I use it for running and it's even gotten wet! (Rains alot here in Hawaii) However, it does not playback all the songs I have uploaded to it. It randomly skips over the same certain songs every time I play it. And the play is not continuous. It will stop at the same points every time. I simply have to push ""play"" again for it to work but this gets annoying. So if you don't care about these things and you want a lightweight, durable and simple unit, then this one is for you. I don't mind its imperfections and so I'm pretty happy with it."
1,Stay away from Creative Labs!,This MP3 player broke after four months of light use; Creative Labs customer support consumed a great deal of time and energy and finally failed to stand behind their product. I will never again purchase anything made by Creative Labs.
4,Pretty freaking cool,"My MUVO is cool as heck. The reason I like it is that I'm in college and I can slip it into my shirt pocket when I'm at the gym and when I'm walking to class. Being at Clemson which has become very technologically advanced, I use computers for about 2-4 hours a day. This MUVO makes writing CD's and using disks absolete for anything under 128MB. Only downside is kinda short battery life (which doesnt matter if used as flash drive) and no display. Thats why i gave 4 instead of 5. LATA"
4,Perfect starter and excercise MP3 player,"This is my first mp3 player, and it was the perfect starter. I didn't want something too fancy, or too expensive, and I am happy as a clam now. The Muvo is small, compact, easy to use. It does not have a lot of frills, but I wasn't looking for that. It fits in any pocket, or around my neck perfectly. I can run with it, and nev er even think twice about it. The triple A battery is not such a big deal, although it would be nice if it was rechargable. For ...[an undisclosed dollar amount], i don't think you can go wrong."
1,Muvo reconsidered,"I've now had some experience with my second Muvo and found that both units:* will not play some .wma files that MS Media Player and MusicMatch will play - the Muvos power themselves down at the same spots.* Both Muvos have shown signs of corrupting their flash memory - the common one being self labotomization: the flash area with files may look ok, but the Muvo will no longer power on. You must go through a special hard format procedure that restores the Muvo firmware and hard formats the flash memory.Finally there is a major misfeature in the Muvo. When powered off the Muvo always returns to the first song. With no random play function this means that you will listen to the first 30 min to 1 hour of music over and over again unless you do a lot of button pressing.I think the Muvo is a great idea, but the execution and quality should rule it out for now."
1,"Do NOT buy this! For many, it fails out of the box...","I received the MuVo 128 for Christmas. It worked great until just after the 90-day warranty expired. The power/play button locked up and would not power off. After pressing each of the buttons to try to unfreeze it, I finally had to resort to pulling the memory stick/player out of its battery case. After numerous emails to Creative's tech support and following their instructions, it still does not work. When I asked to escalate the trouble ticket, they chose to ignore me and closed the ticket. I replied to let them know how dissatisfied I was and that if someone didn't contact me by June 1, 2003 that I would begin contacting consumer watchdog reporters. No response. Currently, I preparing documentation and compiling negative customer reviews...to submit to a reporter who has contacted me. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT! ..."
3,Okay,"This, is an okay, basic MP3 Player. I found that this product has amazing sound quality, and easy accesibility. On the other hand, this unit can only store about 15-20 songs. I think that this is an okay buy, but if you have the money, go for something bigger. I had to pick and choose which songs I want on it. It has a fast transfer rate, but if you have a big audio collection, this is not the Mp3 Player for you."
1,Small but very unreliable,Just like what the other people have posted. This product is very unrealiable. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Then it got to the point where you're unable to turn in off(I have to remove the batteries to power it off). And then one day it just stop playing. And the warranty just expired last month.There are other products out there; don't waste your money on this. I'm currently back to my old Compaq Ipaq; Still deciding whether I should get iRiver or Digitalway.
1,Quite Working After Warranty Period,"I really loved this product . . . till it just quit working after about four months. I didn't drop it . . . I didn't work out with it or sweat on it (I used it while going for walks). I thought I just had bad luck until I read the other reviews here. It appears that Creative Labs shipped this product with some of the worst quality control ever.Well, it worked with me . . . once. ..."
1,Serious QC Problems,"Do not buy Creative lab products. After contacting customer service multiple times about a warranty item, I talked to one of their techs, who said that they estimate 10% product failure on their products. My options were to pay to have it fixed, with another 10% chance that the repair could fail, or get the broken part back. They do not stand up behind their products. Don't throw your money away."
1,While it worked,"Worked great until one day the on/off button stopped working.On the net I find out I am not the only one with the same exact problem.Creative has, to date, ignored all my emails.Buy this only if you are in the market for an MP3 player that will work for approxiamtely 90 days; the convenient length of the warranty."
2,Not bad not good..but I wouldn't buy it if i had known,"Sound Quality: Really awesome until it stops working for no apparent reason. Also if the batteries are not new, sometimes it just produces gibberish sounds whenever it wants.Design : Not bad, but no lcd, no id3 tags, nothing visualReliability: not reliable at all..i was very impressed with it but after 3 weeks it just started to produce some scratchy sounds during wma playback. MP3 playback is better.Cost: A little expensive compared to rivals.Overall: There are better alternatives....just stay away for safety. But if you are going to take a risk, it really has an awesome sound quality."
1,Unreliable product - junk,"The idea behind the Muvo is great, but the execution stinks. I've owned two over the past 12 months, both of which simply stoped performing mid stream. I was able to get one replaced after numerous calls to tech support to figure out why the device simply would not play. We'd get it started, it would work for several weeks, then simply stop and refuse to play.There appear to be fundamental flaws in both the the design and production of this device. The hassle to keep it operating simply is not worth the effort.In short, this device is a piece of junk..."
1,unreliable,I recently purchased the 128 MB Nomad MuVo MP3 player from Amazon.com. The First player stopped working after three days. Amazon.com replaced it promptly. The replacement player stopped working after 60 days. Now I'm stuck with a worthless piece of junk.
3,Bad idea for runners...good otherwise,"If you're looking for a product that will accompany you on long runs, this is not the one. The player comes with neck strap allowing the player to constantly move as you do. To keep it stable, you must use an armband (not included in this buy, see manufacturer's site for the limited edition bundle, same player with armband) or pin/tuck it into the waistband of your shorts. Then comes the fact that sweat (a big No-No) will get into the player, causing it to break very easily. This model is very volatile when it comes to any amount of moisture. I've only had the product for two months and although the sound quality is good and the downloading easy, it's not exactly practical for a workout model. I recommend this product for folks who aren't looking to take it into the gym."
4,the POWER FAILURE is SOFTWARE BUG!!!,"I have the muvo, 2 weeks it dies. I put it away for a month. Then I finally called creative. Turns out, there is a bug that the player does not turn on when there has been data sorted on it. You need to go to the site and download a patch. Now mine works perfectly. So, I went from happy, to angry, to happy again.Sound quality is great for earphones, but if you hook it up to a receiver, sound is ok, but not CD quality obviously."
4,Superb little player.,"This player is great. Very simple to use, does not have too many fancy controls and quite rugged. The battery cover is difficult to manipulate and the player requires a hard format every week or so (under heavy use) but otherwise it does it's job. My only complaint is the low battery life (4-5 hours but I use rechargables) and the fact that the controls are too tiny to handle easily."
1,Not worth the trouble,"In theory, it's a great unit, and should get 5 stars, but it has so many problems, it gets 1.- the sound quality is terrible- the software is painful to use- it constantly stops working, and you need to spend ages fiddling with the software to jump start it again- there is no ""resume"" mode (eg. half way through listening to 20 tracks, or worse, an audio book, no way to resume where you left off without finding it manually)The form factor is sweet but the implementation couldn't be worse. Avoid it."
2,"Cool product design, problems with implementation","I love the design of this product. It's a USB key disk with a built-in MP3 player. It's tiny, and runs on a single AAA batter for several hours.Unfortunately, the firmware has trouble reading the filesystem properly, it seems. You can't, say, delete an MP3 and replace it with a different one. The player will begin jumping around between tracks and will then stop reading altogether. If you want to change some of the music on it, you need to reformat it and start from scratch. Similarly, you can't mix data files and MP3s. In part, I wanted to use the MuVo to shuttle files around, and it just isn't very good for that."
1,Worked great -- for 45 minutes,"I loaded up some songs, and it worked great, until the second time I used it.It now refuses to turn on. I tried replacing the battery. No luck. The power/play button feels very flimsy, and it doesn't surprise me that it broke.I'll be getting a Gruvstick instead."
1,mad at ya,i received the nomad muvo 128 mp3 player for x-mas and was very exceited. i couldnt wait to use it. but after 2 days it just stop working. i tryied new batterys and everything. so i read the reviews of other people and the samething was happening. it still worked in the usb plub. i really wish they would fix the defeat because other the that the size and removeable hard drive is wonderful. :(
1,Why buy 64Mb,Don't buy this the 128Mb version is just about to be made available for just a few pounds more.
1,don't buy this MP3 player unless your stupid,"I bought this MP3 player thinking that it would be convenient and also double as a hard disk to move files from home to work and vise versa. Since I have had the machine I have had to completely reformat it over a half dozen times (within 2 months). Currently it is not working at all. This machine has been extremely unreliable. Often I would go on a trip and it would simple not work- one then needs the CD and a computer to reformat the device before it can work again. and , after you reformat it, you have to re-install all the songs you had on there before. When it does work every time you shut it off and restart it you have to go from the beginning to get back to where you were. I thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use. Nothing is further from the truth. I am only upset now because I cannot find the receipt to return this junk. Please, do yourself a favor and get something else."
2,"Simple to use, but limited functionality and too expensive.","It is really a cosumer product, but too expensive for only 128 MB."
2,Flimpsy NOMAD MUVO 128 MB,Nomad MUVO 128 MB worked for 2-days and then it packed-up. It does not work any more with battery pack even with new batteries...
1,HERE'S WHAT YOUR BUYING!,"YOUR BUYING 128 MB WORTH OF FRUSTRATION AND $10 WORTH OF GAS FROM BACK AND FORTH TO WAL-MART.I bought my Creative MuVo and had it for a month or so. LOVED IT. had everything i needed, great mp3 worked great. One day, plugged it in to put a song on it and all of the sudden it starts smoking. Big hole in it from all the smoke. So, i return it at walmart for a new one. TWO DAYS LATER i plug it in my usb to put a song on it - smokes again!!!!!!! i returned it and got my money back... got an ipod shuffle, buy that much better mp3 player wont start on fire..."
2,It just stopped working,"This is the most compact and convenient MP3 player. It runs on one AAA battery. It's truly dummy proof. You don't even need to install a driver...just plug it into a usb port then click and drag your music into the drive and you're in business. You can even use it as an removable drive to transport any type of files (media, documents, etc).Having said all these positive things, here comes the BUT. I loved this little guy, but it broke after only 2 weeks. I bought it 1 1/2 years ago for about $120. I didn't drop it or drown it. It just stopped working. I guess I shouldn't have disregarded all the other reviewers' caveats. I traded it in for the 128MB RipFlash MP3 player/voice recorder. Although in retrospect, commuters like me who spend at least 2hrs daily on the subway should think in terms of GBs and not MBs. Perhaps it's time for an upgrade."
1,MUVo MP3 noplayer,"This has been a big disappointment after all the good reviews I read before buying last year. It skips, blips off if touched while walking or jogging. I had the replacement cotract so took it back and got another one and does the same thing. I may have had only 2 workouts over the last year that it made it through without one of the above problems. If there was a 0 star, that's what I would give it. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Great design. Too bad it is not reliable,"I have owned many mp3 players and i can say that this unit sported by far the best design. Easy to transfer files, easy to use, light, etc. Combined with the armband it was a runners dream.Until it stopped working.No drop, no water, just pushed the power button after 4 months and nothing. Too bad."
1,Don't buy,It was great until it broke 3 months in.... doesn't play anymore... I am not impressed....
1,USELESS AND WORTHLESS,"I bought the MuVo 3 months ago on www.Amazon.com and I must say that I am just on the brink of trashing it. Every time I want to use it, there is a new problem. The item completely crashed upon the third use and I had to reinstall the software which is not obvious. The worst is however that the playback volume of the MuVo is so low (subdued conversation level at max setting) that it is useless as an MP3 player unless you wish to listen to whispers of music."
2,"It's a great player, but...","The volume is excellent, as well as the clarity, and size. However, this is not the only purchase you have to make. If you want to put your CD's on it, you need to purchase a MP3 Ripper. I downloaded several free ones off of the internet, but they all have restrictions. It gets tiresome. I did not want to have to buy another product. It was just not for me."
4,Great product,"I've had the MUVO 128MB for about 2 weeks now and am very happy with it. The size is great and it is really easy to use: just plug it in and copy files to it. I don't really mind not having an LCD...it's a worthy trade-off for the size and portable-drive features. I don't like the fact that it always restarts at the first song, and I would have liked to have a random or shuffle mode. Sound quality is good and I haven't had any technical difficulties with it whatsoever."
1,Don't Sweat It!!!!,"I like the portability and relatively cheap cost. However, I have gone through 3 Nomads MuVo's. The failure is that as soon as these things get damp with a little sweat or rain they don't work period. I tried using suran wrap so that I could hold onto it while running, but that did little good. Not for use by athlete/runners."
2,"Does its job, but sure is flimsy...","I bought this thing used. Thus far, it's working fine.But, be warned that every thing about this Muvo is flimsy from the buttons, the casing, and even the battery cover. So if you're likely to drop things, DON'T GET IT. There is no 'lock button' and the pause button easily gets set off by slight pressure - even by the wrinkle of your jeans. I find this to be the most annoying thing.Also annoying is the fact that once the player is shut off and then on again, the playlist resets to the first song.I would not buy thing this at the retail cost. There aren't enough options and it can hardly be called a quality piece of equipment. Plus, there are far better options out there for less money.If you happened to get it for cheap and are just looking for something to bring to the gym or listen to while jogging in the park, it'll do fine."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought two as presents. In the course of loading music onto one of the units, the ""on/off"" button broke. Nice quality."
1,Peice of garbage!,"I had this thing for a week. After about 5 uses, the red light indicating there were no files stored on the storage device would stay on even when I verified that I had music in the player. It's extremely easy to use but it feels almost flimsy like a cheaply made product, if you know what I mean. I wouldn't recommend this thing to my worst enemy. It's an absolute don't buy!!"
1,poor quality,"My MuVo worked great until about four months in. After the 90-day warranty expired, the ""play"" button stopped working - and I'd only been using it once in awhile. The company wouldn't do anything about it, so now I'm stuck with what's become a $100 floppy disk. Save your money on this one."
1,Broken within 3 months,"if you go to cnet.com and search on MuVo there are many accounts of them breaking within the first 3 months. Mine was no exception.it still will hold data, but won't play mp3's any longer. It's great when it works, but the quality of workmanship is extremely poor."
1,skip this player,"I had a nightmare experience with this player. When I turned the volume up it skipped like crazy. I visited the Creative website and could find no explanation of why it was doing this, so I loaded their updated software, which didn't fix it, so I downloaded their firmware, still no luck. Creative has no 800# so what do I do - support a company that doesn't have a real customer service department to solve a problem that they can't explain? And get this, Creative sent me a confused email guessing that my source was the problem without even explaining why that would cause the problem and not offering a possible fix or any king of solution. Well, no 800#, so I sent the player back, and I'm buying an MPIO player."
1,Works for only a few months!!,"It seems that most of the glowing reviews for this product are from people who have only had their Muvo's for a couple of weeks. I loved ours too - while it worked - but we also experienced the same thing I've recently read in these reviews.About 3 days after the 3 month warranty expired the thing just died. I emailed technical assistance and they guided me through the recovery process. It worked for another 3 months, and then - after pushing the pause button - wouldn't play again. We tried the same recovery exercise, emailed tech help again, and their final suggestion was that it must be defective & to send it back with $$$ to put towards 'repair or replacement'. I don't know about you, but when I've already spent $$$ only 6 months before, I'd rather not sink more money into a defective product, or a company that won't do the right thing. Bottom line - it's great at first, but spend your money for something that's great and lasts for a while!"
1,don't even touch this thing...,The first day I got this I could not format the thing. First the LCD would not turn green or red which means it is not working in the first place and spent 4 hours trying to format/install/whatever but nothing worked...
1,Great idea - but couldn't find one that worked.,"I went through FOUR of these and had to return EVERY one. After a few days the players began to stop at apparently random times during playback. I wanted a small, reliable mp3 player to use at the gym. I finally decided on a Rio S35s Sport 128MB player which works just fine and has more features."
1,warning: the amazon.com three-star rating is misleading!,"Before you consider buying this product, click ""all customer reviews"" and then click ""one star reviews only"" and READ them. of the 126 reviews for this product, 53 are one-star reviews, most of which tell the same story: this product is fabulous for three months, three weeks, or (in many cases) three days, but then it stops working altogether -- and the offers of help from the folks at Creative Labs are mostly ineffectual or mere delusions. My experience: It stopped working after four days. You wouldn't know this from the three-star rating (obviously an average of the high marks that folks give the product when it doesn't break and the low marks given by the rest of us) -- or from the ""spotlight reviews"" that amazon.com posts..."
4,Very nice MP3 Player,"This is my very first MP3 player I purchased few years ago. In two words, I just love this little thing. I visited my country taking it with me, droped it several times and nothing happened to this little machine. I had only one trouble in Athens (Greece), when I could not turn it on, but after Creative sent me an e-mail telling me what to do, voila, my Muvo is back working again. It needed a firmware ...Yesterday, I ordered from Amazon, another MP player, this time I got me a bigger one. I am getting the Creative MuVo N200 512MB, plenty of music for me since my other one (64MB) is holding only 10 to 12 songs.Now, if you wish to get a very small gadget that plays good music, I strongly suggest you get a Creative product, I do like them."
4,Small and Dependabe,I use this to listen to audible books exclusively. It is very dependable with easy controls and not a lot to go wrong. I had an old rio that was very fussy. I am much pleased with the battery life and simplicity of this player.
2,Excellent until it broke,"I'd just like to mirror the comments of many other reviewers. I like my MuVo quite a lot, but after three months of use the Volume Down button has stuck semi-permanently making it very difficult to change tracks.If it were a reliable product it would be excellent.Dennis"
2,"coolest, then dashed hopes, now tail spin","It WAS the coolest. Then on the 3rd day it stopped -- no clue. FAQs and self help on Creative's site eventually got me to download Creative's formatter software. I formatted it and it was back! But not for long. 2 days later it stopped again. This time it was worse. WinXP couldn't recognize it as a muvo anymore, only as some generic device. I formatted it again but ""Format Failed"" and the Muvo red LED when out. That was the end. Nothing I tried worked. It took two weeks to get an RMA from Creative using their self serve customer care web page. Since then I've been reading reviews from others having almost the exact same problems, one guy on this 3rd return which also eventually failed. Stay away from this product until they fix it."
3,Love it but can't stop and restart later; must go to beginni,"It's a great machine. But if you have long files (e.g. audio books) it is not so useful. Have to start all over again, if you stop for more than a minute or so. Also no counter to see where you are, or indicator of the files on the device. Good idea needs work"
3,Good...but could be better.,A simple breakdown:The size and weight are fantastic although an aluminum outer case would seem more sturdy than the .... plastic.The earbuds that come with it sound poor and fit poorly.I hope the firmware can be upgraded because it would be nice if you could:1.Load a playlist file you create on your PC2.Tweak the EQ and other settings from your PCAll in all this is a good little machine to take running or to the gym but it's far from an audiophiles dream.
1,"Great, until it died","At first I thought this was a terrific little gizmo --so cute, so tiny, so easy to use -- but mine stopped working after 4 hours of play. The memory module still functioned, but the playback bit was dead as a doornail. So back to the store it went. Too bad, I would have liked it to work out."
1,$135????,How is this outdated 128MB mp3 player priced at $135. Ridiculous. I would pay $5.00 at the most for this.
5,Bought one of these for each of my teens,"My children are 15 and 12 who received this as a gift. I was not interested in buying a high end device for either of them because they tend to leave their things lying around to get stepped on or stolen by the dog. It was perfect for them because they not only download music but also use the flash drive capability to store their homemade videos, illustrator images and even school assignments which they upload at the school computer labs. It is very durable and while it may not have state of the art audio output it is fine for listening to tunes on the school bus, in the car or while walking the dog. Awesome unit for the price."
3,Worked OK for first year or so,"When this device worked, it was great. Small, could go running with it, and I remember excellent audio clarity. But every once in a while it wouldn't work. And I could never figure out why. 80% of the time worked great. 20% of time it really pissed me off. A year later it seems to have completely stopped working. Would probably have given a 5 if the player was more solid and tech difficulties/bugs had been worked out."
3,Okay - I guess,Basically I bought this player for audiobooks. I own an iPod Shuffle and would recommend that for music. Otherwise it's works okay I guess. Afterall I only payed 5 bucks for it on eBay
4,"If you like John Carpenter, you might like this film","John Carpenter has always been my favorite director and I will defend his films to the end. I love the atmosphere he injects into his stylish, dark films. On that note I have always liked The Golden Child. I'm not huge Eddie Murphy fan but there's always something about this film I liked. It has a certain quirkiness to it that reminded me of some Carpenter classics as Big Touble in Little China. Well, I recently bought a John Carpenter book and it said that he was actually going to direct the film at first but backed out. Well no wonder I like this picture. It's a shame he never directed it as it might of turned out even more interesting, but I am glad he decided to do Big Trouble in Little China instead."
5,They don't make movies like this anymore,There was a time when movies expected us to suspend our disbelief as they followed a hilarious plot without the burden of self-reference or irony. Eddy Murphy shines in this light and uninhibited search for the child who will save the world from its sins.
2,Not true WideScreen!!!!,"For true movie buffs looking for ""real"" widescreen"", pass this one up. The movie is presented in a ""boxed"" screen format on current HDTV's, so you will need to ""zoom in"".Movie is dated for sure. I do remember liking this movie as a kid, but now, I just roll my eyes.....leave this one for the rental stores."
4,"""One Of Eddie's Best!""","Eddie Murphy and Charles Dance star in this 1986 comedy-adventure. A social worker is chosen to save a magicalTibetian child. I've always liked this film and think it'sone of Eddie's best. Dance is also a good villain as usualand this dvd has decent picture and sound, but only thetrailer. I recommend this 80's classic."
3,FUNNY IN SOME SCENES BUT IT`S CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST COMEDY,"Eddie Murphy is funny here but the story is so bogus that all it has is Murphy`s name to carry it through. Murphy plays a social worker who specializes in finding lost children, is hired by an tibertian woman to locate an anjelliac child who was kidnapped by demoic forces. I give Eddie Murphy credit he did his best in trying to make something out of a mediocre script with his humor but he should of stayed away from the person(s) who talked him into making this film. After seeing this film i see why Eddie Murphy was anxious to do BEVERLY HILLS COP II a year later and try to regain his box office bankabillty."
4,"Don't listen to the ""critics""","I think it odd that the movie critics trashed this ""megahit"" If it sucked so bad, why did everyone go to see it. I think that this is one of Eddie's best early comedies, with subtle humor that makes the movie even funnier. At times the movie seems slow, but overall it is a funny movie and well worth buying."
5,This movie rates buying DVD version,"Liked the mix of Adventure, Action, Comedy, with a touch of Horror. Eddie did a fine job of keeping me interested even after seeing the movie several times, it's still fun to watch."
3,Solid Eddie Murphy Flick,"Okay, I think the Amazon.com review was a bit harsh, but three stars is really all this film is truly worth. Is it one of Eddie Murphy's best? Heck no. DADDY DAYCARE had more depth to some extent. However, there is much to like in this film.First, Murphy does his very best with a somewhat weak script and poor special effects. His dialogue interfaces with Victor Wong (the Old Man) are very funny. And the dream sequence with the splendid Charles Dance (as a very good Sardo Numspa) and Tex Cobb was well done.Second, Charlotte Lewis looks great. I don't need acting, I need a hotty in the film. Check!Third, ""I, I, I, I got the knife..."" Classic!Fourth, it's simply fun camp. Sit back, don't take it seriously, and enjoy. The ending may be stupid as heck, but by then you won't care."
2,average at best,this film isn't one of Eddie's best or even that good or even pretty good.i thought Charlotte Lewis was nice looking but a okay actress at best.nobody i know talks about this film and with good reason it's not something you choose to remember.
5,EXCELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLANT !!!!!,THIS WAS A GREAT COMEDY MOVIE. IT MADE ME LAUGH EVERY SINGLE TIME. I WOULD RATE IT ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES.
3,Okay Movie.,I saw this movie on TBS during Dinner and a Movie and they pointed out one hilarious part of the movie and that was that the sounds that girl made in the movie. They sounded incredibly fake. The movie had a predictable premise but I liked the snake lady she was cool to look at. This movie doesn't seem to be a favorite among people and I don't know why. The DVD is okay but still has no good extra features.
3,"Golden no, decent yes","This is certainly not one of Eddie Murphy's hits, but I think it deserves a look. This has enough of an interesting story, comedy, and decent acting to make it at least a decent rental. Fans of movies like ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and ""The Phantom"" are most likely to enjoy it the most. It is a bit of an oddball cross between an oriental story of mysticism and a US big city detective story with a little Murphy goofyness thrown in to boot. I will say the music sucks. That is one thing that probably hurt this movie the most. It is sounds like they tried to match rock music, poorly, to a mysticism movie. To bad John Carpenter didn't direct this and do the music, it would have been much better."
3,The Golden Child,"The Golden Child~ J.L. Reate is a pretty good movie but it is nowhere close to his best movies of the early 80's like Coming to America, Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop. Eddie Murphy is doing a great job in the role but his jokes are a bit lame since one has heard them in other movies before. The music is what makes this movie less then stellar. The music is terrible to say the least. It seems to me like they went way cheap on selecting the person to write the soundtrack and many other tracks sounds like cheap 80's music produced in someone's basement. The script is alright but it just that extra fun and excitement that other Eddie Murphy movies. Still and all this is not a bad movie and I give it the 3 stars that it deserves."
2,Golden Balls,"This film made a lot of money on its release, and i was not surprised: there was action comedy, and Charles Dance not pronouncing his ""j""'s coupled with some special effects circa 1978. what more could it need?And yet...for some reason, after watching this film, i felt somehow unfulfilled. Perhaps it was not explaining who the real bad guy was(i'm sorry, Forces Of Evil is not enough for me). Maybe it was the low low grade action. Maybe it was just the Forces of Evil surrounding me, but the truth is, i just couldn't bring myself to be able to like this film.It is however not all bad, This is Eddie Murphy on vintage ""Trading Places"" style form, which is always worth the laugh, and there is one dream sequence which is so surreal its...well, surreal.Despite this however, my suggestion would be to watch it on TV rather than buy it. it just aint worth the nuggets."
3,for its time,for its time it was a great movie but it was just so cheesy compared to now it sucked.. lol so idk if u can watch the movie realizing they didnt have all the stuff then they do now it was a okay movie
5,"No, not 5 stars, 500 stars","There's lots wrong with the modern world, from nuclear bombs to nonstop advertising on TV, but this collection makes it all worthwhile - well, perhaps that is a slight overstatement, but it is really marvelous. For many years I lusted after the Bach Gesellschaft edition of Bach's collected works, but its 46 volumes were always well beyond my budget and my space. Now I have them all on a single disc. Anything and everything can be found with a few mouse clicks and can be printed out as small as you like for convenience or as large as you need for use at the keyboard or to aid failing sight. A cornucopia worthy of a king available to the meanest peon - well, there I go again, but this collection makes me realize how inadequate language can be. If you can read music, and you recognize Bach as the closest thing to a credible deity, then you cannot live much longer without this DVD."
2,My 11th mistake.,"A bitter pill. No doubt this is all good advice--the authors are therapists and boy, does it show. Problem is, if you could do all the things they suggest you wouldn't need a book. Shy? Solution: Don't be. Not assertive or overly assertive? Solution: Don't be. And so it goes.I can't imagine anyone who doesn't make some of the mistakes the authors describe--nor can I imagine anyone who could correct these just by reading this book. (I'm not even convinced years of therapy would necessarily work but I digress).To be fair, the authors pretty much say that you're gonna have to have a lot of dates, its likely to be a long process. One thanks her family and friends for ""helping me maintain my sanity through all those years of dating"". Sounds like fun, doesn't it?"
5,Relevant to more than dating,"This book shows the reader how to be a better significant other by focusing on improving themselves. While that is the main focus of the book the rules applied to dating by Gruzen and Sperber are also very applicable to all relationships that people are in, friendships, roommates, etc. Humerous but poignant examples show the reader what he or she might be doing wrong, and often what he or she is doing right!"
3,"Relationships ""Lite""","This book has everything you need to cure your dating dilemas, but the information is presented in such an ""in your face"" style that it may offend some dater's delicate sensibilities. Yeah, I'm flawed, but I don't need the good doctors to hit me over the head with it. Break it to me gently. Some of this stuff may be a revelation to the truly dating impaired, and we need a little more coaching to make it our own. Don't get me wrong, this quick reading book covers every dating mistake you are likely to make (many more than the 10 in the title), and gives you suggestions for improvement. However, if you would like to have the subject covered with more sensitivity, try reading John Gray's Mars and Venus on a Date, or Barbara DeAngelis' Are You the One For Me?"
4,The top dating mistakes we all make...,"...can be found here. It's always the little things that can ruin it for so many singles when out on that first date. This must-read book should be part of your dating arsenal. You just might see yourself in these pages. Identify your mistakes, then learn from them by reading this.Perry Rose, author of I Love You...Will You Marry Me?! & Women, Sex And Dating, For The Single Man."
3,Strained Similes,"I had this book sitting on my shelves for over 20 years and finally decided to read it. I was hugely disappointed, particularly at the awkwardness of the writing. The use of similes, so elegant in Chandler's writing, are here so strained that they actually stop the flow of the narrative. There are a couple of choice turns of phrase, but they are few and far between.The plotting is fine, but very typical of MacDonald, where a deeply buried family secret has to be rooted out to solve the case. I wish I had enjoyed the experience of getting to the twisty finale."
5,Works for everything,"I actually started using this as lubricant at the recommendation of my ob/gyn, but this stuff is great for lots of uses. I have really dry skin around my hairline and a tiny dab just after showering does more than any thick moisturizer has. Put it in a pretty glass bottle with the money you'll probably save. Sorry to sound like an infomercial but I find new uses for this all the time."
5,Very Good Product,Purchase 5 bottles and gave a few away as gifts. Great product for the price. Makes my skin soft and silky. I will absolutely purchase more.
4,Does what it says on the box,"A thorough compilation of the band's best known tracks. The remixed bonus CD was incidental in my purchase, but I guess it gives an alternative sound to those who want it."
4,"Without this, I am nothing...","I've liked Placebo for a little while, but I dont have any of their CD's anymore. So I saw this little beauty on the shelf and picked it up. A pretty good mix of their best and a very nice remix disc. A frequent play for all occasions. I especially like the UNKLE track."
4,Interesting mix...weird album pics....,"Well...I never was exactly a Placebo fan, but a few songs I really did like. ""Every You Every Me"" is a favorite of mine.The songs are, well...as far as I know, Placebo. You can't mix up the voice at all. It's very distinctive, and the music itself is very distinctive.One of my first hearings of Placebo was ""Pure Morning"" but it was Les Rythmes Digitales remix of the song, and I was delighted to find that it was on this compilation and I really only bought the CD for that purpose, as well as to get a better sense of the group as a whole.I like all of the songs here, and I have to say, I am probably going to get the other albums as well, so I can have a full sense of what they are capable of, because as I can see right now, this really is an impressive compilation of songs. I love remixes, so that's a plus as well.All in all, a great mix of music. I can't say for sure how good, but as it stands right now, not knowing a lot about Placebo, it's good, and I like it."
4,A very good album,"I first heard about Placebo from a co-worker who recommended them to me. After listening to some of their stuff on youtube, I decided to purchase this album. My favorite songs on here are...36 degrees, teenage angst, nancy boy, pure morning, taste in men, and the bitter end.If you want to get a very good playlist of Placebo's early hits without buying their first 4 albums, this is a good choice. I just wish it had Meds the remake of Running Up That Hill. Maybe later they will release a singles album containing everything after 2004. In the meantime, I certainly recommend this to Placebo fans, and fans of 90s alternative rock music in general."
5,Wonderful Gem of a Book,"If there is such a thing as an unknown classic, then ""Emergence"" would qualify. The writing style is funny, moving, and exciting. The protagonist is wonderful. The storyline is interesting. I can only compare it to ""Podkayne of Mars"" by Heinlein for the story's tone and style.</p>"
5,Half a review... sorry!,"Only half a review as the book, sadly got left in a small house in Crete in 1990 before I finished it. What can I say? I've spent the past 11 years trying to track down another copy. This book represents the Single most burning ambition that remains in my life. I must finish reading it. Such is the compelling nature of the characters and story contained within.Truly a readers read. Read it in small sections, Read it right through in one go, Read it a dozen times, just don't leave it in a Cretan mountain village before you finish it....... it will haunt you forever."
4,"Very few flaws, but they warn of writer's weaknesses","Emergence is an inspiring and often touching book about a very intelligent girl, who must deal with a post Nuclear/Biological war world. As others have noted, there are similarities in feel to Heinlein's juveniles. However, I feel there are too many deus ex machina points that provide cracks in an otherwise excellent story to give it a full five stars. Palmer's attraction to the superhuman proved a dooming weakness in his second novel with an adult protagonist, but here it's still workable. I believe it was John W. Campbell who observed that it's all but impossible for human authors to write about the superhumans, save at the beginning of their rise in childhood, or during their final faltering decline during old age. Emergence handles a gifted child well.Generally hard to find, but a very good gift for a bright pre-teen."
1,emergence,I found the stop start shorthand type script absolutely impossible to warm to. After 40 pages I simply put the book aside. I couldn't get into it. The single most frustrating book I ever read all the more so because the other reviews said the story and characters were so interesting. Dead dull. Awful. 0% for me.
3,Dated post-it note,"Can't read book. Less like journal, more like reading post-it notes left by kids on fridge. Seems dated. Too bad idea looked good."
1,Optima Batteries and Warranty Suck,"I purchased the battery from Sears about 3 years ago. The battery had a 3 year warranty, Sears no longer carried the battery and would not exchange it. I purchased a new one figuring Optima would refund and warranty their exchange. They wanted me to send the battery in, wait 3 weeks for warranty processing, and would not refund my money for the new purchased battery. They didn't care that I purchased another one of their products and did care if I was without a car for 3 weeks.Based on Warranty policy and the fact that it only lasted 2.75 years I would never buy nor recommend.OPTIMA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Megamorphs #3,"I thought the begining of this book was very intresting, showing a different way the Animorphs could have been. I think the 'Melissa' mentioned was Melissa Chapman,I wonder how she got into the Animorphs? Well, anyway this book had a great start and some good scenes at the Battle of Agincourt, I liked the bit with Tobias in the church. But then the book sort of went downhill with battle after battle. It seemed to just be the same old thing, and a lot of the information was hard to take in all at once for example where all the Animorphs were. The ending improves this book which I thought was a clever solution to the problem, so Jake didn't 'come back to life', he was never dead. It was pretty enjoyable, fast-moving with plenty of action. Still, it wasn't the best Megamorphs. I prefer #1 or #2. Its got a nice cover, though Tobias looks wrong. Get this if you're an Animorphs fan."
2,Pointless but fun,"Another book of the series I never saw the point in, but it was still fun and action-y just the same. Still, I can't figure out why the plot can't be continued instead of thrown into contrived ways to try to get/keep fans. At least the Animorph flavor is going strong."
1,It's ok,"I have been reading animorphs for 3 years now and LOVED them but, this has to be one of the worst ones yet!! I LOVED the David 3 sum, but this book was not so good!! I liked the history and all but the most important part (the ending), was horrible."
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT, BUT CONFUSING IN THE BEGINING. IT'S REALLY COOL BECAUSE THEY GO BACK IN TIME. SO IF YOU HAVENT YET BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,It rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I've read all the animorphs books and next to the first jorny (how ever you spell that) this is the best.
3,Too much promise without delivering,"Cokins' book is certainly well written, interesting and updated, though nothing new is said there on the subject... it even falls short from its ""making it work"" promise (see Title), driving the reader thru lots of figures and nice diagrams (119 in total) but very little about ""how-to-implement"" an ABC/ABM system in your company. It may be useful to make a ""sales"" presentation for ABC/ABM systems (many of those diagrams will surely fit in), but its main practical value for everyday operations may be found in Chapter 2, where he insightfully describes some causes for ABC/ABM failure. So if you're looking for a ""cookbook"" (as I was), you'd better look somewhere else."
5,Do you know your ABC's?,I bought this book to get an understanding of Active-Based cost management. The theory came out in a time of many conflicting Project management and product flow theories. Just as with all the conflicting diet books of the time. The management in the factory I worked suggested I read this book and extrapolate anything useful. Then we can apply what worked and not swallow the whole thing at any cost.The book gives a clear message and plenty of diagrams to support the reading. It should be a must read for any systems analyst.
5,Easy to read AND understand; logical; flowing.,"I just finished your book ""Activities Based Costing: Making It Work"". Great job! Easy to read AND understand; logical; flowing. Excellent graphic and pictorial support. This is clearly the best work out on ABC. Thank you for your contribution. It should be a must read for every manager-administrator in the health industry -- or any other, for that matter. David Eitel, MD, FACEP York, PA"
4,"VERY, VERY GOOD, BUT NOT EXCELLENT","For the price [...] this DVD player is well worth the money. It does not have progressive scan, but I did not purchase this player for that feature. This unit has many good features and the sound and picture quality are very good by using just the RCA audio and video connections. It had a very good review from consumer reports (a publication I highly recommed and utilize, sepecially for consumer electronic purchases). MP3 playback is very good, as is the VCD. DVD-R, CD-R/RW, all play well on this device.Not an excellent player (for excellence purchase a Sony DVD-NC655P, my other player). But still a very, very good and economical player."
4,good for the money,No real problems with it. SVCD you can only speed up 8X and you can't jump to a spot. Thats a bummer for me. Otherwise for the price range remote and features seems great. Good picture and sound quality for DVDs.
4,"remote in ""REMOTE""",easy set-up...plays ok thru conventional monitor..remote not easy to use...similar pricing @ local electronic stores...
4,Great value priced dvd player,"I bought this player mainly because of its ability to play VCDs and SVCDs in addition to DVDs of course. Unfortunately, it does skip sometimes with SVCDs which is most likely due to higher bitrate scenes the player can't handle. Other than that I have no complaints as the picture and audio quality is great."
2,Does not have progressive-scan,"Great, but does not have progressive-scan. TVs are going digital and if you get a DVD player which does not have progressive-scan you will have to updgrade if and when you buy a digital TV or miss out on the charm of the beautiful view. A progressive-scan DVD player playing on a digital TV is the ultimate picture -- you have to see it to believe it.So unless you are sure that you will never upgrade your TV to Digital, do not buy a DVD-player without the p-scan feature."
4,A good buy,"I bought this DVD player to lighten the load off my PS2. I can happily say that it was very very worth it. I bought it for [money] and I got a good quality player. Has a very nice playback, and I bought component cables wich made it look great.It also plays CDS, VCDS and MP3SI recommend this to everyone who wants an affordible player"
4,Average DVD player,"Another reviewer mentioned the horizontally ""squeezed"" look of the picture. Indeed, when first taken out of the box, the DVD player is set to display on a 16x9 set -- not what most of us have these days! All one has to do to ""fix"" this is to go to the settings menu and set your TV type according to what you have (I used 4x3, letterbox and the picture looks just fine).The remote control is better laid out than many that ship with similarly-priced DVD players. A/V quality is pretty standard. There are component, RCA, S-video, and both coax and optical digital audio outputs.I lowered the point score of my review for the following reasons:1) The remote control sensitivity is below average. It works, but it's not nearly as sensitive as most of my other equipment;2) There's only one set of RCA A/V outputs. Granted, it has a full complement of outputs (see above), but an additional set of RCA A/V outputs would have been helpful in my particular configuration."
2,Confused...,"This was wasn't NEARLY as good as 'Sarah' but not quite as bad as 'Zipporah'. I was just about to put it down when Lilah was summoned to the queen. That's when it picked up and ""saved"" this book. I'm confused because I don't see how Marek could have written such a WONDERFUL book in 'Sarah' and then fallen so far in his next two.If you can borrow this book from a friend or a library then I would say to read it, but don't spend money on the hardcover version."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. I read Sarah, and thought it was great. Zipporah was almost as good....this was not nearly as good. If you have read the other 2, you will probably want to read this, but if not....don't bother.The story is loosely based on the book of Ezra. I'm not sure Lilah is actually mentioned in the Bible, and I can't find her. The book started out very slowly, got interesting enough to continue about halfway through, but had a sudden and horrible ending. Very unsatisfactory!If this were submitted for a writing class and I was the instructor, I'd be handing it back with big red marks saying, ""please try again Marek, I KNOW you can do better!"""
1,Lilah,"Sadly, Halter at his worst. Sarah was magnificent. Zipphorah was excellent, although it has a disappointing ending, but Lilah simply isn't worth the money. Weak story line and I can only categorize it as mediocre at best. I'm sorry I bought it and wish I could get a refund.My recommendation is don't waste your money on this book!"
3,ok terrible ending,"This book was ok. I found the beginning hard to get into. However the more i got into it, the more I enjoyed it. The middle and end was very exciting. I started to feel more for the main character and then all of a sudden..the ending happens. I thought the ending was terrible, there was absolutely no closure."
3,I wish it was better,"I read Sarah and Zipporah and absolutely fell in love with them. I was so excited to read the third book in the trilogy that I marked the date on my calendar the day it came out. I was, however, a bit dissapointed. If you read the other two you should still read this one, but it is definately no where near as wonderful as Sarah or Zipporah."
4,He does it again!,Another can't-put-it-down book. A page-turner. A very decerning eye for detail. Written from much mediation of Scripture.The only negative point is some missing detail from the French to English translation. Not as fluenty translated as the first 2 books of the trilogy. But saying that it is well-translated and VERY WELL WRITTEN.EXCELLENT STORY LINE!
3,left me hanging,"I loved Sarah, Zipporah was entertaining. This book, however, left me hanging with no real ending to someone who doesn't know the real history. Seemed like Antinoes was left hanging, as well. What did she die of? Nobody knows unless you already know the history. Many don't as I did not. It's the author's responsibility to inform us at least a little."
2,Not worthy,"Of the three books in this trilogy this one is the stinker. Not well written and just mostly boring. Not very believable as well.Chaotic character development, poor story line etc. Not worth the money as a new book....buy it used if at all."
5,Great!,"What great reading. I've read all 3 books of the Canaan Trilogy and have enjoyed being able to put them in the prospective of ""real"" lives and real stories. They are ""fiction"", but the characters are very real and help us to realize that they did exist and they did have lives very similar to ours. Thank you Marek Halter to making the stories come to life."
3,french,"The arrival time, shipping and packaging were fantastic, however the book was in French; this was probably stated somewhere on the purchase page, but I overlooked it. Would definitely buy from here again, but am now stuck with a book in French.."
5,Women in the Bible,"Marek Halter created 3 books - 'Lilah, Sarah, and Zipporah"" that depict strong women in the Bible. They are wonderful examples of how important women were during this period of time. They provided strength and character to the men they supported. During the early years of Christianity, women were and still are important."
1,poor construction,"The item is described as having 1012 pieces. I am assuming the 25 trays, the 45 bins and the box are 71 items out of the 1012 total. What was shipped to me was only the 71 storage items; the actual connectors etc were missing. This then is just a review of 71 items I received. When I pulled the plastic box out of cardboard box I was careful that I held the front of the box up so that the trays would not slip out. One tray did slip out the backside because the holes on the back are big enough for the tray to fit through. The tray fell three feet and broke. I have seen some poorly made storage containers before but this one takes the 1st place as the worst by far. Thin brittle plastic, holes on the back of the box and the drawers do not slide well. I wish I could have checked out the actual parts but they were missing. I sent the box back."
2,Not worth buying,"At first glance, this DVD Player was a plus. It even had Duel Laser pickup, which virtually eliminates that stupid pause between layers on Duel Layer DVDs.However, I found the picture and playability of the disc to be unsatisfactory. I hooked it up using the component video outputs, and I would occasionally get a highly noticable blue line at the top of the screen, and an occassional red wiggly afterglow on some text that appeared during certain films. And the picture would be a little jumpy - occasionally.Also, sometimes the player wouldn't play a disc. I'd have to take the disc out of the player, and put it back in for it to play. It was a perfectly fine disc that played on my previous DVD player.Overall, this player had potential, but failed."
4,Works great and satisfactory MP3 sound quality,"Small convient player, works great and has an excellent picture"
1,Stopped working after 1 week; terrible tech support,"I got this as a gift from a Korean friend and it stopped working after just one week! Customer service was totally incompetent and barely spoke English, which made me all the madder after long hold times. Stay away. For good, cheap DVD players, try Apex (an American company). Otherwise stick with Japanese brands."
3,"Good price for features, half-decent performance...","This DVD player has most of the features you would find in a $200+ player at a much lower cost. However, it doesn't take long to figure out why this player is so affordable. I, like other reviewers, experienced the ""skipping"" problems of this player. Audio CD's and MP3 CD's are handled well by this player. The problem exists with DVD movies, as this player sometimes randomly skips scenes while viewing the movie, and will also skip entire chapters when slowly searching through the movie. As I mentioned, this only occurs seldomly, but is still annoying when watching DVD movies. I wouldn't recommend this player to anyone unless there were no better options available at this price with this set of features."
2,Sometimes works sometimes it doesn't,"I've only had this player for two weeks and I've not decided yet whether I'm going to return it or not but if it keeps performing the way it has been, I'll probably return it. You can play the same DVD more than once and at first it'll be fine and then it skips whole scenes at a whim. I've not played too many CD's on it so I can't vouch for that. I ordered this player because I have a Samsung burner/DVD combo player in my Dell computer and it works great. I cannot believe my computer DVD player outperforms a standalone player. I believe you used to be able to buy high quality electronic merchandise but it seems these companies just keep churning out crap and we keep buying it. What a shame."
5,This DVD player is for real.,"The playback performance of this DVD player is outstanding. I have played many DVD-Rs on this unit and it never skips. Even ones that have many scratches.While the Digest lable might be misleading, ( I like the word index)this preview feature of video and audio is excellent.Not all current Samsung DVD models perform as well as this one.Other models look simular but do not perform as well. I recorded a DVD-R, using the highest quality option that the Pioneer PRV9000 will record. Other Samsung DVD players would not play it back.The only item I found this unit that was weak, is the round knob on the large remote control in the center, it is not always a positive action and somtimes you have to hit it 2 or 3 times to get the option wanted. That is the operation of the remote control and not a DVD player performance issue. I can overlook that minor issue.A great product at a great price."
4,"Overall good, except the remote controls","Played the widest variety of formats, not as any other DVD player I could test, however it seemed responding slower than average when loading and during playing. Screen Fit button is probably unique at all for this DVD player and it is very useful.I rated this product as four stars, because the remote controls were my the only disappointment with it, often they respond with delays or not at all from any distance/angle, also the joystick like button is bad, I wonder if a home theater master remote control will solve this problem, as I read in reviews many people feel like to switch to it, including me..."
1,Not worth buying at any price,"At first glance, the P421 appears to be a well-made progressive scan DVD player at a very attractive price. But don't be seduced by its handsome front panel or sale prices that seem too good to be true. Believe me, this player is not a good buy at any price!The picture and sound quality are fine, but the scan speed is awful! The unit only responds to the remote controls (two are provided) when it feels like it, so you are forced to push the same buttons over and over again before it finally wakes up. This problem is so frustrating that it quickly negates any positive qualities this player may have.After watching just one DVD, I packed it up and returned it for a refund. Spare yourself the aggravation. You can do MUCH better than this for just a few dollars more!"
2,Good for a while,"Have had the Samsung P421 for about a year an a half. 10 months into ownership it began pausing occasionally and randomly in the middle of a DVD, then either skipping or stopping entirely with the ""Disc will not play message."" Initially I attributed this to to a disc that was dirty or damaged, but when cleaning a disc didn't help and it did it as well with clean DVDs that played satisfactorily on other players, I realized the player was at fault. As time has gone on it's gotten worse, and now it displays this problem on at least 70% of the DVDs played and refuses to play through about 15% of the DVDs. Much too unreliable or short-lived to recommend. Too bad, because a number of its features are excellent."
5,good shoe,"Great shoe for the money. Super light weight and easy for little ones to put on. Great for the summer, and for traveling."
1,Got Buggered on this one,"I was told it was in stock for a reasonable price,and told later, it was unavalable. Big disapointment!"
3,Crazy technique,"This album is good no doubt. Some of the best moments are Chris playing ""Stella..."" on soprano. Just really tasty. The problem I have with this disc is that the technique gets a bit overpowering at times. That intro to ""Boogie Stop Shuffle"" is awesome in its execution...but in terms of musicality? Thank God for the Mark Turners, and Seamus Blakes of the world."
5,Jazz in its most interesting form !!!,"I like to compare this cd with the wonderful ""Footprints Live"" by Wayne Shorter (2001). The level is the same : quality, hits, swing, complexity. The musicians are all tremendous. Kevin Hays on piano (using funny electric gimmicks at periods), Scott Coley on bass (imperial) and Bill Stewart (who is to me one of the best jazz drummers with Bill Kilson, Ari Hoenig, Brian Blade and others...)This Live performance is well released ""mixing"" up and mid-tempos.Highly recommended."
5,Well Documented Eye-Opening Book on Globalist Trends,"As a publisher for many years, Alan Franklin has been in a unique position to review the thousands of articles on globalist trends, from their innocuous beginnings as efforts to enhance trade to their current usurpations of national sovereignty. Alan goes to great lengths to meticulously document this seemingly inevitable trend for power to be concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals who are not subject to elective control. The material in this book may be somewhat above the comprehension level of some, but when read with an open-minded there is a very sobering awarness of what the future may hold."
4,"Confusing box, this is the new REAL ADVENTURES OF JONNY QUEST!","The box is confusing, the red triangle at the top right states ""Two Classic Episodes from the Original TV Series"", this would be the 1965 series that is already out on DVD. But this is really the third incarnation of the series from the mid 1990's: THE REAL ADVENTURES OF JONNY QUEST. Questworld is the cyber world that Jonny enters to battle virtual villians. This series differs slightly from the original, but it is still very good.Also notice that this DVD is LESS than an HOUR long, only 47 MINUTES (Two episodes). The $5 price no longer seems so cheap, convert this price per two episodes to a complete season box and you would be paying $60 for the first season set already out."
3,Not exactly what I ordered,"I ordered the cartridges here because the price was so much less (about a third) than the rest. I should have known there was a reason, but the picture showed a new box just like I had purchased from other places in the past, also the ad said new & the seller had good ratings. When I received the boxes they were generic & had a label stuck on them, written on the label in ink was AL100TD,not AL110TD as pictured in the ad, also printed on one of the cartridges itself it said that it was a starter cartridge & would not last but approximately a third of the time,(sound familiar?), that a full replacement cartridge would.While these seem to work just fine in the copier if they weren't a new full size replacement then the customer deserves to know. As usual you get what you pay for."
4,copy me on this,"Expensive as heck, but does the job, and thus my rating.Someone has gotta start up a reputable business of recharging these cartridges for a lot less than they now sell for, as there is a lot of profit in the current selling price. Nuff said."
3,Good little book with the essentials,"I enjoy this little book for sharing easy and familiar german food with people. It contains all of the usual suspects like saurbraten, goulash, roasts and then a few interesting recipes such as frankfurters and noodles.Fun easy to follow book with nice recipes, no authrity on the subject but an easy overview from nearly 50 years ago!"
5,Great Resource,I used this book in my MBA program. This is a very good resource. It is researched based with many articles that are relatively short and to the point.
4,NIce,"Not the most comfortable, but nice coverage on eyes and nice shade of tint. Will even fit over small glasses."
1,Did not fit,Normally I like Stride Rite Products because I know that they will fit right. But this pair of 7W were too SMALL for my daughter's foot and she's sized at 6.5. This was a very disappointment.
1,Too Small,I purchased these for my daughter to wear over the holiday's. I bought an size larger than she wears (8) only to find the shoes are made very small and she could not wear them... Dissapointed
4,Mauler Pop,"I've been listening to this album a lot lately, when I first heard it I was disappointed that the direction of guitar was being downplayed, and a pop direction was being focused. But I came back to the album and realized that aside from the slightly marred production and a couple bad missteps in song direction in the songs 'zapped'and 'Wammo'that this is a pretty great pop record. Brent's drumming on this album is so heavily propulsive, he provides the base for the whole groove on the record. The guitars are toned down, to focus on pop song structure but pop like the beatles trying to play their instruments inside a tank with you listening on the outside. 'Voltage' reminds one of Wire, although I don't think the band would ever admit that. 'Splat', 'Colours'and 'D thing'are just great rock songs that deserve a space on the shelf along with other great rock songs from a previous era like 'Strawberry fields' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again'"
1,Scratch This One from Your List!,"I bought the book, and can't escape giving it 2 thumbs down. The reasons: First, it was difficult to follow because Liberty didn't give any overview of why he was doing the material in the book, iu.e., the particular software. He just takes advantage of built-in features of ie5 to convert between xhtml and xml, etc. There is no larger picture, no understanding, conveyed. All we know is that Jesse Libeerty wants to put this book on the web and here is the way to do it. Avoid this one and get XML Bible instead with your hard-earned money."
3,Great information -,"These books have a series of articles about various medical topics. While I found it very informative, it is written for med students but it is not difficult to understand."
5,An excellent book,This is really an excellent textbook of Internal Medicine. Every physician should have access to it.
3,Neither here nor there,"I bought this book before my Medicine rotation (on a deperate, misguided ""what if I don't have enough information for this 'oh so important rotation'"" impulse) and regretted it. I barely used it, and I much preferred Current. I found that the information was not particularly easy to find. It read more like a storybook. I felt it was time-intensive but not detailed (not like Harrison's). However, it is really a matter of personal preference. Some may like the many diagrams, flow charts, and tables that are given. It also gives a quick review of the relevant basics (pathophysiology, anatomy, etc.). My advice: by the time you get to your Medicine rotation, you should already know your study style and should choose the most appropriate book in accordance. Go to the bookstore and compare the books and see which appeals the most to you."
2,Lame,There is really nothing special about this book. My 3 1/2 year old does like it but I groan every time I have to read it again. It is written with a conversational speech pattern and for whatever reason is full of half sentences and non-sentences. There are plenty of opportunities for kids to learn to speak and write poorly. There is no need to enshrine it in a book.
2,"The JavaScript Anthology: 101 Essential Tips, Tricks & Hacks","This book assumes a strong understanding of JavaScript by the user. This is confusing at times, as you try to understand what the author is taking about. I would have expected a book with this title to spell things out a little better. I found better tips and tricks on-line. W3C website is a better reference."
2,Little Information,"This book may have 101 Essential Tips, Tricks, and Hacks, but it fails at really explaining the language. I was looking for a book that would teach me the language. The content found in this book can just as easily be learned if you're good with a search engine. By no means a comprehensive book on Javascript."
4,Javascript 4 U,"This is an excellent next-step up from an introduction to Javascript and looks at its use in real world situations. You will need to be reasonably fluent in the language to get the best out of it.The book presents a topic as a question and then presents code to action that query as a solution, then goes through that code in a discussion section. This is where I have a relatively minor criticism of this book; the necessities of discussing the code do not always mesh well with the question and answer format of the layout.The authors have gone to great effort to ensure that the book is as up-to-date as possible, though this is a rapidly moving target of course, and detail how to ensure that the code will run on as many platforms as possible, rarely giving up and saying 'forget it..', though this proved necessary in a number of the more esoteric options and older browsers.A highly recommended read if you are looking for a quick solution, or a detailed understanding of what's going on."
2,"Beautiful, but not durable.","When I first received this dinnerware I was thrilled because it is beautiful. However, after a few months I realized that it was very fragile because it chips extremely easily. My children are grown so that's not the problem, it's just very fragile."
1,So disappointed,"I loved the design of these dishes and ordered a ton of them from Pfaltzgraff never worrying about the quality. Big mistake. These dishes seem to chip just sitting in the cupboard--I've never seen such low quality. Very sad to see a company that I have bought from for years (own multiple sets--Yorktown, Rio, and Winterberry) sell such an inferior quality product. If it had been allowed, I would have selected 0 stars."
1,"Chips,chips, and more chips!","I could not be more disappointed in this dinnerware, particularly since it bears the Pfaltzgraff name. I have never owned a set of dishes that chipped so easily. It is also difficult to use in the microwave as the dish heats up far more quickly than the food! I love this pattern, but I'm selling or donating all of it before it becomes completely worthless."
2,Doesn't live up to the name Pfaltzgraff,"I have to agree with the other reviews. The pattern is absolutely beautiful. However, the rims chip off very easily. I use them in the fall to set a lovely table. But now they look like seconds with chips all around the edges. I am very careful washing and handling them. sometimes when I take them out of the cabinet it seems there are even more chips than before. They're costly which is why I am upset too. I've had better results with the dollar store dishes. It's too bad I cant get a refund!"
4,Original Troma,"Directed by Troma Founder John Golden, this movie is one of those B-Movies people will either love or hate. From it's opening scenes of revelry over at the funeral of a hated relative, and scenes of mental patients whacked out on LSD, this film is at a gentler pace, but still up there with most of Troma's later output. It has always been one of my favourites. Unintentionally surreal, it has some wonderful moments - The Fat Guy gives a woman a wierd look and she assumes the worst (that he's propositioning her) and fetches some cops, upon seeing tons of money spill out of a suitcase he has swiped, she exclaims - ""I didn't know he had money"". In all, a very laid-back satire. I would like also to point out the excellent music by Leo Kottke - Trad Guitar god."
3,Not Silverberg's best work,"The war between Valentine and the shapeshifters continues to mount throughout the book, until it comes to a silly ending.Did Silverberg just get tired of writing? Complex problems seldom have such simple solutions."
4,A good end to a great trilogy,"This book was very enjoyable, the first being Lord Valentines Castle (A masterpiece), the second Majipoor Chronicles (A dissapointing compilation of short stories), and finally Valentine Pontifex, which was more in the ilk of the first in the series. The book was well written and held my interest from start to finish. My only minor criticism being that some of the earlier characters, whilst present were not explored further or made much use of in this the final rendition. Still a great book and worth a read."
4,Super Reader,"Valentine is still a nice guy, but not all that keen on the whole ruling thing, even those he has to. He has to try and deal with the shapeshifting metamorph plot to take over, their guerilla tactics, and other problems of government.He has drifted from his friends, and the metamorphs are not the only strange beings he has to come to understand. Certainly not as good as the first book."
5,Best book I've seen!,"This is the best book I have found so far on digital photography. If you know the basics and are looking for some in-depth info, I recommend you buy this book because it covers all aspects of digital photography well. I guess I would describe it as an intermediate guide, since one person complained that it is not a beginging book. Actually, I think that depends on the person and how much you want to learn about the topic. Also, it is easy to understand and unlike many books I have seen it is really well illustrated and the pictures helped me to understand the text--so the illustrations are well thought out. If you are shopping for a book on digital this one should be considered strongly."
3,Good but out of date,"I have checked this book out of the local library a couple times in the last year and find it a very good intro to the subject. The sections on modifying photos using software, especially Photoshop may be a bit more sophisticated than a general user looking for an intro may want but I find them very useful. The author introduces some very important issues like the fact that dust is a major problem with the sensors on interchangeable lens cameras and that because of the smaller sensor size relative to a 35 mm film image the image is 1.6 times bigger than with 35mm using the same lens. However, I would have liked to see info on selecting lenses for various photo settings. The thing that perplexes me most is that Amazon is selling the 2nd edition of this book however the one I am reading is the updated 3rd edition and among the other titles for sale here is the even more recent 4th edition! Why is Amazon still pushing this outdated edition? Don't be fooled, buy the 4th edition!"
2,Complicated for a beginner,I borrowed this from the library. I found it to be complicated. I'm a beginner in serious photography. I don't think it is a good guide for a beginner.
4,Dog Neurosis?,"Stephen Baker's title indicates that the dogs are the ones who are neurotic but I felt this hilarious book showed just how neurotic we humans are in our relationships with our dogs. The reading was light, fun and more acurate than most of us would like to think! A must for anyone who is sure their dog is ""human""."
5,Humorous and enjoyable,"Everyone in my family owns dogs, and we all laughed at the text and the graphics. The funny part is that so much of the book is true and one can really relate to what the author is describing."
4,A Researchers Guide,"So little is written about this primitive part of the world that this book takes on enormous importance for any researcher seeking guidance.The Shamanistic belief which motivates the primitive tribes of Amazonia are quite a contrast from the New Age Shamanism practiced in the civilised world. Above all else this is a textbook on Anthropology, not a heres how guide to Shamanistic practice. For my purpose this book was ideal. It provided me with an overview of Amazonia's native people and the evolution of their system of beliefs. Whether your interest is in native people, or the origins and practices of assault witchcraft I recommend this book."
5,I loved it,"I've read four sequels to the POTO and this is my FAVORITE one. If you ever wanted Erik and Christine to get together....this is the book for you!!! ""How"" they get together is very believeable after seeing the movie version which I LOVE."
4,Not bad...,"I bought this unit from the local Target for about $65(US). The overheating issue that others have described was a problem... After an hour or two of continuous use, I'd get some skipping. I was able to resolve the problem fairly easily. I bought a set of standard gaming dice, and a packet of adhesive velcro stickers.I used the velcro stickers to mount four dice on top of our 13"" TV (the velcro makes the unit removable if necessary), and additional velcro tabs on the underside of the DVD player. The end result is that the player is now has a solid half-inch of airspace below it. Made me feel like MacGyver, I have not had any overheating problems since.I was also able to hack the unit's BIOS such that it is now region-free, and I have COMPLETE control over fast-forwarding and chapter-skipping, including during those annoying FBI warnings. :)"
2,freeze frame,"I purchased this product about 5 months ago at a local retail store.. Does anyone have this problem.. I am over half way into the movie and the picture starts to freeze on me. The unit is very hot. The picture will not continue on, I need to shut off the unit and start at the beginning. Very disappointed with this product. Would love the hear if this has happened to anyone else. Trying to get intouch with KOSS now about this problem."
4,"Great value, but with caveats","I've played with one of these for about 6 months now. There is a bit of a heat problem as others have mentioned, I hacked mine to install a small fan (mpja.com part 12929 FN) and have not had problems since. I haven't found any format it won't read, from VCD to SVCD to CVD, DVD-R and -RW, JPEGs and MP3's on a DVD. (80 hours of music on one disk!) Outputs for composite video, S-video, and component video, as well as analog and optical digital audio. User interface isn't great, but it works. There are buttons for some functions on the player, but Koss didn't include enough to run a typical DVD, you will need the remote (which reduces its portability somewhat). Video filters are very sharp, which looks really good on some movies but introduces a little edge noise on some others. Runs on 12vdc, I've used mine in my small trailer with a LCD monitor, it's great to be able to take your movies and songs on the road."
4,TRAVEL FRIENDLY,"I am a Flight Attendant for a major US carrier (maybe you have flown in my Friendly Skies) and LOVE my Koss CDVD player. It is compact enough to fit into my Travel Pro bag and provides enough entertainment on layovers (hotel stays) while in cities that are lacking in entertainment. As mentioned in previous reviews, the player can get HOT but I have found that if i place it FLAT on a surface near a window or airflow pattern, it works fine. My only personal issue with this player is its connection cables. Most hotel televisions use coaxil cable connecions. The Koss CDVD player comes with S-Video or Split RCA Video/Audio Output Jacks. In order for me to convert these signals, I had to purchase a rather costly converter box (approx. $50.00). Bottom line, this is a great purchase for the person on the road with a huge DVD collection."
4,Good price but poor power supply,"The unit works very well, but is supplied with a poorly regulated power supply. The unit is rated at 12VDC, but the power supply delivers more than 15VDC which causes the over heating.Go to Radio Shack or the electronics accessories aisle in Target and buy a 12VDC output power supply rated for 1000ma (under $15). The player will run cooler and won't skip all the way through a 3 hour movie.Make sure you keep it away from other hot equipment and where air can move over it."
4,"Great semi-portable, all-around DVD/VCD/SVCD/MP3/JPG player.","It plays so many different CD media it's worth it.Only complaint is that it gets hot, but that's because of the cheap AC adapter...it fluctuates in voltage.SOLUTION: Buy a better AC adapter..."
1,Wouldn't Play various DVD-R brands,This won't play many kind of DVD-Rs. I am gonna return it!!! However liked its MP3 capability.
2,Relegated to the back woods,"Bought this one to use at home. Made sure to ventilate it well based on other customer reviews and we've never had the problem with getting shocked. However, it won't play any of our kids' Disney DVDs - guess they are just too loaded (special editions), none of the LOTR DVDs that we have, most of our Film Movement movies (too much extra with all the subtitles?), etc. So we've relegated it to our cabin where it gets used infrequently and only with older DVDs. Might be good as a backup, but don't count on it for every day use."
2,bad interface for MP3,everything looks good and works good....except that its hard to play MP3 cds.I would recommend for DVDs and audio CDs but not for MP3.
1,If it works...,"I opened the box, and fixed the cables, etc..What a surprise, it does not work at all!!!It comes a message that says ""NO DISC"" all times, and I live in SP - BRAZIL, there are no authorized dealer for KOSS here.It means, I will have to pay for repair!Take care with this unit!"
1,Don't Waste your time,"(...)After only two days of use, the unit wouldn't hold a disc. On the outside of the small black circle that holds the disc, there are some tiny silver balls on a metal spring clip that are supposed to hold the disc in place. The piece came loose and fell down inside the unit. Not only would the unit not read a disc, but it also damages the disc because it is not seated properly and scrapes around inside the unit.It's sad that they don't fix this problem. Otherwise it is a nice unit with some high quality output capability - but I wouldn't trust it to be reliable in the long term."
2,not happy with player,"I purchased it Jan 2004, worked fine up until a week ago. Same problem as above, didn't think anything of it until reading first review. It does get quite hot. If I knew that it was a known problem I would have unplugged it when not in use. It wasn't used very often. I usually read reviews if they are offered, don't know how I missed them this time.It says,no disc, and won't play after it makes this grinding noise. Very disappointed, I have dvd players in my bedrooms and parlor for a couple years, this one 6 months. I only purchased it for its compactness to fit on kitchen counter."
1,wimps out after a year,When I first got this DVD player from Target I thought it was a great deal for it's compact size & price. After having it for a year the player overheats and freezes about 1 hour into any movie. The remote has also stopped working so I can't see any of the special features. I cannot find a universal remote that will work with it ... Save your money!
1,"Unreliable, made in China player","I have liked this player for 3 months. However, right after the warranty period ended, the player stopped playing DVDs. It doesn't even play brand-new DVDs. I really regret this purchase."
1,Broken in less than a year,"Using for awhile now when I put a disc in, it attempts to load, then reports that there is no disc.I've tried about 10 different discs and have the same problem. Useless! and would cost more to fix than to buy another. What's worse is that I can find nothing about the product on Koss own website to see if it might not be easy to fix.Don't buy this."
3,Have hip hop model,I have the hip hop model of this unit what is basically the same thing except different color. Basically one of the other reviwers said to get another plug for the dvd player but I bought one and it had multiple voltage and I actually used less than 12 volts but it still got to hot and at the end ofthe dvd player it started to freeze. If this unit had a built in fan like the ps2 I would have rated it 5 stars because it would not have this overheating problem. Other than that problem I think it would be a cool dvd player.
1,Great Looking DVD player,Maybe I just got a bad one. I played one DVD on it. It would not recognize my cd-rs. It would say NO DISK when it had aa disk in it. I own it but its going back to the store I purchased it from. If it worked I'd be thrilled with it forthe size. It did seem awfully hot when I used it the first time.It was also kind of noisey when reading the disk. I have to wonder if there will be improvements in the compact DVd players since the small size seems relatively new and limited on the market. I think waiting until they are out for longer mightbe the way to go. I'd buy a full size DVD player until thesehave been marketed and reviewed more.
3,Gets HOT!,Most reviews note that the unit heats up - mine heated up and now will not read discs. It was cool when it worked and had great sound - but I am not sure what to do about it now!
2,"Worked for awhile, Glitchy","Touch n go with this unit, currently on the shelve at the Salvation Army."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COST !!!!!!!,"@@@@@@@@@@@ AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COST !!! @@@@@@@@@@@@The same exact thing that happened to one reviewer here, happened to me.I tossed this piece of crap out the window and it's rotting in the California desert somewhere.You know those little metal balls that hold the CD in place inside the player... It popped off!!GARBAGE design...It's not even real berring type balls. Best way to describe it is... A flat washer that fits in place with 3 little tabs that look like those Metal Berring Balls...The pressure from inserting/removing CD's.... pushed that washer off and it's loose.I tried to get creative, and took 2 really small/mini screwdrivers to pop the washer back into place...but it just pops back off when you put a CD in.Im real careful with my stuff and this is pure barbage.SHAME ON KOSS. I will never buy any of their products again. There should be no rating star for this product and Amazon should remove this completely from their site."
1,Cheap build quality - not recommended,"I only managed to get 4 months out of this DVD player before it started to go wrong - the screen permanently has grey lines all over it. This makes it unusable.It has a very cheap feel to it - very plasticky and feels like you will break it every time you use it.Initially I was pleased with the quality of the output - seems very clear. But as others have said, it is prone to overheating (which makes it impossible to watch a whole movie without problems)"
3,Cheap but Handy,"This thing pays my friend's pirated DVDs she brought back from a trip in China. Nobody else's DVD players understand them. This until also lets you view raw video and JPEG files burned straight to disk. It's also Very Tiny! It's got the digital outputs and component, etc. that big units have. The hidden cool thing about it is the AWESOME sound out of the headphone jack. Koss primarily makes higher-quality headphones, so the HF jack had to be great. It sounds way superior to my other CD players, so I actually take it to work for listening.Now the bad part... it's got a jumpy (although clear) image. The power supply is wrong, so replaced it with a Radioshack 12v one like the manual says (how did they mess that up?). It will overheat unless you sit it on top of a videotape so the vents are not covered on the bottom. Heat still an issue since heat rises (so why are the holes on the bottom???).Worth checking out, but don't pay too much!"
1,Skip it like it will skip your DVDs,"I bought this at target because it matched my orange psychedelic phone and because it was so portable.I had a console DVD player that I loved that never gave me a moment's worry, even when I left a DVD on stop and neglected it for a week.This isn't your DVD player if you're like me.It's noisy, too hot, and I can't even watch American beauty or John Q on it because it won't read them (any of them, I've tried returning my DVDs and getting new ones even).I thought my DVDs were old or improperly coded so I kept returning them to get replacements. It's the player. It's UNRELIABLE.I'm not going to go spend 15 dollars on a new adapter when I paid 100 dollars for the DVD unit.I have since replaced it with a 79 dollar Toshiba console unit that works FINE.It's nice that this Koss plays all regions and all formats save for avi/rpg/mov/mpeg.But it's not worth the high price tag. If they charged 45 dollars or less, ok. Skip this skippy little annoyance."
1,hottie alert,This thing has serious thermal issues. Do not buy if you intend to watch a full dvd movie all the way thru.
1,bad product,"bought this DVD player couple months ago, the description was somewhat miss leading - the ""hook up to computer"" part, you will need either buy some type of converter or use a S-Video, for those monitor does not have S-Video, you're out of luck.Mine broke down 2 weeks ago, with no indication, it just stop reading DVDs, any DVDs i put in, it says ""no Disc"". and weird thing is after i stop using it for awhile and almost decide to give up, it plays DVDs again... maybe this is the over-heating problems people were discussing in the previous threads. such a bad experience.i would not recommend this produce."
3,"Almost perfect, except",this little gadget will be perfect if it can also be powered by batteries or auto charger so that it can be portable and use with car screens on the road.
3,needs a little boost,"We love ours for it's cuteness factor, but it required some experimentation in the beginning. Our TV didn't have the same inputs, so we had to connect it via our VCR. Unfortunately, this little guy's signal just isn't powerful enough to make it through all that, and we'd get the same messed up/fluctuating picture some folks here have complained about. The Koss website recommended getting an RF Modulator We've been happy ever since. Of course, you'd probably be better off applying that dough to a fancier DVD player. . . Regardless, we've never had troubles with over heating or freezing, we just make sure to switch the power off when not in use."
1,Poor engineering,"The idea is a good one, but our experience is that most disks will not play properly on this machine. The picture fluctuates in brightness, up and down, and in the widescreen view there is a red flare above and below the image which, as described, waxes and wanes. Not fun at all. We are taking the item back to the seller. I would not waste time on the suggestions for the ventilation issue discussed in other posts. Thanks. Jack"
1,Garbage,"I have to agree with all the negative reviewers on this product--and I wish I had read them before buying. I was lured by the price, discounted further by an Amazon special a year ago.But the DVD player skipped and then froze halfway through the first movie, and it has rejected other discs all together.Furthermore, the unit does not hook directly to a tv; you'll need a conversion set from Radio Shack, which completely undermines the enticing value. Sure, you can get the unit for $30 plus shipping (after a mail-in rebate) but you'll need to spend another $30 to $40 for the conversion set.All together, this product was a complete waste. Don't bother."
2,"Was good, but is no longer","I purchased this DVD player because I didn't have room for a full sized one. It cost about $90 at the time I bought it in March, but has come down to less than half that price.Besides its small size, it plays discs from regions other than 0 or 1.The problem is that almost every disc I play on it either stalls or skips, so I was forced to purchase a full sized model and disconnect this Koss.In short, if you're thinking of purchasing this Koss portable - without a screen, save your money."
4,For size and price its fine,"I picked this up at a [local store]. It fits on top of my 13inch tv is small and cute.Its not the best player. It gets very hot, and some dvds miss like crazy making it impossible to watch (but I have watched several with no problem also)In some ways its better than my higher priced dvd player in the living room. It plays CDRs, mp3s and even picture cds. The remote has zoom.Its portable. I bought a PSONE case ... and it fits the dvd player nicely for when I go to friends homes who do not own a dvd player.I loved the size and price more than anything. It is perfect for a second dvd player for the bedroom or wherever."
2,DVD Player that periodically works,"I'm always worrying whether or not this DVD player will play a DVD consistently. Sometimes it plays it, and sometimes it doesn't. If a DVD player can't do its basic function: play DVDs, and do it well, then what's the point? You might as well pay an extra $20 and get a DVD player that will play DVDs consistently without skipping!This is definetly not worth the hassle."
1,What's the point?,"I don't get it.Why did this guy put out a CD of mediocre renditions of classic songs?To see himself on the cover with a bland blonde?I really don't get it.I LOVED his Christmas CD, so I expected this to be something like that.Not. Not even close.I truly don't get it."
1,The Cheesy Cover Shot sums it up,"Save your money.The cheesy cover shot tells all as the visual lead-in to where this CD goes musically.Slim Man attempted to re-do some unforgettable great jazz classics, for better or for worse, and brought cheese to the party. So what you get is cheese.This one is just not swingin'. The sound is ""nice"" enough as in OK for a lounge act. But to take on the great ones like Nat King Cole - and to take it seriously . . . come on!! We're talking JAZZ here. . . . it's gotta MOVE me. And this pap don't.There are two original songs on the CD where Slim Man, instead of trying to be Nat King Cole, is trying to be Slim Man! - yet even on these, the passion is zilch. ""Sweet Little Angel"" gives a hint of great songwriting - but after the first verse and chorus, enough already - - get me outta here!!!As for the other original, the title track ""For Now And Forever"", pa-leeeeze. It's no ""End of the Rainbow."""
1,Forget aboudit,"I wanted to like this CD.I tried to give the Slimman the benefit of the doubt.I listened a couple of times, again and again, but I cringe... yes, cringe ... again and again, it just doesn't stand up to what it portends. If you're gonna be Nat, you better be great, more than a lounge act.I must be honest, I am disapppointed, because in a live show the Slimman pulls it off well.But on this CD? This recording? Forget aboudit."
1,A Bland Entry for Jazz,"Fair but unexciting same old same old.Next, next, next, . . .This is supposed to be jazz. It's supposed to - make you FEEL something, MOVE you emotionally.Didn't work for me."
1,Worst of the Exam Cram's that I've read,"I'm very disappointed with this book. The english is poor. It's poorly structured. It's unclear. It's full of flaws, e.g. ""DNS must allow for dynamic updates to support Active Directory"". Have the authors ever heard of manually creating an SRV record?I was hoping for more because the other Exam Cram books I have read have been excellent (2 Active directory books, MS Exchange 2000 and Server 2000).My advice is that you avoid this book and rely on braindumps, the help files and the Windows 2000 resource kit documentation."
1,bad pitch,Thank goodness I bought this used as it was not worth the money. It was extremely basic and an obvious pitch to Amway MLM-sters. I found no value in this book or the others I bought from the same author.
1,This book offers little value,"I bought this book at a local offline store with great interest. As I read it from cover to cover, I was disappointed to find the flow of information just a fleeting thought by its author. The book very well serves the (ill)famous way of *mw*y corporation called: self-perpetuation without inspiration. It talks and talks of network marketing as a way of creating wealth .. but never tells how to build a network for marketing. No people skills, no personality development tips, no sales/presentation tips are ever given. If you really want to read something of value, read just the last 4 pages (I mean it!) .. all the rest just a preamble that promises some valuable reading to come up in subsequent pages. I am sure the author/publisher knows well not to allow *Search-Inside-The-Book Feature* at Amazon.com.My two words of advice: Keep-Away! (from this book)."
5,Good for poets of any age.,"I bought this small book years ago, in the bookstore of a museum. I was impressed with it and bought copies for my children - and my old parents. It's one of those perfect books, transcending it's own aims. It can help anyone - not just children - see more and write better. And for kids, it's an inspiration and a lot of fun. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
3,Doesn't inspire,"Well, darn. This book reads like a supplemental text for a poetry-writing unit. It will help a child fulfill a classroom requirement, but that's about it. You've got a kid writing poetry, but not reading it to anyone else -- there's no sense of audience at all. It's merely poetry as self-expression, rather than poetry as communication with another person. The child poetry used as examples is all free verse and isn't something you'd want to read for itself. And there's no mention that a body of poetry exists and might be worth reading for inspiration or even the pure joy of masters at work. In this book, there are only children doing assignments. The little line drawings are sweet though, and more interaction between words and pictures would have been helpful. Unfortunately, this book didn't make me want to write poetry, read poetry, OR go out into nature."
2,No es Tributo a Miles,"Hay que aclarar que esta es la presentación en la Expo mundial de Sevilla 1992 de guitarristas de jazz, en una primera parte si hay diferentes músicos haciendo temas de Miles pero despúes, hay otras interpretaciones que nada tienen que ver con la obra de Davis, ademas tecnicamente es la misma calidad que el ""bootleg"", que circula desde hace mucho tiempo."
2,not bad,the only reason for the 2 stars is because of the quality. the show itself is superb. great line up of artists. but the video is very blurry and the sound is bad. like something you can watch on youtube.get it if you like to see all the great artists jamming together.
1,Doesn't fit,Said it fit a Whirlaway but it's a tad too small. Guess I'll pull out the crazyglue and try to fix my old one.
3,Informative,"I agree with prior reviews that the book contains quotes that are repeated later in the book. In general however, i found the book interesting and informative."
3,It had to be written,"Even though I was only seven years old when this incident happened, I can recall people's reactions to it vividly, and I always associated both Washington and Tomjanovich with it. Previous reviewers were on the mark in their assessment of this book not being Feinstein's best, and that it repeats itself in spots, but it was a very interesting read, and I'm glad he wrote it.Without judging either man, Feinstein lays out both of their backgrounds in great detail, and also charts the course of their lives in the years since the punch. Both men are interesting sociological studies in their own right, and this book was definitely worth the time, both in writing and reading it, and for those of us who unavoidably associate them with the punch, the pages tend to turn themselves. It could have been written a little more elegantly, but if you're accustomed to Feinstein, this was a workmanlike effort that's worth a read."
2,Deja View all over again,"Like so many other reviewers, I concur with their repeated assaults on the repetitiveness of this book. I tend to read several books at a time, never having a problem picking up where I left off. However, with this book, I kept feeling that I was reading backwards with the rehashing of events and personalities time after time. A good story, yes, but a difficult read."
3,Unneccessarily long telling of story,"I thoroughly enjoyed A Good Walk Spoiled and A Season On The Brink, but The Punch was fairly disappointing. I think Feinstein did a fair job of retelling the story. He drew good quotes from the participants and witnesses and others. However, Feinstein constantly repeats himself. He could repeat one statement about 4 or 5 times. I thought it was quite annoying. Even the first chapter of the book was repeated throughout the story again and again. Though it was a shocking and sad story, maybe Feinstein realized he could not find any interesting subtexts although I agree with another reviewer that Feinstein should have talked to the coaches and others about why Washington cannot find work these days in the NBA. Not one of Feinstein's better efforts."
3,Two Out of Three,"This book really doesn't deliver everything it promises. Mr. Feinstein does a good job chronicling the lives of Rudy Tomjanovich and Kermit Washington both before and after the fight they were involved in on December 9, 1977. He does an excellent job getting different points of view of what happened that night during a basketball game between the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers.However, the author shortchanges the reader on the effect the fight had on the NBA and basketball. The topic isn't covered in any depth and consists of a sentence here and there.I did enjoy the description of how the NBA was in the mid-1970s, compared to today. Since I was a big basketball fan at that time, Mr. Feinstein's statements brought back a lot of memories."
3,""" The Punch""","""The Punch"" was an important event in the history of basketball. The author, John Feinstein did an okay job writing this book, but he kind of lost my interest after he started to repeat statements. ""The Punch"" is worth reading, because it told the event that changed the sport forever. If you are interested in basketball I recommend reading this book."
2,Redundant and Bloated,"Feinstein is a fine writer but you wouldn't know it from this. This really should have been a retrospective article in Sports Illustrated, not a full-sized book. I often thought there were printing errors in my copy because I was reading similar passages over and over. But no, I suppose Feinstein needed to get a decent sized book so he did what he had to do.But at least I have a better overall view of Kermit Washington. He's a really great guy in many ways, very charitable and caring. The problem is he's handled just about everything relating to ""the punch"" poorly. He blames another player, tells Rudy how much he's suffered in a rare meeting, sues the NBA, etc. etc. I think it was John Lucas who advised him to take responsibility and move on, not say ""I'm sorry, but..."". Unfortunately, Washington hasn't taken this advice. I hope someday he does, because there's no winning when you look for excuses and scapegoats in something horrific you've done."
2,Repetitive and Disappointing,"""The Punch"" left me disappointed. John Fenistein is a fine writer, but this book struck me as very repetitive in places....he's trying to give us the story of ""the punch"" from the angles of several of the participants, but the effect just doesn't come off. Give him credit for winning the confidence of Kermit Washington, Rudy T. and all the lesser players in this infamous incident, and all more points for trying to put the incident in a larger perspective, but what could have been a very fine book comes off as mediocre instead."
3,Poor editing,"The book is an interesting work about an event that I barely recalled growing up. However, it is the worst edited book I have ever read. There are at least six passages that are duplicated or only slightly rephrased throughout the book. It causes one to stop and exam whether he has already read that page. Not a first class job."
1,Quota to fill?,"This book is a complete ripoff. Feinstein must have a quota to reach because this book is just unbelievably poorily and laziliy written and edited. The repetition is so severe a 5th grade teacher would have given the writer an ""F"". Hopefully, this is an aberration for Feinstein but after reading this book I came away believing he's sold out = write a book, collect a check. Well, he won't be getting any of my $s anymore."
5,Excellent Buy,"This is an excellent tent. We bought it to replace a Coleman tent and couldn't be happier. There is plenty of room inside for 6 adults. It is simple to set-up, my wife assembled it together in about 10 minutes. We braved one night in the tent with rain and 30 mph wind gusts and the tent performed flawlessly, no leaks! I highly recommend this tent."
3,A Tent With Strengths,"We have owned this tent for four years, and have enjoyed it a great deal. The positives are: bang for the buck, size, and realtive ease of set-up. The primary short-coming of this tent is the zippers. We have experienced regular ""fabric chewing"" when using the zippers. This has led to progressive weaknening of the zipper integrity, and then complete zipper failure on one of the doors.Did we get our monies-worth? I suppose so. However, I am now in the position of determining if it is more cost-effective and worth the effort to replace a zipper, or to buy a new tent."
2,BIG disappointment!,"We searched and researched. The brand looked reliable, size was good and price was great. The first night we used it, it leaked terribly from dew -- NOT rain -- dew. Followed all the instructions, waterproofed it with the spray stuff. It still leaked. We had a rainstorm a few days later and it leaked like a faucet -- straight from the rain fly. We returned it and were sorely disappointed with this tent."
1,wenzel tent,"I have tented in a wenzel tent for years but this tent did not compare. First the dimensions were very deceiving, the two sides of the tent narrowed dramatically which made for very limited sleep space and we were 2 adults and 2 children. Worst of all the tent did not hold up under the rain!!! I would not reccomend this tent."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was so excited about this tent - it was big enough for 2 queen sized air mattresses, BUT the first day we set it up a pole broke - no wind, no rain...just broke. So Sad!"
2,Should have been better,"Listed as a strategic game, it only involves tactics. While some of the battles are fun, there are some serious flaws in the game - guns are too effective - able to mow down your mounted samurai with ease. Gunners will stand in and fight toe to toe with the mounted samurai. I wish this game had looked at Shogun to see how they handled some of the tactics of the battlefield. Wait until the game drops to 9.99. It might be worth a look then."
5,"Arg, this looks good.. >_<","My mom would never let me read it bc she would think that i started cutting or something. im only 11, too. so i guess idk she would freak out and stuff bc i want to read this. ANYWAYS, this looks REALLY good though."
2,Caution: TMI?,"My daughter had a problem last summer with cutting. She got the idea from youth group friends who were cutting and telling her about it. Then one of these friends recommended this Christian book. I never saw the book, but my daughter read it. Just yesterday my daughter thought to tell me that back then, she ""got alot of information and ideas of how to cut"" from this book. I just thought I would tell anyone thinking of getting the book for a daughter or son as a preventive, that it might not work that way. It may lead to a too-intimate knowledge and fascination with cutting, depending on the individual, of course. Just thought I would let you know of our experience."
1,"Triggering, Abrupt, and Unreal","THIS BOOK IS EXTREMELY TRIGGERING. DO NOT READ!(from a fellow self-harmer working toward recovery)This book has way too many details and is incredibly triggering to anyone with an addiction to self-harm. It also is ""educational"" in that it gives tips and hints about how to do it, how to hide it, and other stuff kids don't need to know.Second, the Christian aspect is so abruptly thrown into the end. It makes it seem like ""all you need to do is find Jesus and everything is shiny happy and FAKE. I'm a Christian, don't get me wrong, but I struggled even throughout recovery in spite of being a Christian. I STILL struggle, in spite of my belief. We still live in a world of sin and are sinful creatures and will be tempted. The idea that you would be ""cured"" of your self-harm after just a month is unrealistic."
1,BadSeller,"I bought the wrong book, and this seller refused to acknowledge my request for return. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
3,Need a little drama about a small town with big ideas?,"This book is banned which makes it all the more interesting. It is supposedly a mixture of truth and fiction. Lot's of drama and dirt. Probably wouldn't hold someone's interest if you didn't know the people in it, but if you do, you may look at them a different way after reading this."
3,Suppressed Sales,"Interesting book but poor sales led to the ""suppression"" theory. It has happened before and it is happening somewhere now. $300 for a used edition ? LMAO"
2,Mine has needed repair twice in 8 months,I dont know much about DVD players... this is my first... but i've had trouble with it.... it is on it's way back to the shop for the second time in 8 months...
1,Progressive Scan mode does not work...,"I purchased my DVD player last Christmas and shortly after I as well as my friends all noticed that the picture is to dark, in particular when there is a dark image It is instead all black... A week later I got the unit returned to me stating that there was no problem with my unit... The unit is also now missing screws..."
3,"Great features, but broken widescreen mode","I have a Sony Wega TV that has support for vertical compression for anamorphic DVDs. This worked flawlessly on my old Panasonic A310 player. I set up the P721M to Wide mode display so it will send the full squeezed anamorphic picture to the TV. So far I've tried 4 different anamorphic DVDs, and only one of them was displayed correctly. The ones displayed incorrectly show a horizontally squeezed image that fills the screen vertically. Reluctantly, I'm going to return this player."
4,very good dvd,The perfect dvd for those who also own a sony digital camera. You get the best of both worlds. A great prog. scan dvd and you can also view pictures on your tv.
1,If you don't expect alot you'll love this DVD,"I purchased this DVD mainly because of the memory stick, it was the only DVD player I found with this feature. You can forget about getting this DVD for play back of your pictures unless you shoot them at 1 mega pixal. I have a 5 mega pixal camera and it's worthless, second it won't play VCD's my old DVD player could even do that and it's 2 years old. This dog is going back tomorrow even the progressive scan feature pretty much [...]. I'm guessing the other people didn't push this unit to the limit, or maybe I'm asking to much of it?"
4,First DVD,"This is the first dvd player we have purchased - we have been resiting for a long time. We did not do a lot of comparison shopping, but this did seem to be a good buy for the money. We have been happy so far, and can not think of a single critisism. Not only does it look nice, but the image quality is really something. The additional bonus is that while we bought it on Amazon[.com] in the evening, we were able to pick it up the next morning from Circuit City, without waiting or dealing with sales people - it was a breeze. The added convenience of not having to deal with shipping here or back if there were a problem was a key factor for us, also."
4,"I like it, but have a problem.","I bought this player yesterday and tried quite a few titles in my dvd collections. I was happily supprised that this player was able to play some of the most difficult titles that my old dvd player was unable to play. The picture quality in progressive scan mode is excellent. I'm very happy with it.However, I did encounter a problem when I tried to play Gladiator - it just won't play it in the progressive mode. When I switched to regular mode, it was o.k. Probably, some of the video/audio setting was not set up correctly, I suspect. I need some expert advice to enlighten me."
5,AWESOME THING!,"PROBABLY SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE ME. I HAD RESEARCHED ALL KIND OF DVD PLAYERS INDLUDING SONY, JVC, PHILIPS, FOR OVER A MONTH. FINALLY I GOT THIS SAMSUNG.THE SCREEN QUALITY IS JUST AWESOME, EVEN BETTER THAN SOME VERY HIGHER PRICED ONES. AND IT DIDN'T HAVE NOISE LIKE OTHERS. AS SOON AS I HOOKED IT UP (WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE), I PLAYED IT AROUND, CHECKING EVERY FUNCTION I COULD FIND OUT. EVERY THING WORKS JUST MARVELOUSLY! YOU GOT TO SEE WHAT IT CAN DO WITH PROGRESSIVE SCAN THING!WHAT CAN I SAY?I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED!IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTHY TO SPEND OVER A MONTH!"
1,Piece of *!#p!,"Progressive scan never worked correctly from day one. Didn't wantto get into shipping back and forth to the repair center, so bought aPanasonic replacement (that works perfectly) and threwthe Samsung unit in with my soup cans and bottles for recycling.Never again Samsung, ... never again ..."
2,Played it once in Tai Chi class...period.,"Had it not been for the sound of feedback three quarters of the way into the album, it would have been a good Tai Chi background music/nature sounds cd. I think the artists were trying to mimic the sound of blowing wind. Could have done without the sand mix in with the wind, though. It sounded like it was hitting the mic. It disrupted the class with laughter from the students. Oh well, moving on."
2,Too small,"I wish I read the reviews before ordering. I have the Gund Elmo puppet, which is great, so I figured the Ernie puppet would be the same as Elmo, but the Ernie puppet is way too small for most adults. I'm a man with fairly large hands, and Ernie's shirt barely covers my full hand. The picture is very deceptive - the puppet is much smaller than it appears. The overall fit is off as well. When I use the Elmo puppet, I can have elmo pick up balls, control toy cars, etc., but it's very difficult to maneuver Ernie's arms. Very disappointing product. I am going to try to return to Amazon."
2,Too small for parents,"I have a 1 year old daughter who loves it when I make puppets talk to her. I have really had a hard time finding puppet in the local stores, so I decided to turn to the internet. I used to have some Sesame Street puppets when I was a kid and thought that they were great. So I figured this would be a perfect puppet to use with my daughter.Here's the thing. The opening into the head of this doll is too small to get a grown ups hand into and still be able to operate the puppet with any ease. Also, the mouth is very stiff making it hard to open and close.The overall look of the puppet is good, but it isn't very user friendly. Needless to say, I am pretty disappointed in this product and wish that I wouldn't have bought it.(...)"
2,it's made wrong,"these puppets are sooo cute! I bought ernie and bert and the craftmanship is fantastic. unfortunately they're made wrong (wrong dimensions). its hard to open and close the mouth, its very stiff. the arms are way too long for your fingers to articulate them. there's no way you can move the mouth and the arms at the same time. its too bad because they're adorable otherwise. my 20 month old hasn't shown much interst in them."
4,Very nice!!,"Very happy with this puppet, bright colors and good material, just a littler bit small from expected but still happy. I really like it."
3,Ernie Hand Puppet,"Purchased as a gift. I cannot submit this review without a rating so ignore these ratings. I have not used this toy. It came as advertised, on time in new packaging."
4,Teens will really embrace this book,"Teens will really embrace this book, the suspenseful fast paced format, that often feelings like running will really hook teen boys especially. I thought this was well done; I felt empathy for Chance and liked how he took responsibility for his actions. I had some problems with the ending some of it felt a little unrealistic. The settling of Seattle and the Puget Sound was also well done and very authentic."
5,Great!!!!...........,Carl has done it again! This book is wonderfully written. I'm a first time reader of his book and i have to say i loved it! I think that this book is good for anyone who really wants to be in a hero.
3,In-ground dog fence system,Somewhat disappointing. We've had to make numerous calls back to the company to resolve problems. The upside is that their customer service representatives are FANTASTIC and have been a pleasure to work with.
2,Teeny tiny,"Beware if you think you're buying a full-sized paperback book! This is one of those ""mini""books, about 3 inches X 3 inches!"
3,Atlanta Child Murders,Was a bit disappointed with how the book looked but it did serve it's purpose.
1,do not buy! overpriced and malfunctions,"i got this overpriced alarm clock because it is modern looking and white so it fits into my house design very well, it was fine for a few months.however, NOW every other day it totally resets itself. just like BAM the alarm is gone the time restarts. the battery backup has been replaced so thats not the issue.its simply faulty.and if your normal like me you dont keep reciepts so there is no way to go through the BS forms you have to fill out to pay the shipping for memorex to get a warranty replacement.now ill have to go around knowing i wasted alot of money on a POS alarm clock and at the same time remember to never buy memorex products again."
1,Busted after 2 months,"Like the reviewer below me, a small electric 'shock' busted the system.I was playing my ipod in it and I walked over to raise the volume. A tiny shock occurred (like when you touch another person while standing on a rug). This small shock shut the system off and now it is irreversibly broken.Please do not buy this item unless there are no rugs in your home and you live in a humid environment. If you already have one, make sure you do not touch it while it's on !"
2,Don't buy this!!!!!!,"The back light is too bright. It's like having a night light that you can't turn off. The alarm is awful. The alarm volume starts out low (level 1) and increases every few seconds up to the max level of 12, unless you roll over and turn it off. Say good bye to listening to the weather and traffic reports in the morning while in bed because you have to race to turn this thing off before the volume reaches FULL BLAST! If you could just turn this feature off this device would be ok. Whoever designed this feature was an idiot!"
1,Extremely disappointed for many reasons,"This clock radio is disappointing for many reasons.1. The dock connector piece is flimsy and broke within one week.2. The design is very poor and it's hard to see the buttons. The font type, size and color are hard to read. The location of the buttons are on top, so if you have your clock radio on a taller dresser, you have to tilt the unit towards you to be able to set your alarm, change the volume, etc.3. I am unable to tune into most radio stations. Most stations have lots of static and are unpleasant to listen to.4. The 2nd alarm broke and I'm only able to set one alarm.5. The sound quality isn't very good.I recommend buying an iHome instead. It's similar in price, but, without all of the problems that the Memorex has."
2,Should've spent the extra $20.....,"Thank goodness I have back-up alarms, b/c this machine has only turned on my ipod 1 out of 4 mornings. The ipod icon and the volume setting come on, but the ipod remains in charge mode. I've read and re-read the instructions and I don't see anything about how to specifically set your ipod except to make sure it is on.Other than that, I'm in agreement with all the other negative reviews I've read on here. When I looked up articles that listed the best ipod alarm clocks, the iHome, about $20 more, was the one most highly recommended on every site I went to. I chose this instead of the ihome b/c cause it was $20 cheaper. Learned my lesson. I'm taking it back to Target tomorrow."
1,do not buy! it worked for only 3 days,"This product appears to have some serious design flaws. I only used the radio function, and for three (3) days it worked just fine. Then the next day I turned it on and no sound came out of the FM radio. When I tried the AM band, I heard only static, as if no stations existed within range. Since I never moved or jostled the unit in a way that could damage it, the best explanation I can come up with is that a connection broke (spontaneously?) on the circuit board somewhere, probably involving the digital tuner. Needless to say, I returned it and purchased a basic portable stereo for ~$30. You should definitely avoid this product."
1,Lasted 5 months,Don't buy this! It lasted 5 months then stopped working. I guess this is why it only had a 3 month warranty.
1,electric shock magnet,"I bought this clock radio in September, and 4 months later, the unit is dead. Since we bought it, when I would go to set the alarm or turn off the radio,etc, there would be an electric shock. This would set the clock to 12:00 each time. This happened off and on for a while. Then last night, the alarm 2 set button wasn't working. And this morning, none of the buttons worked! I had to unplug it, and after plugging it back in, only half of the buttons are working. It's great that they have a 90 day warranty, but you're out of luck if it stops working in the 4th month! Call me crazy, but a clock radio should work 4 months later."
4,satisfactory,"I like this product. It's more attractive than the iWake and cheaper, too. The sound quality is good and the controls easy. My only complaint is that whenever you turn the iPod or radio on, the volume starts out half way up, which is way too loud. Every time I turn it on, I have to reach for the volume down button immediately. There are two alarms, which is very nice for setting a weekday and weekend alarm, for example."
1,junk...,"actually, the sounds isn't too bad... that's one positive. And it looks pretty cool.the negatives:-no adapter for my ipod nano included-no volume presets for radio or ipod-no radio presets-the biggest complaint: when I plug in my ipod the clock resets to 12:00. The irony is that the only good features (the two alarms) are rendered useless by the fact that I have to reset the clock every single day.-WORTHLESS customer support. They just recomended that I return the item to the store where it was purchased--which is 220 miles away from where I live--and refused to provide assistance with a poorly-designed, defective product.There are plenty of other competitive products out there... It's a shame that I wasted my money on this one."
2,Not What it looks like in the picture,"The sound is great, but the 2 major draw back are that 1 it keeps telling me that my ipod can't charge with the accessory, and 2 the Number screen doesn't even show any numbers. Its just blank. Great sound, but major drawbacks."
1,cord broke off...,"...and there's no way to (easily) fix. given all of the horrible reviews, why would i try? am on my way to dump into the garbage can."
2,"Too much ""wimp factor""","Sorry guys - I loved Lex Rex and Chronometree, but this one has only a few moments as good. The final straw had to be the ""longer than"" song. Once I heard that, I immediately removed the CD from my player, lest someone in my building hear it and proceed to kick my ass (I felt kind of like Martin Prince of the Simpsons at that point...). Too bad - so much potential."
4,Great introduction to blogging for the true novice,"I picked up this book after deciding that I was going to turn my website into a blog. I had no backround in blogging and this book is geared towards the novice. Blogging is explained and then they go in to detail on using either Radio Userland, Blogger, or Movable Type to get your blog up on the web. The order of the chapters is kinda crazy to me but you can read them in any order you like I suppose. By the time I was done with the book (2 evenings) I was up and running under Radio Userland blogging away like an old pro. I borrowed this book from the library and only had it two days and wouldn't need to look at it again as all the information included is available on the web as well."
3,ESSENTIALLY FOR NOVICE BLOGGERS,"With its slow-and-steady pattern, ""Essential Blogging"" is the book that will initiate novices into the blogging ritual. It highlighted every important tactic used in today's Weblog: including vital hints on how to select, install, and run blogging utilities. It also advices its reader on how to integrate random entry display with a blog front-page.This book has a set of easy-to-follow rules on how to create, maintain, and collaborate weblogs. And for those who already know what they want, it provided guides which would enable them set-up their systems.However, its worst offence is that a great chunk of its information were overtly summarized: thus, ensuring that its reference-value is curtailed. Also, it failed to expatiate on blogging essentials like: Greymatter and Live Journal.Still, the fact that it served nourishing tips and code examples, raised its profile. It is a good starting-block for weblog beginners; but, expert bloggers may afford to overlook it."
2,Typical book to borrow from your local library,"Essential Blogging focuses on a few blogging tools (Blogger, Radio Userland, Movable Type and Blosxom). If you are a ""blogger"" already, only the parts that refer to your favorite blogging tool are interesting. Most of the subjects will be familiar. You will have learned it by yourself after using your specific blogging tool for a few days...I really learned some new things (I use Blogger Pro) - but I don't think it's worth buying the book. Reading it from your local library? Absolutely worth it!For new bloggers, who want to get an overview of the tools, the first chapters are really nice. But the chapters describing the tools are too specific to be of any help.One other thing: the continuous development of additions to the blogging tools makes all blogging oriented books ""obsolete"" when they hit the shelves."
5,The Usual Excellent O'Reilly Job,"Before I read this book, I had never heard the term ""blogging"" before. But as I read the book's first chapter, which gives a good overview of what it is, I realized I'd seen ""web logs"" on several different sites. So now I have some familiarity with blogging.The rest of the book is devoted to various software to be used in setting up and maintaining your web log. Among the products decribed in detail are Blogger (and Blogger Pro in a later chapter), Radio UserLand, and Bloxsom. Each of their features are explained in good detail, with lots of screen shots included. Not quite a tutorial, but still good explanations of what each product does.It's piqued my interest in setting up my own ""blog."""
2,"Poorly Edited, Minorly Informative","The book does say that if you are currently running a blog, a lot of the information contained will not be new, so I understand they are marketing to a newbie crowd. However, even for newbies, I really don't think the information contained therein is very useful. Mostly do to poor editing and layout. For example, in the first chapter they include screen shots to show you what a blog looks like.. seems reasonable enough. However, when the author is talking about including a hyperlink to whatever page his post may be talking about, they give full page wide screenshot of the word ""Link""... it's just this big empty white space with a tiny word... ""Link"" just floating in the middle of it. Totally unhelpful."
3,Helpful for the beginner.,"This was a curiosity read. I would consider myself a beginner blogger and found some of the contents to be useful and some of it not.Overall this book is an introduction for a novice. You get a discussion for blogger, moveable type, radio userland, blogger pro, and a couple I had not heard of called blosxum and blagg.I read the chapters on blogger, blogger pro and radio userland and found them interesting to a degree. I skimmed the rest.I found the chapter on tools to be the most valuable as I really don't have any. I am looking into some of them to streamline my blogging efforts.The final chapter contains quotes from various bloggers. I really don't see the value of it and wonder if it's just space filer.Overall, this is not a bad book but I don't think it will remain on my shelf after my skills and knowledge improve."
3,Not enough code for me,"I bought this book hoping for a little more code (html or java) to help me design my own weblog, but it left me hanging. It gives a great description of what a weblog is and how to get it up and running, but lacks in design elements."
1,"Essential online docs, you mean","This was the first disappointing O'Reilly book I've ever read. It's essentially a rehash of docs available online, and offers few, if any, new insights. Do not buy this book; rather, borrow it from the library or, best of all, visit the Web-based help docs for your preferred publishing system."
4,Good basic work on survey research,"I used to teach a graduate course on research methods. This was one of the texts that I would assign--and I always enjoyed working with it. In addition, students tended to respond well to this book.Pluses: it is accessibly written; it is rather brief, so it does not overwhelm the reader. On the other hand, sometimes it would have been nice to have a wee bit more detail on certain issues (but that is a small point, after all).The book covers the basics: sampling, nonresponse--and how to address this; methods of collecting data; designing questions (a key, but often underlooked part of the survey process); evaluating survey questions and the instrument as a whole; interviewing; preparing data for analysis; ethical issues in survey research; etc.One key issue: total survey design. By looking at each stage in the process and trying to reduce error, one can enhance the confidence in one's findings and results.Overall, a fine work. . . ."
4,Good book,I purchased this book for my survey design class. It was clearly written with very useful examples. I especially liked the sample design section.
2,"OK foundational knowledge, fairly boring","This book serves as a basic foundation for the planning of survey research. There is not much else to say about it. Certainly, Survey Research Methods is not extremely captivating and there are other books that are far more specific. This was the book used in my survey research methods class in graduate school alongside two other books (Principles of Exposure Measurement in Epidemiology and Methods in Observational Epidemiology) and I often found myself wondering what it really contributed, given us using those three books. Maybe if you need something that is just a quick read and crash course this book would be good for you, although it probably won't seem very quick."
2,boring to read,"While the content of this book is probably very good (I haven't had to read other books on this subject for a fair comparison), the delivery of said content is extremely boring and outdated. The book is basically composed of paragraphs with very little use figures, tables, exhibits, etc. It's just paragraph after paragraph. My biggest issue with this book, however, was the fact that I had to constantly skip the inline citations that were everywhere! One example: a 4 sentence paragraph with 3 citations. It was very distracting to read and it took away the focus from the material to, instead, reading last names and years. I do not recommend this book whatsoever."
5,Good product.,"This was bigger than I expected, which was good, considering it was for my stray kitten and her transitioning cage. She adapted to it well and since it hangs, it left more floor space for her."
5,Huge!,"I bought this for my boyfriend's ferrets, and they love it! It's big enough that they both sleep in it comfortably, with room to spare! It's held up pretty well (they've had it for a few months now), and they seem to love it! Fast shipping and a good quality product. As a bonus, it's cheaper than many other smaller hammocks out there. Overall a great deal."
3,Ferret Hammock,The item was definately not what I expected according to the description. The hammock was smaller and not very thick.
2,not a good Criterion release,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Sword of the Beast"" known in Japan as ""Kedamono no ken"" is the story of a swordsman who kills a minister in his clan in attempt at reforming, but his former comrades then attempt to seek revenge.The Criterion DVD contains no special features and is therefore a bad release.The DVD is available by itself or in a box set with ""Samurai Rebellion"", ""Samurai Spy"", and ""Kill!"" I suggest getting the box set version."
5,A Decent Flick,"I bought this DVD on a whim while in my local shop. I figured, hey, it's got 2 hot chicks in it, and 2 guys who are pretty funny. I was right. I laughed the whole way through this movie. It's got a decent plot, good solid characters who are funny, and a quirky way about it. If you're into movies like ""How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog"", ""An Everlasting Piece"", or ""100 Girls"" then this movie is your cup 'o tea."
4,appealing... I think,"I honestly don't know why I'm giving Scorched such a high rating. It wasn't particularly funny, it was only sometimes interesting, the beginning of the film was nearly unwatchable because it was so awful, and yet, here I am giving the movie a 4 out of 5 rating!It's about a bunch of people who work at a bank who develop their own ways to steal the money out of the safes. The story is actually carefully and somewhat intelligently put together, and some of the scenes near the middle of the film were really good (such as that one guy leaving his fancy home with a shotgun and walking down the street going after the people he believes are throwing eggs at the house, not to mention his little dog was hysterical too).A very good moment at the very end of the film before the credits start rolling. I loved that ending. This is one of those ""good enough to waste an hour and a half"" type movies and not a classic case of comedy genius or anything."
3,"Off base, irreverent, but fun.",This movie plays off the indie irreverence style but has some interesting characters in a somewhat warped life. The movie has some funny scenes that keep you engaged as they develop character roles of a group of people lost in heir life and seeking new direction and purpose. Ironically they all reach similar conclusions over the same weekend and a parallel character study ensues. . . . a good watch for John Cleese or Woody Harrelson fans but also for those wanting an amusing diversion.It will make you laugh.
4,Pretty Funny,"Not quite as funny as Office Space or Dumb & Dumber, but still brings out some good laughs."
3,Good popcorn flick,"This is a good popcorn movie, just don't be expecting too much. I was surprised that it was as good as it is, without using bad humor or offensive stuff to make it funnier. It's about a variety of characters in a small town. Three of them work at a bank, and are less than content with their jobs. They all decide to rob the bank, all on the same weekend. So basically the movie just follows each of them, their motives, and the execution of their plan. Good cast overall, it was a fun movie but nothing much to write home about."
2,Waste of a good cast,"Scorched has so much potential, with a great cast but it doesnt deliver. The plot involves 3 bank employees train to rob their work. The laughs arent there, and Cleese (who's usually funny) is wasted."
1,Boring movie!,"Please don't waste your money and buy this movie. I'm a big fan of Alicia Silverstone. I have all of her movies. Unfortunately, this movie has a bad story line and it is really lame. Please save your money and buy her other movies like True Crime or Clueless.Thanks!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,This was a very boring and slow-moving predictable movie. Nothing stands oy performance wise or plot wise. We have all seen this mishmash before.
4,cold weather test,"We had our clock for six months now and it has worked accordingly. We're in the middle of January and the transmitter did register a -21 degree reading, but the next day it didn't register a -22 but the letter L. The readings are close to the airport readings pretty much all the time. I'm pleased with this product"
2,"we bought three clocks, and two of them did not work","We bought three of these clocks, since the price and features seemed attractive from the description on Amazon. When the clocks arrived at our home and we set them up, two of the three failed. One clock did not function at all when we put in the batteries, and the second clock stopped working after two days. We tried changing batteries and we re-read the instructions, but, alas, the two clocks were not happy campers. We also found that the temperature readings were different by between three and five degrees, even when the clocks were physically right next to each other. My conclusion is that these clocks are very low quality."
1,unhappy,"This unit worked great for 10 months, then the outdoor temperature quit reading. I changed batteries, still would not not read. Ordered a new sensor for about $30.00: still did not work. Contacted Lacrosse for support and they gave me the run around about batteries (which I had already changed three times) until the warranty ran out. I did not contact Amazon which I probably should have. Point is, do not count on Lacrosse for anything,"
4,Interesting,Probably only of interest to three groups of people:1: Historians2: Writers3: NerdsIt will give you a good idea of how much language has shifted in the last couple centuries. You'll also get a feel for how the individual writers whose letters are included wrote and thought. My only serious complaint is a lack of explanatory text around each document like a short summary of 100 or less words and maybe a topic index.
5,Scriptural Disputes Settled According to Catechism,"This is marvelous background to the Formula of Concord and applying it to today's polarity over equally sounding Scriptural proofs.Having purchased this early on in seminary, and never reading all of it, was inspired just recently by study group on Formula. Background had this as major contributor, however, Chemnitz and gang resolved that sermon format was not the best, so rewritten.What is attractive and solid about these six sermons on controverted doctrine is his reference to Luther's Small Catechism for the answer to finding out how to discern equally sounding controverted positions. Before someone objects to Catechism being over Scripture, one must realize what Catecism is: Asks question, then answers from Scripture. This is solid and enlighenting and pertinent to today's controverted issues."
5,A fine book on the Burma gemstone source.,"The definitive book on Mogok, Myanmar (Burma) and it's gemstones. This large format book is copiously illustrated with colour photos taken by the author. Not many of us have been to Mogok as it has been closed to foreigners for many years. Mr Themelis has received special permission to go to Mogok many times during the years it took to write his book.A fascinating look into the history, customs and lives of the people, in what may be the most important gemstone producing area of the World."
3,On my second read now...,"I first read this book when I started running a few years ago and thought it was just short of bizarre, but also pretty interesting in certain spots. I just received the book as a present and am re-reading it with 3 years running experience under my belt. I still think it's odd, maybe even more so. I find Heinrich's teutonic fascination with genetics and domination just a wee bit bizarre, and unfortunately, I'm a happy vegetarian so his intense focus on consuming animals, as well as grinding them up for research purposes nearly unreadable passages.That said, he's a successful ultramarathoner--and that requires nothing short of obsessiveness, and obsessiveness to a degree I will never know. So I also take my hat off to him for his dedication to the sport. On that front, it's an interesting read."
3,this is the same book as racing the antelope,"well, i do not understand why the title of this book changed. thanks to the book return policy or we, readers will end up buy same book twice."
1,Bea,"Not sure what I expected but this certainly wasn't it. I didn't even finish the book, it just didn't hold my interest."
2,Having trouble finishing this book,"Reading the other reviews, I must be the only reader who did not appreciate this book. While the book may be very interesting, it's not what Amazon advertised it to be nor is it what I expected from the title. Maybe I just haven't gotten far enough along in the book. But I didn't expect an autobiography, especially one about an author whose young life sounded very difficult. What I expected was a book more along anthropological or historical explanations for the reasons humans run. I expected a continuation of the explanations that were described in Born to Run. In fact, Born to Run was the reason I purchased this book. Maybe I'll give it another try in the future but for now I'm going to continue my search for a book I can't put down."
3,Improves during the second half,"The first part of the book, the author's childhood, is too poetic from my point of view. But then he actually embarks on a journey through the physiology of endurance in multiple animal species that is very, very interesting for long-distance runners."
1,A mediocre biography,"I bought this book expecting a book mostly about how humans evolved to run from a scientist's view, but instead got mostly a personal biography in an uninteresting writing style"
2,Boring,"I love running and I was looking for something new to read about running. This books just wasn't for me. I read about half of it. The author's story is pretty interesting and if the book was just that, I probably would have finished it. The book is more about animals, their aerobic capabilities and their evolution. Too much animal kingdom science for me."
4,In-depth Study,"A little cerebral, but I enjoyed the focus and how he relayed the experience of his past with the training. Will look at his other works in the future!"
1,lost money,"I recently purchased ""Vietnam War Stories"". The price was right ($3+) and being a Vietnam veteran I collect Vietnam dvds and movies. This product was ""used"" but indicated ""Like New"". It consisted of 2 discs. Disc 1 would not go past the Main menu. Whether I selected ""Play all"" or tried to play it by episodes, it would not go past main menu. Yesterday I sent an email identifying my delima. I got a response back in Spanish. I've purchased several used dvds thru amazon and Hastings. Ninety nine percent of the time there was no problem. But this disc just won't play. Disc 2 plays fine. I guess I am just out the money. It would cost me another $2.98 to return it, to get a refund for the $3.98 I spent on it. I have had pretty good success with Amazon and as of right now will continue to do business with them, but I was very dissatisfied with this transaction since I am disabled and live on a very limited budget.Vietnam War Stories"
1,Inexpensive and deservedly so,"I purchased this to serve as a CD changer which could also function as a DVD player. The DVD capability was an after thought but the price was the attraction. However,it will not advance to the next CD even though Samsung tech support assures me that it should. It skips parts of the CD that it plays. This includes both regular CDs and CD-Rs that play on other players. It did play the one DVD that I tried in it. I will shop for another CD changer. The Samsung is fodder for the next garage sale."
5,Perfect Reference on Spectroscopy,"The undergraduate physical chemistry lab course required us to perform at least 2 experiments on spectroscopy. Experiments could be drawn from infrared spectra, electronic-vibrational absorption spectrum, Raman spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility of transition metal ions in solution.While introductory physical (quantum) chemistry course only gives students an overview of spectroscopy and its applications, this book provides excellent information about different types of spectroscopy and their usages in laboratory. Many will find it very useful to consult this book before proceeding on spectroscopy experiments. It will also serve as a reference tool for practicing chemists and professionals who need a refresher in the subject.It covers basic spectroscopy techniques, vibrational spectroscopy, rotational spectroscopy, infrared, Raman on diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules. One great tool."
5,If music be the food of love.........,"........then the music in question has to be ""Innersense"". What a fantastic CD this is. Tear-jerking, breath-taking and heart-wrenching in all the right places, this is electronic music at its very best. This beautiful album hasn't been off my stereo since I got it. Very, very highly recommended!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER I NEVER RECEIVED MY PACKAGE,"I contacted him/her twice and recieved absolutely no response, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM if you don't wish to pay for something you'll never get.I am angry and frustrated that I recieved no response and was forced to file a claim with Amazon."
5,delightful,"This is a wonderful, short play that I'm sure most can read in a short sitting. It's a highly entertaining, witty drama. Any fans of the band the Smiths will certainly snicker with glee when they find where Morrissey got some of his lines from..."
2,Confusing Story that never gets going,"Having read and studied this book at school. i can say that i did not like this book. some aspects are totally unclear, for example Geof's dubiuos sexuality. The open ending leaves the reader feeling disatisfied, and annoyed, it left me thinking, is that it? i don't recommend reading the book. The storyline is basic, and the most irratating feature of the book is the arguementative relationship between Helen and Jo. The best bit though is definetely the relationship between Jo and Geof"
5,WORDERFUL !,"Despite you're a great fan of Goya (which I am !) or not, Carlos Saura movie is a masterpiece. One should notice the background scenes of the movie, they're paintings of the great spanish master.Absolutly fantastic!Cristina Nunes, Brazil"
5,I've missed this series!,I was so excited to find this on Amazon at a great price. I bought it used but it came in AMAZING condition. The tape itself has 2 episodes on it. I'm so happy to relive my childhood adventures with Ariel! Great addition to any Princess collection.
5,Amazing,"This film is amazing. The footage makes the launch more exciting than film of any space shot I've ever seen. Besides that, this documentary is a complete time capsule of 1969, a unique year in a unique decade. It's rare to see a momentous event shown in all its context - music, politics, war, hair, psychedelia... Beyond both these feats, the film is art of the highest order. Breathtaking. It should be required viewing for all Americans. In schools, it should be shown for its historic value alone. But students of history, space exploration, film and life will all be enlightened by watching Moonwalk One. Do not miss it."
5,"Superb then, still superb","I first saw this remarkable work when it first came out, almost 40 years ago. It bowled me over, not only for the historic event it so vividly and engrossingly reported but for its cinematic brilliance. This was cutting edge filmmaking, using images, juxtapositions, music, and words in a way I hadn't experienced before. So I was a little afraid to see it again last week, in this new edition. So many films I loved as a kid now seem bland, old-fashioned. But, boy, not this one. Amazingly, it's still cutting edge filmmaking, as fascinating and stirring now as it was then."
5,Great book. Great Condition.,this book was suggested by a counselor so we expected it to be good. The seller truthfully described the condition of the used copy being advertised and provided great packaging and fast shipping.
5,Like New Parenting Book.,I certainly received the book within a nice time frame & packaged perfectly. . The book is more than like new. It is new and does not look like a page has been turned.
3,Family Rules? Family Rules! (Yeah structure!),"If you, as parents, are in good shape, but your family-life with kids is not, this book can be of real help. The F.A.M.I.L.Y. program has been used with many families -- even 'those whose kids have to go off for residential treatment -- and so it's not just upper-middle-class helicopter-parenting info.The author is quite proud of himself, which can be a little tough to take, and I don't think we'll go for the whole program, but these ideas particularly strike me:l. Parenting is a benevolent dictatorship, not a democracy. Invite kids input. You decide.2. Clear Family Rules/expectations are helpful. Several useful & extended examples given.3. Credits for Random Act of Kindness, helpfulness, etc.4. Chores & contributions made clear.5. Parents held to same rules as kids -- requirements for 10 year olds, 16 year olds & 40 year olds may differ.6. You keep track of where you are, and that helps.Worth checking out."
5,Help for parents,"This is a very easy read with a little humor and tons of great ideas that have already had the bugs worked out. It puts in writing a very practical and easy to fit into ANY family situation plan of action. Parents are no longer the bad guy who solely carry the burden of discipline - it now falls on the shoulders of the child. Tonight our 14 year old son finished an unpleasant good habit card and declared he was NEVER going to get that one again. When reminded that it will go back into the deck and eventually would be one of his good habits again, he said he had a plan already worked out to not get it again - just by being good every day!! That was what we are working for! None of us are perfect, but this is working! Thank you!"
1,Drinking Mexican Beer Equals Baja Culture?,The book was a disappointment for me. I brought this book with me on my trip to Baja thinking it would enhance my experience during my travel. But this book turned out to be stories after stories of a bunch of gringos drinking beer and shooting as many game birds as possible.
2,"Okay book, if you like hunting","The book does tell stories from the author's own experiences in Baja. I was just surprised that they all revolved around duck hunting. I wanted to read about someone's perspective on the landscape, towns and people. However, I did still get a feel for the author's love of Baja."
3,Beautiful pictures.,"Monastic Gardens has beautiful photographs. I had hoped for more pictures of each monastery with a complete idea of its layout. These photos are meant to evoke a mood and are very successful in doing so. I am still glad I bought the book and have found it useful for bringing life to the rather dry layout drawings of some of the other books available. In fact, I would buy this book for no other reason then to excite other people's interest in monastic gardens who had no previous interest in the subject."
2,Disapointed,"The product looks really nice when viewing it online, but it's alot different in person. I ordered a large for my girlfriend, but it was so small it wouldn't have fit an 80lb 13 year old. Also, when I read hooded jacket, I expected something warm. Instead the material is very thin with no use of keeping anyone warm. I'll admit, it is nice looking, but the extremely small size is what turned me off to this product. If you plan on buying it, don't be ashamed to order something larger than your actual size...you'll need it."
1,I wish I could use it,"This product doesn't work with all Karcher Pressure washers. It only works with Bayonet Style (push and twist) Wand Connections. I had to order a Karcher Pressure Washer Part, Adapter B (4762062)- an additional $19.00."
1,Won't fit my #330 Karcher Power Washer,"I've been trying to contact someone to find out why this product will not fit my power washer. I've put it all together, but it won't fit into the trigger-control handle of the power washer. Help!"
2,Adaptability,I take back all that I said. It does fit the K2-45 and it works extremely well. I just haven't figured out the technique for vertical surfaces. This is a very satisfied customer. I needed to re rate it to a 4.
5,Just right for home use,"We purchased the K12 along with the K520M pressure washer, it saved much time cleaning a filty pool cement deck, we had to rinse off and do detail cleaning with the Quatro nozzle. We are totally satisfied with this attachment, and very pleased with the results."
5,Karcher T350 surface cleaner,"I already owned a Karcher power washer, but needed something to cleaning driveways and sidewalks. I purchased the T350 and used it for the first time yesterday. It worked like a charm, cleaned the areas easily and quickly. Already did my deck with just the power washer, so need to wait until next year to see how the surface cleaner works on that as well. I cleaned about 500sqft of driveway in about 20 minutes. I'm sure just using the powerwasher wand itself would have taken a few hours.."
4,"Consistent, inviting and evocative","This was a pleasant experience. Convincing and evocative performances, great music time after time and overall a DVD with a good message."
4,NOT AN OFFICIAL REVIEW! PS Eno is a recluse!,"For those who do not know much about the elusive ENO, this is a great start. If you have counted every hair on his head since his birth, not for you - sorry. But you know Eno and he has made an effort to stay out of the public for quite a long time. Does that mean you will never get an OFFICIAL Docu? Probably. Yeah, I would love it too. But to trash this just because you are said ""hair counter"", is not fair to those trying to get a hold on a fascinating artist and I for one think they did a fine job."
3,"""Just"" Good - Doc stops right before ""Music for Airports"" - Grrrr","I'm almost exclusively a fan of Eno's ambient music. I was VERY disappointed when this doc stopped right before examining Eno's ""Music for Airports""-era work. Every Eno album prior to it was *exhaustively* covered (read: lots of blathering about), but the documentarian stops before discussing the body of work Eno will most be remembered by??? Pretty poorly done, in my (very biased) opinion. Maybe there will be ""1978-2012"" followup..."
4,Nice clock!,"I've had my clock outside (on a covered patio) for a couple of years now. It's a great size and can be viewed easily from our pool. It keeps perfect time and it's so great how it adjusts itself between daylight savings time and standard time. The only negative for me is the fact that the temperature reading is almost never accurate! I can understand this when the low winter sun is shining directly on it, but when it's overcast and cold it always shows about 10 degrees colder than it actually is. Otherwise I'm very happy with it."
4,Great Outdoor Clock,"I purchased this clock for a screened-in porch and placed it on a wall that is protected from sun and rain. I've had it for two years and it works great! It is very attractive and substantial looking even on a large wall. It sets itself to the correct time automatically and it is large enough to see what time it is while I am out in the back yard at a good distance. The only problem I've had is that it is not especially accurate with humidity readings; even with adjustments, it's usually a ways off. Temperature readings are close to accurate; usually within 3-5 degrees. I bring the clock inside and hang it in my basement in the wintertime, therefore I cannot comment on its cold weather performance. It is usually outside for 6-8 months of the year."
5,A MUST HAVE REFERENCE FOR LOVERS OF FINE PAINTINGS!,"After visiting the Louvre on two occassions we wanted a good reference book to place on our coffee table. This book is the best on the market! The profusely detailed colored photos throughout are nothing less than superior quality. The history of each painting is explained and a lot of information about the artist, their life, and style is also discussed in great detail. This is NOT a small book. It has proven to be invaluable in researching various art works. If you cannot make a trip to Paris to visit the Louvre in person, this book is mandated. Unfortunately, I bought the book at the Louvre and paid SIGNIFICANTLY more! Don't make the same mistake I did. I can honestly say, this book is a family favorite and I have several."
5,Great overview.,"Context: I'm not an academic or a scholar; I'm a regular guy who likes visiting museums when I travel and I wanted to do a little researach before I left. This book worked well for my daughter and I to determine which parts of the museum deserved the most time (on a short trip) and to get a better understanding of the works. I'm not qualified to evaluate it from an academic perspective, but as a layman it was exactly what we needed."
5,A Stunning Inspirational Expression of the Louvre,"I admire deeply the work put together in this book. I believe it was compiled with integrity to the purpose of relaying the center of some of the world's most exquisite art. First of all it is a massive volume in deep, rich color and when you receive it no matter what price you paid it feels well worth it. On several pages you will see a whole painting and then on the next page an enlarged version of the painting's focal point, a section of the art to show the rich detail. Of course you will lose some detail with any representation of this work. But if you can't make it to the Louvre or have been to the Louvre and would like to bring some of the soul stilling art home I highly recommend this book."
3,Overrated,"I'm surprised by the glowing reviews for this book. The reproductions are of poor quality. My advice would be to buy a book published in the last ten years, no more."
5,A Natural,"Peter Cincotti has continued to grow as a performer of tremendous natural talent and great ability. His easy, engaging style makes him a singer and pianist that you will want to enjoy again and again."
4,"""POP JAZZ AT IT'S BEST!!!""","CINCOTTI IS A FINE SINGER/PIANIST/ARRANGER/WRITER OF SONGS/ THE OTHER ARRANGERS ALSO DO A FINE JOB.(STRINGS/BRASS) I GIVE THE CD;*****. **** FOR THE DVD.

1,I put my $73.84 and my time (what I spend for instalation) in trash when I buy Putco Stanlees steel ful fender trim,"I put my $73.84 and my time (what I spend for instalation)in to the trash, when I buy Putco 97128 Stainless Steel Full Fender Trim .It is made from something what used for made can for cat's food, so it is looking so cheap and poor.I do not recomend this thing for nobody.Stay away from.In fact it is not possible to use funccionally."
5,"Clarity, Thoroughness and Excellent Selections","It has been three years since I read this book, but I cannot imagine a better presentation of various philosophical positions. Pojman explains all of the major views with care and unpacks the strengths and objections to various positions. In addition to this, he includes a healthy dose of selections from the actual philosophers that introduced these perspectives.This book chronologically covers logic, schools of thought in ancient Greece and even the rise of Post-Modernism. Pojman gives an excellent presentation of Western Philosophy, but another text will be needed if one wishes to touch upon eastern thought."
4,riveting.... a great read,"Courtenay tells a terrific story here about the Korean War, POWcamps and life as a veteran in Australia. I really did not want toput it down and found myself anxious to get back to it to findout ""what happens next""."
4,Brother Fish,Brilliant story - almost an Australian version of Forrest Gump - Highly recomended excellent read
3,"In this corner, Lysaer....","This book could have been split in two. The first half, all about Lysaer, meandered and was utterly boring. The second half was better in that we finally get to hear about Arithon. I could have skipped the first 300 pages. Personally, in all the series so far, I found the cover art to be better than the story told."
2,Just too bad...,"Well, Ms. Wurts kept me waiting an awfully long time for this book. For well over a year I have been anticipating this book. It is just too bad that it held my intrest for all of 5 minutes. I love the other books, and I still think that she is a fantastic writer; but this latest installation is hardly necessary to the series--except for the one fact that Arithon manages to escape from Lirenda. The next novel will hopefully be much better. If you read the Mistwraith series, buy this book (if only to assure yourself that you wouldn't have missed much). If you have no idea who Arithon or Lirenda are, don't bother. You will find yourself confused and lost and probably with a bad opinion of an otherwise excellent writer."
1,Takes the fun out of reading for fun,The convoluted sentence structure and strange choice of descriptive words sometimes requires reading a sentence two or three times to understand what is being said. I've loved her works in the past but this is too painful to read.
3,Still waiting,"I, too, waitied for this book for a long time. I think that the Mistwraith series (inc this 2nd cycle) has been the been the greatest story in contemporary fantasy, and therefore worth a read. This, however, is the slowest of the series so far, and some of it struck me as filler before [what we have been promised] the final volume.If you enjoy fantasy, you've GOT to read the series so you can't escape this one, but as always I wish I'd waited for the writing to be completed so I could read it all in the one hit.I only wish Ms Wurtz's world in this part of the series had the clarity and detail of the novels of the first cycle. It becomes easy to forget that the whole issue is that this is a world filled to the brim with magic and leashed power. In that, a disappointment because this author has her own magic with words.Now that all of the loose ends have been reexposed for the final novel maybe we can go on?"
3,Overworked.,"I too had desperately waited for this novel. While some important events transpire, I was disappointed at how many pages it takes for so few of them to occur. Some character development occurs, but I had to refer to the glossary several times to remember who all the characters are-- it's been that long! I do not regret buying the book, but only because I own all of the others in the series. I hope that Ms. Wurts gets some good refreshing time before she writes the next book."
3,Not for the Depressed.,"Visually the early performances are a great look back into the era of long/big hair, untrimmed beards, bandanas, tie-dyed t-shirts and the protest folk-rock culture. Many of the performances could have been from Woodstock, except instead of drugged out free-loving hippies we have adults of all ages, many with severely handicapped children and similarly afflicted adults as well. So far it makes sense as these are Benefit concerts. Trouble is, the majority of the music has a definite sad and bitter edge to it as if the musicians are ""depressed"" by their surroundings or are ""protesting"" the afflictions they're there to support rather than a celebration of Life, Support and HOPE. There are exceptions, such as David Bowie and surprisingly Patty Smith, and many others. I don't regret buying it for the option of playing ""selected"" performances from these days-gone-by artists but couldn't watch the entire thing without visions of Doctor Kevorkian."
4,cool it,so cool and so hopefull.25th good gigs.especialy cool David Bowie and bassist lady!!but no Norah Jones on DVD...so sad.
3,Why so few songs?,25 years of Bridge School concerts and here are only 12-13 songs per disk. It's not like the songs are that LONG mind you - but for some reason I feel short-changed.
4,Happy Purchase,"Nice mix of old and new. And frankly the cover art is so attractive, I could resist! I have shared it with my like-minded friends ""of a certain age"", as well as my young adult nieces and nephews and they were duly impressed."
1,Hadley-Roma Men's MSM866LA 180,The worst watchband that I have ever owned. The material is light duty and cheap. The ring of material that secures the excess portion of the band came apart after one month. I thought of fixing the watchband but in the end I decided just to throw it away.
3,"Worth it for the hard to find ""Bad Habits"" by Jenny Burton","I purchased this in lieu of finding Jenny Burton's debut album available on CD. I did give it a few thorough listens to see what else might be interesting, but frankly there isn't much here...at least not to my taste. But I do love Burton's voice and energy on ""Bad Habits"" depite the songs dated production (particularly the faux ""harmonica"" keyboards)."
1,Warning: Incorrect product. Look at the picture!,"This is actually a DB-25 (F) to HD-50 (M) converter, as seen in the picture, and NOT as described in the title.I found this out the hard way, although the merchant I purchased it from was extremely apologetic and cooperative.I am not sure why the listing itself has not been updated to reflect the correct genders."
5,Helpful for Planning a Bike Trip,"We are planning a bike trip to the Natchez area in April and the book has been very helpful in providing general information, helpful hints, and suggestions for various tours along the Natchez Trace that can be tailored to our specific needs and requirements."
3,Very Informative...,"I had to do a report for an english class...i needed 3 sources and i only had 2. I got this book and it provided all the information i needed...religion, clothing, medicine, weapons and many other things unique to the Yaquis. i only give it 3 stars because i hate doing reports :)"
5,Hard to find. . . .,"Right now, Amazon and competitors are only able to get this book through used channels, but it is worth it. This book got me through college and every department wanting a different citation style. It is spiral bound, lays flat and includes the three major styles: MLA, APA and Chicago (aka Turabian). If you need a reference guide for writing papers, this is the best i've seen."
1,"Not sturdy, too short, chain rusts","The hammock stand sections are loosely connected and pull apart when I try to move the stand in my backyard--- It takes two people even to drag the stand to a new position in my lawn. The stand is not long enough for our hammocks, so we have to tie knots in the string section to shorten them up, which reduces their comfort level. Even with this modification to my hammock, I sit about 6"" off the ground because the stand does not hold the hammock high enough off the ground. The chain that connects the hammock to the stand started to rust after a week so we also do not have high hopes for durability. There is no way anyone paid $199 list price for this stand--- I rate it below quality of other stands I've bought. It's barely effective."
5,Well made item - Great price,"I was a little skeptical from reading some of the reviews, but went ahead and bought the stand and hammock combo. Both the stand and the hammock are very well made. This set has no problem supporting 3 people, roughly 200 lbs. More than that I think the hammock will touch the ground. This is an issue with all hammocks, because most are made to stretch. So far I am very happy with the purchase. The price at Amazon is very hard to beat, [$$$] delivered for both stand & hammock."
2,Disappointed,"Delivery was delayed twice, received it a month after it was ordered. It showed up in a ragged cardboard box completely wrapped in packing tape (no exaggeration) as the box would have fallen appart otherwise. Parts of the stand were sticking thru the box. The hooks and chains required to hang the hammock were not in the box, although the description on the box clearly states that they are included. The stand was scratched up and two of the rubber caps to cover the ends of the tubing were punched through as well.Went to Home Depot and picked up some chain and hooks, hung the hammock and works fine. I was bothered enough that I thought about returning it, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble."
4,Damaged stand never delivered,"I ordered the hammack and stand together, great price for both items. I did receive the hammock but FedEx return the stand to the shipper because of damage. Amazon did send a second stand out so now I have both the hammack and stand that I ordered. The only problem is that Amazon now wants to bill me for the original stand I never received. Hopefully, we will get this resolved. However, it is NOT worth the hassle to order this product from Amazon."
5,Simple and Strong,"Essentially this stand is 5 painted pipes. Big, thick painted pipes. You have two bases that have a V-shaped coupling in the middle on top of them. One pipe connects the V couplings of each base, which then causes the other ends of the V couplings to be angled just right to put in the two remaining pipes that extend upwards.The exposed ends of all the pipes are covered with rubber caps that fit tightly so not to fall off. You get two chains that attach to the highest points of the stand, and then to your hammock.Short of planting perfectly placed trees, and waiting 20 years, this stand is a great way to get a nice hammock into your yard. It's assembly and disassembly is so simple that you might even consider taking it to a friend's house for a weekend party."
1,Omni/Swings 'N Things 586 Hammock Stand - Green Finish,"This hammock stand is a piece of junk! I put the stand together and attached the hammock. When I sat in it the bottom support bar broke. Now I am not a small person (6'4"" 250lbs), but the data says it will hold 500 lbs, this dosen't even hold 250lbs. My recommendation is save your money and attach your hammock to two trees."
5,Sturdy and well constructed,"I bought this stand...when they had the stand and Swing N' Things 575 Hammock bundled for [money]. So far its more than worth it. The stand is pretty heavy (about 40 lbs) and very strong. Only thing that would be nice to have on it is the ability for the pieces to interlock so you could lift and move the stand around easier. The connecting tubes are reinforced with thick colors on the ends to keep the openings from expanding and the paint coats all of the outside of the tubing and some of the inside. The end caps on the feet are made of a rubber/plastic type material that doesn't slip and doesn't do a lot of damage to wood decks. Though if you push it around on your deck, the weight of it will leave some light indentations of where you've been pushing it around. We had no problem with 2 adults on it.When i received the package, it was missing the hammock supporting chains, but after calling the manufacturer, they happily shipped me the missing parts via 3-5 day UPS ground"
1,"If you weight more than 240 lbs., do not buy this!!!","I have experienced the exact same thing as the March 31, 2002 post. After placing my double sized hammock on the stand at the highest notche, the support bars bent at where they angle up. And I only used the hammock stand for not even 2 hours. I think 6'2"" (240 lbs.) is under the 500 lbs. maximum. Unless the manufacturer forgot to move the decimal place to the left one position (i.e., 50 lbs. maximum)."
5,Love this SkyScout Case,"This soft-sided case for the Celestron SkyScout works every bit as well as claimed. Perfect fit, no problem operating the buttons, no impact on the functionality/sensitivity of the SkyScout. I would buy this case again."
5,Great Case Protective For SkyScout - Recommended,"While I really enjoy using theCelestron SkyScout Personal Planetarium, we could not let my kids use it because we were concerned about them dropping it since there wasn't a convenient way for them to securely grip the unit. The ""ScoutCase"", resolves that issue by providing a good grip along with the added benefit of very nice protective covering.The case allows for easy access to all of the SkyScout controls, readouts, and ports, with the notable exception of the tripod mount. This is important for me since we occasionally use the SkyScout mounted with theCelestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars w/Tripod Adapterusing a double headed tripod mount. This means that we do have take it out of the case when we want to use it this way. Not much of an issue, but worth noting since the product description fails to mention this design issue.Overall, the ScoutCase is a great and much needed accessory to protect your SkyScout investment. Highly Recommeneded!"
1,Not as good as Skyscout provided case,"I bought this for my wife's new Skyscout I got her for Christmas. To our surprise, this ""quality"" product is a very loose fit, the Skyscout lenses are exposed all the time. With the clear plastic over the operation buttons it is hard to get correct functions of Skyscout. I also makes the led display hard to read in the dark. To us this is a wasted $25. A product I can't recommend to anyone."
2,Skyscout case,"Its a nice case but not really useful. If you have a big hand it would work better, but I gave it to a female friend & the handle on the side does not tighten down enough for her small hand. The Skyscout came with a case to carry it in and you really do not need the extra case."
1,MC HAMMER COULD SHO THIS FOO UP,THIS IS THE WORST RAPPER I HAVE EVER HEARD. THIS GUY MAKES VINILA ICE LOOK LIKE TUPAC. THE ONLY GOOD SONG HES GOT IS SOUL SURVIVOR AND THATS CUZ AKON IS ON THAT. IT WOULD BE A BETTER SONG WIHTOUT JEEZY. IF YOU BUY THIS CD PREPARE TO BE DISAPOINTED.
1,Yawwnnnzz,"Crap.. this guy has a slow flow and it is boring and annoying with his ""yeeaaahhh"" &""riigghhttt"" while hes tryin to be tough,(SMH).. I dont give a flyin f**k if hes ""the truth"" the way people describe him.. he still sucks.. whutz up wit dat song he does with Akon? that song is horrible & g@y.. so whut if he tells a story bout sellin c.o.k.e. and drugs... he still sucks.. if you want to hear something similar but with better flow than this man.. pick up Esham's A-1 Yola (I think Jeezy copied off of him).. or go pick up some Dayton Family.. Young Cheezy is crap"
1,"YO DIS FINNA RAP BE, HE AINT NO SNOW MAN","WHAT HE FINNA BE CALLIN HIMSELF A SNOW MAN NIGGA HE DAKA DEN NIGHT. IF HE AINT GOT NO LIGHT SHINE ON HIM UZ CANT SEE HIM. HES RAP ARE WACKS AND DOES NOTHING BUT SAY YEA!!!!!!!!!!, THATS RIGHT AND IF AINT WASNT FOR DAT BROTHA AKON ON HIS SONG SOUL SURVIVIOR DIS ALBUM WOULD BE COMPLETEY TRASH. SO IF U FINNA BUY DIS FO ONLY DAT SONG UZ BETTA NOT. HES SONG ARE ANNOYING I HAD TO BURN MY CD.PEACE OUT! U FINNA WASTE YO MONEY WIF DIS."
1,zzzzzz,"Thank you to everyone who gave this cd 1 star cause young jeezy is garbage. I think the most on-point 1 star review goes to Mac Ounce so go read what he has to say. I listened to this album once and it was absolutely terrible i try again cause someone told me it was awesome and he was a good rapper, i thought i may of missed something? but i was right the 1st time this cd and this rapper sucks. ""go crazy"" is the only decent song on here but i only listen to the remix cause jay-z's in it....why is jay-z even co signing this loser anyway?? well hes gotta make his money somewhere....hes right up there with YY twinz chingy and lil flip all rappers who suck!!!"
4,Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101,This cd is pretty good. The lyrics are okay on most songs but the beats are hot. Especially on My Hood and Bottom of the Map Its a good debut album from a pretty good rapper. I like this cd better then the boyz n da hood one. My top 5 songs are:1.Soul Survivor ft Akon2.Let's Get It/Sky's The Limit3.Bottom Of The Map4.Trapstar5.My Hood
4,3 stars or higher,"People are saying this guys has no skills, no talent, and comparing him to nelly last i heard nelly is just pop rap and raps about girls and dumbass cars. This guy is one of the only people that have come along in a while actually rapping about the hood and struggle to get money. Overall it's an alright album talks about the club too much, i hate people that do that."
1,it sucks,jeezy is overhyped in the south he gets no love in the north he sucks he can't make a whole verse without a punchline
1,Blowman......Ha ha ha!!!!!,"Who likes this crap? How many lies can you listen to. If this guy was such a gangsta and a big time drug dealer, he is definitely not gonna be on wax talking about it. This clown isn't smart enough to work at White castle. The only snow he can move is off my driveway when I want to pull my lexus out the garage."
2,And then whattt?,"Like the review a few reviews ago said "" i can talk faster then he raps "" lol he's wack! we have enough former slangers turn rappers, and i sure can't stand him saying yeahhhh after every thing he says. The rap game news something new to talk about.Dope boys go crazy is a good song but it sounds like a beat off the black album and its hott because jay-z's on it."
1,I wish i could rate this 0,This nigga suck period.Jeezy need to stop with his annoying a$$ doubles.Do i really not like his music..YEEEEAAAAA!!
2,Is This Album Garbage???? That's Riiiiiight!!!!!!,"First of all, the only reason I'm giving this album 2.5 stars is solely off of beats. The beats is what keeps the public interested in this clown. This fool sets the new upcoming Southern lyricists back to the days of MC Shy D & 2 Live Crew. This cat is a clown. I'm not even on some hater type ish but if he can go platinum just by ad-libbing and album, I know I can go 2x platinum and I don't even rap. Yeah, I bought the album but I regret it now. The Gangsta Grillz mixtape was better than this trash. He repeatedly talks about the same things he did as he did on the mixtape, just over a different beat. I'm glad he did leave BNDH. Big Gee and Jody Breeze can rap circles around this imposter. If it wasn't for his BMF crew, he probably wouldn't even be in the game. So to shorten this review, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,An absolute joke,"Checked this album out, what a waste. The rap game needs a breathe of fresh air, not more gangsta trash. Young Jeezy is wack and so is that Boyz N Da Hood pile."
1,young jeezy is a wanksta,"I don't understand the hype about jeezy everybody knows he sold drugs blah, blah, blah, gangster rap used to be entertaining but clowns like jeezy give rap a bad name listen to mc eiht, spice 1, wc, mack 10, yukmouth, and south central cartel instead."
5,The revival of southern gangsta rap,"This is one of the best rap albums I've heard all year. It's got great production, great rapping, and great writing by Young Jeezy. There is not a bad song on here and he doesn't go commercial. It's about time for a break of fresh air. The south is infamous for having a lot of bad rappers but Young Jeezy is one of the best in the south. This is the revival of southern gangsta rap and one of the year's best albums. Go cop this along with the Boyz N Da Hood album."
1,"Let's Get it: Thug Motivation 101, should not get it.","Let's Get it: Thug Motivation *1/2 StarsDespite some good production and one good song featuring Akon, this pretentious and idiotic album will surely have you annoyed, Young Jeezy's performance is terrible, the lyrics don't work and the lyrical content is annoying especially The Song and then what.This is a pointless and awful album that will surely be on my list of the year's worst album."
4,good for a rookie,"this guy can rap. i cant say i like his voice cuz i dont. but other than that the album is hot. the tracks are hot some of them . this guy managed to pull 4 singles off this album a rookie and 4 singles must be good. check out go crazy and then what, soul survivor, thug motivation, air forces, and some others. oick uop this one if u like gangster rap . later AYE"
5,Suprise CD of the summer...,"I'm not exactly sure how I ended up buying this cd, considering the Boyz N Da Hood Cd was mediocre at best. But this CD was really the suprise CD of the summer to me. All the beats are phat, and although he doesn't have the best flow, he keeps you interested throughout the whole CD. This is all I've been listening to lately and I'm not sick of it at all. Best Tracks: Soul Survivor ft. AkonBang ft. TI/ScrappyTrap or DieGo CrazyIf you haven't heard it, buy it."
1,YOUNG CHEESSY!,"It's the only name I can give to some one with such a weak flow let alone name. along with the rest of these so called thug rappers, he's going to fade into oblivion within a year.This guy seriously need to go to school and learn how to talk so therefore he can actually rap. As for now, this clown ain't rappin, he crappin out like a pair of dice.Instead of giving listeners Thug Motivation, someone ought to motivate this fool to read a Hooked on Phonics book."
1,THIS SUCKS!,GO CRAZY IS OK AND HOOD IS TOLERABLE BUT THE REST OF THIS IS THE SAME OLD JUNK! THERE ARE BETTER OTHER SONGS OUTT THERE THAN THIS JUNK
2,This is weak,"""Go Crazy"" is hot. The rest of the album sucks. Young Jeezy really can't rap and relies on his ad libs to take up space when he runs out of words to say. His topics also revolve around selling powder. I know it's been said a million times but look towards OutKast, Scarface, B.G. or even Lil Wayne if you want some southern rappers with substance in their rhymes."
2,Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 - Young Jeezy,"Man this album is garbage! I bought it after listening to ""Soul Survivor"" and thought that there migth be more songs like that but man, what a huge dissappointment!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY IT! I'm telling u right now if u expect more songs like ""Trap Or Die"" or ""Soul Survivor"" u r in for a surprise!"
2,Explain!!,"OK.... I haven't heard every song he owns, but TELL my why do people like him, HUH?!! I mean do y'all like his lyrics? His vioce and his ""yeeeeeeeeeaaaahhh"" ""alriiiiiiiiiiiiiighhhhhtt""? lol, is do y'all just buy the album because of the beats? Look I haven't heard everything but to me this guy is wack, please, someone please tell me I'm mistaken........ The reason I give 2 stars because I have some respect"
1,WHAT DA!!!,"OH MAYN...DIS LIKE SOO COOL...........IT DEFINES HIP HOP TO THE FULLEST. DIS GUY IS INSPIRING AND CUTE. AND HE HAS INTELLIGENT LYRICS.....AND AND AND HE IS LIKE (...)CUZ HE HUSTLE AND HIS IN DA GAME YO....KEEP IT REAL...HIS NURSERY RYHME IS BANGIN....ALRIGHT IM OUT , IMMA GO PIMP SOME HOES..PEACE OUT MAN..."
1,young slow,"if he raps any slower his rap is going to go into reverse,young jeezy cant rap who would wanna buy this album waste of money"
1,be real guys,"this guy sucks. simple and plain. his voice is annoying, his flow is whack and he has the lyrical depth of a 2 year old. the only good songs on the cd are soul survivor w/ akon b.c akon is tight work and bang b.c it has t.i. and lil scrappy two sick ass individuals. but i wont lie he has good production. but him as a rapper, two thumbs down. give this clown zero stars. if u wanna see what im talking about lyrically listen 2 a verse from the song ""and then what"" produced by mannie fresh (tight beat tho)."
3,"Alright, but I would perfer his underground titles instead.","Not all that good if you ask me. I was suprised this album because after all his good work on his underground albumssuch as ""Come And Shop Wit Me"", I thought that this would hit itoff but is worth buying."
1,And Now Wut?,"Young Jeezy Ha...........I give it zero stars.I dont understand boom boom crap. is it english? i mean it aint a baseball game. young jeezy you gon lose ya fame, you lame, listen amerie is neva gon be yours, so chill kid. bald, husky, always wearin glasses, i mean we all know what you got beady eyes so dont wear them. so whats up with that snow man? what you do, keep him in the freezer in the summer? well its about to turn winter so atlease that wont be a bummer. p***y. whats up wit Boyz N Da Hood, where yall second single at? well i guess Diddy couldnt find any more bass beats. yo manny fresh, u not fresh, u stink now, wit dat boom boom crap, wuz up wit dat? yo dat bakin soda u kno u dont use dat fo crack nigg, so chill wit dat. yo n i heard dat one song ""standin ovation"" or whateva, for free and i had turn it off afta dat. wuz up wit da fake clappin n dat song? u dont git no standin ovations, nigg stop frontin like u got it like dat. cuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz u dont."
2,"DAMN, that was weak","This aint representin ATL or Southern Rap. Southern Hip Hop is based on roots music like Blues, Funk and Soul and even when it strays away from that it still gives you something to listen to. This album lacked ALL of that. This was a bunch of unorganized poorly thought out production given to a rapper that isnt that great to begin with. I'll give Jeezy props, dude is original but this album sucked. If the beats was good I would've given him like a 3.5 but the beats were mediocre and the lyrics werent good. Jeezy as a rapper has a poor delivery, flow and lyrics aint to great but his style IS original. Give Jeezy a producer that blends in with Jeezy's style and dude will be something nice, until then Im sleepin on him."
2,A Good Listener,"Hands down one of the best debut's this summer, my little brother kept telling me about this cat named Jeezy and I slept on it, but now I see what I was missing !!!!"
3,Decent...,"This album is decent, not bad, but not great either. Their is quite a few good songs, but their are too many below average songs that puts album's rating down. But if you have some extra cash and happen to be at a store where they sell CD's, this won't be a bad purchase.Top SongsSoul SurvivorLast Of A Dying BreedAir Forces"
1,over priced frisbee,"This is not worth the 15 cent raw material cost that the CD was created with. The rhymes & beats are the worst I've heard in a long time. I also hate fake thug images... It's not that you have to be gangsta or thug to be good; it's just that you should be whatever you really are and not put on a studio act. terrible.. The only reason I even owned this is becuase some music club sent it to me automatically.. It really amazes me the crap that some artists try to pass of as ""hip hop"" and the dumb people who don't know what good rap sounds like.."
4,Great player at reasonable rates,"I have a Toshiba DVD player in my living room and was looking for one for my bedroom. I found...this modelI figured how couild I go wrong. I picked it up, and it plays DVD's as good as my Toshiba. It also plays all of my MP3' files so it has an advantage over my other system.I liked it so much I bought one for my summer place in NY state.My only complaint would be the remote. They could make it easier to use."
2,"Two players skip ""bad"" sections of new DVDs","I bought this DVD player as a cheap second system. The first DVD I tried played perfectly, but the second kept skipping sections with the message that it was skipping over bad spots. Since the DVD was new, had no scratches and played perfectly on other players I assumed the player was defective and traded it for an identical player. The new player worked with that DVD, but with the very next DVD the problems were back. I'm returning the second Koss player today and looking for another brand."
2,KOSS,"DON'T BUY IT! I bought a KOSS DVD player and it broke in 6 months. I was told I was out of luck because the warranty is only 90 days. They do not do repairs. My only option is to buy a new one and wasn't even offered a discounted price for it. I have seen several complaints like mine about KOSS on the web. They make JUNK and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks. Oh, by the way I loved it until it broke."
2,Sad,"I was so excited when I first got this and it worked fine for awhile. I'd have to turn it off and on by unplugging it to get the discs out. And it would often tell me that it couldn't read my discs (and these were store bought, high-end name brand movies). Finally I had to return it. Oh, and the instruction book was awful! Very poorly written and didn't make any sense. Do.Not.Buy.It."
4,works fine,"...Anyway, works fine. Sharp silver look. Plays mp3 disks.. meaning you can load hours of music into it from a single burned CD. However, does not appear to play VCD's..."
3,Koss KD260 DVD,"i got this yesterday for CDN 100.00 and so far it works great. I can also EXCHANGE it (within a year)...WE all know that these are sort of refrubished models.....So far so good.....Happy THX Giving Rgds, Ak"
3,Not up to author's usual high standard,"The author is at her best when she recounts the adventures, both mundane and spiritual, that she encountered during her amazing life and travels. When she expounds on spiritual teachings and doctrines, she is not so skillful.Given the brevity of the book, one can hardly expect a complete and systematic exposition of the views on the topic of immortality and reincarnation found in China, Tibet and India. Still, the work is so idiosyncratic and choppy that it will be of limited value for anyone seeking an introduction and overview of the teachings and insights offered by these diverse cultures. That is unfortunate, such a work is much needed.Yet, with these limitation in mind, this work does offer some value for the discerning reader."
5,Very interesting book!,Thought provoking inside look at a fascinating religion. It is refreshing to see that there are so many different outlooks on the life we are living. Not to mention the snip-bits offered about Christianity. I really enjoyed it.
4,Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond,"Judy Beck's Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond is an excellent text for graduate students and clinicians beginning to learn Aaron T. Beck's system of cognitive therapy. It is highly readable and includes lots of examples of dialogue between therapist and client. J. Beck also addresses common problems that arise in cognitive therapy, such as failure to do homework and suicidality. In addition, Dr. Beck includes a number of valuable forms to use in cognitive therapy. I've been using this book for practicum students for several years now and am very pleased with the results."
4,Good resource book for Cognitive Therapy,"Great book. Among the other benefits it provides, it can help the practitioner develop case plans. For example, the therapist can use the flow charts provided to help decide what the client's underlying issue is. Provides information and examples about how to best navigate the client's situation. Very pragmatic book with a lot of good examples and ideas. Worth keeping in your library.PS I am a beginnning therapist, so maybe a more seasoned therapist would not find it as helpful. (?) I sure like it, though!"
4,The Nuts and Bults,This book teaches the nuts and bolts of Cognitive Therapy. I first read this book as part of a graduate course on cognitive-behavioral therapy and have been using it as a reference book and an occasional refresher ever since. The book covers the most important structural and content components of cognitive therapy. It is didactic in format and interspersed with client/therapist dialogue illustrating various techniques and problem situations as well as the phases of therapy. This book is proof that Judith Beck is both a talented teacher and practitioner of cognitive therapy.
2,Harder book to put into practice,"This book is much harder to use for therapy than her father's. This is more about how to be a cognitive therapist, and is of a textbook style, with only one example case followed through the book. If you want to learn how to be a cognitive therapist this is a good book for that. If you are seeking an overview of how cognitive therapy works and learning specific tools the cognitive therapy for mood disorders is a much better read."
5,"Lush sounds, not of this earth! Brilliant!","This is a truly wonderful experience of cinematic and well produced New Age music! All the pieces on this CD floats together in such a beautiful way that I can't find the words in how good it really is.There is only one other Robert Fox album album that can match with this one and that's 'Touching The Serpents Tail'. But this is a more solid effort according to me, and an even more well polished album with lots of orchestral beats with grand piano's that suits all the tracks very well!A masterpiece like this could easily be in an IMAX film at the planetariums around the world. It would suit perfectly in one of those nature IMAX films, or at the home theatre.For me this is pure bliss for your mind & soul from start to finish. Great rhythms and lush sounds not of this earth is what you will find here. Excellent work, Robert!. I love this album so much! It's a must buy!Highly Recommended!!"
5,Very emotionally connected,"This is one of my new favorites, right up there with Bonnie Rait, Sarah McLachlan, and Shawn Colvin. The words and music are very emotionally connected and soulful. I especially like ""eulogy,"" ""haunted melody,"" and ""if wanting is like having."" You got to check this out!"
4,"ambient, candlelit-folk romance for the new millenium","'Eureka' is veritable plethora of delights. Great sounds, writing, lyrics. Besides the fact of being a well rounded musician, Brad produces and engineers his and others recordings. The recordings sound as if they were done in a world-class studio when in actuality they were done at Brad's home."
5,A Gripping Tale of a Sea Voyage,"When reading this book, the reader is entranced with the adventurer that is Tristan Jones. He describes his journey in a manner which entertains, educates and captivates. For a boat lover, this book is a must read. For the adventure fan, this book provides hours of entertainment and excitement. Certainly, Tristan Jones finest hour."
2,I've read better,I had a rather difficult time reading this one. Not much writting about being at sea. Leaves port one paragragh arrives another. I liked his other books much better.
3,Max & Monty dump lose their dumper rather quickly,"My twin boys love the trucks, but within minutes the dump parts of the trucks were displaced and lost. I can understand why they were made easily detachable, but the fact remains that the two parts of the truck are rarely found together, and toddlers are usually unable to find the parts or put them together again.Get ready to spend a lot of time with these trucks if you buy them. Every few minutes your kid will want you to repair them."
4,Just like the ones in the show,These look just like the Max & Monty in Thomas & Friends and are durable and have withstood my kids use very well.
4,Late 40's Basie,"These recordings are part of Basies sides he recorded in the late 40's. Critics tend to pass over this period in Basies career, but the band is still tight and nobody sings the blues like Jimmy Rushing. there's some boogie, some small band pieces, and some R&B style big band pieces. A good, although short, sample of how the bnad sounded during the period when be-bop was ascending, and swing bands were struggling."
2,Don't waste your time...,"No matter who is in the cast, it would be hard to outshine the Peter O'Toole/Katherine Hepburn ""Lion in Winter"" -- even if Hepburn is Hepburn as always.This new version comes nowhere near. Visually it's somewhat better -- the detail on costumes, props, and sets is fascinating. But poor Patrick Stewart, poor Glenn Close (who I normally adore!), poor cast -- abysmal. The three princes are awful, and Jonathan Rys-Myers -- well, he should have passed on this one. He's very talented, but it doesn't show here.I have to confess I didn't even finish watching it. It just doesn't work. This is another remake that should never have been remade!"
1,Atrocious remake of the best film ever,"I try to evaluate a movie like this on two sets of criteria: 1. Is it a good adaptation? and 2. Is it a good movie, in and of itself?The answer to both questions, in this case, is no. The original movie's dialogue was delivered with such impecible timing and sarcastic, sharp wit that you could actually believe these folks WERE Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The onscreen chemistry between Peter O'Toole and Catharine Hepburn was off the charts, and the supporting cast, including a very young Anthony Hopkins, was superb.In this remake, Patrick Stewart (who I always regarded as a great actor) and Glen Close (who I never did) seem to have about as much interest in their dialogue as a toddler in a calculus class. They sound so scripted and deadpan that it's hard to believe they weren't actually reading off of cue cards (perhaps they were). They barely, as far as I could tell, even make eye contact with one another.Disappointing all around."
4,Lion in Winter,"Good movie, same lines as the original with Peter O'tool, supporting cast was rather weak. Richard was badly cast, as was the young King of France. The poor armor was really fake looking. But overall, the lead characters of Henry and Eleanor made the movie worth watching."
1,LOGIC EVAPORATES,"There are times in the world of movies when it seems that all logic evaporates. A remake of THE LION IN WINTER, the 1968 masterpiece starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, is such time. Nothing in this movie comes remotely close to the original. In taking the role as Henry II, Patrick Stewart continues a line of miscasting messes that have included his trying and failing to best Gregory Peck's Ahab in a remake of MOBY DICK, and trying and failing to make a credible Ebenezer Scrooge while falling well short of George C. Scott's masterful portrayal in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.Glen Close is just awful! When compared to Katherine Hepburn, Close is like having a tuna sandwich when lobster is on the menu!The rest of the cast is equally abysmal. How do you replace Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton, John Castle and Jane Merrow? You don't as evidenced by this film. How can you think that you can? That remains the mystery!THE HORSEMAN"
2,Fell asleep while watching,"I was excited to receive this DVD as the main characters were portrayed by two of my favorite award-winning actors: Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart. They delivered strong performances which lived up to their billing, unfortunately, the supporting cast, the directing, the set and costumes were less impressive. At the end of the experience, I fell asleeep while watching the DVD and regretted making the purchase."
3,But Why?,"To be sure, the reasoning behind many of today's films defies understanding. This one is no exception.Although the main stars all give adequate performances, and the screenplay is exactly the same as the original, the question remains. Why remake one of the finest films of all time? Who could have possibly thought there was room for improvement? Why not remake Casablanca or Citizen Kane while we're at it?Again, I fault not the actors in this treatment, for they all did fine jobs - if pale by comparison to the originals. My problems with this film stem with the powers that be who decided to produce it in the first place."
5,Rubber Soul of the Nineties,"This album is simply breathtaking: soulful and heartfelt renditions of original and other songmaterial combined with superb singing and playing performance as well as brilliant production. Even Jagger/Richards' ""Back Street Girl"" comes to new life, the adding of a dobro works beautiful here. Each song is a jewel in its own right, the whole album being more than the sum of its parts. Call it a song cycle, if you will, I'd call it the ""Rubber Soul of the Nineties"". Too bad that group has been so short lived."
5,Dying slowly while standing on your own two feet.,"I've had this book for years and forgot to read it until now. It was a very quick read and I really enjoyed it, because it was a break away from the urban street lit that I was becoming used to. Set in the 1940's, this novel focused on Helen, the head strong mother, Adele, the oldest and free-spirited daughter and Lita, the one who saw the world more clearly for what it was and wasn't, but was afraid to speak her mind, because the other two women in her life wasn't trying to hear it. Throw in smooth-talking Lucien and you've got a tale filled with secrets, lies & murder that comes bubbling up to the surface. I've never been the type for flashback sequences, but the ones provided gave way to the origins of how these women became who they were and why it was so hard for them to break from living their lives away from the regular and mundane. A very good read."
5,Dead Above Ground,"I came into this, never before reading a Jervey Tervalon novel, and I must say hats off to the author, because this story is pure genius.Tervalon paints pictures with his words as we travel in time to the 1940's, in the searing and humid city of New Orleans, Louisiana. We meet the Du Champ girls, Lita, and Adele who make up 2 parts of a family filled with deep secrets and much drama.For the spirited and young Lita Du Champ, New Orleans is a place subjugated by her diligent mother, Helen who basically holds the family up. Devoted to her mother -- and sisters - she works very hard to keep the family together while making an effort to institute a life of her own.When her beautiful, restive and MARRIED sister Adele falls in love with their mother's enemy, Lucien Faure -- a smooth operator with ""the devil's good looks"", Lita divulges her mother's mystifying past... With this new information, Lita finds that she has one last, frantic chance to save the destiny of the ones she loves."
2,Ball of Confusion,"How does a young woman keep her family together when secrets threaten to blow it apart? This is the dilemma of Lita Duchamp. Lita's family life wasn't exactly the American dream. Her father was a drunken loser who thought much too highly of himself. Her mother Helen was the breadwinner, a woman who knew how to earn, and ran the family business. Her sister Adele was a glamour girl with hot pants married to a sailor who thought the world of her. Then there were the young twins a last ditch effort by Helen to brighten her already dim marriage. This ""idyllic"" life was threatened by one Lucien Faure' who has one the heart of Adele and has a score to settle with Helen.Tervalon weaves a great story into a confusing ball of a book without the benefit of division by chapters. The reader knows that Lita is charged with keeping the family together, yet it seems that Helen is the actual heroine in this story. This reader isn't so sure that this was Tervalon's intention."
5,An act of courage,"To release a DVD containig a portuguese movie in the american market is, in fact, an act of courage. Manoel de Oliveira is, probably, the best potuguese filmmaker of all time and this movie is a fabulous example of what he can do. It's a personal voyage to the depths of the memory of a man and to the family past of another. Slow paced, very well directed and with a great script, ""Voyage to the beggining of the world"" is a typical portuguese movie, filled with a sense of nostalgy that defines the portuguese people. Indeed a great movie by a great director, the oldest in the world."
2,It's a hard DVD to review,"Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira was 89 years old with a resume that would let him make any damn film he wanted. So what did he do? He went autobiographical. A fine cast of four, headlined by Marcello Mastroianni, drive from France to Portugal in search of one man's past. Introspective and subdued in both style and scenery.It can be difficult to read subtitles in a dialogue-heavy film. But once we reach Portugal, most lines are between a French speaker and a Portuguese speaker, with a translator, and the luxury (for me) of seeing the same thing in English subtitles twice. Even so, with an awareness that these films are a bit expensive in the US, I can't really recommend it.So what is it about? Beginnings and endings. What we remember, what we forget. Family relationships gone bad. Atonement. Unflinching realism. In that, it is brilliant. But hell, it might bore somebody, I don't know. So I respect it but I don't recommend it. Does that make any sense?"
2,Get over yourself!,"This author really thinks that older mothers are better than younger ones, and doesn't let you forget it for a single page! I'm just turning 35 and don't quite feel all the wisdom I'm supposed to have according to this book."
5,Great book for beginner carvers,I purchased this book for some basic information to get started wood carving. It is very informative and a good start if you have never done it before.
2,hitch mount,"The service was very good, No delays in shipping. I found the quality of construction of a very simple device very poor the receiver tube was out of alignment with the mounting plate,the welding was of marginal quality as well as the dimensions were not accurate and fit on square tubing was extremely tight. My first disappointment in dealing with Amazon.ld"
5,Sugar Glider is snug,I swear my sugar glider smiled when this was attached to her cage. She loves it! Very soft and and well sewn. Reasonably priced and shipped fast.
1,"piece of trash, literally","I opened the box to find a very flimsy lightweight tent that I knew wouldn't last a day. I was wrong. It didn't last 10 minutes. The first time my male rat stepped into it, a strap broke and scared him to death. Luckily he was ok and didn't break his neck as he fell. I didn't chance letting them use it again, as it was so flimsy anyway that the bottom was sure to rip apart as well someday.Trash man took it away that night and it is now resting peacefully in the dump."
2,Can't get it clean,"My rats loved this tent. One of them however, is a marinator...he likes to just pee where he is and then sleep in it. I had hoped I could wash it but the thing doesn't turn inside out. I washed it anyway, twice, but couldn't get it clean so I had to toss it. I will be sticking with hammocks instead."
3,eh,"i like the way it looks but when i got it, it was blue, not purple. i got mine about a week ago and one of the hanging straps ripped off already. i had to fix it with a safety pin. plus it gets lobsided when things sleep in it unlike the cube which is a MUCH better item than the tent. the ferrets still like to sleep in it sometimes though so ill still give it a few stars. its just cheaply made"
4,Rattie Nest!,"The rats have chewed the floor out of this thing, but they've also stuffed it with fleece and redecorated. They love sleeping, napping, and grooming in there!"
3,I know colors vary but wish,I know colors vary but wish they didn't... because my guinea pigs (2) are girls and we so happen to get the ugly blue... other then that they took to it very quickly and seem to enjoy it they both fit in this thing they weigh about 400 and 500gms right now .. I have it on the floor with the hooks on the their cage and its a cozy little spot for them but I think I will look for something a little warmer and a girly color because they are princesses lol =]
3,Author's Note--It Ain't a Book!,"""The Argonauts"" is a chapter title in a book I wrote and published in 1982, titled ""California's Finest: The History of Del Monte Corporation and the Del Monte Label"". Del Monte Foods owns the copyright.The latter is still in print, incidentally. But the former is just a chapter heading."
5,A great work,"I am not a historian, hence my review may be rather subjective. While this book would in general only be of interest to people involved in research of Japanese history, I read it for a class assignement and found it very enjoyable.Understanding of this book requires some basic knowlege of Japanese history. Given that, the book is very easy to read. Ruppert does a great job covering a multitude of aspects of Japanese society in which relic veneration had a role, while not ""dragging out"" discussion of any particular topic.I would definitelly recommend this book to anyone who in has an interest in the role of buddhism in medieval Japan."
4,The Maid of Orlean,"I've read the history and the film does take some liberty with it but it has enough of the facts. The film has a really cool look to it. Jose Ferrer probably does the best job, true to the real character and even looks correct."
1,Never Again,"I ordered this item in time for delivery before Christmas but it took Office Depot SIX WEEKS to ship it to me. When the item arrived, it did not work. Pressing the power button did absolutely nothing; the unit simply would not turn on. Now I have to go through the enormous hassle of shipping the freakin' thing back to them. I will not be ordering from this seller again."
4,"Handy, but time will tell.","I don't usually buy ""combo"" electronics because you never know when one component will fail, rendering the other part useless. In this case, however, I wanted an inexpensive way of watching DVDs that was relatively portable. This unit appears to fill the bill. Its portability could be improved, but it's lightweight and easy to stash in the cupboard and pull out when I want to view a movie at the kitchen table or on the porch. And it has a front audio output for a headset, which was another requirement of mine."
1,OH! so bad :::worst than the first one,"I don't know why Marc Levy has such a success, am French & I've already read three of his books and I think he is a cheater...Maybe you are not familiar with French writer René Barjavel but he must be the one Levy COPY! When I read If only it were true I couldn't help wondering : ""Where have I seen it before?"" the answer is in Barjavel's book ""La Nuit Des Temps""= ""The Ice People""... This second book is to mu opinion again a rewriting of Barjavel's Le Grand Secret"" so if I were you future buyers I would look for another writer, someone better someone no cheater!!!> Nelly French COOL HARD-BOILED EYE!!!"
3,Eh,"Once again, Aceyalone has put out another album as hastily as he possibly can. Accepted Eclectic was released less than a month ago, and Declaration of an Independent was realeased along with Haiku D'etat not long before these. Aceyalone, with tremendous talent, has put out great records before, and even when he flings out album after album as fast as he can, they are still decent. But it is not hard to hear the lack of time put into this album. Aceyalone should start applying his talent better, like he used to."
2,Doesn't send a good message,"While this blowup starfish book is entertaining in the bathtub for my 9 month old, I was extremely disappointed with the message of the story. Stella, the starfish, admires her friend Freddy, the fish, saying ""I wish I were a fish. Then I could swim fast like you. She says of her friend Ophelia, the octopus, ""I wish I were an octopus. Then I could carry things like you."" She says of her friend Charlie, the crab,""I wish I were a crab. Then I could walk sideways like you."" In the end all of her friends wished they were as ""pretty"" as Stella because ""You're a Star."" The message of wishing that you are something else, better, prettier, etc. bombards our children everyday. How sad that it is now starting with books intended for babies and pre-schoolers. When my daughter can understand the words in this book and their meaning, it will no longer be in our home."
4,The book is excellent but,"The book gives you a lot of information but: 1) the index is poor especially there's no index for the variables used, so sometimes you need to guess what a letter has been used for or go back few pages to find out what that letter was for(if you find any), 2) I haven't checked all the formulas but the one I needed was (I can say) wrong. If the authors take another look at the book, and add an index for the huge amount of variables used, I think it will change to one of the best resources for Induction Motor Design Engineers."
4,advanced design book,"This book is probably worth the money. It is quite advanced. It seems to contain considerable theory. Some of the notation is hard to follow, but I didn't study it too hard. This is a book that would unfold over time. Someone who is learning can't just read a chapter and bingo. This book is for the long term. I hope to understand this book more after a few more years in motor design."
5,Why Doesn't Amazon Stock This Book?,I've personally given away over 50 copies to friends and strangers. No one ever had anything but grateful thanks.
5,Redwall Rocks,"I have read all the Redwall books 3 times, & I am looking forward to reading this one! It looks awesome!"
3,It's okay. not the best.,"I thought this book was good. It was interesting to read, but nothing els i'm afraid. I think the bad guys in the book was never really developed. (like cluny) They're always killed by another big enemy before their characteristic were developed and they ALL seemed the same thick headed cowardly enemy only with different forms. I think they also die too quickly.The story also seemed..... recycled. the first part about enemies attacking Redwall (AGAIN) and the second part when the badger looks for the vermin. His story is almost like Sunmace (think that was his name.)Other then that it was good. Not Brian's best work, but good. But i think he should introduce some new animals, maybe a live wolf etc."
5,Still amazing after all these years!,"It didn't even take me a whole day to read this, the sixteenth book in the Redwall series. BJ has managed to create a world that is entirely his own, yet he stil manages to keep the series alive and fresh with exciting new charectors and events."
2,Worst Redwall Yet.... If There Is Such A Thing,"This book is by far the worst Redwall book ever written. Unlike Mattimeo or The Pearls of Lutra, it lacked action or excitement. It seems that as Jacques writes more books, the worse they get. Triss, book 15, also was awful. I personally think Jacques should stop the series, even though they are excellent books. Loamhedge was boring, and so was Triss, so I hope he does not put out another book. I am sure lots of die hard fans think the same."
2,Loamhedge,"Out of all the Redwall books I've read, this was probably the less entertaining.Its fun to see the little characters have a life and fall in love.I felt the characters had no important role in the book.Most importantly, his books have been A LOT better. This was a dissapointment to me, it doesn't compare with Redwall and The Long Patrol. The battle wasn't really fast and furious. I didn't get the feel i was there. He usualy takes such interest in the charactersd and scenery. One word, DISSAPOINTMENT! Sorry Brian."
4,Why does no one think this is good?,"I read the other reviews on the page this book, and they all say it sttinks. I thought it was really good! It has battles! It has monsters! It has possibly the scariest villan of all the books (Wearet)! Its still good!"
2,The Redwall series is deteriorating. (contains spoilers),"I have loved the Redwall books for a long time. But now, after reading the sixteenth book of the series, the books are getting worse. The villains are no longer vile and ruthless. Martha Braebuck is a goody-goody. The quest to Loamhedge is pointless and gets my favorite characters killed. Lonna is just like all the other badgers in the whole blasted series, except he has a girly name. As for the feasting and songs, same old, same old. It was a decent book in itself, but compared to the rest of the series, not so."
5,Manufacturer's Original part,"Perfectly identical to the other one I have on the BCD. Great quality. Hopefully, this one will not make a run for it to the bottom of the ocean. Make sure to velcro it well if you are using a serious amount of lead in the pocket. Happy diving."
4,Black Belt Magazine: Tonfa - Karate Weapon of Self Defense,"I think that this book is both well written, and instructive in it's information. I find it to be a good instructional reference."
2,Works great until it breaks....,"We have three large dogs and the Innotek SD-2000 fence system. The system overall works great, the only downfall is the collars break. We've had four collars fail in 16 months. Something breaks inside of them, they start rattling, and they're gone. Innotek didn't even take the time to pot the electronics in this collars, they're put together so cheaply it's like Innotek didn't care if they broke. Maybe OK if you have small dogs, but if you have big dogs that play hard - you'll be replacing these on a regular basis............."
2,System works until collor breaks,this system has worked great for my boston terrior. Unfortunally I have had to replace two colars at $70.00 a pop within the last two years and need a new one again. Bottom line is the colars break easy and you will have to invest money to keep your system working.
3,Wish they lasted longer!,"This collar works just as advertised and I am very happy (and my dog is too) that my dog is able to roam freely in our yard. I have 2 issues with this collar:1. It seems to break a lot.... I think I've had 4 or 5 of them in the last 5 years.2. It seems to be overpriced for what it is. It is a piece of plastic with a couple of metal posts, a small circuit board I'm sure, a battery and the actual collar that goes around the dog's neck... I really don't think it would cost the company more than $15 when you think about other electronics and products out there. I would be more than willing to pay the $55 for the collar if it lasted longer... it just puts a sour taste in my mouth when it seems to break so often.Bottom line.... It works."
2,dont last long,"think im on my 5th collor in about 5 years. they just stop working,,, dont know why,,, not getting them wet or abusing them in any way.wish i went with different system,, its $$$ getting new collor each year."
3,Durability issues,Have had the Innotek invisible fence for several years and it has been great. The only problem has been the control on the collar seems to break after 12-18 months. It suddenly develops a rattle as if something has come loose inside and stops working. The dog that wears it is not overly active or rough when wearing it.
3,keeps breaking,"I have to buy new collar about every 6 months. they keep breaking inside. it's not the battery, maybe from the dogs wrestling with each other"
3,Innotek dog collar and ground system,"Works great but made cheaply so doesn't last. I went through three the first 2 years, but Innotek replaced them 3 times and only charged the shipping cost. The last one lasted 5 years, which I think is acceptable. If we hold them accountable, maybe they will make them sturdier in the future"
3,Innotek Dog Collar,"This is an excellent product, and works well. It will keep your dog in your yard and make your worries go away, about your dog being hit, or chasing people."
4,Replacement collar/receiver,"I bought this collar to replace the one from my old and discontinued Innotek HF-201 fence. Innotek no longer supports the HF-201, but the customer service person at Innotek said this collar might work. The other option was that they would give me $25 off a new system, so I ordered this collar. It works with the old fence. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it is not rechargeable."
3,"Good as a fence, but goes off randomly while inside","This is the second replacement we've gotten and it seems all of them just go off randomly. Not good when you are trying to train the dogs, but at least it only seems to happen when we're inside. So just make sure that you remove the collars when you let the dogs into the house because they will get zapped for no reason."
3,"When it works, it works great. But when it doesn't.....","I got this nozzle at the same time I bought my pressure-washer (about 15 months ago). At first it changed settings just fine, but the more I use it, the harder it becomes to get a pattern to ""lock in"". My favorite pattern for cleaning is the rotating circle, but sometimes I want to use the pinpoint. I dread having to change the pattern! I have to twist it back and forth several times to get it to lock into a spray pattern, instead of just dribbling water. Not sure if there's a problem with my unit or if this is a design issue, but my warranty has run out and I won't buy another one of these. I bought the surface cleaner, and I love it."
3,Entertaining but a bit light.,"It is clear from this DVD that everything that came out of Feynman's mouth was not such a pearl of wisdom. While he didn't exactly say anything wrong, he did not offer a lot of new insight into the concept of nanotechnology. It was clear that, while he knew, in general, about MEMS technology and silicon device fabrication, he did not offer anything but an introduction to an audience that knew little or nothing about physics.The discussion degenerated into a Q and A that had little to do with science and a lot to do with science fiction. Feynman, to his credit, was good natured as he waded through the questions one by one.It was fun to watch and nice to see Feynman playing the bongos one more time."
1,A Mystic (scientist?),"I have always wanted an interesting teacher that electrifies the science area. I despised the traditional old books that said nothing about the subject and added only dryness, just dryness. So, I looked at Feynman as a good excuse and tried it, why not? It's a very, very primitive basic review on the subject. Feynman segways more than he teaches, he drums more than he teaches. Saying very little of substance. More like a casual hang-out that has coffee and friends and drumming, sadly, I'm not a fan of any of that. I am now convinced that math and science should remain dry and to the point which is enough to give this terrible DVD 1 star out of 5."
4,asparagus plants,We planted the roots and all seem to be growing slowly. Used plenty of rotted manuer mulch in deep trenches...
1,Disappointed with root quality,"Only time will tell how these asparagus crowns turn out, but my initial reaction is very disappointed. I bought these crowns because I was specifically looking for two year old crowns of the Jersey Supreme variety. Sadly, these crowns seem rather spindly, and are probably only one year old crowns, and small ones at that. Also, the order arrived in four days, but the crowns seemed to be unceremoniously stuffed in a plain paper bag, then boxed up in a USPS box. I'm hoping they all survive, because there was no moisture retaining material and the roots were dry when I received them. It will take some time before I know how well these crowns turn out, and unfortunately the crown size means I'll have to wait an additional year. Maybe I'll come back and revise my review if they turn out spectacularly."
4,Better Than Expected,"I had initially heard that the Killers second CD (Sam's Town) failed in comparision to Hot Fuss. After listening to this album, i have to disagree. I feel that the Killers just took a different direction musically with this album. I also feel that it is just as good as Hot Fuss, If not better. The sixth track, Read My Mind, is an exceptional stand out on this album."
5,The killers don't disappoint,"I had heard some negative reviews about this album, but bought it anyway because I liked the first single and have seen the band perform live several times so I was interested to hear their new stuff.I love this album, yea it's evocative of arena rock, but it works. My favorite songs on the album are the title track sam's town and for reasons unknown. There isn't a single song I didn't like on this album which is a rarity in these times of overproduced rock albums."
5,Caveman's lair,"Let's see where this goes. Sam's Town might be short for Uncle Sam's Town. That then might mean America's Town and then it becomes America's music. That might flow if rock made up a better percentage of the music listened to and purchased in this country. It's not that the genre doesn't have bands with talent. These guys are very good and there are many mmoe; e.g. Hold Steady.. Maybe they're the best American rock band out there now. I have trouble hanging the rock tag on band's like Nickleback that get their primary airplay from the psuedo hair-ballads from the 80s. This disc rocks and if you haven't heard it---get it. Maybe a newer version is on the way. Kind of Shakiraesque in that the song getting all the airplay now is the ""Xmas"" song:A Big Sled and not on this lp. Worth waiting a little bit to see if it gets added to this disc. But don't let this slip by you if you're a rock fan."
5,The most reat album from The Killers,"Contrary to what the critics say, Sam's Town is the best album released by The Killers.This album consolidates the band's career and also defines the visual identity of the members who come to the concerts of the tour in a Mexican style.Highlight the songs ""Read My Mind,"" ""When you were young"" and ""Sam's Town""."
1,one good song,"I am a big Killers fan and found this to me a most dissapointing album. I have listened and listened to it, hoping it would grow on me, but it just gets worse! Even for Killers fans, I would advise not purchasing this."
3,I'm being generous here,"I gave 2 stars because of the vocals on this album. I was confused. Usally a band gets better with time...not worse. Durring many of the songs, the lead would dip in to this wavey and horendously off key voice. This is not what I expected from the formerly talented singer. Not to mention, MANY of the song felt like they lasted for hours. It was just borring. I gave this album an additonal star because they tried. So that's a total of three...sorry guys..."
2,Not very good.,"I bought this because I quite liked their first album and was hoping for more of the same. My hopes are now dashed. The only elaboration I can offer is that it's intensely boring and the lead singer's voice is somehow far more irritating on this album than it was on hot fuss.In the interest of full disclosure, I probably wouldn't have bothered to write this review if it weren't for their inane comments about green day's ""american idiot."" I had already concluded this new album is bad before then, but probably would have kept it to myself. I award it two stars instead of one because I feel guilty about the conflict of interest.[after giving it one more try, i came back to try to take back the second star (but amazon won't let me). this album is just too awful for words. i guess if you like/can stand it, more power to you.]"
1,What happened?,"It's hard to even describe just how disappointed I am in this CD. I honestly wish I could give it no stars. There are tons of new CDs out this fall and this is the one that I had been anticipating the most. It's been the most disappointing of the lot. The style of the CD is nothing like Hot Fuss, and I have no problem letting my favorite bands try new things so they can grow in different directions, but this is too different for me. Entetainment Weekly gave it a C, so did Rolling Stone. It's more reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen than the up-tempo, danceable hits I've come to expect from this band. Maudlin is an understatement."
3,"Not a Fan, Just Interested in the Music","I'm not a Killers fan. I liked a few tracks from ""Hot Fuss"", but I was not impressed enough to become a fan. However, upon first listen to ""Sam's Town"", I was more inclined to take another look at the band.Admittedly, I am not a fan still. But, I am interested in the music and the genre that the band attempts to create. It's not a pop/rock, and it's not an alternative. It's like a fusion, with a little techo mixed in. For some reason, Flowers' voice flows over certain tracks. And, interestingly, the poetic and sometimes over the top lyircs work well at times.However, it's the hit and iss that makes this album fall short. While you have highs like ""Uncle Johnny"" and ""For Reasons Unknown"", there are lows like ""My List"". Still the overall storyline effect the band was going for is executed, however unstable it may be.Not the best sophomore effort, but not the worst. Worth a listen for tracks listed as highs with the addition of ""Read My Mind"" and ""Bones"""
5,Really great...,I have to say on the first listen I was dissapointed. It is a bit of a departure from the style of their first album. After I got over that I realized I love this album It is awesome! Every track is just what I want. I love it.
2,Sad But True.,Let me start out by saying im not the type to give negative reviews because i hate reading the typical slamming of new cds which is all to common on here.However since Hot Fuss was such a classic' my expectations were pretty high.With that being said this cd is just plain awful.Other than the Lead off Single which took quite a few listens i really dont hear another single on this cd.Its just missing great songs and Brandon's vocals are pretty poor on this release.Play Hot Fuss again and listen to all the Killer...Pardon the Pun.. Songs on that cd.Where on Sam's Town are the great songs like.SOMEBODY TOLD ME... MR BRIGHTSIDE ALL THE THINGS IVE DONE and many many more.I just dont understand the road they have gone down.As most of the Mag reviews i have read confirm' this cd is just a big mess.As for his claim its the best cd in the past 20 years.. Its not even the best cd out this week.I really wanted to like this cd but im afraid after 5 plays i cannot.
3,Sophmore slump??,"I absolutely ADORED Hot Fuss, and was excited about the Release of Sam's Town. After several back-to-back listens, I had to say that it just sounded overdone. They had new producers with much bigger budgets, but to me, the music just didn't have the in-your-face, raw emotion that I came to expect from this band. However... check out the Spider-Man 3 Soundtrack - the first 30 seconds of ""Move Away"" let me know that the Killers are still rockin'! It's my 8 year-old son's favorite track on the disc, and we listen to the Spiderman 3 soundtrack constantly."
5,Finally!!!,"Honestly, the reason why I even checked out The Killers was because I heard they are from Vegas, and there aren't that many decent bands from my home state. Then I saw the video for ""Bones"" on MTV and loved the song, went to I-tunes and sampled the rest of Sam's Town's songs, and got the cd. It's my favorite cd since Eminem's ""The Eminem Show"" (yes, I have very weird musical tastes). I grew up on 80's new wave and rock, and The Killers remind me of a time when music was about something other than bling or how miserable the world is. And I can actually listen to the whole cd with my 10 year old niece in the car, since there is no foul language or graphic lyrics about drugs and sex... maybe I'm getting old but it's a refreshing change. All in all, it's fun, catchy, straight-up rock-n-roll. I'm very proud of my home-state representation in current pop music."
3,Fewer Highlights,"Compared to ""Hot Fuss"" and ""Sawdust"" this album is a bit of a disappointment. The musicianship and the sounds are there, but somehow I feel, when listening to the album that there is a lack of good memorable songs - at least compared to the two afore-mentioned albums.""When We Were Young"" is a great indie-pop rocker and a deserved big hit song. ""Bones"" is okay but no more; it has a great video by the way. Third single ""Read My Mind"" is quite good and another of the releatively few highlights.The title track is much better in the ""Sawdust"" version - somehow the great melody is lost in this upbeat version. I quite like the closing track ""Exitlude"" in spite of its obviously unpretentious approach.The rest of the songs don't really stick with me."
4,A New Wave-Revival Once Again,"This album does not have many dance-punk tracks as the first album. I loved most tracks on their album ""Hot Fuss."" You definately still hear the new-wave sounds in this new album. The Killers are fortunate for becoming a mainstream band you hear on the radio, unlike many bands that have a close sound to 'The Killers' but stay in the indie scene. As an indie fan, they are one of the very few bands I like from modern radio. For all you fans of 80's influenced or new wave/post-punk rock bands like 'The Killers' you should try listening to these 2 indie rock bands: ""Editors"" who have an album called ""The Back Room"" and ""The Stills"" who have an album called ""Logic Will Break Your Heart"""
4,Solid but different,"It's a good album. It definitely does not sound like their debut album, but it's not bad at all. Fewer songs stick out individually to me, but the album as a whole flows better."
2,Not good . . . .,"I really liked Hot Fuss. I have no idea what happened to the Killers from the time they released Hot Fuss until now but they need to fire who ever is advising them on their career. There are at most two stand out songs on this album and the rest are very disappointing (even the ""standouts"" are disappointing). I do hear the Bruce Springsteen and U2 influences. But the Killers will never EVER make an album as good as U2's best (arguably Achtung Baby). And I agree with one of the other posters when he/she said they didn't even make the best album released on the same day . . . that was The Information by Beck (if you haven't already gotten it, put down this horrendous album and go get it now)."
2,This album sucks!!!!!,"My brother bought this album because he liked the song ""When You Were Young"" and wanted to see what else the killer's had to offer. While he was at work, I listened to it, and When you were young was the only song I liked on the disc!! I wouldn't waste money on this cd but thats just me. See for yourself by listening to sample's."
1,BRANDON OWES ME MONEY!!,"I'll never get it back, but I deserve a refund. LIES! ALL LIES!! Springsteen?? Vintage U2??? Are you completely delusional? This is utter garbage! If it echoes anything it's the absolute worst of 80's new-wave dreck. Have you ever heard DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN or JOSHUA TREE? What the HELL are you people talking about? Please, I beg of you, go find an ADVERTS album or THE ONLY ONES and then tell me how much you love SAM'S TOWN. Until then I'm listening to MINOR THREAT cuz ""I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT""!"
1,A horrible disappointment,"I was a huge fan of Hot Fuss, but this album is honestly one of the worst albums I've ever heard. If this was a new band just coming out with their debut album it would sell about 20-30 copies and it would be bought by family members and close friends. Seriously...that's how bad this album is. I'm not saying this because I have something against the Killers, their first album is amazing. I have absolutely no idea what happened. Brandon Flowers' ego got completely out of control and they have made one of the most pompous, overblown, utterly ridiculous albums in the history of rock music. I really have no idea how anyone in the world can give this album 4 stars, there isn't a single good song on the entire album. The songs are terrible, the vocals are nasally and messy, the lyrics are stupid and unoriginal, and the arrangements are cheesy. Please don't waste your time or money on this album. Sorry Killers fans, I'm just as disappointed as you are."
1,Who wants glam Springsteen? Refund please...,"I would much rather hear this band do a great Smith's/Psych Furs impression (as on Hot Fuss) than a godawful one of Springsteen/U2. Unfortunately, Sam's town is the later. The Killers are no longer a guilty pleasure. The sophomore jinx lives...and the only listeners giving their latest disc a decent review are those who don't want to admit that they just blew $15. Denial is a powerful thing."
5,Another Killer of an Album,"The Killers have done it again, brought us an amazing blaze of an album that showcases their unique talent, consummate musicianship, and unusual choices in genre. They have moved beyond the new wave pop sound of Hot Fuss and gone back in time, reigniting the sound of Roy Orbison and creating the soundtrack to the lost Wild West of their birthplace and birthright. They have infused this mix with their typical desperation and ramping guitar sound to show us how truly gifted and idiosyncratic these boys really are. Get it, play it. This one is destined to become another classic."
3,A Couple GREAT songs you might not hear on the radio.,"There are 2 GREAT songs on this record, ""Bling"" and ""Read My Mind."" This album definitely shows the artists are growing. Sometimes it sounds like the lead singer, Brandon Flowers, is imitating someone else (Bruce Springsteen especially.)"
3,The Killers --- Not So Good,"Upfront I must admit that I am 55 years old and maybe I am just out of the demographic for this stuff nowadays. I bought this based on the reccomendation of my kids, (Should have seen this coming, since they have led me to other stuff that was just a bit beyond my comprehension at my rapidly advancing age.), but alas I was not impressed by what I heard.It is just too dark and gloomy for my taste. I have by the way worn out my copy of Costello Music by the Fratellis so I think there may just be hope for the old geezer! LOL :)"
2,What happened? Who is this band?,"What happened to the band that recorded ""Hot Fuss""? What happened to the electro-dance charged, hi-energy rock-poppy group that recorded ""Somebody told me"" and ""Mr. Brightside""? I remember in the press this band was hailed as the best British rock band to come from America. This is definitely not the same band. This group sounds like the E-Street band fronted by Robert Smith. If you liked their last album, pass on this one. If you dig more ""adult-contempory"" stuff, this may be right up your alley. Not the worst album I've ever heard, but thank god for P2P (limewire/Kazaa/Bittorrent) else I may have been sukered into buying this one. If you like the electro-dance punk sound go check out a band called ""The Faint"". They'll pick up where this once-great band left off.As a side note, Mr. Flowers has a fantastic voice on the last album.. Theres some real studio magic going on there.. I saw them live and that guy sounds terrible!"
1,This album is a complete mess.,"The Killers aren't 'maturing' with this album, it's a mess. They tried to show some depth and failed miserably. The entire album is full of filler songs and background music. Weak vocals, lame lyrics and boring tracks are a common theme with this release. If there was no 'Hot Fuss', this album would have been laughed out of the studio. Stay away from this one folks.One other thing, this site is flooded with so many fake positive reviews, it's ridiculous. Please look at reviews outside of this website and you will see that this album is receiving poor reviews everywhere. Amazon needs to start cracking down on false reviews."
2,Highly Dissapointing,"After arguing with my friends endlessly and listening to the album about 10 times...i realize that its not as bad as I thought it was. While not completely horrible...its just not the Killers. The music lacks energy and the styling of the last album. Not worth the buy, unless you can pick it up for less that $10. I'm completely dissapointed in them. Best songs - When you were young, For Reasons Unknown, Read my mind."
3,A Bit Of A Sophomore Slump,"I was expecting pretty much what I got from this album. The Killers' first album was tremendous, a pop/rock classic in an age that's rejected the style. Nearly single-handedly (okay, Franz Ferdinand helped), the Killers have brought power pop back to the mainstream. In places, the band does try to take some style and songwriting steps forward, but they just seem to be a bit over their heads when they do it. I have to hope that this doesn't sentence the band to the same fate as bands like Love And Rockets and Cutting Crew, who had a moment in the sun and promptly disappeared. The best songs - ""When You Were Young "", ""Bling"", ""Read My Mind"" and ""The River Is Wild"" - are credible, but they don't break any new ground. When the time comes to make their third album, the Killers need to be ready to explore new styles or they might not have a fourth chance with a major label."
3,Slower Paced Killers Album,"I found Sam's Town to be a much slower album than Hot Fuss. Many of the songs are more lullaby in tone and melodic. It's a much different sound for the Killers and I'm not sure that I like it that well. The album has a very somber tone to it that contrasts sharply with Hot Fuss. Interestingly, this is the first album that the Killers did not use auto-tune with. Therefore, Brandon Flowers' voice is really heard on these tracks which gives it a much more authentic feel. Overall, it's not my favorite Killers album but it does include a number of good tracks including ""When You Were Young."""
4,"The Killers kill it on ""When you were Young""",I am enjoying this album. There are a few songs I can't get into but for the most part it is very good.
4,Another great album,It has a lot of great songs. Some are not my favorite but all and all well worth the money.
5,Great New Sound,"I love the new sound of this cd. The Killers have shown that they are not just a ""one hit wonder"", they have depth, imagination and the willingness to take a risk and try something new. Very uplifting music."
2,What a disappointment,"With most bands, the sophomore effort isn't as good as the first. The Killers are poster children for a less than stellar sophomore album. While I wasn't expecting ""Hot Fuss v. 2.0"", I was expecting the same level of awesome, if you will. Unlike Hot Fuss which was refreshing and memorable, this is rather dull and forgettable. One word that keeps coming mind to describe this album is ""themed"". All the tracks seem to related somehow; they all sound the same. They seem to just blend together. It's so boring that with as many times as I've listened to it, none of the songs really stick out to me. I'm honestly surprised I can even sing along to any of the songs. You're much better off just sticking with ""Hot Fuss"" and ""Sawdust""."
3,Not as good as the first album,"Don't get me wrong; I liked this album. But I liked it more the second time around; the first time I thought ""well, there are a couple of good songs, but overall I'm not impressed."""
5,I liked the albun..nuff said!,"Listened to the Killers new album Sam's Town, although not Hot Fuss at all it was still good!"
2,Weak effort,"The only two good tracks on this record are the radio hit ""When You Were Young"" and ""Uncle Jonny."" Other than that, I think the album was a pretty weak effort. If you want to hear a good 2nd album of a band that came out about the same time, check out Keane's brilliant follow-up to ""Hopes and Fears,"" ""Under the Iron Sea."""
2,Not what I expected....,"I was excited about this album when I first bought it. Hot Fuss is a great album, and I was expecting the same out of Sam's Town. I have to say I'm terribly disappointed..... I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about. I find this album annoying, and thats mostly due to the voclas. Apparently, someone thought it was a good idea for Flowers to kick it up an octave or five, as he spends most of Sam's Town in a shaky, blood-curdling falsetto that makes me want to gouge my own eyes out with rusty utensils. They also seem to have dropped whatever vocal effect they had on Flowers in Hot Fuss, which is far from an improvement, given his choice of vocal style in this album. Every warble and break is crystal clear. And the ""harmonies"" are questionable at best (For Reasons Unknown comes to mind). What happened to the good old Smile-Like-You-Mean-It Killers? Their sound has changed completely...... and not for the better. I only hope the third time's a charm for these guys."
2,Down The Drain,"Killers were to save the world, until this bomb dropped. Great first 2 songs, only for this album to dissolve into a pukey panic attack. Flat production, overly wordy nervous singer dooms ""Sams Town"" into the used bin. Surprisingly utterly forgettable, some tracks deserving the skip button. Higher expectations drive this down to 2 stars maybe less. Unfortunate, we must look for new saviors"
1,Disappointment of the year,"The anticipation for this album was nothing more than just wasted energy. Although the reasons to hate Sam's Town are too numerous to mention, the primary reasons include horrible lyrics and a train wreck of sounds on par with that of a high school age DJ.My first two trips through Sam's Town had me cringing in embarrassment for Brandon and his crew, however, When You Were Young is pretty good - buy the single and hold on to the memories of Hot Fuss."
2,Sam's Town,Sam's TownI loved the previous album but this one was disappointing; a self-indulgent sophomoric snooze.
4,A Shuttle on a Shockwave Ride,"I can't say I was a fan until I saw the Killers in concert on their 'Sam's Town' tour. That really made me go back and listen to their material with a bit more interest.Save three songs, I think this disk is extremely solid.At first I was put off by the Springsteen-esque riffs in ""When You Were Young"", but they really make them work. And though I loved ""Bones"" when it first came out, I think I overplayed it a bit. It's still good, I just overdid did it.But I am a huge fan of the title track and actually almost all the songs. I can do without ""Uncle Johnny"", ""Bling"" and ""My List"". They are the three that keep this from being a 5-star disk.I even like the ""Enterlude"" and ""Exitlude"" - though like others, I think it would have kind of made more sense for the former song to be the first cut....but that's hardly a big thing."
5,Amazing Songs And Killer Choruses,"This album is simply put, amazing. Beginning with Sam's Town and it's lyrics ""I've got this energy beneath my feet"" which captures the whole album from start to finish as upbeat and catchy. The choruses are wild usually consist of layers, and the lyrics are brillant. I have to admit I was a little uneasy about this album after hearing the songs on Hot Fuss but this album totally blows the first away. It just has an energy about it that makes you feel an urge to sing to every song. Truly amazing. If the Killers next albums are likes this one, I think we can't expect to hear a lot of great music from them to come."
4,"Okay, fine, they win","The title-track opener alone is enough to justify this shameless throwback to the days in your adolescence when everything was so important that you just had to yell something, anything. There may not have been a finer over-the-top rock anthem since ""In a Big Country,"" or, okay, if you insist, ""Born to Run.""Sure, it's derivative -- but if you move in that certain orbit, there's not much chance of escaping the Killers' gravity."
3,The Sophomore Slump Strikes,"I have seen some of the reviews of this album and I have to say some of you are strictly fans of The Killers and this album is not a classic by any stretch. Hot Fuss was a very good album but my problem has always been that The Killers do have some songs that are fillers. This song is filled with them. There are some good songs on here though although I don't believe that anything is as good as the first single When You Were Young. Sam's Town, Bling, and For Reasons Unknown are the other standouts. So, this is not a bad album but they are trying to expand outside of where there strengths are."
1,The Killers are Dead,"Trust me.... I was really pulling for Brandon Flowers to rock this album as he did the first, but I was sadly disappointed. There are a couple of reasons for this. 1- His voice is all over the place. No matter how good of a voice you have, if it is all over the place, and erratic, it still just sounds like noise. 2- The songs just plain suck. I have listened to this album all the way through at least 5 times, and I'm just not seeing it. I don't know how someone could possibly compare this album to the first. The quality, sound and overall experience are not even close to that of Hot Fuss. For everyone contemplating purchasing this album, keep your money in your pocket, and wait to see what comes next. Hopefully you have better luck next time boys."
3,"Different. Some good tracks, others are dissapointing.","I was really anticipating this album and I have to admit I was a little dissapointed. In my opinion, there are some good songs (I really like ""Read My Mind"", ""Bones"" and ""Bling""). But on other tracks like ""For Reasons Unknown"" and ""Uncle Johnny"", the lyrics and music sounds like Blink-182 6 years ago and the vocals sound like all the generic ""emo"" music that popular now. In summary, theres a few good songs but I think the album fails. I also think it doesnt demonstrate ""growth"" because they went from sounding distinctive to sounding like every other band now. Also, no, the lyrics are not that profound, if you care about that.Someone mentioned that this isn't even the best album that came out on October 3rd, because Beck released The Information. Id like to add, that The Decemberists came out with The Crane Wife on that day as well, and its also way better than this."
2,"""Sam's Town"" Stinks","This record is a hopelessly flawed sophmore effort. It starts out reasonably well with ""Sam's Town"", an OK rock number. ""When You We're Young"" is the only real single and the album's sole bright spot. Beyond that, it's a waste of plastic. They've even gone to the point of remixing tracks like ""Read My Mind"" into synth-dance numbers to make them more palatable to radio. Probably what they should have done in the first place. Synths, sizzling guitars, screaming vocals and the posh disco polish from ""Hot Fuss"" have been replaced by banal lyrics, over-production, and Brandon Flowers' overdone tremolo vocal style. He's well on his way to becoming the Dennis DeYoung (Styx) of his generation, a shameless ham with no clue how bad he is. Fix it boys, and soon."
3,Come one people,"This album is not a classic or worth five stars. A classic album is an album worth five stars and is an OUTSTANDING album. A true classic, one that will be played for YEARS to come. Like U2's Joshua Tree or Paul Simon's Graceland. Please people, remember this when you dish out stars or call albums classics.This is a pretty cool album. A album that you can put into the CD player and will make the drive that bad. Pretty good music, good beats, and not horrible singing."
2,This album is nothing but self-indulgent emptiness,"I wish I had read more about it before I went out and bought this. Other than the first single ""When You Were Young"" the album is very thin on likeable songs. The lyrics are embarassingly cheesy, particularly on ""Bling (Confessions of a King)"". I understand that bands have to switch styles and try something different, but this attempt at originality results in a stale, forced, unimaginative disaster of an album.And after reading that the lead singer said this album is better than ""OK Computer"" I seriously think he is as delusional as he is bankrupt of talent.Buy and enjoy ""Hot Fuss"" but skip this album. It's simply garbage."
2,Sam's Town,"I find it quite unfortunate that with every release, The Killers sound worse and worse. This was a pretty big letdown after their highly successful debut, Hot Fuss. I've never really been a huge Killers fan, but I figured I'd give this album a listen after enjoying most of their first one. It was evident from the first five seconds that they'd over do it with the keyboards. For me, keyboards are definately hit-or-miss, and The Killers missed on their sophomore album. Aside from the album being drenched in unnecessary keyboards, it wasn't to incredibly awful. After a few listens, most of the tracks weren't half bad, and I started to focus on the positives. I liked that the album recieved less mainstream attention than their debut and that the album only included one ""Mr. Brightside"" that was constantly on the radio and everywhere else. Also, I've always really like Brandon Flowers' voice. It's incredibly unique and in a strange way, very soothing."
5,"""Left a trail of excuses...""","Sam's Town by The Killers is their best album to date. Why does everybody despise this album so much? It's amazing, catchy, has great hooks, and just pure fun. Standout tracks include: Read My Mind, For Reasons Unknown, This River is Wild, My List, Bling, and Sam's Town. The Killer's style of music is somewhat similar to my other favorite band, Garbage. The music is incredible, Brandon Flowers vocals are spot-on. Give this album a chance and forget what the critcs have said. I highly recommend this masterpiece!"
4,It's a good album!,"Sam's Town is a good album. I wasn't expecting it to be a Hot Fuss remake. It shouldn't of been. They are writing music how they want it. I agree the first half is solid and catchy and then dips but overall it's worth the greenbacks. The production is perfect and the guitars are louder and take a front seat to the synth on Hot Fuss.I am not sure why everyone is bashing it. It's far from a failure. Anyways, it's probably the closest thing to real rock and roll in these strange musical times. Buy it and it will grow on ya. I loved it after the first time I put it in. Now i can't stop listening to ""Read My Mind,"" ""Sam's Town"" and ""When You Were Young."""
3,Great second album,"If you are looking for the music that came from Hot Fuss, you won't find it on Sam's Town. This is a great second album, for a great band, with an equal great sound. Like most people, I was expecting the same great work that was put into Hot Fuss. However, I heard a great sound, but yet different from what we heard from their first album. I urge everyone to give this album a chance, and you will enjoy the band all over again."
4,I've enjoyed my stay at Sam's Town!,"The Killers finally came out with their sophomore album and it does not dissapoint. Sure, it is definitely not the same as ""Hot Fuss"", but why would we want it to be? The Killers are like every other successful musical artist, always changing and evolving; that is the point of music! If you like the kind of songs that are catchy right off the bat (like 'Somebody Told Me'), this album might not be for you. You need to listen to the songs at least twice to truly appreciate them. No doubt, The Killers are here to stay!BEST SONGS: ""This River Is Wild"", ""For Reasons Unknown"", ""Read My Mind"", and ""When You Were Young""."
5,i really liked it,"I bought this album the other day along with Eyes Open by Snow Patrol (not a bad album) and I was not disappointed at all. Yes, Hot Fuss was an incredible album, and it is hard to follow up to the success of that, but The Killers do a good job nonetheless.The hit single, ""When You Were Young"" displays qualities reminiscent of ""Mr. Brightside"" (the hit off Hot Fuss). As always, Flowers' vocals are great and the lyrics are powerful.However, the most underrated song on this album is definitely ""Uncle Johnny."" The guitars on this song are so good, and the lyrics and vocals are good, too.Thanks, Killers!"
4,"Metaphoric, Melodramatic, Mythic","This is a Homer-esque story about a primitive group of people (much like say ancient Greeks from a peasant village) who must a climb a mountain. It's a titanic mountain, dominating the landscape of their planet. The narrative has a mythic sense because these poor ignorant people are actually courageous and resilient, much like the voyages of Odysseus. The breadth of experience felt bigger than the typical pulp sci-fi novel.I'd imagine you'd hate it instead if you didn't like the characters, since they are such a big part of what is going on. But much like an ancient parable, I enjoyed the journey of these exiled wanderers, facing a rite of passage, as they gradually climbed up the mountain, gaining enlightenment/disillusionment as they climbed.Recommended fiction, if you are an intellectual, allegorical type of mood. An artful story."
2,Nice but forgettable,"This record is in the style of Low and Jessica Bailliff and perhaps Movietone, but lacks something that makes it a special album instead of just a very nice, silent and fragile sounding album which drifts by one minute and forgotten the next."
4,Ignore the below review,"Please ignore the previous review.It may not be the Authors best work, but was written BY the Author in 1987."
2,Just read Mists of Avalon,"Having enjoyed Mists of Avalon as a girl and then actually teaching it, it is easy to see that I am a big fan of the Mists of Avalon. I have also read other Bradley books, therefore I knew what to expect when I read this novel. Having read this novel right after Margaret George's Helen of Troy: A Novel, I was sadly disappointed. I must agree with other reviewers in that this particular novel is fiercely similar to Mists of Avalon, specifically in premise and characters, i.e. a young maiden of royal blood is placed with an aunt who schools her in the ways of earth and the goddess. She falls in love but that cannot be. She has a brother that is known to her but not to him until much later. The similarities just got to be too much for me and that simply ruined the book for me. As I stated before, in George's ""Helen of Troy,"" Kassandra is a very minor character, but I just felt more involved in that novel."
4,The Firebrand,"The Firebrand is a refreshing take on the Trojan War told from the point of view of Kassandra, a daughter of Priam and Priestess of Apollo. From a young age, Kassandra has had the not entirely welcome ability to foresee the future, which often includes visions of ships in the harbour and Troy burning. When Helen of Sparta comes to Troy as the new wife of Paris, Kassandra knows that this means trouble, but no one will believe her until it is too late.Kassandra is a strong character who rejects the roles for women in her predominately male world and struggles to find her own path, be it as an Amazon warrior or a priestess. The telling of the fall of Troy through a woman's eyes is a unique view that is well worth reading. By showing Kassandra's learning to be a priestess of Apollo as well as serving the Serpent Mother, new aspects are added to this tale to keep the reader entertained, since most readers know the basic story and plot already. Recommended for history and mythology lovers."
5,Firebrand,"As always, Marion Zimmer Bradley is awesome. I read this book years ago and loved it then. A second look was not disappointing. She just has a way of putting the reader at ease right from the start and the story just draws you in. She brings to our attention the lesser known aspects of a story that has been written and re-written and brings a fresh new life and many new twists to a story that you thought you already knew."
4,The Mists of Avalon is still my favorite,"I definitely, definitely like this book, no question about it. It's well-written, meticulously looked into by Marion Zimmer Bradley to give it an authentic feel, and an easy read.But if, like me, you're looking for lots of magic, then Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon will probably be a bit better suited to your taste. (It also portrayed more three-dimensional characters, in my opinion.)The Firebrand has more of a historical feel in the way it's told as compared to the Otherworldliness of Mists. But it's certainly good, too."
4,I liked it better the second time...,"...but I still think the book has no true ending. The story is richly detailed and then suddenly skates across the surface of significant events and life changes. Also, it's far too modern in its sensibilities. I suspect that you wouldn't find contemporary gender issues debated in am ancient matriarchal society--not because they would be settled differently, but because survival (and hence social, political, and theological structures) would be very different. Still, it's a good, fast read that entertains."
2,Boring Trojan Epic,"Fans of Bradley's masterwork, THE MISTS OF AVALON, will find little to recommend this retelling of another famous legend. FIREBRAND tells the story of the Trojan war from the viewpoint of Kassandra the shunned prophetess, who is nothing like the deep and resonant characters of King Arthur's realm. Bradley's interpretations of some of the supernatural events of the tale (either more divine or more prosaic than in the legend) are interesting, but hardly worth reading the whole long, at times very boring, tale."
3,Plain...,"Unfortunately this book pales in comparison to ""Mists of Avalon"": although the mythology is as legendary as the ones of King Arthur's era, characters are plain, one-dimensional and some of them simply deserve to be killed because of their stubborness or arrogancy. Lady Cassandra seems to be the one sober among them, but as noone listens to her prophecies, they will end up in troubles, it is clear from the start. Positive side: if you want to know who was who in legend of Troy, read this book..."
2,Not very good,"Once you get past MZB's insessant ""male religions are bad, female religions are good"", you get... not a whole heck of a lot, I'm afraid, other than anarchronisms and plain wrong history. Feel free to pass this one by."
3,"""Mists""-lite","In this retelling of the Trojan war from Kassandra's point of view, Marion Zimmer Bradley re-explores some of the themes she previously visited in THE MISTS OF AVALON, including an ancient, Goddess-centered and feminine-centered religion that is slowly fading away before a newer, male-oriented religion, as well as a retelling of mythological/historical events from a female viewpoint. This is not as well done as in Mists, partly because we remain locked in Kassandra's single viewpoint the whole time and therefore lose the breadth and scope that made Mists so memorable, and partly because she did it before so the characters do not seem as original. However, this is still an interesting and engrossing book, and an interesting and different take on the Trojan war."
4,"Worth reading, but...","The Firebrand was, without question, an intriguing book. My own impression of it was probably colored greatly by the fact that I had already read Bradley's more famous Mists of Avalon, and it's hard to read these two books without noting the similarities in the focal characters of Kassandra and Morgaine. Which is not to say Bradley didn't do a fine job of either one, except that in the Firebrand, Kassandra as a tormented warrior-priestess somehow lacks the depth that Morgaine possessed; perhaps she would have seemed more real had Bradley not tried so hard to mimic what had worked so well previously. Characterization on the Firebrand seemed forced, relying too heavily on stereotypes at times to be believable. That being said, the Firebrand is easy to read, extremely engaging, and definitly worth reading if you're interested in Greek mythology."
5,Wonderful!,"I really enjoy Greek mythology and Marion Zimmer Bradley is an awesome storyteller. One gets a new view of the Kassandra myth, from Kassandra's point of view. A great book, I strongly recommend it."
5,Looks good.,Item looks good. Previous one was identical and lasted over 15 years before paint wore off. Excellent buy.
4,It's a soap dish....,"Arrived on time, product as advertised, seems well made for the price, will do business again. Trying to find Oiled bronzed version - doesn't exist - had to paint."
3,You'll need more than this book to learn VBA,This is a fairly good book for those that want to learn VBA in the Excel environment period. Want to learn more powerful features find a better book.
3,Good references for some topics...,"...such as pivot tables and customising the Excel environment. The other topics in the book aren't covered in as much detail. The section on DAO is little more than a description of the objecy model, with few useful samples, and why is there no mention of using class modules?"
2,"Trys to cover too much, with too little","This book has excellent promise as far as the topics covered. However, it merely shows you what can be done, without explaining how to do it. There is much reference to VBA, but very little sytax and coding help. I was very disappointed."
4,JBL Cinema Pro Pack 600II Owner,I recently purchased a JBL Cinema Pro Pack 600II Home Theatre System and I am very happy with it. The system was easy to set up with very good instructions. The sound is great and I love all of the different sound modes available. I have had no problems with it at all! My only complaint would be that the buttons on the remote control are small and that the DVD and Receiver are large in size. I would purchase this unit again.
1,Not worth it!,"I've had nothing but trouble with this system since I got it in June'02. First the receiver wouldn't output video on the video2 port. Service seemed really helpful and responsive at first, they replaced the receiver. Then I tried to play CDs on the DVD player. Nothing but skipping and errors. Support tried to blame it on the CDs, but these were new store bought CDs. Support recommended I take it to an authorized repair facility which I did. After 1-1/2 months, it's still there! They found the problem but JBL won't send them the parts. It's still under warranty!! In 5 months after purchasing this system, I haven't been able to enjoy it. System's initial setup is easy, but is very complex in functionality."
3,"Great Sound, but Ergonomically Challanged Remote","I picked this up at a national chain store for $$$$$. The sound is great for the price. It's still great at $$$$$. The highs are crisp and clear and the base has plenty of punch. The power is more that adequate, and the DVD changer seems to be competently designed. If you're looking for movie theater sound, this system delivers. But the system loses points for the remote. It has tiny buttons labeled with tiny type, all squeezed too close together and incompetently arranged. JBL knows how to make good sound equipment, but they need to repeat Ergonomics 101."
4,Cinema ProPack 600II has worked well for over 1 1/2 years,"We've had this system setup for over 1 1/2 years with no problems at all. It has a good sound that more than fills a 400 s.f. area (tile floors help). The remote is the only minor complaint, as many others have already mentioned. We're about to add a pair of outdoor speakers to the system and aren't sure yet how to do that (the receiver's speaker outputs are limited to the 5 speakers that come with it) but I'm sure there's a way. We feel we got a good bargain on this system and are very pleased with it."
1,About to go Office Space on this piece of cr@p,"I purchased this HTIB back in June of 2002 and was mostly pleased with the picture and sound until late November 2003. Now I experience all of the same problems of the other consumers with poor reviews. With the warranty now over, I'm SOL!CONS: The system didn't come with a powered subwoofer. The remote, DVD player, and receiver were not at all intuitive to use. The remote had poor ergonomics.I'll keep the satellite speakers and center speaker from JBL. But, the non-powered sub, receiver, and DVD players are getting replaced. Like my headline suggests, the DVD player is going to pay for its defectiveness.My advice for newbies to home theatre is to piece together quality components from top manufacturers in each area of a home theatre system."
1,Don't bother.,"I've had one of these for about a year now and I wouldn't do it again. It still sounds good, but the remote is awful and the dvd player is buggy. On mine, it will occasionally lose the picture for no apparent reason, and the only way to get it back is to turn it off and restart the disc."
1,TOO BAD ZERO ISN'T AN OPTION,"SAVE YOUR MONEY,AND AVOID HEADACHES.FROM THE START I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS MENTIONED IN OTHER REVIEWS. THE DVD TRAY DID NOT OPEN.I DID CALL JBL AND ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY SHIPPING SCREWS THAT HAD TO BE REMOVED, AND WAS ADVISED THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY. BUT WAS TOLD THE DVD PLAYER WAS DEFECTIVE AND TO RETURN FOR ANOTHER UNIT. THE OUTPUT OF THE RECEIVER IS MEDIOCRE AT BEST. NO MID RANGE SOUND. THE SUBWOOFER WAS MUDDY AND DISTORTED.THERE AREN'T ANY CONTROLS ON THE SUBWOOFER.I DID RETURN THE UNIT AS INSTRUCTED AND PURCHASED A DIFFERENT BRAND."

5,THE BEST!,"I received the lowercase Lauri puzzle as part of a homeschool curriculum I purchased. I was awe'd by the durability, and the size/thickness of the puzzle. Within 2 months of use, I decided the uppercase set was a must. So glad I purchased these! I use them with my 5 year old and my 3 year old.They will also replace missing parts for life - score!"
5,ABC'S we can handle!,"My 2yr old grandson loves his ""letters"". We make a game out of naming them and taking them out and then saying them again as we put them in. It is fun for him to be able to touch everything at this age and to do the puzzle, also. Really great. He already knows about 80% of the letters."
4,Great karate master's autobiography,"Ninomaya sensei's journey is sure to be enjoyed by all martial arts enthusiasts. Those who study karate or merely wish for a window into its particular flavor and style will find this book revealing. Nothing like the technical tour-de-force of ""Sabaki Method"", ""My Journey"" is a martial arts memoir in the vein of Funakoshi's epic tome, carrying on the bold spirit at the heart of Karate-do."
3,Was Good,Great experience with Amazon dealers as i always do. I will always look to Amazon's website first for future purchases.
4,Good story,enjoyed the story. read it months a go so I don't remember a lot about it. Do remember it was enjoyable.
4,Good read,This book kept my interest until the end. Simple every day western with enough action to keep you going. A good book.
4,great book,the book keeps your interest up and yet it is easy to read. You can leave the book for a few days and pick right up where you left off

5,Too few doing too much in your church?,"Too few doing too much in your church? Too many doing too little? ""Doing Church as a Team"" by Wayne Cordeiro will help you understand the potential of teams and develop team-based ministry. Cordeiro provides motivation more than a detailed process on how to get the job done. However, this Scriptural empowerment coupled with well told stories and examples are just the thing to help people move from the stands to the field, from being spectators to making a real difference for God's Kingdom. When Cordeiro turns to nuts and bolts, he provides an easy to understand, transferable, practical framework for building teams. The questions as the end of each chapter are useful for discussion with leaders or with groups. The principles in this book, properly applied, will get you well on your way to developing and mobilizing healthy ministry teams that use their gifts to accomplish the mission God has given His church."
4,Doing church as a team,An insightful book designed to instruct the church planting leader/christian to operate as a team. The example of the rowing team exerting their energy first as individuals then later as a well trained team summarizes the book. Training is essential in church planting and it successful operation.
4,Half way thru,read about half the book and so far it is a good read. It is a very easy book to read.
5,Poetry that inspires you to think and feel,"The long lines in these poems, the unhurried pace of thoughts developing through images and feelings is a great luxury in a time when the ""entertainment"" half of ""art should be entertaining and enlightening"" has bogged down in clever word play and cliched, short-attention span cues for a limited range of readers.These poems restore the pleasure in the experience of reading: they have something important and interesting to say about the connnections among love, nature, and humankind, and their ways of saying it are fresh and exciting.You will enjoy these poems."
1,this kind of thing rots holes in your head.,"i dont really have much more to say than that kid rock isnt a genius hes a joke, and eMpTVs gentrified muzac that they force feed to the youth of today is rotting holes in their heads. o yea and if you need true genius, look to chicago's wesley willis.thank you.anti."
3,Tutoring needed?,"After reading the previous reviews, I'm wondering if any of the listeners/reviewers have considered tutoring. It is always advisable to proofread, and make corrections when needed, before displaying your written work for the public to see. With that said, I never thought that I would be interested in Kid Rock, but the song ""Picture"" definitely caught my attention. I want to listen to more of his songs. I am, however, going to listen to them without my children if there are ""explicit lyrics""."
3,"Love ""picture""",Picture w/ Sheryl Crow is an awesome song! Besides some of the cursing (Damn isn't nessisarly the worst swear word)...sheryl rock is an TOTALLY NICE singer on this song.**Sorry I haven't heard the rest but I bet there just as good**;)
1,Cocky Indeed,"First of all, all he does is sing about his money that he made from making his first album. Wow, I don't care! Think of some lyrics that mean something. And he obviously has no brain because he thinks he makes punk rock. Whenever i hear ""Forever"" on the radio I laugh at it, and change the station, because it isnt music, it is a joke. Mixing country and rap together is not such a good idea. What makes me mad is, in an interview he said Radiohead is terrible. Well, look at yourself, kid. You have no right to say Radiohead is terrible, because they aren't, and you are. I wish I could give this 0 stars. Just look at his name, ""Kid Rock"" thats exactly what it is, Rock for Kids. 8 year old kids that will buy this and listen to it once or twice.Buy this if you want something to laugh at, because it certainly isn't ""music""."
1,Still Waiting,"We are writing to let you know that we still have not received the CD we purchased.Can you please look into why we have not received it?Thank you,Dave Wood"
3,Not like Devil without a cause,"This CD isn't bad, but it really isn't good. I love the first song, Trucker Anthem, and Uncle Kracker started the CD off right, followed by a couple great Kid Rock Verses. After that it is all down hill. Songs 2-4 are good, and I for some reason really like what I learned out on the road, but other than those songs, I don't like any other ones except WSCR with Snoop Dogg."
5,Kid Rock can really rock,"What can I say? I fell in love with the song ""Picture"" and bought the 'clean' version of Cocky for this song with Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow. I am now in love with Kid Rock, RAP (me?) for the first time in my life (I am 54!) and fully intend to buy the Cocky version with the explicit lyrics now. This is different from the rap I have heard before, I like the slightly country sound too. The music is great and the Kid has a wonderful [] voice."
2,this gimmick is getting old,"Devil Without a Cause was much better than this album. Kid Rock adds a rock element to rap that is kind of cool, too bad his song writing skills arent that good. There are a few good songs on this album but alot of crap to go through to get to the good. Some of the songs sound like country, which is bad. Some of his lyrics are incredibly retarded sounding. My advise to you, find this album on the internet and download it for free cause it isnt worth the money. Kid Rock has talent but needs some different producers to help him make an album that really kicks butt. Trent Reznor should produce his next album, bottom line, cause I said so."
3,He could have Done WAY BETTER,"What happened with him is that he was trying to decide which route to go down. Sorry kid, but some songs just weren't working. You can't have one song that screams about how many records you sold and then follow it up with a country-love ballad. You gotta pick one and stick with it.2 best songs-Forever & Cocky2 worst songs-baby come home & lonely road of faith"
3,KID ROCK HAS DEFINETLY gone soft,"that white guy gone softer then uncle krackers ""follow me"" bullSH!t. there are some good songs, but rather just download the cd from a prog. his other 7 cds were hits. But this one lacks"
1,Poseur,"Kid ""Rock"" is to rock-and-roll what Twinkies are to gourmet cooking. He's a poseur and a pretender, who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- Bob Seeger, Rolling Stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent. Why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available?"
3,Interesting mix,"This is one of those weird albums that has a few good songs, a few songs that grow on you over time and a few songs that at least in my opinion don't fit at all.The Trucker Anthem, the title track Cocky, Picture (feat. Sheryl Crow) and WSCR (bonus track feat. Snoop Dogg) are all songs that I really enjoyed right away. Forever, What I Learned Out On The Road, I'm Wrong But You Ain't Right, Midnight Train To Memphis and Baby Come Home are songs that grew on me after listening to them for a few weeks and at least have good portions while Lay It On Me, Lonely Road Of Faith and I'm A Dog I still don't think fit on the album at all, although the beginning of Lonely Road Of Faith is good, it just doesn't fit with the middle of the song or this album.It has a little something for different tastes however, going from swearing and hard fast lyrics to slow and hypnotizing sways."
4,It's a must buy,"If you're a fan of Kid Rock, this is a must buy. The songlonely road of faith is what sold me. Excellent music to cruiseto or just sit and listen to and chill. Kid Rock shows his capabilityof hitting different music genres."
2,Cocky -I don't know why,"OK, Kid Rock we know you went platinum, but did we have to hear about it in every song. I am sad to say this CD was horrible. I bought his previous CDs and loved both. While I was listening to this CD I could not wait for it to end. I didn't mind the fact that it was mostly southern rock, but the lyrics made no sense. I am a big Lynyrd Skynyrd fan and if I were them I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this CD. The only salvageable song was Picture with Sheryl Crow. This was definitely a half-hearted effort. The only high point to this CD is Twisted Brown Trucker's instrument playing and the background vocals by Uncle Kracker."
3,"Not my cup of tea, but a variety of song styles","Kid Rock is not really my thing - a lot of singing about getting drunk or high. I bought the CD to get the Kid Rock/Sheryl Crow song Picture, which is not available in MP3 format. Though the other songs weren't for me, I was impressed by the diversity of styles in which Kid Rock performs."
2,Not impressed.,I am a big Kid fan...but not this cd. I love Born Free and Rock and Roll Jesus which I think is his best music. I will resell this one.
4,Soccer Mom becomes Kid Rock Fan,"I was only vaguely aware of Kid Rock until I saw the ""Picture"" video on television - but I love that song so I had to buy the CD. Okay, so the language was a little shocking when I first heard it, but suburban soccer moms are probably not his intended audience! But I have to admit I love the CD and the country/rock sound reminds me of my younger and freer college days. So, I am a brand new Kid Rock Fan - but I will only listen to this CD when the kids are at school!"
2,I want my 14$ back,"Kid Rock is one of my most FAVORITE artists, but I have to tell you that I really REALLY don't like this CD. I agree with the other rater, if I had wanted country music, I woulda bought country music. I fell asleep listening to the middle half of this track. From what I can tell, they all sound alike. There is one with Sheryl Crow, that sounded all nice and sappy, but certainly not what you expect from KR. Save your money. Forever was the only good song on this CD.But, if you want proof that KR can sing {personally I thought he'd been faking it, especially after one TV performance I saw(I think the grammy's)}.... he proves that he has some vocal talent on this CD. He isn't using high tech machines to cover up the fact that he can't sing in this one. Personally, I prefer the screaming KR,One word.... boring.another... disappointing"
2,dont waste your money,"i have all of kid rocks albums (including this one, i am sorry to say). the last thing i expected from kid was a bunch of slow music with no beats that sounds like well crap (country and rap). although on the plus side there are 3 good songs, which is more what i expected the cd to sound like, tracks 1,2, and 14. the rest of this cd (is terrible). if you want some good kid rock go pull polyfuze method off of audiogalaxy, but dont waste your time on this."
3,Pretty good,"Music is good as always but I think he needs a new front man like Joey C to make up for da kid's lack of talent in this area. Kid can sing but the rapping is poor and the lyrics are lacking, but again I think the album is pretty good because of the music. The more you listen to the cd, the better it sounds (I think because I get used to the words and ignore them). The snoop song alone might be worth buying the cd (2 classic performers)."
5,I'm Cocky and I say what,This is one of the best kid rock albums yet to date. Cocky was the theme for this years WWF Royal Rumble. One of the greatest songs besides cocky is Lonly road of fath. I cry when i hear that song. This is truly a great album.
4,The best Kid Rock yet!,"He hits a home run. No sleepers here, no track you want to skip over. He has not lost the roots that made him so great back with the Devil Without a Cause CD. He has matured a little and it shows, in a very good way! Thanks Kid Rock, for keepin it rockin and soulful!"
1,"If this keeps up they'll be asking ""kid who?""","Obviously kid rock has taken too many drugs and believed all the hype! Don't wast your money on this cd it is a real ""dud."""
3,Raw but immature,"I'm not a rap fan so that may color my review. I am rock fan, and while Kid Rock does produce some cool rock stretches in his songs the rap seemed to take away from what could be a rockin' CD. Kid can groove, I just wish he would do more of it. The constant profanity does not offend me, it just sounds stupid and gets boring. Overall, this is a fun CD, but I can't listen to more then 2 or 3 songs at a time."
1,Don't buy if you have a computer sound system,"Avoid this one.In a misguided attempt to thwart online exchange of music, this CD is designed to be unplayable on computer CD players. This is a slap in the face, for all those honest folks who are foolish enough to purchase this CD. It is basically useless for modern listening. Kid Rock is great but he should be ashamed of this practice...."
1,kid country,only forever rocks on this cd and let kid get this out of his system know and go back to what he does best rock/rap metal
1,"""It Stinks in here!!... Cuz this CD [stinks]!!!!!!!!!!!","What the Hell is this....!! Give me a break! Kid Rock? More Like Kid Shot!! Cocky? This CD should be called Shotty!! My God, I just heard a Duet with Sheryl Crowe! Whose next? Celine Dion?? Punk Rock mixed with the Hip - Hop? More like Garbage mixed with more Garbage. One of the only bright spots is Snoop Dogg. ""Devil.."" completely blows this away. Kid Rock sold out big time!! What a waste of money....!! Don't waste your money on this!! If you like Rap - Rock, Check out Limp bizkit, Linkin Park, or Rage Against the Machine!! Stay away from this.... What's that Smell!! Oh Yeah, this CD!!"
3,Good..... but not really that Good,"If you're like me, and I know you probably are, you like things that ROCK! Well this album rocks but just not hard enough. I really think things have been downhill for our hero since Joe C bought the farm. What used to be fun now sounds dumb. Hey, if you like chicken and grits and yodeling in the valley you might like this. But if you only listen to MTV stuff you may not like it. The best songs are the ones that ROCK!"
5,Kid Rock Rocks,"This is a great CD! Bought it because of his MTV video Lonely Road Of Faith and I can't put it down. Every day after the markets close we crank this CD. Pure adrenaline. A blend of rock and rap unlike anything else I've heard. More musical than his past albums, Kid Rock has successfully blended rock with rap and even punk to an extent. The harmonies are great, melodies good, rhythms awesome, music energetic, and lyrics are entertaining. There are even some slow songs which are great. What more could you ask for? I've never been a huge rap fan but I like this! I was so impressed with Cocky that I bought his earlier albums (history and devil) which haven't had the same impact yet as this recording. Whether you're new to Kid Rock or not, I highly recommend this CD!"
5,American Badass indeed,A very solid effort.Ever notice how when artists repeat themselves people complain?Ever notice how when artists stretch a bit people complain?I guess you just can't win.I personally love the diversity on this disc.Kid Rock is only getting better.
2,Too Country-ish,"The first record was a good fusion of rap and metal. It was new and interesting, a breath of fresh air from the music industry. This album is mostly country style. Although it is not bad, it is not what I was expecting. The highlight for me is track 6 (I'm Wrong But You Ain't Right) which is pretty solid. The bonus track with Snoop Dogg is a total waste of CD space."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...,"Kid's newest effort, ""Cocky"" is not what I expected. There is way too much country in this album. What happened to the ""Rock"" in Kid Rock? There are only a few hard-rocking songs on the album, and only a few rapcore songs, which is a real dissapontment, since Kid is very good at rapping to a rock beat.Overall, a very good album that will grow on you, but only if you are willing to listen to it more than once..."
4,Good Follow up,"This album has the chick song "" Picture"". I have seen hundreds of women singing the lyrics. I saw them live & the female drummer handled Sheryl Crow's part with ease.You can see that Kid Rock is trying to mix it up a bit with Rap Rock & A little bit of country. Smart move."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah","Look, I liked Kid Rock from back before ""Devil..."" came out and I gotta say that his lastest effort is THE SAME EXACT ALBUM AS THE LAST TWO! Talking about the same stuff, sounding the same...Kid change it up a bit, the redneck rap-metal isn't working anymore."
2,Disappointing Follow up-,"Kid Rock's ""Devil without a cause"" was dangerous, loud, and right there on the forefront Rock/Hip Hop creativity. Then we got ""American Bad-ass"" while not bad in itself. It lacked some of the edge of ""Devil"", but mainstream fans were treated to some of Kid's earlier stuff which i was unfamiliar with. Now with COCKY. Kid Rock does not seem so edgy, or dare I say Hungry anymore? The tracks are a mishmash of different styles, and none of them seem to contain the raw stylings of DWAC. The die hards won't agree, but now Kid just sounds like one of the LOUD, and the tired. A real shame cuz i was one of his biggest fans, and now just feel left in the dust with this endeavor."
2,Kid Rock has gotten way too southern!,"I used to love Kid Rock, that is, until I listened to this album and realized that he has gone WAY TOO SOUTHERN! His last two albums (Devil Without a Cause & History of Rock) were cool, but this new album (Cocky) kind of [is weak]. The only song I liked was Forever. Kid Rock had kind of sold out his rock and pop singing style. Kid Rock has gone country! Avoid this album if you're expecting this to be as cool as his other albums."
1,What happened to Rock?,"I tend to disagree with some of the other raters, I thought a majority of this cd had too much rap influences and not as much rock as before. the song on his last CD, ""American badass"" was great, along with alot of his other songs where there was a little rap influence, but rap seems to have taken over a majority of the songs on this release, I mean come on, snoop on a cd that is supposed to combine rock, rap and COUNTRY?"
2,Don't Buy It!,"Terrible album.It has a couple of songs that sound like Kid Rock's style.Most of the songs are very very country. If I wanted Willie Nelson, I'd have bought Willie Nelson.Usually Rock fuzes rap and metal. In this album he tries to bring country in too, in a big way and I think it fails. The song ""Lonely Road of Faith"" appears to be pandering to the Sept 11 tragedy as a new marketing opportunity. In fact it makes me suspect of the entire work. It makes me wonder if the new direction to fuse with country isn't driven by the marketing execs rather than a true desire on KR's part to go country.Overall the album was preachy and country. If KR keeps this direction, it'll be the last album for me.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one, and I hope I can save others the disappointment."
2,DID YOU HEAR KID ROCK WENT PLATINUM?,"I CAN SUM THIS ALBUM UP VERY EASILY. ""I'M KID ROCK, I'VE GONE PLATINUM, DETRIOT IS WHERE I'M FROM, WHAT'S MY NAME? YEAH, KID ROCK. YEP, FROM DETRIOT. DID I MENTION I'M KID ROCK?"" 'NUFF SAID."
5,The best,I received the CD 3 days after ordering it. It was new and had no defects at all. I am very satisfied with the product.
2,Save your money,"This CD is NOT "" Devil with out a cause "". If you want that sound look somewhere else because you wont find it here. I like country,blues,and rap, but not in the same song!!"
3,Definitly Not Kid's Best.....,"More blues and country....less rapcore. Thats how I describe this album. There are a few rap/rock songs on this CD like Forever, and that track with snoop, which are decent. But most of the songs are blues about his worries and problems in life, probably, and getting high. Well, guess what kid? NOBODY CARES!! He also slurs ALOT....and I MEAN ALOT...against women. (...) If you want Kid Rock, get Devil Without a Cause....end of story. The only reason you should get this CD is if you like blues with curses, and/or from Detroit. Download the decent songs off Morpheus or something....."
2,Kid Rock is back?,"Well this cd doesn't move me like the Kid Rock of the past. There are two great tunes here, serving as bookends to an otherwise gratitious monologue of ""I'm back (...)"" and ""I ain't sold out, (...)"" and ""I'm realy realy rich, (...)"" and stuff like that. WCRS is vintage Kid Rock. There's actually a line bleeped out in this song. Huh? How could there possibly be anything that needed bleeping worse than the stuff they left unbleeped?! Maybe it's just a gimmick. Despite all this self proclaimed greatness and realness where's the tour? (...) Guess he's just going for some Christmas cash. He's got a lot of gifts to buy (...). Mr. Rock also tries to show his sensitive side with songs that sound like James Taylor. I guess the chicks dig it. Whatever..."
3,"Some of it is Cocky, And some of it is just plain (Bad)","WHY NOT JUST GO OUT AND BUY THE ""FOREVER"" SINGLE? Ya' know, in the History of ROCK, the Kid said that his follow-up to Devil Without a Cause would be coming out in the summer of 2001, but then he delayed it to November 6th, to November 20th... and then I FINALLY get a copy of it; and that country (stuff) by itself is cocky nonetheless! NO OFFENSE, KID ROCK, BUT PLEASE PULL YOUR (Act) TOGETHER AND GET BACK TO BEING THE AMERICAN BAD ASS, OTHERWISE YOU ARE GOING TO BE A DEVIL WITHOUT A CARRER... YOU ALREADY SCREWED UP TWO OF YOUR ALBUMS: ""Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast"" AND ""Cocky"" (both of which I had to wait one hell of a long time to get a copy of my own), SO LET'S JUST NOT (Mess) UP ANOTHER ALBUM....... PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,chicago critic,"Great album. The first few songs rock. He does have more slow songs with a country feel than you might expect. A lot of fans are not happy with this, but give it some time. Listen to the full album three or four times and you really get hooked. KR has made huge strides musically and he showcases them on this album. The music arrangements hang together and Twisted Brown Trucker lays down a terrific foundation for KR's vocal flow.Perhaps this album is not as ""angry"" or hardcore as some other fans would have liked, but for me it is a perfect mix. Try it - you'll like it."
1,Poor effort,"I'm not a big fan of Kid Rock, but I thought that Devil without a cause was a good album because the music revealed the defiant nature of the artist. He views himself as someone who is above the rules of every day society (not to imply that he actually is that way in real life). As someone who detests country music, I thought that this album was pretty bad. If you like country then buy it, but if the Kid is trying to pass himself off as a devoted hard Rock and heavy metal/rap artsit, then this album is complete garbage. I would hope that he was capable of putting forth a better effort. My advise, this album is too cocky, avoid it at al costs. Donny Osmunds recent release, ""In the Moment"" or the partridge Family would be a better bet. Nice try Kid, but no cigar, this album bites"
1,Cocky=[junk!],"It's really a shame I can't give this Zero Stars.My name is Kid Rock, I'm from Detroit, I went Platium, I date women with big... and little brains.Multiply what I just wrote by about 14 and you get the gist of what this album is all about. Stupid unintelligent lyrics with the same riffs and beats from the last album."
4,I`m impressed!,"Kid rock sounds a lot like he did on devil without a cause ecpecially cocky which sounds like devil without a cause. I like his flow and i like the way he sounded on this cd a few of the tracks i could do without though were, 7,9,8, and 12."
5,the kids best,I think this is kid rocks best album as yet.There are certain songs that the kid really expresses and i think that he is singing some of the songs to himself.My favorite track would have to be lonley road of faith because he is singing that to all the fans.He has also made a big hit for sheryl crow with picture witch is also a fantastic melodey overall this is a fantastic album and his best one yet.
3,Not his best BUT....,"I dont really like this CD above all the others but it does have its excellent moments. ""Picture"" is a really good song as is ""Forever"" and ""Lonely Road of Faith"" has its place also. I had too listen quite a few times before I started to even LIKE this CD...with the others I kinda liked them from the start...being I dont really like Rap I dont really want to admit that BUT...lol."
3,good for covering purposes,"the cover is good at doing exactly that, covering and protecting the phone, but i had a black one and the paint chipped off very easily, making my phone look very old and dinged up. you could scratch the paint off and it just looked really bad. Still very good at protecting the phone when you drop it, just looks bad with all the color chipped off."
2,georg fredrick handle,sound quality very poor must have been recored many years ago.i was looking forward to this fantastic work but was very disapointed
2,Christmas Music,"I should've realized that this was the actual performance CD of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I was expecting more of a studio version. Although the songs were good, I had to keep adjusting the sound level up and down to hear the music- not an easy thing to do while working, studying or reading. This made it difficult to keep my mind on the work at hand with me constantly getting up to change the dynamics."
2,Not quite enough,"The sound of an amatuer choir works against some creative choices in programming. Although a multi-channel SACD, the recording cannot overcome the dry and cramped sound of the Tabernacle."
1,Terrible,A total disappointment. A Broadway-ish production. The music insipid. The choirs tastelessly arranged and poorly balanced. The instrumentation vulgar. Sounds like music for a Tom and Jerry show. Wasted my money.
5,Great Bang For The Buck!,"I paid [$$$] for this system and am amazed at what I got. The sleek looking system came quickly, and was extremely easy to set up. All of the wires were clearly labeled and, contrary to other reviewers, the sound of the speakers is not tinny. I just watched Lord of the Rings last night, and couldn't tell the difference between the theater and my house. As a matter of fact, I think my house sounded better. Everything (including a tuner) is in one unit and actually freed up a tremendous amount of space in my entertainment center. I would highly recommend this unit!"
3,This was my first DVD player,"I bought it, from amazon, in Sept of 2002 for $220. It died today. What the others say about the remote and the on screen menu is true. It is also true that the sound is great for the price. I used it daily and got my money's worth."
3,price=performance,"...The speakers give you what you expect. The up side is that it does everything you need. I purchased this for use in a temporary apartment and plan to use it later in a guest bedroom. For that purpose, it does just fine at a reasonable price. I would not recommend using this as your main home theatre system: It just won't cut it. I also considered the Magnavox at the same price. I didn't get to listen to either before purchase, so the coin toss led to the Koss system."
1,Be warned!,"This system has no digital inputs, so if you want to use it with an Xbox or a PlayStation 2 for Dolby/DTS playback, you're out of luck.Consider yourself warned."
3,"Fine system, remote is weak",System seems to work fine...operation can be a little slow between modes. biggest issue is the remote which seems to break down quickly...and finding a replacement even with universal remotes is impossible...finally got a learning remote to replace it.
1,Inadequate product with inadequate warranty,"Product purchased through Amazon died after nine months; alas, warranty is only 90 days. No mute button. If you switch from DVD to TV, you must restart DVD from beginning. Speaker are a joke; fortunately, receiver has sufficent power to support my existing rectilinears. Biamped sub-woofer is always on, a power consumer, even when unit is off. Had to purchase a separate RF-generator for $30 to access my TV."
2,Hopeful but Disappointed,"The low price of this product was attractive, and perhaps a red flag, but I have respect for the Koss name, and took a chance. My main complaint is with the noisy cooling fan. (Other reviews had mentioned this flaw as well). Because of the shelving available to me, I need a slim-line unit, and a fan may be the only option for these. I'm guessing the ""fat"" units use heat-sinks instead of fans. I don't really know, but at normal listening levels I found the fan noise distracting.Additionally, after playing around for about two hours, I still couldn't seem to get the decibel levels to adjust for surround. I don't know if it's the system or me, but either way it ends up unsatisfactory.I will spend a little more money for something I like better. The product seems to be made solidly, and the design is attractive, but the downsides makes it unacceptable, and I have returned the system."
1,waste of money,This product worked well for a year. Now the dvd drive is dead. I wish I had spent more money on a better quality system. I purchased this product based on reviews on Amazon.com. $220 down the tubes.
3,"The Title is Over the Top, But I Share The Sentiment","""Through Hope and Despair""? Shouldn't that title be reserved for a book about the civil rights movement, or a survivor's struggle with AIDS? It's a bit hyperbolic to use in the context of this story about the Chicago White Sox's perennial woes -- but since no one else claimed the title first, I guess it's Helpingstine's to use as he sees fit. I love the White Sox, passionately, and so I'm partial to any book about the team. Even one which is written in the meandering, ""first draft"" kind of way which this one is. There are typos, there is flat prose. There is nothing special to remember this book by except that it is one passionate fan's reportage about a team that gets too little credit and attention in the baseball world, but one which stole my heart as a young kid and still clutches it for dear life. Thanks, Dan Helpingstine! I enjoyed your book just fine, warts and all."
4,Great,"The blue birds seem to enjoy this product and they keep coming back, that in it's self speaks for the product."
3,Great toy but did not come in the condition it was described..,"The hat was missing and the toy had a stale odor, so definitely not in ""like new condition""..."
1,Clumsy and not very sturdy,"The extension peices are very clumsy to work with close in, but not sturdy enough to use at full length. I use only two of the four peices and it is OK (but then I am 6' 3) for close in work like cleaning the driveway (I don't have to lean over now), but putting all four peices on and using it at a distance (like it is designed to be used) just doesn't work well."
3,Easy solution to threading problems,"I bought this and have had no problems although I only use two sections. To make it easier when threading plastic parts together I always use silicon spray on both pieces and find that they go together easily. They also come apart easily as I just went in the garage and took apart this extension wand after it's been together three + years. I also spray the undercarriage of lawnmower before using (cleans in a snap), as well the blades and impeller on the snowblower (never clogs even with wet snow) and spray the spark plug wires. Acts as a sealant from moisture. Works well on rubber hoses and seals to make them last longer. Quick connects + the o-rings are a must. Lasts all summer."
1,Hi/Lo pressure wand,"I have had to buy several hi/lo pressure wands from local suppliers, they just don't last.I do not see them listed seperately here, I need another but don't want to buy a set of them and throw money away.I am very unhappy with this product.Can or will you supply only what I need?"
5,Saved my life,"I was an utter emotional wreck after having recently stopped my anti-depressant. I remembered listening to Dr. Watts' lectures on the radio many years ago. After purchasing this book and beginning to read just the first few pages I immediately recognized, in this book, the same wit, humor and insight of his famous lectures. Almost to the point where, at the end of certain phrases or paragaphs, you can almost hear the late dr. laugh. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who remembers Dr. Watts' lectures, who is interested in Zen philosophy or especially to anyone who is searching for their spiritual or emotional center."
5,Great,As with all of Alan Watt's books (that I have read) I am enjoying this one. His ability to articulate without pontificating is what brings me back.
4,Every little girls favorite puppet,This puppet was a great addition to her toy box. It is well made and little girl's love it when they see it...FYI don't pull it out of your diaper bag and try playing with it because a little girl may think it's hers and take it from you at a restaurant. The only down side of this puppet is that it's not really made for big handed people like Dads.
2,Not made for adults,We found that the head was too small to fit either my or my wife's hand. It defeated the purpose of buying a puppet to play with out 6 month old.
2,Gund hand puppet Zoe not that nice,"This purchased as new, not second hand, arrived looking second hand a bit moth eaten but Big bird and Elmo were fine.Gund Zoe Hand Puppet"
2,Gives you the basics,"This book was good in giving you the basics facts of Norris' life, but it left me wanting a more in depth biography along the lines of the one of Jimmy Swaggart done a few years ago. If you want to know the highlights, and low lights read this but if you can just check it out of the library."
1,A Modernist's Opinion of Frank Norris,"If one is looking for an honest, unbiased biography of the great fundamental preacher Frank Norris, as I was, this is not the book to purchase. It is just a waste of your time and money. The author quickly identifies himself as a modernist and a hater of Biblical fundamentalism by his comments regarding Frank Norris. The further I got into the book the worse it got. His attack on Frank Norris is bad enough, but his misinterpretation of fundamentalism and the Bible just go too far. The author is, of course, entitled to be a modernist and not to believe that the King James Bible is the inerrant Word of God, but should not disguise his opinions in the title of the book. This book makes me have second thoughts about purchasing any more books over the internet."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!",I was very excited to get the farret bed but my excitment ended a week after I received the bed. It is a piece of junk. I put it in my farret's cage and a week later the plastic clips (that raise and lower the bed) broke and now it just lays in the cage. My farret wont even use it because it won't hang like he likes it. I wish I never bought it.
2,Hang n bed,It only lasted a couple days with my ferrets. I think the design is bad and should be sown stronger between the straps and the actual bed.
2,Not cozy,This item hanged great very upset that there is no cushion in the bed. My ferret hates it!will not buy another!!
5,This CD Rocks!!!,"I have recently seen 7 Minds live and just had to buy the CD afterwards. The album is very energetic and fun. Although they have some elements of ska, their sound is a nice blend of many styles to keep the listener interested. I highly recommend the CD."
1,Beware of editing!,"If you buy this edition, just be aware that it has been revised to promote a fundamentalist Christian viewpoint."
5,Why pay more?,"If you can get your hands on the 2-part review Sound & Vision Magazine did comparing many of the top rated subs, you will begin to understand what these Amazon reviewers are trying to say regarding the quality. Combine that with the extrordinarily low price, and you have an absolute steal when it comes to supplying your home theater with the low end required to make movies and music come to life. I've had mine for about 2 yrs now and couldn't be happier. At these prices, why not buy two if your room is a little on the large side, or even if you just are looking for that absolute bass ""holy grail"" in a conventionally sized room. You won't regret either."
5,"Shakes the walls, bothers the neighbors, adds great bass... what more could you want from a sub?","I purchased this sub to complement two polk audio speakers for a 2.1 system. After browsing around online as well as some in person visits to stores, this is the most bang for the buck one could get from a sub. Whether watching a movie, or listening to music, the sub adds such rich bottoms, I'm very happy."
5,"JBL S120P II 12"" 400-Watt Powered Subwoofer","Excellent, one of the best purchases that have made. Incredible effect. I wanted to buy other more."
5,JBL SUB,Excellent bass for room size 15 x 12. Used in home cinema system with 92 inch screen and Sanyo projector. Good control of volume and crossover points. Very satisfied for under 300 bucks. Can't beat it.
4,Great Story,"The story is about a family that goes through a lot of family issues; that can shake anyone. The character of Faye is wonderful. She is a very strong woman that has to deal with a lot of these issues by herself. I liked her a lot. Steel presents the husband role masterfully; sometimes I wanted to grab him by the neck and squeeze him. What I like the most about this book is that the issues presented here are very real and can happen to anyone at a given point of our lives. Sometimes the description of a situation is very crude, but is that crudity what made realize that life can be as cruel and crude like that. I strongly recommend this book to any person that has kids, because it helps you to appreciate your kids more."
5,Do you think you have problems?,"If you think that you have problems with your family check this:Five children, one homosexual, one likes drugs, one is dead in a war, one hate her mother because her mother is a winner in life and the last one more or less normal, but these are not all the problems...The story of Faye is well written and the book is very easy to read, it has two or three things that I think couldn't be true but the story of this family will make you think of your family and if you really have problems with your children, this book will open your mind of what to do or how to do things with your children, husband or wife."
2,she wrote better books,"It was hard to finish that book, something very uncommon with her other books that I read in 3 days. Try Mixed Blessings"
5,Esq Squadron,Just got this watch today but I purchased it from a different seller at fraction of the price.So far I am very happy with it. Its a little on the heavy side but otherwise its a great timepiece.The button functions are easy to use as long as you read the manual. The only thing this watch is missing is an ability to light up in the dark.
4,Sounds from outside of this world,"If you are into Indian traditional music, for sure you'll enjoy thoroughlythis recording. This particular instrument (Shehnai) which I've seen written in similar but different ways, has a very intriguing sound that transports you out of this world and this particular musician is one of the most skillful shehnai players in the world. Submerge into India's ancient and mystical sounds. The recording is good and balanced. Perhaps the low frecuencies are somewhat weak but this is easily solved increasing the output level of your subwoofer."
5,Great sound at a very reasonable price.,"The components which most affect -- by far -- the sound of your audio system are the speakers. And (except for electrostatic speakers costing thousands of dollars) the best sounding speakers currently available are those in the JBL studio series -- including the S38IIs. The S38IIs are superb sounding speakers with sweet, clean highs, a natual-sounding midrange, and clean, full bass. While they will handle lots of power, they sound great with moderately-powered amps and receivers. If for some reason you feel that you must have a larger woofer -- instead of the quite-adequate 8"" woofer in the S38II -- I recommend the JBL S310II with a 10"" woofer and the JBL S312II with a 12"" woofer. But the vast majority of people should be quite pleased with the superb sound of the less-expensive S38IIs. Also the S38II speakers would make excellent rear speakers in a terrific-sounding JBL surround sound system."
4,"Solid sound, good price","They have been sounding better and better since purchased. No sub needed plenty of bass with very tight mids and highs. Large for ""Bookshelf Speakers"" and sound better laid horizontally although difficult to find space for them. Best speakers for the dollar, blew away the Bose 301 and other two way bookshelf speakers."
2,I do not like these at all.,I have tried to get used to them hoping they would get better with time. I find them to be very tinnie and flat.
2,"Not bad, but save your money.","Definitely not worth 200-300 bucks if you ask me. The dvd player is poor quality (FF and Rewind make scratching noises and barely work), the surround effects on the receiver are weak, the speakers are really cheaply made. If it breaks, you have nobody to turn to. Mine is experiencing stereo problems after owning for 1 year. I have lots of home stereo experience and I can tell you these problems are with the unit itself and not with my wiring configuration or even the speakers themselves. Because I can't talk to anyone or even ship my unit in for repair, I'm stuck with a faulty unit, and I've essentially thrown $300 down the toilet. Stick with brands that have better support, ie Sony, Aiwa, and the like."
3,Koss Home Theater System,Fairly good sound but what a complicated operating system! Someone ought to re-write the instruction book and re-design the on-screen system. I've never been able to get it to work properly even with a video-s cable. Tapes from the VHS only show in black and white. I'd look at other systems before buying this one.
1,buyers beware,"We bought this home theater system 3 weeks ago. The user's manual was very hard to follow-pictures but no actual words. We finally got it hooked up, and it worked great for the first day, but then we had problems getting it to play dvds consistently. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it would get stuck. We would have to unplug it to reset it. Then after using it a total of ten times, it let out a giant pop and smoke. We returned it to the store and got our money back."
4,Good entry level system,"This is a great entry level system for someone who wants true home theater. The receiver is exceptional and the DVD gives you a crisp, clean picture. The center channel and sub-woofer speakers are excellent and fill up any room with great sound.On the down side the front and real surround speakers aren't much better than ones you get standard with a computer. You will need to upgrade to take advantage of the 400 Watts of power. You will also need to get better speaker wire and the remote isn't very user friendly.All in all you will be very happy with this purchase."
1,Beware,System broke after a month and a half of use. Best Buy would not take it back and you can't get ahold of the manufacturer if your life depended on it. Don't believe me? Search google for this company.
1,It's been a major disappointment...,I bought this Koss system as their headphones have been some of the best but this system theater system is a giant leap downward. Major complaint: it simply won't play a dvd unless it is in pristine condition. About half the DVD's we rent won't play all the way through. Second complaint: the remote is not intuitive and thus very confusing. Now I've got to buy a 2nd DVD player so I can watch videos. Look elsewhere!
4,I Like It!,"As a novice to the world of DVD, I was searching for something, checked BestBuy, KMart, Wal-Mart, wanted to take a ""test drive"" of the DVD movie THE HIRE by BMW. No luck, most places either had nothing I was interested in or they were far too expensive or not interested in assisting me.The price was right, and I especially enjoy both the FM and AM radio reception.The remote control does have too many and too small buttons, has been difficult for me to figure out, but when I do it right everything is great. I still keep the users' manual close by.Getting up to change disks from one to another is a pain sometimes, but I need more exercise.I cannot imagine how that new system Bose is flashing on my screen can be worth over ten times what I paid for the Koss."
5,"Bargain price, great features...","I'm really happy with this unit - it has great sound, all the features work just fine, and I really *love* the built in video switcher that makes using it pretty straightforward.Only negative - KOSS is not listed in my multi-function remote."
2,Head for the Hills,"Thane fans expecting a biography with the drama and character development of her Williamsburg novels, or the inside scoop on her life with ornithologist William Beebe, will be disappointed. This book is, alas, for the birds -- literally, as by far the most verbiage relates to Thane's pet finch and canaries. We learn far more (and care far more) about the inner life of Petey, a canary murdered by a field mouse after a few days on the farm, than we do about Thane or her family. Readers seeking insight into rural Vermont life in the 1940s would do better to try _Mrs. Appleyard's Year_."
2,Returned it!,"Great title, we thought it would fit our home style perfectly and give us lots of ideas. Upon arrival and perusal, I found it overweighted in text and very, very few ideas for us to use in our home. I was amazed at the paucity of photos. Dissappointing."
4,Good Key Holder,"This was a solid purchase. Holds all my keys, and each has a tag. My only minor complaint is that the key used to open the door has a very small opening for my key chain and doesn't slip easily around the ring. I do recommend this product."
3,Off Balance,"This key cabinet is ok at doing what it's supposed to do (keep the keys safe), but when it's hung on a wall and opened, the whole thing tilts. I guess perhaps the weight of the front door is too much?"
3,Make me smile and jerk a tear..,"I read somewhere that this version was based more on the ""original"" storyline. I got to say this ending was a good.The conflicts between Parn and Ashram was resolved in a way fitting for these two characters (although I have to say Ashram came out my FAVORITE). It did clear up a bit of confusion as far as Garek was concerned.What a touching scene with him and Rhyniah(oops!I spelled it wrong) Spark finally getting what he wants sooo badly. And the bad guy getting what he deserves..By this stage in the series, you probably gotten over the ""less than stunning"" graphics and cared more about the storyline. I gotta say it was pretty good.Having both the OVA and this series I give props to this one for character development. HOWEVER, the ova was more visually captivating.All in all I liked it and think it worth the money. Especially the"" second parts"", the last one had me rolling..hahah..=)"
3,Cooking with Three Ingredients,I purchased this book for my grandson who is going to college and is not a chef.ha I thought this would simplify things for him. I have reviewed it and it seems to have some he would eat.
1,on line purchase,The sunnto viper add said it was 0-100% o2 compattible sunnto site said 0-50% so this was a descrepancy I found buyingWell I ordered 2 and did not get a working unit they did give a refund but what a pain had to wait for them to comfirm they recieved the order back and they were out of stock for a replacement this is the second time I have posted more than 20 words but I am sure a negative post is the reason they bounced the first review.
3,gloves,"A little expensive. After I had already made the purchase, found them at local store for less."
2,gloves review,"theese gloves are more for womens size, if your a guy they will be tite around the rise and hand. Im man and they dont bearly fit. they do state there adult size. the seller emailed me back rite away. very good polite. dont for get men u may not like tite gloves. they are knit multi collors to pick from as the same product. tho they all dident feel like they where the same product. some feel looser then others. if there ganna be adult they should fit adult. tho it dosent state weather it is for men or women it simply dosent say the size tho there adult. they could have a lot more to that. more for kids a ladys because there smaller then guys. good luck in your order for the rite size"
3,Good watch for those who like it,"The watch is good. It has white leather band, but the website does not have a picture of the entire watch. The other half of the band is metal, which we did not want. Anyway, it is a good item overall. I bought it for my wife since she wanted something in white leather, but returned it as the band was part metal."
3,"Beginning of the mature Sabatini; skip the first half, and ignore the Errol Flynn film","Sabatini's long literary nonage ends abruptly after Part I of The Sea-Hawk, which you can safely skip if you find any of it dragging; it's domestic melodrama, similar to much of what he'd already written, and what you need to know is recapitulated in Part II. His mature period begins suddenly with Part II, which is an awkward and abrupt transition from Part I; but once Sabatini hits his stride, the writing is nearly as gripping as anything in his prime. The climax works well and makes a reasonable amount of sense, though Sabatini does revert to some earlier bad habits in the anti-climaxes, which are unduly burdened by coincidence--enough so that a character even needs to allude to them.Despite what Amazon claims, the Errol Flynn movie (which I walked out of) was not based on the novel. The silent film, however, was; and what I saw of it was quite well done."
4,I enjoyed this book,"I particularly liked the feel of this book. If felt like it could have been written when the book took place. I also liked how some plot was nicely summarized rather than drawn out into what could have been many chapters, making a concise complete story. One problem I had was with the action in the book. This is supposed to an adventure but many of the fight/action scenes are scantily described. There was a bit of a lack of character development, but by the end the important players were fleshed out well enough. I thought the psychoanalysis of the characters was good as well, not being overdone as in some books, but there enough to lend some insight into decisions that characters made. Overall this was an enjoyable read."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad product, not the best either. The Ed Miller videos do a much better job, however for the price I can't complain.The play by play explanation of how Mike and Todd analyze each hand is excellent. This really gets you into the mind of how a professional thinks. This is opened up my mind and also pointed out some leaks i have in my game."
2,Fun But Terribly Sad,As a former nun who lived in a community that forbad the physical discipline of children I was overwhelmed by the continuous flow of stories that bordered on abuse. I went to a Catholic School in the 40ies and was slapped and hit with rulers and it changed me and only now do i realize that though we almost bragged about what was happening it was so sad and scary and life changing to live in that atmosphere. And even though we never abused a child our kids in the 60ies made up stories to tell each other that were not true. Did you verify that each person actually saw the incident or were they told about it. I know that most of your book is true.
4,Don't be fooled by the two different video covers,"Eating Out is a sex farce, in the grand tradition of same. Think American Pie, Porkies or any John Hughes film. That was the intention of the filmmakers.One review has mentioned that there are two different versions of the film available. Not quite true. There are two different covers on the DVD, one of which is a lot less ""gay."" The content of the film is identical however. The original cover was deemed too racy by some retailers, so a new one was designed for those outlets. So don't worry about hunting around for one cover or the other - the DVD content itself has not been editied for the ""tamer"" cover."
3,Hot boys Bad Movie,"This is another one of those gay movies that has a bad script, and bad acting.....but hot boys, in this case two of them go full frontal. I saw this in the movies last week where it is playing at the Quad in NYC. It is an ok movie, I wouldnt say dont see it.....but watch it for the boys nudity! Thats really its only redeeming quality"
2,Gay Cinema...,"I have to agree with one of the previous reviews. It just seems like there aren't a lot of decent gay movies - they all just seem like a 90 minute excuse to see a couple of naked guys for a little bit. EATING OUT is the perfect example of the lowest common denominator: poor in every way except for the cute guys. If you want to see good/interesting, explicity gay-themed indies then check out SUGAR, NEVERLAND (the gay-themed PETER PAN - not the Johnny Depp movie!), TRICK - even LATTER DAYS, which had some talent and creativity behind it. EATING OUT is another really bad, over-hyped mess."
1,what happened with gay america?,"this film is for straight audiences.i bought eating out and i don't suggest because it's not a gay movie to gay audiences.GAY BRAZIL films like cazuza,madame sata and the second story of possible loves are very best.brazilian gays ask me: what happened with gay america ? films like eating out aren't gay movies.i lost my money"
5,Eating Out (2004),"All right, sometime I wonder why a movie gets so much attention... and maybe this one did since it has one really cure character, Mark, but sincerely I don't get what else. The plot could be interesting, but I really don't get the appeal of Caleb, for me he is not so handsome or clever or interesting. It would be more interesting to see the development of the relationship between Mark and Kyle instead. And then to my eyes I don't see what they all find in Gwen, maybe she is a pretty girl, but when she acts as she does, I would be glad to knock dead her in the head."
3,"An ""In-the-Mood-Comedy""","""Eating Out"" is amusing without being genuinely witty. If you accept it as a piece of cotton candy with sex added you might bave a good time with it. Just think of it like eating a tasty dessert with no nutritional value. In light of the next two sequels (Sloppy Seconds and All You Can Eat) this first film seems like a experimental trial run. The ideas are sort of interesting, but so bizarre and fanciful that it's played like a cartoon, or vaudeville sketch. The acting is broad but spirited. Some of the scenes are so shrill they verge on embarrasing, but still manage to be entertaining. The guys are great to look at, but the ""Mainstream"" version (cover art of two guys facing the viewer) edits out the full frontal scenes, so beware."
4,Interest Movie,"I liked the movie, it was a crazy love story with a threesome concept. Hot scene with the two guys on the couch and the girl on the phone!"
1,Really Bad,"Badly written, badly acted. Entire sequences don't make any sense (i.e., dinner table scene). Complete and utter waste of time.Shockingly bad. Why in the world was this movie even made?"
2,More like 2.5 stars,"This is one of those gay movies that tries REALLY hard to be current, packing in as many pop culture references as possible. Too bad, it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is.That being said, there is a hotness factor with the two male leads, and the movie ends with everybody happy in that cliche romantic comedy sorta way."
1,nothing but an insult,"ok, the twinks are cute, but other than that this travesty of a ""gay"" flick is an absolute insult to the viewers, to any self-respecting gay individual & most of all it bears the worst, condescending & misogynic caricature of a female character i've ever seen on film. all shame, no pride. save your bucks & time."
2,Eating out,"Eating out was a pleasant DVD experience, perfect for a lazy weekend night. If you're looking for deep insights, profound messages, succulent scriptwriting, not to mention dramatic visual effects or a multiplex experience, you should go elsewhere. But if you are looking for some light camp banter, cute guys and a simple storyline, look no further. Not every gay movie can be a Brokeback Mountain after all."
1,UUgghhh,"Yet another ""Starts off lame, bad acting, tired script"" gay movie. Doesn't any one out there in the community have talent anymore? Anyone?...sigh.This movie lasted all of... wait for it... twenty minutes and then, Click goes the Off button. There were six of us over that evening for our pizza, wine and movie night. The normal ""OO LA LA's"" for the cute boys on the screen died off ""quick"". There's almost nothing worse than sober bitchy-queens with an itch for a good gay movie. So, we ended up watching Boy Culture, again (at least two of the group hadn't seen Boy Culture yet so we were good there).Seriously though, if we wanted to watch bad acting gay males, then there blessed well should have been full triple-X action involved. Oh well. NEXT!!!!"
5,Every gay man has a female best-friend,"This movie is GREAT! It really captured the essence of the relationship between a gay man and his female best friend. What they would do for each other, to help one another. It doesn't hurt that the leading men are HOT!! Great scenes!"
4,Pre-Judgement,"Well, from all the reviews I've read of this film already, despite the fact it hasn't been brought out yet, and I haven't seen it, it's gonna be pretty good, certainly.An indie comedy, it sees the exploits of a man, pretending to be gay so that he can hook up with a girl who enjoys pursuing gay men (for some reason). However, there are multiple plot twists and apparently a slightly unexpected ending. But the main reason I give this film four stars is that it has Ryan Carnes in, who has recently been seen as 'Justin' in Desperate Housewives. In this film he is playing a(nother) gay guy, technically his first role, but everyone's seen him in DH now, so I guess it might not count. Whatever. He's hot. Full stop."
1,Illiterate Script,"This could have been a good film. It's spoiled by two things: a barely literate script which scarcely gets beyond four-lettered words, and a female lead with a voice like a pencil on slate. She sounds like Lena Lamont from ""Singing in the Rain""."
1,"What can I say but ,""what was this director thinking?""","Wow...I just saw this on netflix and immediately cancelled my ""next in queu"" Eating Out Sloppy Seconds...It was so poorly written and the line readings were ridiculous. Scott Lunsford was not even remotely convincing as straight and his ""girlfriend"" at the opener was laughable. She was a cow.Sorry, don't waste your time or energy..."
4,"Sweet, funny, sharp","Yes, I know there's over-acting and under-acting here, and the camera work could have been more professional, and nobody who's a musician in this film seems at all musical. However, I thought it was an adorable little farce with some great lines and like all farces, some profundities underneath the surface. This film explores the mysteries of desire in a unique way--I don't want to reveal it, but there's a take on phone sex unlike anything I've ever seen. The director scores bigtime for that. As for people saying the acting is ""pedantic""--I assume pedestrian was the word sought for? And someone being stuck in 1982? Hel-lo, plenty of people have their own weird nostalgia trips. Nothing unbelievable there."
2,Don't !!,"Please, if you like your money and time, don't waste it. Poor acting. Poor plot. Poor dialogue. What's that scene with the parents,!!! awfully painful. The overacting of the girl friend may mean to be funny, but it fails. Not to mention her attitude as a friend. The only worthy scene would be the threesome thru the phone. The two guys have gorgeous pecs and toys, but please. Rent it if you want. And then, if for some weird reason you like the movie, okay, go for it. Hey, silly movies are okay for entertainment, but this one! I should've believed the really bad reviews."
2,Few redeeming factors,"There are funny moments. There are dull moments. There are bad moments. There are far to many bad moments. Overall this movie is really bad, but I can't say that it's not acted well. I enjoyed the acting, but the writing was terrible. My partner and I decided to give it a try, and were both so sorry we had. I busied myself doing some housework while it played out. The best part(s!): Ryan naked.(Un?)Fortunately, there's a sequel that he's not a part of."
1,Eating Out...would make anyone want to stay in....,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was like watching a really bad episode of MTVs UNDRESSED but with less talent. The storyline made me yawn and the actors were lame.
1,Sony VHS,"I would not recommend this low quality product, the picture quality suck so bad, I can't view it after few months. Stay away!"
5,Been using for years,"I have used these for several years for my daughter's school uniforms. I still have one from three years ago that is attached. As she outgrows the uniform I just pull out the label then someone else can use the uniform (we have a uniform exchange set up at our school). Just make sure you iron it at least twice as long as they say to and you should be fine. I have only had to re-iron one label in the 20+ I have used over the years.I don't use the marker that came with these labels (another way to buy these), I use the Sharpie Rub a Dub. Don't remember if the marker didn't work or because I already had the Rub a Dub's."
5,Excellent introduction to the subject,"Berry's book is definately one of the more accessible yet rigourous treatments of this fascinating subject.It assumes a sound knowledge of Special Relativity and a good command of Calculus, Differential Equations and Vector Algebra, but without the onerous use of tensors and as such it is a serious book for the Physics student rather than a popular presentation of science.All of the fundamentals are covered here: an outline of cosmography, distance and velocity measurements, the rationale for General Relativity based on a critical assessment of the shortcomings of both the Newtonian model and Special Relativity, the Principle of Equivalence, Curved Space-time, geodesics, Gravitational Waves, Black holes, and Cosmic models.The author makes excellent use of diagrams and the discussion of the physical principles is balanced by a careful presentation of the mathematics.A highly recommended book!"
5,Great value,"It's red, it's 50ft long, it works perfectly and it costs 25% of average store price.What else could you ask for ?"
2,Not worth the money,"I wanted an alternative to mascara. This product is messy, diffucult to apply, and you have to use a q-tip and the oil they provide to remove it from you skin. Also, it was supposed to last a few days - my thinking was that I would actually wake up with eyelashes. But that was not the case - gone by the next morning."
5,Cute,Cute garden flag for a Dane owner. The fabric withstands the windy winter here in Pennsylvania. Vibrant colors that looks great.
3,well . . . not NO salt,"many of the recipes have ""use low sodium chicken broth"" - geez, that's what i need to know how to find a no- salt alternative of - i figured out most other no salt solutions already.however, excellent recipes for those of you do not need to keep your sodium under 1g a day and still eat large portions."
5,Christmas gift,I bought this cookbook for a Christmas present for my friend. It was in pristine condition when it arrived and she seemed happy with it.
1,The No-Salt Cookbook,I do not care for the recipes in this book. Most foods are not the types of meals my family is used to eating. They should but they won't.There are some very good dessert recipes in the Desserts section but most desserts have very little sodium anyway so a regular cookbook could be used by omitting salt from cookies and cakes. You probably would not know it was missing.
5,You'll never miss the salt!,"If you are searching for a cookbook that will allow you to prepare succulent meals with a very low sodium content, The No-Salt Cookbook is a superlative place to start. All the taste is there, with absolutely none of the guilt.Giving up salt is not easy to do, but once you start removing it from your diet you will find an almost immediate change in the way you feel. These recipes will allow you to prepare meals that the entire family will enjoy, and never notice that the salt is gone. We've only enjoyed a few of the meals here, but look forward to enjoying just about all of them. The ingredients are readily available in your supermarket."
4,Many different options,My mom has been on a no salt diet for about a year now and we are always looking for new recipes. I bought her this book for Christmas and she really enjoys it.
2,Few recipes without acidity in it,"I only found four recipes that I could try. Most had acidity added to it, I guess to make up for the salt, but I can't have."
3,No Calorie Count,"There are lots of good recipes in this book, but it only lists the sodium content and not the calorie count for each serving. The other three no-salt or low-salt cookbooks I ordered at the same time have both sodium and calorie counts, which is a big help."
4,how can you not like this?,even just listening to the clips i'd give it four satrs. im sure that number would increase onec i bought it. but to each his own
2,Too Dreary,I agree with the Amazon review that they have created an atmospheric album - it's just that the atmosphere is a bit too gloomy and all the songs sound kind of the same. I live in a place with a pretty dreary climate - maybe I just need something a little sunnier.
5,an outstanding 2006 release!,"anybody out there familiar with the music of robert wyatt? well this digs into a similar vein of spirit. great melodies with lots going on: xylophones, lap steel, glockenspiel, autoharp, keyboards, guitars, banjo, clarinet, flute, saxophone, bass, drums & touches of electonics, all have a say in the matter. tasteful and mostly dreamy, a feast to listen to over and over. it gets richer, in fact, with each listen. great stuff."
5,Your fall playlist,"I've been following Grizzly Bear for a year and a half. A friend introduced me to Horn of Plenty, their first album, when it first came out and when the band was still rather obscure and the sound sparse, a product of leadsinger Edward Droste's improvised bedroom set up -- a fact you'll be quick to learn in every other of the seemingly endless features on them right now. Horn of Plenty was a really beautiful, unexpected album but with Yellow House, Grizzly Bear has entered a different realm of finesse and theis record is undoubteldy one of the finest of the year. There are lush arrangements, intricate harmonies, and an incredible suite of songs that move in surprising directions. Yellow House may still take a few listens to fully grow on you (although the Knife is an instant classis), but listen to it twice on the way to work on a gray fall day and you'll never stop."
5,best album in a decade,"I both envy and feel sad for anyone who has not heard this album. I envy you because when you first listen to this album it will awaken beauty in your life and I feel sad that you have yet to expierence it yet. I haven't fallen for an album like this since flaming lips, yoshimi. you can sure find influences in thier music, I hear beatles and beach boys but there is also a very distinct quality, untapped in modern music, I can't place it, but it is haunting and this album stays with you for a long time. I work nights in badgad, its the soundtrack of my deployment and brings beauty to a horrid situation. thank you grizzly bear. its exilirating to say the least. Easily the best album of the year and in my top 5 of the decade so far."
2,Don't like it...,Headband is a little too large and no way to compensate for that. Also stretches out a lot from one use and doesn't shrink back up after washing and drying. Not worth the time and money to return.
1,cross the dadu river,"This was the 3rd time I've ordered this product. Each time the listing shows that it will play in ""all regions"". It will not play due to ""area limitations"". This time I had sent you an email asking if it will certainly play. You answered me on 10-23-10 and you stated that, ""Yes, it will play in the United States"". If you had answered me honestly, I would not have wasted my money on it for the 3rd time."
3,A typical Meth CD,"I dont know why is seems that Meth by himself just dont sound right, but on another artist's Cd he tears it up. This one is no differant"
4,4:21 ALBUM,"I LIKED THE OVERALL FEEL OF THIS ALBUM. IT HAS THAT OLD MEF STYLE-BRING DA PAIN-GETTO GRIME-DO YOU DIRTY, AND LAUGH AT YOU- STYLE. ITS CLASSIC. I THINK MEF SOUNDED OLD AND BURNT OUT A BIT. I WOULD LIKE TO HERE MEF RAISE HIS VOICE MORE. THE COLLABO'S WERE ALL GOOD ONES.IT HAS A GOOD POSITIVE FLOW THAT YOU CAN LISTEN STRAIGHT THROUGH EACH SONG WITH OUT HAVING TO SKIP 15 SONGS AND JUST HAVE 1 OR 2 THAT YOU PUT ON REPEAT.IF YOU'VE READ MY OTHER REVIEWS, I DON'T COMMENT ABOUT LYRICS. I RESPECT INDIVIDUALITY. IF AN ARTIST SUCKS PERIOD, I WON'T REVIEW IT."
2,Black-Out part 2,"2 hot tracks 4:20 and Presidential MC's. The rest sounds like Blackout reject tracks. Here's one of the lines off this album. ""I got terrorists shook, cause I'm da bomb"" Barney has better flow than that. I own every single album even affliated with Wu-tang so please please diregard those other reviews and trust me when I tell you this album is lame."
4,Props METHOD,"Thank you for comin out wit something that can have the name method man on it and not be wack. This his 3rd album, as Tical 0 asid from what's happinin and the prelude was so wack it couldn't even have been as bad as G-Unit album. This is definitly not as good as Tical 2000, an album that most ignorantly is slept on as being a perfectly good sophmore release and one of my favority albums. Of course this album ain't not Tical, as that is one of hip-hop all time masterpieces. Meth, holla at RZA and lock him in the office so he can come up with a whole album for you. THen you listen to Tical over and over again a remeber how you was flowin. Then make Tical part 2."
2,What Happened to Method Man?,"It's about time someone heard the same album as me. Listen to M Sagna and save your money. Method man used to be one of my favorite rappers, but this album has some boring beats, and Meth seems like hes rapping in slow motion. Dont get me wrong I love Method Man but this album wasnt what I was expecting. It might be better than the prequel but what isnt. So far the only songs I like are the Intro, walk on and ya meeen. First Busta calmes down, then Method and Ludacris. Well I guess money talks and everybodys gotta grow up sometimes."
5,Meth Baby!!!!!!!!,"I WROTE A HUUUUUUGE REVIEW ON THIS ALBUM RITE NOW,THEN I ERASED IT, CAUSE U KNOE WAT ,F*K ALL THAT, THE ALBUM SPEAKS 4 ITSELF,N U GUYS DONT WANNA READ ALL THAT STUFF ANYWAY,JUS GET THIS ALBUM, ITS VERY VERY GOOD, IM NOT EVEN THAT MUCH IN2 RAP ANYMORE CAUSE IT SUX NOW, BUT THIS ALBUM IS GR8. I ONLY DO REVIEWS WHEN AN ALBUM IS 5 STARS N THIS 1 IS DEFINITELY DESERVING THE 5."
4,4:21 and my blunts burning,"Lets keep it real....the M.E.T.H.O.D MAN had a bad last round with ""tical 0""...I was hesitant in picking this album up...I assumed the Mef Man had lost his fire....but a friend of mine had a copy of this album sometime before it hit stores.I listened to it and was impressed with how hungry Method Man sounded...pick it up.........it gets four stars because two songs should not be on here..I wont say what two..but its still good"
4,Music for the mature listener.,I bought Ganado Red without listening to any of the tracks available at Jay Hirsh's site. It was well worth the investment and I have enjoyed listening to it many times. In a class all of its own you can hear a folk-jazz influence. Of course there are times when I hear portions of the great sounds Jay wrote when he was with Mr Flood's Party that recorded a first rate rock album in 1969. This collection of songs demonstrates the maturity that Jay Hirsh has developed over the years. It makes for a pleasurable listen. All the instruments are played by Jay except for some guest guitar work. Let's hope there is more to come !
1,Cheap plastic,"This product is very cheap plastic, funny it says rust resistant, must not mean the propeller. Even funnier it has a lock, for what?"
5,good product.,"i tride it and gave it to my brother relly good resalts,im very satisfid with the product and i will recomend it to others"
3,The Pill,Great rainy Saturday or late night movie. I could see this scenerio played out in so many lives. I would rent this again.
4,Really liked it!,"Seriously, I downloaded this movie to watch on the plane and really had no expectations but I thought it was wonderful! I loved the characters - they did such a great job. Loved, loved the girl (Rachel Boston) - never heard of her but will look for her again! And the guy was like a mini Tom Cruise and then Anna C. from My Girl was gorgeous! I thought the premise was great, the characters were all likeable and believeable and I would recommend it to anyone who can relate to this type of situation. Loved it!"
1,The PILL,"No what I expected, very slow and not interesting. absolutely no point. unreal and at some point stupid.Boring and expensive for this type of movie....."
2,"Wow, personality disorders abundant...","Despite the trailer that was inviting, this movie has two main characters that are extremely dysfunctional. First, the main female character is borderline pathological. She straight up FREAKS me out. Furthermore, the main guy character is a push over with no cajones. Honestly, it was rather painful to watch, but since I paid 3.99 I figured I'd skip along till the end. Boy did waste 4 dollars. I would have asked Redbox for my 1 dollar back if I rented it there. Do yourself a favor, if you're a sane man, don't waste your time and money. If you're a female that may like the twilight saga, mixed with the morning after pill, and some 30 somethings, sure...you may like this."
2,Noah Bean ruins this movie,"The concept of the movie is actually pretty good, though the story needed some work.Where this movie completely fails is the casting of Noah Bean, his performance is monotone and he seems bored. Had he been in a supporting role with 5 mins of screen time it would have not mattered.Boston was just the opposite, great casting and she delivered in this movie.Just irritates me when a movie had potential but a major blunder in casting or the story really kill it. Here is was casting."
5,In the Springtime of the Year by Susan Hill,"An absolutely brilliant novel. Touching, sad, hopeful. It shares with the reader the deep feelings of loss and grief but also love and eventual peace. Poetical prose! Highly recommended."
1,Rockin' bugs away!,My friend was happy and it installed very easily! The vent shades were another story! No instructions or pamphlet or anything with these items....all online and not very helpful.Bug deflector - very Niiice!
3,My first Nightwish CD,"I can't remember how I stumbled upon this group, but I liked the sample enough to give it a try. Having never heard them before, my reaction/opinion is strictly without any preconceived idea of how it should sound. Saying that, I really like the instrumental or orchestral part. I have to say the vocals are just a little too drama oriented for me. I picture characters from the World Wrestling Alliance in love! So personally, I like the music but kind of wish they'd shut up so I could take it more seriously."
5,Nightwish Can Do No Wrong,"I'm not usually that crazy about buying albums that are mostly live stuff, but for the second time with Nightwish I've done it and not been disappointed. I figured if nothing else, the first four songs which are the studio cuts and can't be found anywhere else would be worth it alone, but even the live songs are great too. The only thing I could live without would be the weird growling spoken parts on ""10th Man Down"", an otherwise excellent song (thank God they don't use that technique anymore now that they have a really good male vocalist). Also, as an added bonus, if you happen to be a Sonata Arctica fan, like I am, Tony Kakko joins the band on three of the songs. All I can say is, your Nightwish collection is not complete without this CD!"
1,The reason I dont buy Panasonic anymore.,"This TV was the worst purchase I made in my life. Ive been through 3 lamps and am having problems again. I let my wife talk me into spending 150 for a lamp instead of buying a new TV. Huge mistake. This TV has caused me embarassment, frustration and hopelessness. Panasonic should have taken care of their customers when they bought this lemon. There was a class action lawsuit but unfortunately I missed the boat. Regardless I will not buy a Panasonic again, not because they are not usually a good product but because of how the company handled this situation, which was caveat emptor at its worst."
2,Bulb Issues Here as Well,"When it works, it is great. The picture is amazing, it is relatively user friendly and I love the Split Screen feature. However.....we bought the TV in Sept. 2003 and the first bulb blew in Aug. 2004. With considerable effort on our part, Panasonic finally replaced the bulb at no cost. Bulb blew again in Sept. 2005. We missed the one year warranty by about six weeks so we had to pay $300 for a new bulb. We did call the Customer Service department when the second bulb blew and they admitted the bulbs were ""defective"" and that that bulb life of 10,000 hours is misrepresented, though they obviously didn't feel inclined to replace our second bulb again at no cost. This will be the last Panasonic item we purchase."
1,"NEVER again, Panasonic!","We bought this TV in June of 2004 as an employee purchase. We are now on our THIRD repair for a blown bulb/lamp. We've also replaced the ballast. Panasonic refuses to accept this set is defective and will not accept it as a return. Because this started occurring during the orig 1 yr warranty, the bulbs are so far still covered. If not, we'd already be out $1000 in bulbs after today. I don't even know what the ballast cost to replace. The bulbs seem to last about 4 months, then almost like clockwork - DEAD. No pic, no nothing. I don't even want to sell this TV because I'll feel horrible for the next person having to shell out so much for the bulbs."
1,would give it negative stars if i could,this tv is the worst purchase i have ever made. the bulbs go out every few months and need to be replaced. huge hassle. would like my money back and a new different tv.
1,Modern day money pit.,"This is the perfect television for the person who has too much money and a second television. Having had mine for almost 4 years now, I have replaced the lamp three times and am now having to replace the ""ballast"". If you pay full retail, that would be an additional $1400.00 in parts and service. Fortunately, some people are selling the lamps (without the housings) and ballast kits at way below repair shop prices. Even at that, this was a television which should have had a formal recall from Panasonic a long time ago. I guess sometimes technology doesn't make life easier (at least not based on my blood pressure). Consider another television...any other television."
2,OK product....HORRIBLE LAMP LIFE!!!,"The life of the lamp on this model is rated at 10,000 hours. We've owned this TV for ~3.5 years and have had to replace the lamp twice...at $285 each pop. WOW! I know what you're thinking...well, maybe they just watch a lot of TV. Not true. Even if we did watch for 6 hours per day, 365 days per year, a single lamp should still last about 4.5 years. We actually probably max out at about 2 hours per day roughly 4 days per week, which means we shouldn't have had to replace the first lamp until after ~24 years or so. Do yourself a favor...buy another product.Aside from the unacceptable lamp life, HD quality output was very good. Analog output was not nearly as good as other HDTVs that I have seen."
1,Great..........when it works!!!!!!,"TV repair shop just picked up my set. Waited two weeks for action from Panasonic. Waited one more from repair shop to schedule pick up. What can I say about this set? I can't say what I want to!!! 3 blown projection lamps in 1.5 years. Panasonic would not send me another lamp (nor would I allow then to) until the ballast board is replaced. Yes, I did take the extended warranty, but the down time for this set has been excessive and irritating. It will be in the repair shop for at least another week. All parts have to be authorized by Panasonic or Circuit City, and then shipped. Probably third class mail!! If a new ballast board does not fix the problem, I have a boat that needs an anchor."
1,Please tell me they're not still making this nightmare.,"This machine, when it works, is fine. The problem is, it breaks down as hobby. The lamps burn out well before their stated life, and in my case, so did the image engine -- twice. And the ballast. I was unable to get a replacement as a class action remedy because my warranty company, City Advantage, gave me no receipts for their many repairs. Run away from this television. Panasonic dropped the ball with this one."
1,Don't ever buy this Model,We bought PT-50LC13 from Best Buy on Aug 2003. Thank Almighty we bought the extended Service Plan and their service has been excellent. The bulb blew up thrice in 2 years and the light engine (whatever it is) went dead one time. Will not by any Panasonic product after reading the reviews from other customers. No wonder they were forced to take this product off the market. This product gets a -ve star.
4,This Game is so Fun!,This game is for girls only.It lets you yes you be yourself.You can have quizzes that only girls can answer.You even can to do magic.Trust me this game is AWSOME!That is the fun in girls!
2,Larger than expected; broke within 2 months,"I was hoping to replace the Petmate fountain our cats currently drink from, which as many people have noted, gets dirty fast and needs to be painstakingly cleaned by hand. But this bubbler was quite a bit different, and the cats didn't take to it. It's very large, more like you would expect for a dog water dispenser; we couldn't fit it on a kitchen counter like we had hoped, so it had to stay in the laundry room. Then I took it apart to run it through the dishwasher, and broke the hard plastic tube the air comes through. The break was right under the valve that dispenses water, so it wouldn't close properly and water overflowed. That's right, I managed to break the one part in just such a way to make the whole thing useless."
1,Cat did not use. Leaked.,"Cat never drank out of it, and it leaked through the bottom onto my carpet. Trying a ""real"" cat fountain, one that actually pours the water like a sink. Could have just been a bad unit, but I would not bother."
4,Petmate Ulltra Bubbler Watering System,"If I had a choice to buy this again or not, I definitely would . But I am disappointed because my cats are afraid of it if the pump is turned on. I use it without the pump, they are okay with that. If I had known the ""bubbles"" would scare them, I would have bought something designed like this without the ""bubbles"". So the idea behind the water dispenser is great, without the bubbling."
4,"Relatively quiet, seems to work well","It's not the most attractive pet fountain out there, but it works well enough. The first one that was delivered had a poorly molded plastic piece on the underside that leaked. However, I exchanged it and the new one works fine. It's not loud, just a soft bubbling in the background like any indoor fountain. I'm not sure if my cat will like it or not, but I felt like it was worth a shot. It seemed like a good price to try out a pet fountain."
2,Bubbles pop in cat's face,"I decided to buy this because it didn't use a filter. I use filtered water, so I didn't need the additional filter in the machine. Also, I used a Drinkwell in the past, and the water had tiny black flecks floating in it from the filter. I got this set up pretty easily, but saw right away that it bubbled too much. My cats would not go near it. There is soposed to be a knob at the back that turns the bubbles down, but mine would not turn. I finally tied a loose knot in the hose and it turned the bubbles down. However, whenever one of my cats tried to drink out of it, the bubbles popped in her face. So far none of my three cats have taken a drink from it. I'm returning it and using the Drinkwell without the filter, at least they were not afraid of it."
2,Way too loud,"The pump was so loud, that I couldn't use it. And, it doesn't hold much water, I like LeBistro much better - even if it doesn't have water movement. This unit was just not user friendly, since my cats were scared of the noise it put off. Live and learn."
1,Leaked!,"I just received the Petmate Ultra Bubbler Watering System today. I put it together, filled it with water, set it down on the floor and watched it leak water all over! There's a hole in the bottom. I'm sending it back!"
2,Gets dirty fast,I have 7 dogs. I thought this would keep their water fresher longer -- it doesn't. The tubing gets gross looking and the plastic container doesn't hold very much water. Not recommeded.
3,Great if my cats would drink from it,"After much research, I purchased the Ultra Bubbler since it didn't have filters to change. The item works as described, but for some reason my cats refused to drink from it. Maybe it is too loud? (It sounds like an aquarium pump.) I just cleaned it really well again and I'm going to give it another try."
3,JUST DIDN'T CUT IT,"I thought my cats would go crazy over this fountain. They didn't. They didn't even drink out of it one time. I returned it. I don't think there is anything wrong with the product, just not to my cats' liking.Amazon.com is far and away the best place to shop. They are all about customer service and I have never ever had a problem with returning anything."
4,Bubbler,"It definately bubbles! My animals took about a week to get used to it but they enjoy it now. The nozel to adjust bubble flow didn't work just as past reviews stated and it is a bit noisy. Otherwise I am happy with the amount of water it holds, how it keeps the water fresh and it's ease of use."
2,I didn't like it; cat didn't like it.,"This is a great idea, but I think it might need more tweaking. The reservoir holds a lot of water, which is good, but there is no filter. So any cat hair, stray food, or whatever your 18-month-old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl. Then it sits there, usually after sinking to the bottom, until you dig it out. Also, with mine at least, you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear. A shame, since the cat really did like the few bubbles I was able to coax out.If this somehow filtered the water AND made bubbles, I'd be all over it (like cat hair on a pastel couch)."
4,Petmate Ultra bubbler,"I was very skeptical that my cat would actually use this bubbler since he is an outdoor cat and not normally amused by cat toys, etc. He is extremely cautious which has been demonstrated by living to 15 years old in a coyote neighborhood. After a day or too, however, he did consent to use the bubbler, but only on the lowest bubble setting. If he will use it, I expect most cats would. The bubbler was simple to set up and to is easy to clean and refill. So all is good."
4,"Works as promised, however","Easy to set up, and worked as promised (although the bubble adjustor didn't change the bubbles at all), however, my cats were totally uninterested and never would drink out of it. They did not appeared to be scared, just disinterested. For that reason, I returned it."
1,"Did not work properly, sent back next day","Easy set up but it just did not work for me. Tried to get it to pump, but no luck. I can't comment further on features since I didn't get very far with product. I have since purchased something else."
4,Best water source for cats,"My cats love this watering system and the large reservoir means I only need to refill it every two weeks or so. If only it were stainless steel instead of plastic! The plastic that isn't constantly under water gets rough and attracts dust that just doesn't come off. For the price, replacing it is not a big deal, and I get years of use before that is imperative."
2,Ok but not great,"Residue built up in the air tubes and its impossible to clean. I never noticed my cats really giving a damn about the bubbles, they drank with the same pattern. Anyway, I broke it when trying to clean it, as its operation had dwindled, and now I'm back to regular bowls."
2,Easy to set up but hard to clean,"I've had this for several months and the cats loved it at first. They would sit right in front of it and watch the water bubbling for minutes before playing with their paws, then they would drink from it. But the tubes crack very easily during cleaning and it's hard to clean the gunk that'll build up inside the glass tubes. In fact, the first unit came with already cracked tubes. I had to return it and was promptly sent another replacement. But as mentioned earlier, the tubes of my second unit cracked while I was disassembling the unit for cleaning. So I'm now running the unit with broken tubes. It still works fine, but the the gunk will still build up pretty quickly in the tubes, and the cats would refrain from drinking from it. I don't mind cleaning it weekly, but it is almost impossible to reach inside the tubes to thoroughly clean it. I'm considering buying a drinkwell fountain instead."
3,SO NOISY! cant adjust bubbling!,"This thing is NOISY its as noticeable as a cheap dishwasher running in a room! Im going to keep it though, I assume I will get used to the constant humming sound of the motor as well as bubbling sound of the water. My cats have just been staring at it so Im not sure if they will use it or not. It says you can control the bubble amount but the knob only turns a tiny bit and I cant tell a difference in the amount of bubbles coming out. It is a nice alternative to buying a filter guzzling waterer."
3,This pet fountain works....but....,"the noise from the bubbler scares my cats. They won't use it when the fountain is turned on. I have to admit the bubbler is somewhat noisey.Other than that, I occasionally turn on the bubbler to help keep the water fresh.If I would have known about the noise, I probably would have just bought a large water dish for my cats."
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"I bought this for my cat with kidney issues, to encourage her to drink more (preferably not from the toilet). It worked -- she did like the fresh bubbling water. But this product is cheap! The plastic wore and discolored within a few months, and the tube that the water runs though started to get brown and grody-looking. Then, about 10 months later, the motor gave up and the whole thing leaked all over my floor. Now kitty is back to a regular bowl.Next time, I'm investing in something nicer, and probably not plastic."
2,wanted to like this but cats got acne from it,"I was really excited about this cat fountain and it would have been perfect with it's huge reservoir and easy clean-up but unfortunately, 2 out of 3 of my cats developed cat acne on their chins from drinking from this fountain. I'm guessing it's the type of plastic as the Drinkwell fountains are definitely made from a different kind. It's real unfortunate as I love this fountain in every other way. I even tried wrapping the rim in aluminum foil to see if it would help but no luck."
2,Too loud,"I bought this at the pet store and returned it the same day after hearing how loud the motor was. My cats ran from it, and I found the motor noise too annoying to have the thing in the same room with me. My cats love bubbling water, so it was the noise that bothered them."
