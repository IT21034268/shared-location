5,A New Life,"This young man has discovered a life without fear through his poetry. His poems will touch your heart and make you realize that to know life is to know joy. His poetry will make you laugh and it will make you cry, but you will become a better person by reading it."
2,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!,I just bought this EXACT toy at Babies R Us for 27.99...its fun and everything but NOT worth any more than 40 bucks! GO TO BABIES!!!
1,Do Not Purchase from Lilly's Items!,Do not purchase this item from Lilly's items. I purchased it for $18 and she cancelled my order and then reposted it for twleve dollars more than I paid for it the very next day. She can't be trusted!
5,Entertains my son,"I wanted to buy a toy that woul keep my son happy/entertained while I changed his diaper in his crib, and I saw this toy and decided to try it. My son really liked kicking it, and would kick like crazy. The sun that lights up always gets his attention. He'd kick the toy and then look at the sun and smile. Now he is 9 months old and still loves it. Now he can walk over and touch the sun, or sit and reach it. It always makes him smile. I think it has cute little songs, and I think he'll enjoy it when he can do the animal noises with it.It has three modes. One makes animal noises with each kick, the second one plays a song or music, and the third plays non-stop for a bit."
2,a bit boring...,"I was hoping for more of an old-fashioned ""busy box"" style toy with lots of fun little things to do. This one simply plays songs and says words - no knobs or anything, just press on an animal, listen and watch a light blink. Perhaps it's my own fault for not looking closely before I ordered it."
4,Enlightening historical fiction,"Mr. McDaniel brings us the personal story of Aindreas Rivers, a poor but remarkable boy of Irish background, set against the backdrop of events leading up to the Bloody Monday riots (probably Louisville's most significant--if infamous-- contribution to American history). Having grown up in Louisville, I found it interesting to read of streets and churches which are still very familiar today, but this knowledge is in no way necessary to enjoyment of the novel. There were many poignant moments in the narrative, made more so to me because my German and Irish ancestors might well have been affected.After recent events in New York and Washington, I found reading this book comforting somehow, that although terrorism has been with us for a long time, even in our own midst, we have been able to come through it and become in many ways a better country."
4,Interesting,"I had vaguely heard a long time ago a tradition or a legend that Jesus of Nazereth had gone to the Far East in between childhood and adulthood. Then I came across this book several months ago. Very insightful, very interesting; it will definitely make you think. Having read this, about the best I can say is, I will not say for 100% that Jesus of Nazereth was there, but there definitely WAS a Jesus there and a lot of the teachings of Jesus do mirror Buddhist and Taoist beliefs to at least a small degree."
3,Thousands of documents exist in India about Jesus 10-12 year stay.,"Enlightened Masters say that Jesus stayed in India 10-12 years. There are THOUSANDS of documents in India and Tibet on Jesus' travels and meditation in the Himalayas. When Westeners shed their prejudices, narrow-mindedness and possessiveness (I am a Westener but I believe the gurus who speak about Jesus), we will seek out and read these documents. There is much more evidence than the journalistic-style writings of Notovich. There are ancient, original sources."
5,Fills in lots of gaps,"I think this is a most fascinating book to read. I often wondered in Bible class what Jesus might have been doing and why it was not recorded in the Bible (at least, what we know of the Bible today). I like how there are varied and different sources that author relies on for her information. The information was believable to me. If you enjoyed it as i did, you may like the follow up book, ""The Lost Teachings of Jesus""."
1,Bogus claims,"There is nothing in Jesus's teachings which would even remotly resamble Eastern teachings. The Talmund and NT recorded several accusations against Jesus made by the xenophobic Pharisees but no surprise - his Far East visit wasn't one of them. There is no historical nor archeological support for this theory. It is based solely on revelations from spirits (pretenting to be Jesus or Mary) received by Elizabeth Prophet, as well as Edgar Cayce. Don't waste your money. Get the New Testament instead."
3,Repetition of other books about Jesus in Kashmir,"Just a repetition and mostly a travelogue and about Satya Sai Baba. Nicholas Notovich's work was repeated by many, many and many more in their own style. The fact remains that Jesus was in India from age 12-29 and came back to his ideal place to live his rest of life after crucifixion, and died at or around the age of 85. Hindus know more about his life than the christians around the world and many books written about his life in India ( in English, Urdu, Hindi, Pali,etc)."
4,It's getting a little better,"Arika has gained admittance to Garderobe Academy, but there are people have it in for her. The incident with the uniform was only the beginning. Maki set a trap for her in swimming class that went terribly wrong, and the Queen also dislikes her. In this volume, the Queen and Arika end up getting in a bit of a bind. The only way for them to survive is to form a contract. Upon sealing their contract, they are able to escape. Since they dislike each other, they keep it a secret and try to find a way to nullify their contract. This DVD has a little more action and character development than the 1st one, but I still don't think this series will live up to the original My Hime."
4,adorable purse/doghouse play set,"this was a surprise gem to me! the set has a ball, dish, bone, and barking dog. I didn't know the dog was going to bark, so that was cool! and, the doghouse has this handle so the little girl I got it for can carry it like a purse! double score!!"
4,Pleasing little Puppy,My one year grandnephew loved this little puppy set and the fact that the puppy looked just like one of my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was not lost on his parents. It's a Gund Baby product which ensured the quality for me.
1,Should have been called Hannibal II - The sequel,"I thought this was a book about Scipio Africanus ? Instead all I get from this book is ""That Hannibal, he was fantastic wasn't he ? Certainly better than this Roman guy who defeated him."" Less time spent on how all Romans were scumbags and more time on Scipio himself, what he actually did and how he went about doing it and this may have been worth reading. I was hoping this book would help contribute to the essay I have to submit on the Second Punic War. After reading this I would suggest Leckie might be better informed by reading my essay. Won't be buying the third book I'm afraid."
1,What a waste,"I have not read Leckie's Hannibal, and based on this book, Scipio, I won't bother. The book wanders aimlessly through the early life of Scipio Africanus in the stereotypical way that novels written as memoirs do. We hear about little Publius growing up, learning Greek, admiring his father from a distance, losing his virginity, and so on. All of this is dealt with in no order and with no urgency, with constant interruptions from Bostar, the clerk recording Scipio's tale. The fact that Bostar was once Hannibal's clerk is an annoying absurdity.Once things do begin to get interesting the book becomes rushed, and everything is hurried and skimmed over with no detail. At least Bostar's interjections end at this point. I understand that, within the story, there are reasons why Scipio must finish his memoir in haste. But that doesn't make for a better read.Rebublican Rome is a fascinating period peopled with fascinating characters. Absolutely none of this comes through in this book. Avoid."
1,"A harmless diversion, but unsatisfying","I am not familiar enough with the history of the Punic Wars or Hannibal and Scipio to pass judgment on the historical accuracy of this book. The most distracting part of Lecke's style is his insistence on cramming so many latin phrases and translations into his text. Do the characters really need to say ""Romanus sum. I am a Roman"" all the time? The author should have spent more time fleshing out his characters than providing a grade-school primer on Latin vocabulary and Roman society. I thought the description of Scipio's first experience of war was entertaining, but Lecke could have been a little more subtle in his portrayal of Scipio's development. How boring to have the future general constanly think or say, ""So, this Hannibal is crafty! Perhaps we Romans can learn from him!"" Ugh."
2,Foot Massager,Very hard to contact the supplier in New Jersey. I was put on Hold for at least 30 minutes and then got disconnected. Shall not deal with this company again. They did not reply to my email either.
5,Due praise for Due North!,"This first album by Bradley Ford and Anna Jordan is a true gift of love for our ears -- and for our hearts. Jordan and Ford are a wonderful duo, each complementing the talent of what their partner does best. Perhaps the most moving aspect of this album for me is the lyrics, which I not only enjoyed with great delight through Anna Jordan's beautiful voice, but also had to read on my own over and over. Don't miss this gem of an album!"
4,good value for a nice watch.,"This seems to be a nice watch. I got it for my wife for Christmas, and the quality seems good so far. The packaging (watch box) from Kenneth Cole was okay. Not super great, but still nice enough to wrap as a gift. For under $100, I doubt you'll find a nicer women's watch.Also, the stainless steel is much shinier (smooth, mirror-like) in person than in the pictures you see here."
1,Disorganized and loosely written,This book is so concentrated on harnessing the knowledge of 17 marketing experts that they forgot to hire an expert writer to make it easy to understand for the student. They talk around many definitions without clearly defining the object of study. Case studies are haphazzardly thrown at the reader and important concepts are vaguely described and with uneccessary complexity. I hope next time they write a book one of their experts is a writer. I feel like I am back in World Literature reading something from the Middle Ages only this time I can't go on the internet for an interpretation.
5,Estrogen finally wins gold!,"I like this book so much I sent emails to a hundred friends to buy it. The main character Dee Dee made me want to stand up and salute the flag. She should have been the one to storm the Twin Towers in NY. Maybe one of the best books I've ever read. Didn't want it to end. The author, a man, somehow got into the head of all women across the world. Yes, we are slighted, but Dee Dee doesn't let it get her down. Go, Girl!"
5,This was wonderful!,"I never write reviews, but The Games deserved something special said about it. It held me captive. When Dee Dee Daniels puts her mind to something, she's hard to hold back! The best female character I can recall in any novel, similar to Erin Brocovich. I think The Games is as good or better than any of John Grisham's. Simply great. All women have to read!"
4,Gold Goes to Schneider,"Yes, gold goes to the author. A man finally gets it right about how women are treated not only in sports, but the world in general...When Russia comes to the Olympic Games to steal the human cloning equation, Dee Dee Daniels puts her foot down to save the day. WE see her struggle with knee problems and self-doubt, but she doesn't cave in. This might be close to the top of my all-time reads. WOMEN WILL LOVE IT. Go, author, go...Schneider is great in this fantastic, gut-wrenching thriller that kept me up all night long!"
4,Good read!,"I loved this story! One, it was about a girl. Two, it made me feel as if I were actually in the story myself. It reminded me of my life and people telling me I couldn't be a swimmer in college. The Games is great!"
1,Tasteless and Odorless? Hrrumph!,"I cannot rate this product since my cat would not drink the water. I followed the directions of water to solution, and even tried diluting it even more so. This product is advertised to be tasteless and odorless, but there is SOMETHING about this additive my kitty turns her nose up at! I'm glad I didn't buy the gallon size!"
1,Better products out there?,"This product did not seem to do anything at all. We have 2 Siberian Huskies and this product did not work as well as another product we were using and could not get. In fairness, the product we were using before has been reformulated and now does not seem to work any better than this one. Our vet said that these products do not work with all animals equally so I would say to purchase the smallest bottle available and just give it a try. If it works for you, this seems to be the most cost effecive brand I coud find online."
5,Absolute Heaven!,I cannot tell you how much I enjoy these recordings. The quality is excellent all the way around! I can't imagine not having this set in my Beethoven collection now that I've heard them.
3,Pleasant experience but mix seems 'compressed'.,"Format: SACDDisclaimer, I am a casual listener of classical music so am not a good source for recommendations based on the finer points of the genre.I listen to this collection of albums in the multichannel SACD format so get to listen to the original quadrophonic mix. The music quality is good and is pleasant to listen to for my untrained ears. I have given it 3 stars as the mix seems 'compressed' or in other words doesn't seem to have the dynamic range that my other SACDs have. This collection wouldn't be one I would use to show case how good SACD can be."
4,"Beats OEM and ""Pull Your Own"" salvage yard prices","I've ordered both remote powered and fixed mirrors from this company. The remote will vibrate little but not to where you can not make what is in view. The fixed models are solid without any vibrations. For the price I'm very pleased, let's face it when your vehicles are 96' and 98' with 150,000 on them you have other areas to spend your money on them. Company ships quick and the products are well packaged."
1,Buyers beware you wont get your product,piece of dog s*** product came openned and with no dvds. never buy this i repeat dont buy this piece of crap. i'd rate a -5 star if i could. thats 5$ down the drain.
5,Nice and short,"Earlimart has never been very mainstream and for that I am grateful. Avenues is a nice collection of 5 songs that all sound great after one and other. If you're into the sound of these guys, pick it up. Interloper and Untitled are signature tracks."
5,Dogs 24/7: Estraordinary Photographs Of Wonderful Dogs,This is a well put together book with great pictures of real dogs - not posed models. What made this book even better was the ability to put a picture of my dog on the cover of the book. It made a great gift for a family member.
4,Torn cover but pretty,"The cover is torn but the pictures are very, very pretty! I hope you like it if you get it."
5,i love the 2 books i received from amazon,the 2 books i received are in great shape..i love the books for gifts for the future to order more...my family loved the pictures & stories...
1,Martha's employee makes a book.,"Following from the previous review where I commented that the projects in this book could have been from 'Martha Stewarts weddings' imagine my amusement when I saw on the back of the book that the Author IS from Martha Stewart's living! Trust me, this book is truly banal."
1,I am returning it,"Wow, I didn't realize Amazon offered Video reviews ! Next time....meanwhile, I am returning this book. Not worth the postage in my opinion. And, from the look of the corners and edges, I may not be the first to have returned this particular book. That alone would have no bearing on whether I liked the book or not, I only mention it as a 'heads up' to others considering ordering it.I consider most of the projects to be very time consuming,AND way out of proportion to the value of the finished piece. Funny thing is the text refers to the placesetting favors as treasured keepsakes,.... I think not."
1,I returned it...,I was very dissatisfied. I looked at some of the projects and they were really not something I was excited to do. I was very disappointed with the project and the lack of creativity.
3,good ideas,"There were some good ideas in this book. Unlike the invitation book, they didn't seem to be as origional. There were also favor ideas that wouldn't really be useful for most weddings. However, there were some cute ideas, I liked the tags they used for place settings. There were some tips that I wasn't aware of before reading the book. I do have to admit there are a couple of things that we might consider for our reception. I am looking forward to getting the other artful bride book."
2,confusing,"Unclear whether one battery, or two. Assume from comment that it is only one. I just bought battery pack at Home Depot, which was 2, for $59. So it may not be false advertising, but it is false ""implication"" if true. Not going to order just to find out."
5,excellent transaction,"Great transaction with buyer, fast shipping right on time, would do buisness with him or her again. Had my combo pack for six years needed new batteries, lot less than store. awesome ....Rich H."
3,"Good batteries, no problems yet.","Gave these to my father as he seems to burn his other ones up. Batteries were nice, but we were a little disappointed with the packaging it arrived in: Wrapped in tape inside one USPS flat rate envelope stuffed into another flat rate envelope. Would have preferred it had been shipped in a box with a little more protection considering how plastic becomes brittle in our northern climate. Found out after we ordered them that the local Home Depot had the same on sale: 2 for the price of what we paid for one...thats how it goes sometimes. Otherwise didn't have any problems with the quality of the product."
1,"""Adaptation"" has little to do with ""The Orchid Thief ""","The book, ""The Orchid Thief"" is wonderful. It is ashame that it is connected to the narcissistic screen play and movie ""Adaptations"". The only thing in common are the character names. I hope someone else will do justice to the book in the future."
3,Good but not what I expect.,"For one reason that I don't know, the videos of Juan Luis Guerra seems to be so ""chipy"". A person with the knowledge, experience and influences of Juan Luis Guerra should do a better job. In the case of the music, are the same songs but with a different rythm...like ballads no..no...no."
1,adjustable dog dish,this is so unstable i wouldn't buy it again. i have a screw that is bent and i don't feel like paying for it to be sent back so i will keep it and use the bowls or donate it to a pet refuge. if you have it low its fine but i have two large dogs and they will tip it over easy. i do not recommend this unless you have a dog under 30 pounds. mine are 60.
2,Annoying,"This bowl set did not work well for our dog. The bowls are definitely big enough, but they aren't very stable in the stand. I like our four leg adjustable bowl set better (even though the bowls are smaller)."
4,Nice Setup,"We thought this was a good idea for our Rottweiler puppy who is growing very fast. I did not want to buy multiple products as he got taller, so this works well. Easy to adjust, and it was delivered right on time. The 5 qt was a lot larger than I realized.... I did not even think about the size when I got it... I just selected the larger one because our dog will get pretty good. Easy to use product, raise and twist down knob to hold."
2,Didn't Like it.,"It didn't work for me.I didn't feel none of the results that this tablets suppose to give you, but I felt some issues with my digestion."
2,Didn't work for me,"I was told about this product by my bank teller. She looked incredible energized which was a total opposite of me... and after a huge research and all those wonderful reviews I decided to give this product a try.The shipping was very fast. But the product didn't work for me at all. I expected to get more energy and a better mood. However, as a result I got very depressed and sleepy. I couldn't concentrate and focus on anything. After stopping taking these pills everything became normal within a day.This product seems to be all natural so I have no idea why my body reacted like that. Hope that somebody else it helps better."
2,"Decent Pick, Misleading Description","Since this shows all of the colors and does not give or mention any way to select a specific color, I assumed I was purchasing an assortment. This is not the case, I was sent a single package of 12 M shell picks."
1,Don't Bother,"This is essentially a pamphlet, 57 pages, wire bound. The cover claims it includes ""Specialized and Rarely Taught Strategies for Taking Your Shooting Game to the Next Level."" I didn't find any of those strategies. It contains common knowledge that can be found anywhere, for free.It's priced at $15.95, yet the back cover indicates it was at one time sold for $10.00. It's not even worth that amount.There are much better shooting resources available on Amazon, for lower prices. Try those first. You'll get more bang for your buck.In summation, this pamphlet is the most disappointing purchase I have ever made on Amazon.com. Save your money!"
4,The Penis Unvarnished,"We American guys think we know everything about penises. But the truth is we know about our own--not the penises of our friends or men of other races and cultures. This book shows how circumcision can negate sensation. While USA guys love to parade our penises on nude beached in Europe oh so proud of the so-called superior beauty of a circumcised penis WHEREAS our European friends with their so-called UGLY uncut penises are having the last laugh as they get more of a thrill from their ""tool"" then we do with ours. The book shows us that the old rant about size NOT mattering is the bunk every guy has always known. Size matters to heterosexual women not to gay men as much. Read this to learn that a penis needs maintenance like an old wooden tennis racquet and needs to ""breath"" like fine wine."
2,okay...but not great,"there are many interesting tid-bits in this slim volume, unfortunately, the author, in a laudable attempt to provide comical/witty commentary, demonstrates a distinct in-ability to do so. in other words, she tries wa-a-ay too hard to be funny...and, she is not. still, if the reader is willing to wade through the unnecessary/uninspired verbage, some good information can be gleaned.i should also say that ms. gore deserves credit for tackling such an...unusual subject, no doubt she raised a number of eyebrows when telling folks about the book...and i'm guessing there may have been some mild confusion over it's claim to be ""an owner's manual""? seems a little, presumptious, margaret, unless there's something you're not telling us... : )"
4,"It's a Great Soundtrack, but the Remixes are even better!","This is a great soundtrack to an _amazing_ film. The music is so completely part of the film it's hard to imagine one without the other. I recently got turned onto the the City of God REMIXED collection and I can't beleive it's even MORE AMAZING then the orginal soundtrack album.Vibrant and passionate remixes that add depth and sophistication to these already incredible songs. I strongly reccomend the remixed album for anyone who can't get enough of this film as well as those looking for more great latin influenced tunes. Awesome, awesome remixes!"
1,"Clear Care is great, but seller is poor","When I bought this, the product image was a box that clearly showed two travel-sized bottles of Clear Care, with a lens cleaning container. After all, it's called ""Clear Care Travel Pack"", right? I was excited to find a smaller bottle of cleaner I can take on trips with me. After I bought it, seller changes the image, but leaves the product as ""Clear Care Travel Pack"". I get a single 12oz (very large) bottle of Clear Care. Ok, that's nice, but there is nothing ""travel"" about a single 12oz bottle of lens fluid. The packing slip had nothing to do with a ""Travel Pack"", it was just for a ""12oz Bottle Disinfecting Solution"".Emailing seller, they denied that it was supposed to be anything but a normal 12oz bottle, and said I could return at my expense for a refund.Clear Care is a great product, but don't buy it here, and definitely don't expect anything travel sized."
5,Ciba Vision Clear Care replacement available now at Walgreens.com,I have been looking everywhere recently for Ciba Vision Clear Care solution for my contact lenses but the store shelves are emptly. A few days ago I found Ciba Vision Aosept (essentially the same product as Clear Care) available online at Walgreens.com so I ordered 10 bottles which arrived today.
1,Dangerous product,"I don't know why anyone would buy this product - the potential for severe burning is too great if directions are not followed precisely. Add to this the cumbersome nature of the lens case which is required for use. I actually damaged one of my lenses trying to get it in the case.There are plenty of products on the markets which have no risk of burning, are much easier to use, and provide the same benefits."
3,quite expensive,"I expected deeper one so think 139 pages are not so thick for explaining whole thing of legal reasoning. I don't know why this book is so favorable to customers here, but I hope this book help me some in near future after reading it."
4,Excellent Guide for Understanding How to Write A Brief,"I am a paralegal student at a local community college in Philadelphia. I found Learning Legal Reasoning an invaluable resource for how to write a brief. This book teaches you how to phrase the question and answer the question asked, avoiding the extraneous points covered in appellate opinions. In other words, it teaches you how to think and therefore, compose a well-written brief."
4,Introduction to Law school,"I thought it was a great book to help i preparing for law school - do your own brief then check your answers... However, I found that it left out one important element (that or I just didn't pick up on it) in composing a brief- the rule."
5,Great movie,The writing on the front of the DVD says it all. Great for people who don't even like country music. This movie gets better every time I watch it.
2,Oh My YAWN-ness!,"I like country music. I like Gwenyth Paltrow. I like girl movies. But this really stank it up. How is it possible that something with so (very) much treachery, tears, music, and sexual tension could be so boring? I don't know if it was weak writing or lackluster acting or sub-par singing, but I'd really like my three dollars ninety-nine cents and one hundred twelve minutes back."
5,Country Strong Movie,I saw this movie in the theater and just loved it. Garrett Hedlund's singing was amazing. I bought it just for that reason. I was going to buy the soundtrack but saw that the people who sang in the movie were not doing the songs on the CD. So I did not buy it. I was so impressed with the actors voices in the movie. I feel they should have been on the soundtrack. They did a fantastic job of singing.
3,product sticker,"There is a sticker on the Country Strong dvd package that says alternate ending and on the dvd itself in special features it says orginal ending...I don't know what is up with that.also in the beginning the movie there is a big paragraph about views, opinions and commentary..but..when you go into special features there is no option for commentary...the deleted scenes answer the questions that the traier left out..The Trailer for the movie shows people who are not even in it and scenes that never hit the screen..the deleted scenes show it...but...there is one still that didn't make it to the deleted scene section.if anyone bought this movie and or went to see it on the big screen...write back to me...we can discuss it.."
2,Country Strong,If you like depressing movies this is one to watch. This movie isn't really about country music success it is about characters with tortured souls. Disappointing and depressing.
1,Country Strong,"I was very dissapointed with this movie. It has very few good songs, but worst of all, the plot is empty and extremely boring.Paltrow looks old and has lost her former beauty and looks. Don't buy it !!!"
1,Country Strong,"Was very disappointed in this movie and so sorry that I just didn't rent it and return it! Thought with the great cast it would be an excellent country music movie, NOT. It just makes Gwenyth Paltrow look like a loose drunk, Tim Mcgraw like an ignorant mute and her boyfriend and his wanna be girlfriend totally useless!"
2,there's little rockin' about 'country strong'......,"'country strong' has a lot jammed into its 2+ hour length, yet it doesn't really answer any of the ""who, what, when, or whys"".....as a result, you have a leading character (gwyneth paltrow) with a tumultous life, yet there's little reason to have any sympathy for her. there's another character--the husband/manager--who we're supposed to accept as the ""villain"" of sorts (tim mcgraw)--but instead you might actually feel sympathetic toward HIM after watching what he has to put up with. some people have talked about the ""suprise"" ending, which honestly came as no suprise to me (ask my wife, i called it about 40 minutes in, lol). there's so little to know about these characters, i just couldn't have imagined it ending any other way....it was just as simple as playing ""connect the dots"". if you're one of those types who HAVE to see this movie, reviews be damned, then at least watch it on cable & not spend your cash on a DVD..."
2,Disappointing Movie,I should have paid attention to most of the reviews. BORING. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.I would not even recommend that a friend watch my copy.
2,Gwen could sing more,This has all the makings of a great musical drama something like Coal Miners Daughter but alas a weak scripts destroys a good show. But kudo the stars can sing.
3,Not a great Movie,This movie was okay but a little on the slow side. Gweneth Paltro was definitely not the main person in this movie. It was the other girl. Much better actress. Overall all not a bad movie for country fans.
5,"Amazing music, acting and plot!","Not a fan of country music, I really didn't know what to expect when this movie was sent to me as a gift. But, I found out! I was amazed that TRON's actor Hedlund could entertain with such great acting and singing!All players did a bang-up job in telling the story of a fall from grace, and unconditional love.I have studied both movies intensely. The music is great in both, and as a result, I'm going to buy me a cowboy hat and be country when country is required! If this movie does not produce tears in at least four spots where the message is a poignant one, then something is wrong. To those who submitted low reviews, give this movie another chance. Watch it again!Y'all come back, hear?"
2,Ugh...Strong Start -- Prompt Disintegration,"Gwynyth Paltrow is lovely to look at, but this is a painfully pathetic role to pull off. Your husband isn't so in love with your anymore and he's eyeing other lasses, and your lover cheats on you, too. And so you fall apart and get drunk over and over again. Who cares! I couldn't even finish the movie. Garrett Hedlund is a GREAT new actor but I lost interest in him once his character degenerated."
4,Strong,"Country Strong is surprising. I expected a certain amount of cheese because the country music industry can be seriously cheesy, but Country Strong did not deliver. I was pleasantly surprised by this gritty portrayal of fame and addiction.Gweneth Paltrow was believable as the broken Kelly Canter, and Garret Hedlund gives a stunning performance as Beau Hutton. He seemed as if they really had plucked him out of a honkytonk in Nashville.The writer's could have done a better job developing the story more fully. I wanted more background into Kelly's fall from grace, and I wanted the character of Chiles Stanton to be fleshed out a bit more. Overall, though, Country Strong is worth watching. It celebrates the sorrow that country music used to be about."
3,Good movie about a celebrity trying to handle the limelight,"The script was pretty good. The directing, acting, and scenes were ok too. It was a little repetitive though and the romantic relationships seemed a bit spastic. It's almost like a country version of the movie ""Burlesque"". I actually enjoyed the supporting actors more than Gwyneth & Tim. Worth the $3.99 rental, but I don't have any desire to purchase this movie or watch it again."
2,The problem is the SCRIPT.,"The four main performers in this movie can all sing AND act...and needed those talents in this depressing, two-dimensional, dreadful flat-footed film. I don't think I laughed once...even the tiniest bit. I didn't cry at the sad parts because they were just too contrived. We splurged on ""first day"" tickets before reading any reviews; last time for that! And while Gwyneth CAN sing..and Tim CAN act; they are both MUCH better at their day jobs."
2,BORING!!,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ......I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT THREE STARS BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WORKED BETTER THAN AMBIEN. THE BEST NIGHT'S SLEEP I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!!!
1,What a Waste of Acting and Singing Talent!,"Really bad script, and decent acting by the main characters could not save that, nor could fairly appealing singing by the lead actress, Ms. Paltrow. We don't really even get to hear her singing till the finale, which is followed by one of the more bizarre but barely engaging plot twists ever. The script and storytelling deserve a negative star."
5,"We loved this movie!,",My 16 year old daughter and I went to see this movie...not really knowing a lot about it...we both loved it!! The main character isn't just Gwyneth...the lead guy Garrett Hedlund was just awesome in it! We actually want to go and see this again we enjoyed it so much!!
5,nice movie,I enjoyed this movie. Quality picture and the sound was terrific. I have no doubt this is worth the price.
5,Very Strong Film,"I actually enjoyed ""Country Strong"" and believe that all the stars did such a wonderful job! You will enjoy the music, the stars and the story!"
5,wonderful songs,I really liked this movie and the music is just great. I dont even care for country music and loved it and got the cd too.
1,Did not like at all,"I did not like this movie at all. It was bad. 1 start is really too good for it, but its the lowest I can pick.Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester did a good job and sang well. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty boring and seemed to suck the life right out of the movie.And don't believe the title, she wasn't country strong at all."
1,Country Strong,"I am a huge fan of Gwyneth Paltrow. That being said, I was very disappointed in the movie Country Strong. After all the hype, I found it to be very slow, the plot was dull and I kept waiting for more to happen. I did enjoy seeing Tim McGraw in a movie again. I loved the music but expected more numbers by Paltrow. She is fantastic on Glee and I was looking forward to seeing more from her. I would not recommend this movie to a friend."
1,Country Strong???????????????,"I hated this movie! Don't buy it! I won't give away the end to those of you who want to decide for yourselves, but you couldn't pay me to watch this movie again! Country Strong should have been titled ""Country Weak!"" The way this ends does not show ""Strength"" to me, only weakness.I wanted my money back after watching this one!Tonya"
2,Song lyrics not subtitled,"If you are dependent on subtitles this movie, which is about singers, doesn't subtitle one single song lyric. Maybe the people who made this movie think deaf people can hear songs."
5,Raw emotion and great music!,"I really love this movie. To be honest, the very first time I watched it, I was disappointed in the depressing nature of it, but I have now watched it at least 20 times since and LOVE it. It's definitely a watch more than once movie."
3,Mary Anne' opinion about product,"The speed of sending the dvd was great. It was here in less that 3 days.The movie was ok but not great. It was sad. I ordered it because I bought ""Proud Country"". It had a happy ending and you could watch it again and again. No so with Country Strong."
5,i real liked this i don't see why it wasn't more popular,i enjoy this movie. i thought the story was good.the acting was okay.the song were great & i will watch it over & over again.
3,It was okay.,This movie was fair. It held my attention and I will probably watch it again. My big problem with this movie is the ending. Without spoiling it for others...I just don't understand why you would title a movie as such when there is nothing 'strong' about the ending.
4,Great movie,"The actors are really good, especially Gwyneth Paltrow. Good story, good chemistry, I really enjoyed it. She would make a great country star!"
1,Country Garbage,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I think the best parts were actually shown in previews I saw prior to watching it. I don't feel that the story line was anything related to being ""strong"" so in my opinion the title (and the movie) are misleading. I recognize that the issues portrayed are reality in some cases, but overall the character played by Gweneth Paltrow is not capable of managing her own life and has allowed everyone around her (esp. her husband)to make choices for her and she is beyond being able to function. I am glad I didn't waste my money at the theater or on a rental since I was able to watch it at a relatives, who is also disappointed that she wasted her money on this DVD. I had high hopes but really only liked the subplot marginally. I believe everyone needs to form their own opinions on the movie, but I hated it. Depressing and not something that shows how wonderful country music can be."
1,Cliche after cliche,This movie may be called country strong but its more like country weak. The plot is disjointed and derivative. The acting was unconvincing. Gweneth Paltrow was not believable in the lead role either in her acting or her singing.
1,country strong,"Never received this item, however I was refunded my money. Hope to reorder it. Maybe from another vendor. Maybe have better luck"
2,Country Strong is Weak,"The first twenty five minutes of ""Country Strong"" are really good. Then it gets very slow and finally descends into cliché ""Star is Born"" territory. It's a shame too, because Gwyneth Paltrow is very good in her role, and the scenes with music are great, but few and far between. Watch ""Nashville"" instead."
1,Spoiler Alert!,"I think I was ovulating by the closing scenes -- one of the most estrogen-soaked movies I've ever seen. The role of the two lead men in the movie is to fawn over the two women, neither of whom is close to being worthy (for different reasons), although Paltrow has righteous stems and makes good use of short dresses and high heels to show them off. Tim McGraw, as Paltrow's suffering husband/business manager, proves that as an actor, he can furrow his brow with concern. Garrett Hedlund, the younger lead male, does an impersonation of Hayes Carll that turns funny, bad-ass Hayes into a wimp. I'm sure Hayes went out and got drunk after watching this awful flick.Spoiler: Gwyneth Paltrow kills herself for no reason at the end of the movie, unless it was out of embarrassment."
5,I can't wait for the next one!,"I could not put this book down. I cannot wait for the next in this series. While there were some aspects and plot twists that were unbelievably convenient for the story to continue, I realize I'm reading fiction and I thought the author did a wonderful job.I highly recommend this book for someone looking for a new contemporary suspense author. My main reason is - I did not figure out how the ""bad guy"" was until the author revealed it. Not very often that happens. I can always guess ""who done it."" Not so this time."
2,Ahhhh....Now I know why....,"Now, it all makes sense. I picked up this book at the library because it was in the Suspense/Thrillers section, but was VERY disappointed. I could not read past the first few chapters because of the really annoying dialogue--it read like a very forced casual dialog and read very silly and amateurish as did the THRILLER parts where she flashes back to the life of an abused child. I was wondering how someone could get this book published and now it makes sense. She is a romance novelist trying to do a suspense novel. This book will probably only appeal to her romance readers."
4,Excellent debut thriller,"I hesitated to read this, because I don't generally like romances, and romances are what this author is known for. Now I'm glad I gave it a try. It was a page turner from the very beginning, and followed two parallel stories: the serial killer and the detective. Though there were a few points where the romance author peeked through, they were VERY few. I usually enjoy authors like Patricia Cornwell, Stuart Woods, Iris Johansen, and Lee Child. I enjoyed this book just as much as any of them, and look forward to reading more from Linda Ladd in the future. The heroine was a tough female lead, and I enjoyed the Missouri setting, and hope to read more about her in future books."
1,Do Not Buy,"Pigface is purely a tool for Martin Atkins to exploit other artists that are more successful than him. I doubt any one besides Martin Atkins has seen a penny from Pigface sales, do not buy anything from this guy, he is not worthy of your hard earned money."
5,Their best so far !,"With a cool cast of many,this is by far Pigface's best ! Not including remixes. Its heavy ,dancie,(?),and even in a Pigface way trancie ."
3,Hmmmm,"I'm an old school Pigface fan. It kinda sucks, but I guess we need to realize there will never be another FOOK, Welcome to Mexico, Gub, Washing Machinemouth, etc.They've put out some good stuff, but really, nothing has been up to par since Notes, IMO. I do, however, enjoy much of the new stuff. It could just be a rut, the same rut that the rest of industrial seems to be in. It peaked in the early to mid 90s and had nowhere to go. So, at least Pigface it experimenting and seemingly trying to get out of it.I just wonder if Atkins has the right mix of people still. I want Ogre back, get him working the tape decks again."
2,not impressed,"well, I bought this album because I heard the song ""closer to heaven"" online, which features lacey connor from Nocturne and groovie mann from My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult. I was enticed by the rare pleasure of hearing two of my favorite bands brought together in a damn good song to buy the rest of the album. Well, although there are a couple tracks that might justify a couple listens, this is not a stellar album. Not impressed with Pigface overall, but maybe I should check out something else, as this isn't exactly their magnus opus. anyway, if anyone's a fan of closer to heaven, I recommend checking out anything by TKK or paradise wasted by Nocturne. unlike this album, those guys never disappoint!"
2,another ehhh,"I just found it to be a beating a dead horse kind of thing. The themes have just been over done,and it seems like noise for the sake of noise now. There were highlights,Lacey being one, But all in all I'm glad I got it used.The same things that made Pigface the amazing idea it used to be are now what seems to be killing it. Too much emphasis in creating outside the norm and it becomes all about that,and not what is being felt and conveyed in the music.Just MHO.Nick"
1,"The Dukes Of Dixieland, not.",I was very excited when I received my Dukes video so quickly (within a few days of purchase). My excitment quickly turned to digust when I put the video in the player. These peple were not the Dukes of Dixieland. I don't know who they were but their playing was mediocre at best. this was a terrible dissapointment.
4,Good basics,"This primer is a nice introduction to some of the more basic calligraphy and lettering techniques. Hufton's emphasis is on good form, good practice techniques and understanding the underlying basics of letterforms, rather than just focusing on copying the strokes right. At the same time, the numerous illustrations and diagrams make it easy to move through. The illustrations of incorrect letters are especially helpful. The wide format of the book is nice as it stays open fairly easily (it would have been even better if it had been spiral bound.)Her alphabets tend to be on the looser, more casual side, almost humorous. Many of them reminded me of lettering for signage. But taking cues from her helped me to make my own style a little less uptight.The section on projects is good for showing the creative process, especially for showing that you don't have to get it perfect the first time."
2,Did not hold up well.,"These sweatshirts seem to run small, I think I should have gotten 2 sizes bigger, I ordered a mens medium for a size 6 lady and it was much to snug for me. Then I washed and dried and I am almost certain they shrunk just a bit more...overall seemed like a waste of money becasue they were to uncomfortable to wear. Did seem like a strong warm sweat though. But with only 1 washing who knows. Would not purchase again. The russell athletic dri-power sweats are great though!"
2,color great fit sloppy,"Although it claimed to have nice cuffs and waist, I found it to be quite sloppy and loose around the waist."
5,egyptian cat necklace,Very nice quality item. It arrived in a package from Thailand and we were so excited. The shipper included a postcard from Thailand too! My daughter loves it and wears it constantly.
5,Latin Concise Dictionary,"There are approximately 160T entries in this volume. It coversthe supplemental history and culture for a plurality of latinwords and derivations. Sample definitions are as follows:o stega-decko laboro- to do worko sperata-brideIt is easy to read. Definitions are set forth in standard English. The volume is comprehensive . As such, it is an excellent value for the price charged. The work would be valuable for a plurality of latin scholars, journalists anda wide constituency of stakeholders in academe."
5,Latin Dictionary,This is a very good product for Latin Class at school. It helps to translate words. It is very useful when having to write a story totally in Latin for the words not used very often. Very worthwhile purchase.
5,Best Value in Words and Size,The Collins dictionary is not a large text in size or weight but it is in terms of volume and breadth of content. This dictionary was my constant companion as I translated a Medieval sermon and Collins had 70-80% of the technical terms found in the manuscript.I strongly recommend this dictionary for beginning Latinists and think those more advanced in the language would do well to keep a copy on their selves for reference.
4,Latin dictionary,The book was in very good condition and meets my basic needs for the translating needed in beginner's class. I would prefer slightly larger print & less space dedicated to grammar.
4,"not a must-read, but...","I just finished reading this one. I've read a lot of the scanlations before, though, and had thought that the series is good enough that I ought to at least buy the first volume of it, so that the author does get some well-deserved cash, sort-of... But after reading the del Rey translation, I feel all fired-up and enthusiastic about School Rumble again, and I certainly do intend to order the next one as soon as it's available. School Rumble has it's own unique sort of ""zany""-ness, and it's just plain fun! Of course the plot is not unique, but the way the story is told, and takes a number of unexpected turns, well... Any one who's truly interested in manga will be denying themselves a good thing if they don't at least take a good look-thru of School Rumble..."
3,Not good for kimono color photo orgy,"I agree that this book is good for DETAILED info on kimono wearing, etc. But I also agree with the review that it lacks the wealth of flat-out photos of beautiful kimono one might want if seeking photo memories of a trip to Japan. Consider John Gallagher's Geisha instead if you want more color photos of kimono."
5,This book is one of the most beautifuly written on kimonos !,"This book is one of the most beautlfuly written on the subject of the Japanese national dress, the kimono. Of all of the books I have read on the kimono, I found this one to be the most consice and entertaining . Nario Yamanaka, a leading athourity on kimonos and who has also established the Sodo Kimono Academy in Japan , truly knows the kimono and exibits its true beauty in a most lovely manner. Included in the book is a brief history of the orgin of the kimono, the process of making the garment, different types of kimonos for different seasons, the tying of the obi sash, beautiful color photos and kimono etiquette. There is a also a detailed step - by - step section on how to wear the kimono. If one is a true aficinado of the kimono, This book should be included in your library.I highly recommend it !!"
4,The essential kimono book,"The author really takes kimono seriously, and it shows. He founded an international group whose goal is to popularize everyday wearing of kimono. Detailed step by step instructions on how to wear the undergarmet, kimono, and obi or pleated skirt. Also, he includes pages and pages of beautiful full-color photographs. My only complaint is that he did not include more photos of formal kimono."
5,Most informative,"What is a geisha without her kimono?For those interested in the history of Kimono or thinking of wearing them, this book is a must have. A good bit of history as well as a guide on the wearing of the Kimono.Well written and very well illustrated."
3,"Okay, but not the best...","...of Hemmingson's books. An erotic private eye novel, more emphasis on the mystery/case solving than the eros..."
3,"Good read, but be careful to check out facts first","The book contains fiction mixed with certain elements of truth, and this can be very misleading especially to those new to Christianity. My advice would be for the reader to check out the facts on Matthias and his writings before reading this. What throws one off is that the disclaimer says it is a work of fiction, but also says that any references to the early church and all the footnotes are true.It is important to note that there is no Gospel of Matthias in existence (or it has not yet been found) and that whatever the author writes about its contents is fiction"
5,A masterpiece,"A magnificent book. Right up there with ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" as one of the masterpieces of 20th century American literature. It's truly ""serious"" fiction--but I never laughed so hard. Bravo Barnhardt! More, more!"
4,A Good Read,A Historical novel that takes a fictional plot and mingles it with historical Christian facts ... action plot and an education on the history of the Church all in one. Well done.
2,Who cares?,"When I first read a synopsis of this book, I was really intrigued. I normally enjoy novels which involve extensive research and are crammed with information. However, this book was a huge disappointment. Time-consuming research isn't enough. The material has to be integrated into and support the story. This author did neither. All of the historical data is in either vignettes that interrupt the flow of the story or are crammed into footnotes (Yes, footnotes!) which only a graduate student could love -- and then only a very boring one. Having spent so much time on research, the author then appears to have been too exhausted to write a good narrative. The characters are flat, uninteresting and ofter caricatures of a particular type. And the conversations with God are just TOO cute. Finally the book is at least 200 pages longer than it should be. Pass this one by. It's not worth your time."
2,The greatest story ever told in the most boring way,"What could be more exciting for a scholar of religions than to find a lost gospel, written by one of the disciples of Jesus?Certainly not this book. In a plot that's been tried before, William Barnhardt refuses to take truly daring chances.He instead relies on stereotypes and unrealistic plot turns.The characters were predictable, the plot devices unbelievable, and the final payoff unfullfilling."
5,A Wonderful Journey,"After I read this book, I wanted to immediately start it again. I loved this story (especially the crusty old men) -- it beautifully mixes fact with fiction . I have since read ""Emma . . . "" his first book - didn't enjoy it nearly as much"
5,"Bear, World Traveler","Offically, we own one of these bears, but hidden in the back of my closet are two ""back ups"" in case anything should happen to the original. This bear is the BEST! He's been dragged all over the world when we travel (was recently puked on in Hawaii) and has survived it all, no worse for wear! I throw him right in with the regular laundry and he emerges all soft and sweet-smelling. With no buttons or parts to come off, he's 100% safe and a perfect size for small hands."
2,leaves a bad taste,"This is a wonderful functioning product and since the last hot pot I bought has great new features however, there is a strong aftertaste to the water. The taste permeated the tea made with it and no amount of boiling got rid of the taste."
2,NO Instructions,I was so excited to get this and when I did I loaded the disk on my laptop did step by step and I still cant get it to work :/ IM so upset as i wanted this as a surprise Trash it goes I guess I knew it seemed to good to be true. Ive tried every USB port on computer to get to work ugh. GLad everyone got it to work it is very sturdy though more then I thought it would be :)
2,Programmable Scrolling LED Name Tag,"I was excited about getting a new one, my old one I had for 2 years (I purchased from a Teacher's Store). The new one lasted 1 month! Of course I thought it was the battery and invested in an expensive one ($7). When I put it in & it didn't work, I was very upset! I tried repeatedly to get it to work & to no avail. I was sceptical in ordering another Name tag because I didn't want to waste more $! Left a bad taste in my mouth!"
5,Excellent and Sturdy,"Vehicles Mix & Match Game by RavensburgerI purchased this game for my 2 year old who is obsessed with vehicles in all their many varieties. He absolutely loves it, and will drag it out (tipping the cards all over the floor...) to play with it.It has certainly helped his matching skills. I have not used it as a memory game as yet.The cards are extremely sturdy and are not looking ragged yet, despite the love my son inflicts upon them. =)Highly recommended."
3,handy for firewalls,"A nice collection of small grommets for running car stereo wires and amp power wires through firewalls and other bulkheads. worked very well and the storage case was very useful.A quick update, a few weeks after purchase I was rewiring a 1985 porsche targa and didn't have grommets for the front headlight harness. I was surprised to find that some of these fit perfectly. A pity it only came with two of the 4 I needed to do the whole job."
2,disappointment,"Very pleased upon arrival, heavy and appeared built rugged and stout. Tried to use it today to remove 11 dead rose bushes and on the very first bush you could put very little pressure on the spade or it would bend at the junction of the handle and the spade. By the second bush, you could put NO pressure on the spade or it would bend. No cracks, no breaks in the weld, just permanent bending - not flexing!Appears to me to be a design flaw, but contacted Bully today and waiting to see what they say and do. If the design has not been changed, I could not recommend the spade nor do I want a replacement.What a shame, made in the USA, heavy duty, but flawed!"
1,have not recevied,I ordered two Baseball caps and only recevied one. The paper work said that the Anaheim Angels hat was on back order and I still have not recevied it.
4,Nice Scarf,"It's a bit scratchy because it's wool, but it worked well as an addition to my Ravenclaw robe. Nice sew-on patch."
3,Decent Replica,"I ordered this scarf because I wanted a Harry Potter scarf and the ones they sell at Universal are at bit pricey ($30). It looks similar enough. The colours are all right and the label does say it's 100% lamb wool. I haven't worn it much, but I can see it being a bit itchy at times. It's not incredibly thick, but should be good enough to get the job done. My only complaint are the tassels. It's as if half of them are missing making it look very tattered. It's a small complaint, but for me it ruins the overall look. Otherwise I would have given it 4 stars. But other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Princess Bookcase,This piece is Super Cute as well. The hardest to put together though. A huge gap in the back wall. It was the best we could do! You love it! It's a great transition until a twin set.
5,Drives dogs nuts,"Can you think of anything more unappetizing. Not to dogs, they love these. I just wish they were less expensive."
5,The dog loves it,"My dog thinks this is a winner. When we get to the office every morning (yes, he goes to work with me every day), he always gets a couple for a treat. Again when we get back from running our morning errands. Then at night, when we get in bed, I always have him 2-3 for being a good boy all day. Is he good because of the treat, or does he get the treats because he is good? Who knows. All I know is that he loves them and I will continue to buy them. PLUS - They are made by a great company in the USA."
4,Easy to break up as training treats,"My dogs love these soft treats but then again, what dogs don't love soft treats? They are moist and stay soft after a few weeks. I tear them into two pieces for training. I will buy them again for value and quality."
5,Gone Thinking,I have a Teddy Bear breed puppy which loves to eat any snack that comes her way!!!!! So i searched out a wholesome snack for her and decided on Wellness treats and she loves them and i don't feel quilty spoiling her with these!!!!!!
5,"The Dogs say, ""YUM""!!","My dogs love these treats! They gobble them down so fast, I'm not sure they even taste them! And I like knowing that I'm giving them a healthy treat. Great product from a great pet food maker."
5,My Dog's Favorite Treat,"What can I say? You get what you pay for and these Wellness WellBites are worth every dollar. My dog LOVES these treats so much; she'll do anything for them. She chooses them over some other high-end treats that it wouldn't be nice for me to name here. The WellBites are soft so you can easily break them into food, put them in toys, etc. And they're made with healthy ingredients. WellBites are a win-win: Tasty and Healthy. Excellent treat! Highly recommend!"
3,"Very basic, but good information","If you have NO direct marketing experience at all, this is a good place to start. It covers all the bases. From list generation and offer development to postal standards.However, if you do have some experience and are looking to increase your knowledge, there are other sources I would encourage you to check out instead."
5,The Best Monograph I have purchased to date!!!,"Without bogging the reader down with endless scientific minutae, this book treats the entire family of cowries in a manner useful to scientists and serious amatures alike. I have several books on cowries and this by far is best. The feature I especially like is the large quantity of high quality photographs of each species giving the reader not just many examples of each species but showing all the subspecies and varieties and explaining the differences. The explanations of the biology, life cycles, habitat and habits etc. is easily understood by nonscientists yet very useful to scientists. My copy came without a dust jacket so I asume that it was published that way...While this book may be purchased directly from the publisher the savings is only slight and is eaten up by the shipping costs from Germany. I recieved mine from Amazon in less than 2 weeks by UPS ground."
5,World's best Encyclopedia of Cowries,"After receiving my Bivalves and Gastropods from MdM Shell Books for my birthday, I new that I would order from there again.I saw this book and new that now a wanted to look for more specialty books on my favorite species of shells.I found this book and new that I just had to have it, for the cowries are one of my favorite shell groups.With over 500 pages, covering all of the more than 200 species of living cowries, including black and white drawings of fossilized cowries.All of these species are illustrated on 128 plates.Although the book is pricy, it is well worth it for the amateur and pro alike."
2,Too much too fast,"While Scott Cole may a leading expert in Tai Chi, I found this video lacking (I also purchased the AM Workout). The moves are demonstrated in his studio. There is only 1 camera angle - directly in front of him. The moves are not explained in detail, rather he does the move while telling you about it. He then goes on to the next move. I am very new to all of this and would rather have it repeated a few times in the beginning as well as a camera shot behind him so I can compare my body stance with his.This video would be better suited to someone who is familar with Tai Chi and the moves to create a nice routine or add to one you already do."
3,"Well, my 2 1/2 year old doesn't know what to make of this on","...Basically, three Elmo's Worlda about ears, hands, and feet. My son (2 1/2). who loves Elmo, sort of stares at this one as if he isn't sure this is really his Elmo. The three episodes are certainly okay, but I think what really bothers him (and me) is that they replaced the usual end music (Elmo's World theme) by a new song Elmo sings about ""having two"". Normally, my boy gets quite excited at Elmo-dances around and shriekds with delite--but this one , I think he'd give it 1/2 thumb up."
5,Educational,"My daughter enjoys this DVD. Mr. Noodle is a little scary but it gives a great overview of hands, ears, and feet."
4,Not my favorite Elmo....,But my kids like it! It's nice to get different episodes than what we ALWAYS see on the Sesame Street reruns on TV.
3,No fault to the seller,"The battery works as expected. However, being NiCd, it doesn't hold a charge long and the battery gets a memory fast. This is just a problem with the design not the sellers fault."
1,Not for 7.2 Volt,this was not for a 7.2 volt battery. Ad and description were kind of misleading as I assumed it was a universal charger
4,"Ah, Diana","Bought this one to see Diana Vishneva, and she was delightful. Not hugely impressed with the more ""modern"" ballets, but they were certainly well done."
2,Was really too big for it's purpose,"If you have a really big dog with a big head this bowl may be just right. However, we bought this bowl to provide our medium size dog with the ability to get a drink of water where there might not be other water sources around while we are hiking or out and about. The bowl is HUGE which meant that just to get a 1/2 inch of water in the bottom of the bowl for our dog to get a drink seemed like it would require a whole quart. Probably not, but it seemed that way. We bought a less expensive bowl which was much smaller and is perfect. Hope this helps."
3,More compact would be an improvement,"These do not fold up. They will only somewhat flatten. If you're using them for trips, they'll probably work for you. If you're using them for hikes, runs or other outdoor activities, I'd get something smaller and/or compactable. These are bulky for attaching to a waist pack or Camelback - or whatever you use. Plus, we have two German Shepherd/Husky mixes - not small dogs. They don't drink this much water at a time, so the size is unnecessary."
5,Feed and water on the go for your pet. DONT forget to hydrate your pooch!,Feed and water on the go for your pet. DONT forget to hydrate your pooch!This rolls up and fits in your pocket but rolls out to use for water or food! Its perfect
2,"Intersting information, sad it has been found faulty","I had watched some of the content on you-tube, but kept researching and just after I purchased this, I found rebutal articles from trusted sources showing that later research has shown this ""ark"" site to be a natural formation and the information falsified. [...] This is sad, becouse this seemed to be a prommising site. but the Proponets of this video are decieving people with false evidence, see artilce at [...] I am glad i kept researching, but kind of miffed I bought the videos. a lesson learned"
3,A True Stephen King Collection,For all those Stephen King fans this is one package you cannot beat. You get all those great miniseries you have seen on TV in one package...great enough for hours of excitement.Would have been more then three stars if not for the lack of the stereo quality in some of the movies (it was monoural) but still a horror lovers dream.I wish there was another set like this.
3,"3 1/2 -- Not well balanced, but it has some keepers....","It's sad how many times true Stephen King fans will have to purchase his movies. He has so many, yet they put out a two volume set -- cleary there will be a 'complete' collection eventually. Cujo is cult-classic -- The Langoliers is an acquired taste, I found it great. The Stand is really a gem -- (that and The Langoliers) -- brilliantly directed, well casted and phenomonal. Thinner is an okay movie, nothing all too special, but still worth owning. Now, Golden Years, is what I found to be disappointed in. The movie is just boring -- a man races against time to find out how to stop from getting younger? All in all, if you're an avid King reader and movie collector, I'd pick it up -- if not, just rent the movies indivigually."
2,Uneven Collection,"Two stars for the complete collection. One of Stephen King's better mini-series in ""The Stand"" is mixed with some less than stellar efforts in the King department. I truly enjoyed ""Cujo"" (despite a specific deviation from the book that actually made a better movie) but cannot say the same for ""The Langoliers"" and especially the ""Golden Years."" ""Thinner"" is in the middling range of King adaptations. For me, it would have been better to purchase ""The Stand"" and ""Cujo"" alone. For King completists however, this might be the way to go."
3,A so so collection.,"Here are my thoughts on this DVD collection. Cujo and The Stand are great movies. Thinner and Golden years suck big time. The Langoliers would be great if only it were rereleased with some better special effects (primarily the CGI needs much work). All in all, not a bad collection, but only two out of five movies in the pack are worth keeping. However this is just my point of view, if you like the films in this collection, I would recomend it to you. After all, everyone is different, right. Well, thats my review."
3,Mixed Box (and that's my criticism),"""The Langoliers"" is great and ""The Stand"" is monumental. If ""Cujo"" is an acquired taste, I have not acquired it. ""Golden Years"" starts out all right and has its moments but peters out to nothing at the end. I haven't yet watched ""Thinner."""
3,"Great in some parts, drags in others","Way too much static 'people talking to camera' to carry this movie. Overly introspective. Would have benefited from quicker pacing. For example, the section on Kevin Hines, who survived a plunge from the bridge, really begins to drag on and on long after the relevant points have been made.'The Bridge' might have been strengthened by talking with some of the bridge workers or Coast Guard in order to round out the whole experience of Golden Gate jumpers.On the plus side, the cinematography is great. As I understand it, the produced used off-the-street local camera talent....which says something about how fertile a place SanFran is for the arts. Also, the narrative leading up to a couple of jumpers works well....sure wish he had been able to interview Gene Sprague's mother.Great dramatic effect created by interspersing cuts of various people which leaves you guessing which one will go over the rail.Overall, a good movie.."
2,Jump Already!,"A very confusing and frustrating movie to watch - they intersperse interviews with 5 different families in 2 minute segments. It gets so you dont know who is talking about whom. Then they repeatedly cut to people standing on the bridge and you wonder is this the person they are talking about? - most of the time it isnt.The only intresting segment was the one of the jumper who changed his mind on the way down, and how he survived.It all is towards a buildup of a ten second climax. It gets so towards the end you just want to say Jump! Get this movie over with!(I am judging this as a piece of filmmaking only; give a separate segment to each jumper, cut it down to 45 minutes, and you got a 5 star movie.)"
3,The Bridge,"A bit slow. It was interesting hearing about people who jumped, the person who survived and the families. I know many people who watched it expected to see the people hitting the water. It a sad movie that makes you think."
5,A MUST SEE!,"This isn't the easiest film to watch but an excellant film on an extremely difficult subject that is never handled. At first glance its depressing but there is hope in this film and Eric Steel handles two topics very well, mental illness and suicide. Both are seldom handle in a film this well. I recommend this for every one and you can usually get it out of your local library!"
1,its not what you think,"theres 4 or 5 money shots which are somewhat haunting, but the rest is 700 camera angles of the bridge,san fran and 20 people talking about people you dont know. Its impossible to get their stories straight, an interview with a suicide expert would have been helpful, and spelling San Rafael 'San Raphael' showed little knowledge of the area. The idea is brilliant, the production is good, but it swings and misses. Sucks because now no one will do a quality documentary about it."
3,Meh...,"It's hard to take the actions of some of these individuals--although I should stress not all of them--too seriously. Many of them apparently seem as if their own real ""struggle,"" is some sort of social desire--whatever it may be--and that their suicide attempt just so happened to take place at the Golden Gate Bridge strongly supports this opinion. Many of the individuals performed these actions as a last-minute plea for attention, but unfortunately, there are plenty of other individuals in this world who see far, far greater amounts of struggle, struggles far greater than the realm of ""not being the center of attention.""The bridge was well-crafted, but my sympathies lie elsewhere."
2,fun fun fun,"What could be better than actually seeing an idiot jump offa my local bridge? Why, watching several of them do it!Sure sure, you haveta sit through the psychobabble. Pretending this art-school film is given gravitas by the fog and crying family isn't an easy task when you just want the hopping to commence.You will find yourself saying...DO A FLIP!"
3,Don't Jump,Eerie DVD. Purchased as a recommendation from a friend. Watched it once and it's collecting dust in my dvd collection. This is a DVD I could have gone without.
4,Special Genre,I am not in suicide explorations - simply amused with the Gold Gate Bridge and San Francisco displayed.Next time in S.F. I should surely walk the Bridge.Interesting doco for the interested in psychological issues especially.
2,Hardly Concise,"Not a bad book, but, has grown much since last edition. Maybe the folks at Mayo forgot, but it's supposed to be a 'concise' review textbook. You might as well read Braunwald to prepare for the boards. A good editor needs to take a good strong red pen and take out about 300-500 pages."
1,Poor scientific assessment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"There are many papers published on heart abnormalities in CFS/ME patients, but this research does not seem to have been addressed by this book, so I consider it quite incomplete."
4,FABIAN HAD MASS APPEAL,"I'M GLAD THIS C.D. EXISTS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT FABIAN FORTE ANYMORE. HE WAS SOOO POPULAR IN HIS DAY, THAT LIKE ANNETTE, HE WAS KNOWN SIMPLY FOR HIS FIRST NAME ONLY.WE ALL WANTED TO LOOK LIKE FABIAN BECAUSE HE DOMINATED THE TEEN MAGAZINE COVERS WITH FEMALE MASS APPEAL ONLY SECOND TO ELVIS. THOUGH HE WAS NOT A GREAT SINGER, FABIAN HAD ENERGY IN HIS VOICE AND EXTREMELY GOOD LOOKS. FABIAN HAD THE BEST POMPADOUR IN ROCK HISTORY! THOUGH HE WAS SORT OF A MANUFACTURED TEEN IDOL, HE MADE IT! THIS C.D. CONTAINS ALL HIS BIG HITS LIKE ""TIGER"", WHICH WAS HIS TRADEMARK (HE WAS OFTEN PICTURED WITH TOY TIGERS AND ELVIS WITH TEDDY BEARS FOR HIS HIT ""TEDDY BEAR"".IF YOU WANT TO RELIVE THE FABULOUS 50'S, THEN ADD THE FABULOUS FABIAN (AS HE WAS KNOWN) TO YOUR COLLECTION!"
5,Good vise,"This vise is a great vise; it has a rest to place your pipe on, and a bender! Overall, I rate this vise as tops."
2,A Poor Choice - Try some others,"Paltry selection and other problems make this a CD to avoid. Many other excellent patriotic discs are available. For two superior recordings see Robert Shaw's ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" and The Washington Men's Camerata's ""Spirit of Freedom."""
3,Good one if you like this style of music,"I may agree with some comments that it is not the best CD ever recorded but it is certainly not the worst. There are two tunes that are not perfect, including ""Northern Lights"" better known as ""The battle Cry of Freedom"", but I will say that this CD is generally, a good quality CD. I have bought it at a very inexpensive price and I think that it was a good buy. If you look at something more standard, you may buy ""Songs of the U.S. Army"", ""Songs of the Marines"", ""Songs of the U.S. Air Force"" or ""Songs of the U.S. Navy"" that are excellent. It is a matter of choice and it is certainly an acceptable choice."
2,Not what I thought....,"for the cost I expected a better quality item. The single long cord is zig-zagged back and forth, then a flimsy plastic string runs cross-wise to tie it all together to make it look like a net. Lots of loose ends everywhere. I plugged it in as soon as it arrived and some of the twinkling lights were so dim, and barely twinkling, they looked like they were already burnt out.I ordered because of the previous reviews, but very dissapointed with product.Would never order this item again."
5,Here Come the ABC's,"My kids and I love this video. I bought it again, because we had lost the first copy we had."
3,Get 123's instead.,"My children were both mesmerized from the beginning with Here Come The 123's, so we got them ABC's for christmas. It has not been as much of a hit. The music is a little slower and the animation isn't NEARLY as good. A couple of the songs on the ABC's are not to be missed (alphabet of nations, and who put the alphabet in alphabetical order) and I'm sure my kids will want to watch it still, but it's not the instant classic that 123's was.Here Come The 123s [CD/DVD]Also, 123's has a song for every number from 0-12. There isn't a song for every letter, and while I didn't expect there to be, they aren't even in order (the ""e"" song is before the ""c"" song)."
5,This DVD taught my 26 month old the alphabet!,We got this for our two year old son and he can't get enough of it. The songs (as always) are great and the aftereffects-amation is mesmerizing. And when he's had too much TV he can just listen to it instead.
2,Not worth it.,Wasn't the best cd and/or dvd for teaching my two year old the alphabet or letters. No real focus or theme just random selection and emphasis of certain letters.
4,"Entertaining, but 123's is better","If you're only going to buy one TMBG, go for the 123's. Everyone in the family agrees it's better than this one, ABC's."
5,Love it!,"My husband is a big fan of TMBG and bought this months ago and our son didn't show a lot of interest (he's a bit wiggles obsessed). Fast forward six months and our son is 2.5 and LOVES this DVD. He knows his ABC's and this only reinforces what he is learning from us and preschool. The songs are great and have a good beat and it's something that I enjoy listening to also. It's fun, upbeat, and educational."
2,TMBG should stick to quirky alternative pop!,"This CD is a total JOKE, it is so BAD! It is an obvious 'grab' by 'John squared' (Johns Flansburgh and Linnell) for a piece of the very lucrative and booming baby market, and it falls short bigtime. The songs, if you want to call them that, are beyond quirky and follow overly-simplistic structure that anyone could have come up with in 5 minutes while sitting on the John (pun intended)! It is AS annoying as listening to fingernails on a chalkboard, and then some. Even my 8 month old stopped smiling when I put this drivel on, and usually she smiles and giggles when I play most of my other 'for baby' CD's. There are much BETTER choices out there for babies and kids music. 'John squared' should stick to making alternative music for the 'older set', which is what they are great at!"
2,"Good Music, Bad DVD","I bought this CD/DVD combo for my 17 month old son last week. He has only been watching TV for about 3 weeks now. We have watched the DVD twice and we really don't like it. The music is great and my son does dance to it. But the video clips for the letters are not kid friendly in my opinion. There is only one part where the alphabet is said in order, and that is with a robot and a little girl. The robot is hard to understand and the little girl talks like a baby. The song ""E eats everything"" is good visually and is pretty much in order but it continues to go back to the letter E for the corus. Alot of the skits are too fast for any child under 3 to visually keep up with. My son lost interest about 15 minutes into the program.We had some friends over and played it for them to see if our opinion was too harsh, and they all agreed that it was too much for a child, and definately not a good learning tool for the alphabet. We will continue to play the CD because the music was okay."
3,Not as good as Here Come The 123's,"I bought the 123's cd and LOVED it so we got the ABC's and I was a little disappointed. It's ok, but we prefer the 123's much more."
1,cswanmom,"I was very excited to receive this DVD due to all of the great reviews. As soon as I received it I put it in for my toddler. After about 10 minutes I turned the t.v. off. It was weird, over stimulating, did not have any kind of order and I felt if I left this on I was just going to dumb down my toddler. Was not impressed and regret the purchase."
5,My Twins Can't Get Enough,"My 2.5-year-old twin boys love this DVD. Lately I play it for them every day by request. They wake up from their nap chanting ""ABCs"" then they get wildly excited when I put it on. My kids already know the alphabet, but I still think this is an excellent way for young children to learn. Each song/video is creative, fun and highlights a different aspect of the alphabet. They cover specific letters, as well as the order of the alphabet, forwards and backwards! I used to go see TMBG at a little club called The Grotto in New Haven in the 80's, so it's extremely fun for me to share the music of this quirky and creative duo with my children."
5,GREAT product!,"What a great collection of fun songs and videos. Smart, clever, catchy tunes kids AND adults will listen to again and again."
5,"Great CD, lots of fun, adult friendly kids music.",It goes without saying that a little Barney can become nails across a chaulk board. I gave this CD 5 stars because our 20 month old son loves it and my spouse and I can listen to it with him and have fun with it. The tunes are catchy. Something you can goof around with and sing along with. The alphabet is a big deal right now with our son (he loves ABC books too) and this makes learning lots of fun. We loved this one so much we eventually bought Here Come the 123s.The DVD that comes with it is interesting to say the least. A couple of the songs on the CD were obivously made for the video portion as the song makes sense once you see the video. Good use of puppets and animation.
3,cute for 3-5 year old girls,"these movies are well done. animation is bright and creative. The voice talent is not there though, none of the new strawberry shortcake movies have any voice talent. That's fine if your'e a kid but as an adult it's a little annoying. It sounds like the animator's kids getting to read the script. One thing I don't like about the new dvd's is that the emphasis is not about being a kid and having fun, the emphasis is on fashion and looks. It is like a big ad for strawberry shortcake merchandise---beware!"
4,You will enjoy this pleasant surprise!,"I am very plesantly surprised with the strawberry shortcake videos!!Something different, Cute, catchy and great for kids to watch!They really bring the strawberry shortcake characters to life and give them all such personalities!!!I highly reccomend them for any Strawberry shortcake fan!"
1,DO NOT buy Broderbund products!,"i've just spent 7 to 8 hours troubleshooting - and perusing the net to find absolutely nothing in the way of assistance from this company. the technical support site listed (www.valusoft.com) for mac is not valid. i'm running a powermac g5 i purchased in late 2005 and this software will not even load correctly; (even though i more than meet the requirements on the 'readme' file). i have been able to load the browser and nothing else. (and you would not believe how DATED this thing looks!!!)do yourself a favor, do not buy broderbund. use your own digital camera and generate your own stock photographs. this is a complete rip-off and i will never purchase anything they offer in the future."
1,Doesn't work on laptops,"It's difficult to give this product a 1 star rating when it doesn't even work, but that's the lowest possible rating available. What they don't tell you on the box is that this program hasn't been tested on laptops! And quess what, it doesn't work. When you go to the recommened support website they tell you right away. What's more, they state that if it doesn't work you are out of luck. (...)"
1,"sing withc, sing death","goodness, what a horrible stupid book. I was so disappointed. could this have been her first effort? Where was her editor? At least the grammar was good.Unappealing cardboard characters with a plot that was so far fetched as to be laughable. Roberta Gellis has written some very good stories, just not here."
2,Disappointing,"Reprint now available as ebook.I love the Gothics from the 1970's But this one was flat.The characters were one dimensional.I did not feel the romance between Pamela and the hero.If you are in the mood for a good Gothic romance, reach for a Victoria Holt."
5,Great Swan Lake DVD,"I do not know much about ballet and started enjoying recently. I saw Swan Lake by ABT and NYBT live but this was the best. I enjoyed it so much and watched it over and over thanks to Yulia Makhalina's excellent performance.Although I enjoyed ABT and NYBT's performance, it was the first time that I felt like watching a real Swan in this Kirov's Swan Lake and could feel sadness and beauty of Odette. Makhalina performs Odette so beautifully and sadly and performs Odile so sexy and confidently at the same time. For odile part, I liked how she expresses in her eye before doing spins. I loved how Odette appears and dances in the lake for the first time. I also liked the part where Siegfried looks for Odette to ask for forgiveness. I don't know why nobody mentioned about this Swan Lake DVD. Please try it!!! You will really enjoy it."
3,Swan Lake,"Amazon was wonderful, as usual. Great, fast service. I was required to write a dance assessment on Swan Lake. It is a classic, very precise. A great ballet. It was a little long for me, but very intertaining."
1,Not impressed,Didn't like the revised ending and I think the music was less impressive and dynamic than what I remember on PBS productions.
4,Melissa and Doug Multi-Activity Table,"The box arrived in very good condition from the supplier (Fat Brain Toys) and was very easy to put together. I am very impressed by the drawer design, which includes a dowel on the inside to keep is running smoothly. The drawer was a little tight at first, but loosened up enough after 5-6 openings that our 2-year old had no problem opening it. If would be nice if there was two drawers (side by side) to provide more storage. However it is still very nice the way it is."
4,Activity Table,"We recently got this table for our sons (ages 4 and 2) for their trains and they love it. It can be a little difficult to set up the train bridges because they don't fit across the table very well, and we thought it would fit more track on it, but it is wonderful to be able to have the trains set up all of the time for them to play with easily."
3,Xmas Gift,"My son received this as a Christmas gift. It is a great table and it is multi-functional. Here is my only concern with this table. Where the two top boards meet in the center of the table, it does not sit completely flush. So one side is slightly higher than the other. Which can make for pushing trains, cars, etc around the table a little challenging. Other than that, it is a good table."
5,good choice,I purchased this item for my grandchildren and they love it. I was so appreciative of the way it was packaged and the wonderfully easy instructions for putting it together.
4,Doug and Melissa Activity Table is a great value,"My son got this table for his Thomas trains this Christmas and he loves it. The directions to assemble it are a little convoluted, but you can figure it out easily enough from the extensive diagrams provided with the instructions. It feels a little shaky until you get it placed where you want it and lay the tabletop boards in. It is more solid after that and ready to go. Fits Thomas wooden railway configurations perfectly and nicer price tag than the Thomas brand one. I'd recommend this activity table for the value."
5,Activity Table,"We got this for Christmas mainly for a train table for our 18-month old son. It's just the right height for him and it seems to be very durable.I love that it's the type of table where you can do craft activities or a puzzle or set up the train. It's not limited to a train table.There was a little bit of an issue putting it together. It seems the holes were not manufactured to line up but it was workable. They could have done a better job with that. The drawer could be bigger too. That's probably my main complaint. There is all that extra space underneath and just a tiny drawer.I liOverall, we do love it. It's a great table. Fairly easy for us to move. Great height. Plenty big and it looks great. I would recommend it."
2,Looks terrible after nearly a year,We haven't had this table for even a year yet and the white perimeter is all chipped and the green table is all scratched up. This is with normal play on it not any unusually rough playing. Now it looks very ugly and I regret buying it. Poor quality!
4,Activity Table,"We bought this because the price was great and the Melissa & Doug Line of products are well made. In all honesty, its a Christmas Present for my three year old daughter so I haven't set it up yet but I have looked at it and it seems durable. the company who sent it did an excellent job packing and they were super fast and quick."
5,"Train table needed, but shop around.","There are tons of reviews here so I just want to make a few points:1) A train table for a train set is mandatory for proper fun. My Chuggington interactive set got no use after a week, until the table.2) I like this table alot, but there are other choices so shop around.3) consists of particle board with white paint, balsa wood cross beams and small drawer. Easy to put together, made in China, size is adequate."
1,Super Disappointed,I put this table on my list because I was under the impression that all Melissa and Doug toys were made in the USA. Their website is a little misleading in saying that they are the manufacturer of all their toys so they can control the quality. Imagine my disappointment when the box arrived and Made in China was written all over the outside of the box. I could have gotten the table at Costco that came with a Train for $100 bucks if I wanted something made in China. I have some of M&D's other products and they are all made well and have been very durable. I am completely disappointed in the quality of this product. It is made with cheap parts and when put together is not as sturdy as I would think a table like this should be. This will not be something that will last a lifetime. My son will get a few years of use out of this before it is falling apart.
3,Nice,"The table is nice, nothing great, but does the trick for storing the Lego's with some space below it to add extra storage bins"
3,Decent table for the money,"As the price indicates, this isn't a high-quality table. But, it serves its purpose. We preferred to spend more money on a nice train set, and save some cash by getting a lower-end table. The pros are that it is very roomy and has a storage drawer which accommodates our 130-piece set. The cons are that it is already showing several scuff marks on the white paint, and it's only a month old. It was extremely easy to assemble, and took about 30-45 minutes. Note that it is quite low to the ground. Our two-year-old has to be on his knees to play with it. So, if you're looking for a table that your child can stand at, this one's not for you."
5,Melissa & Doug Train & Activity table,"I ordered this table for my Grandson for Christmas - He is thrilled with it.It was very easy to put together, the storage drawer is a plus that most of the tables we looked at did not have. It seems very sturdy, he has climbed onto it to play with his trains with no problems. I was exceptionally happy with the prompt service. I ordered this last minute and had it within 3 days."
3,adequate,"The table arrived promptly with all parts and the directions included. During the assembly, one of the bolts busted through the composite wood side, which surprised me because I thought the table was made of solid wood. But eventually it was assembled and enjoyed by the grandchildren."
3,Not bad,"I ordered this table because I already owned the Melissa & Doug trainset. The table is inexpensive compared to the other tables by Kidcraft or other makers. You get what you pay for - because the table is fairly flimsy. It's adequate and does its job, but it's only a little more sturdier than cardboard."
5,Love this table!,"As with all Melissa & Doug products, this table is well-built, and holds up to lots of use from our 4.5 yr old and 11-month old! It's great that it can be used for building trains, coloring, building blocks, and lots more. It's also nice that it's tall enough underneath that we can store trucks and toy boxes underneath, and save more space in the playroom!"
2,Decent table but not durable,"We got this table for our 2 year-old, although our 3-year old uses it as well. It was easy to put together and looks nice. I would recommend using something like glue to keep the top down as it is not secured and may flip if a child climbs on it. Also, the materials are weak. I tried to slide the table over to vacuum and the bolts broke through the side of one of the supporting panels. I was kind of shocked as I had never had any issues with Melissa and Doug products before and the table seemed strong, but this is a cheap train table and you can't expect too much. On the plus side M&D customer service was great and agreed to send a replacement panel. Still, I don't expect this table to survive long."
5,Very Pleased,I bought this table for my 2 year old son's wood train set. It was fairly easy to put together and is very sturdy. I like the storage drawer to put the extra train set pieces in. I also like the fact that this table can be used for multiple activities/toys. It will last us for many years to come.
5,Great table,Bought this table for my son's 3rd birthday. Wasn't too sure we picked the right one (we were thinking about getting the Kid Kraft one instead). But my husband and I are very pleased with this table. It's very durable. It was a breeze to put together. My husband even said that it took less time than he had expected...less than an hour. And it's a nice looking table as well. I am extremely happy that we choose this table and would recommend it to anyone.
2,"Smashed box, missing directions","We purchased the Melissa & Doug's Train Table from Ouray Toys via Amazon.com, because of the drawer, price and quick availability. The table arrived on time as quoted. However, the box was damaged and it was apparent that it had already been opened prior to us recieving it. Once we opened the box and prepared to assemble the table, we found - 1) the first page of the instructions were missing and 2) the instructions that came with the table had been crumpled up and shoved in the box 3) one corner of the table has some damage to it, 4) inside near the drawer there was was a gouge in the wood and 5)the green part of the floor of the table had obviously been repainted with a different shade of green and whom ever did the painting did a very poor job. If you are thinking of ordering this product, order well ahead of time and inspect the product before assembly."
1,Very Fragile Construction,"My wife attempted to move the table a few feet on the carpet when the back panel snapped off. The fasteners for the back panel were supported by less then 1/8"" of the fake wood material."
1,Cheap hardware,I bought this at Christmas time and the hardware and wood are cheap. I spent more money to buy new hardware. I read the other reviews and I agree this is horrible.
2,This is NOT a Legos table.,"When I searched for Legos table, this came up. I assumed this green was all Legos base for building structures. Unfortunately, I have no use for the table now as the purpose was to have a Legos table. I could have added the base plates to an ordinary table that I had an saved myself $100. Those base plates are $14.99 EACH for a 14x14 square. It would take a minimum of like six of those. I should have obviously paid closer attention. I also thoguht there was some sort of bottom underneath of the green. They lift up and there is just a small drawer. Otherwise the Legos would fall to the ground. Too bad its already put together. If I had known, I would have sent it back."
1,This product made my nephew cry?,"I was going to give my nephew the best christmas present ever. He was going to get a beautiful table and train set. I with with Melissa & Doug because of the duriability of the products. Well when ever we opened the box there was absolutly no trains included with htis package. He then cried and said that Santa lost his trains and would not calm down after that. One kid after another was crying till christmas fell apart at the seams. I had many train sets with tables to choose from and I went with this. Please dont buy this expecting trains to come with it becuase all you will get is disapointment and let down. The hinges on this are little plastic pieces that assist the table to rock up however, if you pick them up they will fall off. This product should for ever change the way that any one views and Melissa and Doug products its a shame too."
2,Sad Quality for Melissa & Doug,"We put this table together on Christmas Eve and not 6 days later, it's coming apart. It's not very sturdy and the white siding is cheap, to say the least. Returning it and getting something more hardy."
3,Check your parts!,"We bought this table for our 3 year old for Christmas. Due to the size of the table and our lack of a place to assemble it without our son finding it my husband waited until Christmas Eve (during the day) to assemble the table at a neighbor's house. While the table was relatively easy to assemble, one of the main wood support pieces was was warped and cracked. Thankfully our neighbor is quite the wood worker and had tools galore to help rectify the situation AND it was still early enough in the day to make a quick trip to buy some lumber. My husband & neighbor fabricated a new piece and got the table assembled. Aside from that hiccup and its untimely nature, it's a great table and has been in use non-stop since my son unwrapped it on Christmas.The warped wood support seems to pop up every few tables or so based on the reviews here on Amazon. Check the parts well in advance of giving it as a gift to avoid any delays."
1,Craftmanship is unacceptable,"After assembly, the table was not what I expected. The drawer didn't fit correctly. The edges on each corner was uneven. Overall I was extremely dissappointed and had to take it apart and return the table."
1,Worst Quality,This was made with such poor quality that it literally started disintergrating while it was being assembled which was surprising given the reputation of Mellissa and Doug products. The panaels aren't even made from pressboard but press cardboard which was little more than paper mache. Chunks of it just started coming off especially where the screws join two pieces together. Very dissapointing.
2,functional but flimsy,"This does what we want it to do and it went together easily but...1) The package arrived all beat-up, thankfull all the parts were present2) Seems a little flimsy to me and could make better us of space with an additional drawer for storage."
3,CUUUUUTTTE and Durable,"The title basically says it all.The table is cute, it looks nice in almost any play room. It is well made and quite durable. My two year and walk on it without me thinking she might crash through it.She loves playing at it, its a good height for kids between 2 and 5ish.Cons;Can get any chairs under itThe sides of the table top leave little areas for pinched fingers, not a big deal if they cant lift the table top though, but for parents it can hurt!!"
1,A reasonable book but the online resources it boasts about really suck,"The book is OK, but don't count on finding any of the online stuff that the book boasts about on the back cover. I have looked everywhere trying to find it, but to no avail. I think they discontinued all the premium content or something. The website it gives to enter your registration code doesn't have a place to register. I recently emailed McGraw Hill tech support to ask what happened to the online content, but I am still waiting for a response."
4,A little off,"Having been on Parris Island, reality experience was a little more harsh. The DVD is good but they missed a lot of the routines that take place during training. The first half of the documentary is very exciting, it shows how new recruits are being transformed. Towards the end of the documentary, they showed too much of the crucible. Obviously documentary directors like this one would never show the public the whole truth because they're not allowed. There is much propaganda in the Corps. Boot camp in reality is ten times harder than it seems in this video. Overall, the video is a good starters kit for young people joining the Corps. Good luck and God bless the Corps."
5,"The most incrediable drums set, sounds AMAZING!",Honestly this drums set is the best set i have ever personall;y played. It sounds amazing an looks beautiful. Im so happy i decided to get this set because its the best thing i have ever spent money on in my life. But got to play them for 2weeks and 4 drums cracked. pissed me off alot but they compansated for it by sending me a new one. Thank you Total Music Sorce.
2,unfriendly to homosexuality,"This book is very unfriendly to homosexuality. I sigh for the lesbians and gay men in China who have to tolerate the so-called scientific sexologists. I read Dr. Liu's other books in Chinese, which are also homophobic. Another scholar, Li Yinhe, is a more gay-friendly scholar in China."
5,Beyond E is a home run,Steve Diorio has given form to and captured the elusive ingredients that so many of us have missed as we have poured money and effort into our internet sales strategies only to be rewarded with an empty feeling and an ache to know where we have gone wrong.It is clear that his experiences with the best companies in the internet sales universe have given him a perspective that wins the game. He is really generous to share his knowledge in this well written book that gives the interested executive an unbeatable step by step perspective. Steve seems to know more about how to successfully harness the internet than anyone I have read or met.
5,A Book That Actually Helps,"In an ocean of business books, Beyond e stands out as a prize catch. Too often, today's ""gurus"" write books that trumpet their personal accomplishments conveniently leaving out practical applications to specific business category needs. If we want real solutions, the cost raises from a $25 book to $25,000 per day consultation fee. Steve Diorio gives it all away in his book. Beyond e can also be called beyond best practices. He is the one guru I would invite to help my organization apply new technologies to our sales and marketing efforts. Read the book, pick up the phone and give him a call."
1,Never worked.,The Giga pets puffball handheld game never worked. Was extremely disappointed. Piece of junk. Would not recommend!!! Total waste of money.
4,Great for learning SAS fundamentals,"I have recently purchased this book for preparing myself for the SAS base programmers test. I find the book very helpful in strengthening my SAS fundamentals. As I haven't written the test yet, I cannot comment on its usefulness for the test prep.The book also comes with a CD-ROM containing SAS examples. But I did not find it very interesting as they don't motivate you to work on the programs or assignments. They are just examples, as good as the examples in the text.The book is not perfect only because of the CD-ROM feature, else it would get my *****."
4,Passed Exam After Using Book,Good book and good examples. Would like an overall quiz for the end. That is the only think holding me back from 5 stars.
2,Passed SAS Base Programming Certification Test for SAS9 by using the guidebook,"Bought the Prep Guide (SAS9) two months ago, read it twice and didall quizes after each chapter. Then, reviewed the book contents andall problems again. The information is massive, you got to put themin an organized way so that you are able to retrieve them easily andfast when you are taking test. Answering 70 questions in 2 hrs, thereis a plenty of time. Good luck!"
2,bad,I got broken CD-ROM with this book and even book was not properly packed so when I received the book its all broken cover...
1,Worse than ever,"Wrong discription in title, he never send me a CD although item invoice says with CD............Wrost purchase ever"
4,Love at first read!,"This is the first book I happened to read in the Jane Lawless series; I found it at a local bookstore earlier this year and bought it because, much to my delighted surprise, the protagonist was a lesbian. My delight continued as I read the book. Jane is wonderful and believable; the mystery is believable and well-plotted.My only problem with the book was that I would have wanted a bit more of the lesbian element brought out. On the other hand, Jane was portrayed as a regular gal; her sexual preference was not a big deal or particularly unusual in the book. Perhaps this is how it should be in real life as well. At any rate, I give high marks and many kudos to this book. All mystery lovers (especially ""cozy"" mystery fans) will enjoy it. I can't wait to read the rest of Ellen Hart's Jane Lawless series."
1,mock waranty,"This vaccum is absolute useless. The company claims a 2 years warranty which is mock. My machine was giving a burnt smell just 4 months after i bought it. I took it to the ""AUTHRIZED REPAIR CENTRE"", and they were asking for a 60 dollars to replace the faulty things. I threw this vaccum in my garbage and will buy a better one now."
1,Worst. Vacuum. Ever.,"I second the other reviewers' comments about this vac spewing dirt and yuck everywhere - I avoid vacuuming b/c it just makes my house dirtier, thanks to this horrible machine. Plus, if you have pets of any kind, forget it. Hair gets caught in this machine and doesn't even make it into the canister - it sits in between the can and the motor, so when you remove the can, you have to pull this giant wad of yuck out with your bare hands. Also, I don't consider using a paper clip to fish hair out of the motor compartment to be acceptable, routine maintenance. I can't wait to rid myself of this machine. Don't waste your money!"
2,Bagless?- YUK! Buy if you want to see dust bunnies to FLY,"This vacuum sucks! I bought it from Target after my Kenmore exploded. First off, I can't believe most vacuums are bagless now! It is absolutely disgusting to empty the canister- and empty it frequently. You also have to bang out the filter in the trash can- better make sure the can is outside and you are wearing old clothes! Second, the exhaust fan is pointed in front of where your vacuuming. I have never seen dust spin up into the air before. No matter how hard you try to get it, it flys away from you- crappy design. Seriously, what moron designed this vacuum and who's the moron's friend that allowed it to be manufacturered? Third- the thing is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO loud and it shudders when you turn it on. Finally- the cord gets hot after less than 5 minutes of use.Oh, I guess the reason why I gave is a whopping 2 stars is because it IS light and pretty powerful."
1,please save your money!,"This is been one of the most disgusting vacuums I have used. Sure, the suction is okay, but the front of the vacuum blows air, so whatever you are trying to vacuum up, gets blown around by the air first so it takes double the time to get it. Secondly, since there is no bag, you physically have to lift the filter out (with all the dirt and dust bunnies attached) and shake it out in your garbage can. As you are doing that, all the fine dust and dirt filters up out of the can and litters the floor so you can vacuum it up all over again, not to mention all the dirt that gets on your hands from having to shake out the dirt. I would NEVER buy this product again. Maybe the one with the bag is better, but I'm through."
1,Worst Vacuum EVER!!!,"This is the 2nd Dirt Devil I've gone through in under a year. Like all of the other reviewers state, this vacuum spits dust and debris into the air while you vacuum.While vacuuming with this machine you will be standing in a dust cloud in your house sneezing up a storm from all of the dust and allergens.Then, after vacuuming, you have to go around and wipe down all of your tables and everything else with a feather duster because this vacuum simply transfers the dirt from your carpet into the air.I can't believe this thing actually made it to market!"
2,Waste of money,I hate this sweeper.It's heavy.It doesn't pick up well.It won't stand upright anymore (cheap pedal design).The filter gets hopelessly clogged with dirt.Don't waste your money
1,blows too well,"I have to echo the comments of others this vacuum has its exhaust right in front down low so it really would work better as a leaf blower as the exhaust pushes everything out of the way before you can get close enough to get it....I have never seen such a poor mechanical design as this ...and am totally perplexed as to how this ever got into production and out the door ...dirt devil should be ashamed of themselves, I will make it a point to tell others about there poor design and function...good luck dirt devil your days are declining"
1,Marginal performance - a pain to clean,"After 20 or so vacuum sessions, I had to remove the cover plate (which involves unscrewing 4 screws w/ a Phillips screwdriver) and spend a half-hour with haircutting scissors snipping my daughter's hairs off the brushroll so it wouldn't smolder when running the vacuum.I'm not terribly mechanically inclined so I had to search by model number in Dirt Devil's website to find the PDF manual.It picked up dirt a little better after that & the burning smell went away but I still sneeezed at all the dirt it spit back out in the living room.I've been eyeing a new Kirby Sentria on ebay for around $600, a 1/3 the price the salesman was asking.Save your money and get something better."
1,Rubber band wears out too fast.,"It does a great job of vacuuming. My only complaint about this vacuum is that, after a few months, the rubber band that connects the spinning brush rollers (for use on carpets) on the bottom of the vacuum to the motor gets very hot and starts to burn and melt and eventually just break. After replacing it for the first time, it wore out even faster. After replacing it about 3 times, it will now only vacuum a few sessions before breaking. If you own this vacuum and smell a burning odor while vacuuming, that's the rubber band overheating and melting. Five stars for doing a great job of sucking up dirt and dust, don't get me wrong, but as far as durability goes, it's terrible. Spend a little more on a vacuum that won't wear out so fast."
3,"Does the job, year after year.","Got this vacuum 7 years ago and use it almost everyday. Never replaced a single thing on it. Still sucks like a champ. Everytime I use it I can see the canister feel with dust. Yeah, it is loud and dirty to empty, but for the price, it works fine. Like every product, there are duds out there. I just happen to pick out a real durable vacuum that stands the test of time. I think it is ridiculous to spend $100 or more on a vacuum. Save your money and take a vacation instead. Its just a vacuum."
4,Dirt Devil Jaguar,"We've had this vacuum for a few years now, and overall, we really like it. We have two dogs and four cats, so this has quite a job to do, but it does it pretty darn well! It has nice suction power, and the proof is in the container: it picks up a lot more than many other vacuums! The only complaint we have is that it goes through belts pretty quickly, but other than that it's great! For the price (on sale at Target for $40), it can't be beat!"
3,Powerful vacuum but has flaws,"Bought this vacuum at target several years ago - very powerful and I actually like the bagless vacuum idea. The most major flaw is that the back wheels are screwed straight into the plastic base instead of a metal plate, and both the back wheels have now broken, making the vacuum useless unless I spend $45 for a whole new base! The other flaw is the cord is way too short."
1,Worthless,"As I'm writing this, I can still see the cloud of dust spat by this vacuum into my kitchen. This vacuum is absolutely useless: like the other reviewers said, it sucks dust up, only to spit it back out in front of you. If I'd known such backwardly designed vacuums actually existed, I would have done some research before I bought this thing on Craigslist."
1,Exhaust Fan Blows Dirt Up Before You Can Suck It Up!!,"This vacuum is ridiculous. I don't understand how anyone could have designed such a vacuum in the way that the fan blows in front down towards the area you're trying to clean. So instead of reaching any dirt to suck up, it just gets blown up into the air. I guess you could say this vacuum blows."
2,Poor Belt Design,"I purchased this vacuum when it was on sale at Target a couple of years ago. Initially, it worked well. About 6 months into using it, I noticed a burnt rubber smell as I would vacuum my floors. I removed its bottom plate and found that the vacuum belt would rub against part of its plastic wall as the belt rotated (hence the friction -- burning smell). So I shifted the belt slightly away from either wall, but I knew this problem would return within a few more vacuum sessions. Anyway, one of my roommates used the vacuum, and the belt tore apart. So I either need to buy a new belt or a new vacuum.I noticed no one else has mentioned this defect, maybe Dirt Devil has changed their design. Regardless, my next vacuum purchase will be a Hoover."
3,Competent and entertaining,"Another workmanlike entry in the NJO series. Rebel Dream falls in the fast, fun read category; it's more narratively coherent and consistent than the previous NJO book (Dark Journey), but definitely not one of the best books in the series; on the plus side, it's nice to see old friends (e.g., Wedge Antilles) brought to center stage, and there are fun (if unlikely) sequences (like the New Republic infiltration team sky-boarding in from orbit); but the read is marred by editorial lapses (Danni Quee suddenly gains blue eyes, when she's been green-eyed for the previous ten books) and the biggest bad-science howler I've ever encountered, even by Star Wars standards (New Republic forces fire a laser beam--thorugh normal space--at a target in another solar system--several light-years away--and the laser beam hits the target on the same day that it is fired!)."
4,One of the better books of the series,"I must say that this is certainly one of the better books of the series. It's no Star by Star, but it is certainly one of my top 5 favourites of the series.The space action is very well written [as is expected from Allston], and there is some of Allston's traditional humour, although not the same kind as in his X-Wing novels.I wouldn't say it is necessary to read this duology, but I do not know anything about future NJO books, so it is probably best to read it. [It is probably best to read every one.] Overall it is a fast-paced, exciting novel."
4,The NJO Revived,"I was disappointed when Dark Journey came out, and now that three horrible books have been published (Dark Tide and DJ), I began to lose my faith in the series, and I would have, if not for Star by Star and Balance Point.Now, it seems a great book appears right before I decide to junk the entire series. Reminescent of his X-Wing novels, Allston delivers an action-packed book.The characters come more vivdly, and the battles are described thoroughly. The entire plot if great.However, even if this may be one of the best books in the NJO, there sre still many flaws.Mara, for instance, seems like a weakling more than a Jedi Master. There is absolutely NO trace of the dark side in Jaina, whereas it seems she has transformed into a complete angel.I would've given this novel five stars, if Allston had done a better job at developing the newer characters, and if it had been a tad longer. Hope he does a better job on his next one, since i am looking forward to it."
2,surprisingly bad,"In all honesty, I have not finished reading this book. I will finish it, and I will finish it quickly. I doubt I will have any problems with the story itself, but it is an excruciating read. It is so poorly written that I am constantly distracted. I just want to call Del Rey and ask to speak to the person who edited this book. I suspect no such person exists. It reads like a poor translation into English from some other language. Maybe Allston wrote it in Latin and took it over to his local highschool to have it translated. It makes me angry because the fans deserve better. Because it is so badly written, I have to say it's the worst Star Wars novel I've read to date, and I've read around 40. Don't read it if you don't have to."
5,Exellent Book,This is really good book just like all the other Star Wars books! I reccomend before you read this one though you read the ones before in the series.
3,"Just kind of ""meh""","This book, and it's followup, aren't bad books. Aaron Allston's writing is good, as are his characterizations; the big problem for me is the era it's set in. I'm not a big fan of the Yuuzhan Vong war storyline, and mostly bought this book and it's followup because of the promise of Wraith Squadron and Wedge Antilles. I'd buy it used."
5,Excellent filter to replace cp-e filter for RDX intake kit...,I measured out the originally cp-e filter that came with my 2007 Acura RDX intake kit and found that this was closest to the original filter. Works like a charm and I don't have to clean my filter as often. Thanks k&n!
4,Faberge Poster Book,"This 11 x 16 ""poster size"" book contains 26 full page color plates of a few of Peter Carl Faberge's masterpieces. On the adjoining page You will find the dimensions, a detailed description and sometimes a note of interest. Makes a nice coffee table book- just enough info to wet your appetite. Great Photos!"
5,If only you could eat like this everyday,"I first checked this book out of the library and then I bought it. The recipes are fabulous, and I have tried more than half. The ingredients can be difficult to find. At times, I have resorted to the internet to find some obscure ingredients, but I have not been disappointed with a single dish yet. They are really one-of-a-kind five star creations. Im making the Jade Rice recipe again tonight for company."
2,disappointed with a recent movie purchase,"I was so happy to be able to order the bachelors flat movie. However, when I received it, it skips and I was so disappointed. I looked for the movie for years, so I decided to keep it and watch it anyway. I wish it didn't skip."
3,Weaker than her usual,"Generally Jensen is nightmarish, haunting, and a weaver of excellent books. Here this tends to lean more toward teenage shock, with weaker character development, predictable turn arounds, and a truly horrible final ending. Otherwise, though,the book is hard to put down and works well enough to keep the reader...reading."
3,It Does Keep You Interested,"This is only my 2nd R.J. Jensen book. She writes books geared for ages 10-14. Not that there is anything wrong w/that. If I had read this in middle-school, it might have given me nightmares. It gets a 4 because of the horror it does bring on as you read and she doesn't need slasher, gore, grotesque disfigurement to scare you. However the development of characters & certain situations are rather weak. (:"
5,15 years ago today,"Halloween 81, can't wait. Just got done listening to the 88 tapes from Beacon Theater, Broadway The Hardway Feb 4th,5th, and 6th 1988 That was 15 years ago today and I was there too all three days! So how surprised to do some surfing and find out a DVD of the 81 show is released today! Too cool! Having been at the 81 shows also I can't wait to watch it again! I'll give it 5 of 5 just for the release!"
2,"Realistic animation, light and sound.","Very expensive, over priced - to expensive for what it is. Book is interesting in content. Delivery was reasonable but the book arrived in a damaged condition."
3,Not for the shooter.,"This is probably a good book for collectors - history, statistical data, military application (how to shoot what, how an officer has to inspect the weapon, etc.,) Mostly things that are not relevant to today's sports shooting. It's probably because this manual is direct translation of a Russian field manual, which was issued (only in theory, most soldiers have never seen it) as a SUPPLEMENT to training. It was not meant as a stand-alone ""teach yourself"" type of book. Yes, there are disassembly and cleaning chapters, but any free information I've found on the web was better and more detailed with better illustration.Just last night I had to disassemble my new SKS and remove storage grease, lube and re-assemble. I found this manual LEAST helpful out of all information sources I had."
2,Not that helpful,"This is a translation of the Russian manual for the SKS carbine. It notes that disasembly and cleaning should be done under the supervision of a squad leader and, maybe even an officer. When I read that, I was surprised as the typical US soldier - after basic and advanced training on the M-16 - is left much more to his/her own devices.After trying to take the weapon down, I realized why that caveat was included. The few line drawings included are not detailed enough for the process to be fully understood. More so, there are also some omissions about what is involved in taking apart the gas recoil system. Having an advantage over the notional Private Yuri, I went online to obtain enough information to handle the disassembly/cleaning/assembly process.If you are unfamiliar with this weapon, you need to find something more comprehensive otherwise you will put youself at risk of damaging your SKS."
4,"Solid, Entertaining Mitchum Western","Young Billy Young is a reliably entertaining Western with a stolid, solid performance as Robert Mitchum as a veteran lawman who takes a job as a town marshal to settle an old score. along the way, he runs into Billy Young, a wet-behind-thge ears gunfighter who's nursing his own grudge, having been left behind after a killing by his riding partner, played by David Carradine. Young is played by Robert Walker with earnestness and genuiness. And soon, Mitchum and Walker's characters are working together to right wrongs and settle scores. Throw Angie Dickinson in as a saloon girl with a heart of gold, and Paul Fix as a crusty old stage driver, and you've got the makings of a Western standard.Young Billy Young is pretty standard, from the sometimes cliched dialogue to the plot, but Mitchum holds everything together with the strength of his charm and personality. This is a good film that is very watchable."
3,More like album liner notes than a real book,"I purchased this book for our high school library hoping to have at least one good introduction to Bob Marley for our students. While it will do the job, it's more of a photo-essay from the last two years of his life, accompanied by a biographical article that reads more like album liner notes.I was hoping for more description of the music, how it evolved, what it's about and how it was received. I was hoping for a more detailed chronology of his life, not just a recitation of names and events.Having said that, this book is better than nothing to get our readers interested in Marley. It'll do."
5,ITS SO WONDERFULL READING THE BOOK,MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS THAT THOS BOOK REALLY POTRAYS CLEARLY THE LIFE OF A LEGEND.
4,Great study guide!,This book has 5 different tests. Each with the answer sheet in the back. The answer sheet explains why each answer is correct. This is imperative to know. I passed the FL state exam on my first try. I can highly recommend this study guide.
1,nursing assistance/nurse aide exam (second edition),"I ordered two books at the same time needed both,got one book and the other I waited for weeks and e-mailed xxx3.Amazon does not have the book any more,don't sell this book.Not in stock and can not get it.If I would of know I would not have ordered the other book.P.S. when ordering better make sure they have the book,they'll show the book but they might not have it any more.I'm very disapointed."
1,Wrong product sent.,"The description of this USB cable to the Minolta Digital Camera G400 said it was compatible with, among other kinds, the Minolta G500 series. This is not true. I had to return the product and was not reimbursed for the shipping. I'm very dissatisfied!"
5,Excellent!,"I highly recommend this book. For those of you that can read French, you are in for a treat! Many of these poems and stories I read over 10 years ago, but they are still fresh and poignant in my mind. My favorite is Guy de Maupaussant. This is definitely worth the investment. French poetry and stories are special in the sense that the writers have examined themselves on a philosophical level. It almost seems as if each writer is trying to teach you something worthwhile. If you can read German, there is another book like this one by the same company that is also dual language. Relax and enjoy a sample of the French literary world. Note: the translations are not exact. It is highly recommended that you read it in the original language."
4,"Attractive, functional","Very nice, we're enjoying the ability to use our patio this fall. Produces good heat but like others I've seen the warmth decreases significantly as soon as there's any wind. The directions are not very good. Specifically you need to remove the plastic receptacle attached to the base and fill it with sand, then place the brackets that will later hold the propane tank, THEN re-attach the receptacle before beginning assembly where the instructions begin. Only other criticism is my fault, I did not measure the space because I have seen many outdoor heaters and had a reasonable idea what size they are. This unit is taller and wider than others I've seen and barely fits my space."
5,Great Product,I ordered these heat lamps for a huge party I was throwing. They came on time and looked great. Very Easy to use and easy to move around the patio (when moving to storage). Highly recommend these if you are looking for heat lamps. Great bang for the buck!
5,Easy to Assemble and Operate,"I was able to assemble this in about forty five minutes at a leisurely pace. The instructions were accurate and helpful. The box comes with a wrench for the nuts used to assemble the heater. In addition you will need a phillips head screwdriver and two adjustable wrenches or end wrenches to connect the gas regulator to the gas hose. It worked the first time I tried to light it and seems to kick out a fair amount of heat. I can not speak to how long this will last, although my experience is that these heaters have a life span of about five years."
1,How long do we have to wait?,"""It's now been exactly one year since this cd was supposed to be released and it still isn't available! What's even worse is there is no advance notice or update as to when it will be released. This is an outrage! I wish that DRT would get on the ball and finally release it. Do all of we GG fans a favor; please!"""
1,Where Is It?,"Pushed back yet again to summer 2006. It is now May and still no word on when this release will actually exist and hit the market. Why oh why please God help me!Edited Sept 12, 2007. Still not released. I suppose it never will be, and what a shame."
2,awful. too bad they couldn't keep the series going,"The first book was excellent, and this one a major dissappointment. Pharaun has lost all his wit, Ryld has turned into a cardboard character and Quentel can sit in for the wicked witch of the west (her whip doesn't even make snide remarks anymore). The Dreagloth has turned into some kind of good samaritan and Ched Nasad isn't an amusing locale as backdrop. To add to all this, combats are skipped over instead of described in all their gory, spell throwing pyrokinetic glory. Who would skip combat descriptions in a FR novel?? This is where I get off the War of the Spider Queen train."
3,Interesting but ultimately lacking.,"While the plot twist and turns are right up there with the best. The lack of description of the fight scenes is disheartening. Perhaps I was spoiled by the Drizzt tales, but these books are surely lacking in the feeling of actually being immersed in the battles."
4,Drow Lovers PLZ read,This book takes off from where the first left you.If the series continues like this I think I have some new authors to start reading.There is chaos everywhere!!!!Creatures of all sorts are in this book.It never gets slow.
5,Bukowski will beat you all!,"This is a good example of audience participation.The first few minutes the camera is blocked by someone later the catcalls and smartasses really start in on poor Chuck.But he rebuts & rebukes them in his inimitable style.You can see why he gave up public readings soon after this one,a classic!"
3,Out dated but still fun,If your someone looking for a book to help you out with your skating I would not reccommend this book. But for the obcessive skateboard freak who likes most anything to do with it I'd say check this out because it's funny and you can just open it anytime and get a glimse at what skateboarding used to be all about. It should have featured more pro's though. Only a few pic's of the old masters but plenty of tricks you wouldent want to learn from these guy's perspective.
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I was expecting more from this WMV-HD. The movie is High resolution, but the sound is terrible. I wonder who mixed this. Cracking noises in the 21st century, unbelievable."
2,Quirky song selections mar outing,"Percy Faith leaves behind his signature lush string sound and replaces it with plenty of brass and woodwind. The opening track the Entertainer is orchestral overkill. In fact the cumbersome arrangement over takes the song and midway through the selection the melody is lost. I'm Gonna Go Fishin is equally bombastic. The other album included in this two-fer is Faith's discoed update of the Theme from a Summer Place. Need one say more? There are some good tracks: What'll I Do, Chinatown and Midnight at Oasis all carry Faith's distinctive style. And we also get a vocal thrown in for good measure. A lack of liner notes that specifically discusses these albums is a let down."
1,Battery was dead!,"I purchased this thermometer based on the good reviews. However, just a few months after receipt, we needed to use it during vacation. We tried turning it on and it was dead, couldn't get it to turn on. We never used itprior to, and had it stored in our medicine cabinet. The battery included must have been almost dead when we received it, because we tested it once, and then put it away. We were very disappointed that the first time we needed it, it didn't work."
1,Great until it stops working,I got this before my son was born due to it having very positive reviews. My son is now 7 months old and we have used it maybe a total of 5 times and it stopped working. It was very frustrating to have a sick baby and not be able to take his temp. So the next day I went and bought a new battery thinking that would solve the problem. However it still did not work. I am now shopping for a new thermometer after having this one for only 7 months. I am very disappointed and will not be buying another Vicks product.
1,Thermometer completely dead,"I probably should have tested this as soon as I received it. I opened up the package just last night to check my daughters temp, and it was completely dead; wouldn't turn on. I'm a little annoyed since I can return or exchange it. A complete waste of money."
3,Cofusing to use,It's not as easy to use as I would like. I wish it was just a matter of turning it on.
1,Not Accurate,The temperature reading is different every time even when using multiple times consecutively. It is not reliable for when reliability is needed most.
4,Good Thermometer,Easy to use. I like the little cap that it comes with. Easy to keep clean. Now ill never have to question if this was a rectal or oral use haha
5,So fast! Extremely helpful,"Given this was the first thermometer I purchased for my 4 month old son, I knew it worked well but had nothing to compare too. Two months later, I misplaced it and ended up using a general thermometer rectally to check my son's temperature. It felt like it took forever to get a reading! The Vicks Baby Rectal Thermometer is very fast, and like others have mentioned, it ensures that a temperature taking ""rookie"" don't put the end in too far. Highly recommend!"
5,Piece of Mind,I can't see having a baby and not having a rectal thermometer to check your baby for fevers and if you give baby medicine you can follow up to ensure the fever is reducing. Must Have
3,Worked great until it was washed,"The thermometer worked fine until we went to clean it in the sink. You only have maybe 1"" of probe until it reaches the display part, which isn't water proof. I'm not sure the best way to clean it but using soap and water in the sink isn't it."
2,It doesn't work,"I bought this item on May 8th. When I received it I tried to check whether it works or not. Unfortunately, I was not able to turn it on. The product is defective."
1,dont buy it,After the first couple of uses this thing never gave me a reliable temperature. It was always a few degrees below what it ought to have been. Get one that works!
2,worked at first,"I like the design of this thermometer, it has a short, flexible tip which is nice when you are nervous using a rectal thermometer on your newborn. In the begining I think it gave accurate readings and worked well, but lately it seems very off (by more than a degree). I am now looking for a new thermometer that works! Its too bad becuase it gets so many rave reviews, not from us though."
1,Not a good product,"Af far as I can tell in comparison with three other thermometers, this thermometer is not accurate and is quite slow."
1,Didn't work,"Got it from Amazon before the baby was born. We needed it the very first time to control our baby temperature on a Bilibed when the newborn was diagnosed with jaundice. The min temp we were told to keep was 97. Surprise - 97+-1 degree all the time, mostly 97.1 rectal. Baby hated the procedure. Under arms (you can use it that way per the manual - 96. It was about 11 pm, baby was crying, our idea was she is cold. Tried under arms on myself and got 95.9. Run to a local 24 hr store, got Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer (Amazon sells is as well) and can't be happier. Baby doesn't even notice I use that one. Vicks is going to trash."
1,failed,I only used this once before it stopped working!!! replaced the batteries and still didnt work.. very disappointed. It was a real bummer when I needed it at 3am and trying to figure out if my newborn had a fever and it didnt work. :(
4,"Good thermometer, not waterproof","We have been through numerous more expensive thermometers that give inaccurate temperature readings. This one seems to work well. Our only complaint is that when you wash it off, it's easy to get water in the battery compartment or in the LCD display which causes the thermometer to stop working. This has happened twice now but thankfully it starts working again after drying out. I wish they had made it totally waterproof since it's easy to get water inside. Our infant son doesn't seem to mind this thermometer at all, he doesn't fuss when we use it."
1,"""Waterproof for easy cleaning"" Ah... Nope!","Vick's website proudly claims that this thermometer is ""waterproof for easy cleaning.""The digital display began to malfunction after its first rinse.I washed the ""probe tip"" under the faucet.The thermometer was never submerged underwater."
4,"Good product, but be careful cleaning it","It's well-designed and gives a quick reading. However, the battery door is not gasketed, so when washing the thermometer, it's easy for water to get into the unit; then parts inside corrode and it quits working. Still the best out of several that we've tried, I'm buying another one."
4,As good as it gets for newborns,"We just purchased our second Baby Rectal Thermometer for our second baby. It's pretty much the ideal rectal thermometer for new parents and newborns. The design takes away any fear that you might ""go too far"" and it gives a quick, accurate reading."
1,Battery was dead,"We received it, opened the package and it was dead. Turned out the battery was dead.New battery costs $7 from radio shack.Not happy with this purchase at all."
5,Does the Job,"I like the fact that it's specifically made for the rectum, so you can never go too far (Which as a new parent, freaks me out!). You get the readings relatively quick, which I also like, because my baby gets quite squirmy. I would recommend this if you're looking for a rectal thermometer."
2,Went through 3 in 9 months!,"You would think I have learned my lesson after 2, but based on the good reviews I just thought I had bad luck.The thermometer is good when it works. I found it was very accurate compared to the forehead one I have.The problem is it doesn't work for long. Each one lasted about 2 months. Then the screen just had a strikethrough across it instead of numbers."
2,not sure about this one.,I bought this thermometer after reading the positive reviews on amazon. Not sure. Used it once. Felt it was hard to use and cumbersome..and baby did not like it all.so we went back to the ear thermometer. got just about the same readings as the rectal thermometer and baby is a lot more comfortable.
2,Stopped Working,"We really liked this thermometer however it stopped working after only 4 months. As Murphy's Law would have it, it was when we were on vacation and our son was running a fever. We got an error code. I called the customer service line to find out the error code meant ""internal error"" AKA permanently broken. I could have mailed it in for a replacement however it is still sitting on my desk. Maybe one of these days I'll actually get it mailed."
1,Gave false readings- maybe we got a dud?,"We bought this thermometer for the good reviews. Then one night, we had called our pediatrician's office since our baby's temp was registering lower than 96 degrees with this. We checked rectally 3 times and under his arm with this to be sure we were getting an accurate reading- all were below 96 degrees, prompting our Dr to advise us to take the baby to the emergency room immediately. Once there, they checked his temp and it was completely normal at 97.5 degrees. They said our thermometer was probably a dud and to try a new one. Had this worked properly, we could've avoided the incredible stress and frustration we experienced with false readings. Maybe we just got a dud, so if you buy this then please be sure you have another thermometer as back-up to double-check any worrisome readings."
2,Not accurate,"We have had this thermometer for more than a year. It has consistently read very low and we sort of have to guess if the baby has a fever or not based on if it is higher than it usually reads (about 95). However, I am hoping it is just a lemon and am buying another one since there don't seem to be any other rectal thermometers with decent reviews! To its credit, it is very easy to use."
2,battery case sucks,"I was really excited to use this after all the glowing reviews I read. First try, with baby feverish -- major failure. First, the batteries were dead after less than a month with only one quick test use. Maybe my fault. But still -- I go to change the battery and I can't get the little blue cover off. I used a nickel, I used a flathead screwdriver, a quarter, etc ..... After many tried the cover got stuck in a half-open position and was JAMMED for good. There was no way to get it of this little plastic piece of crap. Why is everything made of cheap plastic these days?! The thing was rendered useless and out it went onto the heap of other plastic crap that is going to someday overtake our world."
4,"Fast, Accurate, Easy","I don't have much to add over the other reviews here - but this thermometer is very fast, seems to be much more accurate (readings are consistent over multiple attempts), and our son doesn't even realize what we're doing. We were initially against the 'rectal' route, but that was mostly based on old prejudices against really long, really slow older models (that we grew up with).This thermometer has a very short probe (no worries about going too far), and he has yet to even notice what we're doing. And it reads in 10 seconds or less, which is great because you're trying to get a temperature when he's screaming and crying. The armpit model we used before took up to 60 seconds, which is an eternity when he's thrashing and you're trying to hold the probe under his (thrashing) arm.All in all, works fantastic, it's pretty cheap, and we don't have to dread getting a temp!"
1,Works great until it doesn't,"We purchased this thermometer in August 2011, prior to our baby being born. We've used it a couple times, and it was very easy and quick to use. On October 12th, we tried to use it and received an error message (""Err"") instead of a temperature. Tried turning it on and off, even removing and then replacing the battery to reset it; no luck. Unfortunately, we're outside Amazon's 30 day return period, so we are contacting Vick's directly to try and obtain a refund. Obviously, we are very disappointed at how poorly this product lasted."
4,Best thermometer I've used for a baby/toddler,As a new Mom I was so afraid to take my baby's temperature...that I might hurt her or put it in too far. Then I saw this thermometer and couldn't get over how easy it was to use. I have found it to be very accurate.It gives great peace of mind.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't believe the hype about this cheap useless thermometer. I bought this one so I would have a reliable accurate thermometer which would produce fast accurate results. What I got was two readings before it broke. It doesn't always light up and now its stuck at 96.8. I removed and reinserted the battery and it is still broken. Also, there are no probe covers that will fit this product so you will have to continue to sanitize with alcohol. Nice gimmick- like product that DID NOT WORK when I had an emergency. In the end, I went to the grocery store at 10 at night to get one that worked when this one froze up."
5,best,"after 3 different thermometers, i finally got one we loved. as a new mom, you want this done as quickly as possible without being afraid that you are inserting the tip too far. i think this is a must have for every parent."
2,Display stopped to work,"I really like the design of this device so I am giving it two stars. But the thermometer's display stopped to work after probably the 10th use when my son fell sick after another RSV episode at day care. When you have a crying, sick baby and your only rectal thermometer broke, life became a challenge., I had a difficult time to use my auxiliary thermometer to take his temp. It was not as accurate, and doctors do not like any reading other than the ones from rectal ones. So I was kinda suck. I have been careful in cleaning the tip, and really have no idea why it broke. I wonder if I should get another one because I do like the ease of use of this device. But ... Maybe I should look for another baby rectl thermometer."
1,Stopped giving accurate readings.,I'm not sure how the reviews for this product are as good as they are. It worked fine for a few months but then stopped giving accurate reviews. 92 degrees? I don't think so. We are on our third one and they have all failed in this manner. This is always after multiple triple checks and after months of accurate readings so in case anyone was wondering it is not user error. I find this unsafe and dangerous.
2,Half 'n' half,"Polly Bergen's output is starting to come out on CD, thanks to the Collectables label. She is an exceptional song stylist, so I considered each new CD released an automatic buy -- until now.I like the fact that companies like Collectables are squeezing two albums onto one CD, but in cases like this, it's a mistake.The first half, the Polly and Her Pop album, sounds entirely -- and I do mean entirely -- different from the second half. This album is almost unlistenable, in my book. It's badly arranged pseudo-country and should have been left in the vaults. As it is, Bergen's father is really the main vocalist on these songs and she's essentially a background vocal, and that's not a recommendation.The second half is much like the Polly Bergen you'll hear in the other two-album CD sets by Collectables, and that means she's great. But it's not enough. I'd recommend buying the other two Collectables sets and skipping this one."
3,Good but out of date,"Good for its time but published in the mid-1990s. Sumo changed most radically after that, and the only way to really understand sumo is to buy a much more recent text. Search Kindle."
4,Pretty Funny,"Although I bought it used, it was a very good copy, and in tact. Tommy Davidson and Joe Torre very funny. Their segments were short though. Some of the comedians were okay, and roast was rather short. But if you like Shaquille, then you would want to see this. Other than that, Flavor Flavs roast was funnier."
2,So bad that it ends up being watchable,I think the idea here had great potential but the execution just wasn't there. They should have focused on finding experienced roasters and not just random black comedians from the last 15 years. Some of the guys bomb so bad that it is worth watching just to see how flat the jokes fall. . . But the best review for this was written by the Sports Guy Bill Simmons a few years ago[...]I enjoyed the 2nd Shaq roast where Emmitt Smith was the honoree.
4,Fun camera,"Great camera for a cam with average lens @ 1/1.8.As others have reviewed, the AF is troublesome. But after I disabled the AREA AUTOFOCUS and left the AUTO FOCUS ENABLED, I found that problem ceased to exist. I also got 2 after market batteries for 4.98 a piece 1000MAh and they last a very long time."
3,sadly disappointed,"My previous Nikon (Coolpix 3700) took fantastic pictures, sharp, clear...top notch. This 5200, although it is more comfortable to handle because it's a better fit in my hands, has been a huge disappointment because it doesn't seem to ever have good focus. I'm an average photographer who would've thought it was my own fault, but having had such excellent results with my previous Nikon, the 3700, I think it must have something to do with this model...or I got a lemon."
2,Nikon Coolpix 5200 needs help!!!,"This camera of beautiful design and manufacture is not up to par with its Canon S400/S500 peers. The quality of the pictures leaves a lot to be desired with respect to clear/sharp focus, white balance and noise levels.Indoor photos are especially noisy and this becomes evident any time you try to print sizes over 5X7"" (not too big).I have seen lots of prints from Canon S400 cameras that beat the crap out of this Coolpix. Even after sharpening on post-processing software the photos are still not up to par. Fuzzy/soft pictures are the norm and crisp pictures will be more of a rare occurence. Few manual controls definitely don't help to overcome any of the issues.Nikon has definitely dropped the ball on this one!"
3,Last Coolpix for me,"I started with the Coolpix 4300 but it was painfully slow and temperamental.So I upgraded to the 5200, which I loved to put in my pocket and snap away with, as a simpler alternative to my D70. After a year or two, though, the 5200 would start up with a black screen about half the time. I have to restart it and restart it in the hope that it will get back into working mode. My theory is that this is due to grit getting in the zoom barrel, so my next purchase has been the Pentax W20, which has internal zoom. It seems like that or the two-lens, no-external-zoom Kodak V610 are better choices these days."
4,Very nice,"The new Nikon 5200 is much more compact and elegant than its predecessors. The first thing that struck me was the smooth design compared with the rather chunky 3700, 4300 and 2100. The main reason is the new grip and battery compartment - a vast improvement. The pictures are faultless for amateur use, the lens is above average (somewhat distorted in the edge), much better than the Canon 500, and on par with the Pentax 555.The menu system is very intuitive and easy and most importantly the recycle time is comparable to normal cameras - it has always annoyed me when I have to wait for a digital camera to be ready for the `Kodak moment', no such problems with this Nikon. The only fault I have come across is the rather weak flash."
5,Fast!,"This is an excellent camera!I particularly like the speed of wich it takes picures in the ""sports"" mode. No other cameras I have experience with is anywhere close to its 2,5 pics per second (you'll probably need a good quality SLR to match this). If you, like me, plan to take action pictures (skiing, etc.), no other compact camera is better.The picture quality is very good, and the ""red eye-fixer"" is working allmost perfectly (I think I've seen red eyes ONCE during my first couple of hundred pics). The user friendlyness is also very good, logical and easy to understand, even for me that have little prior experience with Nikon.The only downside with the camera is the screen size which does not match many of today's new cameras. Besides the size the screen is good, with excellent visibility in most situations. And in my opinion, cameras are constructed to TAKE pictures, slide shows should be on your tv or computer.."
2,Night mode not good,"night mode is always blurry,without tripod its hard to take night time pictures. daytime pictures are very good."
1,just really bad pictures,"After my last Nikon, which I really liked, had some problems with the zoom lens opening, I set out to find another camera. I really don't like change, so I looked for another Nikon with which I could use my rechargeable ion batteries and SD card. I chose the Nikon 5200. Bad choice. Maybe I just got a lemon? Not sure, but what I do know is that this camera takes the worst pictures. Practically impossible to get a clear, focused picture inside, and when I do get a picture that is technically focused, it just isn't very sharp. I recently took it on a beach vacation and got all my pictures back with an aura around the white things in the pictures (hair bow, sunhat, etc.). Let's see... bad inside, bad outside. Verdict? Just bad."
4,Suitable for teenager,"Gift was enjoyed by 13 and 14 year old siblings. The delivery service was terrible. I suggest you find another source as this was not the first time I have made purchases from Amazon and I have always been satisfied, but it was the first time I used this outsource. Never again Cametta Camera."
2,Software did not work,"This camera took fine pictures, but the software didn't work. I was told by Nikon tech support that software problems were common and maybe ""they rushed this product to market"". The software wouldn't let me crop,reduce red eye or catalog photos as it was supposed to do. I returned to camera for a refund. An altogether frustrating experience. Don't buy."
2,Great Pictures--Sometimes,"While seemingly well-built, this camera was returned after a few weeks of use. After using Canon's for years, this camera took great picutres, when they weren't blurry or over/under exposed. There are too many settings that change the white balance, etc. that made shooting quick photos a pain. Movies worked well until you played them back (only in quick time), but were choppy and crackly. Recycling between pictures took forever, so you missed a lot of shots. The red-eye-reducer did not work at all. I fiddled with it until I had enough. I returned it and got a Canon SD300. No hassles, no adjustments, just point-and-shoot for great picutres."
3,"OK, not great, product",The price was very good but the quality of the microfiber towels is not as good as some slightly higher priced brands like Cobra.
5,Great Towel,This towel works really well and does not leave water spots after washing your car. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a perfect drying product.
4,dries my car,"I liked this towel. One towel is all you need for one car because it's so large. The size also makes it easy to wring out. I'd caution that the material is a bit rough and nothing like microfiber -- which still shouldn't scratch your car.Only con that I found was that after using this towel twice, the material is displaying signs of age. Hopefully this doesn't affect performance in the future."
5,Excellent drying towel!,"While I don't necessary condone drying cars with a towel (micro-marring, even with microfiber), this is an awesome one that should (for the most part) keep your car safe from any debris that might be left on there as you dry. Remember to blot not swipe! Wring out the towel often and visually and physically inspect for dirt and debris. I usually wash after a use and keep it in a sealed (clean) 5 gallon bucket so no dirt/debris gets in. You will inevitably have to wring this out a couple times while drying a car, but that can't be a negative? You want a towel twice the size go for it - but you'll be touching that to the ground or wheel or something else accidentally drawing up some dirt with it. The size and functionality of this is perfect, I highly recommend this product."
5,Great drying towel,"These are great towels. I don't understand some of the negative reviews, you CAN wring them out when they get really wet and they DO dry very well. It typically takes two or three of these to fully dry my 2011 Silverado Crew Cab, including the bed cover. I use two at a time...one to get most of the water and the other to get any excess that's left behind. They work so well that I bought two more so that if I wash both the truck and the car, I always have a dry one.Highly recommended."
5,Excellent towel,I bought these magic towel for my husband. He uses an Autoglym silicone blade first then this Water Magnet. He was very happy with the towel. He said we should have bought them earlier. Easy to wring dry after absorbing so so much water. Highly recommended. You won't go wrong with this one.
4,Very Nice but one is not enough.,This towel is a real soaker and it pat dries very nicely. Although I disagree that one is enough even for a smaller sedan style car. Two seem to work out great for my jetta sportwagen.
3,Blue ones are bigger/better,"Works ok, but is smaller size than the blue ones offered here on Amazon. Due to the size difference the Blue ones are a much better value."
1,Not worth buying,You are better off using an old fashioned shami that never needs wringing out and doesn't leave water spots like this towel does. I regret buying it.
3,Not Bad and Does the Job,"This towel is fair; however it does not compare with the Cobra Guzzler HD Waffle Weave Drying Towel available from autogeek[...]. It you want a towel that does with it says it will do, then this is the one. I can do my entire SUV with this one towel. There is none better that I know of and I have tried many different towels."
2,Meguiar's Water Magnet Drying Towel,"It started out impressively. But over time, its performance deteriorated. The best drying towels out there are the Water Sprite Plus. They are made in Holland. They are more expensive, but I've yet to find a better performer so I guess I'll stick with that."
5,Does the job.,"I have tried most products out there, but what I liked about this one was the excellent absorption. One towel can do the job perfectly, without leaving streaks in my car."
2,Gets hard and no longer useable after a few uses,"I bought a few of these to dry my cars because they seem to be a good value. Although they do absorb a lot of water and supple when they were new, after about ten uses and washes these towels became hard and I no longer feel comfortable drying my paint with these towels. When washing these towels I always treat them as I do to my normal microfiber towels - machine wash cold, Chemical Guys microfiber detergent with no fabric softeners and normal dry in the dryer with no dryer sheets. These towels are now demoted to drying outside windows, wheels/tires and stuff that dont tend to scratch easily."
4,Nice product - works as advertised,"This is a simple product designed to do a simple job.It does what it's suppose to and does it well.Is it a miracle cloth, no. Is it a good cloth to wipe down a car after a wash, yes.Buy two - one to wipe up the wetness, one to follow with."
5,Perfect car Towel,"Soft and really soaks up the water, and it rings out easy. Its perfect. The only thing that would make it better would be a hard case to carry it in."
2,NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A CHAMOIS,THIS IS OKAY AS A TOWEL. IT GETS FULL OF WATER FAIRLY FAST. I'VE USED IT TWICE NOW AND GONE BACK TO MY CHAMOIS.
2,Oh! Please,"Meguiar's calls this a towel, give me a break. It is less than half the size of the one's I bought from Groit's and less than half the thickness. All and all you could use them to handle the in side of the car but as for drying the out side ... ??Meguiar's wax - good stuff and the towels not so much."
4,Re-discover Bournonville,"Bournonville ( appointed choreographer to Royal Danish Ballet in early 1800 ) is better known for the 2nd version of La Sylphide(1836),the 1st being the P.Taglioni's (1832) ideally revived by Lacotte as a tribute to the legendary Maria Taglioni, in 1971.Ballet mostly on demi-pointe,as peculiar in Bournonville,is strikingly light and exquisite especially in the ""pas de six"" where the dancers show their danish technique.Quite enjoyable."
1,Danish Ballet is sad,"I'd heard so much about the briliant triditions of Danish Ballet, but I was speechless when I watched Napoli on LD quite some time ago. It is like watching a beginners class, the members of corps de ballet are tall, short, chubby or skinny, none of them looks like a ballet dancer. The leading roles are terrible dancers as well. Before I started to write this, I took it out and watched again, it was a torture.If you don't want to waste your money, don't buy it. But if you are curious about Danish ballet, buy it to see how bad it can be. My experiences tells me not to buy any performances from small countries because they just don't have the resources to put up a good show. Buy things from Paris Opera Ballet, Kirov, Boshoi, ABT and Royal Ballet, the quality is usually ensured."
2,Biased,"I would like to attract your attention to the online polls that Time Magazine did before issuing this book. In these polls, in two different categories (one of them is Leaders & Revolutionaries), the voters chose Ataturk who is not only the founder of Turkish Republic but also an idol for all countries that had been living as colonies of industrialized countries. Another inconsistency about this mistake is that Time Magazine declared that The Foundation of Turkish Republic (October 23, 1923) is one of the biggest days of ""80 Days that changed the world"" (another collector's edition book). They selected this event as that much important but did not add it in this book. It is incomprehensible."
1,Large number of major errors made these books unusable,Don't make the mistake I did in assuming the second edition would surely have errors corrected from previous editions. Since this is a shrink-wrapped set you cannot determine the printing history of each book before you buy the set. Coriolis customer service would not even return my calls leading me to believe they know they have a lemon on the shelf and refuse to replace error-riddled sets. They've lost their credibility with these books.
2,Too much extraneous info to use for cram sessions,"I used Exam Cram for my recent A Plus exams as well one of my MCSE exams. I don't use them anymore because they are just too long. Besides being hundreds of pages too long, there is a lot of non-essential material you have to wade through. My game plan for all the exams I have taken has been to first study Sybex, then take some practice tests, then two days before the exam, use my notes and up until recently, Exam Cram to cram for the exam. But now I use O'Rielly's MCSE Core (or Electives) in a Nutshell because it is so concise. Exam Cram books, most of which are over 400 pages, are just too lengthy to be used for last minute cram sessions. One reason to buy them: they are written in a lively, irreverent and occaisionally humerous manner that makes them an easier read than some MCSE materials."
3,Very poor quality control on test CD,"The Work station book was good but the server book was not worth the time. However the most frustrating thing about it was that the tests on the CD were very poorly reviewed, especially the number two tests. Each had well over a dozen errors on them. Most of them were so simple to catch as on a multiple choice question it only allows you to pick one answer. If so little time and effort was put into the tests it makes me wonder about the rest of the matterial."
5,Excellent books,"I read the networking essentials and in two days I took the exam and passed with ""flying colors"". I recommend these books for anyone wishing to become certifed."
2,One great single and a lot of filler,"First Class were singer-for-hire Tony Burrows (Edison Lighthouse, Flying Machine, Brotherhood of Man) and studio musicians. Apart from ""Beach Baby"", an inspirred bit of Beach Boys pastiche that sounded great on the radio in 1974, the rest is pretty much middling fare. You'll find ""Beach Baby"" and an additional First Class track or two in better company on ""Bubblegum Classics, Vol. 5""."
3,Good light nostalgia for us 60's and 70s era pre-teens :),"I loved the song ""Beach Baby"" and still love it now.I had never heard any of the other songs, but I enjoyed them just the same. What can you say the songs are a product of the ""bubblegum"" times, and that's ok. Everything doesn't have to have the Rolling Stone Magazine stamp of approval. For some of us women of a ""certain age"" it's definitely a guilty pleasure...some of the songs are kind of like vintage (70s era) Rick Springfield,the New Vaudeville Band or even the Beach Boys...all performers I enjoy to this very day."
5,Twelve Weeks to Fertility,"With all the ART treatments and acupuncture ,still no baby. The missing link was the stress and our mind/body connections. We are now happily 6mos pregnant. This book helped both of us deal with it all and prepare for a truly healthy pregnancy in every way. Very special book. Cindy and Jack"
1,Got wrong item,They sent me the wrong book and told me that they would reprocess the order but I still have not recieved the correct item (that they were processing a month ago).
2,waste of time,Most people buying fertility books are usually having fertility issues that can't be fixed in twelve weeks. Do yourself a favor and find out your real issue at a doctor's office.
5,Really Positive!,"There is a card for everyone in here, and gentle reminders to love ourselves and be kind to ourselves as we learn and grow."
3,well-being cards,"I have other cards that are similar by Louise Hay and I think I expected these to be as good, but they're not. They don't seem to evoke the same response and generate the same conversation potential in a group. I receive daily notes from Abraham-Hicks and thought these cards would follow that same pattern of wisdom in brief doses."
5,Well-Being Cards,I Love these cards. I leave them sitting out on my table and read one most days to remind me to watch where my attention lies. Very positive and uplifting.
1,NOT WORTH IT.,If I could've I wouldn't given it a minus 5 stars. I DIDNT GET PAST FIRST CHAPTER. FORGET THAT B.S. IT WAS SO DAMN SICKENING. SHE GETS RAPED BY A KING WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER HUSBAND. N FALLS IN LOVE WITH A WITNESS WHO HELPS THE KING RAPE HER REPEATEDLY UNTIL SHE GETS PREGO. HOW THE HELL WAS THIS EVEN ALLOWED TO BE PRINTED OUT N LABELED AS A ROMANCE NOVEL??? UGH. J.F IS TOTALLY BANNED FROM MY BOOK LIST.
3,"OK, but less than stellar","While not as good as Kissed by a Spy, it's not bad. It presents the intrigue and danger of 16th century England in an absorbing way. Pen is a great character, but I'll agree that Lionel is a mixed bag as a hero. He never becomes quite heroic enough. Most people have a problem with Lionel's part in Pen's repeated, drugged rape; it is a terrible offense, but like most fallible humans, he thought at the time that his restraint was for a a good cause. In the end, had he not stood by, he would not have been around to rescue her. Not pleasant, granted.This book is not as complete, as fulfilling, as its predecessor. The secondary romance is brushed over (Robin did deserve his own book), and many details are not fleshed out enough."
4,Jane Feather Can Do NO wrong!,"You have probably read the synopsis already. I won't go into whether the subject matter is wrong or not. Jane Feather has written again an intriguing plot filled with unforgettable characters. Her eloquence (and elegance) of language has taken on new meaning if history is your interest. Her hero, Lionel Ashton, is a duplicate of Hugh from ""The Widow's Kiss"". Pippa remains the same, only stronger and more intelligent. This was a no-brainer ""buy"" immediately and after 12 hours of straight reading, I was overwhelmed!My history lessons tell me that Queen Mary's role in this plot is not ""right"". Mary, the virtuous, Mary, the Pious, would not knowingly have been part of this. But that is a minor consideration since none of us read historical romances for their historical significances - do we? Nor do we read them for their ""nicety"" of subject matter. This was, after all, the 1500's in England. Don't skip this story. You won't regret it."
1,Exploitation as Romance? Yuck!,"This book sickened me. How on earth Jane Feather can expect us to accept the relationship between Phillippa and Lionel, even after Phillippa realizes that Lionel was the one taking her (drugged and helpless) to and from the king each and every time she was raped, I just can't comprehend. If there had been some kind of satisfactory repentance on Lionel's part, some kind of show of self-loathing at what he had done, maybe I could have accepted the ""love"" story. But as it is, no way. Phillippa deserved better than that, and the author threw her away. A disgusting story by an author whom I expected better from."
1,Disturbing and truly unromantic plot . . .,"While I generally enjoy Jane Feather's books, I was deeply disturbed by the premise of the novel. The ""hero"" facilitates the sexual assault of the heroine, and while it is supposedly distasteful to him, his discomfort did not stop him from repeatedly aiding rape. That is NOT romantic. The heroine forgives him fairly easily, and after two other books featuring this character I had truly wanted better for her. NOT well done, Ms. Feather. Not well done at all."
1,disappointing,"Jane Feather is a talented author who likes to tackle new and challenging ideas in her books. Sadly, this one just doesn't work for me. The hero is the biggest problem. Not only did he facilitate the heroine's rape, he also chose to keep her in the dark when the two of them were already engaged in an affair. Character development was insufficient, I just can't indentify with the hero's so called tormented past and his reasons for taking part in that hideous plot. The heroine doesn't fare any better either. I don't find myself sympathise with her despite the fact that she was a victim and can't understand why she chose to forgive him. The complete lack of chemistry and the big ""ick"" factor totally put me off."
2,Not my idea of a romance novel.,"... While Ms. Feather is a good writer, I DID NOT like the premise of this story. The book begins with a vile act being committed on the heroine, and the ""romance"" is built on that. What was done to Pippa was disgusting. I didn't like the fact that Pippa and Lionel (who was involved in the rapes) were not even attracted to each other until this happened. I call that perverted. The secondary story about Robin and Luisa that was thrown in, I suppose for comic relief, did not work for me. I didn't even like the ending. It was totally unbelievable that Pippa and Lionel could live happily ever after with the consequences of this plot."
3,"Works, but needs a better magnet","This cord works with my Waring fryer model. The connection seems very light, however. The cord pops off a lot easier than the OEM cord that I misplaced. It seems like the magnet that holds the cord in place and is designed to snap off when tugged is of lesser quality than the magnet in the OEM version. But it's workable, so I give it 3 stars."
3,Not bad...,"The fit is a bit loose (for my model frier), quite easily knocked off if you are not careful; but as long as you are careful, powers it perfectly."
3,Nice try...BUT,"I respect the author's intent, which is quite admirable and amazing. He does a good job of chastising the religious and scientific communities for their rigid and sometimes dishonest inability to accomodate findings and facts that disprove or call into question their ""beliefs"".BUT, his utter reliance on Hebrew mystics disqualifies him from creating a true argument for HIS ""beliefs"". Why would they have a monopoly on universal insights and truths?Still, I enjoyed reading this book, and 3 stars or 3.5 stars is appropriate."
4,Excellent synthesis,"Schroeder does an outstanding job of synthesizing Biblical and extra-biblical Jewish texts in relation to modern scientific discoveries, particularly as they relate to the Big Bang and evolution. His understanding of astrophysics, quantum mechanics and the present state of evolutionary biology seem solid. He has a keen understanding of Biblical texts (see his discussion in the appendix on 'dinosaurs in the Bible!'). Theologically, I find the only drawback to be an apparent equal weight given to the Kabalah as to Torah and the prophets, with little distinction between the wisdom of sages and divine inspiration of the texts. Overall, the book is quite excellent and I have recommended it to many already."
3,Confuses the physical and spiritual worlds.,"If you want to read a book with some interesting interaction between science and religion that is not nonsense, I suggest ""The Bible According to Einstein."" I read it and it is excellent."
1,I can only say it in Yiddish,"Oy vay!(If you don't speak yiddish it's a short way of saying ""cut the crap because it hurts my head"".)I have rarely seen a more ridiculous example of sophistry and naarishkeit... sorry there I go again. It's worth reading as an example of how not to think. Combines junk science and terrible theology. I hope his Rebbe doesn't get to hear of it."
4,It was an excellent book,"The book is a fascinating study on how hard science can agree with biblical teachings. This book will definately not be welcomed in certain quarters, both in the religious and especially the scientific communities. As a scientist myself I commend Mr. Schroeder on his methods of research. Whether you agree or disagree with the premise, you should take the time to pick up the book. It WILL make you think and that's the most important thing any book can do."
5,"Compelling,intelligentand ambitious work.","Gerald Schroder has written a compelling, intelligent and ambitious work which bolsters the creationists, as opposed to literalists, side of the evolutionary debate. Genisis, the first six days, and the BIG BANG,explained as epochs, understood in terms of a process of events, is one of the best explantions of the 24-hour day conundrum I have read."
5,Simply mind boggling,"I heard about this book from several different places and had read some short extracts. But after reading the entire book, I view this as nothing less than a paradigm shift. Fantastic, well written and breakthrough."
5,FINALLY,"FINALLY, an honest book that is void of seemingly intellectual opinions based on incomplete data and is based on facts of science. I have been through graduate studies, worked in schools, and this is the most fascinating and informative book I have ever read. This shoild be mandated reading in schools that want to promote discovered facts of science, but unfortunately I will not hold my breath. If one cannot understand all the science and math, like me, no problem, just read on and all is reduced to understandable and observable content. As the book illustrates, the most important discovery in the history of science is the discovery of the God Matrix."
2,Wasted work,"Dr. Schroeder's book represents a great idea and a lot of scientific research. It's masterfully done. Unfortunately, it is not biblical. His theological research is not so great. In Exodus 20:8-11 God tells us unequivocally that He is using actual 24 hour days in the Genesis creation. This is in the giving of the ten commandments. He tells us to pattern our lives on His example of a 6 day work week with the 7th day reserved for rest. A relative day just doesn't fly.Gerry"
3,The book was interesting but needed more thought,I found the author's theories interesting. But trying to fit square science into round scripture was sometimes annoying. More research needed to be done in areas other than the author's expertise. The book was also weakened by too much reliance on one ancient scripture to back up his theories. All in all it was enjoyable and made me think.
5,Astounding bordering on beyond words,"The only reason that this isn't a ten is so that I can always have an ace, just in case the book to end all books is published. Dr. Schroeder gives answers to questions that I always felt were and would be unanswerable. He shows us not only how man, the universe, earth, etc. were created, but why they were created. This book has broadened my mind and given my life meaning. I will never read the torah (the bible) the same way again."
2,Interesting but Flawed,"A good and refreshing read, but the quotations from Jewish sources are very selective, and in some places outright misleading. Also, sometimes sounds too patronizing."
5,Great book,"I really enjoyed this book. The biblical ideas fit a little too perfectly with science, but I really have to hand it to schroeder who poses original, thoughtful theories to combine religion and science. A very enjoyable read. I have used many chapters in some college level interdisciplinary classes that I teach. Students are always intrigued. better than his second book. BTW, not junk science or junk religion. Highly recommend."
5,Excellent read,"Finally, someone has come up with a plausible and fascinating argument for how the Bible depiction of creation (6 days) and the evidential age and order of the universe's creation (billions of years)tie together. The book resonates well, and I look forward to updates.Judith Virta, author of Sheol Has Opened."
3,Cool book,"This book is good to read. If you are interested in connections between Genesis and the Big Bang Theory together, then read it. His ideas are loosely supported and should be taken as ideas that you can keep locked up somewhere for future reference, not dogmatic laws of the cosmos. All in all, it's a quick good read with some neato ideas.I didn't notice any huge errors in this book, but if you check the numbers he does tend to round off. I guess since the value of the hubble constant is still in doubt his ideas are probably still valid."
1,Revised Title: The Delusions of Gerald Schroeder,"I was intrigued by the title, but agitated by the contents. The entire book is filled with completely preposterous assumptions and conclusions. After reading such a book, I begin to question why someone, such as Gerald Schroeder, view themselves as scientists."
2,Reframes old arguments,"Mr. Schroeder mentions the dinosaur problem with the Bible but doesn't go far with it, because he can't. I would think he convinces mainly those who are members of the choir who have already taken that leap of faith."
1,He's got it backwards!,"When I first started reading this book I was very much encouraged to see his accounting for gravitational time dilation. Then I realized he got it backward. A clock ticks slower in a gravitational field, so time on earth is 24 hours and ticking of a clock at the edge of an expanding universe is much much faster, billions of years. The author is a Day Ager. This theory is in error both theologically and scientifically. The days of Genesis are not long ages of time, they are 24hrs of earth time. How could someone of such intelligence and learning get it backward and be so confusing on this subject?"
2,"Dem bones, dem bones....","Books like this are, and should be, fun. And it is! But...taking empirical data and misinterpreting and misapplying, leaving out critical factual items, and generally filtering it through a major religious philiosphy will achieve the desired results for any author. Perhaps we are really beginning to get the picture that mixing faith and science makes a poor cocktail. If other reviewers have decided that this book will change their lives, then so be it. I felt the same way after my first Spenser P.I. novel. Well, maybe not completely. Dr. Schroeder should be commended on a ""good try."" If he had written a similar tome 100 years ago with the then current level of knowledge, we would be all having a good hoot at his expense. I don't think it will take another 100 to dissolve much of the author's conclusions. ""Abraham born in 1948""....actually a very appropriate way to start the book. Now....where's that copy of ""Chariots of the Gods""? ! That was fun too."
5,An excellent book that is highly recommended,"As a physicist, Schroeder presents convincing arguments about how belief in the Bible can complement modern scientific thought. It will make you appreciate Scripture in a deeper level and marvel at the natural laws working to keep our universe the way it is. Hopefully, it will answer your questions such as ""Are dinosaurs mentioned in the Bible?"""
4,Fun football,"Excellent magazine with in-depth interviews and news coverage not easily-available here in the U.S. At times it pokes fun at the games stars, management, officials, and even its fans, yet it also is not afraid to tackle important issues in the game. Also includes fun contests in every issue.Aside from the fact that the photographers go out of their way to insure that athletic company logos appear as often as possible in the magazine's many photo spreads, Four Four Two is an excellent read."
1,Is 4-4-2 magazine real?,I've paid for a year's subscription but three months later no magazine. If you want this magazine strongly consider going to your local bookstore and do not risk throwing away your money here.
5,Astoria,"Morling's first collection, ""Ocean Avenue"", was surprise filled favorite of mine from the start... this too, ""Astoria"", is a beautiful book filled with elegant, and simple, palpable imagery.."
2,Looking Back,"This is NOT the same ""Love Letters "" vinyl I bought in 1965. So why call it that? I feel ripped off. But then I didn't check the listing. Didn't think I'd need to!!"
2,Love Letters,"Although this is not the classic Love Letters album (Era Label)she issued at the time ""Love Letters"" was #1, it does contain the follow-up hit""But Not for Me"" which was not on that original album. However the rest of the album seems like the outtakes from her RCA days."
2,Lester's Letters Disappoint,"Ketty Lester's original Era Records 1962 LP ""Love Letters"" was one of the most seductive recordings of the decade. It was no accident that Lena Horne and Peggy Lee gave their endorsements in the liner notes. Not only does the CD in current release delete some of the best cuts of the original, but Ms. Lester's voice is not in peak condition and production values are below the standard set in 1962."
5,A standard.,"*The* cookbook everyone should have. To put it simply, it made me wanna cook. It sticks to the fundamentals, and explains everything clearly without being verbose. Very good recipes too."
2,Gourmet Not Basic,I was disappointed because I was really looking for a meat and potatoes cookbook. I really didn't care for the stories in the book either.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this recipe book for my daughter, who is a novice cook. The title, ""Basic Cookbook"" indicated someone with little experience. This book was too large and not easy to navigate for someone needing true basics. I'm sorry for giving a negative review, but it is not appealing to me, and I've cooked for many years."
5,The naysayers are wrong.,"Some previous readers/reviewers claim that this cookbook is snooty, requires you to have a personal staff on hand, requires you to get expensive kitchenware, and forces you to go on expeditions for pricey, obscure ingredients. Well, I have found none of those things to be true. I am a destitute grad student who couldn't boil water until last year. Yet somehow, even I can manage to cook recipies from this cookbook on my crappy $40 pot and pan set from Kmart. And with great success. All the recipies that I have ever tried from this cookbook have been hits. My friends are under the impression that I am some master chef. But really, all I did was read this book."
3,Didn't live up to the hype...,"I have heard so much about silver palate cookbooks, so I bought this one based on reviews. I must say that it did not meet my expectations, particularly on the entrees. Every chicken dish that I tried was bland. The vegetable section offers no new ideas. I did however, really like the lasagna recipe-basic, hearty, and easy to prepare."
1,Damaged Book,"The New Basics Cookbook by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins, arrived damaged. It looks like it was wet and resold once it was dry. I am very disappointed."
2,Snooty attitude and silly recipies! A disappointment,"These women must not cook dinner often. If they do, they must have amazing gourmet kitchens. This book has some great recipies if you want to impress someone, and I love the sections that give you menu and snack ideas (how to serve this cheese with that fruit, etc.)....but what's with all the long ingredient lists and obscure ingredients?? This book is not practical for everyday use. The lemon cookie recipie didn't work, and I've heard that other recipies were wrong, so I don't tend to use this book for actual cooking, just for ideas. It looked like a great book but overall was a letdown."
5,The essential kitchen reference,"This is the one cookbook I turn to when I need to find a great recipe for a classic dish, or simply need some fundamental information. A great reference to have at hand, even if it's become a little dated -- I wouldn't be without it!"
5,A cookbook you will refer to time and time again!,"This is a must-have for every cook. The cookbook is not only practical, but fun, a criteria for most of the books I purchase. I use this cookbook all of the time and it has yet to fail me! This is a book that I give to brides and new homeowners...and they always love it. This is the one cookbook I would own if I had to chose just one."
5,Best cookbook for people who love to cook.,"I've had this cookbook for so long and used it so much that it's falling apart. The meatloaf recipe is the best meatloaf I've ever made. Not only do I love the recipes in this book, but the very first Silver Palate cookbook actually taught me to love cooking by making it fun and beautiful. I can't believe it's been 25 years. I was still in college when I first received that book. Cheers to Sheila and Julee!"
5,the best,"I disagree with the reviews that say this isn't a good cookbook for beginners. It does indeed, contrary to the synopsis, tell you how to boil an egg, as well as poach it, scramble it, and coddle it. I consider myself to be a beginner, and this cookbook has never failed to answer my questions."
2,CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT,"I love to cook, and go beyond the basics in what I prepare, ingredients used, and amount of time involved. I often start from scratch and acutally enjoy the time spent in the kitchen...so why is it I can find the energy, time or interest in making ANYTHING in this cookbook? I have owned it a year and a half, and have yet been moved enough to try more than 1 recipe. I often find a version I like better from more tried and true sources like my Bon Appetit or Gourmet magazines. This cookbook is just ""too much"". The one recipe I made for stuffed artichokes failed me and I don't seem to be too intersted in using it again. I can't figure out why such a popular book is so unapealling to me, but I would happily give this away if the chance arose."
4,Beautiful,"I loved this movie and the acting, my only problem is tha Amazon tells us the movie is in English and it's not. Stop fooling the customers. If fact Amazon needs to change all the other foreign films thay say are in English and are not. Customer beware."
5,Carmen: Brilliant in All Ways,"If you like the opera ""Carmen"" you have to like this version of it. It's ingenius . . . sensitive . . . captivating . . . and inspiring."
4,Fantastic!!!,This movie was well done!! The cast was very talented and the story which had a contemporary theme made it enjoyable to view. I wish there were more movies as this. U-Carmen may well establish a precedent for more movies like it. Good work!!
5,I like the energy this gives me!!!,These tablets help gave me the energy that I need to get me through the shifts at work. Helps me from getting so tired.
3,Just what it looks like,"What you see is what you get. The mesh seen is in the picture is actually mesh (there is no white lining behind it). And there is no dry pocket as described: ""Users will also dig the inside dry pocket, which protects everything from a change of clothes to important valuables as water sloshes about."""
4,A great basic gear bag,"I got this gear bag and love it. It doesn't have a lot of the features you'll see in higher-priced bags; its really just a durable mesh duffle bag, but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry, and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins, boots, masks, snorkels, and any other small gear like defog, gloves, knives, wrist compasses/computers, etc."
2,"Product not as described, you get what you pay for","According to the product description ""Users will also dig the inside dry pocket, which protects everything from a change of clothes to important valuables as water sloshes about."" Unfortunately, no such pocket exists. Also, bag is too small to realisitically fit all dive gear. you probably need something larger. D rings are plastic and seem like they will eventually break if you tried to carry all of your gear as they are not very well made. otherwise bag seems sturdy and as described."
4,"Great, sturdy bag, no pocket","This is a great bag with plenty of room for two sets of snorkel gear. Just disappointed that it doesn't have the inside dry pocket, as mentioned"
2,Serviceable Bag,"Just received bag and haven't yet put it to heavy duty use. Preliminary comments:1) Construction seems sturdy enough. Easily holds fins (large), masks and snorkels for two.2) No dry pocket despite statement in ad. As one reviewer put it - you get what you see in the ad picture. Someone really should correct the advertising however.Update:Just purchased another bag -- and it's not the U.S, Divers bag. Decided that the dry pocket offered with Brand X was worth another 10$."
2,Not as Advertised,"The bag is serviceable but not what I expected. The shoulder strap is very cheap and the plastic pins snapped with the weight of my gear (fins, BCD, regulator, mask, snorkel and wet suit) on the first use. There is no dry pocket as the description says. I'm sending it back."
3,Tingling Shampoo for Scalp and Hair Treatment,"My barber recommended this shampoo as I've had a problem with thinning hair for the past several years. If your like me and worried about hair loss or thinning hair and tried alternatives like Rogaine, etc., this is a good alternative.I been using the shampoo for the past two weeks, almost daily, and my hair/scalp has been feeling re-energized! For some reason, I love the tingling minty sensation on my scalp when I apply this shampoo.As far as results, I cannot say I am experiencing hair growth but it does feel more voluminous and much less work than Rogaine. I'll re-visit back to update after several months of use.NOTE: For some reason, this shampoo either sells out quickly or the supplier cannot meet demands."
4,Impressed,"It takes a lot to impress me with beauty products as I have worked in the beauty industry 15 years. I am trying to grow my hair out. I have had so many comments from co-workers about how long my hair has gotten & how great it looks. Needless to say, I'm impressed!"
5,Description,"Show your school colors with 12 designs for knit blankets and wearables, made using Chunky USA by Lion Brand Yarn. All are machine washable and dryable, which makes them great for outfits for the entire family!This 32-page soft-cover booklet features easy-to-read instructions and full-color photographs for 12 projects to knit or crochet, guaranteed to give your student a sense of style and comfort.

All patterns feature Lion Brand chunky yarn and range from beginner to intermediate skill levels."
4,Essential for Students of Early Christianity,This title has collected together some important essays by significant authors on Early Christianity in General and Monasticism in particular .
2,Fairly dull,"This book was just not interesting. All the human characters were men. It was hard to tell them apart. They formed no personal relationships. They didn't even have names but were referred to by their jobs.Their discoveries on a strange planet were also not interesting. One could hardly make any sense of them. When the men finally learn what the planet is all about, that, too, is disappointing and not interesting.The only reason I give this book two stars instead of one is that the writing wasn't terrible."
2,Just an OK book.,"I really couldn't get caught up in the story. It did make the case that alien species will probably not be anything like mankind and men will not be able to make any judgements of them based on there previous experiences. However, I could not get interested in the characters and found the story somewhat confusing. I did finish the book, but came away feeling glad that I was done."
1,Terrible.,"I finished it. I don't know why. I guess I wanted to be able to see if it would get better. It didn't. Maybe I wanted to see if it would have a good ending. It didn't. I can't comment on any other LEM written books because this is the only one I've read, but based on my experience with this particular book, I doubt that I'll venture down this path again."
3,Funny but not *that* funny,"This is mild stuff, basically a collection of light verse about poetry (famous poems and basic techniques). I can't say I enjoyed it as much as the other reviewers, but I will say there are some funny poems in here, especially the parodies of famous poets. Not all of the poems have aged well, but you get enough of them that it's worth it provided this is the sort of thing you are looking for.If you are looking for didactic (teaching) poems, I recommend John Hollander's RHYME'S REASON. If you are looking for an explanation of meter, I suggest Timothy Steele's ALL THE FUN'S IN HOW YOU SAY A THING. Both of them are also more readily available."
2,Maybe not the worst western ever--but close,"This has got to be one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. For example, it starts off by showing several unrelated sections of the movie by way of clips. They even show you most of the ending. Later in the movie you see these same clips again, this time in context. What makes this perhaps one of the oddest Western movies I ever saw is the fact that nobody, except for the villain, seems to own a gun of any kind. Secondly, Sterling Hayden has the worst Swedish accent I have ever heard. The basic plot is run-of-the-mill, there's a big land grab and nobody except a pacifist farmer will stand up and fight. Unless you are a big fan of so-so movies and/or Sterling Hayden I would suggest you skip this movie."
5,On of the greatest B-films (of westerns),"Everything is just right, the actors, the atmosphere, action. Sometimes miracles do happen. I would put it just below the great westerns. It is actually a 4,5 star film, but 4 stars is not enough. I rank it with the Boetticher-Scott films."
1,One Star,"My friend Judy gets to review this movie for me because I suggested she watch it and this is a condition of forgiveness:Since I have to give this one star, let the star be a collapsing black dwarf.Sterling Hayden gives the worst performance in any actor's life. He might as well be a talking roast beef. My friend said ""lutefisk?"" but his Swedish accent does not bear up under the comparison.It isn't just the movie that's bad--the score (guitar, trumpet, ?, etc.?) was obviously written by an escapee from the Insane Musicians' Mexican Rest Home.Nuff said.P.S. I have a friend who says ""blame it on the director."" OK. Blame it on the director."
5,Satisfied Customer,Very pleased with product and the packaging was excellent!!!Also it was delivered very quickly!!! Another plus that makes me a satisfied customer... Thank you
1,"Arrived broken--- if it couldn't survive UPS, how can it survive a big fish?","It came broken in half. This was supposed to be an extrememly strong graphite pole! There was no box damage, so I think it may have been shipped already broken. It's been a month since I ordered it and just today received word that they received the return... better luck with something else."
5,WONDERFUL book!,"Lots of hard research provides a little information on this painter. Most of the information centers around the paintings, and sketches themselves , as well of the criticism of his art. This book contains 160 + beautiful , high quality images . (including one of J.W. Godward as a child..) I usually lean towards Pre-Raphaelite art, but found this artist to be a refreshing and bright alternate interest . I think the book is well worth the price!"
3,Good book not worth todays asking price !,"This is a great book as fare as the color reproductions. John William Godward has received very little recognition until the past few years and this book has beautiful repersentations of a good deal of his paintings. However, I cannot speak to the quality of the text, because I did not have the chance to read it.I almost bought this book at Barns and Knoble six years ago and didn't because of the $85.00 cover price. Now I wish that I had. The two sellers of this now out of print book are asking just under a thousand and just over a thousand for a USED book!!! What planet are these guys from?To sum it up nice book, but not worth anything close to the asking price. If you do buy it you have more money than common sense."
4,A most fascination and plethoric capturing of the Man.,"The Art of Squire Godward most endearing and some of the most lovely and well captured depictations of feminine beauty one able ever encountre. The delicacy of his renderings of the female figre, ripe breasts and firm thighs vissable just beneath their thin gauze-like dresses, reveals a decidedly observant Artist able rendre the beauty of God`s creation, His apotheosis, in its most idealised form."
3,Not the best Zen book ever,"I've read a few of Dibdin's Aurelio Zen works and liked this one the least -- I won't give the plot away, but it begins one with one very vivid and interesting setting and then, well, wanders aimlessly until it ends quite a way from where it started, and I do not mean in a quirky, surprising way but in an annoying, ill-crafted way. One character also stands out like a peacock on a telephone line, and throughout the book you try to ignore him (he's that flashy/boring) and then at the end--poof, he's important! If you like to read about Rome, though, you've got some decent descriptions and a garlic-scented atmosphere for sure."
4,"Murder, fashion and The Vatican: quite a combination.","I really enjoyed my first experience with, Dibdin's Aurelio Zen. A flawed and very human policeman, who is not above stating a murder was a suicide because that's what the powers that be desire, finds himself drawn into a grand conspiracy despite himself. This is a case where first impressions are definitely incorrect and despite his misgivings, Zen succeeds in resolving things in a believable, if convoluted fashion. The best part of CABAL is the ease with which Dibdin brings Italy to life. From The Vatican to Milan, the reader is transported with a stunning simplicity, with Dibdin creating a setting that is vivid and characters that come alive. I will definitely have to read Dibdin's other Zen books and I am sorry to hear that the author has passed away. At least he had the opportunity to create such a unique character."
5,Zen seried by Digbin,I canceled the last order of five books in SeptThe time of mailing was absurd (Oct 17 to Dec 1)No response
2,nVidia beats this..,"This card is good, but for the same price you can get a geforce6800GT, which beats this card by a lot. You dont need dual p4 processors like someone said, it will still be a good increase from your last card even if you only have a 2 ghz processor. Good card, once the price drops $100.2/5 stars"
5,very good graphics card,the ati radeon x800 pro 256mb graphics card is a very good especially if you have been using a weak integrated onboard graphics card that is 64mb. do your self a favor and get a dedicated card that is stronger than a 64mb integrated graphics card like the x800 if you want to be able to watch movies or play some some early 21st century pc games.
3,Killer Fast for older games,"This card is wonderful for playing 2003 era fast FPS games!But be careful, this model does NOT support the new Shader Model 3, which is going to be an increasingly important limitation as it's used in more and more games. If you need a new card NOW, this one can't be beat, but if you can wait for the next update that supports SM 3, you'll be happier that your tech didn't go stale so quickly."
4,For every age...,"Our family is VeggieTales-crazy. We children really like this CD, and I'm sure the new one is even better. Both the songs and movies are Christian-oriented, and give a new perspective on Biblical truths. I'd recommend this CD for anyone who has children older 2."
1,DVD Player was DOA,"This DVD player didn't work at all - it was DOA. Because I purchased it from Amazon, returning it & getting credit was very easy!"
3,Think about it!,"Very cheap! The model is nice and light. Anyway, it could play dvd for 20 minutes, then it was dead. I almost lost my dvd. I contacted the Sylvania for the problem. She told me that the optical len was broken. Then, I returned to Amazon. Now I received a new one. Just wait and look for what will happen. -- I hope it will not have to return it again.After I received a new one. It works well!"
5,Excellent Product,"First off, this product is NOT for drying!! It is meant for taking off WAX or OTHER FINISHING PRODUCTS. A chamois is meant for taking off water like a sponge, then ringing it out. Excellent product I use it to take wax off my Mustang without scratching the surface!"
2,paper towels are better,"This thing is horrible. It does remove the water from the vehicle and it absorbs large amounts between ringing it out. the problem is after your all done the vehicle has spots similar to after a rainfall and it dries. Not at all like my real chamios (sorry 'bout that spellin' if it's wrong). Eh, it was cheap anyway and I only ordered it as a filler to get free shipping on the rest of my order."
2,"Nothing special, should have listened to the samples before purchase.","Was looking into easy and relaxing jazz piano music ... found quite boring complex and chaotic mix of sounds.The Bob Acri performance is very good, just the music is not my style."
4,Thought from Middle East,"When I watched the film ""The passion of the Christ"" I felt as I didn't see an American movie,And this made the film original and special, the actors and the environment were chosen very cleverly .After all it was great pleasure to me to hear Armenian music in the film , which was played also by an Armenian instrument ""duduk"" ,especially in the scene where ""a woman giving water to Jesus "" .This music is adapted from a famous old Armenian folksong ""Deli yaman""I know that John Debney didn't mentioned it but it's not necessary, you can check this in the ""Djivan Gasparian"" cedes ,who composed with Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard in the score ""Gladiator"", and he also have played duduk in that score.However Mel Gibson have done a great job and thanks him to give back the looking of Jesus in the films to his regionMiddle East from where I am .Linda Chamichian"
5,The score is incredible.,"I bought this after seeing the film a third time. This CD is a must-have for anyone who enjoyed the film The Passion of the Christ.Each of the tracks are powerful experiences, but some key tracks include: ""Mary Goes To Jesus"", ""Crucifixion"", ""Raising the Cross"", and ""Ressurection"".Overall, the CD is excellent and wonderous to behold."
5,Brilliant,"The soundtrack and the movie were both brilliant and beautiful. Awesome movie with painful agonizing feelings mixed in but overall I believed the movie was fantastic. The songs bring the mood, especially to this movie, and it plays a very important part in it as well."
3,Uninspiring,"I have to say I let the cinema feeling numb after this movie. Not because it was good,but because it was needlessly violent; self indulgent and the most uninspiring movie about The Passion ever made. That said the soundtrack, is a subtle as the movie. In the movie it was overbearing, on CD is good listen, but I expected something more haunting, sad and beautiful, much like my expectations for the film. That said it is a fair anough soundtrack."
4,The Passion,"Great, powerful, moving music. Haunting and memorable. Echoes many of the great epic Zimmer and Horner scores.However,I heard that James Horner was going to compose the score then Lisa Gerrard. What happened to Lisa Gerrard? I think she would have done an excellent job. Her new album with Patrick Cassidy, ""Immortal Memory"" has some songs that sound as if they belong in this movie. I dunno, but I want to know why she didn't wind up doing the score.And on the newest trailer (not the teaser with the great peter gabriel ""Long walk home"" song) there is a song that has the same melody of the ""Resurrection"" song from this soundtrack, except it features the duduk, many other ethnic instruments, and Gerrard's haunting voice. Does anyone know why this wasn't in the movie? Is there any way to get this song? Thank you"
5,Wow,"Hey All! Wow is all I can say in regards to this Soundtrack. And the amazing thing is, majority of the reviews I have read agree that the most stirring pieces are the Crucifixion, and Raising The Cross.. I had my headphones on listening to this these very songs that I just mentioned and didnt realize I was in tears...It gave me chills as I recreated those scenes in my head from the movie...Although I know some people will be negative about anything really in todays time,it sure was nice to see some who really appreciated this score.Blessings to you allangie in atlanta"
2,There's no passion in this cd,I immediately fell in love with the music from the theatrical trailer but that song is no where to be found on the cd. None of the music is powerful and doesn't really do anything for me. If I could I would get my money back. I really don't think that the music lived up to the movie.
3,Trailer music,"The music on the original trailer when the film was just called 'The Passion' was from the Peter Gabriel album the long walk home, which was the soundtrack to the film Rabbit proof Fence"
3,Only 30 seconds?,"You really can't tell how well the album sounds due to the fact you can only hear 30 seconds of the songs. On the frist two songs, they where just getting started, so you really can't judge. They do start of nicely, but it would be really nice to hear a little more of each song."
3,"Crap movie, decent score","OK, I didn't like this heavy-handed, one-dimensional, money-maker of a movie. However, I have to give credit where credit is due. This is an exellent score that can not be as easily dismissed as the film that it supports. Magnificently recorded and very well composed, this is a real piece of work. Some of these other reviewers seem a little confused. This score is definitely not the sound of 2000 years ago. I say this with confindence as I know how the composer generated these sounds, and trust me oh simple sheep, the instruments didn't exist even 10 years ago let alone 1000. Buy this score if it caught your attention from seeing the movie (as it did mine), but buy a used cut-out so as pope mel doesn't profit."
3,Derivavtive of Gabriel,"The best thing about LAST TEMPTATION was Peter Gabriel's score. Turns out it is the best thing about this film as well. I'm not sure how Gibson copped a songwriting credit, but the whole thing is a Hollywoodization of the textures assembled by Gabriel. Is it good? Yeah. But I already own PASSION. So, it would be nice if the 2 guys claiming credit for this music would at least acknowledge that, perhaps, like George Harrison, they did not really know they were lifting music wholecloth."
1,review the music-not your beliefs,I am a fan of middle eastern and world music and have not seen this film-however i do occasionally rely on reader reviews to decide whether or not ill pick up a cd. All im getting is religion crammed down my throat or intellectual meanderings countering it. please just stick to the music score. would someone without prejudice just tell me whether this cd is good or not- your faith or lack of it means nothing to me-i just want a good cd ala peter gabriels passion or any natacha atlas cd which i both like. thanks
3,Music from the time of Kristos,"This is a fine album--almost as good as Gabriel's Passion soundtrack. However, many of you seem to be interested in using music to 'transport yourselves to the time of Christ while meditating on scripture.' For those people, I must reccomend that you immediately buy a copy of Passion Sources, which showcases the actual artists from the Holy Land, to transport you to an actual time of Christ rather than a modern film maker/star's idea of what the actual time of Christ would sound like if it were in a movie."
4,WHERE'S THE TRAILER MUSIC?!?!,"I have found hints of the melody from the trailer score that Debney composed. That music was the reason why I bought this soundtrack, and I'm disappointed that it's not on featured.Other than that, I really like this. It is similar to Peter Gabriel's soundtrack from Last Tempatation, but I think this is strong enough to stand on it's own. I can also see why the one reviewer mentioned 'Glory;' in Crucifixtion at least, there is a similar chord progression as one of the main theme from Glory.Great soundtrack (other than no trailer music), and I recommend it."
5,Excellent Emotional Soundtrack,"This CD is an excellent addition to all soundtrack collectors weather you are a fan of Church\Christ. The music is so deep and emotional, you feel like you are standing right there when these things happened to Jesus. Especially #11 Crusifiction. That I think is one of the best songs on the CD. Its about 7 minutes long. In closing the whole CD is excellent, and so is the movie. If you havent seen the movie, see it at least once and you'll understand the music more better. I give props to JOhn Debney for such an excellent score. He's copied no ones work, so ignore the other reviews and take my word. Excellent CD. Get it before its gone."
5,Beautiful Soundtrack,"For me the most inspiring track is ""Resurrection"". I remember the day that I saw this movie for the first time almost 3 years ago. My friend and I stayed until the end of the credits only to listen to this track. It's my candidate for best final scene in a movie. Now , 'Resurrection"" (as the rest of the album) is in my Creative Zen Vision M and I listen to this beautiful piece of music everyday. It's really inspiring. Buy it!!!P.S. There are so many Jews here and there writing a lot of negative reviews about this soundtrack and the movie. Don't pay any atention to that. This soundtrack and the movie are masterpieces."
3,ehhh.....,"It was okay. The music seemed a lot better in the film than on CD. The CD is too quiet and calm for my tastes. I enjoy a couple of the tracks, but a majority of them are just so-so."
5,beautiful score,"i love the soundtrack tothi sfilm. it adds to the drama being played out on screen. as i hear some of the tracks, for example, 'mary goes to jesus' i can see the scene in my head. this is the part in the film where i just completely lost it. the interaction between mother and son. just beautiful music"
4,Powerful and Moving Score Will Keep the Film in your Mind,"John Debney's score, while reminiscent of Peter Gabriel's for ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", has a sound all its own, particularly during the crucifixion.The music is haunting and moving. As the listener hears the music, they will recall the specific scenes from the film and will occassionally be moved to tears.As interesting as the music, the story behind Debney's own spiritual journey and conversion during the creating of the score is equally as compelling. Clearly, the Holy Spirit was at work not only on the film, but on those involved in its various aspects.This CD works well as background music while you're working, or better yet praying. It's a great companion piece to any of the number of books available on the film. I highly recommend it."
5,good,I love the movie and sound tranck work good with the movie it's a good way to pull the movie together.
5,Contemplate Passion,"I had access to this soundtrack prior to viewing the movie. It is moving, riveting, and soulful. I can almost envision the elements that each title represents. My husband has listened to it nonstop while at work for the past 2 days and has come home with a totally different attitude.I highly recommend this especially as background music to listen to while meditating on Sacred Scripture. (Not too loud, just softly in the background.)"
3,Score doesn't stand well on it's own,I really liked the movie so I picked up the soundtrack on a lark. Well it didn't really sound that great by itself. I wish I had listened to some samples first. You may want to try that before you buy. I don't think it's for everyone.
2,Buy Peter Gabriel's Passion,"Anyone who knows Peter Gabriel's Passion would agree with me in saying that John Debney's score has taken liberally from Gabriel's incredible work, and a few have written as much in the Online reviews for this item. Do yourself a favor, buy Peter Gabriel's Passion. Even though The Last Temptation of Christ may not have been the best movie, the soundtrack was, one of my favorites. I listen to it often, and each time it takes me to another place.Another plug along Christian movie lines, The Mission by Ennio Morricone, a masterpiece."
5,Excellent film score!,"Easily one of the best film scores of the year and worthy of an Oscar nomination, John Debney puts together a great score for the film. He is becoming one of My favorite film composers! The sound is incredible and the choir is fabulous! I recommend this score!"
2,The Curious One,"This ambitious picture, what was once called a ""psychological Western"" is pretty tough-going by today's standards. It isn't especially cinematic in it's presentation and feels kind of flat. Talky and at time overwrought and even pretentious. There are some effective moments, Yul and Rule are both good in some of their scenes."
1,Did your soles fall off?,After 90 days of use the soles started to fall off. After four months the boots were useless!!! Just Don't!!!
5,Excellent Camera,"I bought this camera back in 2004 and since, I have taken thousands of great pictures. It is very easy to use and the quality of the pictures is excellent. It's life has come to a sad end as my 4 and 6 year olders started getting interested in using it. But If we were back in the 2004/2005 time frame I would buy exactly the same camera again. If you are interested in this camera model just make sure you carry an extra battery as a back up."
4,Great Camera but problem with the battery door.,"I love this camera, I have owned it for about two years when it first came out. The pictures are of great quality, and have used some of the special modes and have obtained professional photography results, even though I am just an amateur. The red-eye fix is very helpful. The external metal casing has been durable and scratch resistant.My only drawback is the battery door. A little tab broke off and I have had to tape the lid to the bottom of the camera. The camera works fine, but it just does not feel or look fine now. Which has me now looking for a new one!"
2,Blury inside pics,"Camera did not take good pictures indoor or outdoor, a bit blury (set to Auto of course)and yes my hand was still.Delay lag is a bit long although Nikon claims that its quick (still takes long to autofocus and then snap the shot)Bit the bullet and spent twice as much on Canon G6 and MUCH BETTER, you get what you pay for. Couple hundred more at 900 you can get Rebel G but its quite big and plastic. Liked the feel of the G6, metal, and takes great pics."
3,"Good photos, problem with battery door","This was a decent little camera for it's time. By today's standards it's a bit bulky for the megapixils it offers. There is a design problem with the battery cover / door. It's on the bottom corner of the camera and spring-tensioned. It is pushed down and slid it into a locked position, held by little plastic tabs. These tabs break off easly, leaving the battery door hanging partially open. The camera still works, though you may have to use your pinky to tension the battery door. When travelling we've bumped into a number of people at tourist spots with the same camera. Most have broken battery doors. I like the photos it takes, but this flaw that would prevent me from buying it again."
4,Pretty damn good.,"Okay, I felt compelled to review this after I read this last review, here. It's frighteningly accurate, actually, but doesn't shed a terribly good light on Lorna, who I'm really quite fond of. Her book gives wonderful insights into her mother as does this movie. This last review also doesn't describe Judy quite accurately. Judy was an optimistic soul, but the last hour of M&MS is quite good, IMO. She *had* gone out of her mind from the pills and *was* constantly at odds with anything and everything. While not giving the whole picture, this DVD is a worthwhile watch and very nicely done. Everything couldn't be recreated perfectly and Judy Davis did a pretty damn good job trying to do the impossible."
4,enjoyable,"Having viewed the show on TV, my daughter, who is a music teacher, was thrilled to have it to watch whenever she wants and to share it with her students."
1,"Life with Judy Garland - as ""acted"" by Judy Davis","My ""rating"" is actually a ZERO, except it wasn't allowed. This is a piece of acting tripe. I barely made it thru the 1st night of this when it was on TV; didn't even bother with the 2nd night, I was that disgusted. Judy Davis didn't know ANYTHING about Judy Garland & it shows. Supposedly she studied her. Well, she didn't absorb what she watched & read, for it certainly doesn't show! I'm ashamed of Lorna for thinking Judy Davis could do her mother justice!! The girl that played child Judy EXTREMELY WELL would have been a MUCH better choice. With the skills they had even then they should have just aged HER, instead of TRYING to make Judy Davis look young - didn't work. Judy Davis is HORRIBLE! I do NOT recommed Judy Davis' ""Life with Judy Garland"".Yes, Judy Davis received an Emmy for her portrayal, but, YOU KNOW how THAT goes. She apparently KNEW someone!"
5,"The ""Judys"" floored me...","Loved this movie! I had just gotten finished watching the ""Week with Marilyn"" movie, which disappointed me due to all the rave reviews - sat down and started watching this and thought, ""Now, THAT is how you cast a movie about a true star."" Both actresses nailed their parts in both looks and voice.I have not read the book, nor have I read enough about Judy Garland to know how factual it is - but the feel of the movie and presence of the actresses brought the real Judy to life for me."
5,Judy Garland is wonderful and unforgettable!,"Very good movie! Judy Garland will shine for ever! It's a great homage to Judy Garland! Congratulations for Judy Davis and Tammy Blanchard's roles. I would like to see more about the movies > Little Nellie Kelly; Babes on Broadway; For Me and My Gal; The Harvey Girls and Easter Parade. However, I liked it very much! I love Judy Garland!Roque BeneditoBrazil - South America"
5,Cut scenes on the DVD version...,"This is a 5-star television movie and the performances are incredible as I'm sure you've read. However, on the DVD version, they cut out several scenes so I recommend keeping your VHS copies. One scene is right before Judy performs The Trolley Song in Meet Me in St. Louis, her and Vicente are having an argument in her dressing room right before. Another scene is when she finds out her current boyfriend is having an affair with another man. He walks out of the room half-naked as Lorna and the housekeeper rush to help her take care of the bloody gash on her head. Another scene is when she is about to go on stage for a concert in Australia, and she is too disoriented to perform thus getting booed off the stage. There may be a couple more scenes but these ones I know of for sure. I wish studios would not release DVD's unless they do it right the first time!"
5,Amazing,"This was probably the best made-for-television film or miniseries of the last decade.Tammy Blanchard, who prior to this had been on ""Guiding Light"", was truly amazing as the younger Judy. And there simply is not enough superlatives or adjectives in the dictionary to describe the fabulous Judy Davis and what she did with the role as ""adult"" Judy.I would give this, on a larger scale, a 90 or 95 out of 100. The movie has ONE glaring mistake in it, and that is that Davis assumes the role of Garland too soon in the movie. Davis is a stunningly beautiful woman and looks absolutely fantastic, but she is unconvincing as a girl of 21. I understand WHY the producers/director chose to make the segue at that time story-wise, but Blanchard should have played the Vincente Minnelli, ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" era Garland, as well."
1,Movie was great BUT...I don't understand the video chops!,"I purchased, first the VHS tapes, then the DVD. The VHS had scenes that were not shown in the original broadcast, but the DVD has about 15 minutes missing from the VHS tape. Usually a DVD contains more ""stuff"" than a VHS tape, but not in this case"
4,Judy Too Old,"For some scenes, I think Judy Davis look too old to play Judy Garland. I think they should have kept Tammy Blanchard as Jusy until they where done with the ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" scene. Otherwise, this is a great film for anyone who is a Judy Garland fan!"
2,am i missing something?,"i feel like i've seen a different show . the one i saw was an incredibly badly written run-of-the-mill tv bio pic that featured an ok impersonation by judy davis, but i felt she was more judy davis than judy garland (nobody does narrow-eyed cynicism better than judy davis, and i wonder if judy garland ever had such a mannerism). blanchard, however, is worthy of all the praise she's been given.but the script was so cliched, and i realise it was based on lorna luft's book, but thats no reason to go so heavy handed on the poor-teenage-lorna-but-she's-really-so-wise-and-grown-up direction at the end."
5,Gripping Account of a Sad but Gifted Life,"Superstar flops. Superstar finally dies at age 47 but is, in truth, probably about 102. World doesn't talk about her much after that, probably realizing deep down that it fueled the system that utterly destroyed one of the most spectacular, sensitive, incandescent human talents that ever lived. This well-produced film, and the performances of the actresses in particular, capture the sadness of this unique woman's life. In our modern age where rehab is an everyday yawn for our ""celebs,"" someone should have--could have--done more to help this woman in her youth. She might have stood a chance. The moment she died was probably the biggest relief Judy Garland ever experienced. The world should wish her well and never forget her incomparable gifts."
3,Too many cut scenes-,"The VHS version has cut scenes, too-Where is the whole story of Artie Shaw breaking her heart? Unless I'm dreaming, I saw this plot line in the original on TV-I just got mine in the mail today and I am so disappointed-I'm afraid to see what else was cut-The reason I bought the VHS version instead of the DVD was an earlier reviewer said it was the DVD that cut scenes-Still a crackerjack performance for all concerned-"
5,BRILLIANT !!!! AN INSTANT STANDING OVATION !!!!!,"This movie left me breathless, I did not know much about the real Judy Garland until i saw this movie and the amazing performances by Judy (Davis) Tammy, and the rest of the cast.They all deserved all the awards they've got, it was WONDERFUL!I have seen this movie over and over and over, it never gets tiring. love it! love it! looooove it!"
4,How I moved from this novel,"This is Chrysan Deng from China, I happened to know that my friend Corrine Brown wrote a book and I am very curious to know it, Mrs Corrine Brown gave me the website to download her books and I found it. I got a little about USA western transportation while I was in the colleague, I hope to know more if I read over this book"

3,Interesting,Interesting that both George Sanders & Angela Lansbury also were in The Picture Of Dorian Gray ('45) where the scoundrel was played by Hurd Hatfield. Dorian was the better picture however.
2,"Many good actors, so-so movie","Yet another entry in my quest to see Warren William movies, ""The Private Affairs of Bel Ami"" is really a starring vehicle for George Sanders, the definitive cad of Hollywood. He holds special attractions for hosts of women, all of whom he misuses while furthering his own selfish desires. I hated the look of this picture; to me, it seemed like a set from ""The Twilight Zone""--very unconvincing-looking Paris. Besides Sanders and William, the cast includes Ann Dvorak, John Carradine, and Angela Lansbury. See it if you want to; I don't figure on seeing it again for a couple of years, if then."
1,This is in regard to the CATCOM STUDIOS RELEASE,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF CATCOM HOME STUDIOS DBL. FEATURE ""THE CRAWLING EYE/ KILLER SHREWS"" RELEASE HERE. 20+DOLLARS FOR THIS STUDIOS MOVIES, IS WAY OVER-PRICED FOR SUCK LACK-LUSTER QUALITY. Do not even bother, their only quality as a Studio, is that they release hard to find film, but its not made the way it should be.This is really cheap studio, they do not remaster any of the films. You would be better off getting the Euro version, that was made for the USA, at about 5-7 with shipping. Plus your getting a stellar print. Image does great work on the films they release. So get some soda, popcorn and a proper copy of this great gem from the 50's and enjoy!Dont get me wrong, this is from personal experience. Go with Image, once again and enjoy!PS: in my opinion do not buy this version this item and"
5,fabulous series,"There are nearly 40 books in this series, and I have read them all. The story follows teenage Gaia Moore, a girl born without the fear gene. She's a tomboy/martial arts expert who scours the New York nightlife looking for scoundrels to put in their place. Her love interest, Sam Moon, and best friend, Ed Fargo, help to keep the story interesting 30+ books later. I do think it's odd that book 1 and book 25 are packaged together. It would be better to sell the first 2 or 3 in a set. I love series, but I prefer to read them in order."
1,High Failure Rate - Do Not Buy!,"I had my IBM Deskstar running for about 3 months before it failed. Many different models of the IBM Deskstar IDE Drives have had a very high rate of failure. They are even being sued for it. (...)Even worse, just try to return an IBM drive. You have to first do a drive fitness test, then get an RMA, and then package it ONLY with foam packaging and then pay for it to be sent to IBM and maybe in 2-3 weeks you will receive a replacement drive, which could be the same defective model.Avoid the Deskstar IBM drives at all cost until they get their reliability problems sorted out."
1,High failure rate,"The Deskstar 75GXP I bought failed with a head crash after three months. Apparently, these drives have an abnormally high failure rate. There's plenty of other inexpensive 80G hard drives around. Avoid this one."
1,Never IBM HD!!!,"One year b4, I bought [another hd], it is quiet and fast, I was happy with it! After a few months I heard a lot of negative new about this series of HD, I don't believe it, because my drive still works fine... I used to treat it very well; I used a big fan to keep it very cool.After one yr., I tried to do surface scan with it, a few scratching sounds came out, 8K bad sectors. I have some idea what's wrong... so backup all my data immediately.Then I tried to do low level format, but the result is 65MB bad sectors found!!! I also tried to use IBM's HD tools to fix... still fail..."
1,Click of death,"Two weeks out of the box, the drive starting making clicking/scratching noises... diagnostic programs say it fails surface scan... looks like a major mechanism error...I just hope I can get IBM to replace it..."
1,Too risky right now...,"Do yourself a favor and run a Google search on ""IBM Deskstar failure"" or ""crashing"" and you'll turn up a bunch of articles and newsgroup discussions. Mine lasted 9 months and then crashed (right after I did a backup to it) out of the blue. Dead. Zippo. Nada. The return process at IBM could be better, but I am weary of getting another Deskstar that might fail the same way again. Seagate or Maxtor (just bought Quantum) are probably safer bets for now."
1,This drive WILL CRASH,"Just like most of the people here, I have been burned by IBM's DeskStar drives - I had two of them crash on me, and one was less than a year old. You are taking a massive risk if you purchase an IBM drive."
1,Very poor,"I am an IBM hard drive victim. After just 7 months. Out of the box I had a loud whirr. But it worked so no more of that...Just piled loads of important data on it. Then.....Clunking harddrive, although not very frequent.Then eventually corrupted files, crashes on any surfice test.And now fails to load. New Maxtor goes strong for more than 2 years.NEVER buy IBM. Not one. Bad news."
1,Beware of reliability.,My 75GB Model DTLA307075 IBM hard drive crashed after 4 months of use. The head mechanism was broken and I had to send my hard drive away to have the data recovered costing thousands. Other people that I know have had great results with the exact same type of drive.
1,terrible,"the outfit does not fit my dog like in the picture, and the pom poms came apart there was stips of it all over"
2,Jong on Miller....and lots on Jong & society,"The title says ""Erica Jong on Henry Miller"" but it should read ""How Henry Miller impressed & influenced Erica Jong"". This book is completely subjective, filled with impressions Jong has digested from reading Miller's works, as well as from correspondence & conversations with him. It is mostly blind praise & back-patting, loaded with Jong's running commentary on American morals on such topics as sex & lesbianism. While of intrest to fans of Jong & Miller, reading this work to find out about Henry Miller's life & works will leave you still needing to find out about Miller's life & works."
4,For any who want more vocals than instrumentals,"OUMOU is a two-cd set tribute to the range of her skills: Oumou has been described as the 'songbird of Wassoulou', and is Mali's diva.Her roots lie in the musical traditions of Southern Mali, and her songs comment on social problems in women's lives as well as more universal metaphors of heroism and the human condition."
4,Very addictive,"Starting, building, and refining your city can easily use up a Saturday afternoon and evening. My only complaint is in the difficulty of the scenarios with battles. Eventually, an enemy will show up that's twice as strong as your forces, and once their routed, you might as well quit the game because nothing can save your city. Building cities in peaceful areas is much more fun."
5,Topics I talk about with my best girlfriends BUT...,"... we don't talk about brownies or The Gap. Andrews explores human mating strategies from an intelligent female perspective. Sex and evolutionary psychology are the common thread in these compelling nested story lines -- our most primal urges filtered through a highly sophisticated cortex. Trine Erotic is one of a kind -- analytical, creative, seductive, profound... brilliant."
1,Spoilt Expat Tai Tai writes book,"While living in Shanghai I made a point of buying memoirs or oral histories of the old China-Coast communities. This book was the least informative, most fatueous one of the lot. Ms. Sergeant obviously had impeccable connections through her husbands business contacts into the upper reachs of the old Hong families and managed to say nothing interesting. Not even gossip."
5,This CD is a classical aural delight.,"""Music of the French Masters""CD Information Music genre: classical earBuzz Review: Timothy John Smith's CD, Music of the French Masters, is a classical aural delight. Smith's touch on cello is dynamic, intuitive, and emotional as he interprets pieces from composers, Saint-Saens, Faure, Debussy, and Ravel. The recording, performed live, is clear and full of range - while Smith's playing warms and flows. Accompanying Smith is the gifted pianist, Kay Kim, who's support of Smith during this performance is attentive and strong. Highlights include Saint-Saens' ""Allegro Appassionato, Opus 43, mp3'd here. Other highlights include Debussy's ""Romance and Faure's ""Elegie"" - which moves romantically and boldly and is one of the finest performances of the record. Relaxing, gentle, and moving - Timothy John Smith's musicianship and sense of line direction within these classic French pieces is tremendous and the CD is a great addition to any music lover's collection."
2,The risks of a live recording,"Live performances always preserve the emotion, the excitement and the risks of a challenge; in this case, the risks are huge; four sonatas per night is a Herculean task and, before a sonata cycle like this one, it's hard to keep the balance and the tempo. Sometimes, Tatiana is too intense and the pedaling excess is disturbing; as far as ornaments are concerned, it seems she can't play them ""a tempo"" and rubato turns to be a way to solve the technical limitations; as the listening goes on, you'll find too many wrong notes, wrong passages and wrong chords; this may explain the almost cold reaction from the audience. Here and there you'll hear someone's caughing or sneezing, a very low frequency noise and some differences in the piano sound. I think Nikolayeva could have left a better legacy recording this cycle in the studio and should have kept these live tapes in the cans."
5,Wonderful entertainment!,"This Australian production of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" is totally hilarious. I would only recommend it to those who are not G&S; purists. I'm sure that Gilbert would be rolling in his grave if he were to see it. However, I'm always happy to have fun with ""camped up"" versions of G&S; productions as well as those true to the original production.Jon English makes an unforgettable and totally hilarious Pirate King. Simon Gallaher, (Frederick), as well as Helen Donaldson make a beautiful couple. The entire cast and orchestra are outstanding.I highly recommend it!!Laurie"
1,Should be with apologies to G&S,"This production was abysmal. I turned it off after watching the miserably feeble attempt of enhancing the Major General's song by adding a pathetic string of rhyming words after the last stanza, as if Sir Gilbert's libretto needed any improvement. Pirates has been popularized for modern audiences many times, most notably, the well done 1980's production starring Linda Ronstadt, but this version is hard to bear. The Major General's daughters look like they stepped off the set of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Pirate King seems unsuited to his role despite his histrionic posturing. On the whole, the production is ham-handed, campy and sure to disturb the eternal rest of those venerable gentlemen whose brilliance of wit and musical genius gave it birth."
1,Pure Deception !,"I bought this DVD having purchased the Australian Opera DVD of Patience, which I found to be excellent. This version of Pirates is simply AWFUL; it is a parody on Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, having almost nothing to do with the original work. The so-called music has been entirely rescored, and is abominably bad; the acting is hammed-up slapstick; the dialogue has been greatly modified, and in many spots, Gilbert's text completely disappears. Some of the cast appear to be moderately decent singers; unfortunately, their talents are not allowed to shine in this version.I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone who is a lover of Gilbert and Sullivan."
3,Not the same company as OA Patience and Mikado,"If you are expecting a performance by the same production company that performed the Australian Opera/Opera Australia ""Gondoliers"", ""Patience"", ""Mikado"", and ""Pinafore"" this will disappoint. Taken on its own merits, I think it's hilarious in a Buster Keaton kind of way but others disagree. It's certainly not a great (or even particularly good) performance from a musical viewpoint, and the stage is incredibly small but there's a comedic energy to it that compensates for quite a lot.Opera Australia is performing ""Pirates of Penzance"" for the 2006/2007 season so I would expect a DVD of the new production around the middle of 2007."
5,GREAT,"As an Amazon product I found this version of Gilbert and Sullivan of ""The pirates of penzance"" ( Austrailian ) absolutely fantastic"
3,A Different Pirates,"We really do enjoy watching this DVD, but I have to say at my first viewing it struck me as a very bad joke. Once the initial shock had worn off I really began to enjoy it, most of it that is. The main reason I'm writing this review is to object to the performance of General Stanley. This character makes me angry every time we see it. This goof is trying so hard to be funny it's embarassing to watch. Thank God his parts can be fast forwarded. Otherwise the production is fun, providing you accept the fact that it really is a parody of one of G&S's best."
5,Australian opera Pirates of Penzance,Saw this production on UK channel 5 TV. Absolutely fabulous. The official reveiws are too understated it is even better than they say.Just had to get a DVD so we can watch it again and again. (nb. thr DVD is the US NTSC standard but it plays ok on my Philips DVD/VHS uk video machine.
1,Awful Production,Quite the worst 'Pirates' I have seen - badly sung - unfunny gags - all in all a travesty. A 'chorus' of three ladies !! If you've seen this you haven't yet seen The Pirates of Penzance.
1,A poor performance of Gilbert & Sullivan,"This version of Pirates of Penzance is a long way from what most it expect. While most of the songs are incorporated in the musical, the acting and singing are not up to Goilberty and Sullivan Standards. Would recommend reviewing several other versions before ordering this one.Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance / Jon English, Simon Gallaher, Helen Donaldson, Toni Lamond, Derek Metzger, Tim Tyler, Craig Schaffer"
5,Wonderful For A Light Day Of Exercise,"I did this workout today because I had a headache and I didn't feel like doing any of my step aerobics or low-impact aerobics workouts. But I still wanted to do something to move my body. This was just right because it wasn't too strenuous. I really enjoyed it. I had a little trouble with some of the moves, but nothing too difficult. I could still move. I know next time I'll do even better. It is really wonderful to still be able to do some form of light exercise when you just don't feel all that great. The production quality is excellent. I like working out one-on-one with Scott. The setting was very relaxing, even in the studio. Scott has a very low-key manner about him. He is calm and encouraging. I like that in an instructor. He is very motivating. This is an excellent addition to a regular exercise library."
2,Misleading title...,"I mistakenly assumed with a title of ""DISCOVER Tai Chi"" that Mr. Cole was going to teach me the traditional moves of Tai Chi. This DVD appears to be an individual's idea of an aerobics program using Tai Chi moves. I've only been stationed in one place that offered lessons and fell in love with Tai Chi, but only had time to attend for the first few moves. I've read a couple books describing the art, but thought I'd benefit from being shown the moves. This is definitely NOT the aide I was looking for.This guy is probably a great modern dancer and aerobics instructor, but he races through his moves with little instruction or explanation of what one should be experiencing; proper breathing, stance, muscle concentration etc.Don't recommend it unless you're bored with your current workout and know Tai Chi well."
4,Worth it..,"This is a great dvd for the beginner. After doing it a few times, you pick up the moves easily, so it doesn't bore you to death with explanations of how to do the actual moves. So in this aspect, its' great.I would like a more advanced work out like this, so hopefully the next level will be coming out soon. But there is really nothing else out on the market.There is the workout to music, once you learn the routine, which I use all the time now.Great product just wish the next level was available. Scott are you listening?!!"
3,"""Discover Tai Chi"" not for beginners","I was really excited about trying Tai Chi, so I was a little disappointed by ""Discover Tai Chi"". Scott Cole is personable enough, but his instruction leaves something to be desired. I found it hard to follow the movements, even after viewing the DVD several times. You get a little of the feeling that you are being taught basic math by a nuclear physicist. The camera also switches angles at inopportune moments, which makes it hard to follow the movements.Overall, the scenery is great, the soundtrack relaxing, and even though you may not be following the movements exactly, it will leave you with the nice, relaxed feeling you get after a low intensity workout. I get the feeling that this might be a great DVD for someone who is already familiar with the basics of Tai Chi, but if you are looking to really learn Tai Chi, as I was, you may be better off with a workout more geared toward beginners."
2,A letdown,"I have 3 of Scott Cole's Tai Chi workout tapes. I was very happy with the other two Scott Cole Tai Chi workout DVDs that I use. I have to say that this one is disappointing to say the least. In my opinion, I shouldn't have bought it in the first place. I enjoy the slow meditative movements involved in traditional Tai Chi and this DVD is none of that. I was better off buying a Cardio workout or a Billy Blanks Tae Bo DVD if I wanted to have a nice traditional weight loss workout."
4,Tai Chi for the Dyslexic at Heart,"This video features a tai chi introduction that is not exactly traditional. It is front view oriented though. This is usually bad for people who cant translate what they are seeing into body motion. But you can mirror him exactly and he calls out the actual leg or arm u are using if you mirror him. He'll raise his left hand while your raising your right and he'll say ""right hand"". This is enough reason to recommend it. Even if its simplified, even if he's a little smarme. Its easy to mimic from the start. Not a struggle that your going to throw down after one try because theres no one there to straighten you out."
1,Not a typical Fern Michaels book,"I have to agree with several of the other reviewers. This is a poorly written book, and yes it is typical soap opera stuff. Her sisterhood books are usually very good. I have enjoyed many of her other books too, but this is more like a Danielle Steele book (not good). Seemed like she was filling pages with words just to lengthen the book."
1,Cheap Imitation,"I've barely started this book and am already disgusted. I see several reviewers agree. I don't know why I keep reading this author, she knows more about dogs than she does people. Someone would strip out of her Armani clothes to wrap up puppies? and run around in her underwear?The dialog between the 23 yr old half brothers and their father 20 years older is juvenile at best. Do middle age males really pump their fists in the air and say yessss. You get the idea. Pass this jewel by."
3,"Play the game before you review it, please","Okay, so it's not the most spectacular game concept around. It is definitely a ""bubba game"" catering to the mass market. Hard core gamers mock it.But, have any of those gamers actually played this game?I have. It's not my type of game, but I can see how it would be fun. Check out the screenshots: it's pretty funny watching a bull kick a cowboy sky high. The graphics are actually decent. It's not like this is some Wizardworks piece of garbage; it's Sierra, and Sierra makes quality games.So, yes, it's not a sophisticated work of art like Deus Ex or System Shock 2. It won't keep you playing for hours and hours like Diablo 2. But it's a fun little diversion, it's fun, and it does a great job satisfying a niche. Those who are into bull riding and rodeos will really like this game.My question is, are people who are really into rodeos and bull riding also computer owners? Apparently so, because Sierra made Professional Bull Rider 2..."
1,"Oh joy, another bad game....","Have you ever watched water boil? It's a lot funner than this game. You're supposed to stay on the bull for about 9 seconds, that's a lot longer than you should play this game."
1,Fool's Gambit,"Alright, this game is the biggest joke in the computer gaming world. The thought that Sierra could stab the backs of every gamer in an attempt to make the 'big-audience sell-out' game is sickening and sad. This game has been renounced by EVERY major computer game reporting agency and has been literally laughed off the shelves. But hell, if you always wanted to be a bull-rider, or even a bull, and you like poorly designed slip-shod games, buy it, quick. Or take your money and give it to the homeless guy down the street. His little dance of joy should be 10x's more entertaining than the 2.1 seconds of joy you'll get from this game. And that's from the title screen... Remember folks a feature is PLAYING AS THE BULL!!!---silently weeps---"
3,Jack lavender,Those obsessed with the older Crimson aesthetic could do a lot worse with melodies far from dull but short on amazing and extras that compliment rather than condescend.
4,It's useful when you travel ...,This cooker is really useful when you travel and you are deprived of rice for days. You can have this in your hotel room and cook your own rice... It takes about 30 minutes for 2 cups of rice.
3,Rice burned at the bottom,"Okay for the price, but beware the bottom gets burned and stick to the pan when reheat, not a non stick like the expensive cooker."
4,Small but effective,"I didn't realize how small this cooker was going to be when I ordered it. Despite my initial disappointment in its very small size, I am overall very happy with it's performance and versatility. I have cooked rice & quinoa in it with excellent results and steamed vegetables in it too. It's the perfect size for one or two people and it's a great value."
3,Ideal for 2 People,"Its a good one for 2 people, the only flaw it has is that it doesn't have ""WARM"" indicator (orange), it has only one indicator(Cook-Red) and after cooking rice it just turns off. Would have appreciated more if it also has WARM option, but, with this price and Brand Name (PANASONIC)I would recommend it(only if it comes with free shipping/super saver shipping)."
3,Just about right,The cooker is really smaller than it looks in the picture. It was ideal for 3 grads like us but I am not sure if it will be sufficient for a family. It is convenient to cook though cleaning can be a little tedious.Decent buy.
2,misleading,"Well here's the deal. The picture shows a black plastic sensor, but what the ship is a gray one. Big difference. Black ones are a prerecall type that works better in older model 7.3 engines. Technicly they are not shipping the wrong part so you get what you pay for but if you are searching for the elusive black CPS for ford 7.3 diesel, this is NOT the place to get it."
5,Works Great!,"Bought this motor months ago and its still working. Needed a replacement motor for my Broan bathroom fan that burnt out. The shaft was slightly shorter than the one that was in there before, but it still works great. No problems at all installing it, just had to reinstall the shaft in the opposite direction so the fan I have would blow the air out instead of in(CW rotation). Definitely recommend buying if you have a Broan bathroom fan that's separate from the heat lamp. In fact, I came on here to buy another one because I had another one go out on me."
2,Total Soft Core.....,"If you're looking for something you can find late night on Cinemax, this is your movie...if you're looking for something more, this is not the one for you. I was very disappointed in this movie, I thought from the description that it would be very steamy, it didn't even get me stimulated, or hold my interest."
3,Good movie but little disappointed,"Overall the movie is good but it's little bit short, only 55 min.The picture on the cover and the bonus feature(behind the scence)are totally not related to the movie. So, don't let those two things make you buy ths DVD. This is why I review this movie as good movie but disappointed."
5,Excellent.,"The title pretty much says it all. This DVD contains four stories that play out as urban legends and are loaded with great sex scenes. The stories are all good and more entertaining than what you usually find in softcore.There are fourteen sex scenes spread throughout the DVD's sixty minute running time. All scenes are boy/girl. Some of them are short, but still, this whole thing is almost start to finish, non-stop sex. The sex scenes were excellent and very explicit. There are seven women who participate in the sex scenes. All of them were attractive and did a good job. The only two I'd seen in other softcore were Susan Featherly and Teanna Kai, everyone else was new for me.I recommend this one."
3,"Pretty good lost Gem, but.....","I bought this cd off the fact that it looked pretty cool, I've seen it in the past at other cd places and was really overpricred, luckily I found it for cheap and tried it out...I was happy with it. Thier best I believe is 5 dollars a ticket. Their set back is they almost ""over-Psych"" the songs. They do a cover of Tobacco Road, and at first listen you could not even tell it is the same song, due to all the Psych-out. I still would suggest it if you want to try somthing new...Just don't pay more than 20 bucks for it."
5,House of Troy portable Piano Lamp,"This product arrived promptly and in excellent condition. The lamp gives excellent light, is easy to turn on and off as well as dim. The height was perfect for the music rack of the organ for which it was purchased. It is esthetically pleasing in design and the lovely polished brass finish fits with the surrounding decor. The adjustable lamp fixture helps to direct the light exactly where it is needed for best coverage of the music rack."
1,try something else by this author,"This is my third Saramago novel, and I was sorely disappointed. Too little going on too late, too meditative, too didactic, and what's worse, because of the lack of punctuation I was trapped, and couldn't skim it."
5,Nobel Notable Pleasure,"""The Cave"" has the simplicity and truth of a fable. The lack of paragraph breaks encouraged the two of us to read aloud to each other, in part to make sense of it and then because the style invited our participation. We enjoyed the kindness of each character - including the dog. I can't recall a book which had me smiling so often; one which I only put down because I wanted to make it last as long as possible. We discussed it for hours."
3,A Little Slow.,I found the action a little slow and the long paragraphs hard to follow. It did open me up to a new writer and an experience that was new to me. I read it because it is this month's book for by book club.
4,Run-on and read this,"One long run-on sentence of wonderful and complex writing. This book requires some thought and it definitely helps to familiarize yourself with Plato's allegory of ""The Cave""."
2,"too many words, too little story","Disappointing. This book is extremely tedious. The narrative, just like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, is comprised of long sentences, with many commas and no paragraphs. However, unlike Marquez, this book seems to stretch into a 300 page novel a story that could be written as a 10 page short story. I would venture to guess that no less than 50 pages are dedicated to describe the dog's thoughts..."
2,The Cave,"Very dark and strange storyline. While the book attempts to present an existential perspective, it falls short.While the writing style is possibly stylish; I found the run-on sentences and endless paragraphs difficult to read."
1,Vastly Overrated,"Massively long blocks of text with little punctuation that interchange thoughts and spoken phrases betweeen multiple characters. The plot is slow-moving and not very intersting. The dog is the most pleasurable character in the book. If you want to read this book, bring your own pen so you can add in the appropriate punctuation.My overall assessment: commendable style but annoying overall."
2,Disappointing,"I know, those who love Saramago unconditionally will be upset at this assessment, but this book could easily have been a short story or novella and got the same points across while being more to the point and powerful.I guess coming straight off Blindness, which, to me, is one of the best books ever written, this one just came up short (or long, actually).Also, and everyone has commented on this aspect of the book, but glowingly, the comment on modern capitalism and the contrast between the center and the potter are making points so OBVIOUS that they almost make no point at all. Capitalism bad. Little guy good. It's that simple. I think he could've been a little more subtle.I will say, I loved the character development and the idea of the ""Center"" (although, like I said, it's significance was painfully overt). What I didn't like was the ending, because I think it was cryptic for its own sake and didn't make the rest of the story add up."
4,Flado's great round overshadowed by Norman's collapse.,"Years from now, golf fans will look back at the 1996 Masters as the greatest collapse in Greg Norman's infamous carreer of final round failures. Norman clearly played the best through the first 3 rounds as he marched to a 6 shot lead, but, as the saying goes, the Masters begins on the back nine on Sunday, where Nick Faldo played some of the most precice golf in the history of Augusta National. Although this Masters will undoubtedly be remembered Norman's folly, Nick Faldo deserves credit for the exceptional golf required to win a Masters."
3,Not recommended for an experienced programmer,"David Black must have been paid by the word. He could have distilled out 5 to 10% of the verbiage and had an easier to read book. But, if you like a rambling writing style you'll think this book is great.The material was covered well but there were too many unnecessary parenthetical phrases, adjectives and adverbs.Example: ""This, too, prints ""Hello"". Apparently the variable abc also contains ""Hello"", thanks to having had str assigned to it.""Would be easier to understand if it were written;This, too prints ""Hello"" because abc is assigned to str."
1,Disappointed...,I am new to rails. Before we can do any exercises or practices that come with the book we need to setup the environment correctly. There is no help for this part but instead the author asks you to search the answer on the internet. I read many technical books before but this is the first time I get very frustrated only at chapter 2.
5,Any Rails Developer should start here first,I am upto chapter 11 of the book and decided to go ahead and write this review. I believe that any aspiring Rails developer needs to go through this book first to get the most out of the Rails framework. A basic understanding of Ruby language that is geared towards facilitating the learning process for Rails framework is what this book is meant for. And it delivers.
2,Not enough Rails,"My expectations for the book may have been too high but I have mixed feelings. The book is 470+ pages but only a little more than 100 pages are devoted to Rails. As a Ruby starter book, it was ok but it missed the mark for Rails. By the end of the book I did create a simple shopping cart application with hyperlinks and partial pages but that was about it.I did learn that ""id"" and ""..._id"" are special field names, and table names must be plural. And one obscure sentence on page 387 mentioned that a field named ""created_at"" creates a current timestamp during inserts. Are these the only special names within Rails? Also, how do I work with complex tables which have multiple foreign keys to the same table?This book left me frustrated. It teaches you how to extend Rails but doesn't adequately show what's already there. If you want a Ruby book with some Rails thrown in, it's pretty good. If you want a hard-core Rails book, this isn't it."
3,"A slow paced, albeit interesting read","I found this book to be rather slow paced and not super rich in actual content. The information conveyed is often not that interesting, or simply self-evident. Nevertheless the book does have some bits and pieces that are interesting, perhaps as a side read to Programming Ruby book, or the Rails Agile Web Development book. I feel that for a daily ruby programmer this book is somewhat extracurricular. And as such it mostly succeeds."
2,Was not impressed,I was not impressed with this book. It's worth reading only because there are so few Ruby on Rails books. There is too much basic Ruby and not enough Rails in this book. I much prefered the Agile Web Dev with Rails.
4,Serves its purpose,"This book is not meant for a programmer who already has knowledge of Java , C++ or any other object oriented programming. However it introduces Rubys object oriented programming in a way I had never seen before.I had no problems reading the book. Quit well written."
4,Excellent Ruby Reference,"For last couple of years, I have mainly rely on Dave Thomas'""Programming Ruby"", but I found this book complementary to DT's book. Though, this book covers Ruby basics such as basic constructs, expressions, exceptions, YAML, etc, but not as much detail as DT's book. Also, it didn't cover xml, cgi, network, threads, drb, testing and continuation. However, it covered a number of other topics such as collections, singleton methods, blocks/lamdas, eval, etc. in much more detail. The only disappointment was that I found link to Rails a bit weak. Though, this book had a few examples of Rails code and Rails application code, but it didn't cover much of the internals of Rails especially metaprogramming and DSL, which is the heart of Rails framework."
2,I don't quite like it,"this maybe against the popular opinions, but the book is thick on author's philosophical thinkings (and the author is obviously fond of) on how various things are tied together, but thin on the actual things that you can do, and what to do. You have to wade through bunch of such mommy and apple pie stuff to get the point, which is a a pain. On the other hand, if you have plenty of time, and want to take it to savor the good of either ruby or rails or their interconnects, maybe it is the right book."
2,"Good Pictures, But Not History","The author should be commended for assembling this collection of old photographs and postcards. They make a valuable addition to Shenandoah documents. The book is no history however. In writing about this beautiful place, the author dismisses the tragedy in its making. Frederick repeats --sometimes verbatim-- discredited myths originally meant to justify the evictions and forced relocations used in creating the park. That archeological research is available makes the mistake indefensible.For anyone interested in the past of the Shenandoah, this book's photos make a good companion to a history such as Darwin Lambert's ""Undying Past of Shenandoah National Park""."
1,Maybe Later: One Girl's Struggle with the English Language,"What incredible drivel. The subject matter obviously is autobiographical . . . which, in many cases, can be riveting reading. However, with ""Maybe Later,"" it's obvious that the author has lived a life only she could ever construe as interesting. The writing skills are so poor that one wonders how the author could be teaching English to America's youth, when it is apparent that a basic high school writing class is what she needs to attend. I have reviewed over 2,200 books in my career and this is, by far, the worst. Don't waste your money on this juvenile trash."
1,this book sucks,"the book was terrible. i being a twelve year old, found the content to be incredibly inappropriate and stupid. she was way too informative, and lame. the book wasn't worth the two dollars i got it discounted for (yay salvation army!). don't waste precious minutes or even a penny reading this lame excuse for a book. i look at her in a completely different way. i mean, sure, she already sucks as a teacher, but to display your lack of knowlege for the whole world is sad. ps. ditch the skull jacket and pigtails."
3,Spellcoats,"This book is odd and amazing at the same time. The odd part is the numbers of setings and spirits. The amazing part is how the author describes the character's thoughts, feelings and wants with great detail. Tanaqui, the heroin, is very interesting. The setting is set in prehistoric Dalemark. Tanaqui's siblings all have enticing and magical powers. Kankredin the vicious villian is very powerful and tries to destroy Tanaqui and her siblings. This book is very interesting, I recommend this book."
3,I was dissapointed...,"I guess it really depends on what kind of books you like, but I was dissapointed. If you are the type of person who likes fast-paced books, you should not read this book. Although the last 2 in this series were really good, this one was too slow for my tastes, and I'm sure it would seem slow to other people, too."

2,"Not bad, but needs improvements","This game is a good flight combat sim, but there are a few things that could be changed. First of all, it is very difficult to control the plane if you do not have a joystick. Second, it is also hard to get the enemy into view in order to shoot him down. Overall, i thought this game to be more frustrating than fun, and it also does not incorporate with the rest of the Red Baron series. It tells you nothing of how to control the plane which is difficult in the 1st place. Being a long time player of Red Baron games, my personal favorite is ""Hunt for the Red Baron"". You can find it at www.fiendishgames.com and it is VERY VERY fun. Curse you Red Baron, however, is not at all worth the money and I do not recommend anyone to waste their cash on it. Save yourself the frustration! Do not buy this game!"
3,So So for a Real Gamer,"This WWI era plane sim is unbelivibly hard to control. The planes don't have rear gunners. Also, the game gets repeditive. On the good side it has good graphics for its time and realistic planes and iterface. Overall 3 Stars."
3,A Wicked Story? Maybe..,"This one I would rank personally right around Clash By Night. The love aspect is not strained at all but very natural. What I didn't like, however, was the fact that Partridge chose to write more of Kyra Damon then of Dan Cody, The Crow. It was a good try, for a crow story but it didn't work this time. Also, do all of these authors borrow from each other? One of the supporting characters, Emily Carlisle, her last name is the name of the avatar in Clash By Night. And I also thought Emily was too open to accepting Cody's situation. Otherwise, the story flowed well from one point to another, despite a few disappointing endings"
2,Disappointing,This book was ok until the end. The end was a major let-down and seemed hurried. I also did not like the fact that Lilith has the grimoire *and* Raymondo.
2,A terrorist threat...to your money,"If you're thinking about buying this game, make yourself a favor, and don't do it. Save those bucks in your piggy bank or spend them on anything else. Trust me, I own this game and I've unsuccesfully tried to trade it or sell it. Why? read Jamie's comments for a start. Want more? How about officers that try to walk thru a wall instead of around it? Terrorist and hostages that run to the edge of the screen and dissapear no matter how many swat officers you have surrounding them? There are too many hot keys that you have to memorize in order to supposedly play easier and better, but they don't do the job and is hard to remember them. Beware! these are just a few of the many problems you will face when you try to play this game. And save those bucks, because the only terrorist threat that this game poses is to your money"
3,"good, but it could be better","i thought it was a pretty good game, but it could be better. the slow mode is not quite slow enough. the interface was somewhat slow. a lot of little... bugs. like being able to talk through walls. the the interface was too complex. there are too many commands to remember and to toggle through in combat. the units are hard to distinguish between in combat. there is not much exciting action on the LAPD side. the terrorist side is somewhat hard to play and seems to be unevenly matched aginst the LAPD AI. when you fail a mission, it wont tell you what you did wrong or didnt do. so when you replay it over and over and over again, it just gets boring. the last missions for both sides are very hard. i cant beat the last swat mission, even if i dont loose any men and still able to accomplish the objective."
2,Swat 2 an o-kay game,"Swat 2 was an ok game. You can't tell if the police are terrorists or not. The graphics aren't that good either. I would deafintly not consider getting this game, and the scenerios aren't that great either."
5,Don't wait to get this book.,"Medicine Recall has been an invaluable source of quick, high-yield information both in clinic and as a reference. It is thorough, accurate and up to date. It is written in a very clear question-answer format that you will definitely encounter on rounds. I advise all students to avail themselves of this resource at the beginning of their third year if not sooner. It was even helpful for board preparation."
2,Not a good fit,"These were recommended to pair with Gavin Elite shoes but they did not fit correctly, the bolts were too short to fit into the shoe"
4,Wear out in 3000 miles great product,"great product, maybe I haven't bought any other cleats yet since I have only been using these cleats. I have just bought a new pair after using my first pair for an entire year(rode about 6000 miles) all in all it is a great product but based on what some others are saying i am giving it a 4 out of 5 due to the fact it wears out and is 20 more dollars you will have to pay eventually."
5,Excellent,Saved some $$$ from buying retail. These are the exact same as except those at a discount. Would buy again.
5,Shimano sm-sh11,"These cleats are a great product! They are very easy to install and use. The price is also unbeatable, and they were shipped in no time."
4,Maybe i should have stayed with yellow,I got to use the red's the other day for a 2 hr ride. I used the yellow before with the float but wanted to try these. First thing i noticed they don't clip in as well as the yellow's. I'm not sure what it could be.. i had my binding's set to the loosest settings with the yellows. The yellows seemed to clip in more solidly .. these seem to unclip too easily maybe i have to tighten the binding down more.. on my ride i was feeling too timid to poor the power on afraid a foot would come out of the pedal.. on a ride last year there was this guy ahead of me on a hill.. when he poured on the power his right foot at the top of pedal stroke came out.. the whole bike seemed too turn right and through him into the pavement.. very weird accident to say the least.. couple more rides i should find out more and update this
5,Had them for years...,"These cleats are awesome. I bought them 5 years ago and figured they would last a few months before needing replacing. I don't ride too much, but I've been a weekend warrior for years. These cleats have lasted me a long time and are especially awesome when climbing hills. Definitely recommend."
4,Shimano Cleat,"Well, they work and wear pretty well. Have done a few triathlons and a duathlon with these and they have held up pretty well. If you buy Shimano pedals, do you have any choice? Anyway, they are good cleats and can take some heavy use."
2,"OK, I guess, but I will not go with this style again...","These are OK clips, but it's 50-50 on whether you will clip-in at the first shot. And when you do not clip on that first try and you need to go fast right now...can be pain in the crotch. These plastic clips will ware out in 2500 miles(on your standing foot) and require another 20 dollar purchase. I like most everything Shimano makes, but these are not their best effort."
5,No brainer,Bought The item through Amazon after researching prices online and through local bike stores. Price was right. Item was received on time and in good condition. I am a very satisfied customer.
2,Shimano Bicycle Cleats,"I have been using these cleats for about 4-years...Just replaced the yellow (floating) with the red-trim (fixed). I guess I am a glutten for punishment! Both configurations are almost impossible to clip into, first try. What is perhaps worse about the red (fixed) cleat is that in my opinion it needs to be very acurately aligned to avoid knee injury.Overall, am most unhappy about the cleat-pedal design because I have not yet learned to simply ""snap in"" on the first try! Shimano SM-SH10 SPD-SL Cleat Pair, Fixed"
5,This Cd Rocks,This Cd is the best Cd In the world. It is better than Blink 182 and all those other bands like Limp Bisket they suck I escpecially like the song La La La You should by this 10 star Cd On a rate from 1-100 I rate it a 1000. Buy this CD
4,Pricey,"This collection can be bought on GOG.com any given day for under $6, and will work on win7. Today the 18th of July it,s under $3 to buy."
2,A hackneyed repot with limited critical interpretation,"This book is a popular retelling of the lives of four major figures, all of whom were marked by the horror of the Great World War I. Gene Smith, a well-known author, puts these lives in the dramatic context of the First and, for Petain and Eden, Second World War. There is little that ties these four lives together, and the book is strong on atmosphere but weak on analysis and interpretation. Smith's thesis centers around his proposed study of the reason for demise of such great men. He cites this reason as being WWI, which pulled these men from the history in which they were so great, and placed them in a 'new' world that would require new men with new minds to develop. A strong point thus is made, though Smith does little to give any fresh perspectives whatsoever in his analysis."
4,Really good book,"I was really into this book from the beginning. I didn't like to duke in Miracles, but he was vastly improved in Devotion. Maria preached a little too much I thought. She claimed to want to get away from her father, the Vicar, but she just kept preaching to the duke. I didn't like the ending at all. It ended too abrubtly like the author didn't want to finish. Above all, I would recommend this book."
3,The author is a quitter!,"If you need a tidy ending to a story, don't read this book. When I got to the last page, I had to look at the binding carefully to make sure no pages had been ripped out. The story ends with no resolution between the main characters. A happy ending may be implied, but given the difficulties the hero and heroine have throughout the story there is plenty of room to assume things could still go awry. I lost so much respect for the author (whom I had until then been truly enjoying). If she cannot respect her readers enough to wrap-up the loose ends of the characters she got us so invested in, then I cannot give her a higher rating. And the sad thing is, I don't trust her not to do this in other books, so why would I bother to pick up another Sutcliffe novel? Badly done, KS."
1,Don't bother . . .,"This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's close. The characters lack depth. The dialog is stilted, and all too often the characters make speeches rather than conversation. Too much is told rather than shown, and the telling is stilted, too. How these two fell in love isn't quite clear. Too many elements of the plot simply didn't ring true, either. I, too, love the premise of the wounded hero who is healed, in every sense, by the love of the heroine. However, with these two people it simply wasn't believable, and with the writing being so formal there was simply too much distance between the reader and the story. If you're going to read it, I'd look for it in a used bookstore or the library before paying for a new copy."
3,"There's some good music here, but ...","If you're a big AC/DC fan looking for some pre-AC/DC hard rock, don't buy this. This is pretty standard '60s pop tinged with psychedelia, with some occasional hard rock flourishes. As an AC/DC fan from way back, I can tell you that most of the songs are but a curiosity; it certainly is interesting to hear Bon Scott's voice on this kind of material. There are about three or four songs that rise to the level of being fun to listen to more than once in a while, if you like pseudo-psychedelic '60s pop. And I must complain about the packaging. These songs are by two bands that Bon Scott was a member of; they are NOT Bon Scott solo tunes. You have to read the liner notes extensively to determine which songs are by the Valentines and which are by Fraternity, and even then, it's not 100% clear. As a music collector to whom such things are important, I am FURIOUS with the complete idiots who put this package together."
4,The history of legend,"I found the book to be a very nice read. The author makes you feel like he is sitting next to you telling you all these stories about a man whom he had a lot of respect for and his family, and all the triumphs and the tragedies that the Von Erichs had in their lives. Of course there will be some who will claim that it is all biased but then the author had the advantage of actually talking to Fritz and his family unlike the others who only had rumor and other totally unrelieable sources to base their ""truths"" about the Von Erichs on. For all Von Erichs fans, who want to get their side of their lives it is an enjoyable book to read"
1,In all fairness I did not finish the book,I was very excited to read this book based on other reviews and the short excerpt. I ready about 25% of it and that I had to push through. It was really difficult to develop a true interest in the characters and the plot. The attempted sexual tension became annoying and superfluous. I would definitely be interested in learning more about that area but not by reading this book.
2,Durrell has gotten old and it shows,"I have always admired Gerald Durrell as a writer; his zoological/ecological achievements, while very noteworthy, have not been so important to me when reading his books.From this standpoint, 'Aye-aye and I' was a great disappointment; the sparkling humor of 'Three Tickets to Adventure' and especially 'My Family and Other Animals' has all but disappeared. The author has gotten old and bitter and it really shows throughout the book. He keeps complaining about the degrading ecological state of Madagascar, his own health and other issues, and while his environmental concerns are undoubtedly valid, it makes the book a somewhat depressing read.Now if you have actual interest in lemurs, Madagascar or Durrell's scientific work, by all means go ahead and by this book. However, if you are looking for something entertaining, skip it and get some of his older works instead."
2,Could definitely use references identifying the content!,"When I first picked up this book at a used bookstore, I thought I would not be able to resist buying it. But my joy quickly turned into dismay as I discovered that the two people who compiled the book did a very unfortunate thing - they left out all the references! None of the many news items reproduced in the book is identified by source and exact date of publication. An incredible misjudgement on the part of the compilers who are both identified in the jacket as librarians! It is also a shame that the book has no index."
2,This should not be considered an album...,"I'll keep this short and sweet the way most people probably like to get their reviews. The album's content is tight, definitely the work we loyal fans have come to expect from Tragedy...however; my biggest beef with this so called ""album"" is the fact that it felt like I was listening to a bunch of snippets of the songs...only 6 tracks clock over 3 minutes...16 tracks and only 36 minutes of music. In my opinion, this is not worth the money. Next time he should wait until he can afford to pay for full songs before compiling something so sad."
4,"Nice Album, Too Short","I gave this a four star rating based on the fact that the album is so short. If it would have just had more verses. A lot of the trax are only a minute and a half and the longest track clocks in just over 3 minutes. Tragedy is on it as far as his verses are concerned. Overall I feel this album just need to be longer. But great release, the beats and the verses are well done."
3,Chyna Gets Naked,"Yeah, pretty much Chyna of the WWF/WWE getting naked for Playboy.A fantastic thing about 7 years ago."
1,not for my macbook,"This was to hold a drive taken out of my ibook that ""died"" Drive was one of the only things still working. 2 drive cases later & it still won't work & customer service is the worst. This is the one & only time I was displeased with Amazon & its vendor. I will persue this problem & try to resolve it through Visa."
2,Construction handbook in photos,"Published by Rizzoli under ISBN: 0847811522 and 0847811247, it has 256 pages. Disappointingly, Centre Georges Pompidou is presented on a few somewhat depressing or irrelevant B&W photos and illegible tech. drawings with white lines on black background. A few more projects are shown in that manner. Many photos show everything except architecture (good for social studies), or were made too close to the object showing too little of it, or - too far showing too much sky or foliage, incl. most of the B&W ones. There are not many plans and sections, and mostly too small and/or simplistic (incl. hand drawn). Technical aspect of structure is overemphasized and dominates photos like in a construction handbook. The fabric of architecture - space proportions and composition is very scarce. There is a lot of empty paper."
3,Good and Bad at once,How do I start? The monk is a nice addition but the fact that the 2 better characters are hidden in the game WITHOUT 'skins' to make them visually appealing was a drag. Network play is also available via using a text file with specific wording. The Barbarian was probably the most useful out of all 3 of the characters available in this expansion pack. I was very diappointed by the terrible levels added on to this. They did not fit in with Diablo at all. The new weapons and spells however ROCKED. ANd well.....Running in town ...that was worth the 20 bucks alone!
5,Great Expansion Pack,This expansion pack for Diablo was great. I liked it a lot better than Diablo 2 release. Great gaming experience and have played this over and over again as different characters.
2,"Some good parts, but mostly worthless.","I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The ability to cast Apocalypse and Nova and other high-level spells is great fun, but the added levels are a waste of time. In addition to that, I think Unique items are programmed to show up more frequently, which isn't as fun as the patient search for them was in Diablo. Get it for cheap if, and only if, you want to."
1,Lame,"I was expecting something good from the expansion even though it isnt multiplayer, the only reason to play diablo is the multiplayer. Dont buy this. Go get diablo ii"
2,ok I guess...not really worth it though,"Luckily I got this from a friend for a few dollars, so I didn'twaste bucks on it. If you haven't guessed, its not worth it. Theonly good additions are the ability to choose difficulty levels on single player games, and the new weapons and spells. The added characters are worthless, for all intents and purposes, and the added levels are pretty bland and not representative of Diablo. to make it more interesting find any diablo cheat site and look for hacker tricks to do interesting things like add a guy in a cow suit to the game. Otherwise, its a pretty dumb add-on."
2,Move along - play Diablo II instead,"The expansion was outsourced to Sierra Online and the quality from Diablo I was not maintained.The expansion does not really add anything: monsters seem out of touch, music, ending are nothing compared to the original. Skip this and go straight from Diablo to Diablo II which is another pure marvel."
3,Hellfire Patch Won't Work on 64-bit OS,"The 1.01 Hellfire patch, which is difficult to find but IS located on Sierra's FTP server, is a 16-bit executable. It will NOT work on 64 bit operating systems."
5,A spiritual feast for the eyes and the soul !,"I was on a spiritual pilgrimage in France in October 2000, and I toured most of the abbeys that are featured in this book. I did not see this book until after I returned from France, and I must admit that the photos in this text are the most impressive of all the books that I have viewed on Cistercian architecture. I love this book ! The photographer has been able to capture the peace, simplicity, and soul of these medieval monuments. How many photography books actually bring your spirit to a deeper level of tranquility? This one surely will. The introduction is beautifully written and was composed by The expert and scholar of Cistercian architecture. I also recommend another excellent book on this subject: Cistercians: Monks and Monasteries of Europe, by Stephen Tobin."
1,"Please Don't buy this, it is a Fire Hazzard!!",This charger could have burned the house down. Luckily I used it in the daytime instead of at night. I plugged it in and 10 minutes later I smelled something burning. When I checked the charger It was sparking and smoking. Thank God I didn't plug it in over night like I usually do when charging things. I would not recommend anyone to buy this dangerous item. When I let them know what happened I was told to give them a fax # so that I could get a return label for the item. I don't have a fax so I just trashed it.
3,Roomy yet compact,"This bag features a gussetted bottom so it stands up on it's own and has a roomy interior while not being too bulky. The texture of the materials it is made of on the exterior are fairly stain & water repellent when it was new, as more & more use occurs it softens and does not resist liquid/oily stains from handling as well. Attractive overall design."
4,Tamrac explorer 2 bag,Nice bag for my EOS DSLR camera. It nicely accommodates the camera body with 135mm zoom lens. The bag itself is very light. You may need a larger bag if you want to carry additional lenses and accessory.
3,camera bag,"much too small for my use--perfect for one camera, flash and an extra lens--very well made--"
5,great camera bag,Perfect for my Canon with zoom attached. Just what I needed to carry and access easily. The pockets are good for accessories too.
4,Good DSLR camera bag,This is a good DSLR camera bag. I wish it was just a tad bigger. My DSLR has a rather bulky battery compartment and fits very tightly inside. So I have to be careful when inserting it with a lens attached. I imagine it may loosen up with age. I like the compartments inside for memory cards. There is also room for two lenses in addition to the one attached to the camera. I think that overall it is a good value for the money.
5,Portable and compact,"I use this with my Nikon D90 and have been generally happy as a carry-around bag for the camera, and extra lens, and a couple of basic accessories like filters and lens cloths. It seems well made and compact. The shoulder strap is generally useful in most circumstances and there is a handle on top as well for grabbing the bag and holding it close.I've owned it for most of a year. It is a great size for going around in cramped quarters or when you are travelling very light. I found myself not liking it as much in times when I was going out on longer hikes or also needed to carry additional items like snacks. For that I use a backpack-style camera bag, but still use the explorer 2 for short around-town photo opportunities."
1,Product Description Very Misleading,"I didn't realize it when I ordered this 2 camera bag, but your website had the same size and dimensions for all the Tamrac Camera Bags. Even going by the name of this bag you can not possibly put two cameras with small lens on them in it with any feeling your gear is safe and protected.(way to small) After calling the Manufacurer and getting the true sizes of their bags I went to the 4 DSLR Messenger. This bag holds my Fuji S3 with a medium lens and an Nikon SB-800 on Camera nicely. After Checking your Website today the dimensions are now the packing box size used, which doesn't help a customer decide what works for them. As far as the quality of the Tamrac Bags they are all made very well. Quality and durable bags. I recommend going on line and finding your needs with the Manufacurer amd then ordering it from Amazon.Com....Tamrac Explorer 2 DSLR Camera Bag (Black)"
5,very interesting,i found the book very interesting and entertaining. there was also some very good information that you can talk about in parties and gatherings and start very interesting conversation.
4,A good book to choose to expand your mind.,"The X-Rated Bible has gaven me a new view of how i look at the bible. Not that it's in a bad way in it's teachings, but in a way that i can read the bible a bit more open minded and can get a better understanding. The churches won't give you a view like this, which is why i think this book is a good pick."
4,Realistic Look,"""The X-Rated Bible"" is a very interesting book. It gives a very realistic look at the raucous content of the Bible, and just maybe, someone's eyes will be opened to the reality of the over-rated book called the Bible. Only a closed-minded Christian would try to explain away the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, and the unrelenting vindictiveness in the Bible, as showing ""God's patience, love, kindness, and grace in using those same screwed-up individuals in trying to make the world a better place... on God's terms,"" as one reviewer has done. Christians claim that God is the creator, but look what a mess he created. What is depicted in the Bible is exactly the way the goat herders of the Bronze Age interpreted life. It is filled with stories they made up. If the words in the Bible are the words of a god, we're all in trouble.""The X-Rated Bible"" is worth reading."
2,Not what I expected.,"I had a book with this same title before and someone stole it. Ironic!! This isn't what I remembered; way too much of the real Bible, and not enough commentary and no humor. I will keep searching for the book I had before, which was more fun."
2,It's not what you think,"First let me qualify, I am not Bible lover.In fact, let's be honest, when I bought this book I was hoping to learn some steamy Bible stories. Instead, what I got is a sharp anti-Bible, anti-Christian polemic written by someone with several chips on his shoulder. Nothing exciting about that.It's not that he doesn't have a point here and there, he does in some places. He made me think about how Judaism was so obseessed with destroying paganism (which means perhaps paganism was more popular than we're made to think) and he made me think about double-dealing Christian and Zionist fundamentalists who claim they follow the word of God while supporting murder and mayhem in his name. So that's why I don't give it a total 1 - there's something to it, but it is not what I was looking for and not a book I desire to keep in my library.Suggest: Harlot by the Side of the Road instead."
5,Great concert DVD !!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great concert of Keith's most recent tour. Excellent sound & picture. Also has lots of back stage footage. Wal mart has tons of these and their only TEN dollars. get one!!
5,"Keith Urban: Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour Live","Keith is one of the best entertainers around. He is such a great musician and songwriter. Watching him is amazing and makes you like him even more. This is a great show, worth owning."
5,Very good compressor,This is an excellent heavy duty replacement compressor for 1988-92 GM truck models compared to auto parts stores junk. This unit is made in Korea and is a six cylinder compressor and cools as good or better than the original equipment. Easy to install but is slightly larger than the original unit. I didn't buy from Amazon since I told the mechanic NOT to use the free exchange offered by the auto parts store and specified AC Delco from another store. I also paid more than $300 for mine compared to the Amazon model so save some money and get a quality replacement unit.
4,The final Aeon Flux leaves you wanting more.,"Not as compelling as the first, but the art and dialogue are top notch. If this truly is the end of the animated Aeon Flux, then let us pray for a live action film to ressurect this strange and wonderful venue."
5,Beauty and *The Beast*,"Let me begin by affirming my anchorings in Buddhism; I am not a Christian, and I don't make a habit of reading books with heavy Christian undertones.This book was so good, though.Written from Lucifer's POV, this book takes the reader on a journey through the Devil's second Fall; not falling from Grace, but falling in love with a mortal woman.It's witty, funny, lusty, and downright painful. And the moral of the story might even make you rethink your definition of ""evil""..."
3,The Devil's Redemption,"I'm impressed. This books skims the surface of quite a few important theological questions that have been debated for centuries. Although I realize that this story is merely fiction, Ready's ideas are plausible and consistent in their biblical context. Despite my own convictions and beliefs, oddly enough, I found myself empathizing with the devil and began to feel sorry for him (as blasphemous as that sounds); to me, this is the mark of a good story-teller. My only criticism is that this book caters to a christian-centric audience, the bible's history is the basis of the story. Still, ""god loves seekers"", and it is apparent to me from this novel that Ready is a seeker."
2,Beatles Acoustic Guitar,"I really looked forward to getting this CD, but it ended up sounding like elevator music. Disappointed. The artist is quite accomplished. The arrangements left me a little dry."
1,Just a bunch of backglass pictures,"I was checking this book out at Borders. Its really acollection of artwork from pinball games organized by theme (cards, pool, ""vacation"" - which includes sports like skiing, etc). Not much info here and your not even sure if the prices are for the just the backglass or the whole game. The prices were way too low I thought compared the action Ebay's coin-op auctions. Ugly book with cheap feeling paper..."
2,Pretty much just backglass art...,"which is OK, if it's clearly labelled as such, which this book is not. The cover also implies that it's up to date to 1999. It's not. There are only a handful of machines from the 80's mentioned and absolutely none from the 90's (which is the peak era of pinball as far as playability goes.)"
3,used it in 1990,"i agree with the other 2 oldtime users. Back in the nineties this was the real deal. this protein is very good for cutting fat, but i need more time to see if it really packs on the muscle. i've been using it for two weeks. the verdict is still out on this new product hotstuff."
3,"Apologist for thugs, but an interesting story nonetheless","Although I strongly disagree with Mr. Felber's characterization of the American Mafia, I must admit this was an interesting story. It is also an intriguing look at man's constant struggle with good and evil, through the lens of a supposed true story. If everyone where completely honest with themselves, we would have to admit to similar struggles in our lives, although certainly not at the level Dr. Litner encountered/embraced.The bottom line is that the American Mafia is no different from the cowardly criminal street gangs popular in South Central LA or other parts of the country. So if you can get past Mr. Felber's unabashed apologetics on behalf of these thugs (I did, despite my low opinion of them), you will enjoy an overall good read."
1,"Being mean, rude and blowing people off will come back to haunt you","Wasn't a ""Dark Comedy"" - just DARK. Rick got what he deserved for being rude, mean, unscrupulous and careless. Unfortunately, his dumb daughter had to pay for it; with her life. The perverted ""BIGBOSS"" got what he wanted and got away Scott-free. The interviewee/fired waitress/storage space attendant's curse on Rick, worked. That's it. Lousy movie."
3,"No Classic, But Still a Great Time","If the guys from IN THE COMPANY OF MEN had been even more cartoonishly evil and crass, they would be the characters in this movie. And the fact is, those very traits make some bits in this satire absolutely hilarious.Both of the male leads in this film, Rick and Big Boss (who is half Rick's age), seem to compete for the designation of Bad Guy. Equally sleazy, both characters pull stunts that will literally make you gasp. The opening exchange between Bill Pullman and Sandra Oh may be the most politically incorrect scene in all of film. And it's classic.No need for a scene-by-scene analysis here. Suffice it to say, there's intrigue, there's back-biting, double-dealing, and really a lot more than I expected when I purchased the DVD from the $1 box at my local store. This is a fun movie with a truly shocking surprise ending (which makes no sense once you think it through). For fans of pointed social satire, this is a film for you."
3,Stylish and an interesting plot,"The only bad part is that it is too long. Still with its flaws, it's still an interesting story about karma."
1,the movie was HORRIBLE,"This movie had potential in the beginning, and left me hoping that it would lead to a great revenge story after the cruel treatment of Michelle. Way too many things in the movie just happened with no explanation such as the appearance of ""Buck"" and Rick knowing his daughter's password for her cybersex chat email address. It seemed like there was a bunch of stuff thrown into the plot haphazardly in order to make the plot seem more twisted, yet unrealistic. The fact that his daughter turns into a [...] right before she dies, and Rick barely shows distraught when he walks away from it is disturbing in a very forced way. The emotion in this movie is so shallow, and the lack of lighting at all is unnecessary to portray the sick atmosphere."
5,Perfect timing!,"This movie is amazing. It hits at the right time when corporate america is so corrupt. Bill Pullman gives an amazing performance as the title character of RICK! Anyone who has ever had to deal with a younger and arrogant boss will enjoy this film for here fantasy becomes reality. In the vain of Company of Men meets Swimming with Sharks, i highly recommend this daring film!!"
2,So-so,"For me, I didn't care for this one very much. It seemed to lack some of the talent I've seen in her other novels."
3,Actually not too bad,"I was surprised that this book was not as annoying as I figured it would be. It was a quick, easy read, albeit somewhat sappy & predictable. I didn't find a whole lot of repetitive descriptions, really. Cooper Winslow was quite nauseating and I wished Alex would have dumped him first, especially where he had to keep convincing her it was the best thing, gag! Towards the end, when Cooper & Valerie went to Boston (where I live) the airport is referred to as the 'Boston airpot' but in reality it is called Logan and nobody drives ""up the Cape"", least of all slowly.all in all, an alright story"
2,Boring!!!!,"This was the first Danielle Steel book I've ever read. People have told me to try out other Danielle Steel books because this one might not of been for me. I don't even know if I could bring myself to pick up another one of her books. I could barely get through it. It moved sop slowly, and it wasn't very interesting. I did appreciate Danielle Steel's style of writing, but it bored me to no end."
1,a mess,"Put this book down after only three pages. Once again, it is a string of words followed by a comma and then and. As I, and many of her other (probably now ex) readers have said-where is the editor? How this woman continues to sell books is beyond me. Does not rate even one star."
3,Somewhat redeeming given her last few novels.,"Not bad. I actually liked it. Though predictable and very typical of Danielle Steel, it was a pleasant read...light and fluffy. Good for an easy weekend read or a relaxing interlude."
3,I've Read Better,"I admit to being a die-hard Steel fan. I gladly purchase every book Danielle Steel puts out, but I have to admit I was disappointed in The Cottage. For me, the problem is the ending. It doesn't seem to flow right. Cooper Winslow sleeps with 20-somethings and is a self-centered man, yet at the end of the book Steel shifts gears out of nowhere and he falls for an older woman. This throws the reader in the opposite direction and the story is thus unbelievable. The cardinal rule of writing fiction is to make your story believable. But in The Cottage this reader isn't buying the ending. I was disappointed. I also thought of purchasing Summer in St. Tropez, the new small book that is currently out by Steel, but it seemed like a short knock-off of The Cottage so I think I will pass."
2,"Quick vacation read, implausible plot","A time passer to take with you on a trip, The Cottage was very implausible and I was very put off by Cooper and his lifestyle. I was so turned off by actor Cooper, especially by his affair with wealthy Alex and the 40 year age difference between them. It is unrealistic that Alex would be so dazzled by 70 year old Cooper that she would overlook his affairs with twenty-somethings and his sudden breakups with them. Alex even brushes aside and seems so nonchalant about Cooper's impending possible fatherhood and doesn't understand why Cooper's ex would want to keep the baby. Yet Alex seems to want to have children with Cooper anyway. I liked the secondary plot better with Jimmy and Mark who are much more likeable that I found myself very sympathetic to them. I agree with earlier reviewers that the ""instant bonding"" between Cooper and his long lost grown daughter was highly unrealistic."
3,Disappointing,"I am a devoted reader of Danielle Steel that is why when I finished this book I was truly disappointed. She chose to have Coop as the main character, a character that I found extremely selfish and way to old (70 to be percise)to be able to change so drastically. She then hooks him up with a 29 year old doctor,Alex. Okay Ms. Steel I can understand 10-15 years difference but 40 that is just [not right]!The book did not hold that much substance and this is why she is constantly repeating the same scenarios and doubts. I was expecting a lot more from such a great author. Hopefully her next one will be better."
2,Written by Danielle Steel?,"It is hard to believe that this book, as well as most of Ms. Steel's most recent works were written by the same author as her earlier bestsellers, such as Wanderlust and Zoya. The Cottage lacks any depth of character development, and the author has fallen into a pattern in her more recent works of stating the same character trait many times throughout the book, simply in different ways. As one who has always purchased the newest Danielle Steel novel as soon as it came out, I believe that I have just purchased my last. There are other newer, less popular authors writing books just as good as Danielle Steel's earlier ones who deserve receiving my book budget quite a bit more."
1,"Horrid Trash, Save your money","I have been reading Miss Steel since I was 18, my sister gave me Palamino. Over the last two years, I have found Miss Steel's books to be utter trash, she just keeps repeating herself over and over and over, page after page. It's like reading the same chapter 20 times. Miss Steel, what has happenned to to your ideas, like Jewels, Message from Nam, Zoya, wwhere the stories were actually good and interesting. I think you're the only author that seems to put out 4 to 5 books a year. Maybe slow it down and put out something of quality again. People work to hard to buy garbage like The Cottage and Bungalow. Shame on you, for becoming a lazy author. My advice to readers, find a new author to read, as Miss Steel is obviously out of ideas."
3,Agree with previous reviewers...,"First of all, and importantly, the romance in the story is really, really bogus. I won't get into that, but the story isn't as bad as it sounds. It reads rather easily, but the second bad thing in the story is the grammar. The Cottage - and previous Steel novels - have so much comma splices in it, it's enough to last someone a lifetime counting them."
3,The Cottage,"It was pretty predictable, more fluff than I like. I prefer Ms. Steele's historical books rather than modern time romances."
2,Disappointed,"I had never read a book by DS before. I got this book from a friend and after reading it, was very glad I did not pay for it. I found the story line to be too far out there and unbelievable. Everything seemed to happen to Coop all within months of each other; such as a gold digger says she is having Coop's baby and very soon afterward he finds out he has a full grown daughter he never knew of. Plus his devoted assistant of 20 years is leaving him during all of this to get married when he really needs her the most because he is going bankrupt. A truly caring assistant would hang in there a while longer to help get him through it. Not a lot of forethought went into the time lines. Also, I have never in my life seen so many sentences begin with ""and"" or ""but"". Ms. Steel's English teacher must be mortified. The only way I will ready another one of her books is if I get it free again."
3,Not too bad,This one is not a bad story. I enjoyed it. I think you really need to be a d.s. fan though to appreciate it.
5,The Cottage,"This is one of Danielle Steel's best books. It is about Cooper Winslow, a fading movie actor and lady's man who is in financial trouble. She develops the character of ""Coop"" well so it is easy to visualize him.Coop decides to rent out his ""cottage"" guest wings for $10,000 a month to two different tenants. The story centers around his new tenants, their romances, activities and children. In the end, Coop learns valuable lessons about sacrifice, giving to others and true love.A interesting story with a good message!"
1,Reading the back of a cereal box may be more fun.,"If reading the back of a cereal box isn't more fun, at least it's more filling... If your lips move when you read and you lick your finger before turning pages, this is the book for you."
3,A Quick Read,Danielle Steel's novel was out of her ordinary in that the main characters were men. It was hard for me to believe that a young beautiful doctor could possibly find a seventy year old self centered has been actor attractive. The plot did carry you along to a desireable ending. Not one of her worst but there have been better. I did enjoy the characters.
1,Having a bad day DS?,"I Love DS... But The Cottage was, to say the least, horrible. I got tired of reading the same sentences 20 times over in different places in the book. We all knew Alex was in Love in with Jimmy when she first met him!! I felt DS should have gotten into more detail with the romances between Mark & Taryn, and Alex & Jimmy. The ending of the book was rushed with a ""this happened to him & her and this happened to him & her"" like DS had to run to the bathroom and end the book real quick!!!! I was very annoyed with the book when i finished reading it especially for the price I paid to read it!! Sorry DS, two thumbs down for this one."
2,the cottage,"I thought this book could have better. It was a good book but, I thought that some of the events that happend were a bit too much. It is a bit unreal for a man whose wife just died to fall desperatly in love with in less than a year. The whole child thing was not my favorite section of the book. Yes, I understand that a child and a parent may have a bond, but when you have not seen this child in over 20 years you can not be close right of the bat. This book could have been better."
2,What was this story about?,"The problem in this book, for me, was the way that the characters were underdeveloped campy cariacatures of the role they were supposed to play. There was nothing very interesting about the plot, which wandered across the years without direction and tried to build itself by adding in characters till the end. No build up no climax, it was just a journal that chronicled happenings that were dull. In fact the explosive version of a tale of aging Hollywood stars is told by author Thorne Peters in the novel OLDE HOLLYWOOD, which sizzles and sparks where this tale fizzles and treads water. This is the first time of been disappointed by one of her novels, so I will continue to read her work."
1,Bad Brass!,"And I mean BAD! This cd ^%$*S! It's no wonder there are so many copies available. 33 currently. Do Not! buy into the other reviewers comments. If you want brass go to the 2 ecm recordings of Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy ""Avant-Pop' and 'I Only Have Eyes for You'. Some of the best jazz brass out there. And for De Johnette and Surman, I would recommend 'The Advantures of Simon Simon'. Corny title but GREAT disc! -james wood"
2,iMac for Dummies quick reference,"I have a new iMac. However, this book is for older Macs. It does have some useful information though."
2,iMac for Dummies Quick Reference,"This quick reference was recommended with my purchase of iMac for Dummies operating system 10. Unfortunately it is a reference for system 9 and Appleworks, which is not included in the new iMac. I felt it should have not been recommended by Amazon as it is outdated."
5,All Wrapped Up,My christmas gift list is all wrapped up and ready to go thanks to this delightful book of patterns! Lots of variety for all the tastes and ages on my list as well as the interest of this knitter. Good directions and illustrations of techniques used for the less confident knitter. Good descriptions of yarn types for easy substitution for yarns used in the pictured scarves.
2,Disappointed,I quite disappointed in this book. There is only 2-3 patterns which I like from the book.
1,Doesn't Do the Job,"I have been doing biofeedback for many years. This is not a true biofeedback device. Biofeedback is using a device to discover what you feel in your body when, in the case of a temperature device, you see the temperature change on the device. This device is not sensitive enough to do that. Also, this device comes with NO relevant instructions. Don't waste your money."
4,Good rice cooker,"Cooks ok, it tips a little when you force the spatula at the bottom to get any remaining rice, but overall, it is a good rice cooker"
1,WATSE OF TIME & MONEY,"I bought this 2 months back.i was never satisfied with this-Rice cooker overboils the water and leaves countertops messy(With out adding extra water !! I tried different grains with different measurement of water ) still messy!!-Rice sticks in the bottom of the pot every time you cook rice ( No matter if you let it stand in the pot for at least 10 to 15 minutes (after the cook button change to warm button) before taking rice out of the pot)or ( when the cooker is not left on ""warming"" for prolong period.) It still sticks!!-Its too hard to clean(we need to soak it for at least 5 min and scrub it for 5 min)-Takes too long to cook(compared to other rice cookers it takes around 20-30 min)- It doesn't even come with a spoon ,not good looking..and what else ..nothing good about it.WASTE OF MONEY"
2,Disappointed in this rice maker,I previously purchased the 3.3 cup version (Panasonic SR-G06FG 3.3 Cup) from amazon in 2010 and it has been fantastic. It never sticks and cleans up with just a wipe. i more recently purchased this 5.5 cup model as a gift for my son and daughter-in-law thinking they would be equally satisfied. NOT SO MUCH!!!!! The rice sticks every time and it is a nuisance to clean. I recommend steering clear of this item.
2,Does NOT come with Steamer Basket,"I wanted both a rice cooker and a steamer. The Panasonic website shows that this unit comes with a steamer tray. Nope, and they don't make one. I was told to use a ""standard"" steamer. I guess one of those three legged expandable ones. There is no auto-warming when doing this, so you just have to ""monitor"" your veggies while they steam. I wanted a basket that sat on top of the rice so that you could cook both at the same time.Now I have to pack it and ship it back."
5,Boils perfect rice for 30 dollars,"Great rice cooker, and my first. Be sure to rinse your rice well or it boils over. Not that big a deal, you can also try to add a small drop of olive oil to coat the top of the water and that usually prevents boilover (I learned that cooking pasta)As far as the lack of steamer being a negative, I bought this in China Town and saw that the version of this exact rice cooker with a steamer basket and scoop cost 76 dollars. No thanks.I don't see why people are complaining about the lack of steamer...it's cheap plastic garbage as well as the scoop.If you want a steamer, I'd invest in a nice cookware set that has a steamer insert for the stock pot. Or just, buy a steamer insert for your stock pot. I wouldn't want to steam anything in a rice cooker anyway.I'd rather it do one thing well and cost little than several things poorly and be expensive."
2,Affordable rice cooker,Cheap cooker by which you can cook any rice. If you are looking to buy for a family you need to go for a better one.
1,A Rice Cooker / Steamer that doesn't steam?,"FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. This item is advertised as a cooker and steamer but doesn't come with any function to steam natively? This is a BBB complaint waiting to happen, and because I ordered 3 days before the November Xmas shopping window I'm SoL??? Unbelievable Amazon and Panasonic, what a team, can't hit!"
2,Too small and too sticky!,"The product is smaller than I thought and it is also quite sticky. After use, I have to soak it in water for hours before cleaning it."
1,Rice sticks,The pan doesn't have a non-stick coating so the rice sticks (go figure). Not a bad brand from what I hear - I just prefer a cooker with a non stick coating.
2,not worth for the money paid,This is not a non-stick. When I cook rice it sticks to vessel. becoming difficult for cleaning.
4,Good rice cooker,"I have been using this rice cooker for a couple of months now and it works fine. I wanted one without a non-stick coating to replace my old Panasonic which was too small and had the Teflon coating which was peeling off. It is easy to clean up if you soak it for a few minutes. At first I was getting very soggy rice as I was following the instructions incorrectly - you should add the rice to the pan and THEN add the water as it says, not the other way round. Doh! And soak the rice in the pot before turning it on. Simple. I don't bother washing the rice first. It does tend to bubble at the top even with just 2 cups of rice, but not that bad. Always let stand for about 10 minutes after cooking to avoid sticking. All in all I am very happy with it."
2,"Great item, but it went up in smoke!","We need to see if Amazon stands behind these products, this one went up in smoke when it was plugged in, so I can't say if it is any good."
5,Good quality. Good for 4 people.,It's just the good size for my family of four people. It's running well so far...
3,Decent but not the best,"The cooker serves its purpose - it cooks rice well. I've had good results for different measurements. The only drawback is that the cooker did not come with its own spoon or spatula, something I have received with other cookers. And the description says steamer, but it doesn't come with a steaming basket.Also, the rice sticks to the bottom which becomes a pain to cleanup. It does a decent job, but I wish I had paid less for it."
4,Panasonic Rice cooker,"Very good product. It works fine. Cooks rice fast. Only draw back is rice sticks at bottom, but if you put little oil at the base and then keep rice , its fine. Good to cook for 3-4 people."
1,Messy cooker,"I say this is very small cooker. It cannot even cook 2 cups of rice peacefully, it is spilling water around during cooking. Still I rate it better than Aroma cookers, which have the problem of lot of rice sticking at the bottom. I suggest ppl to go for 10 cup Panasonic cooker (which is available for the same price as this cooker from Walmart!)."
2,Did not work for me,"My windows 7 computer is not able to run this as the screen color is way off. So, do not buy it for a new computer to play."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased one of these. The folding mechanism bent badly the first time I tried to fold it. It is very heavy. The attachment mechanism requires that you slip a washer in between the attachment forks and the sleeve for the bolt. It is very awkward and time consuming. The welds are rough. You should either buy the cheapest thing you can find - it can't be any worse than this , or spend more money and get one that is better designed and better built."
3,nice thing for a huge dudes,"hi folks,be carefull , it will come in a huge non-udjustable size. and all this gold thing its a rubbish i mean you barely can see that gold boltsgood luck!"
1,Less than 1/3 of book is actually about the battle.,"This glowing account of the Wermacht glorifies their campaign. No mention of the atrocities commited by the Germans is made. Russians are all portrayed as either lucky or fanatical, Germans are all brave and competent. There are no descriptions of tactics within the city and there is only a small chapter after the encirclement.There is some photos at the back that could be straight out of Goebbels. These are complete with fake inscriptions such as ""We'll do it this way, you to the right, you to the left"" showing german soldiers in very ""soldierly"" poses.Hitler would have been proud.For a much better account read ""Enemy At The Gates"".Eduard Kagan"
5,Fine book of a disasterous battle...,"When you think of Stalingrad, look at your society today. Who won? The good sheep, or the bad sheep?"
1,A very old book under a new title,"This is an old book under a new title. The author took the section on Stalingrad from his old book, published in the sixties under the title ""Hitler moves East"", and added a couple of new paragraphs. I have both books, which are identical, and I consider this book an attempt to sell the old stuff under a new title."
3,Good and a graphic detailed account of Case Blue,Title misleading and footnotes missing but an enjoyable reading. The author has a good storytelling ability but lacks any style of historical worksmanship.
4,Bali Houses,"This a book of beautiful photographs taken of houses in Bali.I enjoyed the architecture and the gardens.I also highly recommend Tropical Style, which encompasseshouses in different locales of Southeast Asia."
3,There is some thing missing.,"Over all I thought this book was very good.The one thing that disapointed me was not enough information on Winona her self.I mean by this her likes and dislikes and also the things she likes to do in her spare time when she is not so caught up in her career.This book does have plenty of in depth detail on her acting career and plenty of detail on her 60ish parents.maybe I just want to see Winona write her own biography,something similar to Frank McCourts Angelas Ashes.So for now this book is the best out there until Winona gives her authorization to someone to write that book with the in depth detail for which I would like to read."
5,"One fantastic actress, one fantastic book!","If your a die-hard Winona Ryder fan, this book is a must have!"
3,Where's the Beef?,"We Want Our Little Red Book Back! This book seems like a poor replacement for Bill James' / Stats Inc.s Major League Handbook, for us stat geeks. However it does offer much of the same information, so it's not a complete waste of money. I've kept all of my little red books, as they offer great insight and you can easily track annual changes. I'll reluctantly use this as well.If you are only intersted in current Baseball Fantasy information, I'd suggest that you spend the money for this book at TSN's Fantasy site. That has been my on line bible for the past three years, and I've got a number of wins to show for it."
3,Ok to go,Initially the cooker was good but as the days goes the water came out of the cooker when cooking. This keeps continue but the there wasnt any problem in cooking. Apart from this it is good to go.
1,completely unsatisfactory,"This rice cooker is a piece of junk. We bought it to cook rice for two people and for use as a steamer. First of all it browns the rice on the bottom of the vessel and even if I try and anticipate when it's about to finish and stir the rice then the rice on the bottom gets brown and sticks together. I have followed the directions slavishly and tried it with reg.white rice, brown rice and uncle ben's rice and the rice on the bottom gets brown with all three. Secondly despite the title the device is not usable as a steamer and doesn't come with a basket."
4,Working good,Cooks rice well as another cooker.Best part is cleaning the vessel is very easy as the rice does not stick to the surface.Cheap as well.
5,So far so good,"I don't have any complaints about this rice cooker. I've had it 3 months now. It is nice it has a keep warm function. And I like the slot to stick the rice scoop. The bottom of my rice is brown sometimes, but it depends on how exact I measure the water. It is also very easy to clean. I have not used the steamer insert so can not comment on it."
4,Fast cooking electric rice cooker,"Great electric rice cooker. Cooks fast. However if around, I recommend to pull the power chord as the keep warm mode (it goes to when done) has a notch higher temperature. This higher temp flakes the bottom portion of the cooked rice thus making it a little crusty to eat."
3,"Too big for couples, better for a family","This rice cooker does the job. However I find it too big if you're cooking for one or two people - the minimum suggested amount of rice is 4 uncooked cups - that's a LOT of rice. I just ignore the minimum and go with 2 cups anyway, but it can overcook the rice and you end up getting more of a crust at the bottom. I personally should have bought a more compact unit. The non-stick surface is good."
3,Tips For Vintage Style by Cath Kidston,"Although the pictures and ideas in the book are inspiring, I was disappointed to find out that it was so small. It only measures about 4"" X 6"", which also makes it kind of hard to look at. I wish I would have read the details of book's description. I would have never paid that much for such a tiny book."
3,dinosaurs are love,"My heart couldn't pass up these cute dinosaur sprinkles!!! however if you're just wanting to buy the sprinkles, plan on paying three times their cost for shipping. Check ... the big auction site for better deals on these."
4,Good product with a little tweaking,"Nice build. I found the targets to not operate smoothly right out of the box. The burs left from rough manufacturing would cause the targets to bind. After smoothing rough edges as other reviewers have recommended, it works great. Just move target back and forth in tree and you will see the contact points. Used a metal file to round contact point on targets and soften hard edges on the holders. Took me about 15-20mins. Drilled holes in legs and secured in ground with tent stakes. Didn't know if that was necessary, but it definitely was secure with stakes.I also had a new DoItAll target set with me and it failed on first outing. Lost a roll pin making one of the targets nonfunctional. Not sure that was the best design considering the impact during use.Happy with this Champion product."
1,Should not have to finish product just to get it to work,"I hoped others were overstating the issues with this product. No overstatement here. The stick faces didn't last to the first shot. The target DO NOT MOVE EASILY SIDE TO SIDE. This is boasted in the ad. This is false advertisement. I am still working on my tree to try to get it to work side to side. I have filed and shaped, but still having a hard time. I'm not one to return items, but if I don't get it working soon I'll have no choice. Save your money and buy a quality product. I have no idea what that is, but I can assure you it's NOT a champion product. Buyer beware that you are buying an inferior product that you will spend a lot of item trying to get it to work before you ever get to play with it if at all. You have now be duly informed."
5,"A great guide to bad advice, corruption and scandals","After the 1929 crash a book was published of all the outrageous forecasts in the years before. Bull! has the same idea except that it adds photos and graphs. I'm not sure which is more shocking... the quotes or the aftermaths. Bookviews: ""There is no comfort in having lost your shirt in the stock market these passed few years, but there are lots of laughs and cautionary wisdom in Bull!"" Loved it!"
1,DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY WASTE OF TIME,DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS BOOK. IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR TIME. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY
3,Author's Opinion to be Listed in the Next Addition of Bull!!,"In a book about poor recommendations, I find it hilarious that the authors give their own market opinion, which has proven to be incorrect.Page 119, in reference to Abby Joseph Cohen's S&P 500 forecasts:""Last we heard she was still calling for a twelve-month of 1,150. From 835, that's a pretty heady reacceleration.""Last I heard, the S&P was at 1.110. That's up 36% in 9 months, 3 months left in the twelve-month forecast. Hopefully, no one was listening to the author's opinion in early 2003."
4,Healing Oursleves,"Great book, very easy to understand. Great information on natural healing and causes. Everyone should have a copy in their home. Good condition for a used book"
2,Not For Everyone,"Based on reviews I've read I was eager to buy this book. However, I could not embrace or accept much of what I read when I initially flipped through it. For example, I find it hard to believe the shape of a person's facial features indicate various levels of health.Although I tried to keep an open mind, I could not finish reading this book and ended up giving it to a library book sale. Hopefully it will benefit someone else."
3,deceiving colors...............great shoes though,"you have to love these shoes regardless of their colors.they are comfortable, easy to wear and goes casual or for going out.i ordered the black snake print which is called gold snake. the pictures shows a more demure t-strap flat, more black than gold. however, in reality, there is more gold and more gold than black.if you are into that flashy 80's gold sparkle, this is it for you. if you wanted to wear slim black pants or jeans, these shoes are bit too much.just be warned....."
1,Dora the abonoxious,"I'm fairly new to the Dora scene as we didn't have cable when my oldest was a preschooler, but was apalled today to hear Dora and Boots singing a song teaching my child wicken!! I can live with witches on the show and pretend play of fairytale lands, but to actually promote something like that is just wrong. Unless Dora is going to start singing ""Jesus Loves Me"" and maybe something Jewish, I think she needs to leave out the wicken! I TOTALLY agree with the other mom who was so upset about finding this in a children's show. She probably misspelled things because she was so upset. If you all are so concerned about it being such a wonderful teaching tool, then you are paying very close attention to what it's really teaching! My daughter that didn't have Dora learned Spanish just fine from Big Bird and Rosetta and that's where we'll stay!"
3,dora the explorer-saves,TWO separate 20 minute shows(the island one has been on T>V>numberous times--are on this type!!!! THIS IS NOT LISTED ON THE PREVIEW~~IT DEFINATELY SHOULD BE!!!!the new section is ONLY 20 minutes long --cute-typical Dora style song- going over crocadile lake- thru the forest to get to castle-new charaters-- the witch (will not scare )and the prince(a cute little guy) are the exciting part and does hold the interest of my 2 year and 3 1/2 year old--personally for the price of the ++++20 minutes++++for that is all that is new~~~~ I would have waited for it to be on t.v.
1,DORA SAVES THE PRINCE,"I AM A CHRISTIAN MOTHER, AND I DO NOT THINK DORA (WHO HAS BEEN SO HOLESOME), SHOULD BE PRACTICING WITCH CRAFT. MY DAUGHTER LOVES DORA BUT WHEN I SEE IT HAS THIS CONTENT IN IT I WILL NOT LET HER VEIW IT. THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE WHO I AM SURE WILL AGREE. DORA CAME OUT AND I WENT AND BOUGHT ALL THE VIDEOS YOU HAD. BECAUSE SHE LOVES HER! BUT IF DORA CONTINUES TO PRACTICE THIS IN OTHER VIDEOS I WILL NOT BUY OR LET HER WATCH THEM. JUST FOR ONCE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CHILDRENS PROGRAM THAT THESE CONTENTS WERE NOT IN THEM. I AM SURE YOUR WRITERS CAN COME UP WITH DIFFERENT STORY LINES THEN WITCHCRAFT!HOCCUS POCUS NONSENCE! I AM A VERY CONCERNED MOTHER AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS. PLEASE REMEMBER, NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO SUCH HORRIFIC MOVIES. THE WORLD WOULD BE ALOT BETTER OFF WITH OUT ALL OF THIS NONSENCE. SIGNED A VERY UPSET AND CONCERNED PARENT."
3,Average Rating,"The book is okay, but it seems old fashioned. You can still learn something from these all of these books."
3,AN ITALIAN SLICE OF LIFE,This is a slice of very real life in current Italian society. Although the credit disaster isn't particularly mentioned the circumstances within the plot certainly bring that to mind. Nothing high minded but a good slice of life.
3,cloudy days,"Most of the days in this domestic drama are cloudy indeed. Elsa has just finished her art history degree as her mid-life project. Her husband Michele threw her a party, then afterwards broke the news that, in fact, he hadn't worked in two months because he was fired. All the feathers hit the fan. They must sell their house and boat, take jobs far beneath their station in life, battle emotions of fear and (for Michele) self-hatred, negotiate issues of friends and family, and decide whether to choose fight or flight. Days and Clouds won fifteen awards in the Italian equivalent of the Oscars, but I thought it dragged along rather predictably for too long (115 minutes) and then concluded rather blandly. Still, even though the story is cliched, it's certainly not a cliche for people who experience what they do, and in this sense the film delivers deep emotions. In Italian with English sub-titles."
5,Are you really who you think you are?,"How closely is your job tied in with your very identity? Anyone who feels secure and deserving in their comfortable middle class lifestyle is bound to come unhinged when watching this powerful film...What happens when you lose your prestigious position and privileges and suddenly find yourself working class ? How much do our jobs and homes define who we are? If you lose that job, do you also lose your self-worth? Can you redefine yourself as working class, living where you never would have deigned to live before? Can you keep the same friends now that you can no longer afford to eat in the same restaurants?In the current crisis, this film should resonate with everyone... How many of us are really secure, no matter what we do as professions? The acting is superb, the plot tight, and the characters resonate, as do the situations..."
2,Mostly cloudy,"The cinematography is lovely. Other than that, this is a one tone film. Man loses his job and he and his wife have to do some serious downsizing. It goes from bad to worse. It is not a lot of fun to watch. I kept expecting something to happen to change the mood a bit, but it was one, long, monotonous trip down misery lane. There is one brief scene at the end which attempts to put a positive spin on the story, but it's much too little, too late. The director has a wonderful visual sensibility but has no sense of what makes a good drama. Watch it if you want to be depressed."
4,solid film but pretty somber tone,lacks the bit of humor the viewer needs to get through it. prefered The Grocer's Son or Ginger and Cinnamon if you like Film Movement stuff that's similar.
2,Raving Rabbids does not get a Raving Review,This game is silly and did not keep the interest of my 5year old daughter or myself. The graphics are poor and I would not recommend to anyone. Save your money for something else.
3,Cute collection of mini games,The game play is a fairly linear collection of sometimes repetitive mini games. It's cute and entertaining. The game pad controller support is not that great. It's hard to play with the X-box 360 controller and the game play i9s definitely hard on the controllers joysticks. I much prefer the older console Rayman games over this one.
4,For Hard-Core Rogue-sters Only,"If you're a hard core fan of the Rogue Warrior series, you'll enjoy this book. Otherwise, save your money. There are some good insights on team-building. Also, you get a good look at the real-life people on whom many of the Rogue Warrior ""fictional"" characters were based. (I was sorry though not to see profiled the real-life Pinky Da Turd). Much consists of the former Team members singing the praises of The Rogue Warrior himself, what a great and fearless leader he was/in, etc. I am a big fan of the Rogue Warrior series, so I enjoyed the book, but others who are lukewarm or who are interested in corporate team-building might look elsewhere for more steak, less sizzle."
1,Where's ma goods??,Haven't received my order yet- it's a couple of weeks overdue. I hope it's just because of the Christmas rush.
1,"Sorry, Dick, it's Doom on the Reader time...","I have read every book in the Rogue Warrior series, and am disappointed in this one, to say the least. Looks to me like Dickie took the easy way out on this one. The number of team members profiled here is noticeably minimal, and the choices are odd, with some more unfamiliar names present while expected names are glaringly absent. The stories lack depth and detail and who cares how many brothers and sisters the guys had? Even the writing is bigger to fill more pages with this fluff. If you're going to delegate the writing, train the writers, Dear Rogue!"
4,The Men Behind the Stories,This is the book Marcinko fans have waited for. I was impressed by all of the men's stories. Especially enjoyed Steve Hartman's(Stevie Wonder) own tales of adventure and anecdotes. A must have for the Rogue Warrior's hardcore fans!
2,disappoints,"I like reading about Marcinko's exploits, both real and made up (really love the first book though), so I grabbed this book thinking that maybe I'd like it more than his fiction, since I prefer his nonfiction. But it is a disappointing collection, very little written by the man himself and mostly written by the men he writes about. Stick with the main book."
4,"It's ""O.K.""",Richard Marcinko is the supreme ruler of SpecWar and the supreme commando of SpecWar books. I recommend this book to all his fans but it does not have his usual cursing and fighting fits that all his other books have. This is Jim with another review.
3,Looking for the Real Shania,"My thoughts are somewhere in between those of Phil Jenkins and Amanda Richards: For someone expecting the Shania Twain we know, this was a bust. Apart from a couple of good songs - amongst those written by Shania and Paul Sabu - the rest, especially the covers, were mostly dreadful. The sole exception amongst the covers is the dance mix of ""For The Love Of Him"".Perhaps this (and ""Beginnings,"" which is essentially five eighths of the same album) should rather be punted as ""Demo tapes of Teenage Hopeful Eilleen Edwards Twain"".Second look: The songs on this album grow on you once you get over expecting ""current"" Shania. I really like it now."
1,Can I get my money back,"This is at best a rip-off of the tremendous talent we have come to know as Shinia Twain, COUNTRY singer.This music may have done well and good in it's time, but Shinia is a bonafide Country Queen now and for anyone to use her name and status to capitalize on anything but the country music star we have all come to know and love is a rip-off.Yes, this album is a rip-off as is. Were it presented as Shinia (Eileen), circa 1990, ""Disco queen"" It would have been a fairer description of this music then what it was.Can I get my money back?3of4El centro, CA."
1,Disapointed,"I am really disapointed that this CD turned out to be ""Hard Rock""? I guess I thought a Shania CD would be country. If I would have wanted a hard rock album, I would have ordered same. Thanks"
5,Here's Your Hobby Slot Car Racing,"Five stars.This book is a blast from the past of 1966 slot car culture.For those who lived the culture it is a pleasant reminder of the past, and for those modern racers it shows the heritage of the hobby. The book is from a series on hobbies that was a mainstay of school and library stocks. There are great photos of commercial tracks and vintage slot cars. Highly recommended."
4,It's still fun,"I started playing lineage 2 back when it was in open beta, I got adicted and havent stoped yet. The graphics are awesome and with a decent video card (Raedeon 8500+ or equiv) it feels like your really there. Theres tons of lore and backstory to play off of if you like to role play.The only real downside is monthly cost, but to me this game is worth it.A+"
4,"You are, or you arent.","You are either a fan of MMORPG's or you're not, it's plain and simple. Lineage 2 IS a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. Kills monsters, gain exp, gain levels, gain items. (PlayerKilling is also a part of most mmorpgs, so be prepared to die a bit)Never judge a game from it's Beta Test, take shadowbane for an example, the beta test was great! But when the game released.. well, it sucked!Wait a while before deciding on this one, it's not done yet, and the newbies are giving bad reviews."
5,This game is a blast,"I had a ton of fun with this game during open beta and can't wait to get back to playing it. Not your typical fantasy RPG - it's got wide open, player on player combat where anything goes. There's a karma system to penalize PKers, but so what? I love prowling the hillsides looking for newbies, and facing mercenaries looking for me afterward. Way too much fun!"
3,PRICE of the game,"Ok whats the damage going to be to my wallut to place this game?? If you dont get what im talking about there are lots of others that do. IM talking about the online cost ... the online cost is what troubles me. so someone tell me what the cost is going to run, better be free."
2,Pretty doesn't mean good...,"I played the game in open beta also, and I must say I found it very boring, the fact that the graphics are amazing doesn't meant the game is too. It was a good time killer, but that's about it. You plat it because there's nothing else to do. This game isn't worth it, (...)."
2,Service leaves something to be really desired...,"The game, content or graphics and players are great! It's the support you get from NCSoft... very poor!You can't login... servers are crashing since the patches. No communication from NCSoft about the issues.I won't play or buy another NCSoft game."
4,I love it so far,"I've been playing the closed beta now for 3 weeks. If you like Everquest, I think you will like this game too. The graphics blow everything else out of the water. The female characters are very scantily clad ... !!! ... but that does just add to the fun. I happen to like the pvp aspect of the game. I wasn't a PKer but it did make the game more intense. You had to be stealthy when you were hunting and watch out for raiding PK hunting parties. I literally only saw a few minor bugs in the beta but it is lacking in some niceties that most mmorpgs have such as being able to easily find your friends (no /who command) and no autorun. There is a nice economic system which was easy to use, banking, and players can autosell while afk as in Final Fantasy XI. The classes look fantastic. Even the orcs look good. I do wish there was more variety in facial features and hair color. Maybe this will be added after beta. Give it a try if you like this genre. Its a fun game."
3,Has potential,"Played this game for 3 weeks solid and got to level 22. Like most MMORPGs, it is typical... Kill monsters, get xp, level up, rinse repeat.The reason I quit was because of all the Korean bots (unmanned macro players) that farm adena (their money) and sell it on ebay. Furthermore, there is a lack of respect for anyone who isn't an american and thus a lot of racial animosity.Was fun while it lasted but far from being the game to invest time into building a character."
2,Missing the mark....,Here is a brief synopsis of the game:- PK'ing- Koreans with farming bots selling currency on Ebay
3,"Good Game, Rough Start","Had I written this review in my first week of playing, I would have given it 1 star. It is very tough to start out and get going. However, after you hit level 20 (took me 26 hours of play to get to 20) the game really picks up. You can't judge an MMORPG by the first 20 hours of play. So if you think you are interested in this game, be ready for the time to get to level 20. As for the Graphics, they are stunning if you have a machine that can run them properly. if you don't have a P4 2.0 Ghz or better with at least a 32MB video card then don't waste your time. I run it on my P4 2.4 GHz with the Nvidia Geforce 4 MX440 and it runs okay. My Brother runs it on his 3.2 ghz with 128mb video card and it is beautiful. Overall I really enjoy this game, I just rated it lower because of how boring the startup is."
4,1 week of my life has flashed before my eyes,"Upsides:Beautiful graphics makes other MMOGs look like they came from your NES.Addictive gameplay, keep the shades open otherwise you wont realise youve lost a day.Huge world to explore, beautiful valleys, frozen waterfalls, sunsets.Steep treadmill will lead to rewarding characters for those who can handle it.Downsides:While a steep treadmill makes those levels feel rewarding (you have to earn them their not given!), it can also be frustrating.Party adventuring hampers questing and experience gain, best to solo until necessary to party."
1,The PvP part of the game is terrible and ruins the game.,"If you Deffend yourself against someone trying to kill you then that person recives no PvP penalty. HuH ? Does that any sence ? Well if you sit there and let them beat you to death, then and only then are they flagged as a PKer and turn red.The Problem is there is a way to beat the system so that you don't turn red. Simply Disconnect Right after Killing anyone and you will not be flagged as a killer.Or when you first Log on and are murdered Endlessly by some player who is 30 levels higher than you camping the New Player Starting area. Oh thats Lots of Fun for new players let me tell you !Its Exploits like this that make the game less than what it could be.Its a Korean made Game. They have servers in Korea where only Koreans can play. But the North American Servers are for EVERYONE ELSE !!! So chances are unless you speak Chinese your going to be rather lonely sence a large portion of the population comes from there."
1,Horrible,"This game is not great. Hardly any customization, two classes to begin with. Final Fantasy XI made this same mistake. Nobody wants to have to wait that long to get more classes. The interface is absolutely abysmal. Walking is a chore, and you'll be doing a lot of it. The camera is pathetic at best, non-existant at worst. Seriously. Do not play this game."
2,I don't know what you are talking about!,"When I firsted started playing this game I hated it, playing solo was hard. Some people are out there just to ruin your day. Once you join a clan and make some friends within the world of Aden, you'll start to enjoy it.I've been playing for 2 years now and I have a lvl 75 Elf! That's the lvl cap, so I'm pretty happy with that. ^^"
5,love it,"i bought this can opener a couple months ago, and absolutely love it!!love the way it locks and unlocksand it's a quick easy open everytime!!!"
4,1st dvd is HOT- 2nd dvd is NOT,I definetly recommend this for the first dvd. It has several really hot college girls flashing that make it worth the money. The second dvd is AWFUL. Nothing but chubby women flashing at mardi gras. I guess I did see one kinda hot girl in the second dvd but believe me that was it and lasted for 3 seconds.
4,"Recommendable, mostly for Volume 1","I bought this DVD basically because it contains two volumes. That way, if one sucks, the other might be pretty good. The first volume is well worth it. It not only has the usual topless flashing, but one girl/girl scene where they're in a dormroom engaging in some nice foreplay and an extended shower scene which makes you feel like you're right there with her, since she looks into the camera and blows kisses and all that neat stuff. The second volume has pretty much what you can expect. I just wish the GGW series could exercise truth in advertising. It's labeled as Sexy Sorority Sweethearts, so I was hoping to see some sexy dormroom scenes with girls in sororities, including some sexy initiations they might be required to do. But other than those two scenes in Volume One that I mentioned, it's mostly Mardi Gras footage. And I'm sure not all the girls in this edition are from sororities. But altogehter it's a pretty cool DVD."
3,Mildly Entertaining,Maybe we've all become numb after seeing so many of these girls gone wild videos. It just doesn't have the same guilty pleasure flavor it had before. The voyeur element is still there which is cool. In my opinon America's Wildest Bachelor Parties and World's Wildest College Parties blows this one away.
3,There are better Girls Gone Wild DVD's.,"This Girls Gone Wild dvd is pretty disappointing. It definately shows that it is an older one- not very ""action packed"". I would describe it as somewhat boring."
2,College Girls Exposed #2 / Sexy Sorority Sweethearts #2,"The Disc I got has ""College Girls Exposed #2' and ""Sexy Sorority Sweethearts#2"" on it.For me, both were bad news.Both consist entirely of New Orleans Mardi Gras flashing boobs for beads. Some good lookers and some who could pass for mothers of college girls trying to relive their long past youth. Bad news.There were no interviews or T shirt or shorts exchanges. Just continuous flashing through multiple strands of beads at street level or on balconies.Two hours of that gets damned boring. If you like the continuous high speed Mardi Gras type flashing you'll love these. Other wise if you like variety in your viewing I recommend you give these a wide berth."
3,Breasts abound!!,"It's very simple. Young women roam the streets of New Orleans during Mardi Gras, exposing their breasts to anyone with a camcorder and some beads. What's not to like?"
5,The Eel,"Though Imamura's engaging psychodrama of regret and sexual repression opens on an overheated and violent act, it soon cools to a slow burn, as the friendship between two troubled people blossoms tenuously before taking an unexpected turn. Yakusho, an expert at playing stone-faced, emotionally distant protagonists, is both sympathetic and impossible to fathom. Poising the action between icy restraint and simmering catharsis, Imamura--who indulges himself in a couple of surreal vignettes--makes his ""Eel"" a reflecting pool for modern malaise."
4,News At Eel Heaven,"Stop now if you don't watch subtitled movies. That should get rid of the morons....Now, for the rest of you - rent this! It's too costly to buy now (June 2000), but worth a rent at Blockbuster if you liked Shall We Dance, Tampopo, A Taxing Woman, The Funeral, or any other rare splendid movie from Japan that Beat Takeshi did NOT make and star in....Misa Shimizu plays two roles to the hilt, so to speak, and it represents the evil that men can do.....Otherwise, get a life, and find you own....."
3,Movie or failed tv pilot?,"I had watched this movie on the SyFy channel, so I knew what I was getting. Flat out, I bought it because it stars Joe Flanigan (Stargate Atlantis).This movie is ok, but leaves so much unanswered. It feels like a tv pilot that didn't get picked up, so they aired it as a 2-hour movie. The acting is good, and the story revolves around time/dimension travel (sort of like a Sliders episode...with dino-creatures). Warning - It does get a little gory.Semi-Spoiler: this movie would be much better if it wasn't so open ended. I would have rated it 4 stars if the story had been fully developed (i.e., actual ending) as a straight out 2 hour movie.If you are a Joe Flanigan fan AND Amazon offers this at a bargain price - I say buy it!"
3,Not a big fan of gorey but,I'm a big fan of Joe Flannigan - he's done some great work however this isn't one of his best. Still enjoyed watching.
4,Ferocious Planet: Maneater Review,"Ok, there are some movies that should never have made it to a DVD. This is not one of them. I have seen some very bad movies make it to the stores, so I'll forever question why!! Ferocious Planet is a movie I feel every monster movie lover should see. The creatures in this movie were very well made, and makes you glad they are not real, or are they? I have heard there are parallel universes. Never know! I would like to see the T-Rex from Jurassic Park meet this bad boy monster, it would be worth the pay per view. The acting could have been a little better, but I have seen much worse. You basically knew who was going to get killed, all the whimpy people got it with a few cool dudes. There has to be a sequal to this. At the end, the only survivors were standing at an open door. You just know they did not return to their own demention. All in all, its worth the watching."
1,"If you like low budget, low quality movies then this is for you!","Geez, really? Here is my question. How do people in the business of producing movies make a movie that is so bad? I know this applies to a lot of films but you would think there would be more good movies than bad in the world. But to the point of Ferocious Planet....it's so bad you can't believe it, but keep watching because you know it can't really be this bad so you watch knowing something good is about to happen and the movie is going to become interesting and entertaining....well it doesn't. It's bad from the beginning, the middle.....actually I never made it to the end because I shut it off after 40 minutes. I want my 3.99 back."
1,Not Worth Purchasing,"This movie was from the Sci-Fi Channel, which is the first mistake. The movie is technically poor. I've seen better production quality from old black and white science fiction movies. The acting and story is worse than an amateur production. I would rather spend my money on toilet paper than to purchase this movie. I filed it with the rest of my garbage. It's not even worth the trouble of a review.From someone from a generation that made better movies, even on a low budget, this movie stinks."
3,Bad Choice by Director - Tried to mix philharmonic with decent flick,"A lot of sci-fi flicks are stupid, horrible acting, bad production, bad directing and have poor special effects. But that can be said about a good share of my favorite oldies. Love to break them out every once in a while for the nostalgia. Actually, they were perfect in their days. But films like ""ferocious Planet"" are a different story.The one thing I can't get past is a overbearing background (or foreground in much of this one) of lousey music. It made a reasonably mediocre scifi into an irritating set of orchestrations. I will probably not have an interest to dig this one out again. To bad it didn't have an option for the sound track to remove music.I really hope that new and upcoming film directors will get some sense of if, when, type and intensity of music should be included. When they get to a ""Star Wars"" fame, they can afford to put some degree of overbearing music in but until then - leave it out."
3,Not bad...could have been much much better..,"My hope went into high gear when i saw all the posibilities for this one and then wheni actually saw where they choose to go, and once i saw the first few shots of the monster i knew basically what was the movie gonna offer me....it ain't much.After looking at this movie a second time i have this to say:Monster looks much better farther in the movie than the first shots.First shots feels more like a back projection.They could have used some extra cgi creatures....even small ones....but themovie budget woul'nt let them.Actors/actresses are not that bad...the budget limitation and limited effects probably affected them overhall.Some effects shots were repeated to make sure they got their money's worth, butas a viewer we dont need to see a shot twice.I could go on and on...so bottom line...its watchable but its a bare bonemonster movie that could have been much better."
3,Short lived,"The game is fun...the first time you play it! But after a while it gets too easy because you know all the answers. Sure you could also buy the Dirty Minds II game that's out, but eventually you would know all those answers too. I now just pull it out and read a few of the questions to friends that have never heard of the game, and some of the questions are so easy that it's not too hard to figure out what they are getting at."
4,Great buy,A lot of fun for just 2 people or a small group of people. Only downside is that some of the questions are more difficult while others are really easy. It might be effective if they came up with a system that told the level of difficulty for the questions.
1,Terrible terrible game. Wouldn't take it for $1 and wouldn't give it as a gift.,"Pros:- Some clues are kind of amusing.Cons:- Everything in the box is made of paper.- Quite difficult, unrewarding even if guessed correctly.- Answers are bland, so is the repetitive gameplay.- It costs some money.Honestly, this is one of the worst party/board games I have ever owned. It is hard to get a party engaged in low brow humor with boring gameplay and unrewarding progress.Every card game that costs $4 and up is better than this. This game may be my least favorite game. I would rather play monopoly junior with all of my adult friends."
3,"Fun, but not long lasting","Fun game for a party with couples - but since you write in the books, the game won't last long. We decided to copy the pages in the book and use it that way so we can keep the books longer."
3,Good for bachelorette,Bought this for a bachelorette game. Just basically needed the clues booklet. Could see how this could get old fast...
3,Dirty minds,"This is definitely a dirty mind game. If you don't have a ""dirty mind"" or you're easily offended this game is not for you. I had no idea this game would make you think so dirty, but the answers are all clean!"
1,Maybe it would be funnier if you had been drinking... a lot.,"Picked this up during a recent game-buying binge with my girlfriend. What a waste of time and money! The box says it's for, ""Ages 17 or Older"". I'm thinking it should say, ""For groups of giggling 12-year-olds"", because that's about the only group I can see it being very entertaining for. Maybe if you played it with the girls from the bridge club, the shock value would offer some titillating entertainment; otherwise, it's just lame. Save your money and buy something like Quiddler or Settlers of Catan instead."
3,It's alright,"I think the idea of the game is good it's fun to play, but they should have made a ton of flash cards or something instead of books to write in. You run out of books and then basically you can't play the game anymore. May as well throw it away."
1,Never mind the quality my eye!,"I recently purchased the Never mind the quality... Feel the soul CD. Well let me say that this, live recording doesn't do justice to the vocal effect our musical experience of Linda Jones efforts I wish I knew what I was buying As Titles go think Twice before you purchase this one. I love vintage music and my quest continues for a respectable recording of Linda Jones Greatest Hits to include ""thats when I stop loving you"" Call me the drummer yall"
2,Not what I expected,"My daughter and I are big fans of the TV show, however, this particular video is so BORING! It started good, but just dragged and didn't get better. I did not like the fact that in the 3rd cartoon, they had a pet rabbit in their classroom named ""Wabbit"". Some children really do pronounce ""r"" words with a ""W"" sound, so it doesn't help when you are trying to teach a child how to say something properly when the whole time the TV is saying ""Wabbit"""
1,I'm sending Little Bill to boot camp!,"This is soooo !dumb! A boy that always says ""Hello Friend"". If I hear that one more time my head will explode! I mean let's face it I'm a fan of Bill Cosby but this is not one of my favorites. Better luck next time Bill!"
3,Enjoyed the first two books more,"I really loved and highly recommend the first two books in the Crossroads series, but I did not enjoy this book nearly as much. The characters were very underdeveloped and the plot very stiff compared to the other books. The plot was filled with so many twists and so many new characters were introduced that not enough attention and detail was devoted to any of them. I hope that another Crossroads book will be written and the characters explored in more depth."
5,A right ripping good yarn with fun and intriguing characters,"Having read all three of Nick O'Donohoe's books in the Crossroads series, I can gladly recommend them to all who enjoy strong, well-developed characters and intriguing situations and characters. It should appeal to all fans of fantasy, and to many others as well. One word of caution, though. You should read the books in the order in which they are written, since Nick doesn't back-track in his explanations much. Luckily, all three books are available from Amazon"
3,Pretty Good,"This album was good. Considering this was Bobby's last album with N.E so there had to be distractions surrounding this one. My favorite track is ""A Little Bit of Love"", along with ""Friends, Count Me Out, and Whispers in Bed"". I think this album had problems because Bobby was there on one song but then he wasn't. Even in the video for ""Count Me Out"", Ricky sings a verse, but that's actually Bobby's part and voice, so he could have at least done the video. Around this time he would only show up to about 1/2 of the group's appearances, even on the credits they only name Ronnie, Ricky, Mike and Ralph, but Bobby is on the cover.To sum it up about this album considering the Bobby Brown situation this was a very decent effort."
5,Vertigo is the way to go,"I think this is the best way to throw a lot of colored light (with motion) for the least amount of money. These lights, like most I guess, are fragile and if you bang them around they will quit moving to music and even worse, quit lighting up. I have had some break shortly after I had them and a few last a couple of years. I can only assume that bumping them is what caused them to stop working. Even though they have not lasted forever, I still buy them because I see the value in them. Not sure why they went to an all blue light, I think you can still order the multiple colored, which I think is more festive."
1,Not as good as the American version,"To be blunt: this may simply be a cultural difference. But, the American Showtime version of QAF was truly cutting edge. Most everyone who watched the American version immediately believed that Justin and Brian were (could be) deeply in love. The characters were more richly portrayed - and the producers were honestly willing (able) to make a more adult version: topics and nudity. The British version inspired the American but I never connected with a single character on that show. I found myself hitting fast forward out of boredom. I would highly recommend that everyone watch all 5 seasons of the US version before watching the British series. There has never been a series since that was so honest and willing to talk about the issues - even if many in the community felt that it was over sexualized. The truth is that you can remove sexuality from the gay community."
4,Great,It's a great tv series for being British but the guys are definitely cute.really like the blonde.Of course lead actor is cute as well
1,Sex sex and more sex,"Couldn't get past the first episode--WAY too much sex and lack of morals. I guess if that's your thing, but not mine..."
5,THE ultimate centrosome bible!,"This book is by far the most up to date and comprehensive treatment of centrosomes and centrioles available. Anyone interested in the cytoskeleton or cell biology would do well to get a copy of this book. Chapters are all written by leaders in the field, and provide both an excellent overview of current research as well as an entry point into the extensive primary literature. The book is well organized and tightly focused, a tribute to the fine work of its editor Robert Palazzo. This is destined to be a classic for many years to come!"
5,Mitchell was a Legend,"We are fortunate to possess this book: for in it we find the musings and interpretations of one of the most erudite Anglo-Saxonists on an extremely wide variety of topics. A great book for a beginner, but still very interesting to a specialist. Also good for a teacher looking for ways to make the subject of Old English more interesting and accessible to students."
2,80 blocks from Tiffany's with updates,Most of this topic has already been covered in 80 blocks from Tiffany's the only difference is there's some recent footage of the main characters but anybody who is a Bronx gang aficionado from the early mid and late 70s knows this cast of characters one thing that is very interesting is during these prehip-hop days the gang members looked more like rock and rollers you know like bikers without motorcycles they were flying a lot hippie styles back then to with their and the jean jackets I personally like the West Coast style of dress with the bandannas much better when you can fly cut sleeves or fly blue or red bandannas but just fly your colors and represent respectfully Johnny Irish
1,Defective DVD,"I've ordered this DVD twice before and both times it would not play properly (freezes up, blips in the audio). Both times I contacted Amazon and they told me how to return the DVD. The second time they stopped selling the DVD. When, months later, I saw the DVD was available again, I ordered it, thinking the problem had been corrected. Unfortunately, it has not.The newest DVD has the same problems. I've tried forwarding over the 'freeze' and sometimes it works and again there are 'blips' in the audio, but not enough so you don't know what is being said. The content of the DVD is fine, it's good workout; the problem seems to be the DVD medium itself."
3,5 yr. old boy kinda liked it may grow into it.,This was purchased in an effort to encourage my 5 yr. old son's fine motor skills. He loves watercolor painting.... so I thought using the pencils would follow. It didn't. You have to really press hard with the pencils to get enough color for the water brush to work well. I think in time it will resurface again when he has better hand control.
5,Wonderful Picture Book,A very interesting Picture book with never seen photos of best quality before. Ideal for modellers.
1,Body Back Roller,"I bought this for $9.95 + $5.95 shipping.It arrived on time, but in a box with absolutely no packing material.On the first use, it immediately fell apart.Extremely poor design, The rollers are mounted on a very narrow small diameter dowel (maybe 3/16 inch) made of soft wood. Any pressure & it snaps.Don't buy this product!"
5,sam shoemaker,"This book was published after the death of it's author, Sam Shoemaker.Sam Shoemaker was hailed as a master of the broad field of human relations and was a true minister of man's Saviour, Jesus. This book is attributed to holding some of his most helpful and most timely messages.The Presbyterian Journal credited this book as the type of book which spiritual ministers need to refresh themselves with from time to time.Sam Shoemaker was a graduate of Princeton University. He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Theological Seminary and the STD from Berkeley Divinity School, both in the year 1948. In this book of 26 chapters, Samuel Shoemaker writes an extraordinarily persuasive set of messages to bring vast new dimensions to the Christian Life."
5,a perfect book of know-how on pediatric anesthesia,"As you start to read, you just see that this is a work of clinical experts on pediatric anesthesia. You can easily find the answers of your questions that come into your mind in everyday practice. It's style designed in such a way that you do not miss a step. You will always need it while performing pediatric anesthesia."
5,STIRRING!,"A stirring record of a spiritual ceremony to end a century of mourning. A plain statement of facts without being overtly accusatory, wielding the impact to strike a rich vein of informed guilt and inform the uninformed."
5,Nuclear Vacation,"I've bought everything JA/JS ever recorded and this is my favorite. It's totally pop metal, but not so completely sold-out that the Jefferson needed to be removed. Actually it's Paul Kantner's last album with the group. ""No way out"", ""Laying it on the Line"" were both big hits, and rightly so, and stand up today. However, the best songs on the album are ""Rose goes to yale"" and ""Champion"", seemingly parts 2 and 3 from ""Freedom at Point Zero's"" ""lightnight rose"". Get it, enjoy and shut it. It's the best."
4,A return to form.,"""Nuclear Furniture"" #28 (1984).8th and final album by the Jefferson Starship. Paul Kantner would leave the band after it's release. Saw these guys in concert in '84, they did a great job, everybody wanted to talk with Grace Slick after the show. This album was a little better than ""WOC"". We start off with the rocking' ""Layin' It On The Line"" #66 hot 100 and #38 MSR, and the pop of ""No Way Out"" #23 hot 100, the technoish""Sorry Me, Sorry You"", the electric ""Connection"", the fun ""Rose Goes To Yale"" (a little back story about Jodie Foster at the time). The Grace Slick tune ""Magician"", which would of fit perfectly on her solo album ""Software"". The mid-tempo ""Assassin"", Grace's intense ""Showdown"" and Kantner's uplifting ""Champion"". A nice comeback after the sluggish ""Winds Of Change'. They would come out with a new album in 1985, under the name ""Starship""."
3,"Solid, yet erratic","Grace Slick had been back for a few years when this was released in 1984. One thing about Jefferson Starship is that, due to so many different songwriting inputs, they are consistently inconsistent. Whenever Mickey and Grace did a duet it was a treasure to behold; however, Kantner's songs are like a completely different world. Sometimes it doesn't even sound like the same band. Their strong points were always the lead singing of Mickey, Grace, and Marty along with Craig's soaring lead guitar.For this album the hits were Laying It On The Line and No Way Out. Like other reviewers have noted there are three songs on here related to the Lightning Rose song on the album Freedom At Point Zero. So, what we get here is an album that is part JS that we know and love, and part conceptual work of the story of Lightning Rose. A dis-jointed album, but worthy of three and a half stars *** 1/2"
3,Good product,"I got this because my mother-in-law had one, and I really like hers. I love the convenience of this thing, however, it can also be a pain. The basic premise is to add the ingredients, turn it on, and leave it. However, no matter how closely I follow the directions, the rice will burn to the bottom every time unless I am constantly stirring it. If I wanted to stand there and stir it, I would just cook it on the stovetop. But wait, when I cook it on the stovetop, I don't have to worry about stirring it, because it doesn't burn. I am still giving it 3-stars, but only because I am sure that operator-error has something to do with this problem. When I figure it out, I will come update my review."
2,Not correct fit lid,"I recently purchaged this panasonic 10 cup rice cooker, I received it with not proper size lid. The lid size is little small for that pan so when it's cooking water is spilling all over. I returned it back."
1,Doesn't work with brown rice,"I have tried 4 times to cook brown rice. I feel like Goldilocks; too crunchy, a little crunchy & all mush. When I increased the amount of water, there was a very starchy mess leaking all over my countertop. Not what I expected at all. I haven't tried white rice. Perhaps that will work, but not the reason I purchased this cooker. As soon as I locate the receipt, it is being returned."
2,"Spils water, burns rice in the bottom",was expecting panasonic to be a leading brand in rice cookersbut kinda dissappointed with this product. the glass cover stayson top with gap inbetween so when water boils it get spilt allaround also rice get burned when steaming veggies.convincing factor: cooks rice really quick
1,Terrible!,"Every time I've tried to cook rice in this thing, it boils over several times, makes a huge mess on the counter, and makes poor rice. I've only tried this with standard white rice, but it's always a little crunchy, and the boiling over is ridiculous. I tried every troubleshooting suggestion in the instruction manual, but nothing worked. Now I'm saving up for a Zojirushi."
5,hell yes!,"first of all...i think another reviewer said that this band is kinda like limp bizkit, and i would definitely say that that is not at all true...i would say that they're more like tool/perfect circl...but either way they are really awsome...i saw them live in san diego and they rocked...this cd is really one in a million"
5,Update,"I originally gave this game a four star review--it deserves FIVE! Since purchasing this, I've tried many other games and NONE compare. For it's market, this game is number one! I've owned it now for over a year and still I enjoy it. Only in books have I experienced the ability that this game has in pulling you into the subject. If you purchase this, then you'll see the mastery that the designers injected it with. Happy flights!"
4,this game is good,"Ok if you are new to flight sims like i was get this game as your first flight sim. you will get the hang of it and buy other flight sims. anyway with the game the graphis are great and you can be a german, french, american, or british pilot. This game is a good game but after a while i got tired of it. it gets boring but if you play on the internet it never does. the game sounds are uthentic and it sort of looks like you are really flying. belive me though when i say get this game as your first flight sim."
5,I miss this game's heyday,"This is a GREAT game, and with the Full Canvas Jacket addon it looks even better. But I never really played this for its single player - I absolutely LOVED multiplayer. I only stopped playing this game when it became difficult to find servers with people in them.This game got me into the genre of WWI aviation - I now have tons of books on the subject even. In terms of the game itself, it still remains unmatched, mostly due to the fact that no significant WWI sims have been released since, sadly enough.Overall, very fun and definitely worth purchasing. Be advised that you will need access to mods to make this game with with modern video cards and operating systems. Just run a Google search for mods."
3,Is it my machine or am I doing something wrong?,"Being a fan of the original two RB games, I ordered this game when I got a new PC with Windows ME. Only problem is, I get ""jitter"" everytime I move the joystick up or down. I tried a new joystick, but it didn't fix the problem. Inquiries to Sierra went unanswered. The game is cool when I fly in a straight line, but having to go up or down gives me motion sickness. Anyone else have this problem?"
2,Much less fun than Red Baron,"This is now an old game, but when it first came out I played it and it was much less fun than Red Baron. The graphics which look like they came from Turok the dinosaur hunting game with annoying mist and very unnatural triangles appearing everywhere. It is very difficult to keep an eye on the enemy with the bizarre and sporadic graphics. I would often lose the enemy by confusing them with the Moon which looked bizarre in this game too. The flight models for the aircraft are extremely unpleasant. The controls where spongy and the planes would come apart with little warning.Navigation on the front was difficult and unpleasant too. There was mist and triangles obscuring the ground when you got above a couple hundred feet. I was not able to spot very many useful land marks and there was not auto pilot or navigational cheat to take me to where I need to go to complete my missions.I did not have a good time wallowing through this game."
2,Didn't do it for me,"I wanted to like this game but it just didn't impress me. It is impossible to figure out where the enemy is and how you should attack them. Maybe they should have included a tutorial or something. The graphics were adequate but I just couldn't fly the plane well enough to make the game enjoyable. Put it this way-if it was this hard to fly one of these, I would have died on my first day in the war."
2,Red Baron 3-D,"I purchased this game via Amazon.com after playing Red Baron-2. Installed it and had nothing but problems. My system met the requirements to run it but the Campaign portion of the game refused to work. I contacted Sold Out for tech assistance but they were unable to solve the problem. They requested I return the game so they could check it for flaws. I plan to return the game to them(at my cost)and see what they come up with.I was able to play Red Baron-2,by Sierra, and really liked it. This version is less than I expected and unless the flaws can be addressed, I wont purchase another game via Sold Out."
3,Review of the Beiderbecke Affair,"I was expecting more from this series, but only watched the first episode and found it lacking. I may watch more but it won't be my first priority. I found it plodding.Jo"
1,Watch Out,Over the past six months I have purchased and returned this set five times. Each time the problem has been that the first disc of this three disc set may be labled disc one but is in fact disc three containing episodes 5 & 6. and of course disc three is disc three and also has episodes 5 & 6.
1,Faulty product,"Of the 3 Disk Set,Disk No.1, Pictured and labelled as No.1does not contain Episode 1 and Episode 2as printed on the case and on the Label.It is obviously a manufacturing fault. And as it the replacement also had the same fault, I guess, a whole batch is faulty.All this was explained by me previously but there seems to be no internal communication with your separate departments.Kind regards H GThe Beiderbecke Affair - Series 1 (3 Volume Boxed Set)"
2,Great show (5*); lousy manufacturing (0*),"Be prepared to potentially recieve mis-packaged product as apparently Goldhil shipped more than a few units that had a copy of the 3rd disk mis-labelled as disk 1. Everthing looks normal but the content labeled Disk 1 is another copy of the Disk 3 contents. Thus can't recommend that you get this as a gift for someone -- won't really be ""funny"".Content is great (as stated in other reviews), but it might not be worth the hassel of buying anywhere other then where you can immediately check the contents for this manufacturing flaw."
2,"Content, A; Video quality, D","The content of the show is interesting, but the video quality is terrible, blurry, worse than VCR. The sound is muddy, and it's difficult to understand the dialog, especially for American ears. Another good Britcom destroyed by poor quality transfer."
5,We built a weekend retreat with a minimal budget!,We used this book as a guide and built ourselves a terrific weekend getaway. We would recommend it to almost anyone who had an interest in building and who wanted an inexpensive weekend retreat.
4,Not for armchair builders,"I liked this book alot. Contains simple and practical ideas. But I would say it is best for someone who is ready to get off their duff and build something, anything. Instead of just looking for pretty pictures and dreaming. If I can do it you can too."
3,Good ideas No Photos except Cover,I don't get why you put a beautiful photo on the cover of your book and all 2nd rate hand drawn pictues inside. It's deceptive! Won't help you with Country Home ideas. Maybe good for a kids Fort or a Bowhunting stand...
2,Not what I was looking for,"Book was not what I was looking for. I am building a cabin, not a lean to shelter, so this book was not helpful at all."
3,Nothing spectacular,"This book has children touch the scratchy grill of the fire engine, the hard firefighter's helmet, the rubbery tires, the metal bumper, and the glowing reflectors on the firefighters' coats. My 18 month old son enjoys this book, but I feel the book would be better if it had more unique qualities of a fire engine, like the ladder or the hose. We have several other books that have grills, tires, and bumpers to touch."
3,pricey for what you get,For the pirce of this book it is very small with only a few pages...not worth the $6.99
5,Fire Engine Touch and Feel,My grandson makes me read it to him over and over and over. He loves this book!!
3,For much smaller kids...,"I bought this book for my three year old who LOVES fire trucks. Although he does love it, it is a bit small and seems geared toward age 1-2. It is a very short book, just a few pages, and very small for the price. The size is clearly listed on the page, but I wasn't prepared for how small it actually was. Still a cute and entertaining book my son enjoys looking at the pictures and feeling the front grill of the fire truck."
3,Good Enough,"It was the game that got me addicted to the flight sim set. The graphics were ok, but it made me want the next game even more."
5,cut it,"I Loved it...very heavy duty, and well made...great product at a great price, you cant go wrong with this one.."
1,Ouch,Tugs horribly on the hair to the point where it's shortening my hair by simply ripping it out by the root. Sticking with shears.
1,Big Rip-off! Beware!,"This game is one big RPG Rip-off, you buy the game for $49.99 (plus S&H) and when you get the game on your computer it says that you need a Credit Card or Game Time Subscription Card (which cost $29.99) just to start the game. It only has On-line player game and no single player game that you could play Off-line, so don't buy this game if you have no Credit Card and can't buy the Game Time Subscription Card, if you do however it will cost you a total of $79.98 to $193.39 (thats if you buy the 12 months subscription with a Credit Card)."
1,The Service is the worst in the history of MMORPG,The Gm's treated me with more disrespect then ever... The gameplay was slow and missions were boring and repetitive.. After the way i was treated in this game i never want to play another game from this company again...There is never anything new going on and the servers are mostly laggy and slow... If your bugged your screwed because GM's will take a good 3 hours to get a hold of you...After that if they see any problems with your account theyll freeze you and make sure you cant move... Even if your in the middle of a timed mission...Service terrible if i could give this game negative stars i would...
2,Great Game Diluted,"This was a great game when it first came out. I started playing it in Beta and loved the direction it seemed to be headed. The only major flaw I saw to early game play was that ""Super Groups"" were poorly implemented and of little use. Aside from that it was an awesome game.But somewhere along the line the visions of the developers ran contrary to the legions of fans. The game play became diluted through constant rebalancing and a large number of the games original players were driven away. I have given up playing it. I tried it briefly recently, just to see if maybe my original impulse to leave was rash and jaded, but it just isn't a fun game any more. Very unfortunate."
4,Great game,I have played MMORPGs for 4 years now. Most of that being in everquest. This game is great fun and the best part is you can log in for an hour get a mission done get exp whatever and actually feel like you accomplished something!No tradeskills to worry about just leap over buldings fly around rooftops and fight the crime infested streets of Paragon City with other superheroes. The character creation system is AMAZING. You can literally create any superhero you can possibly think of. Tiny men to giant amazon women its all there have fun!
2,Booted From Mapserver,"I just bought the game today and I have spent two hours trying to play it only to be booted from the mapserver countless times. I've been able to get in about 3-5 minutes of uniterrupted play time and then it freezes and disconnects me. I am praying that they figure out how to fix this issue because the game could be a potentially awesome one . . . goes to show ya, TEST IT BEFORE YOU SELL IT!!!!"
5,Heroic Fun!,"COH is alot of fun. I have 2 lvl50 toons. A Fire Controller and a Enegry Defender. Of the 2 I like the Fire Contoller to best,the controller can hold villians with ""Choke"" or debuff them with ""Smoke"". The Controller can then use ""imps"" to attack the held villians. In team setting the controller can give each team member ""ClearMind"" which reduces enemy ability to hold team members,can also give endurance and health recovery to all teammates,and 1 teammate can have a fortitude (ench def&attack powers of reciever). You can build a secret base and outfit the base with many rooms and gadets. With Issue7 coming soon and expanded upgrade is coming to make the game more challenging. Getting City Of Villians is almost a must when playing COH to get the most out of this game."
5,Outstanding,Instant fun. Wonderful character development. Super well balanced game. Wonderful team dynamics. Wonderful RP experience. Technically top-notch. BUY IT!
3,Fun but very linear,"Great game but it doesn't have much depth. Granted this will be fixed in upcoming expansions but its just not enough to keep me away from World of Warcraft...Defeat bad guys, get xp, level up, get enhancements, rinse, repeat.WoW comes out, this game is gone...."
5,"Great game, but don't buy it now","City of Heroes has been my favorite MMO for years, but today it was announced that the game was shutting down soon so there's no point buying it now."
5,"A ""must play"" for all MMORPG players","City of Heroes is a new twist on MMORPG's. The character creation process is so incredibly near finite that there are no two characters alike in this game. That's especially nice for those who have always dreamed of what they would look like or be like if they were a superhero. Customizing your own hero is what makes this game stand apart from the others. The unique powers given to each character class is a great touch and the pure genius behind the graphics of each power lends to the 5 star rating I give this game. The monthly user fee is minimal compared to other games. I bought a 6 month subscription and ended up with a price of $12.99/mo. HIGHLY recommended, HIGHLY rated."
1,So far...,"If the phrase ""Massively Multiplayer Online"" has ""must subscribe to play at an additional charge,"" hidden somewhere in it, then I'm sure I'll be able to revise my # of stars upward.So, to reiterate what now is at least listed in a *review* somewhere, you have to pay seperately for time on their server(s?).Which it says in tiny print on the box, I see, now that I have it in my hand.Nor will it let me open an account without giving credit card info, despite the fact that it says I get a free month with the purchase of the game.Horrible introduction to this game format."
2,This shouldn't be an online game,"I was over at my friend's house, and he has City of Heroes. Of course I wanted to play it. When i first started I was impressedwith the Character Creation screen, this was one of the best character screens i have seen. After I made my character the troble started. I started to play the tutorial. The tutorial was SOOOOOOOOOO long. I thought it would never end. Finaly when i finished it i started playing in my first city. I play Star Wars Galaxies where I am used to changing professions and gaining skills by crafting ect. There is no crafting in this game I thought, ""wow, then how do people get money to buy items?"", well there ius no items. In fact there is hardly no interaction at all. I thought, ""well then whats the point in making it an online game? Aren't Online games games where people work together to accomplish tasks?"" Well not in this game. I dont recomend this game unless you like to go solo in online games and not work in groups."
1,Worthless support and poor game - DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this game with high expectations. However, after one ""free"" month of service and a total of an hour of gameplay, this is one nightmare that I will not continue to use.I have nothing but technical issues since I bought the game. PlayNC support sent me countless boilerplate responses without any concern for my resolving this issue. In the end, when my free account ran out, so did the support.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is a buggy, poorly designed product that is a waste of your funds."
1,stuipidest game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the game sucked because you had to log on to the website and register to play the game for ten dollars a month.thats 120 dollars a year. and if you want to waste your money thats fine with me ,but don't say i did'nt warn you."
4,City of Heroes not my thing,"If you dont like comic books you wont like this game. If you like good graphics you wont like this game. If you like quick servers you wont like this game. If you like making a character look like the tick or something like that. You still probably wont like this game.Keeping with the fact that its the year 2004 i want something better than this junk. I came, i saw, i left thankfully and took as much money back from this game as i could get out of. If you buy by accident sell it. Sell it fast. Even distributors are agreeing about this and making special deals for you to get it. They're tring to get rid of this game."
2,Good overall.,"I have enjoyed playing this game. I only give it three stars due to the constant changing of the superhero's powers. As your superhero increases in level, you will choose powers and enhance those powers to your liking. As soon as you design your superhero the way you like, you log on one day and the game has a new version with changes to some of your powers. I think it's also safe to say that the changes that I have seen so far have weakened most powers. This may not seem like an issue to some of you but it is very frustrating to spend 4-5 hours a week for a few months playing this game just to have your favorite powers drastically changed. I actually cancelled my account over the last version. My two superheroes powers were so drastically changed that it was not fun to play them anymore. Beware!! If you like stability, do not buy this game!!!"
3,sweet game sucks they keep changing it :(,"this game is a really really fun game while some might like it for a month i have enjoyed it for a long time the only problem is they keep changing the game i've learned to just go with the flow and just addapt to the changes, other then the changes and the fact that the game at day 1 was better then the game right now this game is still really cool and fun and if your a new player you'll enjoy the game and if your old then just addapt to the changes like i have and still have a great time and a good toon that was as good as he was on day 1"
1,Tedious so fast that it cannot justify the monthly fee.,"This is the very first MMORPG I have tried. After playing it for a month, I am definitely not impressed. I knew about the monthly fee and read many differing reviews so I decided to give this game a go. The character customization is the only thing I really enjoyed. Afterwards, the sheer amount of just running around and clicking the same buttons over and over again just to attack, attack, attack. What this game seriously needs is something besides talking to an npc or attacking. The incredible amount of time it takes to level up and complete later missions of just fighting, fighting, fighting made me truly ask myself: why is this worth $15.00 a month? I could get more fun out of the original Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. I would only recommend this to a person who is both a true comic book and MMORPG fan."
4,CoH saves NCSoft in america,"If it wasn't for City of Heroes, NCSoft would be in big trouble in America. After Lineage II gets done flopping (they are already down to less than 40,000 subscribers) CoH will be their only reason to stay afloat in the US.CoH is a great game. It would be fun even if it was a single player game! Yes, the missions are repetitive and the leveling grind gets pretty steep past 30 (there's 50 levels), but it's a lot of fun getting there. Diverse characters with clearly defined roles, gives your character a lot of power to control the flow of battles. The developers are constantly adding new, free content to make this one of the best values in online gaming. Unfortunately, there isn't any PVP to speak but an expansion called City of Villains is due in 2005. Better build up your character now for the bloodshed to come! If you're a fan of this genre, don't miss CoH."
4,Best MMoRPG of 2004,"For me the two biggest MMoRPG games that came out recently have been Star Wars Galaxies and City of Heroes. I think that in a battle between the two, COH is a clear winner.NCSoft has released a nearly bug free game, and they have been responsive to what few issues that did arise from its launch and first two patches.The key to enjoying this game, in my opinion, is to solo the early levels (1-10) and then to team up for middle levels (11 - 20, and then to alternate between the two in later levels.I have also found that the community (Liberty server) is far better then what I have experienced in other MMoRPGs. It is easy to find a group of people to team up with, and most people are always willing to help out when needed.Overall this is an exceptional game, well worth the cost and monthly fee.If you are interested in this game, or others that I am currently playing, contact me at : www.thefist.org/yabbse This is a forum dedicated to computer gaming and other interests."
1,"Might be fun, if I could play it....","Don't bother buying CoH at this point, unless you also plan on buying City of Villains. Otherwise, you'll get stuck trying to download a 2.5 Gb 'patch' that routinely disconnects and resets (Its been 3 days since I bought the game and I STILL can't get the patch downloaded...on a cable connection). Meanwhile, my '1 month of free play' is ticking away, completely unavailable to me.Whats in the patch? Mostly, City of Villains content...yep. I can't play the game because I'm stuck dl'ing information on their OTHER game.If I ever DO get to play, this'd better be a darn good game. Otherwise, I'll be busting down some doors at NC. This is NOT a good start."
1,Beware before you purchase!,Recently purchased this game as a gift for my teenager. Make sure your system has the proper requirements before buying. I thought we had a good sound/video card and have been told that it needs to be upgraded. That and the $14.95 monthly subscription should be prominently labeled on the package and on this site!
1,The Developers continually make your characters obsolete.,"I bought this game over a year ago and had a blast for the first six months spending hundreds of hours playing. Then, the developers decided to 'improve' the game by making my two main characters virtually useless. Despite repeated complaints from a large portion of the subscribers, the Developers refused to remedy the situation or even provide alternatives. This is not the only instance of this happening either. Each new 'edition' of the game makes some poor player's character obsolete. In frustration a large number of CoH players have inactivated their accounts. I expect the same will continue with CoV and other games developed by this company. They turned what could have been a fabulous MMORF into a frustrating experience."
2,Could have been better,"I had been waiting for this game for a long time. This was an awesome game, for the first week. After that it starts to get really repetitive and pretty boring. Right now I am stuck with a 6 month subscription because they don't give refunds and's what's worse is I can't go trade this game in because once the CD Key is used it can't be used again. So I make a new super hero, have fun with them for about an hour, then the boredom sets in again. I would not buy this game unless you are super hardcore comic fan. Even then it might be iffy!"
2,...,"I was NOT impressed by Dark One Lite's ""Tribute to John Mayer"", but I gave it two starts because it was indeed at tribute, abeit not a very good one, but a tribute none-the-less. They get bonus points just for it being John Mayer :). Past that, the production, recording, voices, and instrumentals are NOT up to par. Do your self a favour and don't get it."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"The existence of this CD reminds me of the days of Beatlemania at its peak, when all and sundry would bring out a Beatle anything in the hope of amassing a small fortune. Admirers of Mayer could understandably take offence at the pale imitations of his work offered herein by performers so minute in stature that their names don't even appear, but I would encourage a different response: smile, nod, and be assured in what you know already - that John Mayer and the music he makes now and in the future will be around long after this ""tribute"" has been consigned where it belongs."
1,John Mayer should sue!,This is awful. Tributes are supposed to sound at least decent. This sounds like it was produced in someone's bathroom. I swear I heard a toilet flush. Total crap fest. Thanks.
1,Woefully Inadequate,"Well, like one other reviewer, I don't own this either. I merely clicked 'listen' above these reviews, and got as far as Why Georgia. Then stopped. Its so bad."
1,totally amused,"Didn't buy, just clicked on 'listen'. Is this CD a joke? B/c I can't stop laughing..."
1,Do NOT buy an IBM hard drive - they FAIL,"I lost 2 months worth of data - thousands and thousands of dollars worth of time. It was my backup drive. Now another one has failed on me. I had a hard time diagnosing it, because the system could not detect the other drive in my system, after the IBM failed. I thought it was a software problem. Then the drive started buzzing. My husband removed the drive, and then our computer worked again. When I shake it, it rattles. I talked to a guy in a computer store, and he told me the drives are a tragedy. He didn't even want to look at it. He didn't even want it in his store. He said there was nothing he could do for me. He suggested Seagate, or Maxtor, or just about anything but IBM. He said IBM do not make good products. He said he would not even carry their junk. He advised me not to exchange it with IBM. He said the replacement would fail just causing more trouble. He told me to ""throw it in the lake,"" but I think I'll just throw it in the trash."
1,My drive failed me!,"My IBM DeskStar drive failed me. I've owned it for less than 4 months. However, I did irretrievably lose important data. A speedy harddrive is useless if it is not reliable.I was unaware IBM DeskStar's history of reliability problems prior to this purchase. (I've owned many computers and drives, and although I've had my share of problems in the past, I've never had a hard drive quit on me like this one did). I will be replacing it with a Western Digital.While it WAS functioning, it did work beautifully."
2,High perforemance but quality low.,"After two years of medium workload HDD became extremely noisy and show error: ""Excessive vibration"". IBM replaced my drive with USED REFURBISHED HDD. I didn't make mistake. I don't know what was first USED or REFURBISHED. But anyway drive body has a lot of testing tags and scratches that it was not really matter how it was used. I just want to mentioned I got same problem with TWO DIFFERENT HDD BOTH IBM 180GX 60Gb. BOTH FAILED AFTER TWO YEARS ON DIFFERENT COMPUTERS."
2,Far out of date!,"Unfortunately, being published in 1983, ""Boston, Then and Now"" should be titled ""Boston, Then and THEN"". It has been almost 20 years since the ""now"" photos were taken and Boston has changed greatly in that period. I would love to see a reissue of this book with updated photos. Right now, it makes little sense to purchase a book so out of date."
2,a padded short story,"shallow, sophomoric. the story was good, but choppily told and the sex was like sugar-water on steak: didn't belong, had no purpose, tasted wierd. the acusations that this is a money grab after the events of sept 11 are definitely misguided, this book was well in the works long before and was on bookshelves that week. it's too bad that it is less of a tribute to firefighters (as it claims to be) and more of a tribute to shallow relationships. overall it seems like it was a short story that got dragged out, stretched and padded."
2,Some reservations,"I wanted to like this book, but there are some major problems with it. I am firefighter with two sons in their early teens whom I encourage to read and who are keen to enter the fire service, but as as Christian, I would not give them this book because of some of the kinky doings described. The characters were not well developed and had very little depth, particularly the main female character."
2,Not realistic,"I looked forward to reading this book because I am very interested in the subject matter, but it didn't live up to my expectations. The author does not have a realistic idea of what motivates firefighters. Most of the most highly regarded ones I know are normal people, not a bunch of kinks."
1,Poorly written!,I thought this book would be interesting. Was I wrong! Who wrote it - an infatuated 15 year old?Don't waste your money or your time. There is no depth to any of the characters and the storyline jumps around enough to make you dizzy.Horrible
1,DO NOT be fooled.,The title and cover design leads one to believe that the book would be an uplifting firemens tale. And while this book does in fact contain descriptions of firefighters and firefighting it is awkwardly synthesized with pathetic soft-porn and b-grade woe. If you thought you couldn't be more depressed by the events of September read this book and find out how low marketing and opportunism can go.
1,You've got to be kidding me...,"Is there any doubt that the author had her friends all write reviews??? Most likely she wrote a review herself. Come on...Given her penchant for S&M, I'm sure this is an interesting book, but let us not call it ""an astonishing important novel"". I'm sure the firefighter whom the book was supposedly loosely based on (and later died at the Trade Center) finds it ""astonishing"" that Wald coicidentally starting dating him at the same time she wanted to write a book about firefigheters.Have some class and have some respect for this fallen fighter: don't buy this book."
2,Different perspective from a man once in the same firehouse,"I approach this book from a different perspective than most readers, in that I actually knew the heroic firefighter that ( as it is reported in the press)the leading character, Jonah Malone, was based on. Although the author has based some episodes on great rescues in his career, it seems that she missed the boat by giving no clue as to why this man was so beloved by firefighters and all who knew him long before his tragic death on 9/11. This warm, funny, compassionate, brilliant and humble man was a far more interesting character than the fictional (and at times rather boorish) Jonah Malone."
2,A mixed bag,"Some of the situations are interesting, but the previous reviewer is right that the author introduces too many characters and has too much going on to focus sufficiently on any character or situation. As for the raw description of the homoerotic-or whatever you want to call it- act with one firefighter, Jake Schiller,it didn't add anything, and I would rather not know about it. The Heart of the Hero, 3000 Degrees or anything by Dennis Smith (Report from Engine 82, Report from Ground Zero, Final Fire) all give a more compelling picture of firefighters."
2,Not a fulfilling ending,"This book was ok, but the last book had more of a attention getter. This book was slow and then it ended slowly. It never really got exciting during the whole story until they find Tate's last message to them and then it is a little more entertaining but still slow and kind of boring. I had to read it because the last book was so cool and I had to know how it ended. Animorphs and Everworld at least had an open ending which made you think what happens now. With Remnants it is, this happens and that's it. The end. They never actually tell you exactly what happens to get the ending of this book. You will turn the page and start thinking ""I can't wait to see what happens next"" and then its ten years in the future and Jobs tells what its like now and that all the ending is."
1,just the style I wanted,"I was looking for a bra of this style but threw it in the box for donated items as it was scratchy, binding and generally uncomfortable. I have been struggling with uncomfortable bras for awhile so this one was no improvement. I washed it hoping to just soften it up and make it more comfortable. but no go. I was never able to figure out what made it so scratchy. under the arms and in the back at the closure. Don't buy this bra if you want comfort. It wouldn't adjust enough to make it comfortable around either."
4,So comfy !,Ever so comfortable & easy to wear. Cotton makes it feel more natural. And thank goodness there are no wires !
1,Penitential straps,"By using rough, stiff cords as straps, Jockey has turned a promise of comfort into yet another punishing harness. Washing doesn't help."
2,Little or No support,Launders easily and dries quickly. But more like a 'training' bra. Really very little support for anyone over the age of 14.
2,not the bra i wanted,"This is not the bra I wanted. Not comfortable. Difficult (for me) to adjust very skinny bra straps. I have a bad feeling Jockey stopped making the one I want -- straps are not adjustable, very comfortable wireless bra (model no. I think 324-4726)This one that I'm reviewing (324-4701) is also wireless but the straps are much skinnier though the material is somehow thicker, and the adjustable strap slider is really hard to move around.Plus the cross-cut v shape of the bra I wanted is gone too. This has a sports bra look to it. Not very attractive."
1,Defining what harmony is not,"This would be truly wonderful music if only both of the singers actually could actually sing well. The female manages to hit the right notes most of the time, and when she misses, it is not a spectacularly bad miss. But the guy---Eeee Gads!! This is what happens when the tone deaf decide to harmonize. Still, this is a good enough bit of music for people new to the Craft, who tend to think anything even remotely Pagan is a good buy. And Moonstruck do have a nice chant or two during which, blessedly, the guy sings so softly he doesn't ruin it. The lyrics are cutesy fluff and on a Silver RavenWolf level, and again, the chants are good. Not a recommended tape for anyone with musical expertise, particularly in vocals, but ok if you just like witchy music for the sake of itself and aren't too picky."
1,very disappointed,"AFter reading other reviews here, I couldn't wait to get this CD. Now I can't wait to see if my used CD store will give me anything in trade. The vocals are horrendous- particulary the male vocal is rarely on key. Musical quality is not just ""unpolished"" it is awful. The lyrics are heartfelt, but would be better served being sung by someone who can carry a tune. Instead it is a painful droning attempts at song. Download mp3s first, before you spend $. See if the tone grates on your nerves. I sure wish I had. Check out CDs like ""ancient mother"" instead."
4,Awesome Group!,"To listen to this album is to step inside the circle with your pagan brothers and sisters! Moonstruck is not a group of pagans writing whatever music they can sell; the words to these songs are entirely pagan in theme. Very rock oriented, it is great inspirational music... a way to attune yourself while commuting, cleaning house, whatever, whenever you don't have the time to set up full ritual space yourself, you can just pop this in and immediately step between the worlds. Awesome, uplifting lyrics, decent recording and performance. Keep it up, Moonstruck!"
3,A Disappointment,"I just received the Complete National Anthems of the World and have listened to every one of them. I enjoy the anthems and the presentation. But I was disappointed that the anthems didn't include the singing. Without the singing, the musical pieces lose their contexts. It is interesting to observe that, with relatively few exceptions, although most people are proud of their national anthems, they are loathe to listen to and enjoy them. The producers of this collection missed a great opportunity to turn the national song into a genuine musical masterpiece by not including the sung lyrics."
4,Not Bad,"I am an avid salt water fisherman but thought I'd try the game after I downloaded the TB4 demo. After fishing with my son over our LAN (on the easy setting)we had several large bass to our credit. We enjoyed it so much that after what seemed to be about an hour, it was 3AM. One thing we didn't like is that even when you switch to the heaviest gear available, heavy rod and 40lb line, we still had 5 lb bass breaking the line. We still managed to land a few in the 13 lb range though, and it was a lot of fun,"
5,Love the game. My daughter plays it too.,"I love fishing games and this one is a perfect game for those who love fishing games also. My 11 year old daughter plays it and she loves it too. Whenever I play this game, I feel like I am really fighting a fish. I like to fish for catfish, and my biggest cat is 39.13. It took me a long time to catch it, but it was worth it. If you love to play games and love to fish, this is the game for you."
4,good height - legs are hard to open,"light this for the height - nice for use as background light stand, but the legs are so tough to pry open...I just leave them in the opened position most of the time, which then makes it hard to store..."
3,Ok item,"This thing was ok. Makes it a little hard to use the directional pad on the phone, but other than that it is good at protecting the phone."
4,Great for cleaning oilfield clothes,Great for cleaning oilfield clothes. Put on the clothes take to laundry mat days later and it removes all the stains. Great on the hands also
3,Great product but the pump does not work.,"This is a top of the line hand cleaner. Unfortunatly, the pump never worked. I have to stick the pump in and out of it to get to use the product."
2,Probably for more advanced Spanish students.,This is a great resource but I want to copy the casettes to a DVD and my iPod but haven't figured how to do it with my rack system yet. This selection is in my opinion for more advanced Spanish students than me.Also the book was heavily marked in ballpoint pen but still acceptable. It will come in very handy after I learn more Spanish Basics.
5,Excellent,"I've been using this controller for over 4 months now without a single problem. I actually like the ""feel"" of this controller much more that the run-of-the mill Sony controller that comes with the PS2. NOTE: Previous reviewer either has a faulty controller or PS2, because this controller is works perfectly for me. I may buy a 2nd controller due to the good quality and spectacular price.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality, good looking, and responsive controller for gaming on his/her PS2.I'm a big fan of Logitech products. I also have Logitech speakers and keyboard for my computer and am VERY satisfied with their quality and performance."
2,Uh... not so much.,"I have bought 3 of these and they all inevitably stopped working within about 2 months. While they were working though, it was great, the size of the controller and overall handling of the controller was so much nicer than the standard Sony controller. I doubt this has anything to do with me considering all the games I own on the PS2 are RPGs and don't really involve any button mashing or strict usage, but then again you never know. I wouldn't recommend this overall for a lasting controller, however Logitech products are normally very decent."
1,Don't buy!!!,"I bought one brand new and it stopped working after just a few uses. More often than not, you will get the message saying it is not connected to the console. No wonder I got it so cheap...this product is defective. I will never buy third party controllers ever again. Go get a Sony instead. 0 stars!!!"
1,Shoes run a size too small,I was very disappointed in these shoes. They run a size too small and it was too expensive to return them. I sold them for half the price.
3,Made Christmas more interesting!,"The sound is really poor on both movies. Neither one had any remastering done to them.Christmas Evil is an ok sit-thru-once type horror movie. It's about a guy who saw his mommy make out with Santa when he was a kid and turns into a sadistic killer. A little short on logic, and not from the main character, but on things like the towns people chasing him down with, get this, torches. They apparently had them laying around for the next rape and pillage session in their town. There is not a stake anywhere about for the burnings-at-the-stake night, which surprised me.Silent Night bloody night is a far darker film. Although the final outcome isn't when the film leads you to believe, it's still a creepy entry into the Christmas-gone-slasher category. Best actress: Fran Stevens as Tess."
3,entertaining to watch,"This set is okay for a rental, but I wouldn't pay a whole lot of money to own it. Got this really cheap for under $5.00 I believe. Both of these films are really dated, but still entertaining to watch. They aren't in widescreen which I didn't like. They also are both crammed on a one-sided disc which takes some away from the picture quality. ""Christmas Evil"" (1980) does have some gore, and alot more than ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" (1973), but I actually preferred the 1973 movie better. SNBN has a much better storyline that actually makes sense. While Christmas Evil was entertaining, I thought the storyline was terrible. It was not as good as I had expected. If you can get this for $4.00, buy it. If not, rent these two instead."
3,it looks nice,"we got this for my sons brewer themed room. it looks good, but as a mat it isnt great. its too small and it slides around. other than cosmetics its not a good buy."
3,Classic,"I diddn't buy this game for intence grafix or for streaming online play. I bought this game because years ago I loved to play it and lately I just wanted to play it again, its still fun and although it did not come in an expensive factory sealed box, it was a quality buy. thanks"
4,"Good reviews by the authorities in each field, but too pricy","Several leading scholars summarize their research and main contributions in their specialties, e.g., Duffie, Campbell, Singleton, etc.... The chapters are useful for those who already know quite a lot. They are not suitable for a learner.It is way too over-priced for such a book. As a graduate student, I had to watch my food expenses in order to buy this book. I wish those extremely wealthy authors and the publisher could be less greedy, be more into promoting the scientifc research in financial economics rather than trying to grasp every penny from my pocket.I don't think this is a book for graduate students (too expensive), however, for professors, it might be worth it."
4,Joyful Noise IS,"The story is weak but the music is great. Our whole family enjoyed the movie. We recommend it for a warm, comfy feeling."
5,Dolly and Queen wonderful together,"What an enjoyable movie. Full of music, a nice story to go with it. This is a movie the whole family can watch."
4,"Joyful, indeed.","This movie is not going to change your life, but it will definitely make you smile. Is it silly? Of course it is! It was intended to be. But it also made me laugh and hum along. It is cotton candy in the movie world--light and utterly without substance, but delightful all the same."
4,The title says it all!,"Because I am a Dolly Parton fan, I pre-ordered this DVD movie and viewed it last night. For sure, it is Joyful Noise and inspiring. I am one of the few odd balls that is not a Glee fan and so the supporting cast and dialog was lost on me. The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and 9 to 5 remain to be my Dolly Parton favorites. And, in one of the Dolly Parton interviews, she admitted that while she was disappointed with the overall public approval rating and lower than expected ticket sales-it was a fun movie to make, she loved working with everyone in the cast, and sometimes her expectations of a big hit are not always fulfilled.If you like Gospel music, a light-hearted romantic comedy and are a fan of Queen Latifah and/or Dolly Parton, then you will probably enjoy Joyful Noise and should add it to your collection."
4,Good Musical/Gospel Movie,"This was actually really entertaining, I wasn't sure how it would be when I rented it but it has some really nice plot points. I don't want to give away too much here so I'll leave it as if you enjoy gospel music, or musicals in general you would probably enjoy this. This does have a decidedly religious slant (which is obvious really since the story-line is about a church choir) so if you're not of the Christian persuasion you may not love it, but I'm not even super religious and I enjoyed it."
3,It was okay,"I love both Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah so maybe that's what made my expectations more than the movie satisifed. I enjoyed it, glad I watched it and glad I didn't buy it but rented it first."
1,Blu-ray Review: 'Joyful Noise',"Very rarely do I see a film that makes me want to turn it off within ten minutes of putting it in my Blu-ray player. It's even rarer when my wife feels the same way. If it's a romantic comedy or features musical numbers, she's usually onboard for the full ride. Warner's ""Joyful Noise "" even had her looking for the ""Stop"" button on the remote.The ""Joyful Noise"" Two-Disc Blu-ray / DVD / UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack will satisfy people who liked this movie. They'll no doubt be excited by all the special features included in the deal. Judging the release for consumers, this is worth the price if you're looking at it for the content alone. The quality of the film is a whole other story."
1,The Best Part was Queen Latifah,The Movie was beyond AWEFUL!!! Dolly Parton was ok and queen Latifa was the delight of the movie but the story was a replica of Sister Act 2 minus the soul and comedy of Whoopi but a all in all a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! NOT RECOMMENDEDGo Find Sister Act and tell me im wrong
5,"Welcome back, Dolly!","The description and marketing for ""Joyful Noise"" is misleading. Do not expect a story about two choir members ""facing off"" for the choir group's direction into a national competition. It's a subplot. The real premise is centered around two teenagers falling in love. You also shouldn't expect much from Dolly Parton or Queen Latifah. They're ""mentor characters"" for the premise's two teenagers, Jeremy Jordon and Keke Palmer. Despite its bait-and-switch marketing and common cliche storytelling, ""Joyful Noise"" featured fantastic performances throughout and entertaining musical numbers. Keke Palmer is stunning and it was GREAT seeing Dolly Parton back on the silver screen. My favorite musical number involved Dolly Parton and Kris Kristofferson. 5/5."
5,Joyful Noise,if you like feel good movies with comical overtones? This is the movie for you. This is something I could watch over and over again. Dolly Parton has a hit with this movie
1,"Fluff and not great music,either!","They really removed the ""church"" from ""Church choir"" since the only ""religion"" they seem to have is a cheap parody of what people who've never actually gone to church might think Christians are like. As for ""Choir"" it's more like a few talented people showboating with some backup singers. The music reminds me of South Park Episode 709, where Cartman said gospel music is just love songs with ""Jesus"" thrown in a lot. And did I mention you're supposed to be pulling for the love life of a woman who had a mishap in a one-night-stand with a choir member?Nothing really redeeming about this film, not even the story. Don't waste your time."
2,JOYFUL NOISE,Did not feel it represented true christianity properly though there were numerous scenes that were funny. Would not care to see it again.
2,Boring,"I was very suprised and disappointed with the movie.First the movie did not hold my interest, just certainparts were interesting. And I must have gotten a bad onebecause the lighting kept getting lighter than darker in somescenes. Since I have opened it...to the Goodwill it goes.Maybe someone else will like better, and that is the good part."
1,YuUkkkkky,"This is the worst movie that the 'Queen' has been in.It was so boring that I fell asleep twice.It also makes people of faith look stupid and gullible, but what do you expect from hollywood. Don't waste your money or your time."
5,Joyful Noise,"Entertaining movie. Good cast. Dolly Parton and Queen Lahtifa are a good pairing. Truly a Joyful Noise. Arrived on time, safely packaged."
4,Joyful Noise,"I thought the movie was extremely entertaining. The music was great and timed well. The acting was excellent and very believable. I would recommend this film for families, young couples dating and those that enjoy good musicals."
5,Joyful Noise,I enjoyed the movie very much. The quality was good. The acting was fun. It is definately a movie that any family can watch together. If you like music then you will enjoy this.
3,Slightly entertaining,Slightly entertaining. I did watch the whole movie. Kept hoping it would get better. The music sounded good. Dolly looks great for her age.
4,Good Movie,Thought I wouldn't like it but I rented it through the redbox. Turned out it was surprisingly good. I recommend this movie.
3,joyful noise dvd,"The video is wonderful, sound track pumped up and ready to dance and sing along withMy only issue is the wait for the DVD to arrive. It took 2 weeks, that is just too long."
4,joyfulnoise,this movie was a great movie with lots of singing and a great cast i felt happy after watching this movie it was a feel good movie
2,Too slow,"Plot was predictable and too few laughs. I like Queen Latifah, yet this movie did her no justice. Down right stupid in parts."
4,Great movie...,"This is a great movie, although not a movie to actually buy. I wish it was better, as I had high hopes, but disappointed a little."
5,Joyful Noise,"I loved the plot, the singing was good; just enough for the movie and the acting was believable. I am a Dolly Pardon fan."
1,no!,"This was not a joyful noise, it was a dreadful disappointment. Most people who order the type video that this one was advertised as, are looking to be lifted emotionally. Very few people who see a title that this one seems to represent, are not looking for another Viva drama, regardless to whom it is presented by."
1,Not a good movie.,"Hmmm. Review must contain at least 20 words. How about this movie is awful, awful, awful! I'm just glad that it was early on so that we stopped watching and didn't invest any more time in it."
3,Extremely pleasant movie,I was moved by the rendition of 'Man in the mirror' which was the best I've ever heard. The rest of the movie had good music as well but I'm not sure I would've watched the whole thing if I hadn't been sucked in by the exquisitely performed 'man in the mirror'.
2,Boring,"There is no good story line to the movie. The music was so-so, but not good enough to overcome the boredom. Kept waiting for it to get better.....it didn't."
1,Joyful Noise,"Usually, Dolly plays an exciting big role. Disappointed throughout the film. A nothing film. Poor acting was a strong part of this poor review."
1,Horribly disappointing!,"This film, starring Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton promised, at the very least, tofeature great music. Because the lips are out of sync with the soundtrack, the effectwas spoiled. The plot is nothing exceptional, but would have been a satisfactory vehiclefor the music, had the dialogue not been just plain awful. It's not clear whether the actingitself is as bad as it seems, or if the actors are hard put to make something of their corny,stilted,and uninspired lines. I love Dolly, but this is not how I'd like to think of her!!I expected morefrom a project involving two big-name professionals."
1,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the music but the story completely misrepresented the Christian faith and at times made fun of it. The one person who realized that their singing should have been for the glory of God was portrayed as up-tight and hard nosed. She was converted in the end and joined the others for the win. The teenage daughter was encouraged to not be a ""Church girl"" and disobey her mom and do what she felt like. The movie sent a very poor message. Even if your not a Christian you can at least respect the choices of those who are."
1,What did I expect?,"Poor plot, poor song selection, poorly done. A real bore and waste of talent.Too much hype and too little performance."
3,Light and easy to enjoy,I really loved the music but the story is too forced and I can't help staring at Dolly Patton's face.
1,Just Plain Noise,"I personally found this movie to be highly disappointing especially when you consider all of the well known names featured. However, that doesn't mean that everyone would feel that way about it. SMS"
4,Onward Joyful Noise,Fun movie. Enjoyed the music and the actors. Good summertime entertainment. Missed it in the theater and was glad Amazon had it for rent.
5,Joyful Noise DVD,"Saw this movie at the theater and loved it. I new I wanted to buy it when it came out on DVD, so I just waited for it to come down to an afordable price for me. Dolly and Queen Latifa are great together. Loved the music and was a feel good movie all in one. They should make more feel good movies."
4,"Very enjoyable, would watch again","I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. There were quite a few laugh out loud moments, the music was great, and the plot while convoluted in some places was decent. There were some definite problems with the movie (plot holes, underdeveloped stories), but as a whole, I thought it was great. Good movie for family night"
3,It's okay,"Good music but so-so acting, which was expected. My daughter and I didn't expect much, but liked the music -"
3,A family friendly movie,"If gma, mom, dad, and the kids all need something wholesome to watch this might do the trick. It was an acceptable attempt but it felt like it had been done before. Dolly Prton and Queen Latifa have great chemistry on screen and play off of each other well. The romance between the adolescents lacked as did their acting. Perhaps it would have been better suited for the Hallmark Channel at Christmas Time than the big screen."
4,Joyful,Uplifting and funny!! A welcome change from blood and guts and dark drama's. Great singing....Glee like. I recommend this movie
3,Joyful indeed,"Although fairly predictable, Joyful Noise is fun to watch. A bit like a longer Glee episode! Definitely a feel good movie."
3,Movie Rental,Was OK for rental. I would not go back and purchase. Kids like it but did not try to rent a second time or anything. I don't think it was watched more than once during rental.
2,Looking for Standards? They only come in Double,"I don't understand those we are going on about how wholesome this movie was. I like Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton, but the truth is, the movie is not good by Hollywood standards, neither can it be called a Christian movie; too much bad language and sexual situations to be the latter category. ""Joyful Noise"" does not know what it is, and frankly, I do not know either."
1,Not so joyful,"I just don't bother to rate movies. This one had to be spoken about. It is not a movie that upholds Christian values. In fact, it has many people sleeping together and acts like this is normal. It also has a song about strippers and has a total disregard to any character. I just could not believe what I was watching. A Hollywood movie with a Christian label. Very deceptive, beware!!"
2,Joyful Noise,"Always wanted to see this film. I love Dolly PArton and I love Queen Latifah but I didn't love this movie. Maybe if I was just a little more into Gospel music and that culture, I would have appreciated it more"
2,Not so joyful review,I was so excited about this movie and then was very disappointed while watching. The plot was predictable and the performances by the actors was very weak. My advice is to wait until Prime offers it for free and then watch it.
4,It was ok....I expected a little more,So I started watching the movie on Mother's day and just finished a couple of days ago. We stop watching to go somewhere and I wasn't really impressed with what I had already seen so I wasn't in a hurry to get back to it. I expected it to be so much better than it was. Not that it was horrible I just expected more. The middle to the end was the best part of the movie the rest wasn't that great. It's one of those movies that you watch one time and You don't watch again unless you want to hear the music and/or see the performances if that but once is enough.
5,Joy to my ears,I ordered this movie for the soundtrack. I knew it would have good songs snd arrangements. Clearly not academy award but that wasnt the aim. Good music and singers got me out of my seat to move to the joyful noise. Those looking for a Christian based movie need to stick to your 'ol church hymns.
5,AWESOME MOVIE !!!!!!!,"All I am going to say for those who have not seen it, Rent it or buy it, you willnot be sorry, it has great music and good story line as well!!!!!!"
2,PPFFFTT!,"Well, I must say the singers/dancers were great. Dolly Parton has the voice of an angel, and HEY! Kris Kristoferson was a nice surprise. The plot was just too corny and not well written. The ending was exactly like I expected from the beginning! NO surprises.....and Dolly Parton didn't look one bit like herself! Give up the P.S. Dolly!"
2,sappy,The writing seemed incredibly awkward at times -- which made the acting seem contrived (IMO). It's time you won't get back - so I would pass if given the choice
3,Not too good a movie,"This whole movie was very unrealistic & contrived. I enjoyed the voices of Queen Latifa & Dolly Parton, but I was still very disappointed in the movie."
2,Julies movie reviews,"In my opinion,this movie let me down!! I really thought I was going to watch a very entertaining flick but found myself continuing to wait for something to happen. I almost stopped the movie but decided to finish it only because I rented it. Good thing I did because it finally perked up towards the end. That is where it finally gave me a bit of what I seek in a movie, entertainment!! Dolly and Queen Latifa finally showed their great talent after all but like I said, you 'll have to wait for it."
5,joyful noise,"Joyful noise was a great movie for a family with teens. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh and cry and is about family, friends and christian values Joyful Noise is one to check out."
3,Joyful Noise,"I enjoyed this film. I am a Dolly fan and loved her quote ""Plastic surgeon's have to eat too"", or something like it.The only thing that rankled me was it overly religious. Hillsongs' hand all over it.Just loved the singing and the actors were likeable."
3,"Great Singing, Not Good Acting!","The singing is great, but the movie falls flat on acting. It's like everybody tried too hard, and it just didn't work. The chemistry between Queen Latifa and Dolly Parton's characters is particularly boring to watch. Best to rent this movie or just purchase the sound track and save yourself some money."
2,corny and irritating,"This movie really irritated me. The characters were supposed to be genuine and make you like them but instead they were very shallow. The music was okay but seriously, do all church choirs put the goal of winning as the end all, do all? I would hope not."
1,Could have been great = Slams Christian values,"The movie had a great premise. I thought it would be on the lines of ""Sister Act"". A clean comedy with joyful music. It was until someone had to interject profanity into the movie for some strange reason. THEN we had choir members sleeping with each other - yeah - that was funny and so very Christian like. It was so sad to see beautiful voices wasted. And Dolly - what were you thinking??So - turned it off (after we paid to rent it) and read a book....."
4,Combat Flight Simulater,"Very easy to fly the air craft, good directions, graphics could be better.Missions are good and simple,I was exspecting a better graphics,"
2,Not very playable,"Most of what is said in the review is correct, but what's the point of fantastic realism and graphics if the experience of playing is boring? The flying experience is slow (you'd think you were piloting a lead brick no matter what plane you choose) and the game slows down considerably when in a large dogfight. All the realism in the world won't make up for this. If you're experienced with the Red Baron games by Dynamix, pass on this one, Red Baron leaves it in the dust."
3,It's worth the discount price.,"It's fun to play in the beginning, but it's not the type you want to play very often. Too much of an arcade type, even if you have an up to date system."
1,Joystick does not work,"Program loads fine but with no workable joystick, which I have one (a older Logitech) is useless to use. do you recommend a joystick that will work windows 7 ?Gene Carpenter"
2,Combat Flight Simulator,ITs to old the graphics are horrible and there are way less controls than modern sims
1,Microsoft again,"... The graphics are poor, as is the frame rate. The background is terrible. Naturally this product doesn't work well with anything that isn't made by Microsoft, including my Joystick. You have to use the rotate as a rudder, which makes using the rudder difficult. If possible, go to someone else, such as Jane's for a good simulator."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have been playin flight sims since I was about six years old. I have played many that I didn't like at first, but after time I liked them. This, however is not one of them. The controls are terrible. The training missions have some jerk instructor yelling at you whenever you don't do something right. I wish I would have known this was going to be such a frustrating and impossible game. Aces over Europe was much better."
2,I Hate CFS1,"Combat flight simulator 1 is the worst ww2 game I ever played. It has bad graphics, terrible controls,and unrealistic weapons. It takes 400 mg rounds to nail a kraut! Even Battlefield 1942 puts it to shame."
3,"Decent, but lacking","CFS continues MS line of great looking flight sims, but falls short on the combat side. Missions are repeatitive and there aren't many of them. While changeable options allow you to customize how realistic your plane is, it is often hard to find a middle ground that truly creates the feel of being an actual pilot. Rather than CFS, I'd recommend getting Janes WWII Fighers, it continues the wonderful Janes tradition of finding an excellent balance between realism and fun."
2,Snore,"This is a joke of a game. Let's see, a campaign can be finished in an hour. The AI makes you conclude that enemy fighter pilots have a deep vindictive nature (is mine the only plane in the sky?). All in all, this game is like a new level of computer chess--boring as hell, and yet somehow intelligently scripted [SCRIPTED]!"
3,Kind of Fun,Combat Flight Simulator is fun but not very realistic and it has really bad grafics. Somethimes when your playing the game a enemy shoots your plane and then theres bullet holes in the cockpit window and you survive. If that really happened the pilot would be dead. Also the planes dont try to move away from you when you shooting them so it is really easy to shoot down planes. I shot down 72 planes once. Combat Flight Simulator is not alot of money to buy so it kind of worth getting if you like WW2 combat flying game. Combat Flight Simulator 2 and 3 are a lot more fun and realistic.
2,Boring,I have quite a few flight simulation games and this one gets boring fast. Their are very few missions to choose from and not a lot of aircraft to choose from either.
2,hard,"this game is very hard. it only has guns, no bombs and the plain is hard to control i recomend u dont get this combat game because it is hard to stear and doesnt stear fast to get out of trouble of other plains. DONT GET IT."
4,Coin purse..exactly,"This product was good, and it came plenty in time. The only thing I recommend is to make sure you read the measurements, because the picture makes it look bigger than it is. Tou could probably fit something the size of a playing card in it (if that helps). Other than that I have been satisfied with the product. It has a nice feel to it and the color is the color pictured."
1,"Worked Great for 2 months, then ...","Bought this can opener because I thought it was a good idea that it produces no sharp edges and it has a 25 year guarantee. But after using it for two months to open two cans of dog food per day it slowly stopped working properly. At first the lids opened perfectly after one revolution of the can, then part of the lid did not detach from the can, then it took two revolutions of the can before the lid fully detached, now it barely works at all. I have the receipt so I will return it.Poor quality metal seems to be the problem in the de-crimper mechanism, the design is good, but the component quality is poor."
1,Great idea - poor durability,"This can opener was purchased about a year ago, based upon some glowing reviews that were posted at the time. My usage started out well, and I was impressed with the concept of cutting below the top and leaving no sharp edge to contend with.Little by little, I encountered times when it would not work at all and I wondered if it was the type of can lid that was the problem, or?As of today, I can no longer remove the lid of ANY can with it, and must revert to my trusty old opener which cuts from the top. It was a good idea extremely lacking in durability.Save your money and purchase something that will last."
4,One of Johnstone's Best,"Pretty much, if you've read one of William W. Johnstone's ""Home Town Armageddon"" novels, you've read them all. ""Toy Cemetery"" transcends the lot, though, and if Johnstone's horror appeals to you even a little, do not miss out on it. The Satanic kookiness of ""Toy Cemetery"" make it a work of Horror ""with a capital H"" and I think William W. Johnstone only achieves that with one other book, Jack-in-the-Box. These two books makes me wish Mr. Johnstone had devoted lots more of his effort toward Horror writing than he did."
3,Expensive - but it works well,"Being unhappy with the low-light performance of my PV-GS250 camcorder while filming indoors, I purchased this accessory. The product works, throwing a fair amount of illumination for a 3W bulb and produced a noticeable improvement over filming without the light. However, the light is not going to light up the whole room - it is best for filming closeup in dim environments.The light's design matches nicely with the video camera's style. Just be aware that the actual light is much smaller than it appears in the product photo on Amazon!The reason that this item only received 3 stars is due to its price. I'm not sure how Panasonic can justify charging MSRP $80 for an accessory which probably contains about $5 worth of components encased in plastic. However, if you want a genuine Panasonic accessory that integrates nicely with the camera's hotshoe I would recommend."
4,Great for backup and archiving. Too slow for speed intensive applications (e.g. video editing),"Set up and config is very easy. Driver for Windows Vista is now available from the web site. New firmware supports long file names. Comes formatted as NTFS.The only down side is that accessing the drive over the LAN is slower than if the drive were directly connected to the PC. I'm getting about 2 mega bytes per second.The other downer is that some features, such as being able to view the drive over the internet is a ""premium"" feature, which costs $8.00 per month.All in all, for backup, archiving, and centralizing files, this thing is great. I have several PCs in the house. This gadget let's me centralize music, photos, and back up everyones files. Also, I no longer have to worry about upgrading my PCs, since the important, ""My Documents"", folders are backed up.I would not recommend it for ""live"" use, such as for video editing or for use as virtual memory swap space."
3,Good for backup over LAN,"I purchased this drive to do automatic backups on a couple of computers at work. Installation was straightforward. Drive has been running for about two weeks with no problems.PC UseBackup is easy to setup. The EMC Retrospect HD (for WinXP) that comes with the drive is slow. The MioNet application will allow to access the contents of the hard drive from everywhere in the Internet.Apple UseUnfortunately the MioNet application is not available for MacOS. However, one can attach the drive as a CIFS device. I am currently performing backups with Retrospect Express that came with a Maxtor external hard drive.AdministrationThe web-base administrative application is easy to navigate, create shares, accounts, give permissions etc.Configuration and performanceLAN via LinkSys BEFSR41 router at 100Mbps.Mac backup performance: 125MB/min (20Mbps) via Retrospect Express (Maxtor edition), attached as CIFS device."
1,Stability problems,"Major stability problems. Drive keeps disappearing, ""fails to mount"" for not good reason. The included software requires subscription. Cannot access drive directly (via usb/firewire), you *have to* access it via the network. Would not recommend it to anybody."
2,500GMy Book World Edition Not Good fo Macs,"This would not be good for macs if you're looking to access it outside your network. But it works, and not the fastest. If you have a pc, it would be the best. I'm looking for another one. By the time I get something that works for me, i should have a few terrabites. LOL"
1,INCOMPATIBLE WITH MAC LION,"After installing Lion, I found that Time Machine won't work with the My World Book drive we have. From the on-line chatter on the subject, it looks like Western Digital doesn't think that's much of a problem. The moral of the story: Buy from professionals."
2,Pros and Mostly Cons,"I have had several experiences with Western Digital Network Accessed Storage devices (NAS). The one excellent thing about Western Digital is the ease with which you can get Phone Support.This does NOT compensate for a VERY poorly organised KnowledgeBase, or for the accompanying manual which seems only interested in getting you to register with Mio Net, a web access service. This seems to be the only thing they are thinking about. Go ahead, de-install Mio Net or it will not stop bugging you to register. De-installing it will not affect the NAS. WHEN it works (which is not often) the device practically installs and configures itself, and works great, but this is a gamble.Tech support technicians are mostly OK, but not the weekend crew."
5,Pleased,Very pleased with the WD My Book ethernet storage. I don't use the included software since I just needed a server. Works very well connected to my router.
1,Not the setup or service I expected...,"Sorry but after weeks of tech support from WD, conclusion is that the drive kinda works, but really doesn't.Maybe you should move on to another option."
3,Works great but is just slow.,"This product works great, just as described. I have had mine for 6 months and have had zero problems with it. The only issue with this product is that its read/write speed is slow as molasses. I use it to stream pictures over my gigabit network and that works fairly well. It actually streams my music fairly well also, the problem hits when the OS indexes the drive or any other operation calls it, then you get the occasional hiccup.Nothing major really just rare hiccups. In my opinion this makes a great network attached backup drive. For a streaming NAS take a look at the D-Link 323 for its speed at a good price."
1,STAY FAR FAR AWAY,"This is a 1990s style piece of hardware - promise everything. deliver nothing. Perhaps it would work on a wired internet, but on a wireless - it's totally hopeless. The point of a large hard drive is so you can move large files and folder to it. Forget it. Every time you try to move a large folder onto the drive it cuts out your internet connection entirely and you have to reboot the drive and, many times, your router and modem. And then you don't This thing is a very expensive doorstop."
1,"No 64bit drivers, misleading speed, incomplete setup instructions","At 3-5 MB/sec, this drive's speed is embarassingly slow and more appropriate for a USB 1.1. device rather than a 1 Gb device. The package includes no 64 bit version of the software and WD does not intend to release a 64 bit version. While it is possible to connect to the drive through the SMB protocol, the manual fails to mention the device's default name. I was finally able to connect by checking my router's DHCP entries."
1,I Should Have Known...,"Messed with this drive for a week trying to get it to work properly over wireless 'N' with XP and MacOS machines. All machines could read but writing was an issue for one of the XP boxes for some reason. Loaded up 50GB then the drive quit.Bottom Line:- Little or no documentation - you gotta' rely on forums;- It's very slow over wireless;- Would 'quit' in the middle of large write jobs - over 1GB;- I'm stuck with it after the failure (WD will send me a replacement)- As mentioned, whatever you do, don't install MioNet"
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!,"Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of junk. It would not let you install the software without internet connection. It would not even work without internet connection even if you are trying to connect it from a computer from the local area network. Not only that, it make my internet connection very unstable. I had to write this review the second time because I still have this hard drive connected to my network. I am removing the data currently to return it. It is very very very slow. Don't trust the advertise 500MB/s it is like .005MB/s . I think they put the zeros on the wrong side of the 5. Just kidding, I think it is like 2MB/s. Still imagine trying to transfer 500GB with that speed. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
1,Lousy remote storage/access,"This roduct sounded to good to actually work as claimed, & sure enough it falls very short. When hooked up through the network (which is required for anywhere access) the included software doesn't work that great. It's pretty slow & not always reachable even on the local network. It's poor performance really shows when you're trying to access from outside.Very big disappointment."
4,Fasco motor for bathroom infrared light and fan.,"We have a bathroom infrared light with two fans: a slow-speed fan tied in parallel to the infrared lights and a high-speedexhaust fan. When the slow-speed fan died, I bought the Fasco wall heater fan to a replacement. It works fine asa slow-speed fan."
4,does anyone know anything about the book 100 magic miles?,can you please tell me what this book is about?
2,50%,"I bought two batteries at about half the price of a Panasonic, Lumix brand. One of them works fine. The other was dead on delivery."
2,"I confused this with ""The Positronic Man""","I was disappointed because this is the collection of short stories containing The Bicentenial Man. I got it confused with The Positronic Man, which is the full length novel of the same storyThe seller was fine, but it was frustrating that I got this for someone as a gift and it wasn't what I meant to give them."
3,Profound philosophical discussions,"I read this recently, two decades after a ploughed through some if Asimov's other works as a teenager, and I suddenly understood the breadth and depth of this man's intellect.Concise but never lecturing, and subtly but remarkably progressive in aspects of gender- and race-related questions, Asimov takes the reader right to the red thread that underpins all his stories: What does it mean to be human in a situation where the border between man and machine is blurred?The writing in itself is hugely compentent but lacks atmosphere (which is the main thing I look for), which in my view makes the reading more of an exercise in thought experiments than moments of escapism.That said, the intellectual power at work here is undeniable, and I reckon future readers of Asimov will return: it is possible that his visions, outlandish at the time of their conception, will become quite relevant and urgent."
4,These sandals are so cute & comfortable,"These sandals are cute and they're cushy so you don't feel like you're walking on cement all day. The brand has so many designs available, I have a hard time choosing! I'd give them five stars if someone could figure out how to make them not rip! They come with little patches so the rips can be covered easily."
2,"The Proof that Parenting Is an Art, not a Science","This book explains very well the growing paranoia of modern parents. This is a resolute attack against parenting determinism. It is regrettable, however, that the author's references are not more ""scientific"" than those he reproaches to parenting determinism advocates of using. Moreover, he is not far from praising spanking, which is ""proven"" very bad for children."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I bought this book expecting something new but was disappointed. It does give some usefull info on psychic protection, etc but is rather disorganized. Not recommended for a beginning practioner as to much is left out. Most concerning was the large amount of focus on fighting imaginary opponents in other proposed realms of existence. I couldnt help but wonder if the author has been dabling a bit too much in unconscious fantasies."
5,"urbane, sophisticated scent","If memory serves, noted designer Giorgio Armani was once quoted as saying that his designs were created not to be noticed but rather to be remembered. A wonderful thought, typifying his always elegant, classic style. It's certainly true of his latest fragrance for men - Black Code.This is a subtle, sensual scent with a touch of the oriental found in notes of lemon and bergamot. It's an ultra masculine fragrance, difficult to capture yet impossible to ignore.True to Armani's vision, the glass bottle is artfully crafted - a cylinder of the deepest blue. It's gift boxed in the same color with printing in gray and white. Available in 1.7 and 2.5 oz. sprays, Black code is sure to take its place by the side of Armani's always popular Gio and Mania."
3,Ebony and ivory.,Two competent blues/rock players having a bit of self indulgent fun whats the harm in that?
2,"A good book, but...","For those who read 'Earth Hive', this book seemed a must get. After I read it, there was one thing that was apparent. There weren't enough Aliens! The book only got good on the last 30 pages. Get this book to complete the three-book series, that's it!"
1,"Hmmm, let's just forget about this one.","Aliens was my favourite movie of the quadtrology, therefore reading 'Earth Hive' gave me great expectations for this series. Unfortunatly Nightmare Asylum doesn't live up those expectations. There just isn't enough adventure to hold this story together. I recommend watching Alien 3 before reading this book."
