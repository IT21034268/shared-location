4,"Great suction, brush could be better","This vacuum has excellent suction, but the brush doesn't agitate the carpet as much as I would like. I would recommend this product, but warn people about the brush."
3,Dusty,"While I give the Vacuum high marks for it's compact size and powerful suction it's filter is by no means a good filter. We have a large stairwell and this thing is great; powerful, light, very easy to use. Yet every time we vacuum it creates a dusting nightmare."
4,Great Little Vac!,"I bought this vacuum to clean up around my cat's litter box and to clean my carpeted stairs. I wound up cleaning my chairs and sofa, too, the first time I used it. It works really well on all of those places. It's a bit heavy but not so much that I can't use it for all I need. It feels well made. The brush really picks up the fur and the built-in hose gives a lot of flexibility. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
5,Great product!,"I purchased this vacuum based on prior reviews and recommendations. I was totally amazed at what it picked up on my stairs.I'm very satisfied. Yes it is loud, but it does the job!"
5,THIS VACUUM REALLY SUCKS.,"I bought this vacuum for my dorm room, and I couldn't be more satisfied. It's easy to store and gets the job done. So convenient, I love using it. Picks up hair, dust, crumbs, etc. from all surfaces. I haven't noticed it being too loud like other reviews state- but it is a powerful little vacuum!"
4,Good all purpose handheld corded vacuum,"I purchased this vacuum mainly for stairs. I also use it around the baseboard and other small areas. It has very good power and easily vacuums the stair riser by adjusting the front attachment. The hose is very short so it is does have some reach limitations. Overall, a very good product for the price."
5,Worth twice the price A+,"Why didn't I buy this earlier to clean under furniture and clean my stairs? It's fabulous. It's cute, easy to empty, holds plenty, has three speeds, one with brush, it sucks powerfully, isn't too loud. Perfect for doing stairs. Cord is plenty long enough to plug in at foot of stairs and go all the way up. Unless cordless doesn't lose power or need charging. Words cannot describe how much I love this thing."
5,THE BEST ...Getting aanother for the RV,"THIS HAND VACUUM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!We are amazed as to what this little vacuum can do, like it so well that another is being ordered just for the RV. It is indeed very powerful, easily picking up dust, dirt, pet hair, etc. One reviewer indicated of it being very loud, however, I DO NOT find this true ...no more than what one would expect for its top performance."
5,Love this vac,"This is the best hand vac I've ever used. Nice long cord keeps the power going. Trust me, those cordless ones do not have enough power to vac home staircase. Suction is great and the hose with hand tool has come in handy. Dust cup is easy to empty and reattach. The rise up visor really makes cleaning fully carpeted stairs much easier. I researched before purchasing and this vac is everthing it claims to be. Amazon had the best price on it. Looking for a hand vac, get this one, you won't be disappointed."
5,I love this vacuum!,"This vacuum alone has made me a Eureka customer for life. It works great, is super powerful, and is light enough to not get tired of carrying it around. I will never buy any other type of hand-vac."
5,Amazed how much this vaccum picked up.,"After reading everyone else's review, I got this vaccum for Christmas. I am totally amazed at the amount of stuff this thing picks up. I vaccumed the cat litter box area, and I had no idea how much ground in cat hair and dust this thing picked up. It does get a bit heavy especially if you go crazy and start vaccuming everything in sight. Actually, the only reason I stopped was because my arm was tired. I did have to empty the dust cup a few times and brushed it off with a brush. So far, the suction has remained the same. But, I do plan on buying an extra dustcup or 2 just in case, (I heard they are relatively cheap on the eureka.com site.)I was able to attach a hose from a different vaccum and was able to leave it in 1 place and vaccum around it using different attachments. This will be really handy when my arm has recovered enough to do the car.This vaccum is definitely worth every penny."
4,Like it but it's heavy,I really like this item because the cord is long enough to clean a large space without having to keep plugging and unplugging. It is also powerful. The only this that makes it tough is the weight. I'm a little woman and my arms get very tired - I just have to consider it my workout for the day!
3,Good Little Vacuum,"I had read that this would be heavy, but I do not find that to be true. Works great, but the dirt cup does fill up rather quickly. Course that may just be that I have a lot of dirt!! I'm not too fond of the material the brushes are made of, but they work good. The fact that hose and attachment are right on board make it very easy to switch from brush to hose. Previously had Dirt Devil hand vacs, and while they work good, always seem to be replacing the material bags on outside."
4,Good could be better,The power is awesome for the small size. needs better cord management like a self-contained wrap up. Light weight and nice options.
4,"Used in workplace in Afghanistan, dust blows everywhere","This is a great handheld vac, but it doesn't handle fine dust particles well. The ""sand"" in afghanistan is more like moon dust, and when I used it to vacuum, the dust went straight through the filter and just made life more miserable. I'd recommend this for normal household use in the good old USofA"
4,Best for the price,"My wife and I looked for a powerful small vacuum for our small apartment. We did not want a cordless vac because the suction power is usually sub-par and the battery always seems to deteriorate. This vacuum really fits the bill being small, powerful, and corded. Our only complaint is that there isn't really any great way to clean the filter (without replacing it) so it gets pretty filthy. All in all we are very pleased with it."
5,Meets expectations,"I have had this vacuum a few weeks and it has performed as well as I expected. We use it to vacuum the stairs, vacuum pet hair from the furniture and clean the cars. So far, it has performed extremely well. My kids have fun using it to vacuum up messes as well. Very handy!"
1,Piece of Junk,"You'd think from the reviews this would be a no-brainer, but you'd be wrong, Shortly after I started using it the filter on the inside clogged reducing the suction by half. I couldn't use it to even pick up popcorn kernels I spilled.Also, the unit is heavy and loud."
2,Inadequate,"We got this primarily for use in our cars. Electrical access is close, so we did not need a battery or 12V unit, and we thought this would have more power. However, it does not draw as good as our cheap (and old) tiny wet/dry vacuum from Harbor Freight. It's a little clunky, and it takes me twice as long to effectively vacuum the cars as it did before."
4,Works just fine!,"The only warning I have is that Amazon recommend the customer to also consider buying a ""TomTom ONE XL / XLs Car Charger."" Sounds wonderful. Plug into the car. ... The Vacuum has NO way to plug in the TomTom ONE XL / XLs Car Charger!!!! OOOPS! Wasted $5."
5,Eureka 71A hand held vacuum,This is by far the best hand held vacuum that I have ever had. I needed to find something that would not blow out bug dust from a bag and still have a lot of suction power. This little vac is amazing. We have a lot of beetles...and when you vacuum them up they emit a terrible odor. This vacuum has a dust cup that can be emptied quickly. A brush easily cleans up carpet on steps...and the crevice tool is right on the vac and the cord wraps and it goes from brush vacuum to crevice vacuum with the push of a button. Not heavy so it's easy to use. Definitely a five star product.
1,SECON VACUUM IN A YEAR,"This Vacuum is not good. I only used for cleaning my stairs (I do not have pets) and the vacuum stopped working after a while.New works perfect!, but after some uses stars decreasing suction until no more suction at all. For my has been a waste of money. Very unhappy with this vacuum."
2,Sad,"I would have given this vacc 5*, but unfortunately the crevice tool mas missing when arrived.The problem is that I took it back to Mexico City where I reside and returning it would be expensive.So I'm stuck with an incomplete appliance."
2,worked well for a bit,"It worked pretty well for a little bit, but as soon as I start vacuuming up more a little bit more stuff, it all gets clogged in the tube going into the canister and basically stops working. I'm defiantly getting an upright vacuum now. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone with a place more than 800sq feet unless you want to break your back cleaning."
3,Good machine BUT WARNING - Can't Change Belt,"This machine has good power, but imagine my surprise when there was no instructions for changing the belt. Upon emailing the company I was told that you should take the machine to an authorized service center because it's too complex to do at home. If that's the case, why do they sell belts as an optional companion order?Very frustrating."
4,Nifty little vaccuum,"Bought this for pet hair. Works great on upholstery and around the edges of area rugs (where traditional vaccuums have trouble getting a good suction). Love the small size and the attached hose and crevice tool. Picked up a surprising amount of cat hair that wasn't necessarily visible. It is a wee bit heavy, but will give me a nice way to capture cathair tumbleweeds in between regular vaccuuming."
4,"On the whole, very good",On the whole this vacuum works very well. It picks up pet hair nicely (we have 5 cats). The filter system could be improved tho. It is a bit hard to clean....one needs to get in there and touch all the hair in order to remove the hair.
4,Great vacuum for the price,"I bought this vacuum based on reviews because I have 2 cats (one long haired, one short) and 2 dogs (Labrador and French Bulldog) and a fabric covered couch. Getting the hair off of this thing is a NIGHTMARE! I also have a bed spread that needs vacuuming daily because all the animals sleep on it. This little vacuum does the trick. It takes a few passes on both the couch and the bed spread in order to get all the hair, but considering the level of difficulty I've had with getting the hair up, I'll gladly take a few passes!! My only complaint is that the vacuum IS a bit heavy, and loud, but it works great. I'm happy I purchased it."
5,Fantastic Hand-held vacuum,"This is a great hand-held vacuum. I bought this specifically for our stairs. We have 2 cats, 1 dog, and 3 kids going up an down the stairs and this vacuum cleaned the stairs in one pass. It did an amazing job on the fine fuzzy cat hair. I highly recommend this vacuum."
5,Exactly What I needed!!!,"I have had this vacuum for about a month and I am in love!!! I was looking for a vacuum that could be used on the furniture, but had the power of an upright. This vacuum is the perfect solution! The rotating brushes pick up dog hair off of a suede couch and sheets. The hose that is attached comes in handy when trying to get into the corners of the house and is perfect for the crevices of the couch. I recommend this vacuum to everyone I know, especially those with dogs!"
5,great vacuum for the car,I got his vac primarily to clean my car. When this first arrived my car was really dirty (i had just moved). This vac lifted all the dirt from the carpet and my car was super clean. Recommend this to any one who is looking for a car vac.
2,Powerful but one big flaw,"Would be a great little vac but the ""innovative"" riser visor is also a piece of thin plastic placed exactly where the vacuum will hit walls, furniture, etc. It lasted about a year and suction is greatly reduced without it. It's also not available as a replacement part. So I guess I have to buy a new vacuum - very convenient if you sell vacuums, not so convenient for me."
3,"Great, except ..","Quiet, plenty of power for a little guy but - I don't know why the bend in the hose just before the debris enters the body is not detachable. This vacuum clogs at the bend very easily and is very difficult to clean out when this happens. If they would simply make the area where the hose attaches to the body of the vacuum so (frequent) clogs can be cleared without 40 minutes of work it would be perfect. In the meantime, sweep floors to remove any actual dirt, fur, grass, cereal, little pieces of paper .. anything larger than dust first."
5,Great for stairs and dog hair,"This vacuum is great i have two dogs, it picks up the dog hair on the stairs and the attachment gets the edges and crevices. The weight is not an issue if you push it along slowly, you will get fantastic results!"
5,Love this little thing,"I bought it for my stairs, but it's come in super handy for the cars and for furniture, as well quick messes and tight spaces. It's easier to drag out than the big vacuum, and it's light and has great suction. The tools are perfect and the flipping circulating brush cover that I never thought I'd use gets used often. The cannister is easy to pop off to empty, and the 'replaceable' filter in there is sturdy and I just brush it off everytime I empty the cannister. I don't forsee having to replace the filter for a very long time. It looks and feels very durable."
4,Excellent for pet hair in car,"If you've ever tried to vacuum up pet hair in your car, you can understand how frustrating it can be... The Eureka 71B does an excellent job of picking up pet hair (and other debris) from your carpet/upholstry. The hand-held tool is also excellent in crevices. I read (in a different review) to place a tissue over the filter cup in order to mimize ""mess"" and it worked very well. I highly reccomend this product!"
4,no more cat hair,The best vaccuum for animal hair I've tried. A little heavy for a small person to wield but the results are worth the effort. The rotating brush makes all the difference and it has a lot of power. Highly recommend it...
5,Eureka 71A Hand-Held Vacuum,"I Love it! Wish the hose was a little longer but it does the job especially the stairs. very light and much better than the ones that charge on the walls. the electrical plug is very long, so you can get around very easily. great for windowsills. good product. powerful"
2,Worked great...twice,"I was very impressed with this vacuum the first two times I used it. The suction was very powerful and easily picked up pet hair from my car. Initially, my only complaint was that its a little wide to use as a car vac but it still manages. The third time I plugged it in and turned it on and the motor sounded all high pitched and made a whizzing sound, the suction was drastically reduced. I checked the filter to make sure nothing was clogging it but didn't see anything. It still works but just not very well."
4,Great for pet hair.,"Someone said that this hand held didn't have an air blowing vent on the back which blows pet air around. This isn't true, but for pet hair this little guy kicks some butt! I didn't buy it to do anything but get pet hair off the couch and out of my office so I can't comment for anything else. I am happy with it. Hope that helps."
2,Can't stand it,"I wanted to like this vacuum since there are so many good reviews, but I've given it 6 months and am throwing it away. The brush suction is good, which would be the main thing you look for, but to me that's overshadowed by the negatives: 1) the cup falls off easily and doesn't sit flush in its spot 2) the filter is hard to clean 3) the cord doesn't stay wrapped 4) there isn't good suction from the hose. It is heavy and doesn't get into small areas but I would even live with that if it weren't for the cup, filter, cord and lack of hose suction."
2,Not the product for me,I bought this product to vacuum my stairs in my 2-level townhouse apartment. I have cats and the dust cup is too small and would have to be emptied several times in one job.
5,Great little vacuum,"This little unit surpassed our expectations. It will replace and old Dirt Devil that has seen better days. The Eureka hand held's motor is almost as powerful as our large Dyson. Stair riser flip window is a great addition. The unit will pull triple duty as a home vacuum, a travel trailer unit, and as a boat carpet vacuum."
4,does the job,"its heavier than i thought and the handle is very uncomfortable to hold. very hard plastic. However, it does a good job."
3,Too heavy,"I was hoping this would take the place of my regular large upright because I don't have too much carpet to clean. However, I returned it after a few days because it was just way too heavy to use as a handheld when cleaning a large rug. It was also ungainly and didn't feel balanced in my hand. It had nice suction though, but the negatives outweighed that positive."
4,GOOD FOR TODDLER'S MESS!!!,"Once I bought this I am able to keep my kid's feeding area clean after every meal easily. The bad thing about the vacuum is that the filter can't get wet and I vacuum everything and some fruits got the filter wet some how and a bad smell started coming out of it, hope I can fix this soon. Excellent to clean small areas!!!"
3,An ok handheld - but could be better,"I got this handheld vacuum to pick up those small spills and get to hard to reach placed where you don't need or can't get your big vacuum to go. It is pretty heavy and has decent suction, but it fills up really fast and it is a bit of pain to clean the filter. Also note that it is not as compact as you may think it to be and actually takes up a decent amount of storage space for a handheld vac. Overall, not bad, but not great either. One thing is for sure, with its bright yellow color, you'll never lose it!"
1,Suction Good - Brush Is Worthless,"The suction on this device is good, but the brush is worthless. For a device that touts being able to use the brush horizontally and vertically, you would think that it would have a stronger motor. The slightest amount of pressure will stop the brush from spinning. I am definitely returning this."
5,Definitely recommended for pet owners,"I have two cats and one dog--all prolific shedders--and I've been in search of the perfect vacuum. I still haven't found it but I've had the Eureka hand-held vacuum for a couple of weeks now and am beginning to think that the perfect vacuum will actually be two--a combination of a good upright plus this Eureka. It really does have the power of an upright in a hand-held. I need to vacuum my couches, dining chairs and stairs at least a couple of times a week and am loving this vacuum for this. It sucks up the pet hair at least as well as my Dyson, if not better; and it is much easier to use than the attachments on my upright. Yes, it is a little heavy and loud, but I don't find either of these to be significant drawbacks."
2,Cleans GREAT!,"This sweeper cleans fantastic..But the handle is to thick and is awkward for me to use, my wife hates it because she is petite and cannot get a grip on the handle. The sweeper is way to cumbersome to use. They need to not keep trying to make it the all in one tool and make a light weight sweeper as some have done on earlier models. It needs to looses weight, depth and width."
3,It's OK,"This vacuum is difficult to use on the stairs on my deep pile carpet. It's OK, just nothing to write home to mother about."
2,It's not cordless,I made the foolish assumption that this handheld vacuum is cordless but it needs to be plugged in while operating so I am returning.
5,Amazing Little F*****,"This is my first review on Amazon, but I've ordered a lot of stuff, this machine has far surpassed my expectations, so I had to post something. This vacuum works really well. The brush tool, especially works well on the cats hair everywhere.Additionally, it's tiny, well-designed and very light.Highly recommended."
1,No product manual included,"Bought on Amazon. No product manual included. Looked like a photocopy was sneaked in and switched in its place. I would be okay with a photocopy, but the photocopy was missing many pages. Not cool."
4,wroks fine for us.,No issues so far. we used it for floors and stairsteps.I heard some complaints from otheres. But it works fine for us
1,Looks great for the price but was a waste of money.....,I was glad to see most of the reviews for this product were fairly good and for the price it almost seems too good to be true.... sadly it was too good to be true. The vacuum is small and light weight and very handy to have for the car and cleaning up pet hair. The first time i used it l couldn't have been happier however it worked once then the roller decided not to work after that. Suction started getting weaker and weaker. By the 3rd time of using the vacuum it failed to pick up anything and it now makes a nasty burning smell when i turn it on. i have tried cleaning out the pipe and the brush but nothing helps. l had high hopes but it was a Big disappointment. Save yourself 40 bucks and put it towards a decent vacuum is my advice.
5,Powerful little vacuum!,Highly recommend this little machine. The suction is fantastic and it picks up all kinds of dirt that my other vacuum misses.
3,Kinda hard to use,I bought this as a quick little dust buster for cat litter messes and such but it's kind of awkward to use and the attachments aren't the best either. Might be good to use in my car.
3,Expectations,"Although this is a nice little vacuum, it didn't quite meet my expectations. It doesn't have the power I was hoping for vacuuming my carpeted stairway. It is a plug-in vacuum, and I hoped that would mean more power."
4,Good little vacuum,"Item arrived as scheduled and I would purchase from seller again. Great little vacuum, it is a bit on the heavy side but does a really great job on pet hair."
2,Worked...,"Worked ok for awhile, now it doesn't work very well even after changing the filter. Plus, the electrical plug end does not stay attached to the cord, so the cord always unravels. Drives me crazy."
3,Fine dust will clog on/off switch,"This vacuum works well. The only problems with it are the hose is short and thus you end up struggling to keep the exhaust from blowing away what you are trying to suck up with the hose. I am on my second unit. The first one had the on and off switch fail after 3 months. I was able to take the unit apart and get it cleaned out from all of the dirt, but it never worked as well as when it was new. It is too bad they designed the switch to be exposed to the dust.All of that said, I cannot find a unit that would work better for my application. So again, this is my second unit."
5,"Great suction, not heavy!","I bought this after doing a considerable amount of research on the net. Am I glad!Perfect for the stairs and 'hard to reach' corners in the car. I also use it to pick hair and food crumbs off the couch. Works like a charm. I especially love the super stretchy hose and how the dust container never seems to fill up. I don't find it heavy. Maybe it's relative, because it's unlikely they sent me a lighter piece. Great buy, highly recommended."
4,Great little handheld,"I've been searching for a handheld vacuum for months now. I have two dogs and suede couches but I also have wood floors so I have no need for a regular upright. This little thing is perfect. It's a plug-in so it has all the same power of a handheld but it's light and easy to hold. The brush is perfect for picking up dog hair but you can also turn the brush rotation off and just spot vac too. My only complaint is that I wish it had a retractable cord. Other than that, it's perfect."
3,Eureka hand held vac,A nice compact vacuum that has plenty of power to clean deeply on furniture and deep carpet. Hose and attachments are handy and easy to use.
5,great hand vac!,"My husband and I have tried a couple of different handheld vacs but have never really been that satisfied. We have cats that like to nap on our couch and leave a LOT of hair! This little vacuum is very powerful and does a great job of picking up the cat hair. It does much better than any of the battery powered ones, so even though it is not cordless, we believe it is worth the trade off. It is a little bit heavier than our other battery-powered ones, but again, for the power, is worth the trade off for us. We do not have carpeted stairs so I cannot say anything about that particular functionality but we are very happy with this purchase and I'm glad I listened to all of the past reviews."
3,Can I return it?,"It's heavy & awkward. The filter fills up almost immediately,making it useless unless you're prepared to clean it out.Replacing filters everytime it gets dirty would be mega $$ soit's not hastle free, especially with the cord.It's small & powerful. The hose feature is great butthe attachment has no storage on the vacuum,so you have to carry it in your pocket while not using it.Hmmmmmmm.... Not so good.When you buy on amazon, how do you return it? Need to checkinto that."
3,Ergonomic like a brick,"This machine seems to generally do well at picking up the cat hair that accumulates on my stairs. The cord is long enough to reach all the way up my stairway, and the cost seemed decent for a vacuum that has a motor-driven brush and a hose/crevice tool.My only complaint is that I find holding the unit rather uncomfortable. Perhaps my hands are too big (or too small?) for the handle, but it feels like trying to keep a firm hold on a brick. It wouldn't be too bad except that it's not light either, and the combination makes doing several stairs feel like a big chore."
4,A man's Vac,This is probably the best handheld vac on the market.It is great for an RV and vehiclesI now own three and use them everywhereOnly problem ever is the switch whichgets sticking and needs cleaning.That's why not a perfect score.
2,Great vacuum - until it burns out (about a year),"This worked great. A little heavy but good suction. However, our first burnt out at 11 months. Thankfully, we live near a service center and they replaced it with a brand new unit. The second lasted perhaps nearly two years.It wasn't used that much and I expect better. My floor vacuum is 9 years old and running, my Mighty Mite (which I don't use much at all) might be 20 years old."
4,eureka hand held vacuum,good on stairs. picks up dog hair. I like the hose for cleaning the edges where the dog hair tends to collect. It would be nice if someone would design a vacuum that does what this one does but with a long handle so people would not have to get on their knees to do stairs
4,Neat little vacuum,"This is a neat, little vacuum (pun intended).+ Long power cable (for its intended use, like in a single room)+ Pretty easy cleanup+ Brushless-mode + hose for those hard to reach places- Power is a little lacking, but you get what you pay for"
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros are that it has great suction, isn't very noisy, sweeps great. Cons are that it's heavy and I don't like the handle, so I'm returning it. They should round off the grip handle. I actually had marks on my palms from using it and it was very uncomfortable and hurt my hands while sweeping. Maybe because I'm a woman and have smaller hands, but it would be much nicer with a rounded off handle like the Dirt Devil, which is what I used to have. I just didn't buy one because of the bad reviews, but I will be buying one because I just can't use this."
4,okay if you don't have that many animals,I read ALL of the reviews on how great this is for pet hair. I have 16 cats and to get the cat hair off of the furniture I need to go over the couches about 10 times with the vacuum. It's perfect if you only have a couple of animals - but if you have more than 5 then it gets a bit harder. What I've been doing is using a lint brush first then go over everything wearing rubber gloves and this way the cat hair sticks to the gloves. FINALLY I go over everything with the vacuum and it makes it MUCH easier. I know it's alot of work and it has to be done on a daily basis but it's better than sitting in cat hair. :)
4,A handy little hand vac,This is a very handy little hand vac. Nice suction and can be used easily with small attachments used for cleaning electronics. It gets into small places wonderfully. Great for cleaning crevices and corners and cobwebs. Just wish the hose was a little longer. The electric cord is nice and long.
4,Good Buy,Cleans very effectively. Powerful suction. It's hard to keep the wound-up cord from falling off of the cleaner. The hose for the wand is too short for the wand to be used conveniently -- I would have preferred having the wand and a longer hose not attached to the cleaner.
1,Seems good at first - doesn't last!!!!!!,"********BROKE AFTER 3 MONTHS. Doesn't suck anything any longer and it's NOT the filter. High rating is likely people not returning to say how their vacuum broke! Wait, can I give it less stars??! ******** Perfect thus far but...if I could add anything, it'd be an internal cord holder, and some telescoping handle so i wouldn't have to hunch over (because this lil thing is actually stronger than our larger vacuum and I'd prefer to just use it!). not too heavy. powerful. sucks my fluffy dog's hair off everything. assuming the only part i wont enjoy is cleaning out the filter. this is probably the only hand-held vacuum i've used that really works!"
1,"All the dust that is vacuumed in, gets out at the back","I can not return this vacuum because I live abroad, and it would be more expensive to return it. But every time we try to vacuum, all the dust that comes in, gets out at the back. We changed the filter for a new one, and it was the same, all the room turns out full of dust.Can you explain to me how can I do to avoid this? or is that the design does not work at all?? Thank you."
5,Outstanding performance,"Just got done vacuuming the stairs with this purchase and I have to admit I was absolutely floored by its performance! Bought it primarily to deal with the cat hair on the stairs and it performed absolutely wonderfully. I was a little concerned about the comments about its weight but at approx 5 lbs it really isn't an issue unless you have a lot of stairs to cover. I like the fact that you can turn off the brush roller and just have the vacuum going. Filter cleaning is easy, and the filter itself seems pretty solidly constructed.For $39 it's absolutely worth every penny."
4,Great for pet hair,"Great little vacuum. Picks up dog and cat hair on any surface with no problem. I use it on the couch, small rugs, dog bed, and car. Only issue I have is the weight. You must have some arm strength to move it back and forth."
5,Serious power,"This little unit has a lot more power than I expected from a hand-held vac. It's great for stairs but also very handy for spot cleaning, either with the powered brush or just with the hose and crevice tool.When I first unpacked it, I tried it out on what I thought was clean carpet. I was shocked to see all the crud it picked up!"
1,Broke after 4-5 uses,"Bought this and thought it worked great until it, like other reviewers said, went out in a puff of black and very stinky smoke. I don't recommend this product. Overheats and dies pretty quickly..."
3,Nobody's mentioned emptying the thing!,"Yes, I agree with the other reviewers about convenience and suction power. I chose it because I have had good success with Eureka products over the years, although I currently have a Dyson Animal (great action) and Bissell (v. inexpensive) uprights with almost equal efficacy. I figured a corded model would do better than a battery one for power and duration. However, the BIG negative for me is the nuisance of emptying the cup. Emptying HAS to be done outside, using a brush (not provided) to clean off the filter -- not very healthy inhaling that stuff, for sure. If you have a pet (we have a kittycat) it only takes a very few minute of vacuuming to clog the filter. Y'all let me know when Mr. Dyson has solved the battery life of his handheld! I think we're all waiting for a 5-star hand vac!!"
1,Not a great Vacuum,"This Vacuum would be great if it didn't shut down every 5 minutes! I called Eureka and they told me that it was just overheated and give it a few minutes then try again. Well, who has time to vacuum in 5 minute intervals?? I'm contacting Amazon to return mine. p.s. they wouldn't let me give a rating of 0 stars, so I had to give it a 1!"
1,Machine broke as soon as the warranty expired :-(,"Very powerful little handheld, great for stairs and hard to reach spots. Clearly would be a 5 star itemEXCEPT...We only used the thing every few months on our stairs and a couple other tight spots. Couldn't have had more than an hour or two of run time on the machine. The first time we used it after the end of the one year warranty, the motor let out all it's black smoke. It even left a stain on the carpet. I really expect products to last a bit longer than their warranty."
5,Awesome handheld but could use a few improvements,"This thing works like a dream. It was everything I expected (amazon reviews) and more! Truly is remarkably powerful for a handheld, which is probably why it's heavier than any other handheld vacuum I've used. The shape of the tip is a bit odd though. The wide opening suggests that I use it as a traditional vacuum, but that really isn't realistic. Can you imagine anyone cleaning their entire house with this little vacuum down on all fours? The hose attachment solves this problem and though it is very easy and quick to assemble and disassemble, I'd prefer a smaller mouth in addition to the hose attachment. Also I didn't realize that it was not a cordless handheld. Though the cord is nice because it's long. Overall, the quality of this van trumps all of my dislikes about this vac. I'll probably end up buying one for both floors of my home."
5,Love this!,"I LOVE this hand-vac!! We have 2 dogs with wiry hair so getting dog hair out of our sofas is quite tricky. This hand-vac does a superb job of picking it all up. I was shocked the first time I used it at how well it worked. The little hose comes in handy also, and I really like how you can adjust the front piece so it's easier to clean hard-to-get places."
5,I love it!,"We have a lady bug issue in our 100-year-old house, and I bought this vacuum to easily move from room to room to sweep the little critters out of our windows. However, I have found that I use it constantly! It has great suction, and is so much easier to use on stairs, vacuuming close to baseboards (where my other vacuum seems to miss), and vacuuming our cars. I use attachments from my large vacuum to reach places where the attached hose doesn't quite reach. I've had this small vacuum for about 2 years now and it is still going strong...however, if it does break, I'll be buying a new one without hesitation. I really don't know what I would do without it!"
5,Eureka! great hand held vacuum,"Great for cleaning cars, trucks, stairs, little clean ups.Twenty foot power cord means you can use without an extension cord."
5,Great Product,"Eureka 71B Hand-held vacuum works very well, especially on pet hair. You do have to keep the roller brush and filters clean, but not a problem. An old toothbrush is helpful cleaning the filter. When winding the cord (which is a long cord), slip the plug between the last loop to secure the cord from falling apart when you pick up vacuum. I thought it was a well engineered product.Tom"
5,Paul from Cleveland,"After reading the other reviews I decided to order the Eureka 71b. The most powerful hand vacuum I ever used. The brush is alittle wider than other mfg's and more powerful. I also like the elbow coming out swivels, this allows the hose to be usein front or behind the vacuum - keeping the exhaust from blowing the dirt around. It's built like a portable powered hand tool, very rugged. That being said it's slightly heavier than the other models I've owned. The dirt canister is small, I usually empty after using, I use another vacuum to clean the filter after emptying out. There's a place to wrap the cord up on the aft end. I feel it's the best hand vacuum on the market right now. I would recommend this to a friend."
1,Brush motor lasted for only 27 months,"I purchased this vacuum in late June 2010. Today the brush stopped spinning due to brush motor failure. I confirmed that the belt was not the issue after I took the vac apart. The belt lasted longer than the motor; how do you like that? I used the vac once per week in a small (960+/- sq ft) carpeted condo. Each weekly use was for no longer than 15 minutes. I will contact Eureka tomorrow and complain. What a disappointment, not to mention this 7 pound yellow plastic brick entering the waste stream."
3,Loud and heavy,"Meech. I wanted to replace an old handheld vac and the reviews for this were impressive. I'm less than thrilled because this baby is a bit heavy and scares the cat. The strong exhaust pushes dirt away, but I can learn to manage this issue."
1,Motor burned out after 2 uses,"I got this vacuum on Nov 19, 2008 and used it 2 times, the third time something started smelling really strong and bad (burned plastic and rubber) and although it still sort of works, the motor seems to be melting away. I just missed my return deadline (Jan 31) from amazon by 9 days so I can't return it. However, Amazon offered me a replacement. I hope this one works as I am not impressed with the longevity of the previous one. I will be sure to use it a lot more to test it now."
3,Only one drawback,"I was really impressed when I first used this hand-held vacuum. It is extremely powerful, picking up dirt and pet hair, working like a charm.I have only one complaint, and I think it's a big one: the brushes are very hard to clean once hair got tangled in them. Thus after a while, it could not pick up as much hair as it used to. Maybe the reason is that I used it on carpet. Perhaps it is not designed to handle such heavy work. After all, it's hand-held.But overall it's a great buy"
4,"Great suction, but could be lighter","Its amazing how much dirt this little baby sucked off our couch and upholstry. The ability to make the suction head vertical is quite helpful. The vaccum cleaner is a bit on the heavy side though - if it had been a little lighter, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,OMG! I LOVE!,"The best lightweight vacuum I've ever had. Within 5 minutes of using the vacuum for the first time, it was already picking up so much dirt and hair. What I love most about this is that it cleans like a large vacuum but it doesn't heat up the room like most of my larger ones do. It's great for small areas of carpets, such as bedrooms, closets, or stairs. I would absolutely recommend this.pros: strong suction for hair and dirt, does not become hot after long period of use, long plug for outlet, portable, takes little spacecons: a bit heavy if carried around for a long time (but nothing unbearable)"
1,is now in the trash,"So where do i begin?? This thing has never worked that good, even right out of the box. I have probably only used it a dozen time, when it just DIED!!! For getting such stellar reviews I am VERY disappointed!! It never sucked good, barely collected any debris, and now it doesnt do anything. The attachment worked better than the main roller thing,and that is not saying much. Wish I could return it, what a waste of money!!I know as a reader, it is hard to know what to believe. But as far as my Eureka was concerned it was a piece of junk. That will now be sitting in the local dump."
3,Not that pleased with this vaccum,"I should have written a review last June, but didn't get around to it. I have had this vacccum since last May (2010) and I have only used it 4 or 5 times. It's bulky, not that easy to use and lacks in suction. Plan to puchase something else in the near future and sell this is a garage sale."
4,Nice little appliance,"I should not complain the product, the problem was my careless, I planed to order an wireless handheld vacuum, but this one has wire. Other than that, everything is great, it is very powerful, eazy to clean the filter, eazy to catch the dirt, hair at corners."
2,This is for left-handed people,I just received this vacuum so I'm only speaking of the awkwardness of it and not how well it picks up. The crevice tool attaches on the left-hand side which seems backwards to me. I am right handed so I have to hold the vacuum with my right hand and work the crevice tool with my left hand. It should be the other way around. I'm sending it back for this reason.
2,It Could Be Better,"I have 2 medium-sized long haired dogs and I purchased the Eureka to use on a daily basis to clean up after them in my bedroom where they sleep at night. The vacuum does have really good suction when the dust cup is empty or nearly empty. The problem is that the dust cup is really small and doesn't hold very much. With 2 dogs to clean up after, it has to be emptied frequently in order to work well. In addition, the filter clogs easily and it's pretty messy to beat all the dust out of it (that has to be done outside). The plastic bristles on the roller really trap hair, so it's necessary to pull the hair strands off of them at least once a week. Lastly, the cord isn't very long and the plug pulls out of the wall socket easily. This is my first Eureka hand vac and it will be my last. Dirt Devil makes much better hand vacs for dealing with pet hair."
4,Works well but not for the car,"I bought this vacuum with the intention of using it to clean the car. As a vacuum it works very well, and is not as noisy as many claim. After all, it's a vacuum it has to make noise. It's easy to clean and works well. Though it's a bit on the heavy side for such a small vacuum.It does not work with the car. I attached a converter plug to use with the car, but it would not even start. I figured that it simply needs more power. So I attached the converted plug into 150w power inverter but it still refused to start. So you can't use it for the car, but it certainly works well if your intention is use at home."
3,"works for a while, then clogs--but can be unclogged if you know how","Wrote this first: I liked this small vacuum when I first got it, but it quickly began to fail. It clogs easily. I have to clean the filter--messy job--literally with each usage. After a few months, the machine appeared to have lost most of its suction. It leaves almost as much dirt as it picks up. The exhaust in the back is strong and seems to create a cloud of debris. I have simply given up and stopped using it. Waster of moneyThen a thoughtful commentator informed me that the hose can be removed and cleaned. Now the Vacuum works fine again. I upped my rating to 3 stars but not 5 because the manufacturer should have made this known"
3,Some serious noise here and lots of exhaust...,"I have ringing in my ears after I use this unit but the suction is really good and that's why I bought it over some battery models. You have to be careful where you point the exhaust port which is on the back of the unit. The hose with the unit is extremely short, 30 inches stretched and 16 otherwise. I was cleaning our pellet stove and lost operational containment when the exhaust port got pointed INTO the pellet stove. Ash was flying everywhere and I thought I could suck it back into the unit with the suction hose but kept pointing the rear end of the unit back into the stove. On this occasion I didn't notice the ringing in my ears as I staggered back from the stove blinded by the ash. Subsequent use of the unit has not been that dramatic. The filter cup is not stellar and the odor of ash or dog will pass through but the suction works well and traps all you would expect."
4,"A little heavy, but does the job well.","I have had this item for less than a week. Item functions as advertised. However, I was surprised at how heavy this is and it's a little bulky, too. Not lightweight like a Dustbuster but the reviews indicate it performs really well so I'll give it a shot. Will update if that changes. Be aware it is on the heavy and bulky side if that is a concern for you."
5,Great RV Vacuum,"I just bought this for my new travel trailer and it is excellent! NOT a rechargeable, which means it has LOTS of suction power. It has a 20 foot cord so I can plug it in midway in my unit and reach everywhere. The cord wraps around the base with a grip on the plug to lock it in. The hose is attached to the unit, and the straight nozzle stores in the base. It doesn't require a bag, but contrary to what I read in another review, Eureka DOESN'T recommend washing the filter with water. Only the cup around the filter is washable. Amazon does have an aftermarket filter replacement which is washable, I might have to check it out. All in all, I'm very satisfied."
3,Incredibly powerful,"Based on previous reviews, I thought this might be good for picking up cat hair, and it is. It's as powerful as any full-size vacuum. I like how it lets you keep the hose and electrical cord organized there right on the vacuum. Thought the Riser Visor was silly until I vacuumed my car--very helpful. And the Eureka's not cordless, so there won't be any problems with rechargeable batteries that get wimpier over time. Highly recommended.Update, 2011: After four years, the machine started sucking dust into the mechanism and then died. (I thought it was curious when no debris collected in the cup--that should've tipped me off.) I cleaned filter about every 2nd or 3rd use and didn't see any holes in filter...oh well. Bought another because I still like this model overall. Will try to clean filter more often."
5,I didn't know small vacuums could be so powerful.,"Don't have much to add to the legion of positive reviews. This thing is awesome. I had no idea that these handheld type vacuums could be powerful enough to replace a full size (for cleaning the car, for instance)."
5,Great little vacuum,This is a great portable vacuum. I have ownedseveral hand held vacuums and this one is by far the best. The rotating brush is great for picking up cat hair.
5,Powerful! Cleans Surfaces Other's Couldn't!,"I received the Eureka Easy Clean 71B as a gift from Amazon. I have 2 cats and a 14-month old, so crumbs and pet hair are prevalent, and this handheld works way better than my other handheld (an old Black & Decker rechargable Dust Buster) with picking up crumbs, and better than my regular vacuum's upholstery attachment with cleaning my furniture(again, a 6+ year old Bissel). The 71B picks up pet hair and crumbs from static-y surfaces that my other vacuums won't. It is also very powerful - it almost feels like it is about to suck the ceramic tiles off the kitchen floor! :) My only complaint is that it is a tad heaver than I expected, although this is a trade-off I am willing to accept! :)"
4,Great little vac!,I bought this hand vac after my Shark hand vac blew up. I needed something powerful to remove dog hair from my leather couches. This vac has some POWER! The only thing that would make it better is if it had a larger extension. I tried to look on Eureka's website but they don't offer an extension for this model.
4,Lots of suction with brutal brush,"Our upright was not getting our stairs as clean we wanted, so we bought this to do the job - and to take care of occasional spills.Things we LOVE about this Vacuum:+ Front guard is adjustable, making it great for our stairs.+ Rotating brush has it's own motor.+ Very Powerful. Our stairs have never been so clean.+ Holds a lot of dirt for its size.+ Nice long cord+ Works very well on both our carpeted stairs and wood floor.+ Handy crevice toolTHings I wish were better:- Loud- HeavyNote: Even though this is loud - most vacs are and a little heavy for its size, it does an swesome job. HIghly recommended."
4,"Powerful, big and heavy, unwieldy","This vacuum is a handheld on steroids - even the cord is one of those thick heavy ones you find on outside extension cords (though this is two-pronged). Powerful but heavy and a bit loud. If you are looking for industrial strength suction this is the one, if you are looking for a typical handheld, it is not. And insofar as doing draperies and anything vertical, you better have very good upper body strength cause it gets heavy and unwieldy very fast. Not to be sexist, but I think most women would find it hard to handle doing anything vertical with it ( I did). Only have had it for a few days so can't comment on durability. Worth the money if you specially want a heavy-duty model."
5,Best Hand-held vacuum I've ever had,"I have been looking for a hand-held vacuum for several years. I needed to replace my old one which was in the process of dying. I wanted an electric not a battery-operated hand-held so I could get maximum power. This one is terrific. The beater-bar head is built in and a hose for tight corners is attached, so need to change parts out. Now, if it lasts for years it will be absolutely perfect. (I've only had it for about a month.) Great price, too."
5,Powerful & Efficient Vacuum,"No doubt this vacuum is super strong. It doesn't blow away dirt like some complaints on other brands. It sucks in so much dirt that you really need to empty the cup frequently. However, comparing to the result, all the efforts are worthy."
2,"Works reliably, but the cord is very annoying, and the air shoots out at you (read more)","I bought this vacuum several months ago to use for quick clean ups when I don't feel like taking out my big vacuum. Unfortunately, I made the wrong decision when I picked this vacuum. The cord is nice and long, but very annoying to coil it back in place. Once you have it coiled up in its slot, you have to tightly clasp the plug to the cord and if you don't get it tight enough, it unravels again. I always find myself spending way too much time putting this little vacuum away and I think to myself ""I should have just used my regular vacuum."" And another annoying thing about this vacuum - the air shoots out of the back, which often times blows the dust/crumbs/whatever mess all over the place. I really don't like this vacuum and I'm going to buy a cordless dust buster to replace it."
3,"Great vacuum, short life","I got it in November of 2006, and this little vacuum was pretty sweet. It did an awesome job on the stairs and the hose attachment was good for getting into some of the hard to clean areas around the house. I was always amazed to see how much ""stuff"" it was picking up off the floor. Kinda gross.But, not all good things are meant to last apparently. In Feb of '08, this little guy died in a blaze of glory. The back end lit up like the Fourth of July and a bunch of sparks went flying out the back. 16 months after I had gotten it, it was dead.However, because it did such a great job while I had it, I'm considering getting another one to replace it. That's why I'm giving it three stars instead of 1. When it works, its a 5-star product, but its short life knocks it down a couple of notches."
1,motore burned out after 3 uses,"Title says it all; never really got to find out how well it worked because the motor started to smoke and arc, and then died, after only 3 short, light uses. Needless to say, not a happy purchase."
3,Not as great as reviews seemed,"I bought this vacuum based on all of the great reviews. It's okay, the suction is strong enough to pick up dirt but it is not like super powerful or anything. It is good for getting pet hairs off of upholstery and vacuuming stairs. I think it would be great if they put a strap on this so you could carry it on your back with a long extention hose that way you wouldn't have to bend down and scoot every few feet to get whatever you want vacuumed. Basically the only things I would use it for is upholstery and stairs. Anything else would be too laborous because of how short the hose is and because it is hand held and fairly heavy for a handheld."
3,Wish this had a longer wand,"I purchased this because I have a bad shoulder and other orthopedic problems. I wanted something powerful and easy to use for under the counter cleaning in my carpeted kitchen and other quick clean ups. The attachments are very short and you have to bend all the way down to utilize this unit. The workmanship and power is wonderful, it picks up great and also is easy to clean. I called all over for a longer attachment, even Eureka and it is not an option. If anyone knows of something for this, please let me know."
2,"Great suction power, but weight and power cord are negatives","This little handheld vacuum cleaner has great suction power. But that's really all I have good to say. I bought it because it had so many good reviews, but I'm not too happy with it.- It's as heavy as my Bosch canister vaccuum, except I have to bend over to use it, which is actually harder on my back.- The weight wouldn't be so bad if it didn't also have a cord. I never thought to make sure a small handheld vacuum would be ""cordless""...just assumed it would be. The cord defeats the purpose of the convenience in my opinion. Also, you have to manually unwrap and rewrap the cord to put it away. At least my canister vac has one of the cords you pull on, and it automatically rewinds itself.- My last complaint about is the exhaust air shoots out the back/bottom side, which sometimes blows the very things you're trying to vacuum across the room if you're not careful."
1,Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum 71B,"I looked at many hand-held vacuums before chosing this one. Most of the reviews were good. The firt time I used it, although it was a little heavy for a hand-held, I was pleased with the suction and the brush. Today, was the second time. What a nightmare! I took off the hose to add the crevice tool which worked fine, but reattaching the hose to the vacuum was horrible. I tried, my husband tried, I tried again, etc. We finally got it back on with much difficulty and it came off as I was vacuumimg. My husband said, ""Send it back!"" I shall."
3,Just OK,"It is powerful but it is heavy...much too heavy for a handheld vacuum. Also, when you use the hose the air from the base blows all the dust around."
5,Awsome little machine,"I purchased this vacuum for myself and was so pleased with it that I bought two more - one for each of my daughters. It is great on pet hair and picks up other dirt that I didn't even know was there. It's really great to find a product that really ""delivers"" as promised."
4,Eureka Hand Vac model 71A is heavy,"On the positive side, this hand vac cleans well. The wand attachment tool is easily stored. Cord length is generous.On the negative side, it's far heavier than a hand vac ought to be and the user will tire quicker. The option to clean a vertical surface is of limited use. after all, how many times does one need to clean the vertical face of the carpet going up steps? A brush attachment would do just as well for a surface like this that gets minimum wear. But, alas, the mfr includes only a crevice tool.Overall, it's in the same class as Dirt Devil hand vacs. But it has the edge on (appearance) design and appears to suction just a tad better. The weight issue is really one to make myou think twice about this unit."
4,Great little product,This hand held vacuum is great for spills and cleaning small areas with the hose and accessory. It can get a little heavy if you use it for long periods and you can't really use it to vacuum large areas. I also wish it came with more attachments. But it is a great compliment to a regular size vacuum cleaner.
3,It's okay,It has good suction but the hose is way to short! You can pull it out some but you have to be very careful that it doesn't spring back and pinch you!
3,Dissappointed,Product has already been serviced.Would not replace even though it was less than 1 month old. The service provider did fix the issue ( the spinner brush quit working )but was surprised that they did not replace.
5,great little thing,i wanted something small to clean my car. this is what i found and been using it a lot. has a nice sized toob and also good spots to put the adapters.
4,Decent.,"Long cord; I use it on my car instead of the gastation vacuum. I don't really like it's shape (a smaller, less fragile design on top would be better), but I am not returning it. I like that it's plugged in and it's life does not equal the battery recharge memory."
4,Hates Housework,"I really love this strong little vacuum, except for one thing. I find it's impossible to switch off after it's been switched to the ""spin brush"" setting. Perhaps the engineer who designed the switch should have had someone who wasn't a gorilla test it. I'm a pretty strong woman (I rack up servers), but I have to vacuum with a flathead screwdriver in my pocket so I can use it to help me switch it off after vacuuming stairs. My thumbs hurt from trying to switch it off!Another thought - I'm dreaming of the day someone invents a hand vacuum that has a bagless cup that does not have a sticky dust-attracting inside-out envelope thing to catch the dirt. Why was that ever a good idea? Maybe it has to do with providing both suction and containment of dirt, but I think there must be a better way.Hey all you young women out there -- get into engineering and design stuff that you love instead of having to accept stuff that is just okay. I wish I'd done that!"
5,Pretty good,"Worked perfectly as I expected. A bit heavy to carry in the hand. But other than that, it's a great product."
4,Great Product,"This is a great little product. It works much better than any little dustbuster and the brush head really helps to pick up stuff. My cat hair on the couch and stairs dont stand a chance. The hose and tool are convenient. My only complaint is the storage of the cord is poorly engineered and easily slips off the unit when you are trying to store it and there is no way to unroll just what you need. Basically it is all or nothing, meaning if I want to use it I must unroll more cord than I care to roll back up. I wish it had a self retracting cord or a better way to store the cord. If it werent for this cord issue it would get 5 stars."
5,A powerful machine,"This is a really powerful piece of machine, has good suction power. It is well designed. I like it and would also recommend to others. The only minor improvement it needs to make is - the power and scrubber on/off switch needs to be tightened, it comes off as loose, as its slips its designated spots."
5,This item just plain SUCKS,"Rarely has something delivered with quite such jaw-dropping performance as this little hand-held vacuum. We have gone through Dirt Devils, Dysons, other name-brand hand-helds, as well as various attachments for upright machines, and none have perfomed as well as this little Eureka. It removes everything, it's light, it's a breeze to empty, and in the $30-$40 price range it's a slam-dunk-hands-down-money-saving-carpet-cleaning beast.Put in cart. Click buy. Wait 4-5 days. Bask in the glory of dustless, particle-free stairs, crevesses, and anything else that needs a good cleaning."
5,Amazing Vacuum,I have purchased hundreds of items on Amazon and this is the first review I have ever written. That is how amazed I was with the power of this vacuum. So much better than a dustbuster because of the rotating brushes.
2,Busted,"Got it 6 months ago. Have used it about 20 times in a small area. Something snapped inside. The brush no longer spins, and the motor runs with a scream. I am certain that if I run it further it will explode.Meh"
1,One year limited use vacuum,This was a good vacuum for the 12 or so times it has been used over the last year. It is now broken. The beater brush does not spin. I thought I would get more than a few uses from a Eureka product.
4,"Gets the job done, easy to maintain",What a great vacuum for the stairs and tight areas. Hands down this out performs others on the market for what seems yo be half the price.
3,Pretty handy if you have a small apartment / room,"This is pretty good and picks up most of the stuff on my carpet and is handy because I have a small studio, but it's definitely not the right product if you need things to be spotless."
4,just what we needed,"We wanted a light weight hand held vacuum that was easy to use to pick up dog hair on furniture. We have been disappointed in the past with cordless hand helds as they seemed to lack power or did not hold a charge so this is our first corded hand held. It did a good job on dog hair on upholstered furniture. The cord is sturdy and plenty long enough to cover a room without constantly having to move to another outlet which I have had on some vacuums. It has a nice balance of feeling well made and sturdy but light enough that you don't need to be a weight lifter to handle it. The see throgh dirt trap was easy to remove and reinstall and lets you know the vacuum is working and when it needs to be emptied. For what we needed, this is just fine"
4,Nicely designed to do the trick,"Car vacuuming made easy. Also good for vacuuming out the area beneath the lint trap in the dryer. And the fridge coils that get clogged with dust.Like it a lot.Edited to add that it seemed to stop working (i.e. it fired up and made the vacuum noise when you turned it on, but there was no vacuum power, it didn't suck anything up or grab onto any debris), and I was ready to chuck it but then I took a closer look and found a candy wrapper clogging up the hose attachment (it was deep on the inside), and once I managed to dislodge it using an old unbent wire coat hanger, it worked like new again. So be careful vacuuming up bigger debris with the hose attachment, because if that side hose gets blocked with old leaves, wrappers, etc. then it kills the vacuum power of the entire unit."
3,Good but too small,"Good but too small to clean the floor. I think it is probably mainly used to clean small carpet, but if you want to use it to clean floor, you definitely have a wrong idea."
3,Not bad but should be bigger,"Gets the job done but has to be emptied too often. I went ahead and bought some extra new filters thinking that I'd have to change them regularly. Upon further inspection, I found that I had clogged the hose going into the vacuum by sucking up lots of hair, bottle caps, hard candy, etc. Once I cleared the clog, the vacuum started sucking again like it was new. I guess I'll put those new filters on the shelf. This is a great vacuum. I am still impressed with the great suction of this vacuum. After 3 weeks I was disappointed to find the suction dropped by maybe 70%. I thought that was because I had sucked up dog hair that had clogged the filter."
3,Great for the first 12 months,"For the first 12 months we owned this, it was GREAT! It's light, powerful, and does a really excellent job- especially on stairs. Then this weekend, 1 month after the warranty expired, it died in the most spectacular and frightening way. My son was turned it on to vacuum the car and it started making weird grinding noises and smelling funny. This was unbeknownst to me until I tried to use it the next day only to hear the same noises and then a cascade of sparks and smoke shot out of the back of the vac.If you love a little workhorse for not a lot of money, buy it.If you don't love surprise pyrotechnics after warranty expiration, buy something else."
4,Good Stuff,The vacuum is powerful and does a great job. The flip visor lets you vacuum at a 90 or 180 degree. You can also detach the hose at one end and use it with the attachment to get into those really tight spots. The hose isn't that long (16 inches) so the reach is really limited.The only thing I don't like about the vacuum is the fact that it is bagless which means you have to see the dirt you picked up one more time. I didn't take any points off for the bagless design though because I knew that going in.I would buy this vac again - bagless or not.
3,Powerful but still Tethered,"We have been searching for a powerful cordless hand held vac for a while and even though we knew the Eureka was AC powered the reviews made it a possible candidate, so we purchased and tried it out. Without a doubt this hand held vac ""really does suck"", as good as any upright, but indeed it is very noisy and again, having to use an AC cord always has you running around to locate the nearest plug in. The latter was eventually the reason we returned the vac to Amazon and purchased the B&D; 1800 hand held battery operated vac.As usual and always expected no worries doing business with Amazon."
4,powerfull and easy to use,"Man thus vacuum cleaner can suck up dirt. The thing is seriously strong for its size. It has a long power cord, about 25ft or so that gets stored at the back around the cleaner. There is an easy to use switch on the top that powers the unit on or off, and a 3rd setting to activate the roller brushes. (excellent for tiles or carpets)The only complaints I have, is with the noise, the neighbors are going to know you are cleaning the house. In addition to the dust bucket being finnegy to get out and back in. Make sure you have the unit over a dust bin or trash bag before opening it as it can spill dust all over. Lastly, although the pipe can be stored nicely on the unit, it is a bit short, a longer pipe or maybe an extension would be a nice addition.For the price, this unit rocks."
4,Works ok but very small,"This vacuum is very small, the compartment fills up with dirty quickly... it does have good suction tho and he small size allows my kids to help with the chores. I let them us this vacuum while I my larger upright vacuum."
1,If you want to spread the dust evenly......,"Being in Afghanistan, the dust here is very fine and pervasive. I need vacuum that can contain that dust and not simply suck it up and spread it back around. This was not that vacuum. I swear, more dirt and filth shot out the exhaust than was in the dust bin. The roller only turned when the switch was ""just perfect"". I would recommend this to people who simply like to hear the sound of the vacuum, without actually cleaning anything."
5,Two thumbs WAY up!!,And ditto to all the great comments regarding pet hair. I vacummed the stairs with my regular upright and then went over them again with this handy hand-held. A fistful of cat hair and dust was sucked up and away.Thank you Eureka!
4,huge help,I got this to keep by the couch for when my dog jumps up and gets hair all over. It does a nice job of getting her hair up. Also easier to vacuum the stairs with. Just wish it was cordless.
4,hand-held vacuum,"A very efficient machine for doing stairs which is what I bought it for. It is a little heavy to handle up and down the stairs, but it is powerful and does the job."
1,Wasn't told there was no convertor kit for Australia....,"It looks a really great vacuum, but unfortunately I cannot use it here in Australia. I thought when it was sold to an Australian customer that itwould be compliant to our electricity. So I cannot rate it....sadly. So if you are not in a country that has the same power type as the USA beware....!"
3,so-so,"For some reason, I thought this was a portable vacuum cleaner. It sort of is, but only in the sense you can carry it in one hand. I thought it had a rechargeable battery that enabled you to completely walk around with it.No: it has a really long cord, but it's not cordless: merely hand-held."
1,Awful!!!,"This is the most poorly designed hand-vac I have ever seen! I just received mine and tried to vacuum up some clumps of dust and dog fur and it was a nightmare. This unit has plenty of suction (at least at first - I've only used it once), but it blows everything around! The exhaust is on the bottom so when you get close to what you want to vacuum up, it scatters everything across the floor. The clumps of fur even went flying up a foot or two in the air! It just made things worse. I will be looking into getting a refund immediately."
3,Eureka hand Vaccum,This is a good product but u have to bend down to use it. Performance is good. I like it but would have liked if it had a handle making it easier to use!
1,Not too good an experience,"Product arrived on time, except could not work at first start. Tried Eureka customer service. Customer service not very good. Product now used as a toy for kids. And kids love it!"
4,Powerful little vaccum,Just picked up this vacuum up for cleaning up our vehicles and furniture. Only had this for a day and I am pretty impressed with how well it seems to work. It seems to be a very powerful little vacuum. It easily picks up my dog's hair from the couch and other furniture. Hope this helps
1,Good idea poor execution,"Purchased about 2 years ago. On the upside, the vacuum generates an impressive amount of suction. It picks up pet hair and is great on stairs.On the downside 1) the ""filter"" is not terribly efficient. When you empty the dirt cup make sure to power the unit back on outside - it emits a very substantial cloud of dust when you first turn it on. Better still buy three or four extra filters and wash them between uses. 2) The dirt cup is quite small and requires frequent emptying. This then leads to the problem noted in 1). 3) The slide switch that selects the operating mode and releases the dirt cup jammed. The only way to operate it was to force the switch with a screw driver. Then the switch broke, rendering the vacuum useless. I really miss my dirt devil."
5,Surprising power in a small package,"Moving to a home with so many carpeted stairs, I quickly learned that vaccuming stairs could be a back-breaking chore. Though my upright vaccum has a hose, the attachments are small and do not pick up pet hair well and I have to drag the upright up and down to reach them all. This little vaccum solved all those problems and more. I have been impressed with the pick-up power of such a small vaccum. I have owned this vaccum for nearly 1 year now and am still very happy with the purchase. Great product!"
4,Pleased ...with reservations,"The vacuum was purchased largely due to the high ratings it received on Amazon.com and it has not disappointed. We have been super impressed with the power this little vacuum packs! While it is typically tasked with clean-up around the entryway, it has exceeded our expectations when we challenge it with bigger jobs... The only annoying thing we have found so far is the button which moves forward to engage the brush sometimes does not work if it is pushed too far forward. Sometimes you need to fiddle with it to get the brush mechanism to start."
4,Amber,I have a siberian husky and a long hair cat. The only thing that bugs me is that it blows the hair a bit on the hard wood. Love it other than that! Buy this!
4,Great deal!,"What a great price for a surprisingly powerful vacuum! Just what I was looking for to use on my staircase. Also works great on vacuuming up dog hair and for those small jobs for which you don't want to drag out the upright vacuum. My only wish is that it had a HEPA filter, but doesn't matter much when only using it on small areas."
5,Ovarall Great,"Like it very much. Using mainly to vacuum my desk top, keyboard, other light office jobs. Definitely I wish the hose was at least twice as long. Hard to find short extensions of any kind. Six-foot extension is about the shortest available and that would have been too long. Ordered me a 3 ft leaves blower hose in hopes it 'll fit, with a universal adapter, if necessary. I WOULD like to have a longer hose to be able to maneuver around the office desk/furniture. Still, a Five Star rating considering the pluses."
5,i have no complaints,"I got this vacuum to clean up my small apartment, which collects cat hair and litter quickly. Rather than haul out a large vacuum, this handheld one does the trick. I wanted one with a plug, so that I wouldn't run the risk of it being dead when I need it.This thing gets used about twice a week, and it works great! It picks up cat litter and hair. It could maybe pick up a little more hair, but my cats shed a TON. Love the extendable hose. Like the title says, no complaints!"
5,Very handy,"This little vac has lots of power and works great for smallareas, cars and motor homes. Easy to use in high and tight places.You can use brush or just hose, brush works great on motor home floor.It will shut off if it gets hot, so don't wait until the cup fills and clogs,but dump it frequently and knock out dust from cup. Other than that itdoes a great job, lots better than any shop vac."
4,"Lots of suction, But...","The Eureka Vac does have alot of suction, and that's great. Easy to use on the floor, but heavy (which I expected). However, when I used it to vaccuum the car, it was hard to maneuver when using the wand. It did do a good job cleaning and getting out debris and dirt and even larger items. I expect that to have a large amount of suction, the vaccuum can't be any smaller, so it comes with the territory. It was just awkward in small spaces. All in all, a decent buy, and I expect to get alot of use from it."
5,Powerful.,This is a great powerful vacuum and its cheap. The only negative is that its loud and heavy. It weighs a lot. Other than that I like it.
4,Cool for what it is,"It's cool and works exactly as described. It's not going to move mountains but it's plenty powerful. The vent placement is extremely annoying and often ends up blowing away the stuff you're trying to vacuum. Takes a little getting used to.I give it 4 stars for what it is, the price and the quality. However, if you're thinking of getting the dyson because it's cordless, powerful and has a ton of tools, don't be cheap and get the Dyson. I should have done the same. That being said, this will get good use."
5,Clean dog hair off my couch like new,"You can not imagine how many hairs a beagle dog will shed everyday. My chocolate brown corduroy couch were like covered by a layer of white ashes, and the dog hairs are like rooted on my couch, it was very hard to remove them. So I went online to search for a good hand vac, and I found this Eurika 71B, I bought it, I could not stand the dog hair on my couch and stain on my clothes, and got carried to my car, and my work chair. Well, this vacuum did not fail me, it did great job in cleaning my couch, it can be hairless like new again. The rich chocolate brown color show beautifully again. I can't tell you how happy I am with the job this vacuum did. I can't live without this vac any more.But every product has it perfect area of performance, as to vacuum on a car, it will do the job, but not very idea, it will need an outlet near by, you will need to held it by one hand, the other hand need to handle the hose, then it will be too heavy. As the couch job, I love it."
5,Good little vac,"Very good suction. Nice to have the handheld hose and adapter to reach small places. The brush guard flip feature so you can easily do stair risers is nice. You can turn the brushes on or off.Not as light as they make it out to be, but has a nice long cord and does a great job."
3,Nice Vacuum,"I have to say that this is nice little vacuum. I had it for about two years, and used it quite heavily. Works great on stairs and is especially great for vacuuming the car. Has a nice long cord so you dont have to unplug constantly. My one complaint is that the flexible tube broke and i had to tape it up. Definitely worth the 40 bucks"
5,Great vacuum.,I bought this for my wife to deal with cat liter clean up. All of the rechargeable models lose power after a while. Not this thing. Just buy yourself a couple of extra filters and keep cleaning. I think this thing was like 20 bucks at the time and three years later its still going strong. This is really well designed and has a places to wrap the cord and hold the crevice attachment. Oh yeah you can have work with or without the spinning brush head.
1,crap,"replacement filters don't fit the unit well, so tonight, 5 minutes ago, while I'm trying to clean up my office, I filled the air with thick dust, which is now settling on everything. WTF.There is a small gap between the filter where it is supposed to sit.Huge mess, now."
4,At Last...no cat hair,This is a very efficient little vacuum for stairs and small spaces. It is fairly efficient at vacuuming pet hair off clothes. The only problem with it is it's weight-too heavy to use for a long time for vertical cleaning.
4,Cat Hair,I ordered this vacuum because the reviews said it was great for cat hair. It works fairly well but I wish it was better at picking up the hair.
5,SUPER!!,"Received this vacuum today, already used it and cleaned my house and furniture, the hose is fabulous, very strong sucking...the furniture brush is ok, does a good job, was hoping it was really the answer for pet hair, but it is good enough...Love this item, best small vac I have ever used ...highly recommend..and it's YELLOW.."
5,Great,"I have been meaning to write this review for some time. I have received this vacuum cleaner as a gift about a year ago and it still appears to be in perfect shape. It really does what a vacuum cleaner is supposed to do as opposed to so many other models that don't. The only thing I wish could be improved is the stretchability of the hose. It is quite short. It works for what I use it for though, namely, cleaning a chinchilla cage and spot cleaning carpet and tile. Also worth mentioning is the fact that it is super easy to unclog it because the hose can be easily removed from the unit. This product deserves five stars."
4,Great for stairs,I bought this vacuum mainly for cleaning my stairs since vacuuming with an upright is so tedious and frustrating. This vacuum is light and works really well. My only complaint is that its pretty loud. Other than that it works perfect for what I wanted it for.
3,Eureka Hand Held Vacuum,"I loved this vacuum, especially for vacuuming my stairs. For a small vacuum, it had lots of power and seemed to pick up alot. It is heavy but not as heavy as lugging my upright vacuum up the stairs....Only had the vacuum for less than 2 months and the motor that turns the brush stopped working. I'm hoping to get a replacment because I'd love to give it a second shot."
1,Broken after four uses,"Bought it to vacuum my car, worked very well for this purpose. However, after fourth time using it the unit shut off presumably due to overheating or a broken belt. Unit refuses to turn on. Can't find a way to get to belt to take a look -- there are hidden screws somewhere! Local vacuum repair places want to more money to fix it then I paid for the unit. Too bad I threw out the box after the third usage or I'd try to return it to Amazon. What a joke of an item and a waste of money. Lessons learned: never buy Eureka and always save the box!!!"
1,was great until it broke-3 months after we bought it,Great vacuum until it stops working. Mine lasted a solid 3-4 months. The on/off switch stopped working. Don't waste your money
1,The two second vacuum!,"I chose the Eureka 71B over the new model of the Royal Dirt Devil based on the glowing reviews here. Wish I could give you a review of how it works but the darn thing shorted out after about two seconds!That's right- I read the instructions, plugged it in and switched it on.A loud whirring noise followed by a bright flash from inside the yellow case and a puff of smoke. Two seconds of fireworks, no seconds of vacuuming.I'm not taking a chance on a second sample either-even though I purchased an extra filter that will cost me a re-stocking fee and return postage to the vendor."
1,"Sucks everything up, spits it back out","I don't have time for a video review, or else I would show all of you fools how terrible this vacuum really is. I can't believe all of these 5 star ratings. Did you people actually use the thing? The only way it sucks things up is by using the hose--the roller is completely useless. As soon as you turn the thing off, it drops whatever was picked up in the roller right back on your floor! And god forbid you try and suck up a massive mess! Try spilling baby powder or flour or any sort of fine substance on your floor, and watch the Eureka 71B Hand-Held POS suck up all of it and spit it right back out, AT YOU!!!! All the dirt flies in the front, and then out the so-called ""exhaust port,"" and ALL OVER YOUR CLOTHES. WHAT A PIECE OF POOP. I would swear all I could if Amazon would allow it, because this is the biggest waste of 45 dollars that I have ever spent.FOOLS!!!!!!!!!"
1,IT IS NOT CORDLESS,"The reviews looked great, and I almost bought this...until one of the pictures showed a cord. Amazon, you're showing this item under the title ""Cordless Hand-Held Vacuums,"" but it's NOT cordless. It may be a great little vacuum, BUT IT'S NOT CORDLESS. The is the second time in the last few days that I've found this type of mistake on Amazon. Now I know that I can't take any thing on Amazon for granted. Well, I still like Amazon, but from now on I'll be watching it like a hawk. lEureka 71B Hand-Held Vacuum"
2,There's a piece missing!,I just opened the box and the crevice tool that was supposed to be included is not there. So now I guess my options are to pack this whole thing back up and send it back at my inconvenience or live without the tool that SUPPOSED to be included. I'm not at all happy.
2,Not Worth It,I ordered this to pick up pet hair off the furniture. I wasted my money. I will probably wind up purchasing a Dyson.
2,No way to clean the brush roll,"I didn't like this product because when you clean carpet floors, the brush roll is going to have a lot of hairs and is impossible to take the roll off so to clean it takes a long time. Why should I keep this product if vacuum cleaners are made to make our life easier?"
1,Broke after one cleaning.,Hate writing a negative review... but this product was a dismal failure and the only way I am going to get my money's worth out of it is by writing this review.Have a small photo studio and I needed a small cleaner to get into crevices. The price was right and it preformed like a champion... once!!! After that it never worked right... spend a few more dollars and get something better. Very disappointed!
1,Bought 2 and both quickly failed.,"Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71BI bought two of these and they both failed after just a couple hours of total use. The brush stopped spinning on both units and could not be fixed. The switch was very hard too push and sometimes I would push it to far and the dust collection container would fall off spilling dirt and dust all over. They did have good suction, really picked up per hair, when they worked. I bought them based on all the good reviews I read. Oh well, live and learn.I've had other Eureka vacuums that worked great and lasted for years but this one is terrible in my opinion."
2,ON FIRE,We had this vaccuum for almost two years and at first it worked great but about a month ago it all went wrong!!!!! I was using it on the stairs and it started smoking from the back then all of a sudden it has flames coming from the back of it and spit out soot. I ran to unplug it and then raced to the door and threw the whole thing outside fearing it would start the carpet on fire. I have no idea what happened because I had never had a problem with it before and I kept it clean.
1,literally sucks,"I bought this to use cleaning out my car. Used it once and it didn't work worth a darn. performed just like most handheld vacs I've owned, a waste of money. Back to using my big vac. Have put the hand held vac in the storage shed and will give it to anyone who wants it. Don't believe all the reviews that say it is rated real high."
1,broken before a month old,I bought this hand held less the a month ago and it is already broken. I would love to send it back but not sure how.
1,Too Darn Heavy!!!! Not worth it.,I bought this because of the rave reviews but my dirt devil works just as well on my stair cases. This is just too heavy. I read that from other reviews but thought well....how heavy can it be. It is heavy enough that it makes it hard to use one hand to use it. My hand and wrist was tired after using it and I don't think I'll use it often because of it.
1,I just don't get it...,"Couldn't wait to get this vacuum and my husband beat me to opening and trying it out. He said, ""I just don't get it"". When you turn on the vacuum and lower it to the ground to pick up the dust, the exhaust (located at the bottom) blows all the stuff away as you move it. So you end up sweeping the dirt again, only to have it happen again. There's no way around it. The cord isn't long enough to be able to vacuum a sofa. There's more, but it's really not worth it. It's being returned and I feel let down by my Amazon ratings...first time EVER my choice was wrong."
5,Happy Days!!,My wife has been searching for a Vac like this for the 2 years we have lived in a house with stairs. She is elated with the performance of this simple machine. I wish more products were this rewarding.
5,Eureka hand-held vacuum,"This vacuum is powerful, light, and can extend all over any given space, due to its long cord. Cleaning out the dust bin is no fun, but I don't know if there's any way around that. It's small enough to store easily on a closet shelf, too -- which is good, as it doesn't have any way to hang, and the cord doesn't have anything to wrap around. I'm very pleased with this vacuum and hope it lasts a long time!"
3,Mixed feelings....,I bought this hand held vacuum to clean the carpet on the stairs. It has great suction but was very surprized to find that I could not clean with a back and forth motion. I could vacuum only by pulling it toward me. I tried it on various carpet pile heights and still could only move the vacuum toward me. Maybe the rotating brush inhibits it. The 20' foot cord was great. The product does deliver on great cleaning ability due to the suction that I doubt would be there in a rechargeable hand held vac.
4,Good buy,This vacuum works great! The only flaws are that it has to be emptied pretty often because of it's small size and that it's too loud for my taste.
4,Very Nice For The Price,"I bought it to vacuum 150 chairs. Picks up everything very nicely, even hair. There is however one design flaw that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. The handle on the top has squared edges. By the time I got to the last 50 chairs those edges were very uncomfortable on my hand. I was glad we didn't have 200 chairs, as I believe it would have left blisters. Simply rounding the edges would make the grip more comfortable. One more flaw: I wish they would have spent 15 more cents on a decent cord for it. The cord is very stiff. On a positive note: you would not believe how much dust it picked up out of the chairs."
4,"Fantastic, while it lasted","This thing worked amazingly well when we first bought it. It was terrific! After about one year of occasional use, however, it just barely sucks up anything. It went in the trash. For the first year, however, it was great."
3,"Good price, Powerful, but.....","Nice powerful little vacuum. A little heavy, not to the point that I would discourage purchase based on that alone. My biggest complaint is the exhaust air blows any debris that happens to be behind it, this can be frustrating at times. I would have to say that among the handhelds that I've owned this one is near the top in performance. Would I purchase again? Maybe."
4,So far so good.,Has held up well. Is easy to use. The flip up opening is convenient. Works well. Cleanout is easy but could be better as the dust tends to stick to the filter. You do need to clean out hairs and fibers from the brush occasionally to keep the beater bar spinning at full speed. But not as bad as some others I have used. Cord is long. Hose is removable for easy cleaning with the edge attachment.
5,Versatile vacuum!,"I've had my eye on the Eureka for months and finally pulled the trigger over Black Friday weekend.I mainly bought this to use for vacuuming our vehicles and it works wonderful. I have two other small vacuums that just wasn't that great for car vacuuming. What sets the Eureka apart from the competition is the rotating brush. It does wonders on the car carpets. It has plenty of suction that is superior to most small vacuumsAlso, it's great for vacuuming carpeted steps too. In addition, I found an unexpected vacuuming use for it. We have two cats that love to get behind our sofas. So the backside of the sofas gets very hairy. I decided to run the rotating brush over the backside of the couch and the vacuum makes short work of the cat hair.Also, if you are needing to vacuum in tight spots, etc. I recommend this kit as an add-on:http://www.amazon.com/Micro-Vacuum-Attachment-Kit-Piece/dp/B000BSJCLY/ref=pd_bxgy_hg_img_y"
3,decent hand held vacuum while it lasts,"The vacuum itslef has good suction power and we used it to clean the cars, steps etc. -- places where it is hard to get a regular sized vacuum. The weak point of this is the rotating brush on the front. Once you get a few hairs inside it, this gets tangled up and stops turning. Cleaning it is a lengthy process involving removing some screws and cutting the hair off with a utility knife. After this happened a couple of times, the plastic drive bit connecting the brush and motor broke rendering the brush useless. Without the brush, this is not as effective. Overall, it lasted for about an year of occasional (couple of times a month) use."
2,partially broken machine,The one bought from Amazon was a crack.Very hard to push the buttons to turn on/ off and open the cup to clean the filter. The power is fine. I threw away the one bought from Amazon.
5,? I have had hardwood floors and swept everythjngI have finally decided to get a vacuum,"Has got to be top 5 favourite thinngs in my houseEasily wrapped up cord . Semi cute lookLove that it has the little ""duster"" brushes so itCan sweep up the durt into itself .Very wonderful totally worth it havent done all theReplaicing on filters yet ""clueless"" but im thinkingOf washing this filter and using it again .Someone reply to this if thats the dumbestIdea ever please .Inexperienced vacuum newbie"
5,Eureka 71B Hand held vacuum,Great! Amazing how much suction it has for a small vacuum! I use it mostly for stairs and furniture.
4,excellent hand vacuum,Great for easy furniture cleaning. Light weight. Excellent suction. Would be nice if it had a few attachments (the only reason I didn't give this five stars) but the hose is ok for quick clean ups. also good in small spaces.
4,hand held vac,Works great for the car. The only negative is I wish it came with a small circular dust brush attachment. This item can be purchased at any vacuum store and I will get one.
5,Eureka!!,This vacuum is awesome for stairs. I live in a three level townhouse and this was the best vacuum I could find that make cleaning the stairs a breeze. GET DOWN!
3,"Eureka 71B Power ""Yes"" User Friendly ""Not so much""",I like the length of the cord and it is very easy to dump and clean filter. Love theeasy access and storage of the attachment. So why a 3 rating - because it is awkward asheck to use with the hose (my primary use of it) and the wrap around way the cord isstored is not the best - you have to let the entire cord unwind for a minutes use.But as I said it is the awkwardness of the hose attachment that is frustrating. If you useit as a regular sweep then I would say it rates a solid 4 - because of the cord.
4,Perfect for stairs,"We just had laminate flooring installed and needed a way to quickly vacuum the stairs. This is the answer. It is light and maneuverable and has strong suction. The power cord is farly long, enough we can do an entire flight of stairs.The only cons to this vac is it only comes with one tool (a crevice tool), but there is limited storage on the vac anyway.One word of caution, do not use this to vacuum dry wall dust, even a little bit, it will clog the filter."
4,It SUCKS (in a good way),"I got this for the purpose of cleaning stairs....I was happy to see how much power was abvailable. The rotating blade considerably improves the availability of sucking in dirt when compared to dust busters. Anyway, I enjoy how it has a rotating shield so it does stair raisers. The attachment for the hose covientently tucks it away and the cord storage is easy too. So far so good with it. I would buy it again. Oh..and I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars b/c the hose attachment does not have a bristle attachment to prevent me from scuffing the baseboard when I run it along it."
4,Seems to be as good as the reviews say,"Just got my Eureka 71B Hand-Held Vacuum and started using it in my RV (aka the ""tWinnebago"").The reviews were stellar, which led me to choose this model. From the initial use, the positive reviews are accurate. It is a solid vacuum with a lot of nice design features. For example, the crevice tool locks into the the air output valve - my upright doesn't even have this accessory storage figured out!Great power and the price is right. If you're looking for a hand held for on the go clean ups, this is a good choice."
2,mine was a waste after a couple months,"I don't know if it is because we have a dog, but this little eureka was a real waste after a couple months. The filter was hard to clean and it just stopped having any suction power. I loved the idea of having a little vac for the kids to use, and me too, for the stairs, so it would be a little more fun...but I ended up throwing this out. It was great in the beginning."
4,Good Work & Easy To Use,"I bought this because I really needed a handheld to get in the tiny grooves and get out cat hair. This vacuum is REALLY big and heavy, but it gets the job done! My white carpet looks pristine. I would buy one again, but it would be nice to have one as powerful as this without the weight."
4,Good power in small package,"Nice little vacuum. Good power, works great on stairs and for small cleanups. Also good for use in the car."
4,A great vacuum cleaner for it's size & price,"This is a great vacuum cleaner for it's size & price. Only minus I could think of after using it is the absence of a removable & replacable dust bag, which would make removing the collected dust from the dust chamber easier & clog the dust filter less over prolonged use.Didn't have time enough to see if other vacuums in this size/category have removable dust bags.Otherwise, in general I am v. happy using this vacuum cleaner for the single room that I live in at my rented apartment (am a grad student) at the University here."
4,ladybug,I have owned this hand vacuum for about 2 weeks and love it. I especially use i on stairs and in our car and it works great. The 25 foot card is quit handy.
4,This thing sucks!,"Really powerful little vac. Would have given it 5 stars if the pull out hose was a little longer. Purchased it for quick clean up of pet hair and a car vac and it serves it's purpose well. Tired of the plug in, charge up the battery type vacs. Never seemed to be charged when I needed them and the batteries never hold a long enough charge. Vac has a decent length cord, but I purchase an extra 25' cord to reach out to the driveway."
4,Awesome,"This vacuum sucks up soo much stuff - simply amazing. I liked it so much I have convinced 2 other people to buy it and have convinced others that their vacuums simply aren't up to snuff.Pros-excellent suction-long cord allows for easy reach for everything that I do-hose is nice for getting along window sills, etc.-a little heavy, but not bad in my opinionCons-cord wrap up could be better, not a huge deal in my opinion for the price-hose could be a bit longer-crevice tool falls out of the storage spot with the slightest bumpAll in all highly recommended"
4,eureka hand-held,"Reading the previous comments prior to purchase made my decision over the dirt devil brand. This product really does have great suction and I've used it for sanding dust, as well as stairs, and quick spot clean ups. The dirt cup is convenient to empty and its really simple to use. I would purchase other eureka products based on the performance of this one."
3,Works unless you have long dog hair.,"This was a great vacuum for our Labradors. Once we got a Newfoundland, the roller brush quickly became choked and entangled with hair, despite our best efforts to keep it clear. It ultimately broke when I tried to dissasemble it to untangle the brush bar. In search of a new one...."
2,Poorly organized and difficult to use,Due to the organization of this book it is extremely hard to locate any particular diecast unless you have the diecast number or item name or designation. Photos are very small and indistinct making it hard to identify items. It appears that not all diecasts produced are listed in the yearly listings nor are all photos shown. Overall rating on this publication is 2 stars or less!
2,hotwheels book,Not a complete guide to hotwheels at all. In fact I found 2 other books that are 10 times better. Half the book is listings of cars that is printed so small you need a magnifying glass. Forget it!
4,hot wheels book,It fit the bill for what I was looking for. It was a good price and easy to read and find out what I needed.
3,Poorly Organized,"This book has a wealth of information that cannot be easily found elsewhere... however, I was disappointed at the poor organization. It is not easy to find what you are looking for, and the indexing is inadequate."
5,Awesome book!,"Love the Newsboys music, so I ordered this devotion book to use with our Youth group at church. The Newsboys comment on each devotion done by Pastor Jim Laffoon. Our youth group has enjoyed the devotions a lot!"
4,Final CD of Genius Charles,"The fantastic Ray Charles sounds frail, even accompanied by the great orchestrations, in this dynamic set of duets but it won't hamper your enjoyment of this wonderful CD. It's all the more poignant since it was released posthumously, garnering him 7 Grammy nominations, too.It is a strange collection of song choices and match ups, seemingly drawn out of a hat. Johnny Mathis and OVER THE RAINBOW? Willie Nelson and WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN? Even so, Charles is the champion of soulful song, and this belongs in every music lover's library."
4,"Even with 75% winners, that's a great average!","I liked this album greatly, especially the songs that evoked my favorite Ray Charles album--Modern Sounds in Country/Western Music. The Willie Nelson duet is awful, but Willie has drug that song around TOO long. The James Taylor song is great I liked the sound of Johnny Mathis and Ray even if I think the song selection was bizarre. Also liked the Diana Krall, Bonnie Raitt and Natalie Cole selections."
4,unquestionable genius,"I was not raised on Ray Charles the Genius, I was raised on Ray Charles the guy in Pepsi Commercials and the Opening Credits to Designing Women. I've realized over the past three or four years as I've listened to his body of work that I've missed out on some gorgeous music.I wasn't expecting this album to be so good, I was expecting it to be just OK. But Ray Charles' voice its fraught with emotion in such a haunting way on this album. Just listen to the sample of ""Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word"" and try not to be heartbroken by his voice. This is great lazy Sunday afternoon music. The Duet element is interesting, though on a few of the songs I wish it was just Ray. Still, this album is worthy of every word of praise it gets."
2,Whad I say,"I first saw Ray Charles in 1970 in NYC and again in 2001 or 2 in Baltimore. The first stereo songs I heard, wearing headphones, stoned, in 1967, were Ray. This album ain't Ray. Ray don't need no back-up or duos or Norah come latelys messing up his rhythm. All he needs is the piano and the Rayettes.This album was more painful than Aretha singing opera. And Willie Nelson, go back to Lubbock or Luchenbach because ""That was a Very Bad Song.""Ray, RIP, brother..."
1,Don't get this one.,The sound quality is terrible. At first I thought the album was a knock-off. Hard to tell who was singing what. Save your money. A very bad tribute to a great icon of music.
2,Disappointed,"I guess after seeing the movie ""Ray"" I expected better. I also enjoy all the duet partners on this album, but just not together. I wondered if this was a ""mix"" and not an original recording. Some of it sounded ""off"""
2,Mediocre,"The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause."
2,2&Half,Ray charles RIP One of the Mount Rushmore's of Music as we know it. this is His Last Recordings&they venture into the Frank Sinatra turf of the Duets area with Mixed results.I dug Him with Van Morrison probably the best.good hearing Him with Gladys Knight. but the Production&some of the Hook Ups never reach there full peak.Ray sounds Good but the Material on a whole never quite matches the Smoke you have heard from Vintage Ray Charles. still a few moments.
2,A real dissappointment,"While there are a couple of great cuts--the duet with Van Morrison is worth the price of the CD and the duet with Natalie Cole on ""Fever"" is suprisingly stirring--most of the is over-produced and middle-of-the-road blah adult contemporary. The duet with Elton John is staight out of the American Idol school of dramatic singing. I wish Charles' last effort were more worthy of his talent."
4,Very nice ....but...,"I already have this item as a sacd and it sounds great, I got it to see what was changed as I have a Pioneer Elite receiver and DVD player that can handle everything this disc has. On my home unit there was not much differant from the SACD but there was a little better sound from the SUPERDISC. But the SUPERDISC sounds great on my car, I play the DVD in the car and it sounds great, I can't play SACD's in the car. The 2 additional tracks are no reason to get this disc."
4,Ray Raves,"This is one of my favorite CD's and made wonderful stocking stuffers last year. It's ageless and classic. The teaming of Nora Jones was genius! I only take away from a 5 star review because of the one with Elton John, didn't enjoy that one."
3,For Fans,"If you just want to get everything Ray ever did, add this to your collection. If you're looking for something, don't look here. What happened to the time when performers brought their best when thay had a chance to sing with a legend. Like Aretha an Ray, or, Gladys and Ray. Even Billy Joel and Ray, Baby Grand was an exquisite song."
1,Genius Loves Money,"This is the worst thrown together compilation of artists I've ever heard. Ray's vocals are terrible on this, and the collaboration with other artists seemed to be more about putting thir names on the outside of the album than actually making good music."
3,"Some good, some bad...","Each track features Ray and one other artist. Unfortunately some of these artists' vocal styles (e.g., Elton John, James Taylor) are so far removed from Ray's that listening to them together just doesn't make sense.Tracks where the other vocalist comes from an R&B;/Soul/Blues/Jazz background (e.g., Norah Jones, BB King), the tracks are VERY GOOD.I'd recommend going for some of Ray's older work."
5,Ray Charles genius,I enjoyed the songs on this CD very much. It has a variety of styles from country to rock to pop and blues. I would recommend it to anyone even if not a Ray Charles fan. There are superstars singing and or playing on every selection.
3,A good shot at greatness,"Ray Charles was indeed an American Treasure. However over time even the best voice will fade. That is the case here. Ironically all of the guest vocalists where better than Ray. This is especially prevalent with Natalie Cole. As I listened to this CD I smiled as I heard the voice of the century. But, it was not the voice of 10 years ago. I enjoyed the nostalgia, but the power of Ray's voice was not there. As long as you understand this, you will enjoy the CD."
2,"Sorry Ray, Really Sorry","I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray. This was terrible. Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous. I'm sorry Ray, I love you. It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's."
3,Overproduced!,This CD has the general feel and sound of a movie soundtrack. I did not find it possessed the quality of sound and music selections that I have come to expect and trust with Ray Charles' name on it.
2,Bland and Disappointing,"Ray Charles was unquestionably a genius. And if you want to hear that genius in its purest, blinding white-hot incarnation, across all kinds of different musical styles, buy the ""Genius & Soul"" box set (ASIN B00000343O). Unfortunately, this collection proves that, contrary to the album title, Genius doesn't really get along with company, because (with a few exceptions, like Gladys Knight) the company on this record only waters down Ray Charles's style to mimic their own. (Bonnie Raitt sounds like she's mailing it in, and the Nora Jones and Michael McDonald cuts are almost unlistenable.) If you're a big fan of the guest recording artists, then this album will probably be worthwhile, if only for the novelty value. If you're looking for Genius, keep shopping, and check out the many other worthwhile Ray Charles collections."
1,HUMMMMMMMMMMMM ALL ABOUT THE FUSSSSSSSSSSSS,"It's all about the fuss, cos it's no doubt Mr. Charles was blessed with talent. But he has better records and this was benefit by the GRAMMY's and MOVIE."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I LOVE RAY CHARLES AND WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE DUETS, HOWEVER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF SOME OF THE SONGS. RAY CHARLES VOICE WAS WEAK. I REALIZE HOW OLD HE WAS WHEN HE MADE THIS CD AND THAT PLAYED A PART IN IT, IT IS JUST SAD THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE MADE A CD SOONER WHEN HIS VOICE WAS STRONGER. HAVING SAID THAT, SOME OF THE SONGS ARE STILL VERY GOOD SUCH AS THE ONE WITH ELTON JOHN AND SOME OF THE MORE BLUES SONGS."
2,A Sad Last Effort,"The upbeat anticipation I experienced prior to hearing this album was sharply contrasted with the reality of the production. Although I resisted the feeling, it was nevertheless a tired and frail Ray who was occasionally spliced into the songs of various other artists and their bands. A few of the tunes were listenable, but this is not the energized, bright and beautiful Ray Charles who cut through the music scene with his own sound. Don't buy it, I'll send you mine."
3,Music: Good... Sonics: Great!!!,"We all love the music and the man. I feel there was a bit to much ""pop"" influence though. To modern a twist on such greats. As far as the sound? This is a diffrent story indeed. If you have an afinity for the ""high-end"", ""You will aprreciate it here. With ultra highend audio, any glich in the studio will be noticed, especially with vinal. This disc has many BUT, not one will deture from the performence itself. They are akin to the scraches in fine lether. I highly recomend this piece for many reasons. If nothing els, ""GOD BLESS SACD AND RAY CHARLES!!!!"" Please keep buying them and keep this flame alive!!!!!! ""Just listen"""
1,Disappointing,"I received this CD as a Christmas gift. With the single exception of the duet with Bonnie Raitt, this was a total disapointment to me. Do yourself and Brother Ray a favor. Get a CD of his earlier works. This simply does not work."
1,Ray Charles unfortunate Last CD,"I have had a hard time listening to this CD. I love Ray Charles but this CD is a poor attempt at a final goodbye. Whoever mastered of the original tapes, should have their hearing checked. I found off pitch singing and questionable tempos on most of the tracks. Most of this should have been fixed in the studio.However, some of the tracks are great especially Ray and Bonnie Raitt on ""Do I ever cross your mind"" and with Gladys Knight on ""Heaven Help us All"". As a whole, this CD reminds me of the Sinatra Duets. That album also had many of the same problems.I will purchase other Ray Charles CD's but, God Bless Ray, I will not purchase this CD for my friends."
2,A little full of himself don't you think?,"Wow! Ray Charles calls himself a ""Genius"" on his new album? Um...show me the papers that say it. Your IQ is above genius level?I worked hard to be called a genius. I had to compete in the Genius Olympics held every year in Boca Raton, Florida. I won gold in 6 events and set the world record in the ""How high can you count?"".This album is ok, but Genius? Come on Raymond! I've never trusted people with 2 first names anyway...this just goes to prove my point even more. I say skip this album and get that Twista CD with Ray Charles on it."
2,His worst!,I have been an avid fan of Ray's for over 45 years and this is my least favorite album. Some of the duets are unlistenable. I archived 4 tracks to a mix CD and tossed this thing somewhere -- I don't know where or care.
4,Grown on me,"This release has really grown on me. It wasn't something that I fell in love with on the first listen, but has been in my music rotation for some time. I find that I enjoy the tracks more and more and look forward to hearing them."
5,Lasting Legacy,"What a gift from the late Ray Charles,as his duets album,made the old fashioned way with the artists actually in his studio,is outstanding.Even the lesser selections like Willie Nelson and Johnny Mathis contained lush orchestrations. The highlights are songs with Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, and B.B. King which brought goosebumps to this listener. My one criticism was not using Patti LaBelle for ""Over The Rainbow"". A must buy for any collection."
5,Ray Charles was a genius,"12 different songs, 12 different artists, yet Ray Charles joins them in their style and does not miss a beat. A fitting epitaph for a great man. A must buy!!!!"
5,Amazing!,This is the absolute best CD I have ever heard. It takes you to a magical place the minute you press play. All of the artist on the CD go all out and give their best performance. Ray Charles was an amazing musician and man. All hats off to him.
4,A warm goodbye,"Ray Charles was a one-of-a-kind artist who always did things his own way, whether you liked it or not. M. Gavaghen's review pretty much sums up my opinions on this, his last effort. All I would like to add is directed to the few ""one star"" guys who wrote reviews just because they thought they were being cute. First, you weren't funny. Second, show some respect. If you become half the man Ray Charles was you'll be doing something. Frankly, I don't think you'll make it.Goodbye, Ray. You'll be missed."
3,I love Brother Ray,"But ... I was disappointed in the cd. Most tracks sound like Ray was in one studio then the guest artist recorded from somewhere else at a different time. There are exceptions ... and these are worth buying the cd for ... BB King, Gladys Knight and Natalie Cole."
1,I thought it said genious loves company...not what a fool!!!,"I bought this CD all excited hoping to hear a duet with Ray Charles and Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Spice Girls, Hanson, and the legendary Aqua. I was SOOOOOO disappointed because this ray charles guy didn't sing pop music first of all....ugh.....and then he did duets with worthless people. I honestly think that a duet with Ray Charles and Hillary Duff would sell millions of records PERIOD! So to warn you before you buy this CD, it may look like your typical pop album, but it's not...bummer!"
1,Why did this win a grammy?,There is nothing new or innovative about this record. The only reason it won a grammy was because he died. I don't hate Ray Charles or his music but it pisses me off that becuase some old guy died all the new music gets looked over to honor him.
1,This things earned 8 grammies?,"What a joke. They shoulda awarded those grammies to talented musical genuses like 50 cent and Jessica Simpson. Ray Charles was a great singer, no doubt but compare him to 50 cent? dont even go there. Buy The Massacre instead."
2,Disappointing,"I'm sorry this is the last of this master's legacy. Much of it is schmaltzy stuff. Seems like it was conceived to cash in on the commercial appeal of these duets than for the artistry of it. Get ""Ray Charles and Betty Carter/Dedicated to You"" instead, an enduring classic."
1,Very old Ray whistling through his dentures as he sung.,"I am a big Ray Charles fan but this disc is terrible. Ray doesnt sound like himself, just a bad old voice trying to get the magic back, unsuccessfully. He was off key and failed to reach the higher octaves. The mixing of the music and solos is also quite poor. I listened to the first song and started searching FF for a better song,it wasn't on this disc. So sad but true. Monster Music did Ray an injustice by making this disc. They should have used tapes from his younger superstar recordings and overlayed them on this disc. Jamie Fox would have sounded better. I was so looking forward to this superdisc but stuff happens. Don't buy it or you'll be sorry. P.S. Johnny Mathis did sound good."
1,What a sad waste of talent and what a sad final tribute.,"The proper final album for the great Ray would have been one that recognized the sadness of his fading light.This album did his talent enormous injustice by undermining what his music was all about.As the other reviewers noted, this album was overproduced in the extreme--to the point of distraction and disservice to Ray's music.Perhaps the most egregious misundersanding of Ray's talent and music was the Willie Nelson duet, It Was A Very Good Year. A soft, quiet, low key duet with Willie and Ray would have been perfect. But the producer, John Burk, went over the top, ruining all the potential with a Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. type of production. This was a disgrace, evidencing a fundamental misunderstanding by the producer of the song, the artists and the music.I could go on and on. The album is an abomination, spoiled not by the artists but by the idiots who conceptualized it. Shameful."
3,There comes a time....,"Great recording (90%) and most of the music (80%) is right on the money BUT there comes a time when you might have to consider hanging it up! There's a couple of tunes on this album that sound like poor ole Ray is 150 years old, it's just not right. If you like to supporting cast you won't be dissatisfied but if not, don't go there!"
4,beyond her maiden voyage,"having heard good things about geri allen, i want to like her music under her own name, but until this cd i've been disappointed. her piano reminds of me cocktail lounge music or ramsey lewis, styles alright in their place, but not what i look for when i want to own jazz piano. and her quintet work doesn't hold my attention.portrait and dreams is a new format for her, one that works extremely well, a muted jazz vocal chorus on some numbers, interesting piano solo work and interpretations, particularly nino rota's la strada, also crisp playing by wallace roney on trumpet and donald walden on tenor sax. geri allen's piano is also a fine match for carmen lundy's voice.this is the geri allen recording worth owning."
1,We Don't Even Have Souls,What is wrong with our education system? We don't have souls we have brains and if I have to hear the Kooks talk about something that doesn't exist ad infinitum I am going to get sick. The songs aren't even catchy.
4,Better than the Arctic Monkeys,"I heard ""She Moves in Her Own Way"" on the radio one day and had to find out who sang it. Already owned the Arctic Monkeys CD and heard the Kooks compared to them, so I gave it a shot and ordered the CD instead of downloading one song. I was not disappointed. I think the whole CD is more vibrant, less pompous and a lot more fun to listen to than Arctic Monkeys -- which I also did like. ""Naive"" is a standout, and I even like the more throwaway songs like ""Seaside."" One of the best CDs I've bought in the past year."
2,so so,ok debut . some nice britpoppy songs mingled in with some dreadful reggae influenced dirges. if you like this cd you'll love CAST.
4,Pretty good cd.,"After I listened to it a few times, I loved it. Very fun music. Not sure how to describe their sound, its unique and somewhat fast-paced rock. I would recommend."
1,Terrible,"Absolute over rated sell out rubbish. Luke's whiney, thick accent just puts the icing on the cake"
2,2 Stars for 2 Decent Songs,"I heard ""Oola"" and ""She moves in her own way"" on the virgin radio and I was hooked. I bought the album with the hope that the rest of the album would exube the similar quality.I was dead wrong. The rest of the album was patchy at best. The tunes were almost monotonous and arrangement/sound engineering was amateurish . And the lead singer's accent, which sounded cute in ""Oola"" and ""she moves in her own way"", sounded almost pretentious. It sounded like he was desperate to make the boring songs sound interesting but failed miserably.Bottomline: Go to itunes and buy those two songs and save 11 bucks."
4,Dance Party,"This cd is totally rockin'! My absolute favorite tune is ""She Moves in Her Own Way."" It makes me want to dance around every time I hear it. If you have a secret desire to dance around your living room when no one's home, and need a suitable soundtrack, buy this album."
4,Navajo Culture 101,"This was my first non-fiction reading on the Navajo culture. I had first read my local library's copy. I enjoyed it so much, that I ordered it from Amazon. Although a little tedious at times, it is very interesting. Get the AAA map of the Indian country to follow Mrs Hedgemann's travels."
1,Don't bother,The patterns included with this book are completely useless. They look as though they were drawn by hand with no regard as to whether the pieces would actually fit together. Making a bear with these pattern pieces would be impossible.
4,throwdown once again,"yet another quality release by these fellows. it strikes hard from start to finish never giving you a rest from the music you have grown to love. maybe enough to surpass their first full length cd , You dont have to be blood to be family, is an album you should all go out and pick up and support them"
5,da edge is strong thugs!,"do not hate this cd. this cd is excellente.. throwdown are native OC kids (orange county) and they seriously seriously rock.. beyond all reason and imagination.. its really pro edge so when you listen to this in public get ready to hear from kids with traditional tattoos, nylon running shoes, black greaser hair, and tight band tees. if youre into rap or youre all popstar status you need to get into this because its good for your health... really."
5,"Mary Lou's book a ""10""","I just got my copy of the book today. I did read it and it is a ""10"" as Mary Lou would put it. They were some intersting points she made and some fasinating stories that I never knew about with her own family and her past. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it."
3,successful people are usually happy,"Mary Lou Retton certainly speaks from experience as an American success story. She's worked hard and is a beautiful person and certainly deserves her happiness. Who in her position wouldn't be happy? Of course she has everything anyone could ask for. And in those statements lies the cautionary tale for the rest of us. Most people must find their happiness with a great deal less than Mary Lou Retton has achieved and acquired. I wonder... if a book like this had been written by a non-celebrity, who would be reading it? Its message is simple, which is certainly a good thing. But in the lives of those for whom this ""formula"" isn't quite so simple and doesn't work quite so neatly, who is presenting a workable message for them?"
1,poor quality,"I would not recommend this watch. I wore it for less than a year casually and the face got all scratched up and pins in the band broke when I was playing tennis. The face scratches much easier than my other watches.. I have a esq, gshock, and rolex. none have scratches on the face, this one has MANY. I don't even wear it anymore."
4,not eco-drive,"This is a great looking watch and I'm really happy w/ it for the price. However, the photos and packaging are a little deceiving...this is not an eco-drive watch. I did some hunting around online and discovered that this model is several years old, which probably explains the drop in price. For some reason its currently sold in the eco-drive packaging."
1,does not keep time - speeds up slows down,I got this watch for my father-in-law because he likes citizen brand. He loved the look but soon discovered that the watch needs to be constantly adjusted it's alternately too fast or too slow. He believes it is a fake. I am embarrassed to have bought it for him.
4,Sensa Meridian Pen,"The Sensa Meridian Pen is an excellent fountain pen for its price. It has a stiff nib with a consistent flow. The pen is weighted a bit heavier on the top when the pen cap is placed on the end, but still feels comfortable in the hand. The only negative aspect I can for see is the inside threading of the screw cap is a plastic/nylon mix somehow pressed into the inside of the cap. It seems as though this is so the cap can be posted on the back of the pen without damaging the pen finish or slipping off. However it worries me in that if the plastic threading breaks or wears down the cap will not stay on and the pen will essentially be useless. That being said...it is an excellent pen for the money."
2,useless AND overpriced,"my husband and i both tried to use this for window cleaning, and both had the same results. this attachment came with the ladybug steam cleaner (which we love.) but this attachment made a mess. it dripped water everywhere, and still didn't get the dirt off the windows.we found it easier and more efficient to just the triangle tool w/a towel to scrub out the dirt. if your windows are already clean, (like after you've done the above task) then it could be used as a squeegee, but you'll need to put a towel on the sill and floor to collect all the excess water. makes more sense to just by a little cheap squeegie from the dollar store to get the streaks out after you steam."
5,An excellent introduction to what's going on over there.,"If you've ever wondered why a language that about 15 people speak exclusively has more songs published in it than you can shake a stick at, here's your answer. the deep deep wonder of Celtic roots smashes together with funk, hiphop, and other sounds I'm far from qualified to judge. I used to live in Scotland and the spirit of the music there is something you just don't get here in the States. Buy this if you collect music or if you want to get a good idea of what bands to track down next."
1,Mattafix is gay!!!,"Mattafix has no idea of music. Big City Life is a such terrible song. Deep Purple, Gary Moore, Bob Dylan etc. make real music."
5,A Great Find!,I use these oral direction-follwing activites with my 5th grade ESL class. The kids enjoy them and I think they are an excellent way to sharpen listening skills.
3,Petra,"Although it's not available as a DVD through Amazon, I did get a DVD version through Netflix. It is probably available at the library as well.This video is about 50 minutes in length and has a mix of film and video footage throughout. Their is a lot of Biblical references and lore in the history lesson given in this video.Not a blockbuster by any means, however I liked this video. It has character and I felt was fairly well done overall. I learned quite a bit more than I originally knew about the city of Petra and was entertained in the process.If you are into history and archaeology then you probably will like this video. I give it 3 stars based on content and some great video footage.For more on me and my work:The Master Within"
3,A place to start,"Entertaining read with some useful information and a simple model for change and resolution in some, mostly benign, environments. The basic positions described offer a functional insight for simplification of how to rethink our roles with others. While useful, the concept is oversimplified when individual intent is added as another variable. In a world of sunshine and roses where everyone operates from a basis of good will to others, it provides a useful insight for avoiding common relationship road bumps. For more ardent conflicts based on deeply held judgments, deception, long patterns of passive aggressive fears and anger this simple model is way outgunned.Over all, a good read and useful idea.If you read this book, be sure to read ""I'm OK, You're OK"" by Thomas Harris, as it will help add important new dimension to the concepts.These two books should be combined for at least 4 times the benefit."
4,"Fine tool, lousy switch","I am only writing this to warn about the rocker switch: It's tiny, hard to find with the fingers, with no firm ""click"" to let you know that it's off. The action is so light that several times I thought I switched it off, I hadn't. There's gotta be a better way to do this! It's dangerous. Check out the switch on Makita's 4"" grinder to see what I mean: You KNOW it's on, you KNOW it's off. And one quick press of the thumb sends it into default ""off."" This switch would be at home on a stereo preamp, but on a router...!?!? Otherwise the tool is excellent."
4,"A very interesting book, much like ""The Messengers""","Ruth Montgomery, a former political journalist, chronicles her life as Ruth (the sister of Lazarus) during the lifetime of Jesus. She explains her story through her spirit guides. I like the fact that she tries to present everything from an ""I'm not always sure this is real, but it sure seems like it"" slightly skeptical manner. I found this book to be very similar to that of the newer book ""The Messengers"" where Jesus' life is also chronicled. It makes you feel as though you have experienced Jesus's life firsthand, and that's a unique perspective.The last few chapters of the book discusses other lives experienced with her spirit guides; I found this portion to be less interesting. It's amazing to think Ruth wrote several books on this topic way before the current onslaught of ""new age"" books."
3,Dated But Interesting,"Basically a list of 1950's cafe society. It's interesting however to read how Ms Maxwell goes to great length to boost her ""married"" pal Cole Porter. Porter was gay and of course, Elsa Maxwell herself was a well know lesbian."
1,DANGEROUS!,"Baby orajel numbs the back of the baby's throat...no matter how little you use. This can lead to the baby choking, making the process even more painful and annoying. Skip the orajels and get some Hyland's teething tablets. You can get them at a drugstore, wal-mart, kmart, or off the internet. They are inexpensive and they even knocked my baby out(they have chamomile)! Smaller kids have to have them rubbed around in their mouths until they dissolve, but at 6 months, my baby still loves them and will chew them up on her own. If that doesn't work, invest in a mesh baby fresh food feeder and put frozen fruit in it. Peaches work great."
5,Excellent Affordable GPS!,"This GPS gives you a lot of bang for your buck... it may not have a lot of the features an expensive GPS has but if you just need it for navigation, it can't be beat (plus it has a lot of bells and whistles compared to other GPS devices in this price range).I also transferred it from car to boat and it worked really well there too... The only drawback is sometimes it's a little difficult to see the screen in the sunlight unless you keep it on a full backlit display."
2,Poor engineering,"I purchased a new one in April. It is now November. The fan motor that sucks the smoke out shuts off after 30 minutes and you are left with a smoke filled room if you are grilling more than 30 minutes (with guests). After 2 different service companies sent by Jenn aire, and 6 new motors, the problem persists. The problem is the motors draw twice as much amperage than they are spec'd. Finally found that out after having them bench tested, which is something the ""brains"" engineers at Jenn aire never did. These Chinese imported motors are not to spec, and the Jenn aire product engineers ""don't care"" as I was told by customer service. They refuse to return my money, or replace it, here I sit six months later still unable to grill steaks for my extended family."
3,A book even dog lovers can appreciate,"This book caught my attention as a loaner from a special lady friend via my mom, both cat lovers. I thought it would make a nice change of pace from works on political morality or economy, and I was right.Like the author, Bill Jordan, I have a long history of relative disconnection from animal planet, whether the wide variety of wild fauna or domesticated pets. (My dear late brother Forrest was the true animal lover in the family; he possessed a rare sensitivity to all living things. He provided the family with the impetus to acquire dogs, cats, goldfish, and so on, and the inclination to care for them.)Forrest was particularly fond of dogs...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"
1,Incorrect advertising.,"The Fasturn ad included a storage box.When the order arrived there was not storage box.When I contacted Amazon, they informed me the box was not available any more.At that point they offered 10% refund, I did some calculations and decided I would return the Fasturn for complete refund, I am stillwaiting for the refund to show up on my credit card account summary."
3,Good Song But She's Done Better,"Its hard to find fault with Sade. Her easy going style works in more cases than not. The isntrumentation is good but somewhow cuts like By Your Side, Smooth Operator, and The Sweetest Taboo grab me more. 3 1/2 stars sounds about right."
1,Lessons are repetitive and weak.,"I've used this series for about three years for a Rescue Mission discipleship program. I love the series but this book is the weakest by far. The eight lessons are extremely repetitive. The other books have questions that stimulate good discussion of learning applications. That is not true for for ""Tough Times""."
1,Gray Flannel Shrink,"This was one of Newhart's best shows, and I was pleased to find it available at Amazon. After purchasing the video, however, I was disappointed to discover that it could not be downloaded to a DVD or similar format--only to a Kindle. Based on that, I would rate the show four stars but the capability only one."
3,Two sided DVD disks?,"I am very disappointed that these disks have episodes on two sides, so you must flip the disk over to get the second half of the episodes. I much prefer a lot of episodes per disk, and only one side. Otherwise, the shows are great."
4,Bob Newhart - 3rd season,"the series arrived in a timely manner. In general, I am pleased, but the quality of the cd/recording is grainy so that detracts from the viewing, but the episodes are still classic and a pleasure to see again."
4,Details of a great old jungle Cliffhanger/Theater Serial.,I have the Sinister Cinema version of this film which is a very nice package on two individually labeled DVDs. I have posted a detailed review of the story and all the chapters and action HERE:King Of The Wild
5,Very touching story,"""Thank you, Mr. Falker"" is an excellent story. It really shows children the importance of learning to read. In the book, it shows a young girl named Trisha who loved books, but learned to read at a late age. As she goes through school, kids start to tease her and say that she is dumb. She soon begins to hate school and think that she truly is dumb. Whenever the teacher calls on her in class, Trisha needed help with all the words on the page. But when she gets to 5th grade, she has a wonderful new teacher, Mr. Falker. He sees that Trisha can't read and that others make fun of her. He teaches her after school and after a while, she learns to read! I also thought that it was very interesting how Patricia Polacco used her own expirience for the book. A must read for kids!"
5,"Thank you, Mr. Falker","This is an excellent book to share with young students that are having difficulty with learning to read. It is about a special teacher in the life of the author Patricia Polacco, who takes an interest in her difficulty reading and helps her to overcome her problem. Students are able to connect to moments in their lives where someone special has done something special to help them. The illustrations are gorgeous too!"
5,Kirkus doesn't know what they are talking about!,One of Patricia's finest books. Kirkus should re-read this book to find it's true meaning.
5,A wonderful story about learning to read.,This story should encourage all children to learn to read even if it's hard. It's about not giving up. It's also the story of how teachers make a difference in the lives of children -- even when they don't know it. The story was touching and real. The book was beautifully illustrated as usual in her books but this book was special. It was personal and took us inside her family where the love of learning and the love of reading were family traditions. Every child and every teacher should read this book!
2,Print too small to read,I bought this book for my daughter. She is eight and has been recently diagnosed with dyslexia. She was not able to read the book because of the small print on the white paper. I plan to read it to her over the weekend and we will be able to enjoy it better when her colored lenses arrive in two weeks. I was just disappointed that a book about dyslexia and children was not more accommodating to their needs.
4,cara's review,I thought this book was very cute. I thought that it was coolhow it didn't take her long to learn how to read when someonegave a little more time for her unlike the other teachers.
4,Good Book,This book was really good and had a great ending. It came really fast in the mail and the packaging was perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone with kids in school.
3,"Thank You, Mr. Falker","This story was about a little girl who didn't know how to read or write. One day there was a new teacher that came to her school. When she was in 5th grade she had that teacher, his name was Mr. Falker. Then one day Mr. Falker asked her to stand up and read a book in front of the whole class, but Trisha didn't want to because she couldn't read. Until one day her teacher found out that she couldn't read very well, so he had to teach her how. As soon as he taught her how she was reading just like the other kids in her class. This book would be a good book for little kids."
2,ok,"Tricia, who wanted to read so much because of her family's love for knowledge,finds out that the letters and numbers in books look like wiggling shapes.Through the years of school,her classmates make fun of her.Because of all of this,she believes them.Then when she got through to fifth grade,her school got a new,wonderful teacher named Mr.Falker.This book is great for kids that have trouble reading and writing."
5,One of the best!,This book always gets me teary eyed. Every year I read it to my students to help them understand the difficulties that some people have with learning. Every teacher should read it.
4,"Thank You, Mr. Falker - This is what one of my 3rd graders had to say","Have you ever hated school? Thank You Mr. Faulker by Patricia Polacco teaches that everybody should be treated the same way.I love the story because it sounds like something that can really happen. If you have ever had a favorite teacher you would love this book.The girl was getting teased and it reminds me of my cousin who was getting teased at school.Patricia, a girl, was getting teased and she wanted to be treated the same the other kids. Then one day a substitute came and changed things.by Bryan"
5,Great book for teachers,"This is a great book to read at the beginning of the school year to encourage a teacher and inspire him/her for a newyear with new students, especially the ones that ""struggle"". It is also a great book to read to the class to teach tolerance and understanding of those who learn a little differently than they do."
3,small,Smaller than the average hardback book and not in a book sleeve. I was giving it as as a gift and wish I would have purchased at the bookstore.
5,"This CD has class & style, that only gloria can give .","I really love this cd especially the song ""Mi Tierra"", I think that as a hispanic I can truly identify with it, and the meaning behind it. Songs like this never go out of style, you can play this CD 10 yrs. from now and it will still sound good!"
2,A tepid voice.,"I was never very impressed with this album. Gloria Estefan's voice is soft and laid back, pretty, and best suited for easy listening classics, like the ones sung by Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Vikki Carr and Eydie Gorme. Although she's Cuban, her singing isn't well-suited for Cuban music. Sorry Gloria, you'd sound better singing something smoother, calmer, where the listener isn't expecting a fiery, deeply passionate performance. Fire, that's it, that's what's missing in her voice.Cuban music = fire, passion. Mi Tierra = a brook."
2,Gloria lost me here!,"I borrowed a copy of this cd from a friend -- and as a HUGE Gloria fan, this one was quite boring. It's no Abriendo Puertas, and the album's title song is far from impressive (I got the single, and I just can't learn to like it!)I don't mean to put down Gloria (she's beautiful!) but out of EVERY CD I own from Gloria, this was a bit disapponting. Hardly any salsa or up-beat music here. But I still love my Gloria!"
5,"Superb quality, all-star cast, beautiful music","This CD is simply awe inspiring. Alternatively sweet, rhythmic, punchy, and fun, the ballads are pleasant and durable. What I really appreciate is the quality of the music and the musicians. Clearly these people know the genre they are playing and have rehearsed enough (or had enough excellent production work) to sound musical, coherent, synergistic and precise. I love the way Gloria highlights different musical styles with several 'pure play' pieces (Si Senor, Mi Tierra). As with pure varietal wines, the flavor is authentic and revealing. If you appreciate music, you'll love this CD -- it's Gloria's best in my opinion."
4,Gloria's Cuba comes alive!,"The listener could scarcely ask for a better Spanish language album. Gloria's voice has a tendency to sound stifled on her heavily produced English records, but here her voice is set free through her natural and emotional Spanish. The result is a passionate, warm record that dares you not to dance. This is a fun introduction to Cuban music and very nice to listen to with friends. Viva Cubita!"
3,Words Were All In Spanish,The music was very good and had a friend to tell me the words on a train back from Florida.
5,Lovely,"This is a collection of beautiful music. One does not have to understand Spanish to appreciate just how lovely the songs are, and the emotions they convey."
3,Works in very select places,"I tried this on top of my cabinets to keep my cats from hanging out up there and it has worked to make that place uncomfortable so they don't want to be up there. When I tried the same thing on my counter top, the cats took a week or two to get used to the spikes and then stopped giving a toot about them. After that they were more of an inconvenience to the humans than the cats.This product may or may not work for you; it depends on the pet and the desirability of the location. If your pet wants it bad enough, it'll sit on the spikes."
1,Worthless,Pretty much my dog just shoves this thing off the couch and lays there anyway. There is no rubber or anything on the bottom to help prevent it moving.
2,Not good for kitties!,"I got 2 of these mats to keep our cat away from the gas heater in our new apartment. Aside from one major design flaw they work great, and the cat is no longer lying/sitting next to the heater.The design flaw is the spaces between the plastic ""spokes"" that kitty can fit his paws in. He's no longer lying in front of it all the time, but still occasionally squats in front of it and claws at the bottom of the unit. So for my purpose, they are flawed, as the cat can still get to the heater.Since these are useful, I won't be returning them. Instead I'm going to buy the solid mats so that the cat can't maneuver around the nubbed areas. If you're trying to keep a cat or small dog away from something instead of jumping on top of something, the solid mats will likely work much better."
1,useless for my cats,Did nothing to deter my cats. The one even layed on it. Save your money. It is really to large as well to lay on most counter tops.
2,New chew toy for my dog,"My dog does avoid sitting on these mats when they are on the couch. However, he likes to pull them off and chew on them. So, these are essentially useless in stopping my dog from getting on the couch"
2,X mat,"I figured with the nubs on this, that it would deter my cat from getting up on stuff (table, counter, stove, my computer desk...). But it failed to do so, I wasn't sure why since it seemed uncomfortable to step on. I had it laying on my computer desk while I was cat sitting and saw the cat get on my desk and step in the gaps in it... They should have the holes small enough where a paw couldn't fit in there easily. For now I'm thinking of using a cardboard with tape backing on it."
1,Does Not Work For My Dogs,I purchased these mats in hopes of keeping my 5 dogs off of the couch. My Lab mix pushes the mats up with his nose and flips them off the couch. My pits have learned to position their paws in the open areas and get to the couch arms to sit. My cat just lays on the mats as if they were pillows! I do not recommend this product at all.
1,Don't bother,If cats could laugh they would have been cracking up over this product. A couple of them even took naps on it!
1,Not This One,"The hole in the center make it useless. The pet can walk around in it.Buy the one that has only a hand-hold opening, not this one!!!!!"
2,Doesnt work on my dog,My dog just pushes it over and still lies on the couch. So this did not deter her at all Sorry
1,Didn't work at all for cat,Great idea but my cat just walked through FOUR of these without an issue. He just walked right through where the mats have holes so to him it just a minor issue which didn't stop him from jumping on whatever he wanted. I am going to try the other X-Mats that have the spikes EVERYWHERE instead of this model which leaves huge gaps where your pet can walk right through!
2,Doesn't phase my cat,"I was really hopeful after reading the reviews on this site and others, so I ordered two of these mats. I put one on the counter, and immediately my cat jumped onto the counter and expertly avoided the mat. So, I put the mats side-by-side on the counter, insuring there was absolutely no way he cound jump onto the counter without jumping onto the prickly mats. He's unphased. I don't get it, but the mats are absolutely not a deterrent. He doesn't seem to mind being poked in the paws. I'm so surprised these don't work given everything I've read that I had to write a review so that others are at least warned of the possibility."
1,terrible product,"This is a worthless product that broke within 2 days. Terrible return policy, company deducts a 10% reshelving fee. Do not purchase from this company"
3,try finding a replacement filter!,"The filter on this humidifier didn't last the 14 days it took me to get over the flu. Worse than that, when I went online looking for a replacement filter, none was to be found. I finally found a place to email the manufacturer, who emailed back that they, exclusively, sell the filter, and it costs $15 plus shipping. It's a ""take it or leave it"" situation, which I find disturbing. Customers should be aware of this problem before investing in the cost of the humidifier."
3,Strongly Christian biased theme,"This small publication gives the reader an account of one Christian woman's journey into her many selves and asserts that her healing came from the guidance of Jesus, God, the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary. The numerous references to these purely Christian figure heads did little to assure me of any scientific foundation regarding this account. While her therapists were more open to the concept of ""spiritual guides"", Dr Lighthart, clearly is not."
4,You just can't hate this record (don't need no hateration - hollaration),"""Every Waking Moment"" is not a departure from Cope's first two releases, as he sticks to the mellow but musically flavorful style that is highly recognizable as his own. But we love it, and cannot get enough of it. Some of the best songs on this record are the title track ""Every Waking Moment"" reminicent of ""Sideways,"" and the instrumental funker ""Awe.""In August, when I was at a show of the Sony artist Goapele, I was fortunate enough to see Citizen Cope just hanging out with the audience watching the show (opener was his current tour pal - Alice Smith). He is an authentic musician and artist."
5,Perfect,"Citizen Cope is simply perfect as always. The album has many amazing and beautiful songs, like ""More than it seems"" and ""Brother Lee."" Brother Lee actually blew me totally away the first time I listened to it, and I still can't get enough. It seems like the song is about my own life... And it compares to Cope's other big hit, ""Son's Gonna Rise."" Cope is just perfect, that's all I can say."
4,Great album but like C.C.'s first album better,Great Cd for citizen cope fans. If new to the artist would start with first album it is a little more catchy though both are great and Every Waking Moment is no exception.
4,3.5/5 stars---A Really Good and Unique sounding album,"A lot of reviews have said this album takes time to grow on you.. and I'd agree with that.. but many albums are like that.. while at times themes, and lyrics can seem slightly repetitive, Cope's musical style is totally innovative and i think he's a great musiciian. This album has some real gems. ""Back Together,"" ""Every Waking Moment,"" ""More Than It Seems,"" ""Somehow,"" ""Left for Dead."" The album is pretty good all around. If you've never listened to Cope, I definitely recommend him.(Note: My rating standard is based on the best Beatles albums being 5 stars. So the closest any non-beatle can get is 4.5 stars. This album taken in that light, is very impressive.)"
5,AMAZING!,"Clarence Greenwood (Citizen Cope) is amazing! In ""Every Waking Moment"", he has a varied mix of styles reflected through each song. His voice, as always, is unique. My favorites on this release are,""Friendly Fire"" with its disonance,""Brother Lee"" with its repetitive,intense lyrics and sound (my favorite!),107 degrees with its sleepy, seductive rhythm and lyrics ... just mesmerizing!,""Somehow"" with its easy,lilting melody,is a sweet,love song,and ""Left For Dead"" really beautiful and soulful! I really like Citizen Cope, seeing him perform live,(awesome experience!) and just listening to his music,lyrics and special voice. I think this release deserves 4 1/2 stars!"
2,Disapointing,"I've enjoyed Citizen Copes two previous discs but found this one to be repeatitive to the point of irritation (particularly on Friendly Fire, Brother Lee & 107) It isn't until at track 10 when Awe kicks in that there is any spark; followed by the beautiful but too brief Left For Dead ... but by then its the close of the disc leaving a feeling it's all been too late."
1,Complete letdown,"I expected to love it. I love the first 2 disks and have seen him live every time he has been in Seattle. I have tried to like it and give it a fair chance- but it is boring and blah. The lyrics are not compelling and the signature Citizen is lost. If this was his first album, no one would care about his 2nd. It pains me to say it- but it is true."
3,Good But Not Perfect,"I bought this for polishing a scratch on my car, can't say it was perfect but it got half the job done."
3,183 Ways to Push the Author's Hippie Liberal Agenda,"Overall, not a bad book, just not what I was expecting. For every ""Leg Stretch"" muscle relaxation technique is a ""gem"" such as ""recycling is good for the soul"" or ""Learn to work and play well with others"" or my favorite, ""Buy Local Produce."" Give me a break. So, while the nice suggestions do relax, the obvious attempts to bend readers to her political views undo all that relaxing and make me want to hurl the book across the room. Guess I'll just skip those suggestions that seem to have an agenda rather than actual relaxation in mind. You have been warned."
4,Vintage Tractors,"Good coffee table style book on antique farm tractors. Covers all major manufactures and a chapter on orphans. Shows a good range of tractors for each make, but not the full line or history. Great color pictures. Above average for this style of general book on antique tractors."
3,An Introductory Guide,"Enfield's book has a very impressive sounding title but compared to The Book of Alternative Photographic Processes (Christopher James), or Coming Into Focus (John Barnier), it falls far short of being ""A Complete Guide."" This book is a nice introduction to some of the techniques a beginning student, interested in the subject, might investigate."
5,"See the movie ""Citizen Kane""? This is the book.","Incredible that a newspaper man could goad the American People to declare war on Spain on false charges the Spaniards were torturing the Cubans ..... TO SELL NEWSPAPERS !!""YOU SUPPLY THE PICTURES ... I WILL SUPPLY THE WAR!"""
3,It's nearly impossible to keep together,"I've built this castle on a table and it still falls apart. It's really cool looking, but my stepson who is 7 would never be able to build it and keep it together. I'm 35 and I can't get it to snap together half of the time. It's either the spacing of the pegs or the fact that they are too short. The towers and all snap together ok, but trying to get everything to adhere to the base is nearly impossible. If it's this frustrating for an adult, how can a child build it? I'm very disappointed in the Mega Bloks. Lego would never have this problem. I've played with Legos for over 30 years and never had construction issues like this. It's really neat looking, I have to give them that. Too bad it's so hard to play with."
4,the great battle,I love Ramparts of Ryousan I would have to say this is the best castle I have ever made in my whole life I also suggest you really get this toy for your son or daugther because it is edcutional and fun I just can`t stop having wars with the norvagen army and also I really suggest you get this toy because it comes with an ultra cool dragon named Gryndel who is fully poseable and has a very cool!! tail and if you do buy this toy I really think you should get the ODAKU ARMORY which comes with THIRTY weapons and the coolest dragon of them all named SLAAN(he is my favorite from all the metal ages dragons)
5,Shot Put,"I received my shot put by Fedex soon after ordering and I have had a great time putting it, although it doesn't go as far as I had hoped. But it was nice to just order and have it delivered as opposed to searching all over tarnation."
5,Sawduster,"Porter Cable still makes the routers, and this one's proof. Dependable, easy to use, even makes my work look good (and sometimes that's hard to do.) Its also easy to get accesories, spare parts, extra bases, etc."
3,Response to above,"Yes, there is a difference between the JM of this album and the crooning, Heavier Strings-creating JM, and yes it should be obvious if you do some further reseach, but it doesn't help that it's sold in a package with Continuum. Just be aware - or have a listen to the tracks first!"
1,TERRIBLE!!! Please don't buy!!!,"The gameplay is boring! and get's slow if many enemies on the screen at the same time. Also, when fighting a BOSS, the scenes suddenly cuts to the movie for the next level without having totally defeated him yet. In some cases, the life bar had almost a 15% left. TERRIBLE GRAPHICS!!!,almost insulting for a 2007 release.Overall sounds are simple, mediocre.Unlockable features suck!!!Waste of time and money. It is a MUST-NOT-BUY!!"
2,Not quite entralling...,"I liked Transformers the movie, but I was kind of hoping for a different storyline... controls take a little to get used to, not a fan of the aiming in most vehicle modes, robot form seems to work better for fighting. Not the most enthralling of video games, I played it for 2 days then put it away - I was hoping for God Of War with robots, but it can't compare."
3,HARD!!,I don't know about this product. I guess you need more cordination then I have to play this game easily. Most of the time my player is running in the wrong direction or falling off something. So I think it's difficult to use.
2,not the worst game ever,"i really liked the movie, so i go and get the game for my psp. i actually played the whole game thru to the finish. the story of the game has nothing to do with the story of the movie, not that i really cared for the story of the movie. this whole game is basically, turn into a robot blow up other robots or objects, turn into vehicle go to next object to blow up. the graphics are horrible, gameplay leaves you wanting more. this is not the worst game i have ever played, but not worth retail price i payed of 39.99, luckly i finished it in a bout a week sold it on amazon got about 80% of my money back. maybe not bad for a rental if you have nothing else to play"
1,Dont use on pets,"NOT GOOD FOR PETS! People think this is cute and manufacturers advertise laser pointers as fun or good exercise for cats or dogs but experts agree-it can easily created a compulsive disorder. Dog and cats have been known to stare at walls for days waiting for the light to reappear or dig compulsively on carpets or furniture trying to find when the light was last seen. Want multiple holes in your yard? Play with a laser pointer, pretty much guaranteed. Want to mess up your pet? Use a laser."
2,small wristband,This like many Tommy Bahama watches are great looking and keep good time but the wristbands are not long enough. I'm on the last or second to last hole. The newer TM watches have a longer band but the older ones are a tight squeeze.
3,Interesting reading,"I assume this book was a scanned version of the original (and I remember when the original was released) as there are no pictures and many misprints. The misprints are a little disconcerting but the content of what the author Mr. Brown presents is understandable. If you enjoy reading about Oriental philosophy to continue to understand the culture and mind-set, this is worth struggling thru, make the corrections and re-read it. It was an enjoyable adventure in my opinion to read."
3,Good book,"this is a discrete book, but i expect more especially in the part of the stability and convergence of numerical methods. However i found a very good explanation of the mathematical concepts that are beyond the cold formulas. Thi is a text for undergraduate students, non a text for reserchers."
2,Not Enough Detail,"Good overview, but not enough information if you are actually trying to solve real problems."
4,Great tool to have,"This unit is great. If you need to take pictures without moving the camera while touching the ""fire"" button, you definitelly need this. The unit works as advertised giving you zoom and fire control. Great for long-exposures. A nice plus is that it is compatible with the external HLV1000 flash unit, so that when the flash unit plugs into the camera remote control port, you can still plug the remote control into the flash's remote control port (i.e.: daisy-chain the remote control and the flash unit). The only downside is that I wish the unit could somehow be dettached and used as a wireless remote control as well, but heck, I guess you can't have everything. I also find the price a bit steep."
3,Basic silver feather earrings,Nothing truley special about these earrings. You get what you pay for which are some sterling silver earrings in the shape of feathers.
1,WHAT AN AWFUL SHOW,"FAMILY GUY WAS A RIP-OFF OF THE SIMPSONS, ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SHOWS EVER, BUT DESPITE THAT AT LEAST IT WAS FUNNY, BUT AMERICAN DAD IS JUST A RIP-OFF OF FAMILY GUY. WHY YOU WOULD RIP OFF YOUR OWN SHOW, I HAVE NO IDEA. NOT ONLY DID SETH MACFARLANE RIP OFF FAMILY GUY, BUT THIS TIME HE DID IT WITHOUT EVEN THE HINT OF HUMOR. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST PURCHASING THIS ITEM, OR EVER EVEN GLANCING AT THIS SHOW ON TV."
1,Shame on you Macfarlane!,"This show stinks!Watching ""American Dad"" is like drinking a luke warm, watered down, generic version of Coca-Cola. It has the same theme of characters, but is nothing close to the humor of ""Family guy"". Face it people, this show ain't no ""Family Guy""! Just as ""Family Guy"" was beginning to distinguish itself apart from ""The Simpsons"", Seth Macfarlane decided to throw this ""wrench"" into the works. Shame on you!"
1,Could I give it zero stars?,"Politics aside (which is hard to do since that's the point of the show, a conservative verson of The Simpsons if you will), this show is not the least bit funny. The promos for the show looked great, but you're in for a major disappointment when you find out that the jokes are lame, predictable, and does a horrible job with political correctness. IMHO, this is what you get when Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity get together with animators and write a sitcom. Don't bother renting or watching this show. And to think Fox cancelled Arrested Development and kept this turd of a show. Sad."
4,Very Good... BUT,"1st Of All I Love The Cleveland Show & Family Guy...What A Shock! I Really Do Like American Dad, BUT The 1st Little Bit Of The Show It Just Did Not Have A Spark... As I Watch More Of The Show I REALLLYYYYYY LOVE IT! Try Volume 2 Before Volume 1..."
2,Will always be in the shadow of Family Guy,"Yes, it is a ""funny"" series. However, it is not even close compared to Family Guy, which shares the creators with this series. The jokes are flat and if you have seen it once, you will never watch an episode again. Heck, I watched some Family Guy episodes 5 times...Sadly, I never really got into the series and after series 1 I completely lost interest in the series."
2,Factory error..............,"I had purchased Volume I of American Dad and I received two copies of the DISC 2 DVD. I also looked at the other copies and they were the exact same thing, two copies of the DISC 2 and one DISC 3...No DISC I !!!I purchased my copy w/ K-Mart...Who knows, but the two they got in from the factory were like this. Wal-Mart on the other hand had the correct releases. x_xJust be careful... It's a great show, don't get me wrong, but watch for that small little error in the disc's."
3,American who?,"This show is about a dad who works for the CIA. He keeps an alien in his home of course it could cost him his job and send him to jail. His son is a nerd. They have a talking fish which is from Germany. I think the drawings of the characters are pretty ugly compaired to Family Guy.This show is alright as far as comedy goes. To me all these adult cartoon shows out on FOX these days (King of the Hills, Futurama, American Dad, Family Guy) none of them have anything on ""The Simpsons"" which is still the number 1 dysfunctional family today."
1,"I'm rating the DVD, not the series.","first of all, remember that the product that Amazon is selling is THE DVD BOX SET THAT CONTAINS THE SERIES, not the series so this rating and review is FOR THE DVD BOXED SET, not the series.so, with that clear, I feel really cheated because I bought this box set waiting to see all the first season complete and in order, because in my country, FX put it in the unregular schedule, normally between 12 midnight and 5 a.m. and without continuity so, I really want to enjoy the series in order and COMPLETE.but when I get this I could see that the season is incomplete and I feel scammed because I want the first season not this.of course I used to have in the wish list ready to order the other boxed sets, but then I delete them and get the episodes for another sources. because these boxed sets are a fiasco, so sad that the series be so good. =("
3,Great Show Worthless DVD,"I love the show and i watch it when ever it's on but i won't buy it because American Dad did something that many of my favorate show do that pisses me off. They sell the show in Volumes instead of in seasons, this show was even worse then the others because they charged the same price as if they would sell by the season. Instead of wasting the fans money, take a little more time and put all 23 episodes on the dvd instead of 13."
4,Better than expected,"When this show first aired I, like many, assumed it was going to just be a lesser version of ""Family Guy"", and indeed the first few episodes seemed to bear this out.I think it was somewhere around ""Homeland Insecurity"" and ""A Smith in the Hand"" that I began to change my mind on the show. That was when it began to show some real potential and begin to shine on its own, regardless of what was going on in ""Family Guy"".""American Dad!"" contains some of the sharpest political satire this side of Steven Colbert and John Stewart. Like Colbert is mocks the state of affairs in the nation today with an ""everything is rosy!"" attitude, and that's something I always enjoy. It also helps that this show can go even more over-the-top than ""Family Guy"" can.Really there's not too much more I can say about this show. If you like funny, sharp, intelligent political satire, you'll get a big kick out of it. If you don't, well... you're doomed, so there. :P"
1,NOT FROM SKYLINE its SKYTIME!!,"I got tricked into buying 12 of these, its got WAY TOO MUCH SODIUM!its not Skyline chilli, read the package first. This one makes my Hypertention go wild.THIS CHILLI HAS 800+ MG of sodiumGOLDSTAR CHILI PACKET 580MG of Sodiumif you're looking for Powder packets of Chilli I recomend GoldstarSkyline doesnt sell non Canned chilli packets.JJ"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"If you love Cincinnati chili and can't afford to buy the cans, then this is the way to go. I usually buy this at least once or twice a year and give some to my family members and friends. It is as close to Skyline chili as you can get. We love it in our family, and as long as it is on sale here we will be buying it."
4,Cincinnati Chili,"We love Cincinnati Chili. I purchased the seasoning mix and I really like it. The directions are easy. Since we cannot get that famous dish here in California, it is the next best thing to visiting one of Cincinnati's chili parlors. We like it over spaghetti with onions and cheddar cheese, lots of cheddar cheese. Yum!"
3,Worth the money if you need a fix,"Not as good as Skyline, but helps the Floridian get his Cinti chili fix. Easy to make, and certainly worth the money."
2,Not the Real Deal for Skyline Chili,This is definitely not the real deal for Skyline Chili. I was very dissappointed with the end result. Taste was a bit stronger than what you get at the restaurant. I will not purchase again.
5,Cincinnati chili at home,"Love skyline chili, but the only thing I can get in the south is frozen skyline. These packets allow us to make it at home. And the flavor is pretty darn good. Especially after you have been away for a while."
5,Can't get enough,I love Cincinnati Chili but not all the spices needed to make it from scratch. This packet makes it easy.
4,Enlightening,"I thought it was a movie and was, at first, disappointed. But after I played the video I was pleasently surprised how thought and spirtually provoking it was. It will definitely give you something to think about and ponder. I liked it!"
5,BE STILL VIDEO,This video was inspiring and filled with a wealth of information about getting closer to God.
5,Excellent encouragment for prayer.,"So many Christians pray only to be heard by God. But prayer is more that that. The authors and speakers on this video program offer help toward a way of prayer that has been all but lost in our day. Prayer is also meant to change us, to let God speak to us through the reflective reading of the Bible. Please don't listen to well meaning Christians who criticize this film for its superficial resemblence to New Age spirituality. Their criticisms are off the mark. There is plenty of biblical and historical support for the practices discussed here. Don't miss out on something that will bring you closer to God. See the film for yourself and decide if this is helpful to you."
5,Too much noise,"There is too much noise everywhere in modern life, including modern religious life. TV preachers and direct mailers compete for who can shout the loudest to promote, condemn, convict and on occasion, preach a salvation message unrelated to politics. save. God says, ""Be still and know that I am God."" This excellent DVD serves as an important reminder that if we will keep quiet more than we talk, we might actually hear more of God's voice and less of our own. Wouldn't that be nice for a change?Cal Thomas"
3,Be Still,"I thought this was a story movie, it was a teaching tool. It was talking and was good for learning.For study it was good, the theme,we do not have to always be busy, sometimes just be still ,give God a time to talk to us. Be still and know that I am God.Be Still"
5,AWSOME - REAL - AND LIFE GIVING!!!,"Wonderful revelation into entering God's presence, hearing His voice, and practical advice on what it means to be still."
1,Contemplitive pray is heresie,"Before diving into contemplitive prayer search the web about this subject.This practice comes from a group known as The Desert Fathers back in ancienttimes. It was considered a heresie then as it is today. The scripture says""In the end times there would be a falling away from the truth"" and thisis one example. Research the web!! Check out the Emergent Churches use ofthis false teaching."
3,Be Still,"I don't remember much about this so I suppose I really shouldn't write a review but if any of my recolection serves me well, I think it turned out to be something that just didn't move me too much."
2,"Not as good as ""Baby Learns Chinese""","I bought this DVD thinking that my daughter (22 months) would love it, since she loves ""Baby Learns Chinese"" DVD. But I was disappointed. She is not interested in this DVD at all. I am also not happy that it has both English and Chinese. It would be more effective if it is ALL in Chinese. Children learn best if they are totally immersed in the language. I speak both English and Chinese, and the ""Baby Learns Chinese"" DVD definitely has better pronounced Chinese.Baby Learns Chinese 1"
5,W,I wish these videos were sold as a set. Our family loves watching all of the Bao Bei DVDs. We're all picking up a lot of Chinese. Our kids don't even realize that they're watching something educational. They just want to watch Bao Bei over and over again. They laugh a lot while watching and repeat the Chinese words and phrases. We really like the glossaries at the end of the 3rd and 4th videos. The moving mouth has helped my wife and me a lot with pronuncation.
5,Love these videos!,"I am a Chinese American while my husband is Caucasian. Although we speak English at home, we really want our daughters to be able to speak Mandarin as well. The Bao Bei videos have been great and definitely a hit in our home. My almost 3 year old is always asking to watch Bao Bei and my 10 month old is fascinated by the colors and characters in the videos.What's most fascinating is that my almost 3 year old now can name all the colors as well as count in Mandarin. If you are a parent and want your kids exposed to and learn Mandarin Chinese, definitely get all the Bao Bei video series!"
3,"Decent, not great","I've seen a lot of language videos, of various languages, and this one spends a little too much time teaching the name of the puppet, etc., and similar administrative things that have no language value. All in all it's good, though. It kept my kids' attention, which is important. It's just not one of the best that I have seen."
3,Bao Bei - Volume 1 Mandarin Chinese,"Good introduction but my 8 year old was bored. The 9 month old was intrigued however. I enjoyed that the words were spelled out in close proximity to its use, and repeated. I know my colors in Mandarin Chinese now too!"
2,better for very young ones,This held my 2 1/2 year olds attention for all of one minute. Might be better for really little ones who are not talking yet?
4,Thanks Joe,"Every pilot has a story and we owe Joe a debt of gratitude for telling his. I found that after reading his book ; it brought back memories I had not thought about in over thirty years, His book gave me permission to talk about what I did in Vietnam withmy kids. When they read the book they asked questions which never came up before. Like ""Dad what is a NFG?"" We were all wild and crazy kids playing with a million dollar aircraft, testing parameters of our courage and ability. Frankly I was too busy flying my missions to know what the other pilots did but found the war stories very interesting that were told at our reunion. It amazed me how humorous the stories seemed after you survived the event. The book is easy reading and has a humorous slant to a serious subject.Thanks again JoeRandy JugeLittle Bear Pilot"
4,"A Story Worth Telling, Told without Chest-Beating","I bought this book because I served in 1967 with a 1st Aviation Brigade unit that flew in basically the same AO, but usually in support of the 1st Infantry Division. I wanted to see what he said about areas I knew.Unlike many accounts that are chronological in nature, this one covers different aspects of a helicopter pilot and A/Cs responsibilities and experiences, without an attempt to lay them out in strict chronological order. I think you'll find this book highly readable and informative by a writer who is quite self-effacing about a very action-packed tour accompanied by some significant decorations (DFC and Silver Star) mentioned only at the very close of the book. Along the way you'll learn a lot about how a helicopter is flown and why.This book will sneak up on you due to the author's quiet style."
4,good book,"Its a good book, written by a guuy who was obviously there, and told what he did without self agrandisement."
3,Don't Blink,"Kelso provided a resource for weightlifters by putting his considerable know-how in one place for folks to read. As far as I can see, however, his Kelso shrug technique is described in one sentence somewhere in the book's middle. Good luck to newcomers!"
4,For the serious Shrugger...,"This book describes more than 2 dozen exercises for the Trapezius muscle. If you have a ""pencil"" neck and/or have bad posture, incorporating regular shrugging movements can often enhance your appearance. Get this book if you are serious about packing on some serious mass on your Upper Back (the ""Lumberjack Effect"", I like to call it). I liked Kelso's insights into why regular Shrugs that are usually done in Gyms don't contribute as much to pulling or cleaning big weights."
5,A must read book for anyone who wants to get stronger.,"I own the book. My copy is now dog earred because I have read and re read it so many times. Since I first bought it I have read some of the magazines and saw other articles by Kelso, not just about technique, but also reporting on powerlifting events. I found out the man has an enviable reputation for his research and reporting. I trust kelso. I hope he has another book coming out soon."
1,Unsatisfied,I searched for an intake for a 2006 Ford F150 5.4L gas engine. What was sent to me was one for a 2005 Ford F250 6.0L diesel engine.
3,An enjoyable collection of anecdotes,This self-published book contains a selection of enjoyable anecdotes from the pseudonymous author's 20-plus year career as a cable car gripman.
4,A relief for a First Timer,"This book really helped me to feel less paranoid during early pregnancy. All of the other books I had at home - What to Expect and Your Pregnancy Week by Week - were freaking me out and making me worry about all of the rare and strange complications that can happen. The Panic Free Pregnancy uses statistics to show the reader that occasionally rare disorders and complications can happen - but emphasizes that they are extremely rare and that you are likely to have a very healthy pregnancy. I don't follow everything that I read in this book, but I believe it's well worth the read for the mom who needs to hear that your pregnancy is extremely likely to be healthy - no matter what you do. This made me feel much more secure in my first pregnancy."
3,A little hard to believe,"This doctor seems to disagree with pretty much everything I have ever heard from my current OB and the OB I used with my first child so although I would like to belive him, it is hard to considering there aren't any other doctors that I can find that agree with anything (pretty much) in his book. Over all though, his book is a bit of a relief to read. Most pregnancy advice would pretty much recommend that you never leave your house and you only eat organic foods and I think most pregnant women (well me for sure anyway) get tired of being treated like we are glass dolls and would like to know what is REALLY going to hurt our babies and what is just overkill and doctors trying to cover their own behinds by playing it safe."
2,"Useful information, but sadly lacking...","I thought this book did a pretty good job of separating fact from fiction when it comes to pregnancy concerns. However, I felt that many of the views expressed were a bit cavalier. I also felt that I was being talked ""down to"" many times, or made to feel foolish for my pregnancy-related fears. The overall tone of the book (as might be expected from the title) is that basically all pregnancies end happily, so just don't worry. Sadly, I know first hand that this is not always true, and I fear this book may foster a false sense of security for many expectant parents. My first pregnancy ended in a stillbirth at 39 weeks, so I am all too aware that tragedies can and do happen. Overall, I think this book might be helpful to someone who is in a first pregnancy, and blissfully ignorant of what COULD happen, but if you are one who has been touched by a real tragedy, this book will be of very little comfort."
1,Reassurance for the medically illiterate,"The title of this book says it all. ""The Panic-Free Pregnancy..."" probably does relieve panic for expecting mothers, but it does so at the cost of potential harm to the fetus. Numerous statements in this book are completely misleading and inaccurate. It may be comforting for those who want to hear it's alright to drink alcohol or other well established risky behaviors, but it would be better for them to simply use a little common sense. Obviously, there are two extremes (too much or too little caution) and the truth is somewhere in the middle, not where this book pretends it is. Don't waste your time reading or money purchasing this book."
5,Great book for first-time moms,"Whenever a friend became pregnant and said how hard it is to give up coffee, tuna, sushi, and pretty much everything under the sun, I would ask why. They never could answer. Well, they should read this book! This book is completely wonderful. Dr. Broder does NOT say you can do whatever you want; just read his section on smoking, which he says is a big NO-NO but then he goes on to explain WHY. Just as he explains WHY in Europe they are not as fanatical about not drinking during pregnancy vs. why the US medical community has their stance on the subject. Everything from sushi to hair dye to nail polish to using cold medicine is explained and discussed. His writing style is excellent, friendly and not too scientific; but more importantly, he backs up what he says with facts (for example, he supports breastfeeding but explains WHY, and he doesn't seem to condemn you if you don't choose to breastfeed). I am so glad I found this book."
5,the best,"This is the only pregnancy book that I've found that actually lays out all of the scientific studies regarding safety in pregnancy. I know that I'm not supposed to drink alcohol, eat sushi, etc, but I want to know what the no kidding statistical data say about these things. This book gives you historical data, stats and percentages so that you can make informed decisions for yourself. I still don't do all of the (potentially) risky things that the book says are probably okay, but it's nice to have the peace of mind when I realize halfway through dinner that the waitress brought me a med rare steak instead of med well or that I accidentally drank some egg nog that was spiked instead of regular."
5,Totally Unexpected Use for Rubber Stamps,"I am not a rubber stamper but I used to own a lot of them. Now that I have read this book, I really wish that I had held on to them! I am inspired by the author's use of a craft tool in a totally unexpected way. It makes me want to rush out and get new rubber stamps and try them to make some great looking one of a kind jewelry! Sharilyn Miller is a highly respected jewelry designer, and her books are always filled with great how-tos and super pictures. Who knew that rubber stamps could be so cool?"
3,3 Stars for price and materials for an otherwise ugly frame.,"First off, the plate fits a standard American license plate (contrary to the product dimensions in Amazon's listing). The chrome piece is actually made of metal and the plastic lens feels sturdy. The lens is all clear molded plastic, but it has 3 ugly bars totally obscuring the plate you're framing. If you don't mind that or the style fits your vehicle go for it. I'm going to end up just using only the metal piece. I purchased the plate for 3.84 shipped given price and materials I have to give it 3 stars even though I can only use one piece."
2,The Outsider,"The Outsider arrived in terrific condition, as was promised, and arrived quickly. However, I simply didn't care for the book, surprisingly. I really enjoy Colin Wilson's books, as a rule, but this one was dry and difficult to read. I will set it aside and try it again at another time.Olivia"
1,Same old song and dance.,"Once again, the Sixties mentality of excuse-making and pseudo-philosophy of ""The world is cruel and no one understands me so-why-should-I-care"" is made out to be far more than it ever should have become. Another whiner on the bookshelf, nothing more."
1,does not unerstand what he is saying,obviously colin wishing(but not being) that he was an outsider. he has know idea what he is talking about.he also thinks he has a right to say what is indifferent in scociety and what isn't. the truth of the matter is that the reason someone is an outsider is that the magority of people think the minority is strange. and it makes the magority mad at the minority because the minority doesn't or likes that the magority is mad at them.so unless you want a good laugh dont by this assuption built upon assumption.
4,Enjoyable,"I find that some of the reviews posted by fellow readers are too harsh. JS did not set out to write the great historical or sociological masterpiece on Turkey. Rather, he uses the fez as an instrument through which he analyzes the complexity of Turkish society, in a light-hearted yet educative manner. My only disappointment with the book is JS' subtle suggestion that deep down inside, Turkey is more ""eastern"" than ""western"". In reality, I find Turkey to be unique among nations in this part of the world. While eastern attitudes may still be the norm in places like Konya, Kayseri and Erzurum, and western attitudes prevail in cities such as Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Antalya, the bottom line is that Turks are Turks which is what makes them, the country and certainly, JS' book so interesting."
1,Orientalism at its worst,"The author apparently believes that Turks should wear fezez (and Swedes viking hats, and Americans fur caps etc) in order to satisfy his taste for the picturesque."
2,Unsuccesful,"The author of this book has concentrated on his own prejudices and expectations as well as on the realities of Turkey -- which are presented here as colored by those very prejudices. The attempt may not be completely worthless, but there exists a far better book out there:Buy Mary Lee Settle's ""Turkish Reflections"" instead of this."
4,A witty personal view,"This book worked well for me for several reasons: (1) It is written with wit and dash, (2) it is not sentimental, and (3) it presented to me a more profound Turkey from the sunny and one-dimensional picture shown to me as a tourist. His impressions from his travels seem honest enough, though I haven't the expertise to judge his analysis. Pinch of salt in hand (this being a personal impression by a non-expert), I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
3,An outsider's view,"I read through the reviews of this book, and must agree that some historical interpretations (and even some facts) appear to be misguided. That doesn't mean that it is not an enjoyable book.A fez of the heart wasn't meant to be a history book, it is about the travels of an educated outsider expressing his views about turkey. As a turk, I had to laugh out loud at some of the mistakes he makes in his travels and how he misinterprets (or over analyzes) some of the things he encounters.What I found to be a redeeming quality of the book is the style it is written in. The framework of the fez makes the whole thing funny and worth a quick read."
1,Painful,"I picked this book up at my local library in preparation for my first trip to Turkey. Using the Fez as a foundation and focal point for this travelogue seemed a fun, irreverent idea, but the execution was nothing short of painful. Virtually unreadable - a boring, dull, lifeless slog.I loved my trip to Turkey, anyway."
5,Excellent Read!Don't miss this one.,"very nice, well written and just plain fun. would like to see the author return to turkey in his books!"
4,A refreshing approach to travel literature,"Seal takes the position of a Fez researcher to romp aroundTurkey during one winter and spring and it doing weaves atale of incredible cohesiveness. Even though I don'tbelieve that Seal as that observant eye of Theroux or thescathing irreverence of Bill Bryson, using the story ofthe Fez, he weaves the geography, society, politics, andreligion of a often misunderstood and abused country. Thefez, as a true object of interest, also metaphorically tiesthe ambivalence of a country straddling East and West, modern and ancient, secular and religious."
2,Same old orientalist,"Being a native of Turkey, I found Seal's book not only carrying strong Orientalist motives, but also uninformed or misinformed in many occasions. The book being built on the 'Fez' theme sounds interesting first, but it is not meant to be simply a travel book and attempts to analyze complicated cultural and historical issues of the Turkish society. Unfortunately, the writer lacks the academic (or seems to lack any strong background for that matter) to be able to draw educated conclusions. I often felt that the writer had a views in mind and was trying confirm them with his observations in that direction. His characters were extremely uncommon and seemed deliberately selected, if not fabricated."
1,Poor sociology,This is poor sociology. I recommend Mary Lee Settle's ``Turkish Reflections'' instead.
1,misleading,"Brits are much more tolerable when they are making fun of themselves. When I finished reading this book, I felt that the author's main objective was to make fun of Turkish people. The book is full of manipulated historical references and mistranslations. Either J. Seal doesn't know Turkish as much as he claims or he deliberately mistranslated words just to be funny. ""Menemen"" doesn't mean ""Omelet"" and ""Antep"" does not mean ""Pistachio""."
1,This book has nothing to do with reality.,Go to Turkey see the difference between what is written in this book and in the real Turkish world.
2,Not good,"This is fiction, not travel writing! Turkey is a very nice place to which this book does not do justice."
4,"British Humor, Ancient History, Social Commentary - love it","This book describes the people, cities and culture of Turkey with more practical experience and humor than any other I've read. From the streets of Istanbul to the border of Syria to the Black Sea, Mr. Seal accidentally (on purpose) gives a compelling account of the social changes in Turkey from the Ottoman Empire to the present while describing his search for the origin of the Fez hat. This would be a great book to read during downtime in Turkey, but probably better before or after - you need to relax during downtime while you're there."
2,Unreadable.,"The book will be entirely inaccessible to the average computer user. It is well laid out, but the writing is too technical and abstract, but not helpful enough to be used as a reference book.It's a turn-off that got opened once, then shelved and used to hold up wobbly table-legs.Look for a good ""For Dummies"" book instead."
1,Fuji All Purpose,These CD's are not all purpose. I cannot download a video on my computer to this Cd.
3,"Light Read, Inisghtful points","An interesting little book. William Heinecke seems to be quite a character and, with all he's managed to accomplish in his life, it is interesting to get his take on what mattered and what did not.Don't expect a primer and don't expect anything life-changing here. But then again, most of it is common sense -- we just need reminding every once in a while and this book, with the colour commentary and anecdotes of Mr Heinecke's successes, serves to do that."
5,excellent and prompt service,the item was just as pictured! Arrived much sooner than I even expected! Great quality.
2,"Cute hat, but it's SPRAY PAINT!","This cowboy hat came super fast, and the price was great. I loved the idea of the tea staining. However, when I pulled it out of the box, it was SPRAY PAINTED brown. The description and title of this item are false.The hat is a cute little style, but the spray paint is a joke.The seller, Andrew Christian, responded quickly to my email and offered a full refund and return shipping. This is a good company to deal with, but this hat is not what Peter Grimm claims!"
3,Hat,"The hat was nice but I did return it due to my own error. This is a hat that would be great for fishing or hiking or anything outdoorsy. I liked it but I was buying the hat for my daughter and she was looking for a straw cowgirl hat for line dancing and a country look. If your looking for a nice, well built outdoor style hat, this is perfect."
2,A few old ideas,"This novel was our February Book group text. It was not hard to read and had a restful quality about it. Unfortunately it did not say very much at all to me or other members of the group. Many of the characters were underdeveloped and there were hints at interesting aspects of their personalities but it did not go any further than that, so left me with a feeling of frustration and irritation. I appreciate that her forte is writing about quiet village life and the attention to detail of very mundane events but I think this can be taken too far."
1,dreary and non-engaging,"This is a book club choice so I wished to be conversant for the discussion. However, I could not force myself past 100 pages. I found the style to be disjointed and just plain boring. I am not a fan of British lit in general, the plodding, prim, takes forever to say anything, much less happen style. But this novel was just painful for a reader to try and care about any of the characters. My time is too valuable with other great reads to pursue rather than this book."
1,"Item Received was ANALOG, not Digital","Argh. Same thing happened to me as for the other reviewer. The item described is a DIGITAL Air Pressure Gauge, and I received an ANALOG Air Pressure Gauge."
4,Tachikara Digital Air Pressure Gauge,"Wow! What an improvement over the conventional dial gauge. Football pressure is important to insure consistency in the feel and response of the ball. My son is a great kicker and has not missed an extra point or field goal since we started managing the pressure in his balls with this gauge. It is consistent, accurate, and pretty durable."
5,"Great shoe, great price","This shoe is really cute and very comfortable. It goes with almost anything. True to size, well made, soft leather. Highly recommend!"
2,Uncomfortably cute,I got these shoes much cheaper than what they are selling today. Wore them once and they pinched my toes so badly. They're very cute though.
3,Its a little off,"I bought this to better blend some of my equipment in to the rest of the Army uniform. I found that it is not quite the right shade of Foliage green but, it is better than gray or black equipment standing out. I recommend a light dusting of the tan to help blend it."
5,Fantastic adhesion,"I don't know what you can say about a product like this? I't just what you expects, pretty simple. Cheap, nothing to go wrong. What can I say?"
3,Pretty impressive interviews,"Not quite as gripping as I had anticipated, but a really interesting look at the process of filmmaking and unique opportunity to hear from directors about their thoughts on the future of film. Great for film buffs, others might not be as intrigued."
5,Clearer Understanding to the Word of God,The Recovery Version is a more literal translation of the scriptures. It comes in handy when cross-referencing between translations and contains extremely insightful study notes. I recommend a copy in your study sources for a more in-depth look at the Word of God. My only regret is that it only comes in the New Testament.
4,Recovery New Testament,Book is in excellent shape. Thanks.Can't say that I agree with all the notes.But I haven't finished reading all of it.
5,The last book on the subject.,"Nothing else needs to be written on this subject. This book plainly spells out the motive, plot and execution and the CIA's obvious involvement of the events of Nov. 1963. It backs it up with the most explosive yet authentic evidence to date.It is an easy read considering some of the more complex writings on the subject."
1,Fabrication,"Mr. Douglas purports to be in possession of ""secret files"" furnished to him by Robert Crowley.In fact Gregory Douglas never met Robert Crowley.Robert Crowley regarded Douglas as a harmless eccentric.I know this to be a fact because I am Robert Crowley's son.Legal action was considered pointless since Douglas has no assets and a trial would only produce publicity for Douglas's book."
3,Short Book for such a Topic,I found the book to be sufficient but nothing that amazed me. Suprisingly the book is short considering the amount of evidence it gives to the JFK assassination. The author just concentrates on the documents of the assassination he has and really does not give you much of his own intrepretations or further research onto the matter.
1,Not the Rosetta Stone I hoped for !,"Please research the author's history, especially regarding thebook (Gestapo Chief...Do we really believe that Hitler did not die in the bunker butactually escaped to Spain ? The author has alleged so in that""work"". I honestly believe in the JFK conspiracy, Roswell andthink there might actually be something to crop circles. Thisnew book of JFK revelations should be taken, however, with aMount Everest - size grain of salt. Does Clifford Irving ringa bell ?"
1,Not reliable,"The list of sources and index of names is a farce. It is an old mailing list from a foreign service organization and nothing more. I would be willing to guess that many of these people never spoke with Mr. Douglas and know nothing about their inclusion as so called ""sources"". Hmmm...Credibility is highly suspect!"
3,Where is the author or publisher?,"I tried to contact both, but it was fruitless. Like one fellow said, there may may a number of facts here, even those which are accidentally correct.I'd still like to be able to submit a question to the author or publisher...."
5,Very cute!,"Fun necklace, but just thought the ""jewels"" could look less plastic. Thanks overall though!"
5,groovy girls pampered princess vanity,This item was soo cute!!!! Such a charming addition for my five year olds doll house.
1,too small,"This product is way too small for any kid to enjoy. The same is true for other similar ""groovy girl"" items. It is overpriced and not worth the shipping costs!"
1,articulo en muy malas condiciones,"pague demaciado para resivir un articulomuy maltratado, aunque tenia claro q era usado se me dijo q estaba en buenas condiciones; sin embargo lo q resivi no valia ni la mitad del presio q pague. Estoy muy molesto."
4,Almost Perfect,"I learned a lot from this book. The only problem is that I was under the impression that it was updated, but it isn't really, and it was originally published in 1962. The only new information is an intro by Shulman and an interview with him. So, although his explanations and examples taught me a lot about light, use of camera movements and the trade of the architectural photographer, and there are many fantastic photos (of course), I found myself skimming through several sections which give completely outdated information on things like proper flash bulb size, modern new light meters (from the 50s) and places to publish photos (like Life magazine)."
1,"Mainly exteriors, little instruction,","A retrospective of the photographer's work, not useful as a guide to how to. And of kinds of buildings we're not likely to photograph today. Didn't help me with clues to photographing interiors."
3,Very basic,"The book is useful for microbiologists and not for chemical engineers since the materials covered are very very basic. For aspiring chemical engrs, please buy other advanced books on bioprocessing."
4,An excellent map,"I had a hard time deciding on giving it 4 or 5 stars, it is an excellent map and is worth it's weight in gold while traveling in the Philippines, but it is some what out-dated and would like to see a new one for 2003. Don't get me wrong, it's a very concise and accurate map, also when you unfold it...the thick creases make it permanent, so it easily folds back up with out any confusion that the usual fold up maps can give us. All in all, this is an excellent map that is a must for you to take on any trip to the Philippines."
2,barely better than the free map at the Manila airport,"Many omissions and errors. I would skip this in favor of the free map available at the Manila airport which shows both the whole country and Manila. Yes, the latter has ads, but at least it shows the Light Rail Transit stops in Manila. Unfortunately, I am unable to recommend anything better!"
2,Bit of a disapointment,"Forget this map. the ""International Travwl Maps"" of the philippies is much better. I went into rural areas and i would have felt blind with this map."
3,Good...great....blegh!,"As a school librarian, the summary then the story was very intriguing. Kept reading and waiting for the punch line that FINALLY delivered at the very, very, very end. After finishing I think the book was a great share with colleagues but cannot recommend as a must read. Try again please, almost there!"
4,"fabulous stories, no pics",These stories are so sweet. My daughter and I love them. The free kindle version does not include the illustrations however.
5,Raggedy Andy Stories,Discovered this kindle book on my mobile device when the power went out at our house. My son was scared so I got these stories to keep his mind on something else. He loved them so much that he asked me to read some of these stories every night at bed time. I would highly recommend this for parents of young children.
3,Short reads,All about raggedy Andy. Several short stories. Not much development. Cute. Quick read. Would like more stories. Good for kids read.
2,Ok book,It is an ok book but not really worth it. I was expecting a bit more from it. The book left me feeling like the writer could of written so much more than what he wrote.
3,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this because I am a Soap Fan well a ""General Hospital"" fan. I was looking for more of an instructional book along the lines of Kevyn Aucoin books. This wasn't it. I didn't really read it because it didn't have any of the soap stars that I love."
3,looking for something new,"I was really looking for something new since I have sooo many of the modern make-up books out, but this wasn't it. If you're a beginner or you're really into soap operas this might be the book for you, but it's not for me."
5,"FINALLY - A Comprehensive, Easy to Follow Plan for Retirement!","As a professional woman planning for retirement, Terry Savage's new book ""The Savage Number"" has given me a course of action to provide more financial security in my retirement. I recommend it to any and every woman - or man! - who wants to ensure they are financially secure come retirement age. Cudos to Terry for doing it again!"
4,The Savage Number,My plan is to retire in five years. I have been reading and studying several books to make sure that I am on the right track. I would recommend this book because it gives you a pretty clear picture of what you need to be considering prior to your actual retirement.
1,Not Up To Par,The idea of the micro pinner is to leave a virtually invisible hole. The hole the pin leaves is small but the dent the nose leaves is terrible. The bounce from the recoil and the sharp nose needs a redesign. I've used other 23 gauge pinners and PC has a long way to go to be considered even acceptable. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Overpriced,This item is way overpriced! Retail is set at $179. You can get this item at Home Depot for $69.00.The gun itself is amazing. Really allows you to manipuilate your cuts. Super for crown moulding Worth every dollar!
4,Porter-Cable PIN100,"Product does its job but design could be better. I was disappointed to find that air pressure could not be adjusted at the pin nailer, itself, instead of having to adjust at the compressor. The double trigger safety takes a bit of getting used to; however, this comes, in time"
2,Doesn't quite do the job,"I just couldn't seem to get the thing to reliably set pins below the surface of the wood. At best, it would set them even withthe surface, leaving a nicely visible small shiny dot. At least 50% of the pins would stick up above the surface How much work is it to fix that sort of thing.I tried it on walnut, pine, poplar, and white oak with only marginal differences between species. I ran the air pressure way up at the nailer with no success. Pin length did not seem to make a difference either (I shot quite a few 1"" and 3/4"" pins).The only way I could get the thing to set the pins below the surface was to push the nose firmly into the wood. You guessed it, a noticable dimple from the pressure was the result.So am I crazy to expect that I can gently place the nose of the nailer against the workpiece, shoot a pin that sets 1/32""+ below the surface, wipe some putty in, and then stand back to admire the work? Such a nailer must exist, but it isn't this one."
5,Performs as intended,"I purchased this tool to hold small work in place while the glue dries. In particular, my wife had me build some valences for our windows, and the pin nailer came in handy to hold the 1/4 inch panels to the 1 X 4 pine while the glue dried. Also, it comes in handy for holding small molding strips for the same reason. I have a PC 16 gauge finish nailer, but the nails would have been too big for the job."
1,the nailer that consistantly jams,"When I first received this nailer I was in heaven, nolonger would I have large nail holes in the prefinished crown and trim that I use every day in putting up cabinets. The nailer worked great for a few months than it started to jam and miss fire, now I spend more time working on the gun than nailing!!! I am presently looking for another good micro pinner, can you recomend one? I have a friend who has a sinco and he is also having problems!!!"
5,great,"I've used this nail gun several times, I'm not a professional however i did many projects,it worked as well as I've needed to.This is a second unit I've bought.Love it."
5,"works great, great value","I bought this pin nailer primarily for pinning small bead moldings for a kitchen cabinet project. I have used 1/2"",3/4"" & 1"" pins with this nailer, all have worked well with no issues. The pins are set with very little to no marring. A light sanding and it pretty much disappears. I'm very happy with this purchase and feel it is a very good value."
3,micro pinner,"worked great for about 3 moinths, started jamming alot. Can't find relacement hammer/driver. Had order in to tool barn for a month"
3,Jams easily and often-,"Out of two sticks (100 each) of pins shot during my first project, there were more than 20 jams per stick. Although the jams were easily removed, it was the magnitude that was very disturbing...normally you may get 1 or 2 daily...not 20-40. The pressure was set correctly and I was using the pins provided in the kit but later changed to a PK package of pins on hand but the jams persisted. Other than jamming, the other features worked well. Of all my PK tools, this is the first to fail me."
1,won't set nails,"Nailer won't set nails below surface of wood. Maybe it would in soft woods such as pine, but it won't get the job done in hardwoods. It does not have a depth adjustment. Such thin nails do not set easily with a punch and you wind up with bigger hole than if you used 18 ga. This gun has been useless for me; think I will see what I can get for it at a pawn shop and get a Senco."
2,Not for constant use,"I bought this about a year ago and use it about once a week for pinning returns. Yesterday it stopped firing. When I disassembled it, I found that the slide that sets the pin size was bent where it came off the track. I was able to bang it back into place, but I think it will fail again. I like the size and shape of it. And before it broke, it worked like a charm. I wish it was better made."
5,Great little pin nailer,This pin nailer has worked great since purchase. I have used it with all lengths of pin nails in both oak and soft pine and it leaves a very smooth surface with no dimples
4,good little pin nailer,"Straight forward, easy to use pin nailer. I have used it quite a bit since purchasing it and everything works as advertised. A week after I bought it, I found it at Home Depot for $10 less than I paid on Amazon. I have no regrets however. Amazon's service was fast and got it to my door in time for my project requiring a pinner."
5,a voice to match the face,"mariah has a diverse and challenging approach to music, which is reflected in the lyrics and feelings of each song."
5,Cool tune with a beat,This song is one of my favorites. A happy feel-good song that flows through. Have fun listening over and over. This CD is great.
2,not the best,"this is definitely not one of mariah's best CD's. i would recommend buying it only if you are trying to get a collection of every cd she has ever made. if you just want a cd to listen to in your spare time for fun, this isn't the best. there are hardly any vocals on the songs, just a lot of club/dance music, and on the songs where there actually are vocals, they are mostly those fat backup singer women singing. i was truly dissapointed when i bought this cd; it could be better. but if you love mariah like i do, get it anyway."
5,Does what it says.,"I had hum problems due to a ground loop and older house wiring. I used channel one of the HE at the output of my effects loop and then ran the cable as normal to the effects return jack on my amp. Dead silent. No hum and no discernible degradation of the tone.Remember, (and this is very important) this unit is designed to eliminate ground loops between powered equipment. It is *not* designed to plug an instrument directly into it. It is an isolation transformer and it will impact your tone if you plug your guitar straight into it. Use it after any buffered pedal or device and it will do the job and work correctly. Plug a guitar directly into it and you will not like the result."
1,Crap.,"This book is terrible. It appears that people either love it or hate it. Though the ones who hated it appeared unintelligent by their reviews, the one's who did enjoy it were even more so. More or less, the book lacks everything desireable that makes a good story."
1,Hmm,"This story about Reiko Hidama being outcast from his high social status is a tired remake of most pseudo-historical political figures. I even recognize some of the country names from an online game called ""Nation States"" (very original to borrow the names), but that's neither here nor there. I guess you really do have to love it or hate it, and sicne Ive already seen millions of books just like this, I'm gonna have to go with hate."
3,Better than what it comes with,This mic helps to stop some of the sounds of you holding the cam and getting a shotgun type of sound so you can pick up more in the audio when you edit.
5,Excellent and enlighten book --- Must Read for College-bound,"As a fellow avid reader of good books, I highly recommend, Winston G. Williams' book, Now That I've Told You All That Would You?Mr. Williams' book is both entertaining, resourceful, as well as, captivating. Who knew that someone else felt the same ways and didn't know how to express it? Who knew that others experience adolescent and college years like Mr. Williams?Mr. Williams' book speaks for itself but others (male or female) can relate to his life experiences throughout his book.Now That I've Told You All That Would You? is an original and creativity memoir that actually put you right there in the midst of the actions of his characters. The author captivates your attention until the next life experience is revealed. The reader finds him or herself agreeing with each word from the author and laughing to him or herself of memories of years gone past."
2,Meh,"The description makes this book sound very amusing, but I fail to see it. Maybe you have to be in Med School to get all the in-joke humor. As a voice teacher I thought it would perhaps provide some brief entertaining stories that would help my students, but, sadly, no. (And it's not that the vocabulary is over my head.)"
1,horrible stuff,"This looks pretty cool. That's why I chose this item for my daughter.But the package was not perfect and it even didn't work.Even I returned and got new one, but so did it.Horrible watch it is."
4,It will stay in my memory,"A father and daughter spend the summer together. At first, the book is excellent but as I progressed, I found that one peticular chapter was out of, shall I say,out of sequence. It just did not fit. The love story with the father/daughter is fine. I recommend this book to teens and single dads."
2,Great concert BUT...,"Audio it's not good enough. Don't even try to listen in 5.1 ""true HD"", very poor quality (Had to play it in PCM stereo). On the other hand, the band is superb. Sambora is magnificent. It's a great concert, but the sound's not."
2,Caution,"If you purchase this DVD from amazon.uk, it is the region 0 version. It will most likely not play on any DVD player purchased in the US. As of the date of this review, it is not available for sale in the US or Canada."
3,Censored,"Bought this due to not being released in the US and it is CENSORED. Paying over $40 for this DVD, well it should not be censored. I am no to happy."
2,Where is the bass player?!!,"Poor old Hugh McDonald has been in the band for more than 15 years now. Besides not appearing on the cover, he practically does not appear on the show. There is not one single shot focused entirely on him (wait: there is one, when he plays the bass line at the beginning of ""Keep the Faith""). As for the rest of the show, you know he is at the left part of the stage, and that's it. The paycheck must be really good.The show itself is much worse than the CURSH DVD from 2000. It's colder, it's not very muhc inspired, it's weird. I'm dissapointed."
5,Bon Jovi RULES!!!!,"I was REAL happy to find this concert on dvd!!! I'm opera/classic music trained,but have a very soft spot for(John)Jon B.remembering him from our home town.I follow his career from a distance.EVERY ONE WOULD LOVE THIS CONCERT!! FABULOUS!!!!!"
5,Bon Jovi at their best AGAIN!,"I have watched my DVD so many times that I'm surprised I haven't worn it out already! It's not just songs recorded previously and put on a disc to sell to make money; they must've re-recorded songs because if you know the songs as well as I do, you'll notice the difference in the singing of the songs. I definitely recommend this DVD to ALL Bon Jovi fans!!"
4,Great concert let down somewhat by mix,"Was looking forward to receiving this Bluray in the mail. However, while I enjoyed the concert immensely, I was disappointed that the mix in dolby digital mode sounded somewhat un-concert like. Ambient sound was way too loud and vocals were constantly drowned out by the electric guitar and the drums, and like what other reviewers have said, this really pales in comparison to some of the other bluray concerts I have, such as Adele's recent bluray. Switch to Dolby PL2 mode however, and the sound is decent. Loved the concert, if only the mix was better."
4,Kind of Disappointed,"LOVED it until it came to credits, where they were rolling though credits and still in concert wtih 4 songs. Should've waited to roll credits until AFTER concert was completely over!"
2,"Crappy audio, save your money","Truly crappy audio; this is noise, not music. Compared to the Adele blu-ray which was a 5/5, the sound is a 2/5. I don't care that it is in DTS-MA, if it is nothing more than a big cacophony. The sound engineering is bad; Jon's voice is covered by the band. Save your money, buy a studio CD."
5,Excellent value,"This is wonderful stroller for the money. It was easy to assemble, and it looks and feels durable enough to handle years of rough use. I particularly like the reversible handle, and there is very limited choice of strollers that have reversible handles, unless you are willing to pay a lot of money. The only negative thing is that the harness is not removable."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I hate this stroller and am getting rid of it. I intially bought it because of the peg perego reputation and it looked good.CONS:Big, bulky, HEAVYHard to open and closeHorrible instructionsToo complicated and time consuiming to change from stroller mode to carriage modeHard to reach basket when car seat is incup holder is a jokeNo hood window so you can't see the childdoesn't go over curbs wellPROS:Good constructionSmooth ride"
4,Kora Kagaz,Excellent copy & enjoyable movie which I had watched in past.I would recommend to watch once.Jay's role is much admirable.
3,it's not waking me!!,"the alarm is just too soft, not doing the job of waking me. Also the radio's always static."
1,Amateurish,"The diagrams and pictures are almost as if a child drew them. Since I haven't been to England or Ireland, I'm not sure about the content, but quality of the book, the print, the editing are all poor."
3,C. S. Lewis' Ireland and England,Interesting but not particularly helpful compared w/ the excellent planning that went into the study tour in which I participated about 18 months ago with First Century Voyages.
5,Porter-Cable PN650 Palm Nailer Kit,"The palm nailer is easy to use and the leather grip is real handy. I have been using it to install storm straps, hangers and fly rafters. It was also handy installing wall blocking and other tight spot nailing situtations. It has become one of the favorite tools on the house framing jobs.The sound takes some getting use too on a job with mostly hammers. A high speed burst of air sets 16 penny nails, in even with a small compressor, 50-80 pound operating range."
4,Fairly short but important learning curve,"When purchased, the main bushing was too tight to remove. Porter-Cable told me where to take it for fix. The repair facility fixed it while I waited. It is my first palm nailer, and I learned how to use it pretty well by driving a couple dozen 12d nails. It is important to adjust compressor to have enough pressure to drive nail completely without so much pressure that the palm nailer is unnecessarily over-powered. I'm happy with it, and would buy it again if I had to make the decision all over again.KenB"
4,Porter Cable Palm nailer,"This product worked very well for a short while.The nail holder at the end of the tool broke the first day in use.We were driving 8"" spikes horizontally into pre-drilled holes on 3x6 T&G; roof decking. These spikes have a head with a 1/2"" diameter.There appeared to be too much play inside the 5/8"" holder for the nails we were driving, which ultimately shattered the 5/8"" holder.Porter Cable replaced the broken 5/8"" holder right away.We ended up maching out the smaller holder that was included inthe kit to an inside diameter of 1/2"". This worked and so far this modified holder is still working.A solution would be to offer a holder with an inside diameter of 1/2"" and this would solve the problem.The nailer has plenty of power and does a good job."
3,dust,Not quite as anti-glare as I had hoped. Biggest problem is on me - keeping the dust off during installation.
3,Depends on the mood,"This is one of Rick Wakeman's more New Age-y albums and as such will not appeal to some of his traditional prog fans. It's mood music so don't expect much in the way of musical narrative or thematic development.The mood is nocturnal hence the title, but it's a quiet night all round. The piano is gentle and pensive, and for me the tracks sound better in isolation than played together all the way through which indicates that the music does become repetitive. I find myself wishing for a few more changes in key or tempo, but I guess the purpose of this album is to retain the mood rather than disturbing it, so I won't call that a criticism.If you're after some mood piano that you want to listen to while doing something else or getting away from the traumas of the week, this is probably for you. If you're hoping for Wakeman synthesizing a la Six Wives, don't bother. If you want a stronger offering from Wakeman's classical piano repertoire, then buy Heritage Suite instead."
4,Second best of the Airs series,"Sea Airs, Night Airs and Country Airs are some of the best of Wakeman's new age music. Embracing a relaxed, earthy style they remind me of Pink Floyd's development of a style of music that evokes color, emotion and a sense of wonder. The dramatics are not there, but Wakeman seems to embrace his muse with affection and great respect.Definitely not elevator music but it can be played for background color in a number of different venues. All three are worth owning whether you are a Wakeman fan or not."
5,The Best Pure Piano Album I Have Ever Heard,"When you get this album,play it on a summer evening,or taking a scenic drive.Play it while your in bed, or just spending quality time with the one you love.The first song, The Sad Dream is the song that quickly takes hold of you and does not let go of your soul until the end of the CD.A great companion CD is Sea Airs.The songs on Night Airs are songs I wish Rick would perform more often.The songs Jack Frost,An Evening Romance,Rain Shadows,The Lone Star, sound as great as the titles themselves.Do not pass up Rick Wakemans Night Airs."
3,Great idea.....terrible writer,"If you think that you would be into reading a book about the beginning of Christianity and the stuggles that many of the Apostles went through, as well as the greed of Kings and Tetrachs, and the strength of one man who decided to follow Christ no matter what, but do not mind reading sentences that are as long as this one, then fear not reader....this book is for you, otherwise i would advise that you find another author who understands the importance of the period. (No pun intended)"
5,5 STARS,"I LOVE ANYTHING THAT EARTH WIND & FIRE LEGEND PHILLIP BAILEY DO .HES STILL SINGING TODAY JUST AS POWERFUL CHECK HIM OUT EVEN THE MORE IF U DONT KNOW U BETTER ASK SOME BODY,HES STILL AMAZING AND SPECTACULAR."
1,Cheap guitar for beginners only,"I've been playing guitar for 10 years. Thought I would get this and put a killer pickup in itand have a fun beater guitar but it just was not worth the trouble. The neck had some fretslifting. I could not set the intonation on this guitar. The stock pickup is one of the worst pickups I have ever heard. The tiger print is a cheap fuzzy looking sticker, under the clear coat. My advice is to stay away."
3,Benji,"Although I thought this movie was cute, and mildly entertaining in the beginning, I found it to be rather boring, and with a fairly poor plot.The scenes where Benji ran through various backgrounds with only music playing I found to be almost ridiculously long, and Benji didn't do much of anything, in my opinion, unitl close to the end.This movie lasted almost an hour and a half, but it felt like it lasted so much longer. I was pretty happy when it finally ended.I would only recommend this movie to Benji lovers, and people who want something fun, but simple to watch."
2,Conservative Parent Review,"My 7 year old son and I just finishing watching ""Benji"". Benji running endlessly thru the city streets to 1970's music is rather long. But parents should be aware, part of the plot shows small children being kidnapped, with their mouths gagged, being held for ransom. The kidnappers are shown with handguns, and it appears the kidnapper kicks a small dog.Benji and his girlfriend, Tiffany, are extremely well trained dogs. But the story may be too much for some small children. My suggestion is to have the parent watch the movie, before your child does. If I would have done this, my son would not have watched the movie."
2,Stay of the couch you stoopid dog!,"Benjy just won't listen. This dog refuses to be housebroken and after several attempts by inpatient owners, Benjy is finally taken to the pound. Benjy escapes and joins the circus, along with long time rival, Curious George. At least Lassie was smart."
1,Avoid unless you simply have to satisfy an undiscerning three-year-old!,"Absolutely hideous! THE, without a close peer, worst Blu-ray I've ever seen. It's not even really DVD quality but, in some ways, VHS quality (and I don't say that to be hyperbolic or overdramatic) with the worst ""rainbow shimmer"" aliasing I've ever seen since the days of videotape. Add in the fact that an ""off the shelf"" print was used, it's in the specious 1.33:1 format and has absolutely zero extras and this makes for the most condescending throw-away effort I've yet come across. Certainly not worth the $11.99 I paid for it, or even half of that. But, hey, it was for nostalgia's sake and for my young kids' enjoyment, so what the hey--it's ""only"" $11.99. Let's be honest, there's very little chance in Hades we'll ever see another hi-def release of this forgotten gem, so it is what it is..."
4,Been there...,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I was raised in the Boston Mosque, so some of it was hard to read about. Who can say if it's all true, but I tell you Mr. Evanzz has hit very close to home.Although we may not like some of the things that the Messenger did, he did opened the door to Islam in America. And many of us thank him for that.Also the ideals of the Nation kept many Black families from becoming statics. He was not able to relocate us phsically, so he did the next best thing in refocusing our minds on your own development and self reliance and off the White man."
5,PLEASE READ FOR YOURSELF,"For me, this book was a very compelling and exceedingly enjoyable read. I would highly recommend it! This book is thoroughly researched, and not just using FBI files. Mr. Muhammad was a charismatic, cunning and shrewd man. There is no doubt he had to be to build an organization of this kind. But, he was a HUMAN BEING, and as such he had all the imperfections we all have.Many facts in the book are irrefutable, and easily verified by independent sources. Of the negative comments I read, no one can point to any substantial fact in the book and say it's wrong. In the end, read the book and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed."
5,Intelligent and well researched,"As a former member privy to the inner workings of the Nation of Islam, I can attest to the accuracy of the Messenger. I encourage anyone who wants to read a balanced, intelligent, and well researched account of the organization and its leader Elijah Muhammad to pick up this book."
1,"Inferior, poorly written, fatally biased biography.","While I sympathize with many of Karl Evanzz's conclusions about Elijah Muhammad, I find this biography both unprofessional and beneath something even Kitty Kelley would write. Regardless of your feelings about either Muhammad or the NOI, he's worth a well-written, honest, balanced biography, but this isn't it. That book is ""An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad"" by Claude Andrew Clegg III--well-written, well-researched, intelligent, honest and balanced. First-rate, unlike ""The Messenger."" Check it out."
1,Bitterness and hatred of the worst kind,"Recent and future events will expose this work of pitiful self-hatred for what it is. The very people who wrote and support this book are the most in need of healing their sick, self-righteous hearts with the knowledge of self and others. A reviewer wrote, ""The book explains in depth why the NOI ... was doomed to be limited to criminals, outcasts, and other folk on the fringes of society."" Well, Elijah Muhammad's mission was to ressurrect the fallen of society. What would the author and his supporters prefer, rounding up our misguided brothers and sisters and sending them to concentration camps? The program of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad will well outlive those who seek to sully his name, yet live in the safe, secure environments that were a result of his work. The Pharisees asked Jesus, `Why sit ye with publicans and sinners?' He responded, `It is the sick who need a doctor.'"
5,Love Ernie,"I love this book. As a cat lover the book captured this cat's character perfectly. Loved the narratives of both the photographer and especially when he wrote on behalf of Ernie!! If you love cats, you will definitely enjoy this book and its pictures. I love Ernie!"
5,Coolest Cat on the Block,"For all you cat-lovers, 'Ernie' is the antidote to all those cutesy cat books. This is a (sometimes) scary cat with balls, attitude and character, who knows what he wants and how to get it! A philosophoer, athlete, model - Mendoza's photographs capture the real Ernie as he is,in your face, with plenty to say.This cat is where cats are really at."
4,Hilarious!,"As my husband and I flipped through this book, he kept asking, ""Do we need to get this?"" and I kept saying, ""No."" But then we got to one of the funniest pictures I've ever seen, and I was laughing too hard to say no again. We bought the book, and everyone I've shown it to thinks it's very clever.I'm generally opposed to putting words in nonhuman animals' mouths, but at least Mendoza isn't cutesy about what Ernie might have to say. The book is really entertaining."
3,Difficult examples,"This book is alright, but maybe you should wait for the third addition before buying it. The downloadable Tutorial runs Labview 7 while the book uses Labview 6. This has caused a LOT of headaches while trying examples, because not only do the pictures not match, but accessablity to files is different, and even the functionality of the programming is different. I spent a half hour wondering why my activity in 6.5 didn't work only to realize what he called a ""Formula Node"" is the book is an ""Expression Node"" in Labview 7. The Labview 7 ""Formula"" module will not compile in this 6.5 scenario. Frustrating."
3,Not for frail built persons,"This is a great idea and I thought it would solve our problems, but unfortunately Dad is very frail and if he is in bed (which he is for the most part now) the distance to the opening is higher than he is! So, again, for younger, larger people this might be helpful but for the frail elderly it may not be the solution for you."
2,Dissapointed customer.,"URESEC male urinal. The product is an execllent design but the materials are shoddy. The unit created a leak in the bottom and created quite a mess.Also the rear cap wore out very quickly and the unit leaked at the end where the rear spigot is. I tried to get a refund but the supplier could not find my name in the computer.The Unit is at a price whereby this should not happen, but it did. I gave it two stars because of the unique design, otherwise I would have given it a one. I have used many different urinal but none have given me problems such as this."
5,Very Informative,"This is a great guide. Not too many pages, but tells you just about everything there is to know about this game. All the missions are explained and all the choices you make too. I found this very helpful since I could make a choice and then go back to the guide to see whether it was worth replaying the game with a different choice or whether the experience would not be altered very much. This guide also explains a bunch of stuff the manual does not talk about.This guide is also great for players who have not played Deus Ex 1 and still want to enjoy the story."
3,It's not TOMMY,"Well I bought this cologne online by accident trying to buy TOMMMY by Tommy Hilfiger from the list of ""So you want to start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon (of which I bought all of them). I did eventually get the real Tommy and can compare them. TOMMY is already a very clean and fresh citrusy scent that does smell really good, and is much brighter than others in my collection already. The TOMMY ""T"" cologne takes that even a step further, and instead of smelling lemony fresh, you smell lime fresh. At first I thought it was a bit too bright (and perhaps it is), but the top edge wears off after 20 minutes or so and the lingering scent grows on you after a while. If picking one, get the real TOMMY (or just get HUGO or CANDIES), but I will get decent use out of this I'm sure."
4,"Looked used, but worth the money.","This book, complete with map, is a very complete guide to Dublin. I was on a guided tour and didn't end up needing to use the book too much. But it will be helpful in the future, as I can't wait to return. The exterior of the book (plastic covering) had some wear but it wasn't too bad."
5,Doesn't leak!,"Besides being so pretty, I found this dispenser doesn't leak around the top like every one of the ""everyday"" soap dispensers I have used do. It looked so nice in my bath at Christmas, I am very pleased."
5,Kleenix for bathroom dispensers,We had been buying Kleenix in larger boxes and putting them in smaller quantities into the dispensers we bought at boutique stores. Then I saw this size at a motel we stayed at and took home an empty box. It fit the dispensers EXACTLY. So I looked on line and found the best price right here on Amazon (wouldn't ya know it!). I ordered a case and that made the better half happy.
2,Didn't last very long,I installed these bulbs and one blew within a week of use. Not the best quality. I'd suggest Silverstars instead.
2,What could he be thinking of?,"Although I find this book slightly more interesting than did the reviewer who likened it to Sominex, I have to confess that I am trying to finish it out of obstinacy and of my interest in Dicken's life. Ackroyd's writing style does indeed get on my nerves, particularly his effusions about Dickens' genius. Maybe he was a genius, but we don't have to be reminded 40 times a chapter! What bothered me the most were the chapters inserted here and there that were Ackroyd's fictional accounts of Dickens meeting his characters or other writers who did not live in his time. I found them corny and unbearable. I have never seen anything like this in other biographies, and I think that's a good thing. The only reason I am giving this book 2 stars is that it reflects an incredible amount of scholarship. But I have no idea why it is so well-regarded."
5,loved this book and have reread it and shared it!,"Watchman Nee has some amazing books for serious disciples of Jesus. This was my favorite book of his that I have read and I have recommended it to friends and reread it myself. It was recommended by Frank Viola as one of his top five books he had read, excluding the Bible of course. I order all my books from Amazon as they have such great service."
3,Too basic for me,"As a visual basic programmer, I was hoping this book would concentrate on how to do interesting things in Word. Instead, this book spends 80 pages on an intro to VBA, and there are just a few examples of interesting things you can do in Word. So I'd recommend this book for someone who has never programmed in VBA before. I'm thinking of ordering an advanced Word book instead."
1,"Poorly written, organized, and relentlessly trivial","My background is in Word Perfect Macro Language 5.0 and 5.1. I'm not a professional programmer, but I was able to learn and become quite expert in the WP macros. I stress I am talking about the language and not simple keystroke macros. This book gives no real conceptual overview to the reader, introduces new terms into every definition without prior notice., and gives what I feel are incomplete explanations. A measure of how bad the book is is that when I go back a chapter or so to see how something I I've read fits in, I'm more confused rather than. less.. The examples of macros are inane... Using the book has been frustrating and anger inducing.. A waste of money. in an expense of shame (to paraphrase the Bard). ."
4,Book covered access; could have covered VBA Better,"The book covered Access very well. It could have covered VBA better. For example, the VBA exercises would have been improved if they were at a more specific level."
1,Spawning a Bad Metaphysical Meme,"I have read enough of this book as well as publications from thespawning organization (SKS) to know a bad meme, ref.""mimetics"", when read.Sadly a bizzare experience by a couple of young middle class kids in the late sixties and early seventies and on a largely male dominated farm in the hills of WVA has secured a place in cyberspace as well as some disingenuous minds in Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC areas.We obviously live in a Cowardly New Worlsd where third rate metaphyics can gain some stock, especially when combining it with the business ventures of its principal exponents (Turak-Gold-Clark-Buehler)."
2,If you like water spots.........,This sink spots VERY BADLY. I have this sink in my guest bathroom and from the very start can not get the water spots removed. I am going to replace.
5,An incredible tool,"Before I purchased the DA250B, I used strictly ""glue and screw"" construction. A lot of time was spent drilling pilot and countersink holes, turning in the screws, and covering the gaping holes they left. Looking for a better way, I did a lot of research and settled on this Porter-Cable tool. It has exceeded my expectations. The DA250B has power to spare, driving a 1-1/4"" finish nail so that the point protruded two stacked 3/4"" pieces of oak... and the depth setting was far from maximum. Toenailing? No problem with this bad boy. Not one jam, not one problem - nothing but reliability and power to spare. This one is a real winner!"
2,Expensive to repair,"I bought the DA250A after owning the Porter Cable brad nailer/compressor combo for over one year. I never had a problem with either one, and was expecting the same performance, but I was very disappointed. It worked fine with the Porter Cable nails it came with (about 500 nails), but it consistently jammed using Senco nails, gouging the magazine, rendering the nailer useless. Speaking of gouging, a new magazine is about [$], one third of the cost of a new nail gun! I can see why Porter Cable redesigned the gun, but I am now wary of buying another product from them despite the good luck I've had with their router and brad nailer because of these problems. Porter Cable should give a trade-in allowance on this poorly designed product."
3,Not Bad,I have used this finish nailer for two years now. I have never had a double fire and it has never jamed up. It has a strong design and shows little wear even though I have used it on lots of finish carpentry. I however wish it had the bounce fire option. When nailing on long sticks of paint grade base it would be nice to be able to bounce along. Overall the gun has good results but I am a hitachi convert.
3,Hard to use,"This stuff isnt bad, but its like hard to use because it doesnt stick very well to surfaces without like noticeable pores. I have found that if you dip the putty into the water like half way through mixing it, it works better because its softer and its more workable"
1,Excruciatingly Tedious,"I thought the book was extremely boring. It felt more like a self indulgence by the author then writing a story that could grip the reader. Yes, I made it all the way to 100 pages hoping it would get better but it didn't. I wish I could have my $9.99 back"
2,Not a useful book about the last days of the RAj,"While this book has some good points,over all it is confusing and does not ring true. I expected a good history but got confusing writing. The authors use of several voices was a good idea but some parts were unintelligible. Particulary irritating were the British diplomat and the victim herself. I now know less aboout the last days of the Raj than when I started. An unnecessary book."
1,Don't waste your time,Very boring! Extremely dry and hard to get into. I would definitely not recommend this book. I could not get past the first 50 or 60 pages.
2,Hitch too long,The hitch is not made to the standard length for the common receiver. I had to cut off 1 inch to get it to fit into the receiver.
5,Dual 2 inch hitch,"wont work on my popup trailer. propane tank in the way. It is heavy duty and wellbuilt. Update: work great on motor home, put bike on it and toe truck to Alabama."
4,Heavy Duty - Could be higher,"This is one heavy duty receiver. It is very well made and works for what I'm using it for. My only complaint is that the riser could be a little higher. I need to remove my bike rack in order to hook up my camper. The hitch doesn't clear when it's open. When closed, it clears."
2,"2"" Hitch","Overall a heavy duty product with Nice Welds. However, I was a bit disturbed how the top tubing was mis-aligned from the bottom tubing. It did not hamper with the functioning of the product, [...]"
3,Okay,"Hitch was made very well, solid. Unfortunately it did not work for my particular application and I returned it since I was unable to use it for my bike rack."
3,"Fair, but has flaws.","I ordered this for my Class C motorhome to attach a utility basket while towing a boat (FYI: need an additional 12-14"" straight extension to do that). The unit is not exactly straight, as the top receiver and bottom receiver are not perfectly aligned, and is not a tight fit in my class III hitch. Also, when trying to insert a ball/mount in the bottom, the fit is a little too tight, so I'm going to have to hammer it in the last 3/4"" of the way, causing it to be permanent. That said, it is sturdy, it does what it is expected to do and was a reasonable price."
2,weight limit,"good for a very light trailor, afraid to tow 5000 pound avalon with this....great idea,but looks like it could fail under stress"
4,Good product,The product was good and as stated. It fit my needs. I attached it to a cargo carried on my Honda minivan. It helped raise the carrier such that when the van was fully loaded it did not bottom out as often. I used a hitch tightener which did touch the pavement when I pulled out of driveways etc.
1,More Than I Need,"I cancelled this service. Ordinary voice mail is more than enough for me, making this an unnecessary expense. I thought this was basic voicemail for a Blackberry. It's not. It's double-capacity voicemail."
4,Eye opener,"A first class eye opener! Since I have been living in Central America most of my live, of course I was more interested than your average reader because I know the scenery and history pretty well. The author is well known for his leftist inclinations which I really do not share. So one has to read this book a bit carefally. But the sorry facts remain being the sorry facts. The behaving of the US in this sub-continent was at least comparable to the selfish and cruel behaviour the British and the French showed when colonizing Africa and Asia. Very good reading."
4,A very one sided but interesting read,"I mentioned the book as interesting because it deviates from the mainstream media's reports. It claims to reveal the 'real democracy' and it does do that to a large extent. What I was disappointed a bit was some of the arguments seem one sided...for eg., I want to know if the so called ""US model of democracy"" is so fundamentally flawed how come some of the excellent progress have happened ? In some other countries even the mere act of expressing such radical viwes would cause a stir ! Not to say that those are right but it is true that democracy as it exists in the US is not so fundamentally wrong. But then, is US preaching the same policies to others ? I dunno..All in all, I'd probably read more of Chomsky and I recommend this book too. But I'd also try to read the 'other side' (I want to read more of US interventionist policies in Central America...probably from the state dept website itself..)"
4,five stars for educational value,"This is something everyone interested in politics or world events should read. This work starts from a new position, that many are not used to starting from. The facts. It reviews facts and actions of the U.S. government and its allies, and then judges what those actions have served to create. When taken without the traditional bias that the Western world has acted with benevolence, it will change the way you look at world events forever. As a personal educational tool this book is great. As I've already said, it will change how you think about things. Some of the statements in the book, however, are clearly in error, but nobody is perfect. Deterring Democracy is also well referenced for further reading and to check the sources of information. Read this with an open mind, and it will change the way you think, if not your opinions."
5,Excellent analysis of US foreign policy hypocrisy,"The double standards and hypocrisy of US foreign policy are impeccably laid bare in this comprehensive catalogue of the abuses by the world's sole remaining superpower. Anyone that is still under the illusion that the US is on the side of good should read this book. Like all states the US is only interested in furthering its own agenda. Unfortunately, as Chomsky so lucidly points out, the near absolute military and economic power of the US lead to commensurate corruption and violence with little regard to the real problems of the world outside its own borders"
4,This book woke me up.,"Call him a conspiracy theorist, total nut, or genius, Noam Chomsky is one of the most respected intellectuals in America. This book details some of the exploits (pun intended) that America tries to pull off as ""doing good in the world"". There are some flaws, like for example Chomsky really criticizes the Marshall Plan as being American centered and doesn't give credit to what has really revitalized Europe and Japan, regardless of the intents starting out or some of the authoritarian beginnings.This book really put it all together for me. The thing with Chomsky is that all of his information is documented, and he shaped his theories on what is actually recorded. An example of this is that if you tell most people that George Bush Sr is connected with the Bin Laden family, they may call you crazy. But the fact is, even the Wall Street Journal reported that he is thru a defense conglomerate called the Carlyle group."
2,Wheat and Chaff,"Some of what Larson says is quite accurate but most of it is ubsurd. For example: no D&D is not a route to Satanism (Chick was wrong) this ridiculous idea has been disproven so many times its not even funny any more. If you want good information on demonology and exorcism go to a catholic source. Deliverance ministers spend to much time chasing phantoms and have very little experience with true demons (to his credit Larson may have had some but I doubt he's seen worse then a very mild case). I would suggest Gabrielle Armoth, Ed Warren, and Malachi Martin as far better authorities."
2,"Was he lying in the book, or on the radio?","Christian Research Institute president Hank Hanegraaff once said that Larson wouldn't know a demon ""if it bit him in the rear,"" and this book supports his contention. During Larson's on-air live radio exorcisms, the purported demons never challenge him about his litany of personal sins (e.g., adultery, lying, avarice), and always obey relevant FCC regulations regarding profanity ... but in the book, they are purportedly aggressive, exploiting any and all weaknesses in an exorcist's life to gain an upper hand. Is Bob Larson lying on the air, or in this book? You make the call."
1,ATTENTION PARENTS: DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!,"Because this is so weak,lame and false that will turn your childern into mindless apes! Beware! Here is a man with no morality, no sensitivity and absolutely no knowledge of what he's talking about! If you want to teach your childern what to be afraid off by something from Aleister Crowly!"
4,overlooked soundtrack,"For Anthrax fans,""poison My Eyes is the best on here.the alice in chains rocks also"
3,"Has its moments, but too much questionable stuff","Well, where to begin? Lets start with the bad songs from this...we have...Alice In Chains, Cypress Hill, Fishbone, and Buckethead. Why you people can stand that crap is beyond me. Anthrax...I personally don't care for people that try to combine rap with metal. Doesn't work. I don't see why ""Dream On"" is here, but it still ranks above all the stuff I listed above. To me, the best song on this album is the song ""Last Action Hero"" from Tesla. There's no question that Tesla is the most under-rated band here. The Queensryche cover and the Def Leppard ballad are both good. Last, but not least...Megadeth. Angry Again is a great tune that is also available on the Hidden Tresures EP."
1,"The worst CD in my collection of 5,000!","This CD contains ONE song worthy of ever having been written and released; Queensryche's cover/version of ""REAL WORLD."" Even so, the credit goes to Neil Young, who WROTE the great song. ALL of the other tunes are junk and I'll never know why these bands released such ""B Side"" tunes all on ONE disc!"
4,Lots of good music,"Maybe you think that is a weird mix of different kinds of music, but is a good one, I enjoyed all the tracks (and if you like the movie, much better). It's a shame it don't have inlet pages."
3,Good stand for a garage,This stand is great for my garage the bike stays where it should without falling down.It also does not take up much room.
2,Stand Bike,"It is made of plastic, a little bit wobble and there's no hole to put bolts when connecting the vertical bars to horizontal bars."
3,Can't trust my bike to it,"Simply put, I don't feel comfortable parking my road bike on this. I purchased this GrandStand to park my road bike properly in the garage rather than lean it against the wall. But after using it a couple of times I noticed the stand holds the bike in vertical position by the spokes. There is just too much lateral pressure on the spokes especially that the bike tends to go slightly to one side or the other and you can see the spokes temporarily bending by the weight of the bike. There is another thing that I've noticed, depending on the bike derailleur and what gear it's in, when parking the bike with the rear tire, the stand might get between the derailleur and the spokes, pushing the derailleur away from the tire. This might potentially harm the derailleur.Not wanting to feel that I've wasted my purchased, I tried to use it with my cheap mountain bike, but quickly realized the heavy mountain bike would put even more pressure on the spokes than the road bike."
1,"bike rests on spokes, not rim or tire...","When you place your bicycle's tire in the stand it only rests the wheel against the spokes. It's not possible to see this in the photo displayed... basically, any place you set the tire, it's going to put pressure on the spokes to keep from falling over. Haven't continued to use it for fear of damaging my spokes."
1,Not a good choice for all size bikes,"Product received was not as advertised. This bike stand is only good for bikes with 20"" wheels or larger and doesn't state in description."
3,Not so much...,Plastic. Too short. Not sturdy. Doen't hold bike very well. Better products are available for the price.
2,Missing parts,Actually this stand would have been great if the seller hadn't left out the screws to put this together. Very disappointed. My first triathlon on Sunday and now I have to search for screws to assemble a product that should have come with it. Not happy at all!!!
2,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased this bike floor stand to park my mountain bike in my garage. The product description mentioned that the stand is made of plastic; which I was fine with, until I saw the actual stand. This stand WILL break eventually--it simply is not rugged enough for the use I had envisioned. If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a more durable metal stand. The other complaint that I have with this product is that the metal screws did NOT ship with threaded bolts--I had to purchase after market bolts from Home Depot (9 cents each, no big deal) in order to make this stand work. In retrospect I should have returned this product--it simply won't live up to repeated use. I got what I paid for--a cheap plastic bike stand. Recommended for light use. But for more active bicyclists, this will not survive the test of time."
4,Works well-good value,Assembly was easy and the stand functions as advertized. The Gear Up Grand Stand Bike Floor Stand works very well for my road bike.
4,bicycle stand,"works well as advertised, but becuase i have 23mm wide road bike tires, the stand does not close enough to support the bike, but it still works pretty well... i use it all the time."
1,Poorly made,"Too light weight to properly hold a bike in place, and the maker did not include the screws. I would not recommend buying this product. It is not worth the money."
1,Bike spoke risk,"Initially I thought the wheel base was going to take the weight of the bike. Now that I have a chance to you the stand in person, I can see how the majority of the bike's weight is supported by the wheel's spokes and not the wheel's rim. For those with pricey wheel's, it's a concern. Especially when using the stand for repairs and cleaning when there's a lot of stress and motion."
5,Midsomer Murders - Set One,I love all the Midsomer Murders . I have all of them that are out. I am waiting for the #12 to come out in March. I wished it was still carried in the USA.
4,Midsomer....,"Always loved the series and really missed it....glad to find an ""old"" friend...and my new laptop does a great job of playing my old favorites..."
5,Great British mysteries,"I discovered this series while bored during bad weather recently. I decided to `TiVo' it, but then decided that I wanted the DVD's for myself after finding them to be incredibly humorous, suspenseful and not at all predictable.The main characters are believable, humorous and very well written and acted. The stories are as well, without the usual ability to figure out `who-done-it' almost as soon as the crime has been committed.My only complaint would be that, as they are two-hour episodes, they are rather expensive to purchase. Only 4 episodes in a `set' and there are at least 20 sets!It will take me awhile to get them all, but as I have become addicted to them, I will manage somehow!"
5,Absolutely splendid,"Caroline Graham novels are perfect for the small screen, and the BBC has done a perfect job with them in these four films. The scripts are excellent, the casting superb, and the acting and directing are equally spectacular. Inspector Barnaby is appealing, and the glimpses of his family life give these DVDs a depth rarely found in television productions. The themes are serious, and the crimes, while not overly gory, are not trivialized either.These are perfect for anyone who likes a good mystery. They are village mysteries, but not what I would consider ""cozy,"" in that good people can get hurt. They are riveting, and after each one it takes a while for my heart beat to return to normal!"
3,It's good British Mystery - but it's not Caroline Graham,"I discovered the wonderful world of Midsomer in the pages of Caroline Graham's excellently crafted novels. These films are based on the characters she created and NOT on any of the books she wrote. Although enjoyable, if you are looking for her books come to life you will be disappointed. Her plots are intricate and her characters a joy to know. I cannot muster the same enthusiasm for their film counterparts. Please, watch and enjoy this series and then go find Graham's novels and REALLY enjoy a well done mystery."
5,"First Rate Acting, Writing and Production","Very enjoyable detective series done with high production values, and superb scripts.If you enjoy this genre, then this will get you hooked, and if you have seen some of the TV edits of this show, then the full versions on these discs will be very appealing.Overall, this is a very Family friendly drama. Nothing excessive, explicit or non-family, and very appealing for even the non-anglophile.A First rate series. Season one( set one) is a very good start, and anyone familiar with British TV series will recognise many of the supporting actors who put on an excellent performance."
1,No Closed-Caption?,"British TV shown in the US is usually superior to American-made drama. Unfortunately the fact that the British tend to mumble so much, yet seem to usually refuse to have Closed Captioning on their DVDs, surely limits sales.The British are likely *never* to speak clearly (at least not to American-English ""ears""), but they certainly can *write* clearly, e.g., in Closed Captioning."
2,To Dark to View,One of the DVD's ( Deaths Shadow)is so dark it is almost impossible to see. The others in the set are not as bad. I have four of the Midsomer series and this is the only one with problems.Told Amazon about the problem and they told me to send it back at no cost and a replacement was on the way the same day!! Awesome service that cannot be beat anywhere on the web!!!Amazon gets a 5 star for their care and service.
2,Beyond Boring,"My husband and I just hated this series. We found it beyond boring, and I was so disappointed, because it was expensive to buy and ship. My mother, aunt, and older sister really enjoyed it though, and have watched the entire series on television. I wouldnt recommend it. At all!"
1,Just Awful,"This is a dreadfully plotted and dull affair. Avoid. Dull stories. Dull characters. The setting is nice, but that's it. If you like Foyle's War, I advise you to stay away from this one. Reminiscent of Murder She Wrote."
3,Midsomer Murders: Set One.,"Bought this set in order to round out our collection of Agatha Christie detective movies. We've already been through all the Poirot's Amazon has to offer with David Suchet as the master. And we have all the Miss Marples we wanted Only the Joan Hixon movies) and were looking for something more. We also have all the Inspector Lewis movies there and just bought the complete set of Chief Inspector Morse DVD's, and we just recorded the Jackson Brodie movies off Masterpiece. So we're pretty well into the British detective mysteries and thought we'd give this a look.We were a little disappointed in Barnaby. Plots are a little harder to follow than we were used to and the fictitious Midsomer County, although picturesque in its own way, pales in comparison to the magnificence of Oxford and Edinburgh as a backdrop. We were planning on buying the rest of the Barnaby movies but will probably look at other similar DVDs before we do."
5,I Own Every Episode And Would Buy Any More They May Comet Out With,"I have bought every episode and wish there were still more. DCI Barnaby, who I LOVE, went through 4 DIs, and every time, I was afraid I'd miss the present DI so much that the show just wouldn't be the same. But it was, and it was always fantastic. It is a world I wish I lived in. I bought all the dvds about a year and a half ago, to escape the American election and everything around it. I turned off the news and turned on Midsomer Murders. Life was peaceful and calm and interesting. If you want to take a break from the real world and hang out with some genuinely interesting, uncomplicated people, tune in to Midsomer Murders and tune out of the news. Very good therapy. Makes you long for a simple life with simple people. These stories are interesting, funny, sad, well written, well acted, I give it a 12 on a scale of 10."
1,"Jargon, jargon, jargon",What a mishmash of meaningless words and phrases. All you have to do is read the five-star review the author gave himself (ahem!) to get the flavor of this tract. The Answer to the Question is Not for Me.
1,$90 a pack?,"this is a little misleading. You think you are receiving the whole box, you are getting one pack. You can get the hobby box with 18 packs for $45.00 on e-bay."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF THIS SELLER!!!,"ATTENTION AMAZON: THIS SELLER NEEDS TO BE BANNED PERMANENTLY!!!!!!!!Extremely misleading advertiser...claims you save $85 then sends you a SINGLE $5 pack of cards! To top it off, I practically had to beg to get it shipped.ATTENTION AMAZON: THIS SELLER NEEDS TO BE BANNED PERMANENTLY!!!!!!!!"
2,I am disappointed.,"For the most part I have to say that I am pretty disappointed with this book.The positive: The author does a good job of discussing how to fish different presentations for redfish.The negative: I wanted to learn more about how to find redfish. I would like to have seen discussions of the following: the life cycle of the redfish and how redfish are affected by seasons, time of day, tides, moon phase, water depth, how to read the water, etc, I expected more!"
2,The Redfish Book,"This is an older book, much of the information is basic and sometimes obsolete, due to the equipment now used and that hurricanes and time have changed some areas. I will look this book over and then put it away or sell it."
2,i didn't get it,"reading this book, i thought i would become absorbed by it sometime but it never happened... it just wasn't a book that would satisfy me.. it was.... dissapointing"
4,A nice read...,"McBride does a good job of keeping us engaged with characters who find themselves in a desperate situation. This one made me buy The Color of Water (which is a wonderful read--truly inspirational). Miracle's characters are confronted with tough choices from start to finish and ultimately, none of them falter. A nice read and well worth the price of admission."
2,very disappointing,"I'd been meaning to read this for years, and since the movie is due for release soon, I thought I better hurry. This book was totally lost on me. What was the miracle? I won't spoil it for those who haven't read yet, but that kind of power, divine intervention..I could do without. The aftermath was bleak and unfulfilling for the reader and the characters. I got the feeling McBride didn't know what the end should be. It opens with a great hook..Hector's cryptic words ""I know"" and finished with my own, ""who cares?"" The characters were cliche, the language wasn't true to the time period, and the writing wasn't that great. I'm sorry, Mr. McBride, but I will try your memoir."
3,"Well, yes but...","I so, so wanted to like this book. I heard a radio interview with the author and it sounded such a facinating plot, combining the war in Italy, the Buffalo soldiers and kindness to a child - a sort of nativity story for our times. In the end, I was a bit disappointed. I had to read some parts twice to see what the author was getting at. Somehow I found it hard to visualise the situation. And Train is a bit of a cliche."
3,"Loved the movie, tolerated the book","First, I found Tullio Bertini's ""I WAS THERE!"" review fascinating, but toward the end of the review, he mentions the disparity between Italian electrics and US. That's just one of many errors in this book. Of course, this is a novel, but that's no excuse for factual errors, such as portraying Gen. (George) Marshall as a field commander, where I think the author meant to say Eisenhower and the author's repeated invention of an ""80mm howitzer"". While the errors aren't as frustrating as in the excruciatingGrandfather's Tale: The Tale of a German Sniperthey are a bit on the glaring side. The book I read was the hardcover edition. Hopefully proofreaders fixed the mistakes in the movie tie-in."
5,Miracle At St. Anna,"I did read this book recently, but had to buy it elsewhere because it NEVER arrived from Amazon. Would someone please contact me about getting my money back?By the way, this was a great book! I was in Italy at the time, in Tuscany, and it was very relevant. A powerful and poignant story of WW II."
3,Needs the strong voice of his mother,"A compelling story with fascinating insights on what it was like to be an African American in the US army in WWII-- fighting for freedoms some black soldiers had often never experienced in the US. Had shades of Graham Swift's _Waterland_ in the historical asides about the Florentine sculpture Train carried and the origins of the Italian village. Wish there had been a character with the strong voice of his mother in the _Color of Water_, but that might be the difference between fiction and non fiction."
5,the power of love,I was thoroughl enraptured with this book and unable to put it down.James McBride's novel of bigotry and hate and the ability of some to conquer these evils to find love and miracles was truly amazing. Man's inhumanity to man was so poignantly portrayed and brought attention to a subject of great distaste to the Army - their treatment of African Americans during WWII- the Buffalo Division managed to distinguish themselves despite the powers that controlled them. The triumph of the human spirit is brillantly captured in this finely written novel. A must read.
5,captures you at page 1.,"i couldn't put the book down. if you know the movie, you'll know the book. i enjoyed the book over the movie. well written. recommended."
1,WRONG description,"Amazon refuses to correct this ad, the cost is PER FOOT, not for a full roll. MacLendons gets calls 3 times day about these orders, was fully apologetic and encouraged me to complain to Amazon to fix the ad and use the correct description. They also offered a full refund."
5,the way to go for large kitchen shelf lining,I set up a cutting station and did the whole new kitchen of upper and lower cabinets. The width allowed a single sheet coverage on the base rollouts (bonus) and bathroom vanity cabinet bottoms as well. There's even a bit left over that I'll use for boots in the hall closet.
4,Ideal Shelf Liner,"I truly like the product. It took awhile to hear about the processing of the order. I guess that's because it had to be shipped all the way across the US. Otherwise, I am more than pleased with this. It's great because it's wide enough to cover my deep drawers. There is plenty to use in all our drawers and cupboards. Was concerned that it may slip on the shelves, but the flat side holds well onto the surface, and there is no issue with slippage. It's perfect for my new kitchen."
5,Look no further,Easy to cut to the size you need b/c it has grooves just about every 1/8 of an inch. Just follow the line - it's as simple as that.A heavy-duty liner.The clear version of this lets the base shelf color show through - this is especially nice if you don't want to introduce another solid color into the shelving scheme you have (be it open or closed).Removes easily for cleaning.Do the math on your shelving needs and you will see how far this roll goes.
2,Made in China,It does not feel like there is enough coating on them.These are marked as made in China. Now my proudly USA built HyLoft storage rack has these made in China hangers.
4,Hyloft hooks,"Quality product. I've had no problems at all. It seems a bit expensive, but they won't fail at all. Recommended."
4,Ordered wrong color,"I have the hammered metal (gray) shelves, these are white. Wish I'd known they made white shelves. Contacted the manufacturer and found out that Lowes is the only retailer for the gray and they don't carry the accesories. Nice. Anyhow, seems like they'd work well so back ordered them for a significantly higher price."
4,Simple to use and effective,"These hangers are very simple to add to the shelf units and perform as expected. A word of caution, if you need to maintain a smooth shelf surface you will lose it with these hangers as they do lay on top of the shelf itself everso slightly."
5,A GOOD BOOK,"This is one of the best books I have read on the Civil War in Louisiana. By focusing on the character and motivation of the individuals involved, it sheds new light on this often ignored part of the Civil War. Of interest to me, it explains the political reasons why some events happened the way they did. This book also reveals some unsavory aspects of the war that are sometimes glossed over by historians--like trading with the enemy and atrocities commited by both North and South. Although short on detail in some areas, the book does cover a lot of territory in a style that is fast moving and easy to read. If I had criticism, it would be the absence of maps to illusrate troop movements and the various battles. Everything considered, I liked it and would recommend it to anyone interested in the war west of the Mississippi."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I found this book a terrible disappointment. The author jumps back and forth through time to the point of complete confusion. It is also poorly researched and inaccurate. Imagine my surprise when the author states that Fort Donnelson was positioned near the point where the Cumberland River empties into the Mississippi River. The Cumberland river empties into the Ohio River and no where near where Fort Donnelson was located. The author, a southerner, wants the reader to believe that the Civil War was caused by social discord between Puritans and Celts. Slavery, in his view, slavery was not a cause at all."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I never saw Checkmate when it originally aired, but it sounded interesting, plus someone recommended it, so I took a chance.First off, the picture and sound quality on this set is horrible! Personally, I find it criminal that anyone would have the audacity to release something this bad, let alone sell it at a price comparable to other shows that have pristine production qualities.Secondly, aside from the unacceptable production quality, the show itself was dull and uninteresting. I cannot recall a single episode that I found to be especially good. When it comes to private eye type shows, there are so many others that are way, way better in every respect, i.e., writing, acting, directing and guest stars. I can see why this show did not last long on the air."
4,Checkmate-the series,"I recommend this package to all fans of vintage TV. This is, in my opinion one of the better mystery-adventure series of the time.Intelligent format with the checkmate characters, and well done stories and dialogue, scenes from the time around San Francisco. Of course, I enjoy the format of the 4 act play.However don't expect HD quality we've become accustomed to. The film has been cleaned up but there will be some unavoidable imperfections. There are some cuts that cause a few gaps. But all in all, I highly recommend this family friendly mystery series."
4,"Great Series, Some Episodes Cut, Picture Quality Average at best","I love this show. I love this set. The price is great. But I disagree with those who give the picture quality a B+ or even a B-. For me, on average, this is C+ material at best. I realize I am spoiled by the pristine transfers that for so long came from Paramount; even so, I had hoped the picture quality here would be better, even by just a little bit. I am also saddened that not every episode is presented in its complete form. The editing doesn't look too bad, and I am so happy to see this beloved show I can forgive these issues after taking off one star from my rating.In my opinion, if you're not a fan of this show you should be, and if you are a fan, the pros (having this series at last!) outweigh the cons I mentioned above.I am glad I bought the set. You will be too."
1,Checkmate Quality Review,"Checkmate was one of my favorite TV shows. I saw the complete series was available for purchase and I jumped at the chance to own it. I was deeply disappointed in the quality of the video, it was obviously not remastered. I have purchased other vintage TV series, Alfred Hitchcock TV series for example and I found the quality to be excellent. Timeless puts a disclaimer about the quality at the beginning of the video but I do not believe that releases them from the responsibility to produce a quality product. Hope to never purchase a video put out by Timeless again."
3,A Warrior's Kiss,"While I liked the characters in this book, I found them second rate.The hero just seemed to lack something. He came across as weak and immature to me. And as for the heroine, I couldn't shake the feeling that she'd probably slept with every man she'd encountered. I don't mind that she wasn't a virgin, but I couldn't understand if she loved the hero so much and since her childhood, why would she give her ""favors"" so freely?"
2,Speakerphone mic not sensitive enough,"A couple bad things about this phone. People on the other side of the speakerphone complain that I'm too soft even though I'm speaking normally. Also, you cannot switch from speaker phone to receiver simply by picking up the receiver."
1,THIS TOOL HAS A SERIOUS SAFETY FLAW,"The Porter-Cable router, while robustly built, has as its primary weakness a collet that does not adequately grip the shafts of bits. I expereienced a recent incident where a properly seated and tightened rabbeting bit came loose and was propelled at a very high velocity. The bit glanced off the router base, struck the workpiece, and ended up being lodged in the ground. Fortunately no one was hurt! Previous to this ""incident,"" the collet would fail to release bits, requiring a great amount of hand force to insert or remove the bits. Yet the same collet will not hold a bit in place during rotation.Due to this substantial weakness in the design, I cannot give more than a one star rating of this router. Run like hell from this one. A user would be better served spending his/her money on DeWalt or Bosch. Even my cheap $80 Ryobi has never presented any safety issues like the Porter-Cable."
1,Porter Cable 693 VSPK,"I recently purchased one of these routers from you. I find that this is one of the most user unfriendly routers I have ever purchased, and I have five from Ryobi to Chacago machine. Right now my knuckles are bleeding from changing the bit. Had I known that you have to remove the entire motor from the housing and use two wrenches just to change the bit, and then put the whole thing back together, I would have never bought it. Also the adjusting mechanism is a joke. To rate it one star is over rating it. I assure you if this is an example of Porter Cable products I will never buy another."
1,Can no longer get parts,Before Porter Cable sold their name this was a great pneumatic company with excellant service. Now its just junk. If it breaks don't bother trying to fix it just trash it and buy the cheaps thing you can find and junk it when it finally breaks. The FN250A by the orginal company Porter Cable was a fairly good nailer.
1,Not What People Think,"Porter Cable needs to stay out of the nail gun business. After buying the combo pack, I gave away the gun after the first day. It was the worst Ive ever used. As a professional finish carpenter and door hanger, the ""wire"" nails just doesnt have the strength or grab needed for running trim or hanging doors. Out of the box a small screw needs to be removed before even trying to shoot 2-1/2"" nails which are the most common in this trade. I have used Senco, Bostich (which I think are the best), Airy etc... My advice is not to even bother with this gun."
2,the hammer,"This is the first power nailer Iv'e used....it beats the heck out of a hammer!! ..but the ""sights"" are sloppy and the blows are very inconsistant, seems to hit heavy and light on the same setting."
3,MADE IN TAIWAN,FUNCTIONS WELL BUT IT'S MADE IN TAIWAN. I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT AMERICAN HAD I REALIZED THAT PORTER-CABLE IS SELLING OUT. don't buy here either support your local guy's - tell them the price you want - they will try to beat it - service still counts for something
5,Relaible and affordable.,"I bought this nailer over a year ago and I am immensely pleased with its performance. I am a home hobbist and have used this gun where I should have been using a more proper tool. The result: everything worked fine. I have put about 3000 nails of every length through it and little oil with no jams an only one or two short feeds. The depth gauge works great and the ""feel"" and weight are right at hand home in my hand. This little marvel has me interested in coming back to PC again and again."
1,Nice while it lasted - which wasn't long,"This was the first nailer I've ever used and I was thrilled with it until it just stopped shooting nails after a couple of small projects. I didn't even get through the tiny starter box of nails that came with the nailer before it died! I took the nailer to a guy who repairs tools and he said that it would cost more to repair than to buy new. He also expressed a very negative opinion about Porter Cable's dramatic decline in quality since they were bought out by DeWalt. From my experience with this product and the advice from a reliable professional, I won't be replacing this nailer with another Porter Cable."
2,Too Many Unanswered Questions,"This book is part of the 43 Light St. series but unlike most of the other books in the series, this one had too many unanswered questions. It was vague and unsatisfying. There was an element of the supernatural to it, which was fine, but the question of what really happened was never answered. I suggest skipping this book, if you aren't insistent on reading every book in the series."
2,Too tenuous and vague,"A bit too much of a mixed bag for my tastes. We are supposed to believe he has supernatural powers, we are supposed to think he is a ghost. Then he is an amnesia victim, but somehow he recalls all sorts of things about his past life. She is supposed to be a Private Eye sent by his sister. The motives of all the villains are not threshed out clearly, and the book just has too many inconsistencies. The characters also lack depth-I mean, this is Harlequin but they should still be something other than their jobs or medical conditions-we never do get to find out why they fall in love so intently in the first place seven years ago, let alone now. And the fact that they already love each other diminishes the tension. Since we don't believe in the villains or the insuperable obstacles, we don't believe in their love and commitment either."
4,an excellent resource for any collector of baseball autograp,Jack Smalling has done an excellent job of providing current addresses for almost every living baseball player (present and past). The book is a terrific resource for anyone who collectors baseball autogrphs via the mail. This is the tenth edition and contains hundreds of additions and updates. A most have for every baseball autograph collector.
3,It's a sad movie,"The soundtrack is incredible and you'll find yourself humming that haunting chord long after the movie. The movie is kinda sad though - the contrast between the life of the main character as a child and the life he lives as an adult is stark. Each time I see the movie, I always wonder why his mother chose to leave the USA and go back to Ireland. The scene when they arrive back in Dublin and to the apartment they used live in after the freedom they experience in the US makes me want to leave my apt and drive somewhere! I typically don't like Irish movies but this one is good"
4,Read the first four pages and you'll be hooked.,"You'll have to read the next page and the next page and so on until you find out where this will end. If you like John Grisham's novels then you'll like this one by Patrick Finneran. Retribution is better than some of Grisham's novels. You're kept in suspense as to how retribution will take place until the very end. Finneran's love for Indianapolis, the Navy, the Catholic Church and most of all his family shows up throughout the novel. A must read for anyone loves suspense!"
1,A poorly researched and even more poorly-written screed,"This book is a joke based on a case that was a joke. Ms. Price wasn not disciplined in any way for being a ""Christian."" She was treated appropriately, and even beyond that, generously, given her egregious misconduct. The Indiana courts properly recognized this ""case"" for what it was, a farce, and summarily and consistently rejected her feeble, laughable claims. Just more nonsense in the ""Christians as victims"" line of ""thinking."""
2,men's choix des sportifs cashmere sweater,"I was very disappointed with the quality - the sweater was very thin, poorly constructed. I would not purchase again."
4,Good sweater,"This was really a great deal, it happened to be on clearance so I paid like $35 for a $125 cashmere sweater.It is fairly thin, but still good quality, really soft. It is definitely on the small side. I'm normally a size medium in shirts but I ordered this in a large and it fits perfect, but I don't dare put it in the dryer because it would definitely be too small (not that you're supposed to dry cashmere anyway)"
3,Not a really good book,"This book lack of good stories. I would prefer a long good story, than a dozen short and averange stories. I recommend than if you expect good stories, do not buy it."
3,A little interesting but not helpful,"Well, I was really expecting more. Nearly everything that is covered in the tape is covered in the description of the product. Other then the convience of not having to read - and be able to listen as driving the information wasn't really new."
5,tuned,i have listed to this over and over and i still love it i have loved the author and this particular titled.
2,Slow & Flippant,"I was hoping to learn more about these children, and what I got was disappointing. While I'm a HUGE fan of Doreen Virtue, this ISN'T one of her best pieces of work. Sorry!!!"
2,"Indigo,Crystal Rainbow Children","Not very well presented...not convincing.There are better books on these children, better researched andwell presented."
4,Character Builders,Have purchased the whole set as a theme builder for Children's Church. The children love them. Recommend for pre-schoolers and early elementary. The only disappointment was the lack of scripture.
3,Historic and Funny,Well the review title sums things up well. Most of the climbs featured in this video are not the sorts of things in Hueco or Bishop that will psych you up to climb on them specifically. They are largely at less visited CA areas. Nor is it the modern beauty and action present in modern films to get you pysched in general.However it is a very funny video with frequent laughs. I also suspect that the older this video gets the funnier it will be. Also it is amazing to see a teenage Chris Sharma tearing things up with his old school lack of technique (or shoes) which he now has gained.
3,not too impressed,"i read some contents of the books, and was really interested. It turns out to be nothing special, but the illustrations are adorable. Overall i was not too impressed. Lilly seems like a Martha Steward hippie version."
3,present for my sister,my sister loves Lilly so i bought this for her for christmas. Very cute coffee table book. Not sure how informative it is but hopefully she likes it.
5,A Lilly must have,I purchased this book as a gift because I believe anyone who loves all things Lilly Pulitzer it is a must have. It's a good read and great coffee table book.
1,An Aryan Dream,"Even as a white woman I find this tough to stomach. If you see people of color in your life and like it that way, this Lily Pulitzer guide is a nightmare. Despite the title of the book, hers is a washed-out and scary vision. Only white people in photos and illustrations. Really really really white people. It's an Aryan Dream to be sure. Lily, come into 21st Century America! I'm returning my copy pronto."
5,Great gift!,"Gorgeous, fun book. Makes me feel like I'm in Florida. The colors are beautiful and it just makes me happy to look at the book. I've given 2 as gifts already to very happy people."
4,Very cute...a little large.,I thought the booties were very cute but the size seemed a bit large. My daughter just turned 12 months and I don't think they will fit her when she is 18 months. Still they were a great deal and I might just try and alter them so they fit. I would recommend going down one size.
2,Kermit Maynard Double Feature,"I ordered this double feature because I remembered enjoying watching old Kermit Maynard movies on TV in the early 50's. I received the DVD before I had a DVD player to play it on. It was sometime later that I opened the case to play the movies.Maynard, Kermit Double Feature: Wildcat Trooper (1936# / Code Of The Mounted #1935)The DVD looked strange, but I started playing it. Imagine my surprise to see on my TV,Partners Of The TrailI never watched any Johnny Mack Brown movies as a child, not any that I can remember. So while I would love to review the Kermit Maynard movies, I can't. I learned the hard way to open and play any DVD's I buy as soon as I get it.PS: When I sent a copy of this review to Amazon, I received word that they will send me the right DVD if I send the wrong one back. I love Amazon. When I see the movies, I will review them."
5,Beanilla says it all...,"These are the freshest vanilla beans you'll find anywhere. I've made vanilla for myself and a few bottles as gifts, try some in your sugar jar for an interesting flavor and last but not least place a bean wrapped in cloth in your linen closet, etc. Beanilla Co.ships fast and you will like the way the beans are wrapped for shipping. #1 in my book...."
5,Very Soft and Fresh!,"I've purchased vanilla beans in stores before and they were awful. Either hard or stiff and difficult to cut. I was thrilled to find these so soft, pliable and fragrant!I ordered these to make homemade vanilla extract. I will DEFINITELY order from here again!"
1,won't be ordering from this company again,I ordered ten vanilla beans from this company. when they came in the mail they were so dried out they would snap in half. there was no way to use them at all. It took several emails and three weeks to finally get a replacement sent. Not happy with halaleveryday at all. Would never order from them again.
3,"Malcolm McDowell is great, but the true story is even better","The story of Patrick is wonderful, but the film would have been better if it was based entirely on Patrick's two letters rather than later legends. Patrick didn't drive the snakes out of Ireland--there were never any there. What Patrick went through and accomplished are amazing. He doesn't need a movie with him turning into a deer or defeating the druids (whom he never even mentions). Watch this movie for some harmless fun, but read Patrick's letters and be really amazed."
2,Saints Preserve Us!!,"This film seems to have striven to use B-grade everything: The actors were hammy, the dialogue sophomoric, and the special effects were seemingly pulled of the dumpsters behind the lot where Cecil B. DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" was made.Still, somehow I enjoyed seeing a version of Patrick's life (how accurate I couldn't say) and somehow ended up finding the film entertaining, though not always in the ways the filmmakers intended. I found myself laughing at things meant to be serious, and cringing at things intended to be moving."
5,A great movie...,"I saw this movie originally when it aired. The movie is well made, especially being a ""made for TV"" movie, the acting is great, historically accruate, it holds the viewers attention and tells the story of St. Patrick's life very well.It is sad that the celebration of this Saint's day is associated with leprechauns and drunkeness... This movie helps shed some light on who this awesome Saint really was."
4,A mythical/historical movie about St. Patrick,"This one of those religious films that can also be classified as fantasy because of the myths that are included in it. Overall, it is a good film but I would have liked it to be a bit more of a drama. Bergen and McDowell are fine in their roles as the title saint and his nemesis in the Catholic Church. The film does reverberate with everything that is Irish, the beautiful landscape, the spirited people, the emotionally-charged and angelic Celtic music and the rich culture that is Ireland."
3,St Patrick,"Some of the film has some poor theatrics depicted in terms of miracles attributed through his ministry, but one does get a strong sense of the seriousness with which he accepted his call and remarkable work in Ireland, and his exuberance for life and for Jesus Christ- a 'stand up' guy against the hypocrisy of the church in his day, and his life blessed thousands and many today."
3,St. Patrick: The Legend,Though it drags a bit I am still glad I bought it. The special effects of the snakes leaving Ireland is cool.
3,It was OK,"It was generally good but I felt that more research could have been done. For example, I'm not sure if they used titles and words like ""your Eminence', 'conclave', 'chess pieces' in this period of history."
5,A lot to offer in this time and culture,"I think this movie was a great beginning and hopefully a forerunner to a definitive movie on this saint, so well ""known about,"" yet so little known. Setting aside the the cheesy presentation of his legendary miracles (some of them do resemble biblical accounts of the miracles of the prophet Elijah), the movie conveyed passion for the spread of the faith and the desparate state of people unenlightened by the message of Christ. In this time and culture, that is a lot to offer."
5,Another beautiful quality,The papo velociraptor is a great dinosaur! It's small and I think that's awesome! I ordered the spinosaurus and the velociraptor together and I love how it seems like Healthstones made it looks like they made them specifically to be accurate in the size differences! I love it! Again if you want to add a great dinosaur to your collection then I would highly recommend purchasing this great item. 5 out of 5 stars!
2,For collectors only,"Baseball Games is a very basic effort: the captions give minimal information, the pictures are just satisfactory, and there's no narrative to put the games in any context. And the price is outlandish !"
3,"Great Picture Book, But Not Comprehensive","The only book of its kind as far as I know, but that doesn't make it OK for it to include many games from after the 1960's and at the same time exclude the most popular games from the 1960's like APBA, Strat-O-Matic, Negamco, BLM, and various similar games. I have seen many other baseball games that were not in this book, too. So while it's a definite must-have for anyone who wants a history of baseball table games, its omissions as well as inclusions of games that were produced well after the book's title would imply (Brett Ball, 1981 ?) make it fall short of expectations. Why not produce 2 volumes and make each comprehensive for its time period ? The implication of the text is that there were far too many pinballs and APBA type games and versions to include them, yet many games far beyond the years listed in the title are pictured. So, it's a great picture book, but far from comprehensive."
5,A Must-have Book for Landscape Painters,"""14 Formulas for Painting Fabulous Landscapes"" is an easy to understand guide to creating beautiful landscape paintings. This book, along with Richard F. Carlson's ""Guide to Landscape Painting"", are the best reference books for any landscape painter, beginner to professional. In fact what Barbara Nuss has done in her excellent book is to take Carlson's concepts and turn them into a practical, step-by-step guide for producing consistently creative landscape paintings.Clear, concise ideas for creating interesting compositions, mixing paints, and various types of painting techniques are provided. Detailed descriptions (with step-by-step photos) for creating a finished work by first doing an on-site pencil sketch, and then producing a field painting, are clearly shown. Using this preparatory research, the reader is then guided on how to make a finished painting."
4,14 formulas for painting Febulous Landscapes,"A lot of great hints for setting up your own landscapes. Many areas in this book that I paid Adult Education classes for. For a used book, I found it gently used and in great shape. Thank you,Barbara Bouchet, Concord, California"
2,Way too simplistic,"Art books should help artists to develop their own language. This book is way too simplistic. If you want your art to look like a dime-a-dozen craft, then the book is okay."
4,Pretty good,"Really liked this one. Just a couple of the songs are skipped, otherwise, great listening. Even the kids like it! Turning Japanese and Mexican Radio are very popular with the 6 year old. Touch Myself only on when no kids around. A really nice mix."
3,A slow start and a WHAM-BAM! ending.,"Two things I can say about this book:1. The story opens to a slow start. This certainly was a deliberate move on Leiber's part. He is working towards a sense of uneasiness, but to me it felt like his characters were moving underwater, slowly and clumsily. Yet, this is all nicely tied up in...2. The brilliant and exhilarating ending. The disjointed happenings of the previous chapters are all nicely wrapped up in this section of the book. Beside it, the rest of the book pales in comparison.I was left with the sensation the book may be too long for the tale it tells. Leiber bursts in creativity and commanding (and maniacal) prose until the last chapter, making the rest of his book seem ungainly.On a final note: Previously, the only other novel by Leiber I had read was ""Conjure Wife"". This one seemed to me a stronger and better effort, and I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing Desk Lamp,"Wow. This is an amazing lamp. It is wonderfully bright and is probably the zaniest lamp I have ever seen. The metallic blue is a beautiful color and looks great. Other reviewers' complaints about lack of brightness are completely unfounded. This lamp provides as much focused light as almost any halogen, fluorescent, LED, or incandescent bulb I have ever seen. It is very flexible, and can be made to just about any shape you could possibly want. Overall, it is a very nice looking, effective, and zany lamp. If you are considering buying a desk lamp, this is the one. Simply outstanding.*By the way-I have not had the lamp for very long so I don't know about how long the 66 bulbs last. Koncept Tech does not sell replacement bulbs, and even if they did, replacing the bulbs would be quite an effort. Koncept claims a 30,000 hr life, and I have no reason to disprove their claim.*"
2,Too many adverts,"Doyle's info was very good and the color arial photos and mini charts are very usefull. The book is 9 inches by 6 inches and has 400 pages, however if you were to remove the advertizments and touristy photos you would probably end up with about 275 pages of usefull info."
5,Recommended to all who run computers in libraries,"The Accidental Systems Librarian is entertaining, informative, and reassuring. As a trainer, I am constantly encountering librarians who were not hired as systems specialists but somehow found themselves in that role. I will be recommending this wonderful book to my students."
1,Buy a different brand,"I bought a set of these TYC headlights for my 2003 Honda Pilot. The first set came on time but each had a broken attachment tab. I returned them for a replacement set and one of headlights of the replacement set also had a broken tab. This was due to the inadaquate packaging from the manufacturer and not from Amazon. I also bought a set of TYC headlights for my mini cooper they were packaged well, however the left and right lights were not identical and therefore could not be aimed to be in balance, had to return those, and I ordered Hella brand. Save yourself time and effort, avoid TYC brand headlights."
3,Product Description not very informative. Too Large!,"I purchased two of these because I do a lot of baking and I prefer Wilton products. I read the description carefully and it seemed pretty standard. When I received my baking cores I realized that they were very large. As I read on the package I saw that these were recommended for baking pans 12"" or larger. I rarely will use a pan that large so this product is not very useful for me. Haven't yet used these so cannot comment on their quality. However, they do seem pretty solid. It seemed more trouble than it's worth to return such small and inexpensive items so they are just taking up room in my kitchen."
5,just as described,this product works just like described but I wish I would have found out before I bought two of them that a flower nail will cook the inside just as well when placed nail up in the center of cake.
5,Best Book on Pro and College Football,"Big Play has the best writing on college football Ive read since Dan Jenkins' classic Saturday's America, and the best stuff on pro football since Tex Maule was at his peak in Sports Illustrated. A great book, particularly the Bart Starr-Johnny Unitas comparison."
5,Worth the money! A game that wouldn't make you bored,"If you want get sweating while playing a racing game, get this one! But don't use a keyboard or mouse to play! It'll just waste the game. Use a wheel such as logitech formula GP in oredr to enjoy the feeling of illegal racing.Only downside is that there are only actificial cars to be chosen in the game. I would prefer to see real cars.But anyway, I rate it 5 stars!"
1,Rockstar Screwup,"Prio to buying I contacted Rockstar through their website and customer service, both told me this game would work for Vista... it wont. The disk wont even become recognized by Vista. I am a computer programmer and very use to getting games to work with Vista, but this one just wont do it.Unless you have XP or a little earlier, dont bother buying the game. It will just become a paper weight.Other than that, I have read other reviews that at this day in age, this game isnt worth your time or money anyways."
1,"Lots of attitude, but no game","Midnight Club 2 has decent graphics if you have the hardware, but it's a complete failure as a racing game. All of your computer opponents fly past you even on straight stretches with the throttle maxed. The damage to your car and others is completely unrealistic, and there's no difference in the way any of these cars drive and handle. I was disappointed with the driving physics in EA's NFS Hot Pursuit, but this game makes it look like a racing simulation in comparison. It's not even good enough to be considered an arcade racer as the keyboard controls are overly sensitive and there's no way to adjust the settings.The PS2 version got a lot of positive reviews, but something was lost in the translation to the PC. If you're looking for a racing game with good graphics and driving physics, NFS Porsche Unleashed is the one to beat. This game doesn't come close."
5,Can't Wait,"I already saw the trailers and all the movie clips and it looks good.I also actually played it on my friend's PS2 and it was so fun.The graphics were better than any other racing games that I know of.If you want a racing game you should get Midnight Club 2,The Italian Job,or maybe Need fo Speed Hot Pursuit 2.I can't wait for Midnight Club 2 to come out for PC."
2,PC version is really lacking...,"The game itself is a lot of fun - it is extremely fast and wild. It is certainly not realistic - you can crash over and over again at high speeds without getting damaged, but it is an arcarde game and not a simulation. The main complaints I have are with the graphics and the controls. I have a very good graphics card (GeForce 5900), but there are no video options for this game! I'm stuck at a low resolution, and it looks terrible by todays standards. Also, there is no way to adjust brightness or contrast, and in a game that takes place primarily in the dark it is often impossible for me to see where I'm going. I don't appreciate having to adjust the displays on my monitor just for this one game. For the controls, I have a force feedback steering wheel, but for some reason I can't configure the use of the gas or brake pedal! Overall, a very disappointing game."
2,A Game To Change The Genre?,"""Not so good"" pretty much sums it up. I have a high performance, new computer and it still does not perform well. The graphics are, at best, sub-par, especially in comparison to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City or even to GTAIII. Either of these would be a much better buy for anyone interested in exciting computer games. It was quite smart and a nice feature to have motorcycles and nitrto boosts and the whole idea of the game is quite good especially after the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies. However, this game simply does not live up to Rockstar's reputation or previous games. Buy your son/daughter/self a diffrent game (e.g. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Soldier of Fortune II, Battlefield 1942, or something else!)-Max"
1,The most lacking game in 2003,"I had high anticipations for this game. The commercials showed a very polished product of great desire, but it looks and plays like a game you used to see in the 1990's. Even with a top of the line gaming setup the graphics are very pixelly: there aren't any options to change your graphic settings. When you're driving around the controls on the car offer no realistic experience. When you tap the key to go right, you pretty much take a 90 turn. Compare that to the new Need For Speed Underground, and Midnight Club II looks like something your grandpa should play."
4,Funky,Not what I was used to from Maceo Parker. Not bad but certainly not Roots and Grooves or School's Out. Good just the same but on a more tame level.
4,"Confortable, utilitarian (an alarm would put it at a 5 stars)","Keeps correct time; shows Day and Date, professional looking.You'll have to bring it to a jeweler to adjust the metal links. It's professional looking and (it says) water resitantant to 300 foot, so you don't have to worry about getting it wet.This watch looks professional without looking gaudy, like many of the ""diver's"" watches I see. I like that I can go to the beach without having to take it off when I go into the water. I have another Citizen from 10+ years ago that still looks good, so I have confidence in the name and quality. You'll probably have to replace the battery every 2-3 years, and make sure to save any extra links in case your wrist gets bigger, but the quality and under $100 price will make this a good dress and professional watch for most."
2,Disappointed,"Being a fan of urban fantasy, and after reading all of the positive reviews on Amazon for this series, I was excited to read the first book in the series. As described, there's a great plot. All of the Celtic myths are returning to Earth, and technology is failing. A band of five are destined to take part in the upcoming battles. Unfortunately, the story is dragged down by flat characters and limp dialogue. Ultimately, the book was disappointing. I will not be reading the second and third book in the series, because although I'm interested to see how the author resolves the plot, I can't stand spending any more time with the characters."
5,Fabulous,"The first book in his trilogy of trilogies, about the return of magic to our modern world. A quest where 5 flawed individuals are brought together to collect various artefacts and try to stop the return of the Nightwalkers. There is alot of Arthurian and Celtic legend within the story and the book gave me pause for thought more than once.How would we cope if technology failed and the monsters and demons of our nightmares and childhood fairy tales really did exist? Chadbourn throws all of this into the melting pot and the result is a hugely enjoyable fast paced urban fantasy that takes you on a whistle stop tour of some of the UK's ancient sites, but also a multi-layered book that gets better and better the more you read it.The flaws of the characters keep them very real, their reactions and actions in the bizarre situations they find themselves in kept me hooked. There is fear, anger, betrayal, love, sex and music all wrapped around a masterful plot of myth, legend and magic."
2,OK Premise - Reads like it is written by a 16 year old,"This book is readable, but the writing is hackneyed and a bunch of the narrative elements are annoying. It has been years since I have read a book this poorly written, full of repetitive declaratory statements detailing the interior thoughts of the characters.""Church felt bad because his girlfriend was dead."" Seriously if you have to read slight variations on that sentence 20 times in the same book, it will drive you nuts.Also the same metaphors and similes are used over and over again. Finally all the elements dealing with any sexual tension or encounter seem gratuitous and extremely awkward. This book is poorly written and poorly edited.That being said, if you are looking for a brain dead beach read, or if you could care less about writing proficiency maybe you won't find this book as annoying as I did."
3,Frustrating,"I found ""World's End"" a frustrating read. The book has a strong premise and Chadbourn is capable of real moments of brilliance, yet, overall, the work is flat and clumsy in its execution. I found it difficult to get past the weak, stilted writing; the paint-by-numbers plotting; and the monodimensional characters who are more stereotype than archetype. It just lacks the richness and power that its premise promised, and that it delivers at a few points in the text. Although it's technically written for children, Susan Cooper's ""Dark is Rising"" series handles similar material with much greater adeptness, and I'd recommend it above this failed attempt."
5,Not another DIET book,this is a great tips and treats book...not on how to deprive yourself but a realistic and interesting approach to a healthy lifestyle...Great read!
5,"Fun to Read, Packed with Info You Can Really Use","This is a book for real women with real lives who want to be healthy and have fun. It has tips that make sense, not the usual ""if you really crave french fries, have a carrot stick instead."" It's so much fun to read, you feel like you've been hanging out with girlfriends. The recipes are delicious and the tips and tricks from the famous women quoted are wonderful. The format makes it great for the attention span challenged like me - you can pick it up, flip to a page you like and get great info on the fly. Lots of books tell you how to eat healthy, but thanks Carolyn and Densie for also telling us how to be fabulous!!"
2,Yuck,"I didn't enjoy this book. It was written in a very simple manner and I never quite understood what the author's were trying to say. Is it a cookbook? A guide to choosing ""smart"" food? Still not sure."
5,Make the Dish your next book club selection!,"In a time when there are so many books, articles and even television shows on eating ""right,"" this one hits it right on the mark. Often, I look through these books and read a chapter or two and then put it back on my bookshelf, never to return. I read this one cover-to-cover, and even marked pages with the little post-it-note things! It doesn't weigh you down, but instead you want to finish it AND follow it! Thanks for writing a book that is hip and funny (and funny) as well as useful.It's a fun read, great info, and a wonderful reference. FABULOUS girlfriend/sister/mother gift! And seriously, wouldn't this be a fun change for a book club?"
2,too expensive,"just use a plastic scraper or razor scraper with one hand, and the steamers other attachments (like triangle brush) w/ other.also, i saw this for $2.95 at another site. that sounds more reasonable to me, if i was going to replace mine...which came with the ladybug."
4,Absolutely great..,I found Conan to be a good read. The main character is great an all the story has a fast and clear reading. Racommended for Conan fans and for all fantasy's fan ..
2,"Weak reception, shop around","While I did not have much problems configuring it to use with the wireless network I have access to, I've watched with envy as some of my colleagues enjoyed wireless access in a much wider area than I did.Keep in mind, that ""open field"" distance on this model is only around 300feet, or about 1/3 of other products available on the market. If your wirelss network is strong, it's probably a less of a concern. But if you want to have a longer ""electronic leash"", go ahead and buy something else."
2,It freeze my laptop frequently,"Although it works, it will freeze my laptop without any reason. Seems it's safe when the signal isn't too strong(yellow icon). By the way, no news for my rebate application after nearly half an year."
2,High failure rate,"I purchased 7 USR wireless products almost a year ago, USR2410 (PC Card) and USR2415 (PC Card with PCI adapter). Within the first 4 months, 2 failed and in the past 2 months, 2 more failed. The failure seems to occur in the PC card itself (USR2410). I had a problem returning the first card, but each subsequent return has been uneventful. While USR seems to provide support, this doesn't fare well for cost of ownership and reflects poorly on the quality of these products. I've since switched to D-Link and have been much happier!"
4,It works very fine!,I have this card work with DLink Di-614+ and Linksys BEFW11S4. I am pretty happy with it. This card should be the OEM version of Prism2. Linux users can try generic Prism2. The reception rage is quite fair.The price after rebate is almost equal to a wired network card. It is really a goo deal.
5,It is all worth the money,In fact i am writing this review after hooked up this wireless card to my laptop. Please remember to download the latest drivers from site. USR.com
5,"bright, no complaints","These were nice, crisp, bright white light replacement bulbs, and they didn't burn out early or anything. Enjoyed them, no complaints."
5,Outstanding Product!,"I drive 100 miles a day in a car that has Daytime Running Lights (DRL's) where the bulbs are also on during the day, but with less intensity. These bulbs consistently last me 2 years of driving - that is 40,000 miles! I have been using these bulbs since 2006 and just bought my fourth set for this car. I am also very pleased with the brightness and distance that the light projects. I highly recommend this set."
2,Disappointed lifetime,"Replaced these in my wife's 2007 CRV where the OEM bulbs had lasted 3 years.These bulbs were brighter than the original though not greatly so. However, one year later, the driver's side bulb died (and yes, I handled them with clean disposable gloves when replacing them).So I was happy with the light, but clearly not happy with only 1/3 of the lifetime."
1,Both burned out within 18 months,"I bought these bulbs in November of 2009 figuring that the bulbs in my car were almost 10 years old, were dimming, and we had a long road trip coming up in spring 2010. A little preventative maintenance, right?The new bulbs were a serious improvement over the old ones, but I expected almost any new bulb to be.The drawback to spending 24 bucks on 2 bulbs is that the right side burned out in 15 months and the left side burned out in 17 months.Guess what bulbs are back in the vehicle? The original ones!That's a pretty disappointing scenario for my money. I'll try another brand when (or IF) the OEM bulbs ever fail."
4,GE Nighthawks...a great headlight replacement,"I put these in my 1999 Toyota 4Runner and they definitely made a difference. I can definitely see further ahead and there is way more light on the side of the road making it easier to see deers and things like that. It's one of those things you buy and say ""I'm glad I bought it"""
3,"A good yarn, but . . . . .","A good yarn by White, but CS Forester, Dewey Lambdin and Julian Stockwin... he's not."
5,More action from Kent.,"I had not heard of Alexander Kent until I complained at a book store that they had no copies of Patrick O'Brian's books. The owner said, ""Have you read any of Alexander Kent?"" I had not, and that began a wonderful new adventure. Kent writes naval stories about the same historical time period as O'Brian, but Kent often has more action scenes, which I thoroughly enjoy. If you like O'Brian, you will love Kent.Prentice Kinser III, D.Min., Author of:Limitless Living, A Guide to Unconventional Spiritual Exploration and Growth"
4,The Greater the Honor -- Brief Review,"""The Greater the Honor"" is not the ususal sailing ship book. Indeed the first 40% revolves around a U.S. naval court marshal. This is by far the best part of the book.Set in the period leading up to the war of 1812, we get another look at Decatur and his fictional officers. Decaur is a running sterio-type. Some of the fictional characters are utilized to bring out the sectionalism that afficted the United States before and during the war of 1812.Otherwise this is yet another sailing ship romp perhaps not as good as O'Brien or Forester but certainly cast in the same mold.mjc"
5,EVERYONE NEEDS LOVE,This song is cerrying very special words in it.its cerrying love that sometimes lovers whisper through their ears.and the words saund with a perfect voice in your heart.
4,Buddy Guy is a master of the blues!,"All the great icons in the blues world are getting older, but still have the energy and the strength necessary to gather people around this genuine American music style. I had the privilege to get an autograph and shake his hand in 1996, when I visited this venue in Chicago for a Long John Hunter's concert. Buddy Guy has come to Brazil for many times, but the price for the tickets is always incredibly high. So, this title (as are many of his participations in other artists' DVD's) is sort of a consolation for me. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to the fact that many of his commentaries (although interesting), interrupt the performances. Maybe they should be placed between the songs, rather than in the middle of them. For blues music fans, I highly recommend this ""Real Deal""."
2,"what a rip, 8 songs, most slow","Damn Right I've Got The Blues is about the only thing worth a squat on this whole dvd. the rest are slow, boring, and ONLY 8 SONGS! this was filmed about the same time I saw Buddy, 1996, and he looks just like the way I rem the show. The show was in a hotel, bottom floor, fancy lobby of a high dollar $$$$ Hilton, it was so loud, to all our delite, and so many fast songs, and almost 2 hours worth, everyone left 3 feet off the ground, prob one of the best shows ever seen. only thing was, it was so loud, they had so many complaints from the people in the above floors, this was the LAST concert here haha. my ears rang for hours. I was in the 6th row i think it was. he has this all white band, another guitar player who was killer in is own right, looked like a surfer dude. about a 1000 people. never forget it. but I will this dvd, as soon as I sell it."
1,Don't buy,"I bought these for my wife and I ordered the Peltor brand for myself in a larger size. These are a cup with a piece of sponge in them, she was vacumming when I received them and she said they were garbage, and besides don't pay the extras delivery charge for speedy delivery, the seller just sits on the order anyway, they arrived just as if I had used ground shipping. I think they keep the extra couple of bucks for any price cut they might of giving you upfront!"
4,for smaller heads?,"these are excellent for cutting sound out, but are a little on the small side, maybe more for women or kids. A man with a large head these won't work IMHO."
4,Best protection for our baby!,"We bought these headphones for our 8 month old because we attend a lot of concerts and my husband flies little planes that have loud noises. These are great because they do protect from the sound. For babies they are a little heavy. My son is pretty strong and can hold is head up for a few minutes but then gets a little tired. He'll be able to use them longer as he gets older.We like our purchase. The only down side is when we try to put them on while he is in his car seat, it can be a little challenging to get them right on the ears, while pulling the headphones wide enough to go completely over the head. This is a very minor issue but it take a couple tries to get it right. The car seat was only so wide so you can see the issue.Other than that, great purchase and highly recommend.Misty"
4,"Good protection, a little small",The AO Slim muffs worked well for a trip to the gun range. I used them over foam ear plugs and all the loud cracks became dull thumps.They're comfortable and well made but a little on the small side. The size adjusts and they should be good for most but be careful if you have a big dome.
1,"If you think upgrading, forget it!","I am running both German and English versions 4.0 and thought upgrading to 6.0 with Windows XP would be a good idea. Forget it! The program froze! I uninstalled and then reinstalled. Now, it would't accept the product key printed on the box. There is no support. I send the product back, losing [the cost of] S&H.;If you buy, you are in for a rough ride!"
5,distinto,"Es un buen libro, pero no el mejor que he leido de Stephen King.En este libro Stephen King cambia un poco el estilo de libros anteriores, pero aun así es un libro muy recomendable para los seguidores de él."
5,Excellent Book,"Anger in the work place is an excellent resource for men and women in the work place. Anger is an issue that effects all of us in mostly negative ways. Althought anger can certainly be a positive catalyst for change, generally speaking anger creates unnecessary stress which can manifest itself in unhealthy ways. Overeating, drinking to excess etc, are examples of how unresolved anger can manesfest itself in unhealthy ways. This book helps people manage their anger in positive ways. The author recommends simple steps which are very helpful on a daily basis. The book is written simply and is to the point. I recommend this book for anyone who struggles with internal and unconscious anger. A thumbs up to Ms. Leslie!"
3,bed frame,"i love the headboard, but the picture on the advertisement was miss-leading...we were expecting headboard, side rails and footboard. after recieving he headboard and realizing the mix-up we had to then order a matress support frame, and a universal connection so we could connect the two. figuring this our was a bad experience!"
1,Beyond Horrible,"Okay, I knew this DVD would be bad, but my daughter had hurt herself and needed to spend a quite day, so I let her pick a DVD and she chose this one. It is not just bad, it is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Two junky cartoons and two semi-animated storeis. All are CRAP. Disney really should be ashamed of themseleves."
2,Disney Leftovers,"I bought the sing-a-long for Christmas and my little girl loves it. In March we gave her the Stories for her 4th birthday. She has watched it exactly one time. The first story is about Ariel meeting a hearing impaired mermaid who signs. The next two stories were read aloud over still pictures that changed occasionally. The last story was an old episode from the Aladdin series on the Disney channel. I suspect the Ariel story was an old episdode, too. They weren't even good stories! I would have preferred all the stories to be the still kind if they were at least original. I am very disappointed in Disney. Walt must be turning in his grave!"
1,I'm blown away at how poor this DVD is,I have never been so unhappy with a product I've bought my entire life. I'm looking to see if I can get this returned though it is opened. Two of the stories aren't even animated. It's voices over pictures. My three year old kept asking for Cinderella after she watched it and all we could tell her was that was it. I've never seen her so disappointed. I feel like I've been ripped off.
1,embarrising,Somebody at Disney actually put their stamp of approval on this one? My two girls lost interest after 5 minutes with this one. I wouldn't buy it at a rummage sale for .25 cents. Awful story telling awful artwork and awful editing.
1,Horrible on so many levels,It's the worst movie that I've seen in a very long time. It's not worth the money that you have to spend.
2,Awful,"I bought this as my daughter is a princess fan. My daughter unfortunately loves it, which means I am stuck watching it many times. The quality is terrible and two of the stories are still, storybook turning pages. I would waste $2.50 as someone else mentioned, but no more. I rated it a two stars only because my daughter loves it."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I was excited when I got this movie for my daughter, but as soon as I started the DVD I was extremely disappointed. Ariel and Jasmine's ""short stories"" are literally one of the shows taken from their corresponding mini series (""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"") that aired on the Disney channel a while back. Poor quality and confusing story lines. The other two are just images taken from the movies and are told in a ""story book"" format. No animation, just the princess' voice. And they last maybe a total of 10 minutes. Like I said, complete waste of money."
1,Can't believe I spent money on this,"I am a huge fan of disney, but this movie is terrible! I wish we would have read the reviews before we bought it. It's nothing like what I expected...just 4 short stories, and two of them aren't really even a ""cartoon"", they are like a read-along story where the picture changes every 10 seconds. Very poor."
1,"Disney , home of the world's biggest RIPOFFS!","Disney advertised this movie BAD. my sister wanted it so much.i bet she was dissapointed, becauseshe only watched it once. disney really doesn't care aboutwhat entertains kids- they just want MONEY! they want you to buythe whole series and you win a cardboard castle.DO NOT BUY THIS!"
2,Disappointing,This movie is not worth buying. It has four stories and only two are actually animated. The others are a still shot with narration. Those two that are animated are done badly. The words don't even match up with the animation and the story lines are lame. I was surprised to see such a result from Disney but then I rarely buy their straight to video DVD's.Don't waste your money.
1,Horrible - want my money back!,"I purchased Volume One from Babies R Us for $14.99. I thought it would be a very sweet DVD with new stories for my 2 year old to watch as she loves the princesses. BUT, I found 2 very long stories (one of Jasmine and one of Ariel) apx 30 min each (the other two stories were apx 10 min each and very poor animation), both were very frightening for a 2 yr old. The DVD did not have a rating on it (like G, PG, etc) and there was no description on the back explaining the stories had monsters and scary scenes in it. I feel it would have been better if the DVD had listed a short decription of each story on the back and a suggested age should have been printed as well. I would say this DVD is good for 9 and up. But definitely not a toddler. I just wish I had enough information ahead of time and I would not have purchased this DVD. Especially since I can't return it now that it's open."
2,Of inferior quality and a letdown,"Most of the reviewers dislike this product and I concur - the quality of this DVD in terms of its features is deplorable. There are only two 'real' animated features starring Ariel and Princess Jasmine, and like another reviewer mentioned, these weren't exactly original episodes either as they have been shown on TV before. The other two stories featuring Belle and Cinderella are more of a cut-and-paste feature. Except for the music video which my preschooler found captivating, the other bonus features were ho-hum, and I found the 'How to Be a Princess"" quiz to be rather annoying. Final verdict - lackluster and disappointing production by Disney."
3,Should have been better - just rehashes of old stuff !,I agree that this DVD was very disappointing. I put it on for my daughter and realized that the Ariel story was the same thing that I had seen about a month ago on the Toon Disney cable channel (this is the best part of the whole movie). There are also Cinderella and Belle stories that are just narrated (as if they were from a book) and I think the stories were taken from the straight to video movies that came out before. The Jasmine story looked as if it were taken from an Aladdin cartoon on Toon Disney and the story featured more of Aladdin than Jasmine. Please Disney - how hard is it to create some lovely new stories that feature the Princesses? I am giving it 3 stars for the concept and the fact that my 3 year old daughter will watch it because she loves the Princesses but it is really a rip-off to package old stuff as new.
5,It's a nice addition to the princess collection,I really don't understand what all these negative reviewers are talking about. The stories are cute and my daughter really loves the animated story book (similar to Vtech readers or the iXL reader). It's entertaining and a nice addition to her princess collection.The one thing I will agree with is that the quality of the movie isn't all the wonderful but it might be because I'm spoiled with my HD TV. My 3 year old doesn't seem to mind at all and it doesn't affect the cartoon at all. It's a kids cartoon and if your kid is 3-5 years old and a hard core princess fan then she'll probably love it.
2,"I hate it, but my daughter loves it.","Unfortunately, the DVD was a gift from a doting grandma, SO we couldn't return the darn thing. But my daughter likes it and wants to watch it all the time. She's too young to understand the poor quality and cheesiness of it all. Shame on Disney for putting the adults in this house in total misery. We all love the original stories, but these are painful! We may have to accidentally lose/break/scratch our DVD."
2,A True Disapointment,"As a huge fan of this author, I was very disapointed in this book. I have read everything by her and this one left me wondering ""what happened?""Lucas O'Reilly has ordered a mailorder bride from an agency in New York, requesting a woman who can cook, clean, etc. What he gets is Jennifer Alston, who can't do either and to me, was ungrateful, rude and unlikeable.She came to Thunder Canyon for marriage but acted like she was put out by the whole idea. The fact that the marriage remained unconsumated for a very long time, that her husband would be that tolerent with this annoying female was unrealistic. The whole book was just boring, unbelieveable and lacked any spark...skip this one."
2,Not that good,Overall its a good cd but some songs just drag on. chuy and mauricio is the best song on there. dont pay alot for this cd.
4,Original Funk,"Funky Funky Funky !With a subtile hint of Jazz.Good tracks are Whats up front, thinking single and rhythm changes."
4,Starts Strong,"This was a big leap forward musically for the Counts compared to their first album, Jan Jan (they called themselves the Fabulous Counts then). However, this album isn't nearly as consistent as the first one. The title track is an instant classic and the overlapped vocal rhythms are fantastic. However, as with so many funk bands, the lyrics, vocals and ballads slow these guys down. Thinking Single and Rhythm Changes are real good, but (and I am a fan) you might be better served picking up the Westbound compilation Gettin' It Off (which is amazing!)"
2,Ehhh,"I consider myself a funk enthusiast. These guys lay down a killer groove, but the songs go nowhere. The only song that makes it work, and happens to be a killer, is the title track. ""Motor City"" grooves too. I liked their stuff better when they were the ""Fabulous Counts"". One more thing.. funk is not a lyrical medium.. I know that.. but some of these lyrics were just stupid. Other bands have done this type of thing much better, and i'm at odds with all the fuss."
5,My Girls LOVE it!!!!,Perfect for little girls. My 2 and 4 year old LOVE this video and want to sing along to all the songs.
3,"Not bad for an old DVD, subtitles annoying","Our 2-year old daughter loves music and likes the visuals, but I am not fond of the lyrics at the bottom of the screen that are a part of the movie/songs. It would have been nice to be able to remove the lyrics by hitting the subtitles button on your player/remote. As an older DVD, it's also in in 1.33 : 1 aspect ratio which is a bit annoying for those with widescreen TVs (probably most of the country by now).As mentioned by others, the narrator is unnecessary (and annoying after a while). I think most kids want to get to the song. In this world of immediacy, it may teach us patience... but it's a bit of a nuisance to have to bear before and after each song. I'm there if Disney ever makes one of these for blu-ray players as long as you can remove the subtitles/lyrics and just watch the songs."
3,It was ok,It was ok. I thought there would be the princesses in it together.... My daughter didn't care to much for it and she is a big Disney Princess fan.
4,Big hit!,"This DVD is a big hit with my 4 year old. She watches it over and over and walks around the house singing the songs. Unlike some of the movies, there are no parts that scare the younger kids, so you don't need to be careful about who else is watching."
5,My daughter's favorite,I bought this for my daughter when she turned 2. She is almost 3 now. She has really enjoyed it. I think the 30 minutes is a good length...not too long and it holds her interest with a variety of princesses and their songs.
5,Overview of DVD,"Length:: 5:33 MinsFairwinds Publishing has produced this video to give you a brief overview of what this Book on DVD contains, this way you can make an informed decision regarding the purchase of this DVD.

4,More Science!,"My son is 4 years old and we read to him a lot. Now, before bed, he announces, ""Mom, you know what kind of book to read....ONLY SCIENCE!"" He loves science, and the Magic School Bus is a great, fun way to introduce it, even to a preschooler!"
4,Beekeeper's Review,"Kids (of all ages) ask the darndest things. When we work fairs or are identified as beekeepers in public, we are bomberded with basic questions regarding honeybees. This book was bought for my mother as much as for my brother's son. He asks her questions difficult to answer without pictures, ""How do bees make wax...?"" This book goes into enough detail to answer all the ""How do...?'s"" likely to come up regarding honeybees. A fine book for any child interested in insects. Also a good selection to temper the fears of those children that may fear bees. The pages are a little busy, otherwise would have gotten 5 stars."
5,brains and science are rightfully valued - how un-American!,"This is a great, almost un American book in that kids are told that it's OK, even wonderful and wondrous to be science geeks, be curious. Love the Frizz when she says ""take chances, get messy, make mistakes,"" and encourages her students to explore. In a society that elevates sports and violence for boys, and beauty and cattiness for girls, this series stands out for encouraging gender neutral intellectualism and academic achievement. My geeky 5 year old can't get enough, having finally found fictional characters that reflect her and encourage her. Factual substance-wise, I as a 40 year old have learned tons."
2,Poorly informed,I bought this product for a Jeep Wrangler and I was informed by the seller that it would work on one. It does not....not even close. It does work on some small cars but you have to be careful since the product can bend the insulation around the door and create possible leaks.
1,Tedious and empty,"I found it interesting that one of the editorial reviews for this book contained the following: ""Her mother lives in a world bounded by self-delusion, empty rituals, and meaningless cliches."" This book is filled with empty rituals and meaningless cliches and was terribly disappointing. I had heard good things about the author, but I fail to see where any of those good things come into play here. This is pretty tedious stuff."
3,Inventing the Wahls...,"When I first read the back cover of ""Rowing In Eden"", I thought that it sounded a lot like the film ""Inventing the Abbotts."" There were many similarities as it turned out, but lots of differences, too.The book is centered around the Wahl family, especially the three daughters-Rosamund, Martie, and Franny. The novel is told through Franny's eyes, the youngest sister at 13. During the summer of 1965, Franny comes of age at the lakeside resort where she lives.Her parents seem far too preoccupied with her older sisters to take much notice of her, so Franny spends most of her time writing in her journal, reading poetry, and spending time with her friends. While Rosamund and Martie are entertaining their college friends at a party one night, Franny finds her independance and her first love. From that moment on, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery that her older sisters have yet to learn for themselves.A beautifully-written and very descriptive novel!"
5,"Tasty jerky, handy sized packages","I am a big fan of beef jerky, and this is one of the best. Also, the package size is handy for a quick snack."
3,Simple Succinct and Clarifying,"I stumbled on Mr. Shore's wonderful book whilst browsing for other photography books. This book while not breaking any new ground in Photography theory gives permission for the reader to reclaim and rexamine what a traditonal analog photograph can be. Admittedly it does not cover contemporary digital issues, it makes no claims to be this anyway, being more democratic in it's intention.This book has allowed me to clarify in a succinct and simple manner a variety of issues that I have known intuitively since becoming serious about my image making, and now feel better equipped to share with my students.This kind of writing is refreshing and uplifiting, something I feel is desirable in this hectic post modern world."
5,Clear and Smart,This book helped me understand photographs in a way I never did before. The writing is deceptively condensed. It is really full of ideas and meaning. Being aware of these ideas has hepled my own photography.
3,Interesting but lacking,"The narrative is sparce, but attempts to describe different ideas of framing such as ""active framing"". However, the photographs that are selected as examples do not seem to be well matched, and numerous photos are presented as representative without ever explaining why. I long for a photography photo book that is both analytical and visually pleasing. This is not it."
3,Gets old quickly.,This is one of the games that gets used by your kids for a week or two and then never gets played any more. If you can get it for a few dollars then that week or two may be worth it.
4,Very Nice age appropriate game.,"With children playing all these games with are way to old for them, this is a wonderful game to have in my house that my 11 year old really likes and even my 15 year old even played it too."
1,Game is too hard for pre-schoolers!,"I don't know who they made this game for but it wasn't the 4 -5 year old. I thought since this game was about Shrek it would be suitable for little folks. It isn't. There is something about the camera angles on this game that may even the simplest task difficult. The game mechanics stink!My little guy ended up trying to do a simple task (climbing boxes) and fell down so many times I had to do it for him. Did I succeed? No!The perspective of this game is odd and you can't really tell how high you are jumping or even figure out where you will land. End result, mounds of frustration.It's almost as if the developers had a weird sense of humor and made the game control as difficult as they could.I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game for players under the age of 7 and I don't even know if they would be able to play it.Horrible game!"
3,Good without a helmet,These work well for me as long as I don't wear a helmet. A helmet ends up blocking the fan and pushing down on the goggles which then pushes my glasses out of position. It's a good idea but they need to make a helmet that works with them.
1,Does not work,"If you use glasses with the goggles the glasses will fog. The goggle has a two-speed fan. Using in Hi does not improve the problem.The Smith Knowledge goggles have a top of foam around the small fan. I believe is to allow the forced air to escape with the moisture from inside the goggle. When the foam get wet it clogs and the moisture keeps inside fogging the glasses.I bought a no fog cloth from Smith also, trying to minimize the problem, wiped dry the glasses as per the instructions. It didn't made any difference, the glasses got foggy anyway.The Goggle in the actual picture does not match the product, the picture shows the OTG ( over the glass ) with no fan model.Not worth the more than $ 100.00 it cost."
1,Creationist Diet:: Nutrition and God-Given Foods According t,"First let me say I was very sceptical of a book authored by someone that has to put down others to make himself look good. If I had wanted a Bible study course, this might have been great, but it falls short on the type of advice I had hoped to find which was a solid, sensible diet for good health. My husband has cancer and we need proof that a system works. We will stay with the wonderful diet we found in ""Gods Way to Ultimate Health"" by George Malkmus. We attended their retreat and they DO know what they are doing!!!! One other great read is Consious Eating by Gabriel Cousens. Both are miles better than this book."
2,"Who's ""In""? Who cares.","John Fairchild is the charismatic and outspoken publisher of two of the fashion industry's most influential magazines: Women's Wear Daily and W. Here he offers the ultimate insider's guide to today's fashion scene--a gossipy, no-holds-barred look at the world of the superstar designers and social climbers who buy their clothes. It's actually a pretty boring book. It was written in the 80's so it's really dated. I wouldn't recommend this one, it's way too pretentious."
1,"Actually mentions: ""Fashion intellectuals""","It doesn't seem possible, but this guy wrote 2 books about the fashion world with the word 'SAVAGES' in the title. Kinda like Frank Herbert's 'Dune' series, or 'Son of Kong'."
3,hard to understand instructions,the instructions are hard to understand how to set it up and use it. have tried but no head way so it is sitting in the box and am looking for one that I can use.
2,i used it once,"It looks neat ,but it is just as fast to just use a file buy itself .amazon has a great price .the local chain saw dealer sells the same thing for over a hundred bucks.so get it at amazon."
5,Great time-saver!,"This thing works very well, only after experimenting with settings. The directions are certainly not the best, but with a little bit of mechanical sense, the lack of good directions can be overcome. If you aren't mechanical, find a neighbor or friend who is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Granberg Saw Sharpener,A pain in the b**t to use;A bunch of parts that won't stay connected. There's got to be a better way.
4,Easy to use and great results,It is easy to install and use. The results are as good as any chain saw shop I have used. The price was lower than what I could find local
4,Works as advertised,"I left out one star for the minimalism of manual with the product. It took me quite some time to figure out that the two keys are completely independent and I should set them up separately. I guess the idea here is that you could use it to open two garage doors. For me, I only have one garage door so I let both of them control the same door."
5,Finally we got one,"After months of searching and calling numerous stores in three states and bidding daily on ebay. Amazon finally had them in stock! I LOVE AMAZON!!! And I got free shipping! I'm so glad I didn't win the bids I made for over $50 for it though. It is great and my son is so happy he finally has all the cars and playsets. It's the best of the four. I hope they bring out some more playsets like the cozy cone, sarge's, maters, filmore's, etc."
5,Flo's V8 Cafe Playset a hit,My son loves this playset. He got all four Car's playsets for Christmas. They are all very cute and he loves playing with them. He especially likes that they each light up. He turns all the lights out in the house and lights up Radiator Springs.
2,Colonial and revolutionary history of upper South Carolina,"The description of the book ""Colonial and revolutionary history of upper South Carolina"" states that ""This is an OCR edition with typos. "" What an understatement and misleading statement. It does not warn potential buyers of gaps in the book's copy. It is riddled with typos and missing signficant data that was contained in the original book first published in 1897 and reprinted again in 1962 by The Reprint Company. I was expecting to receive a full copy at $25.95. Instead I got two copies at $52. The value of the book as a research tool is much diminished. Had the description of the book been honest and said there were gaps in the copy, then I would have been forwarned. Since it is coming through Amazon from a seller other than Amazon, there is a no-return policy."
1,picture very deceiving,"You only get one box of the set, not all six boxes. The description of the product is very unclear. Also questions are very unchallenging. I am a homeschooling mother and I would not recommend this product."
1,Unhappy,In the past all the slim Jims I've ordered have been fresh....This time they were stale and hard as a rock...with little taste.No sell by date on them and I think they are way past date..
3,greasy,This tasted ok but it was very greasey and the skin was tough. I went with Jack Links peppered beef steaks. I could get this item at my store but i was able to get it in bulk at amazon.
4,yum but...,"This is a tasty snack and all but, if you're an unhealthy person, you might want to reconsider and get some sugar-free ice cream instead. Loads of sodium that you probably wouldn't want in your system. Meaning if you were stranded on a deserted island with a pack of this, and there was no water. A few slim jims will kill you off, that's assuming you want to survive."
2,Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks,"I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper. They are also a bit more ""dried out"" in consistency. I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew."
2,Not that great,These are greasy and not very good. I suppose some people may like it but I left them in our work break room so others would take them down. They are beef and not a pork mixture so that's good for people who don't eat pork.
2,not very fresh,I bought two boxes and they were sooooooo hard. Will not buy again. They didn't tell me they were about to expire..Ask first!
3,Not Fresh,Not very fresh....Experation date less than 2 months?The experation is on each individual SlimJim so you can't check that until you open the box.Each individual seemed different from the other. Some were tough and hard to chew and some were ok.I'll probably buy at the store from now on.
1,Disappointing for a Slim Jim lover,"White trash, indeed. The Slim Jims of the same size in the canisters were great - salty, dry, chewy - the way I like my pepperoni stick snacks. These were moister and almost gross. I'm hoping I can get rid of them when friends come to visit, drink beer, and watch football, but I'm not eating any of these. Probably just as well. I won't reorder this box."
2,Bursting with goo....,"I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet. I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone. Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth. Not a sensation I enjoy. Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra ""oomph"" packed in.Ill give it an extra star due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese."
1,mushy and gross,"Our family loves Slim Jims and we eat a lot of them.This was the second time I ordered from Amazaon, the last time they tatsted normal. This time, my sons will not eat another one. They said it was very gooey and gross. The date code said exp. Jan 2013. I bought them in July 2012. No one got sick, but the consistency was definitely not right. Maybe a bad batch?"
3,Okay,A good snack but became sick of it. The sticks are about 3 inches in length. A pack of 100 seems like a lot for a fair price.
1,Not even good for rat bait.,Bought some of these awhile back when they were on sale for 10c each at my local Safeway grocery. I personally found them to be disgusting. Tried using them in rat traps but the rats won't even touch them!
2,Some of the worst stuff on EARTH!,"Only things worse are as follows:LiverOkraAsparagusBrussel Sprouts (SP?)Lemon Marangue pie (SP?)Anything lemon, besides the sodasHorse radish sauceOlives, any colorBeefaroniRavioliSpaghetti in a canAnd other disgusting foods (BLEH!)2 stars."
3,slim Jims,"My grandson ate just about all of them, I should have hid them.They go great with beer. It's a good thing grandson is to youngto drink."
5,TASTE GREAT,"My husband love monster slim jims. Alot cheaper to buy it by packs then pieces. He ate 2 packs in a month, he is something but anyways I do recommend this to everyone. Great price for great products."
3,Allright snack stuff.,"Well, it's as advertised, tabasco flavored double sized slim jim.It's just not as great as some of the other flavors like sweet/hot, nacho, and so on. It's not even really that hot. They captured 80% of the flavor of tabasco, and none of the heat."
4,"Soft Inside, firm on the outside",Tasty snack you can enjoy on the go. This Slim Jim Stick has a firm casing texture on the outside and a soft meat filling inside. I'm a big Tabasco fan and the Tabasco gives this Slim Jim a nice finish in the favor department. It goes well with cheeses.Warning to Girly-Men: The after taste of this Tabasco Slim Jim can and will over ride your minty fresh breath...
1,The modern Slim Jim is a far cry from the original,"Back about 30 years ago, Slim Jim made some DAMN fine beef sticks. They were probably the best that I can recall ever having since.Todays greasy orange Slim Jim is TOTAL GARBAGE, in comparison to what it used to be a few decades ago. I don't know when their recipe changed, but I think it was around 25 years ago.Those of you that think Slim Jims are good now would be shocked and disgusted if you were able to try the old recipe Slim Jim beef sticks. (which sadly are no longer made)"
3,It was better this time.,IT WAS BETTER THIS TIME THE LAST TIME I ORDERED THIS I WAS MISSING 3 SLIM JIM OUT OF THE BOX. I SAW THE BOX OPEN WHEN I RECIEVED IT. SO I SAT THERE AND COUNTED AND I WAS MISSING 3 SLIM JIM. I TRIED TO RIGHT A REVIEW BUT THERE WASN'T AN OPTION FOR ME TO DO SO. I WS DISAPPOITNED LAST TIME. THIS TIME THE BOX CAME CLOSED AND WHEN I COUNTED I COUNTED EXACTLY 100.
1,How the heck do you chew Slim Jims?,"Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat. The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky."
1,Taste,"It contains too much fat and when you bite it than you can feel the fat in your mouth, it's disgusting."
4,Can anyone else confirm this?,"I got a new batch of these tasty sticks and it seems they withered down the skin quite a bit. Even just early this yr, I had to many times spit out the skin because I just couldn't chew it enough to let it go down. I was basically chewing on it enough to get the inner ""meat"" out of the tough casing. Now, I can barely notice the casing and *everything* goes down much easier. I just had 2 sticks and they were yummy!!"
3,Has the formula changed?,Not a bad snack. The kids love them. Great for camping and school...but has the formula changed? THey are pretty greasy! Fatty. salty? Hm...
1,Bad quality control,"The box came open with two sticks missing. It's not worth the effort to return and refund, but when you order a pack of 100 you want a pack of 100."
5,Good stuff for the price,"It's a good snack for when I don't have time to run out and get something to eat. I know it's bad for you, but it tastes so good."
4,Good Meat Snack - Recommended,"This review is for the Slim Jim .28oz (Pack of 100) Meat Snacks. Being a Type 2 diabetic, these are great snacks to have on hand since they are very low in carbs. The flavor is just spicy enough to make them interesting, but is certainly not overpowering.The casing is a little tough and it does seam a little more greasy than my favorite meat snack,Jack Link's X-Stick, Original, 0.5-Ounce X-Sticks (Pack of 50), but the smaller size makes Slim Jim good for a ""pocket snack"".Recommended!CFH"
5,Quick snack on a road march.,"My Husband and his fellow soldiers love that I send snacks like the Slim-Jims because they are always appreciative of a quick, easy snack during their training exercises and on road marches. I prefer to buy in bulk, so that I know they are stocked, even temporarily. These meat sticks are thoroughly enjoyed, and the price can't be beat."
2,slim jims review,Stale and Thats unusual cause i get them all the time this time was waste of money very disappointed most likely will not recorder them because of this order which is a shame.
4,cheaper elsewhere,If you are considering buying this at amazon's regular price you can find them about four dollars cheaper at Sams club.
2,"You're Joking, Right?","You've got to be kidding. I ordered these thinking I could ""snap into a Slim Jim"" with a little extra kick. Well, the kick was there but....it was like chewing a rubber band. I just don't understand! I'll stick with the original. If it ain't broke don't fix it!"
5,awesome,i love them they are amazing I would eat them everyday if i could afford to!my kids also love them
4,Nice Snack Nice Price,"Simple snack.. I don't have much of them but it's nice to have available when I want something to snack on.. And I like the box's design since it unfolds, allows it to be carried to my office or at home"
4,Fatty yum!,"These are nice tasty treats. Very flavorful, a little spicy, and chewy, but overall good. This is a perfect snack when I don't get to eat right away.Only con I have is that a few of them had a bit too much fatty stuff b/t the meats and it kind of oozed out. It was a very weird pocket of fat and flavor in the meat."
3,"OK, but not what I'd hoped for","As a Tabasco/hot sauce lover, I had big expectations for these....but they were not to be. The flavor was...""eh,"" with barely a hint of Tabasco. And also, these things were greasy. And I don't mean the kind of greasy that you know and expect from a Slim Jim, I mean GR-EASY!Don't get me wrong, they are OK....and edible....just not what I'd hoped, and certainly not my first choice."
3,"hard, but tasty","Not chewy, actually pretty hard, but good for a snack. Your jaw will have to work on these for a while"
3,Slim Jim Chewing Gum,"The first one I bit into was tough as leather and I had to rip it with my teeth. I made the mistake of biting it in half, and then I chewed, and chewed, and chewed. I couldn't get it to break down - it was like chewing gum! For the next one, I tried stripping off the outside, but that didn't make any difference. Still tough. I found they were easier to eat if I took tiny bites.That said, they were very tasty. But I don't like to fight my food, so I won't be buying this little stick any more."
3,Good by slow,The product taste good and everything is ok. But the shipper really ships too slow. Took 5 Days for them to ship out. And took 3 days to arrive and that is with 2 days prime. WTF?
1,terrible,these are absolutely horrible. no wonder why ive never seen these in a gas station or supermarket before. They just plain suck!!!
2,very hard to chew,"lots of junks in it, many fats, lots of chicken wastes and mix with spices. only the spices is good, but i don't taste much beef in it."
3,Revenge for school torture,"I rented this movie one night, it's so funny, it's like all those John Hughes movies with a killer in it, but there is a certain satisfaction to seeing all those snobby people we all knew at school get theirs. I liked the actress who played Dawn alot I hope she does other movies she's cool. This movie has a cool website up, too, with stills from the film and pictures of the director who should be an actress, too, she's gorgeous. I'd give this a thumbs up although there wasn't the thrills of SCREAM-- it's more mental than exciting."
2,low budget horror but plot has a brain,"If this movie had more money it would have done really well, it came out before SCREAM but not in a theater. The director and the actors are unknown, but still this has an interesting story that flows, unlike so many video movies. Not enough blood, though!!"
1,Mardi Gras at it's worst,"I haven't been to Mardi Gras in a few years, but I recall much better looking guys than what appear in this dvd. Also, we keep seeing the same guys over and over. The narrater is a boring queen. Gay Mardi Gras can be a lot of fun. Rent it before you waste your money. There must be something better than this out there."
1,borrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiinnnnnnnnnnng!!!,that queen that shot this video should be de-throned and off with her head!!!! same drunk skunks over and over and probaly her!!!!! poor queen shes probaly fat and that video was her only catch!!!!
5,A worthy tribute to the New Orleans party spirit,"I am writing this a month after the Katrina catastrophe, so this video has now gotten special meaning, as it shows the original incredible party spirit of New Orleans untouched by the disaster. I'm glad a video exists that captures the Decadence of New Orleans' Mardi Gras with lots of images from the main party hotspots like Oz and the Bourbon Pub & Parade."
5,Not just for ladies,"I purchased this for my sight impaired father. He loves it. He did have a talking wrist watch, but kept forgetting to take it off when he showered or washed his hands. Naturally, it didn't last long. Plus, it wasn't loud enough for him. This pendant watch is just the thing. Oh, I didn't tell him that it's listed as a ladies pendent watch. A lot of men wear jewelry, and necklaces, and this on isn't so feminine that it would only appeal to women. It is very manly, and easy to use."
4,Excellent,"I really loved this single. I bought it when ""Hero"" first came out and really ended up liking ""Everything Fades Away"" more. I already own the Music Box CD, but I am considering buying this single just for ""Everything Fades Away."" It should have been included on one of her CD's. It's an excellent song!"
4,Its great.,"1. The LP version of hero, its a very good and inspirational song.2. A live version of hero, I like it better than the original, she sings it just enough to make it sound different, still great.3. Everything Fades Away, GREAT track. I suggest you buy it for this song, its the only place you can get it.4. Dreamlover (club joint Mix) Its the best remix of this song that she has. She re-recorded it to a faster beat. Great track, this CD is highly recommended."
5,Mariah's most beautiful B side,"I bought this cd single because of the song ""Everything fades away"". It was only released in Europe, which I never understood because it is one of the most beautiful songs Mariah has ever written. After all these years I still listen to it. I hope that sometime in the future she releases an album of all her B-sides. This is my favorite one by far."
4,Atlas shrugged,"I expect this is as good as it gets, bot lots of information with lots of maps equals some pretty small print. You have to make a real effort to follow the explanation. But, remember the atlas is representing four dimensions on only two. I use it a lot."
1,Don't buy this game,"To clarify, the key thing is don't BUY this game. It's now available to download for FREE on the Internet. The sequel is in development and the developers are allowing people to play the first one for free to get them interested in buying the sequel (something a few other developers have also done - e.g., Rockstar with GTA 2). Save yourself a few bucks."
4,Something original,"It's great to see a game that offers a unique sort of gameplay when so much that is released is just an old game with new skin. In any case, Savage is a combination of FPS fighting and RTS commanding. Teamwork is the key to victory though it can become frustrating when you have a bad commander that makes winning near impossible.One very nice feature is that the game runs on all Windows and Linux platforms without the need of any sort of patching. The development team is very mod friendly so expect to see a lot of new content as players start to design their own versions."
4,Great game that is cross platform.,"This is a hybrid game combining first person/third person shooter elements with real time strategy. One person can become the commander of the forces placing buildings while everyone else may fight on the field against the other team. There can only be one commander on each team. This game was created by S2Games, and you no longer have to purchase it (in fact it is better that you don't as this will no longer work online as the community version does). S2 Games has also released Savage2, and it too is free for download, so you should not purchase this game anymore. The game is good for LAN parties as well."
3,Works perfectly...except results vary!,"The first time I tested my blood with the Eldon card test kit, the results were clear: AB+. Great, now I finally knew my blood type, same as Marilyn Monroe, JFK, the Shroud of Turin. Kit was easy to use, fast, relatively cheap. Except it meant my mother, an O+, wasn't really my mother! So I dutifully reordered, after much anguish, and re-tested myself. The result: A+. So now I can breathe easier, astype-O can produce a type-A child, unlike with AB... but how much confidence can one have in this much-vaunted home test kit when results are not consistent? I see on the internet that there are other instances of false-B positive test results with Eldon card. My advice: Should you test positive for B and have reason to believe this to be an error, re-test. Or visit your local blood bank and donate!"
5,Easy and fast,This kit was easy to use. The lancet gave a good amount of blood and the indicators read promptly and clearly.
3,family blood testing,"I am currently doing the blood type diet for myself and wanted to see what blood type the rest of the family was,so we didn't have conflict.so i bought these , they were way more expensive then they are worth.I already knew my blood type so i was the control. yep it came out right for meso we did the rest of the family,when they all turned out the same we got quite suspicious,does it ever come out with anything other than A+?? we wondered. I was trying to save the cost of going to the doctor's to get typed because of the cost. so now we still don't know if its right. they should include an extra set to make sure.not sure if we were satisfied on this product or not.time will tell."
5,Works as advertised.,I read the instructions carefully a couple of times and followed them exactly and it worked as advertised. It clearly showed my blood type based on two of the four circles coagulating.
2,NEEDS A 2ND LANCET!,"Yes, the instructions are easy to follow, and yes, the test is very accurate (assuming you can get a enough blood). UNFORTUNATELY, I couldn't get enough blood (despite warming hands, despite picking the thin-skinned side of my finger, despite squeezing) with that pathetic, one-shot lancet they put in. No, I'm not a retard - I've use similar kits other times. Problem with this is: you need 4 big drops, but the single lancet they provide is too small and one shot. Thus, they need to put in a 2nd or 3rd lancet. I ended up having to poke myself with a needle a couple times (which is much more painful than you think!) to get enough blood."
1,The Worst Product Ever,I did not like this product because it was very hard to understand the instructions. I felt like I wasted my hard earned money on a useless product. Thanks for Nathing and I gave it one star cause I couldn't choose zero star..
1,Didn't work for me,I went against the reviews and tried this... I did everything correctly but my results could not be determined.... Everything works as said but nothing showed except smeared blood that looked exactly the same in each circle??
1,Did Not Work!,The lancet was broken or very flimsy. It would be a better idea to get your blood tested at a blood bank or at your doctor's office.
1,must be user error with my case,my results don't match anything on the card....my guess would be A or O negative because all circles look the same. i was really hoping to know my blood type. i don't think i used enough blood? i tried to watch the video on website but it stops half way thru so i never saw how much to use.
1,Unreliable,"Buyer beware, this product is unreliable and shouldn't be used for any medical purposes. I bought two of these because I needed to know what my blood type was for work, both cards I used gave me a blood type result of A Negative. When I was finally able to get my doctor's office to order the blood type test for me I was surprised to find out my blood type was actually A Positive."
1,Worthless,"Lancet came broken only included one. So was reduced to sticking my finger with a pin. All the circles looked the same, and gave me zero results. Worthless."
1,Disappointed,Maybe I received a bad lot. When running the test it was not apparent what the blood type was based on the display. The reading was barely discernable. To make a determination it really was more guesswork than blatantly clear. Glad this wasn't for a transfusion!
3,Okay Product,"I purchased two of this product, and the first kit was a disaster when my husband used it, his needle did not work and when i used my kit, I ran out of blood to finish, so my test was incomplete. I think the worse part of this kit is the fact that the needle is a one time use only, so if your blood clots halfway through like mine did, you are out of luck, unless you are into self mutilation which I am not. I recommend having a back up way to draw blood because these needles either don't work and they are only 1x use only."
5,easy and not too painful,"I had to really psych myself up to use the lancets, and barely got a drop of blood using either one. But the test appeared to work properly with a minimum sample, and my fingertips stopped throbbing later that day. OK I'm a sissy."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I followed the instructions, got an 'invalid' result and wasted my money. There should be a way to try again if the result is 'invalid'."
5,Now I know my blood type (B+),"I bought this kit because I was interested in determining my blood type myself, since I am unable to donate blood and can't afford to pay a doctor to do the test. Since each kit only comes with one Eldon Card I decided to buy two kits, so I would have a spare just in case I messed it up somehow the first time around. Everything was easy to use, the directions were concise (though I definitely recommend familiarizing yourself with the entire procedure before you start), and both kits quickly yielded the same clearly distinguishable result.."
4,"Worked well, i ""think"" it's accurate...","Got the kit very quickly, followed the easy instructions and ran into one snang... when I went to prick my finger with the lancet it said to push it down against finger, i was pushing pretty hard but nothing happened. I held the lancet away from my skin in one hand and manually pressed the white thing all the way down and a needle popped out and disappeared. I had to break the lancet into a couple of pieces to find the needle then poked my finger manually and did what it asked and the results showed up quickly. I think two sheets should be included just so you could check for accuracy but they only include one.I'm a A positive blood type and now I'm in a bad mood because I just found out to be healthy I basically need to avoid meat and become a vegetarian: /"
5,Works rather well - pretty neat! (B Positive),"For the price and apparent simplicity, I was admittedly a little skeptical about the conclusive accuracy of this home blood typing system. After receiving my kit and performing the test, I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity of its results. Granted results (disregarding actual blood type) are obviously going to vary among individuals, mine weren't ambiguous at all. Even the ""weak agglutination"" was readily distinguishable, relative to the ""control"" smear.It's a pretty simple matter of reading/following the directions carefully and avoiding contamination, although I do wish the kit came with a second Eldon Card for the sake of confirmation or potential error. Other than that, I do suggest being proficient with the procedure beforehand (as opposed to following along) so as to avoid premature coagulation.A very interesting, simple, and informative little experiment. I'm apparently ""B Positive,"" which is nice to know."
4,Easy to use,"This test kit was easy to use and easy to understand.Important to really warm up your hand and get enough blood flow before using the lancet. I would suggest there was a second lancet in the pack, just in case.But overall super easy - just follow all the steps."
1,We've got a bleeder...or not,"Yes, I'm giving it a low review because it did not work for me, but it's not for lack of trying or ability to follow instructions. First of all, the lancing device did not work; I twisted, I pulled, I pushed- there was no needle. It must have broken off with the cap. Luckily, I have a diabetes test kit and used the lancing device from my own kit. Still, I simply could not get enough blood flowing out to do the test. Maybe I just don't bleed very well, but I usually have no problem testing for my blood-sugar level. Eldoncard's test does ask for a whole lot of blood. And a working lancing device would have been nice. In the end, it was money wasted."
1,Piece of garbage,I couldn't even get enough blood out to complete the test which means that I never received the results from the test. All of the equipment that comes with this kit is cheap and ineffective. Don't waiste your time.
1,Too Abbreviated,This book is only helpful for those who already have a solid foundation in Topology. It is a good quick-reference guide but the explanations are too short to provide any self-teaching capability. This book has no solutions to problems and most of them are ambiguous proofs with limited examples to help. Graphs and pictures are limited. I would expect books for math theory to have plenty of visualizations instead of expecting students to understand the overlapping and increasing jargon on every page.
2,"Poorly written, poorly edited, difficult to follow","I have only been using this book for a few weeks for my undergraduate Biophysics class and I already hate it. It is extremely wordy, does not do a good job at highlighting the key concepts, is difficult to find a specific topic that you are interested in, is inconsistent with itself (it will vary the name that it calls a specific theory or equation), and has an index that is far from helpful. I spend more time flipping through the chapter trying to figure out where the topic is that the homework problem references than I do actually solving the problem.I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does contain a lot of information. That information is presented in a way that makes it extremely difficult to learn from and produces a lot of frustration on the part of the reader. If you are a professor reading this, please find a different book. Your students will thank you."
1,horrible,"This is the worst textbook I have ever had!!!!!It is difficult to read, full of errors, and has little or no introduction into any of the topics. In the class I'm taking, even the chemistry majors are having trouble. Don't bother buying this book. It's not worth the money!- MS grad student in bioinformatics, Boston University"
4,Very good!,"With Cantor & Schimmel close to 20 years old, it's good to have a ""modernized"" text for biophysical chemistry. This book uses quite a bit of complicated mathematics; however, if you know ordinary & partial differential equations along with linear algebra and complex variables, you will be fine. The author's even suggest a review of mathematics for physical chemists in their introduction. Although some sections from Cantor & Schimmel are not ""updated"" (eg molecular orbital symmetry and dipole operators"", the book makes good on LD and CD along with a strong section on transition dipoles and dipole-dipole interactions. I would recommend it although the price $81 (at least when I purchased it) is a little steep."
1,Painful,If you have to take P. Chem for your degree and you're not a Chem major - pray you don't get this book. Atkins and Tinoco are far simpler and easier to read. It really seems like van Holde enjoys making his discussion as complicated as possible.P. Chem is bad enough - this book only makes it worse.
1,HORRIBLE TEXTBOOK,"I am a chem major at Duke University and we used this book in my biophysical chem class. The book is all around horrible. It doesn't introduce topics at all- just jumps right in and assumes an depth knowledge about chemistry, physics, biology. There are no sample problems worked out at all, and even though some answers are in the back of the text it's hard to know how they arrived at the answer without any examples to look at. The book is dense and difficult to read, and other books like Cantor and Schimmel are much more readable and helpful. This book presents all the topics, but still left me confused and not understanding the topics indepth enough."
4,general book,"This book is a short survey of modern biophysics. Indeed, some chapters in this book have very general character and very often the knowledge presented in these chapters is not deep enough. Size of this book, which was published in one volume only is its biggest limitation, because presented subject is very wide and consists of many different scientific disciplines.Anyway this book can be regarded as a good overview of the very wide and diverse subject. I really do not understand why so many people complain here so much.This is book about the principles of biophysics."
1,The Official U.S. Mint 50 State Quarters: Complete 100 Hole,"I was disappointed in this product. The cover lillustration is nice but the book itself was a quite thin and flimsy cardboard. In addition, our son has trouble getting the quarters into the holes. After putting only about half of the quarters in, the book looks battered and worn. I would suggest looking for something better made."
1,Product poorly designed,The quarter folder holder is quite poorly designed. I cannot even figure out how to insert the quarters in their slots.
4,Nice book if you want all 100 quarters,"The book has 4 pages to hold the quarters, 2 pages on the left for the P mint and the 2 pages on the right for the Denver mint. There are additional pages listing the states and some facts such as population and size. Another page lists US Presidents through G.W. Bush.I have seen other books the size of a road atlas with more information that hold 50 quarters, good if you don't care about the mints."
4,collector's folder..,"I bought one of these books a month ago, it works great. I had been collecting the quarters for years for my grandchildren's graduations, and finally decided to put them all in books so I ordered 5 more books. The quarters fit snug but they do stay in and it is a nice book for the price."
2,Too flimsy,"Beautiful front panel can be easily punctured into a coin holder on reverse side accidentally. This is because the cover material is too thin. Other than poor ""structural integrity"", it is a beautiful and informative item."
2,"Looks great, works so-so","I just purchased three different 50 State Quarters books to try as the quarters fall out of the one I have. The other reviewers who weren't happy with this item are spot on. This is the worst of the three.It looks great and has a lot of useful information about each state and the order of release. But the holes are too small though I didn't need a hammer to push the quarters in. It's clear given the tight holes and the force needed to get the quarters in that it would only be a matter of time before I ripped through the paper thin cover.This is personal taste, but I don't like that the P and D are in totally separate groups rather than having both coins for each state together."
2,Coin Book,"The book came as promised but the creases where the pages fold were all ripped. I was pretty dissatisfied with the condition, but whatever"
4,ME who did the album with Ella,"I was cut off at the pass and couldn't finish my review - my work was ""6 months better' on Rodgerts & Hart so I only give this one - the biggest seller of the two - only 4 stars and R&H; 5 stars!Time flies when one is writing their own review of their album!!!Buddy Bregman"
4,Pleased with Gravy Pitcher,Overall I like the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Gravy/Sauce Pitcher. It is a little Christmasy but I decided to use it anyway outside of the holidays. The size is great. I do not need to leave the table to refill the gravy during a Sunday meal. It does drip some around the edges when pouring. It would be nice to have a small plate under it. I recommend this product.
4,Larger than needed,This gravy server is quite large and therefore heavy. However I wanted a one piece instead of two. I'm sure I'll find other uses for this piece.
2,Holmes Tower Fan Is Ok,"While it looks ok I was pretty dissapointed. It does not have enough power, even on high I don't think it blows enough to cool off a room. Amazon was cool enough though to accept my return and pay for return shipping."
1,Holmes Tower Fan,"Bought this yesterday at Target. Am going to return it this week. The base is difficult to put together..my husband can put anything together and this took him a half hour. I get more breeze out of my little floor vornado fan than this.I like Holmes products in general, I have their air purifiers which work great but this fan is a bust."
4,FANtastic,"Pros:1.) Great value2.) 3 speeds and the option to oscillate or not3.) Slim Design4.) Relatively quiet...even at the highest speedCons:1.) Doesn't push a lot of air2.) Need to keep it close to you to feel the airOverall: A great fan for the price. Circulates enough air to cool a small room, but if you really want to keep cool, keep it roughly 2-4 feet away from you. Definitely worth buying if you're looking for an inexpensive tower fan."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this fan on sale for $20 but it is not even worth $20. I rather put a little extra and find something that works! You have to sit right next to it to feel any air. For it to work effectively, you have to either put it in a really small space (5 by 5 room max (like office space)) or leave it running all the time on highest setting to feel any difference. Total waste of money. Planning to return it and get something better."
1,Piece of junk,"Just bought this fan at Target and after 40 minutes of trying to attach the base, I see why they're on sale for $25. What a flimsy piece of junk! There's a fuse that's supposed to go inside the electrical plug and I can't see how or where to close the cover! I'm returning it tomorrow."
2,Returning - Not a good fan,"I just bought this fan from Target. I was a little worried that this fan is half the price of other tower fans but thought I'd give it a try. Even on the highest setting there's barely a substantial breeze from the fan. The noise is the worst part, it's like a noisy refrigerator motor. Not worth it."
1,Sad fan!,This fan is very noisy and moves very little air. If I had the box I would be returning it!
1,Truckstop noise,This little fan is all show and no blow. It must be imbalanced since it vibrates and roars when set to HIGH... but not much air gets moved.A perfect fan for those who need to recreate the sound of a refrigerator-truck.
3,Does the job,"Its Ok. A little Loud, and I would prefer for a samller room, I have it in my living room."
5,Tower Fans Rule!,"I bought a tower fan last year for downstairs and now bought one for upstairs. No more heavy, clumsy box fans for me. Tower Fans are the best!"
4,Nice hand towel to keep colds at bay.,"No, there's nothing ""magical"" per se about these Wamsutta towels. The colors are pretty and don't run in the wash. They are soft, well-made (no strings or fraying so far), and a generous size.The thing I like about them, aside from the quality, is the PRICE. They're so inexpensive you can stock up and change the towel a few times a day if needed. So when one member of the family gets a cold, you have a ton of hand towels to keep the sick one from spreading the germs to the rest of you.Ever since I started buying up hand towels and assigning the color-coded towels to the husband and kids, the incidence of colds and other ailments as dropped dramatically. It's so nice to know that it isn't fated that one kid with the sniffles must spread it to everyone else!Yeah, it's a little thing, changing the hand towels all the time. But I can vouch that it's a great way to keep down the spread of germs and keep the family healthy.Stock up at these prices!"
4,Yellow Roses,"Testimonies of girls who have suffered the consequences of a fast paced world, peer pressures, sexual abuse, inner emptiness, plastic values. It was a touching, sad, emotional and realistic film that at the end brings testimonies of hope, restauration and joy."
2,Nice graphics but this game is a step backward,"This game has spectatular graphics, but every other aspect of the game falls short. The gameplay takes FOREVER. It is turn-based but the incremental change in cities and hero levels changes extremely slowly. High level units cost a fortune and take several turns to be created. The economy is horrid. The only way to gain gold is via cities. No gold is given for kills. One of the biggest disappointments is that your main character is confined to your main city. The character's powers are amplified by the character's wizard tower. You cannot cast spells in battle if you are not with your hero or not at your tower."
3,tales of kidd funky,"this album was like a collection of B sides of unreleased material, its for the true rock/funkateers if your looking for more main stream funk this one might not be for you"
3,Ruined by 2 songs..,"Can someone please explain to me why the best songs on here are too short,while the most annoying songs-Take Your Dead Ass Home & the title track are too long?I can listen to other Funkadelic albums like Maggot Brain or One Nation Under A Groove all the way through without a need to skip,but not this one.And the fact that Let's Take It To The People is less than 2 minutes is a crime!"
3,Frosty Review,I needed the song Frosty the Snowman for a theme song for our holiday party. This version was really for children and the party was all adults. Kids would love this CD.
2,Asylum Studio.....slowly beginning to see the light.,"Asylum Studios, makers of the worst movies is slowly starting ...and i mean slowlystarting to make viewable films...Most of them are really really really bad, butthis one...there is a grain of hope...is not too bad. The story...hummm...butthe creatures and the flow of the action sequences are worth wathching.This is the first time that i had the patience to watch a whole feature fromthis studio."
3,Come on....,"BIG CRAAAAB! A crab just stole my money! Come on...its asylum! What can you expect other than great movies that touch your heart. Honestly, a decent movie to have some beers with some buddies who also want to suffer and make jokes that will be brought up at future occasions."
3,Just too big and Bulky,"I love to take photos and efter my new sony got soaked in St. John I decided to invest in this product. When It came it looked like some science fiction contraption. Way to bulky and complicated for me. It was a serious device for underwater photography, and too much for my needs. I have opted for a zip lock bag. Right Product , but the wrong person so I returned it"
5,Great buy,Same product at a better price. What's not to like? Definitely a great addition to my army. Recommended highly if you're considering it
2,Not impressed,"We own JD for kids vol 1 & 2 and love to watch them with our 3 YO son so this Christmas we gave him vol 3 & 4 and were very disappointed with both but especially vol 4. There is a large picture of a combine plus a cotton stripper on the front cover. Unfortunatly, neither appear in this video!! There is probably less than 5% of the DVD that is modern farm equipment. It is primarily about a two cylinder expo and a JD train/miniature farm scene. Neither of which I dislike but was just very disappointed that there was such a miniscule amount of modern farm equipment. The cover picture is misleading."
5,Excellent kids film,"My kids love this John Deere series! Kids are 5,3 and 1. Even my 3 year old daughter loves the movie!"
5,Great action for tractor lovers of any age!,My 2 now 3yr old son is nuts over these tractor shows. We have the whole collection pt 1-4 and many other selections. He watches daily along with dad or whoever will sit it for the ride. Educational too! I have even picked up a little tractor knowledge myself. My father-in-law loves them too. Great buy for little boys of any age. Music and fast action fun.
1,Not what I expected,"Received the plants in a timely manner but tried to grow all them hydroponically and only 3 strong plants started within a week and the final 3 are just now taking. Therefore out of 12 plants, I had to discard 6. I emailed the seller about a week ago and no response. So I will not be ordering anymore items from this seller and I will be looking into strictly Organic seed and plants since they thrive the most without hesitation!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,RECEIVED PACKAGE WITH ALL PLANTS VERY WET AND FULL OF MILDEW. NO INFORMATION INSIDE PACKAGE; NO RETURN ADDRESS ON PACKAGE. UNABLE TO USE PRODUCT. IT WAS SPOILED AND NOT USABLE.
5,Good Service,"Received the plants rapidly, well wrapped and still moist. Planted them and now I'm waiting for them to sprout!"
3,Just a box with bare roots in a generic zip loc bag.,"I ordered this product with great expectations.... I got a box with bare roots in a generic zip loc bag. NO PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS! NO TIPS, NO INFORMATION. NO LABEL.... I know they are strawberry plants....but what variety...I am left to Guess. No Problem... I'll just look on the website... NOTHING for Planting or growing instructions.... No Problem... I'll Call them.... The phone just rang and rang and finally a fax picked up screaming at me those wonderful tones. If my $5.44 for shipping and handling wasn't enough to cover an instruction sheet and I can get through for help.... I think next time I will buy locally.UPDATE 3-22-12:OK I did some surfing and found a site that recommended soaking the bare-roots... Did that for 3 hours in a miracle-grow and water bath... Planted the roots and the next morning saw new growth on all 10 plants. Would have preferred some instructions from the grower... but so far I am happy with the results."
5,Beautiful,"I have not tasted these yet, but they are florishing in my garden. I lost 4 plants due to the weather, but if they are everbearing I am sure I will have tons of strawberries. Thanks HirtsBlack Sea Man Tomato 10 Seeds - Heirloom"
2,strawberries,I had a lot of lost plants. Not sure if it was the way they were planted or the plants.
1,50 Evie Everbearing Strawberry Plants - BEST BERRY! - Bare Root Plants,"Planted, watered, fertilized!! I have 3 plants left living! I should have saved my money and bought fresh berries at the grocery store! Do not buy from this company!!"
5,Looks bad at first Does Great days after,"Bought these to plant before winter frost so I could have a nice little strawberry patch next spring. Shipping was fast. They came in all bundled to each other and dried out looking. I separated them and planted they day after I got them. Within 3-4 days there was new growth on all 25 plants, and now they are all around 3-4 inches tall. I would highly recommend these to get your strawberry plant started with little hassle."
3,Everbearing Strawberries fall short,"I ordered the 50 plants and expected a 10% loss. What I actually ended up with is closer to a 25% loss and I find that disappointing. While I agree that the plants were not much to look at when they arrived, only about 37 of them actually had any type of green crown on them. The rest were strickly a dead root that did nothing even after I planted them as per the Seller's suggestion."
5,Evie Everbearing Strawberry Plants,"I bought these plants from Hirt's Gardens.They came from USPS mail in a zip-lock bag.I soaked them in water for 30 minutes.I planted them each in medium- sized pots at first.After they got a little bigger, I planted them in my backyard.2 plants died, but the rest are very healthy.The strawberries are extremely sweet and big.I hope I can have more plants by planting the runners.Overall, these are great plants!!!!!!"
5,Grows like a weed (a good thing of course!),"I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure to soak the roots in water for 1-2 days before planting them - every single one survived. I got a pack of 25 but in reality some of them were conjoined with smaller new buds, so I was actually able to plant 28 or so. It's been about two months and they've been growing like crazy, with plenty of new leaves and runners, even a handful of new plants are starting to establish.The first berry just turned red yesterday, yay! It's not big (understandable since the climate here is relatively cool and they are young plants after all) but I'm sure that'll get better next year."
2,They all died,"I bought these hoping to not have to buy strawberries at the store anymore. The did thrive at first when soaked and then I planted it and it was green for several weeks. Then everything turned brown yet I was not watering less and I had not moved the plants. It may be more me than the plants, but I won't repurchase."
3,Strawberry plants,"So far my strawberry plants are doing well. Four or five of them died (I was hoping they would all make it), but overall I'm pleased."
3,Hirts doesn't care enough to even reply :(,"I ordered a 10 pack of the Everbearing Strawberry plants a few weeks ago.I received only 9 plants :(Those ""9"" plants were in good shape btw.Sent them a message and got NO reply.It's bad enough that I got short changed, but by not replying you send the message that you don't give a damn either.I will NOT order again from Hirts.Wish I could remove my feedback rating I gave them in advance figuring they would at least reply / pretend to care."
3,The name is a misnomer,"The 10 plants all grew. That does not mean they produced strawberries. From 10 plants, I had a total of 15 edible strawberries. Not great! Non like the picture. The foliage was lush and full. There were a lot of runners, a lot of flowers, but little fruit. I followed the instructions with some variation, in that I used the fiber hanging pots.Perhaps next season they will produce more berries."
1,pitiful,these things came looking dead and still is dead waste of money don't waste your money I'am giving up on these thing once and for all
5,looks to be doing well,"I purchased these to go in a topsy turvy I bought on sale last fall.I know little about growing stuff.after planting these, within 2 days everyone of them has visible new growth -- I didn't think plants could grow so fast!"
3,Neutral,"Much like other customers, I received 25 dried out plants in a small bundle in a plastic zip lock bag. No green on them at all and was worried about if they would live. I have placed in water like others have said to do and so far they seem to be showing signs of life. Starting to grow green leaves. I will leave in water a couple more days and then plant in garden. Looks like it just takes some water to perk the plants up after shipping. A bit smaller than I expected, but overall looks like they should be an alright product."
5,Stroke,"I purchased these plants at the end of May and as others have stated, they came bundled in newspaper and looked a bit frazzled. But, before ordering, I read some reviews that mentioned soaking them for a day or so in water, which I did. I'd have to say that it was only a matter of a day or two at the most that I started to see growth. Within a week flowers started to appear and a short time after that, a few berries emerged. The plants are very healthy and the berries are coming. Runners have also started. Out of 26 plants, 25 made it and are doing well. I would definitely buy these plants again. I wonder if someone could advise me on long term care for the plants? I've gotten conflicting info about the runners and what to do with the plants after they mature."
5,Easy and quick way to get a jump on planting time,"This order came packaged very well. There were approximately 32 plants in bare moist root package. I was glad to see extras because I lost 4or 5 due to something I may have done during the initial hardening off period. However, I gave each a (root) haircut and planted as instructed. They are now about 6-8 inches wide and high (after about 45 days) and I had strawberries setting up in about a week or two. They are growing well and will order again soon and I highly recommend."
2,not eco drive,I was so excited to get this as a gift for my husband. He's had lots of trouble with the batteries in his other citizen watch. When the watch arrived I learned it was not an eco-drive watch as advertised. Nice looking watch but not what I wanted. This was false advertising.
3,Bom cronografo,"Comprei este relogio para substituir dois outros modelos semelhantes da Citizen e que duraram 15 anos sem qualquer manuteno a no ser troca das baterias. O diametro do relogio se mostrou um pouco pequeno para meu pulso, mas esse era um item que eu ja sabia - no foi surpresa. No mais o relogio é preciso e muito bonito, sóbrio, sem aquelas alegorias que outros modelos de fabricantes diversos teimam em 'desenvolver'.Se existe uma coisa que poderia ser mudada é o tamanho do acumulador de minutos, que em vez de acumular 60 minutos em um mostrador to pequeno, poderia acumular somente 30 minutos, facilitando em muito a leitura. O acumulo no outro mostrador seria progressivo , de 30 em 30 minutos .Essa caracteristica existe em modelos da Zodiac, Breitling Navitimer, Omega Speedmaster e no seria um fator de aumento de preo."
5,Just beautiful,This is some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard in any genre. It feels as close to perfection (or as close to God) as I have ever felt listening to music.
3,MONO not STEREO,"The biggest revelation about this Japanese reissue for the first time on CD complete is that those responsible for issuing this session released it in it's MONO form, not STEREO. When originally released in 1959 in LP form, STEREO was available; I know I own the record in its STEREO configuration and the sound quality is exceptional for an LP from this period. Therefore, it is curious why the MONO version was chosen, and not the STEREO version, for release on CD at this time.With this said, the CD sound quality is enjoyable enough."
4,Works well,"I know the circuit for my amp was also the same circuit for some of the kitchen appliances, even though the amp was in another room. I never would have my house wired like that if were a custom home. Anyway, this gets rid of most of the hum. Seems pricey, though."
5,EXCELLENT,I have a three amp rig with a Morley ABC switch that caused a BAD ground loop noise and the Hum X perfectly removed it! Worth every $.
5,Life saver in a little plug,I run a DJ business and just switched to using a laptop and powered speakers. I was getting an awful loud buzzing noise coming from my speakers. I read in another review that my Dell Volstra laptop had a ground problem and created a ground loop. I never would have thought it would happen. I unplugged the power supply and ran off the battery and it was noise free. I plugged in the power supply again and it Buzzed again.I bought the hum X and it safely kept my ground an stopped the buzz. Well worth the money. AAA+++
2,HUM X,"I bought this item to break the feedback we were getting with a powered speaker that was picking up a nearby radio station. The building we are in has an electrical system that seems to be acting as an antenna that picks up the local radio station. Although faint, just hearing this broadcast while trying to use the speaker is anoying enough that it causes us to turn off the speaker. The Hum X was supposed to break such interfearance (or so I thought) but it hasn't fixed our problem."
1,100% won't work to reduce 60 hz hum from Dimmer Switches,"Dimmer switches are notorious generators of electromagnetic interference. The Hum X is described as: ""The easiest, safest way to get rid of ground loop hum."" Well if you are looking to get rid of the hum coming from your guitar amplifier and you can any turned on dimmer switches within 30 feet of your amplifier, than this doesn't reduce that dimmer switch hum by the smallest bit. There is no difference at all. It works for most people because they are using it to get rid of simple ground loop hum involving basic electrical interference. For 70$ it should at least make some kind of difference right? Even if it does work, it's very overpriced."
1,Didn't work for me,"The Ebtech HumX didn't do anything for me.My home theater subwoofer buzzes when it is powered up. The loudness of the buzz changes depending on where I plug it in. This sounds like a classic ground loop problem to me.I bought the HumX and it didn't do a thing. Absolutely no change.Now I am stuck with the chore of filling out a form, getting a return number from the manufacturer, paying their restocking fee, and making a trip to the post office (paying the return postage myself). That is almost as annoying as my noisy subwoofer."
1,Ho-Hum Plug,"I had a ground loop hum in my home theater system. The projector was plugged in about 30 feet away from the rest of the home theater system, so I bought this Hum X Plug to try to break the ground loop.I plugged the projector into the Hum X Plug as directed and there was no difference at all."
2,Very Disappointed,"Item does not work. Tried on two tube amps, one foreign manufacture and one domestic. Zero results. There is absolutely no removal of amplifier noise (60 cycle hum or ground loop hum) or whatever the term is. Evidently this product is only snake oil. I really do not like being taken advantage of, and the misrepresentation of this product accomplished just that. I will think long and hard before I try another product from Amazon as this is totally misrepresented. I realize that a large company such as Amazon has logistical difficulties, but the product should have been tested before it was put in the catalog offering. This product will serve as a reminder to me, not to purchase any product without personally testing same. This is not possible while ordering online, so I will not order anymore products from Amazon."
1,Ground loop problem,"I am about to buy the Ebtech HumX hoping to sovle a ground loop problem from my computer. Question is if I socket the HumX to the wall, is it possible to connect an ac distriburor to the humx then hock up all my dj equipment including my computer. Second qustion- can I use a ground loop b/w sound card and mixer simultaniously with the Humx? P/L urgent reply needed"
3,doesn't eliminate the hum,"Not sure if the product is working properly, because the hum in my set up is still there. The hum is probably due one or more of the dimmers in the house, which this product may not be designed to eliminate (although I thought and hoped it would)."
1,It didn't do what it was supposed to do,"I've heard that some people have used this product with great results, but it did absolutely nothing to eliminate a hum problem I was having. So I gave it to a friend of mine who is a pro guitar tech to see if it might work for him."
5,It works pretty well,"I bought the HumX to deal with an annoying buzz in my new sub-woofer, most likely caused by a ground loop.HumX eliminated the noise and i've had no problems for the 1 month + of ownership of this product.Thankfully it worked for me. I hope it works for you, and if it doesn't ... Amazon.com is great at handling returns painlessly.."
5,"Simple, works","A friend had one of these. We were a travelling band, and I would run the sound board for them.In about a third of the venues we went to, we invariably ran into nasty ground hum issues since the mixer would be on a circuit breaker for the back of the room, and the guitar amps would be on a circuit breaker for the front of the room. Maybe we just had noisy and used equipment, but the HumX always solved our problem once we found which equipment to use it on.My only problem with it was we only had one, and there were times I wish we had three. The price could be better though."
4,Does what it says! Albeit a tad pricey.,"My gear:- Dell Studio Laptop running Serato Itch- Vestax VCI-300 USB DJ controller- QSC K10 Loudspeakers- 1/4"" TS cables (connecting the Vestax directly to the QSC speakers)When connected all together, there was a noticeable hum coming from the speakers. I contacted Ebtech and they recommended this device. So I bought one and sure enough, when I plugged one of my speakers into the Hum X and then into the wall, the hum stopped.I am taking off one star simply due to the high-price. This really should sell for $40-$50 tops, in my opinion."
4,Skaneas,"This product performs as specified, but is limited to 6 Amps and this was not described on the listed details on the website. This may affect its log-term function."
2,Hum X Ground Loop,"Bought it, tried it, the hum got worse. Did not eliminate ground loop on my sub. Sent it back. End of story."
5,Fixed whine in computer speakers,"I was skeptical about this product. But it worked to remove an annoying whine in my computer speakers when my graphics card was under load. I even bought an external sound card, Presonus Firebox, to help with the whine but it didn't stop it in the least. In fact, I just heard the whine more clearly.I have no idea how or why it works. But it worked perfectly for me."
4,Worked fine for me.,"I replaced the electronics in my sub-woofer in my home theater system and had a very bad ground loop hum. With zero input to the sub, the volume control on the sub had to be almost off to not hear the hum. At any useful volume setting the hum made it unusable.After reading the reviews here, I tried the experiment of using a 2-prong adapter - The hum went away. So, I decided to take a chance and ordered the humX. It took care of the hum just fine, maybe even better than using the 2-prong adapter but without the risk of leaving the equipment ungrounded. I must say, this was better than I expected.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the price. The profit margin on this thing must be tremendous. Maybe it is part of the marketing strategy, since if were priced at $15 everyone would think, ""Something that cheap cannot work."" and wouldn't even give it a try.Bottom line, it did what it claimed and I am glad I bought it."
4,DVD Workshop - opinion on Ulead trial version,"I've used the DVD Workshop Trial Edition for about 20 days now and it seems to be a great value...I've produced 2 DVDs with it from my home movies. It's highly customizable, allows video backgrounds for menu screens, supports background music, and makes setting chapter points a breeze. I've had a few problems with the Trial version and like many other Ulead customers I can't say their customer support is very good - I think they are overwhelmed. That's not to say the product is buggy, just that the few problems it has aren't intuitive to resolve. DVD MovieFactory, also from Ulead, is their entry level version of this product...I do plan to purchase DVD Workshop when my trial expires."
4,Fast and Flexible,"I produced a Video CD within 2.5 hours with this software on my first go. My Video CD included 4 photo album slide shows (20 pictures each), 3 video clips, and 3 menus - all with background music. I can't believe how easy it was. The interface is simple to use. At first, I thought it may not be very flexible because of its simple interface but what it provides seems to be all that one needs. This is a great all-in-one application that replaces all my previous VCD authoring software, such as the Philips VCD toolkit, the endless media conversion tools, and the CD-R burning application."
1,Don't bother,"For the price, this product is definitely not worth it. The help files included are a joke. I was having trouble with dropped frames, so I looked under dropped frames and it says ""Displays the total number of frames that were dropped or lost during capture. "" It doesn't say a thing regarding an explanation what causes dropped frames or how to resolve the issue. This software reminds me of the stuff you would find in the discount rack in a jewel case for ... at your local computer superstore..."
2,Barry Allen Flash should have been the title,If you love Barry Allen as the Flash this is the book for you! I never was that attached to him. I'm plodding through this book and it's all about his perspective. Crisis was a great series from so many perspectives but this book is a Flash-sentric book.If you never cared that much about Flash then this is definitely not the book for you!
2,"""Some assembly required""","Remember that old joke about Dad putting together a bicycle on Christmas Day? Yeah, that's pretty much how I felt about this toy. The bottom 1/3 is a fold-out plastic box, while the upper 2/3 is just a vinyl backdrop. If you're used to assembling tents and semi-prebuilt furniture, you won't have a problem with putting this together. However, don't expect a young child to be able to assemble it, and, as the toy is marketed towards being transportable when unassembled, the idea of a parent repeatedly reassembling this playset every time junior totes it along with him doesn't particularly thrill me. The toy also comes with a single-projectile shooter (which may be lost), a thread rope for Batman to swing from, and a chute to fall through. Batman himself comes with multiple points of articulation (head, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, neck). Save yourself the pain of assembling this set and buy a higher-end model."
2,Not impressed,Either I don't know how to properly use this or it simply is not as easy and quick as the canine teeth type old fashioned staple remover. I don't like it.
5,Love this Gadget!,I love this gadget! It does not only eliminate the hassle of taking the staple wire out but it also holds the wire with its magnetic power. Very handy and its shapely contour makes it more convenient to use. I highly recommend this product.
1,Wasn't able to use it,Tried it at work but it didn't work on the staples..staples are stronger than the remover..so i ordered another item..
5,Teacher's best friend,"As an elementary teacher, I am forever in the process of stapling things to walls--which of course later leads to the necessity of removing those staples. So I figured it was about time to stop using everything else under the sun to pull those staples from the wall and buy an actual staple remover that would work for walls.I went with this one seeing it had good reviews. However, I had to wonder why in the world this thing was magnetic. Did it handily stick to my board or something? What real perk was that? No, the magnet just makes it that much easier to remove a staple. Trust me, it works wonders I never thought possible.I also like the handle. It looks nice and feels nice in the hand.Great staple remover at a great price."
5,excellent tool,had received one for a gift and bought three more for other people who were borrowing
4,"Nice grip, works fine, modern look","I bought 3 to compare - so I could buy for the full office. Items compared: Bostitch Preium Chrome $6.00 thumbs down - is thin and has the worse grip -it went right into the garbage ); Bostitch Professional Magnetic Staple Remover, Black (40000M-BLK) $5.37 (nice grip, chosen by our engineers as best of three); Westcott Titanium Bonded Staple Remover ($4.83 also nice grip, but its thickness makes it less comfortable to hold - little hands would like the Bostitch pro magnetic one better. But I can't find anything magnetic about this one!"
4,saves my nails!,"I use this to remove staples from bulletin boards, and occasionally to separate packets. I love it! Great for teachers."
4,Great item BUT outrageous shipping charges,"For items that weigh less than a ballpoint pen, the cost of the shipping was more than double the cost of the items ... shipping for 4 cost almost $20! AND, this information was NOT available on the site at the time of the order ... only a combined shipping charge was available at the time of order! VERY OUTRAGEOUS!"
5,Will leave you shaken and stirred!,This cd combines amazing jazz with the coolness of the old school James Bond Era of the 60's. It's the perfect music for any occasion. You will not be dissappointed!
3,Interesting...,"Nice book..but its a duplicate of ""To the One Person I Consider to Be My Soul Mate"". If u have the book mentioned...u wouldnt wanna get this copy...I give the cover 3 stars though:o)"
1,WARNING-Battery exploded while charging,"I see that Amazon currently states this item is not available and not sure if it ever will be again. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM if you do find it somewhere else, I was charging the item for an overseas vacation and I woke to the sound of loud popping, the battery had exploded and burning wires. The fire department was called and said that I was very lucky the house hadn't caught fire. I purchased this item at Toys'R'US, good thing my children weren't watching it at the time. There should be a recall on this item."
1,JUNK!,"What a peice of junk. We bought this for our son for Christmas. He got to watch 2 movies on it before it crapped out. At first the screen went blank but the sound worked, now nothing works at all when you turn it on. I contacted Craig and they advised me to return it but Toys R Us will not refund my money since I purchased it in Oct. due to a promotional deal. Why should I be treated like this considering I dropped $120 on this junk. Toys R Us just lost a customer."
4,Great DVD Player,"I bought this for an upcoming road trip but we did test it out in the car on a short trip. I have 3 kids and they all loved it! We placed it in between the two front seats of the van. The only complaint they had was when we were on the expressway, the volume at its loudest could barely be heard by my kids sitting all the way in the back of the van. I agree with the first review, this would be wonderful for 1 or 2 people with either the screen on the seat directly in front of them or with the player on their lap."
1,Keep Looking,I purchased this item in March of 05. I used it five times on long trips for maybe an hour at a time. This week the screen completley went out. It no longer works at all. Toys R Us would not return it after it 90 days and neither would the manufacturer. I would highly recommend buying another brand.
1,Not worth it!,I just bought the unit on Black Friday sale. I came home and plugged it in and there is no volume control on the unit and very cheap looking. I am afraid it will break very easily. Only one headphone jack. Don't Buy it. Spend a little more money and buy something worhwhile
1,A PIECE OF CRAP,"I bought this at Toys R Us. After about six hours of use, it went DEAD. I tried everything to get it back running--switching from the ac adaptor to the car adaptor, and finally to a fully charged battery. No luck.This is a piece of crap and Toys R Us ought to know better than to sell an item that clearly is junk. I'm now out (...and Toys R Us refuses to return my money."
1,Have to return,"Unfortunately, I bought this for my son to have as a Christmas gift. It doesn't work; it will only power up but not play any DVDs. I'm heading to TRU to return it tomorrow"
3,"Good game, somewhat lacking","This game is fun but has some shortfalls. The combat is great and the ship controls are easy to learn but powerful when mastered. The story is okay. You can only pilot one man fighters and small cargo ships. This would be okay if ship performance was different among the options, but it is not. All the ships perform the same (acceleration, turning, top speed, etc). So the best bet is to just take the largest cargo vessel you can afford as they tend to have better armor and shields. Fun multiplayer! My friends and I love to set up ambushes for diamond shipments and loot the debris for quick cash!"
4,Freelancer review useing Windows 7 Ultra 32 Bit.,"Following instructions it installed and runs,able to play on my Windows 7 Ultra 32 Bit system.My Computers Compatibility recomended to run the game in Windows XP service pack 2 mode.I also sign on to the game useing the Administrators mode. Im runing the game in Windows XP service pack 2 mode and signing on tothe game as Administrator.Windows 7 Ultra has that feature. I still notice some screen interferance while in the game at times when reading info from screen menu but its just a minor glitch able to work around it and still play the game good enough,actual game play is clear and good enough.I may install the game in my XP Mode/Virtual to see if it runs better witout the screen interferance.The quality of the game is good,the story line is interesting.I like it,and think it is worth the money."
5,Freelancer Pc,Awesome Game ! Works with most Windows Operating Systems with no issues or bugs.Controls work great using keyboard and mouse. The game is easy to learn and play.Graphics are good for when it was made and are better then some newer games I've played.Would buy is you like first person based space action games.
4,Great Game,"When I was a kid one of my favorite games was Wing Commander: Privateer. It was the best of the Wing Commander series and I played it several times over until it no longer worked on whatever computer I owned, but I haven't been able to find a game since to replace it. Until now.Freelancer it a great space adventure game without all the muck of being a flight simulator, which I am not very fond of. The only reason I didn't give the game five stars is because it has some long cut scenes of you attacking bases on foot, but doesn't actually let you go into FPS mode to fight the bad guys yourself.That aside, I love this game."
4,Good Game For $10,It's a good game for $10. but I would have been disappointed if I had to pay the original price.
2,Great... til it died!,"My Canon Powershot A40 was also the most user friendly piece of technology I'd ever used until it died. Same deal as everyone else I guess. The thing will turn on but something inside no longer opens as the screen remains blank. Don't bother upgrading as all Canon cameras are pretty much similar. My sister-in-law's A75, which is 6 months old, just died of the same cause."
5,Great Camera for begining digital photogrophers,"I got the Canon Powershot A40 in December of 2002 after researching these things for months. I chose on the A40 for its resonable price and capabilites. It has 6 differnt modes on its wheel but you go can go farther. You can take photos in B/W, Vivd, Nuetral,Low sharpining, and Sepia. Its movie mode is advertised to make a thirty second movie, but I have found it only takes about a 20 second movie. so now lets go to the pros and cons.PRO's:1)Price2)Zoom capibilitys3)Usability4)Large LCD screen5)Easy removal of unwanted pictures6)Battery life7)Software8)SetupCON's:1)Shutter lag2)Weight (See 2)2(If you want a lighter camera look at its brother the A60)Overal this is a great camera and I would highly suggest getting it."
4,"Great, Affordable Camera","Though 3 and 4 megapixel cameras are becoming more popular, this affordable 2 megapixel camera is worthwhile for people on a budget. It easily pays for itself in film and processing costs. It is best for smaller pictures. I print 5x7's and they come out wonderfully. It's the only camera I use! I recommend buying rechargable batteries and a larger CompactFlash card to get the best from this camera."
4,Fantastic picture quality,"Great for all basic shooting, travels, etc. Better picture quality than smaller cameras."
4,The camera of the cameras,"Don`t think twice, remeber Canon is Canon, and you'll get more than expect. Also, digital camera is not the only point, think about the software to handle your pictures...canon has it! excelent!"
2,Great till it died,"I was happy with this camera, till one day I turned it on and recieved the dreaded ""E24"" error message. This message appears and then the camera shuts off. The only solution is to send it to Canon and pay about as much to repair it as a replacement 2 mp camera would cost. My 2 month old Canon printer just died too, so I am reconsidering my loyalty to Canon products. Both products were barely used before they quit working. I don't normally recommend extended warranties, but it might be a good idea with this product, or better yet avoid it all together."
5,highly recommended point & shoot!,"this is my first digital camera & i truly love it. it's easy to use & takes terrific photos (in the high resolution mode). the mini movie making function is a fun bonus,too."
3,Great... yet not great.,"We received the camera right in time for my sister's wedding. Mother asked me to look at it and figure it out, which I was more than pleased to do. It was an excellent camera, and I was impressed with all of the features provided. Clarity was exceptional, ease-of use phenomenal, and it was a comfortable camera to use. Was is the key word. Less than a half an hour into testing it, something happened. The view suddenly became extremely blurry and quite ugly. I worked it over for another hour and a half, trying to figure out what happened. None of the manuals would help, and I couldn't find anything online. We had to send it back and use a disposable for my sister's wedding. We ordered another digital camera, but we've found that we don't like it as much and are currently trying to find another Powershot A40...."
2,"Mostly okay, but one major disappointment...","No complaints about picture quality, ease of use, or software. But one big disappointment...When I saw this camera had a built-in microphone I naturally assumed it was for voice annotation of pictures. It's not. Despite having a built-in mike and even having an icon on the display to represent a picture with an audio attachment, you cannot do voice annotation. The microphone is only for ""movies"" - low-resolution, 10-second, video clips. Something I don't think I will ever use."
2,Passing grade...,"Pro: Right size and weight; Easy to use; good photo quality generallyCon: Optical viewfinder inconsistent with actual picture (1) it's considerably smaller (~80%) (2) they're not ajusted to the same center, this really bothers me (I checked with my friend's A40, same thing); Bad indoor/night pictures. Lately after one year of use, indoor pictures are always very hazy I haven't figures out why."
4,Great and easy to use,"The A40 is an excellent point and shoot digital camera for the casual shot. BUT it has manual control that allows you to take shots that an automatic camera could never capture properly; like tough night shots. It also has a panaramic feature that lets you stitch multiple photos into one (it really works, and it's easy to do). The best feature I like is that it can use regular batteries in a pinch; however, the rechargable batteries last a long time (I recommend a good fast charger). And that's not all, it also has a 3X optical zoom (forget those digital zooms); AND it has an adapter lens cover to add a telephoto lens (optional). Even though this camera has only 2MP it captures great photos. For the price, it can;t be beat!!"
5,"Exellent Camera, Exellent Pictures.","This Camara is great. The wife and I finnaly got tired of our [junk] 35 millimeter camera... so we forked out the money for this model, a 128MB memory card, and some rechargable batteries.We couldn't be more happy. The picture quality is exellent. About once a month we select the pictures we really like and take them to a store that will develop them onto photo paper for a fair price (much cheaper for us than buying a lot of fancy printers and such). The results are far better quality than those from our 35 millimeter camera. The color in the pictures is just great.I had no idea digital pictures could be transfered to photo paper with such exellent results. Toss your old film using camera in the garbage and get yourself one of these babies."
5,Incredible camera!,"What a lot of camera for the money! Unbelievably clear pictures, awesome features, great flash, uses AA batteries which is especially great in a pinch (go ahead and buy rechargables and save!) really fun to use movie mode (with sound!) and cables to see movies and photos on TV! This is actually my second - a friend recently dropped and broke the first one. I shopped around and looked at all the ones in this price range and higher and just couldn't see buying another brand/type since I've been so pleased with this little camera....especially since it's now $50-$100 cheaper now than when I bought the original about 10 months ago!"
5,Best Camera For The Money,"If you research reviews on non-merchant sites, you'll come to the same conclusion. Since all the other reviews pretty sum it up, I'll just add that ideally you should purchase a larger CompactFlash Card (128MB is the best value right now) and 2 sets of at least 1800mAh NiMH rechargable batteries."
4,Canon A40 - lots of features - fair price,"After purchasing the Canon A40 4 weeks ago - I have found no major feature flaws or problems. This is a great camera. It has more manual features than I will ever use - but they are there if needed. It has manual control of exposure and ISO settings - but also has the convenience of automatic point-and-shoot AUTO mode. The program mode lets you add special effects like black and white, sepia, vivid color, neutral, and more. The stitch assist lets you create panoramic pictures with ease.I bought Maha batteries and charger and have had no problems with power consumption.At worst, the LCD is a little dark when lighting conditions are poor. But when the flash hits - the pictures look great. Very few hot spots and great colors.A great camera with great features."
3,American viewers are left out.,"This DVD is good, but only has four shorts on it. The Aardman Classics DVD (region 2 only) has these four shorts plus around 22 more! So that one has other shorts like ""Next"" and ""War Story"" which have not been released on DVD in the U.S. (yet). I don't know why they didn't release that here instead of just a fraction of it. Anyway, you should check out this DVD, especially if you like claymation."
4,Very funny and entertaining for kids and adults,The claymation in creature comforts is very cute. The voices and personalities of the creatures are very funny and quite memorable. A wonderful fun video for kids and adults who like animations.
1,Not what you think it will be like,"I was so excited when we bought this DVD, after all I love Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run. But this hits rock bottom. If I could get my money back, I would. The cover of the DVD looks impressive, but that is the only thing that is. My five year old kept asking me,""Is this funny?"". The answer is no. The only one I even slightly liked is Adam. I did laugh a little. I was highly disappointed. Save your money. Buy Wallace and Gromit instead."
1,poor quality DVD,"While I regret having to give this such a low rating, I do it not because of the quality of the shorts themselves, but because of the quality of the DVD. The short movies are superb, and I recommend that you buy them on video. I ordered the DVD, and was appalled to find that it was of exceptionally poor quality. It did not run smoothly, was not sharp, and there were chunks missing from the picture. It is not my DVD player (it works fine for other DVDs), it was this DVD. Please save yourself a lot of trouble, and order the VHS instead."
2,5 Minutes worth it?,I have Creature Comforts on VHS and was considering getting it on DVD. That is until I saw the price. $35.99 for a half hour of animated shorts? This seems a bit extreme to me. I see that it's out of print so that might have something to do with it. The best skit on there by far is the Creature Comforts and it's only 5 minutes long. Hardly worth it if you ask me. Hopefully the original Creature Comforts skit makes its way to one of the Creature Comforts series DVDs as an extra.
2,NOT FOR KIDS,This is definitely an adult claymation. It has full blown nudity and deals with adult themes such as death and going to hell. It is also violent. I bought it in the children's section for my four year old and promptly got rid of it. Some adults did find it humerous though.
3,"Wrong picture aspect ratio, should be FULL FRAME","The Creature Comforts short is presented in the wrong aspect ratio. It was filmed in FULL FRAME and intended to be seen that way. When compared to the old full frame VHS tape & Laserdisc you will see jokes that are cut off on this letterboxed DVD.The other shorts are presented in their correct aspect ratios, either full frame or letterboxed as they were produced."
5,Disagree with previous review!,"My 2 year old daughter loves this DVD. The nudity on the DVD is not gratuitous or offensive as it is ADAM from the bible. Yes she is a bit turned off by the Devil in ""Not Without My Handbag"" but it is not done in any type of overly scary way either.....He is a salesman at a washing machine company with a french accent. I do understand that some children are more spookable than others so keep that in mind, but overall it is a very good collection of shorts. I highly recommend for any fans of Chicken Run or Wallace and Gromit!"
3,Too short,"I got this mainly because it was 'Creature Comforts' that introduced me to Nick Park. No special features, not even English subtitles. As an American, I had a little difficulty understanding the British accents. Multiple viewing helps. Overall the DVD runs about 30 minutes. The 6 minute 'Creature Comforts' is the best of the four. Even at a low price this DVD is pushing the value envelope. It's not worth it unless you absolutely love Nick Park animation and have to have it in your collection."
4,Inventive and dazzlingly surreal...,"Nick Park opens this collection of four British clay animated comedy shorts with ""Creature Comforts"", a hilarious and occasionally poignant tale of an interview with various animals in a zoo. This one is the most authentic. ""Not Without My Handbag"" can be questionable (and scary) for younger viewers, but for adults it is a humorous and knowing tale with a finely rooted moral at the climax. ""Wat's Pig"" and ""Adam"" are a little grown up for even sophisticated Brits, but they are equally clever and original. Well worth watching...once. Rated PG for nudity and some vulgarity."
3,One out of four ain't bad,"If you can get it cheaply, it's worth buying this DVD just for the short ""Creature Comforts."" The rest of the stuff on here -- ""Wat's Pig,"" ""Not Without My Handbag"" and ""Adam"" -- was done by people other than Nick Park, and just isn't all that interesting.It's too bad they didn't put out a ""Best of Nick Park"" DVD, with all of the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts, ""Creature Comforts,"" and maybe some of Nick's better commercials. Oh well!"
5,"Zoo gets 5, the rest bring it down a notch!","I first saw Creature Comforts as a fill in on PBS. Many years have passed and I still recall the polar kid asking if it was ok to eat the interviewer.The juxtaposition of the creatures of our Earth having such a clear image of human (and arn't they) lives is beautiful.Seemingly trapped to the day and yet somewhat content in their memory of what has, might have, or may be.Lovely! Thanks, Nick."
