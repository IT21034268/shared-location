3,High Level and Lots of it.,"Perfect book if you need high level information. It covers just about all the topics. I learn well from books like this, except that there are places were I whish there was more delail. I use it as a reference book. Why the 3 starts then? Buying the book I expected to gain learn tricks and clever ways to do things but that wasn't the case... The book serves as a reference."
3,Programmer,"I have had this book for about 6 months and while I do find that it is a very good reference book, I definately agree it lacks depth. Most applications that I deal with are database applications and to only dedicate two small chapters to databases while dedicating hundreds of pages to simple objects like forms and text boxes is kindof useless for me.If you are trying to learn VB and want a good reference book, this is the book for you. However, if you are an experienced VB Programmer who is looking for a book to cover in depth advanced topics, then consider another book. I would recommend most of the titles by WROX for that purpose."
4,A valuable resource guide for VB6,"The Black Book is an excellent resource guide for VB6 programming. Note that this is not the type of material you would simply sit down and read. The author has tried to cram as much material as possible into ""just-the-facts-and-a-quick-demo"" style chunks. This means that you generally need to know what it is you are looking for in the first place. What makes it so great is that you can find an example and an explanation of most any type of control or process that you need, quickly and clearly. The author has even gone a step further, demonstrating such things as image manipulation and ActiveX development. ActiveX documents and DHTML are also covered. This book is not for beginners, but intermediate to advanced users will enjoy it's brevity and depth."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Particularly after reading many of the rave reviews here, I have been somewhat disappointed with the Black Book.I was surprised, for example, to see virtually no coverage or explanation of the printer object. Also, in the section on File Handling, the requirement for the FreeFile function is covered as kind of an afterthought (as a tip).The above are merely examples. Clearly the book provides lots of helpful information; but in my view, some material is given disappointedly short shrift. For $50, I was expecting more.Although it's quite a bit more a beginner's book and doesn't provide nearly the breadth of the Black Book, I found ""Paul Sheriff Teaches Visual Basic"" to be well done and a far better value at $20.A similar book, and somewhat more comprehensive, is ""VB6 From the Ground Up"" -- probably the best beginner's book I've seen."
2,Doesn't cover topics thoroughly enough to be useful,"This book covers it all- a wide range of topics indeed. Unfortunately this ""Indispensable Problem Solver""'s coverage is never in-depth enough to actually solve any problems! In almost all cases, I'm able to get more specific and detailed info from the online help included with VB."
2,Emm.. A bit poor,"In all fairness to the author this is a good book if you are new to the development scene. The publishers and the author do fail some of us by suggesting that this book is VB 6 orientated. Its not! What you do have is a general VB reference manual that is very simplistic and does not tackle any issue in depth. Unfortunately if you are looking for OLEDB, COM/DCOM or SQL Server interfacing using ADO/RDO then look elsewhere - these issues are not covered. Not for the pro's amongst us!"
3,it is a good visual basic 5 to 6 book,i dont find nothing form the data environment and other vb6 feature
5,A great book for reference and a quick problem solver,"I found this book really really helpful while coding or planning an approach. It is not a text book which will teach you chapters one by one, instead it directly attacks at the problem and makes life easier during the development life cycle. I highly recommend this book for people who are involved in designing or developing of an VB application as reference."
3,Not what it says it is...,"This book covers many areas of VB development and is okay as a quick reference. But....like most technical books it has a terrible index. It also has no depth to it...I realize it is designed as a quick look-up text but even so a bit more background on things like DAO,ADO would have been helpful."
5,Excellent handy book to have!,Excellent handy book to have next to your computer! A must have for a serious programmer.
4,lots of laughs lots of action,"This movie is loaded with supurb one liners. It cracks me up the whole way through.The movie is about an American, self rightious, wize cracking cop played by Roddy Piper (best known for his wrestling carreer and his role in ""They Live"") teamed up with a disciplined Asian martial arts cop played by Han Soo Ong (best know as the big bad guy ""Demon"" in ""Bloodsport II"") together they look for crime, survive nature and bicker till the credits roll. Most of the fight scenes are superior to the norm of B movies and some star genuine Grand Maters of lost arts (the Chinese guy in the ugly shirt whose private area is sqeezed by Piper). The laugh value is worth the cover price. The action is somtimes lacking but delivers enough of the good stuff to satisfy the martial arts fan in you."
2,Last to Surrender,"A nice action movie that lives from the interaction between the main characters. Ong Soo Han delivers a very good 'silent partner' part, and Roddy Piper is the loud and somewhat annoying 'hero'. The plot is somewhat thin and predictable, but it has a few nice and amusing scenes when the two cultures meet."
3,TYPICAL BUDDY/COP MOVIE,"AN AMERICAN NARCOTICS COP [FORMER WWE/WCW WRESTLER RODDY PIPER] MUST WORK WITH A CHINESE COP [HAN SOO ONG] TO TRACK DOWN A RUTHLESS KILLER. THIS TYPICAL BUDDY/COP MOVIE IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD. HAS SOME GOOD ACTION AND SOME FUNNY MOMENTS AS WELL. BUT, THIS MOVIE COULD'VE USED SOME MORE MARTIAL ARTS SCENES BEING THAT THERE IS A FEW MARTIAL ARTISTS IN THIS MOVIE. ANYWAY, IT'S AN OK MOVIE. THE BEST THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I ONLY HAD TO PAY $5.00 FOR THIS DVD!"
3,Decent for the non-internet/computer savy planner,This book is okay if you're a planner that isn't very computer literate/savy. If you like 'old school' planning it's fine. But if you're a product of new era planning you'll probably find this book a bit dated. Because of the year of publication it lacks many internet/computer recommendations. Some good ideas and a lot of beginner planner ideas as well.
3,Good book for first time planners,"This book was an easy read, with lots of info and ideas that would be good for first time reunion planners. However, more experienced reunion planners will find that they already know most of this info. If your library has this book, I would suggest checking it out there."
4,Mind blower!,This lady just blows my my mind away with her other book beginnings. This book does the same.The math in this book is all most unbelievable.
5,One of the best Melvins records,"This is one of my favorite Melvins records. I played the living stuff of it.Admittedly though, I didn't like it when I first picked it up. Several of the arrangments are weird and often times ends abruptly. After awhile though, I got used to it and the record grew on me.If you want something that rocks out but at the same time challenges your usual rock-n-roll conventions, this is the album for you. Give it a listen a few times. Thats all it takes...."
1,This album is terrific. I would require everyone to buy it.,The Melvins are great and this album is even better. None of the psuedo-artistic gobbledegook. Just hardcore heavy grunge at its best.
5,Spoken like a dreamer...,"Yes! These are the two albums that put Melvins on the global map. Uncompromising heaviness combined with mathematical autism, and embellished with Sir Buzz's poetry of sublime absurdity. This is not metal or punk. For those of you who know the language, this is more along the lines of Blast! or perhaps some of the better later-Black Flag - but far darker, and much, much slower. Gluey Porch Treatments is a black motor of an album (Victor Hayden where are you?), while Ozma a bit more straight ahead. While these albums are some of the most unflinchingly confrontational collections in the rock canon, make no mistake: these are important, landmark albums. Remeber: no Melvins = no Nirvana."
5,GLUEY+PORCH+TREATMENTS=SPINE CRUSHING,"Tracks 1-17 are Ozma, and 18 on are GPT. GPT is slower, scarier, and just plain better than Ozma, though both are outstanding. GPT is like a terrifying monster, while Ozma is its bride. Still, both are scary, and well worth the listen. This will eat Nirvana and Pearl Jam fans for breakfast! Yeah!!!!"
2,Not what I expected,These chairs have a very big visible screw and washer holding the arm to the back. This is not shown in the photo. There should be a wood plug covering the screw head. The hardware shown in the diagram was not the hardware enclosed and the screw that holds the seat to the back would come right through the back wood if screwed in all the way. Does not look like the picture!!!!
4,Men's size 9.5/10 ~ Large - fits well sturdy,"I bought these to compliment my snorkeling (I was going without fins before) since I knew I was going to Hanauma Bay in Hawaii and I wanted to make sure to always stay about the coral. You don't want to get tired and step on the coral in a protected nature reserve!Depending on the type of shoe, I typically wear a men's 10 and my feet aren't too wide. The large size fit perfectly and stayed on without any fear of slipping off.I used them for hours over multiple days and they're in great shape even after practically folding them in half while walking out of the water to the beach. They clean very easily and show no signs of wear - I look forward them to using them for awhile!"
5,Check for size,"I initially bought these trying to think about general sizes. I got the wrong size. Check for the size comparison chart at [...]Once I got the right size, the paint came off of ONE of the flippers. This doesn't matter to me, but I thought I'd mention it - one of my yellow flippers are a mix of yellow and orange.As far as performance goes - I've seen some flippers get really lax in the heel, but these seem to stand up pretty well to use and abuse by the rays of the sun.Great product."
1,Chepo fins,I have a pair of floating speedo fins that I had for years. I used these fins for a cumulative total of 30 days before they ripped. These fins are cheap - don't waste your money like I did mine.
5,Great fins!,"My 11 year old son has been using these fins 3-5 days a week for about 6 months, and they still look practically brand new. No rips/tears or otherwise. At the time of ordering he was wearing a 6.5-7 mens (he's a solid size 7 now), so we sized up to the 7-8 (Medium) to make sure he had a little room to grow in them. He says they still fit great, and they are comfortable - no sore spots or anything. I would imagine they'll fit through his next growth spurt and then we'll have to move up again after that.The trick is to NOT let him play around in the pool with his fins - they are only for swim practice! Then they appear to last quite a while."
3,Size Chart!!!,RUBBER SWIM FINS Style #7530039 XXXS XXS XS S M L XL XXLShoe Size Equivalents 11-13 kids 1-3 kids 3-4 5-6 7-8 8-9 10-11 12-13
2,Uncomfortable,I bought these after reading the good reviews but it has a ridge where the end of my toes hit and it cuts into my skin. I returned them and bought some from a swim store which were double the price but much better.
1,Got 2 pairs. Both broken in 6 months,Not durable. Look elsewhere. I still remember the day when fins would last years! 6 month is just unacceptable. I'm shopping for new pairs and will try to stay away from Speedo.
4,Little Bit Loose,"The fins felt a little bit loose, especially when you are doing the butterfly kick. It feels like the middle section is bending inward on your foot. Good product overall. I would try to order true to size."
1,Too big,I ordered XXL fins and they were way too big. I wear a 13-14 shoe size. They were way too wide for my feet. The fins are so big that I could barely move them in the water.
2,Comfortable but a short life!,"I have gone through two pairs of these fins in the past year. The rubber is very soft and comfortable, but the fins do not hold up well. I swim laps and kick (1,000 yards) three times a week, and the fins have split at the toe.That said I am likely to buy another pair."
2,Tore down the back.,"They worked awesome for the first 2 times I used them. Then, about midway through my second outing with them, they tore down the back while I was trying to put them back on. If you get them, be very careful when you are putting them on and taking them off. They will rip fairly easily."
2,Size chart needed,"The fins are all right, very flexible, but a size chart is needed. I was misled by other reviews and bought a size too big. It says right on the fins: Size 10-ll, XL (Extra Large) but unfortunately this relation is not revealed on the web site, so we have to guess. Apparently a ""Large"" would have been the size 9.5 I needed."
4,Speedo Rubber Swim Fins,"I have ordered these swim fins before; but for some reason these are a little different. The size runs big. Everything else is excellent. They are all rubber. They are the soft, durable rubber. They feel good in the water. You really get a work out and they help you to speed through the water. I have had them since June and its now September; they still look brand new. I use them Mon-Friday to work out. They are really a great buy. I would definitely recommend them."
3,Disapointment,"There is no size chart on the web site, so I chose to use the size chart I found in the reviews- big mistake. There was a size chart attached to the actual flippers, and it goes as this:xxxs 11-13Y (child) Redxxs 1-3 Orangexs 3-4 Yellows 5-6 GreenM 7-8 BlueL 8-9 GreyXL 10-11 BlackXXL 12-13 NavyHope this helps people buying this product in the future!Also- I have not used the fins- they will be returned. This is just a rating on the service, which wasting my time."
4,"Bright Pop, With a Twist","At first, No More Kings might sound like just another bright, upbeat rock album--pleasant, but mostly harmless. It's only when you realize that the songs are about zombies, a character from The Karate Kid, and Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput that the pieces fall into place. Great fun!"
4,Good flick for lovers of the horror genra,"I have to say right off the top that 'horror' is not my favorite genre, but I ordered this through the Vine program to take a look. I have of course viewed other horror-type films, so I had a bit of comparison ammunition.For real connoisseurs of movies of this kind, I have to say, they will probably really enjoy this one. Better written than most, very nicely filmed, gore for sure, but in the correct situation, an attractive 'stalker', and a very bright victim-to-be 'P2"" is in the same caliber of film as the original 'Halloween' series episodes when it comes to quality. And, it has all the prequests of a natural fear-related setting to stike the cord of the familiar just enough to seem altogether believable in today's society.I enjoyed it and I think real lovers of the horror scene will enjoy it even more. So order up - online of course - to prevent having to park in a massive, maze-containing, dark, spooky, parking structure while you shop."
4,P2 - classic psycho thriller,"P2 isn't your typical slasher, gore fest. Rather, it is a psychological thriller, which takes place in the parking garage on Christmas eve. Wes Bentley does a brilliant job as Thomas, the psycho parking security guard, who kidnaps the main actress (Rachel Nichols). Like any good thriller, Bentley's psycho is funny, interesting, and of course totally nuts.This is one of the films that you can't take seriously. Just have fun, relax and watch."
4,I was surprised - better than expected,"Sorry but I dont agree with the poster above (Mark)I enjoyed this very much and I would definitely call it a thriller. At first I didnt expect much of it, but I was surprised how good it actually was.One of those movies that keeps your attention.If you like your thrillers I can recommend this."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Movies derived from naturally creepy places and situations should be the scariest movies of all-time. Unfortunately, most of the time they are way too predictable to even be entertaining and that was the case with P2. A woman gets trapped in her office parking garage, on a holiday weekend, and is being stalked. Sounds interesting, but it wasn't. This film has got to be one of the slowest moving ""thrillers"" I've ever seen. The acting was actually pretty good in this film, but everything that happens, you know it's coming sooner or later and there are no surprises what so ever. Like I said the acting was pretty good, so it's not a total piece of s***, but it's slow, predictable, and just a really weak story. I usually love the ""it could happen"" type of films, but if P2 really did happen, no one would be surprised or really care all that much."
4,Heinously underrated,"One of the most underrated horror/thriller films out there! Rachel Nichols does excellent work as an everywoman having to take on a psychopath. Fine directing, good cinematography and a break neck pace is sure to satisfy fans of the genre. Plus I appreciated the fact that characters rarely made stupid decisions and instead just kept trying outsmart and or outmuscle the other. Don't listen to the critics, this is a good one. (Roger Ebert even gave it 3/4 stars)"
4,Review for P2 Movie,"If I could rate this a 3.5 instead, I would. You won't see anything overly unique or original in this movie, but it IS actually a pretty well made film. The antagonist does his job quite well, and despite the.... obnoxiously over-endowed female lead, she too does a pretty fine performance. There are some decently 'disturbing'-ish moments and alright tension. To say the least, I had added this to my queue one night on a B-movie spree, but was pleasantly surprised with this one."
3,Simple Yet Effective Horror Film,"Well you might think twice about being in a parking lot garage again, woman gets kidnapped by psycho who is obssessed with her. Watches her every move on security cameras, kills one of her co-workers who didn't take no for answer with an encounter she had with him caught on tape, she escapes and he won't let her leave. some intense moments and good acting, some scary situations. Decent for a low budget film, kept me entertained."
4,P2,I would have given this movie 5 stars but the reason why I did not was because it is the same kind of movie that I have seen in the past a dozen times. (The story line is the same as a lot of others) Don't get me wrong the movie was a good one and the actors and actresses did a great job but the story could have used something different in it to make it stand out from the films in the past that are like it.VLH
2,"BY THE NUMBERS PSYCHO ON THE LOOSE, BUT............","'P2' adds nothing new to the genre, but it is somehow watch-able. I found myself knowing what was around every corner, but it didn't keep me from peeking anyway. I did enjoy the parking lot setting and I'm sure we have all been a bit nervous walking through one at one time or another. There is also one gruesome and gory death, so if your squeamish you may want to pass this up or close your eyes, like my wife did. I have seen much worse, but this is really pretty standard stuff. I caught this on cable, so I know nothing about the DVD quality or extras."
3,Enough with portraying Rottweilers as vicious monsters.,"I enjoyed this highly suspenseful thriller with its cat and mouse tension. An underground parking garage was a great setting, because they are naturally creepy! Towards the end I actually found myself biting my nails! Excellent acting, the two main characters have to carry the whole film and they do a superb job of it.My one beef with this film is the killing of the Rottweiler. The movie was strong enough without this sick extra. This is one of my favorite breeds, and I am sick to death of seeing them portrayed as vicious killers. So, I deducted a star for that reason. But, that's my personal opinion."
4,"shockingly, this is quite good.","a simple and strong story. these are smart charecters with capable actors in their roles. the suspense is there, the gore is there, and this is an overall well done horror film. its a genuinely refreshing cat and mouse thriller."
4,M2 (Me Too),"M2, I would probably would have done the same thing as the security guard, the girl is so beautiful, of course, would not take it to the extreme, this is a masterpiece thriller worth watching more than once!"
4,"P2, a Holiday Horror Movie","Before getting P2, I never heard of it. Never even understood how a movie could be named ""P2."" But after watching P2 I must admit the movie is good! The backdrop is the Christmas/Holiday season (one which I love in movies). And the premise is that which we all feel at one time or another in life, that being us walking to our car at night, alone, and then automobile problems. And then we all know how everything closes up by 5PM Christmas Eve for the holidays (everyone is home with friends and family).So tie all of this in together (a single female walking to her car, alone in an empty garage on Christmas Eve, car problems) then add in a creepy psychopath and you have the makings for a good horror film!I truly enjoyed this movie. The realistic atmosphere, which I can easily see happening, along with much of what happens made it an all around good movie!I took one star off as I think the if the title was different (something catchy) the movie would of been a better seller."
3,Stupid girl vs Crazy guy,"P2 was entertaining enough as a stalker film, though it struggled with a lot of unnecessary filler. It's always good to see Wes Bentley, who's been somewhat typecast. Good thing Angela was too stupid to simply pull a fire alarm, otherwise there wouldn't have been a movie at all..."
2,sadistic and predictable in roughly equal measure,"Forget Halloween. For makers of slasher-movies, the holiday of choice would appear to be Christmas, with its glittery decorations and overall atmosphere of jollity and good cheer providing an unsettlingly incongruous backdrop for all the death, bloodletting and mayhem that are standard-issue elements of the genre.In `P2,"" a beautiful, young corporate executive is held hostage on Christmas Eve by a deranged killer posing as a security guard in the building where she works (P2 is the parking lot level on which she is kidnapped and held).This theme of a helpless ingénue being held against her will by a homicidal maniac is as old as the hills, and `P2' brings nothing of note to the scenario. It's all stock situations and unbridled sadism with very little in the way of actual drama or suspense.Check out 1965's ""The Collector,"" William Wyler's fine rendition on the theme, instead."
3,"Predictable plot, over the top grossness","P2 is a completely run of the mill psychopath stalks hottie flick. What makes it a little different is that it managed to gross even me out. I am a completely non-squeamish war veteran and it takes a lot to make me feel uncomfortable. P2 managed to reach and cross my threshold with gratuitous, graphic violence.The movie is set in a single location (a parking garage) and really only has two characters, Amanda and Tom. If you enjoy watching the tables get turned, or the concept of revenge then P2 is probably a good flick to watch. I had a hard time with the whole premise of the movie (that someone as mentally unstable as our main villain would act the way this guy does). The entire plot feels a little contrived but if you're a fan of horror you'll probably enjoy P2."
2,Not thrilling in the least,"I see almost every horror film whether the reviews are good or bad, so I couldn't wait to catch P2 on DVD. I think it was only in theaters around my area for two weeks.First the postive. I did like the Christmas and parking lot setting of the movie, but that is where my praise ends. The main problem I had was with the villian. Wes Bentley wasn't scary in the least and often came across as a whiny little wimp. In no way did this guy ever creep me out. Say what you want about No Country for Old Men, but the crazed killer in that is what I constitute as scary. On the other hand, I thought Rachel Nichols was a little better in her role (or maybe it was just her impressive cleavage on display throughout). The movie also felt a lot longer than 90 minutes, with the chase scenes being drawn out to extreme lengths.I like cheesy horror films as much as the high calibur ones at times, but P2 was neither."
2,"Hot Chick, Not Much Else","I was excited about 'P2' beforehand knowing that Alexandre Aja(director of 'High Tension' and 'The Hills Have Eyes' remake)had written and produced it. I don't know what happened.Plot: hot lady with big, um, talent gets trapped in a parking deck with a psychopathic security guard on Christmas eve. Nothing amazingly original, but a decent enough setup. Unfortunately not much really happens. The film is basically one long cat and mouse game, but it really has no suspense or tension.'P2' isn't a bad film. Its just a boring one. My advice: go check out 'High Tension' instead."
1,Whatever Happened to Dr. Mabuse?,"German producer Artur Brauner's erratic ""Dr. Mabuse"" series finally gasps its last breath. Released in 1964, ""Death Ray Mirror"" has virtually nothing to do with the infamous criminal mastermind. Though listed in the credits, actor Wolfgang Preiss doesn't even appear in the film! What we get is a convoluted James Bond knockoff with horrible English dubbing. Unwatchable in any language."
1,Chessdon in review,"The best that can be said about this book is that it is a personal effort by someone who has strong opinions about chess. Unfortunately, there are too many places where the author's version differs from the historical accounts. There are also very few good games, a definite minus for a book about chess. All in all, it is one I would rather have skipped."
2,"I guess if you like Hunter Thompson like books, go for it","Tell me something, on page 16-17 we hear of Fischer giving 4 move Black-odds plus an f7 pawn to Norbert, who is a local master, in 20 minute games for at least $... bucks a game.All Norbert has to do is 1.e3 2.Qf3 3.Bc4 4.Qf7 mates!So you can infer from this anecdote how reliable Shultz is in other matters. Can anyone refute other stories? It would help to determine whether we put the book up for recycling, or for toxic waste disposal."
3,The Man in the Iron Mask - Richard Chamberlain,"This film is very loosely based on Alexander Duma's tale. If you've seen any other film version, the ending is about the same--none of the films use Duma's ending. The acting is adequate and Jenny Agutter is beautiful."
5,The Man In The Iron Mask,Been searching a long time for this movie. It came quickly to me after ordering and arrived in pristeen shape. I have vviewed the movie and it is great.My thanks to the seller.
1,Very poor adaptation,"I was very disappointed with this particular movie adaptation of the book. In the opening credits it states: Based on the book by Alexandre Dumas - Yeah VERY VERY LOOSLEY based! The Characters were completely changed around, and in some cases completely left out. The lowest rating available was 1 star; but I'd like to give it a -5 stars. I do NOT recomend this movie - although Richard Chamberlain did a good job playong the dual role, I have yet to find a good movie adaptation. The more recent verison with Leonardo DiCaprio was just as farcical- although more of the characters were there, the storyline was WAY OFF! All in all the book was by far the best. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on either movie version - buy the Book!"
3,Subtitles in Chinese,"I love this movie, all time classic. Only disaapointment was the DVD displays the subtitles..in chinese :| I was not able to remove subtitles from the MENU. I did BURN a copy and REMOVED all subtitles and it worked!:D"
3,The Man in the Iron Mask,"I love the story but this version was not made in the USA. The sound quality is poor and, of course, the subtitles are not in English. I would not recommend."
4,lab coats,"The lab coats that I received are of decent quality, they should wear well. Only issue that I had was that two of the six that I ordered were not as white as the others... kind of dingy in comparison to the other four. I am using these for student labs, so not a big deal. Definitely worth the money!!"
5,Best Robin Hood Ever!,"The BBC Roin Hood series, lasting - as I recall - 2 seasons, was a masterpiece of fantasy and medieval storytelling, From the nicely authentic gear and sets and look of the characters, to the fine action, to the plot and character development, to the cool sorcery and Pagan remnants, this show is the best. I wish more of it was on tape, but just treat yourself, and get any of it that you can, whether the first season with the dark-haired Robin, or the second with the blonde - and get 'Herne's Son' to see how that happens...Ian"
5,speedy service!,"i loved the river, and am really upset that abc will apparently not be continuing on to the next seasons =[ so i decided to order the dvd!! i was so excited to get it and then it shows up 2 days later, score!"
5,i luv the river,I love the river because it is not like those girl shows it's drama and horror and a perfect combitnation of the 2.
5,Just up my alley,I loved this and really hope they have a second season so I know what happens. It has spooky parts and great to watch it the dark.
2,boring,"Very formulatic storytelling with unimaginative characters. This was interesting for the first few episodes, but quickly became a bore. Skip it."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this DVD after reading all the reviews...after watching it I wish I'd saved my money! Very disappointing, not at all creepy and the characters, particularly Tess very irritating. Think twice before spending your hard earned money on this. If you want to watch a good series try the Danish The Killing 1&2, The Bridge and French tv series Braquo and Spiral, I promise you'll never see anything better!"
1,"Mediocre at best, blatant ripoffs and horrible plot at worst","I went into this with high hopes, but the pilot episode was a huge let down. The entire 'hanging dolls' scene in the forest was obviously a direct ripoff from 'Blair Witch', and too many of the 'shock' moments were due less to compelling suspense than to the usual clichés attributed to this genre.The absolute worst moment came in the season finale, with the shooting of one of the main characters. The plot of the show involves the fact that there are 3-5 cameras in every room on the ship, but apparently everybody on board seems to have forgotten that they could just check the tapes to see exactly who it was who did the shooting. Of course, that would have meant there was no 'mystery' to fill out the episode.I can't imagine this going to a second season (most of the first season seemed like 'filler' as it was); and if it does, I certainly won't be among it's viewers."
4,edge of your seat in spots,I really like it. I have watched every show. I don't really care if they find him or not but I do want to know what it is that is going after every one. It can be scary in spots. The part with the monkey was icky. Worth watching. I do hope it comes back.
1,You have got to be kidding me,"After the 1st experience with supernatural beings, 100% of people on this planet would say:""Thanks very much, I'm headed back to San Diego""The writers and producers must think I'm a complete idiot to believe that rational people would continue TIME AND AGAIN to keep venturing into pure nightmare.Come on, Hollywood. It's not like Lost, where you couldn't just leave."
4,Rosolino...a must!,"I purchase anything i can find by rosolino. Im a bebop fanatic and very particular. I've heard rosolino in person. He never disappointed; tho, nobodys ""on"", every nite. Three stars for frank would equal five stars for most others!"
3,"Sstarts off great, but loses steam.","Mary Lou Finch is not a woman to sit by and allow her future to be ruined. So when Pierce Thorndike's prize racehorse Damien's Curse mysteriously disappears before a major horse race, she takes it upon herself to solve the mystery to prevent her father from losing all the money he has wagered on the horse. Sparks fly immediately when Mary Lou applies for the position of governess for Pierce's young son, Edward. She finds him perplexing; he finds her unique Set in late nineteenth century New York, this story illustrates the life of society's elite as they pursue horse racing as a hobby and a venture. While the heroine's character is fleshed out through the course of the story, the hero remains an enigma to the heroine and the reader until close to the very end. The plot is well paced with the romance and the mystery nicely interwoven. The society event scenes read more like a gossip column than a novel. The story limps unsatisfactorily to the finish line."
2,The worst investment for nursing...,"I bought the pillow while my baby was still in the hospital thinking this was the best thing ever invented. I told a friend about it and she said it didn't work for her. I thought maybe because she was a bigger person and I'm half her size. When my baby came home I was so excited to use it, but what a disappointment. The pillow was too high, too hard even for my preemie. Unable to nurse I went back to my regular pillow...much better. The only hope for this pillow since I can't return it is to use it for my baby when he starts to sit up. NOT WORTH THE $40.00 DOLLARS!!"
2,Original much better.....,"I have the original Boppy and received this as a gift-decided to keep it. I really don't like the added fabric part that the original doesn't have(Original Boppy owners-you know what I mean). Every one uses their Boppy differently-I personally like to wrap it around my waist while I nurse and you can't do that with this one. It is very plush though, but not soft enough. It would need a lot of breaking in. This one is not for me-i'm stickin with the original."
2,not for me,"I received the Boppy Nursing Pillow as a gift, but found it just did not work for me. My son kept rolling toward one side or the other and the pillow kept scooting off my lap. The pockets are a nice feature, however. I exchanged it for the Boppy 5 in 1 gym, which is actually usefull, although I don't use it for nursing, either."
1,Forget the Boppy,"As a Rookie breastfeeding mom, I must say I HATED this boppy. My daughter and I just couldn't get the hang of using it -- she would always slide around, even with the panel in the middle -- and it would just end up frustrating both of us.I would recommend buying the My Brest Friend pillow instead -- it attaches to your body so there's no chance that they baby can slip through, and allows you to position her correctly the first time."
5,Pictorial research,"Although this book is a few years old it was an inspiration and had lots of good info in it. I found my wedding dress in it and made it from the picture. We also got the idea of a ""white bar,"" which no one in New Orleans had ever heard of nor would offer us. Very stylish, very chic, and while I also recommend Bridal Bargains and the Diane Warner books, this book you read after those two."
3,Poetry Basics,"I was disappionted with this book, maybe because I was expecting more of a how-to teach poetry and the author focuses on getting kids writing. I think I can use some of the ideas with my middle school students, but I would say this guide is best for younger kids. Also, the book is set up so the example poems are meant to be read to students, not to be reproduced. I'd like my students to see and read the poems for themselves."
2,Frustration,"I really hoped to find useful information in this book, meaning deep insights, as says the title - Imoye (wisdom). I considered myself to be a beginner and reading it I realized that maybe I am not a begginer at all. This is a book for people who is not seeking the deeper aspects of knowledge.I enjoyed the Introduction and Chapter 1 and had prepared myself for more.Frustration was my feeling as I kept reading it and realized how shallow it is. And after finishing the book, I could not understand what the author was aiming at, it made no sense, it was like each chapter had a series of information poorly related to other chapters.I felt it was not worth the purchase."
5,GOOD CLEAN FUN,MY SON HAS BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME OVER AND OVER. HE GETS BORED EASILY BUT THIS GAME HAS KEPT HIS ATTENTION. THANK YOU.
2,"buy ""Secret Life"" instead....","I bought ""Secret Life"" thought it was ok (4 Stars), so I decided to buy the EP also. Well Don't! It's the same songs but worse. Their version of ""cars"" is terrible. save your money just buy the new one."
1,Dumb,This is the worst CD that I've ever heard. I strongly suggest that you don't buy this CD and you go to listen to a real rap CD by Snoop Dogg.
3,read the following before you buy,"Being a fan of Danzig & Santanika, I bought this video hoping to see great Satanika animation. What I got was a two minute Satanika trailer for a movie that doesn't exist. Animation is great and the interviews with Danzig & the Japanese animators are ok, but there should be a warning to tell buyers that the Satanika animation is only two minutes long."
1,What a rip off!,"This shouldn't be Satanika the Pilot Video, this should be the 2-minute trailer to a non-existent video! The only reason I got this tape was because of Yoshiaki Kawajiri, thinking that the 25 minutes slapped on the credits was referring to the pilot video itself. Hmmm, so I thought it was a 25-minute OAV. WELL IT'S NOT! Disgusting! It's 2 1/2 minutes! True, the animation is good, but this should be priced $2.50! What a rip off! Wag nyo tong bilin plis! (Don't buy this please!)"
2,Disappointing,"As other reviewers have stated, there is a very brief animated preview (which, honestly, wasn't all that impressive). You will wait through much talking and build-up only to find that there isn't a ""video"" at all. At this point, I consider it a collectible item, and doubt I will ever dig out my vhs to watch it again. I was so excited to find this several years back, then very disappointed. Unless you are a serious collector, trust that there is absolutely no reason to buy this."
2,Average Book,"When I bought this book, I looked read it and looked at all the tricks and everything else, but it did not appeal to me as ""Wakeboarding... On the Edge"" did. Sure it's a good book, but I wanted much better. I do not reccomend this to wakeboarders that want to get better. Look somewhere else... sorry. :-("
3,Not bad for a children's book.,"Compared to the other juvenile literature on wakeboarding I have read at the library, this is probably the one of the more informative ones. For kids around 10 years of age, this may be a good introductory book. This book may be too basic for adults and they could probably get more information from somewhere else.(I also looked at Extreme Wakeboarding and Wakeboarding : Technqiues and Tricks). I also found Techniques and Tricks a good children's book, but I wouldn't recommend Extreme Wakeboarding for kids are who are trying learn how to wakeboard."
1,Not shocking-- not even interesting,"This book has no suspense and nothing new to add to the case since the guilty parties were put in prison. The ""shocking photos"" are highschool and wedding photos- the most shocking is a black and white image of part of a door that is spattered with blood.The author didnt string the events together very well or weave a web of suspense. It was like reading the newspaper clippings all over again without the journalistic skills.All in all a very disappointing read. Will be putting this in my next garage sale."
3,Tedious Writing by Amateur Author but Interesting Case,"The story of James Robertson who murdered his mother and father in cold blood out of pure greed is an interesting case to read; however, the style of writing was found to be a bit tedious. Readers are subjected to the long drawn out trial monologues that fail to produce any drama or theatrics of any sort.I would recommend this book only when there is nothing else on the shelf that seems interesting."
2,Pedestrian effort,"This effort would get a ""B"" in a high school journalism class. The reader will find that many questions come to mind but few are answered. The coverage of the trial testimony of the psychologists, psychiatrists, and social worker is virtually incomprehensible!"
1,Concur with the other reviewers.,"I concur with the other reviewers that this book shows very little research into the backgrounds of the protagonists or the reasons that this horrendous double homicide occurred.Best that can be said is that it was a quick read. On a scale of one to ten, say a four."
3,A mediocre book about a murder in the family...,"The book, Family Blood, by Lyn Riddle is the story of a troubled family. The mother and father are murdered by their 21 year-old son. I had a hard time staying interested in the book. No one connected to the case was interviewd. The book read like a term paper - just the facts. I thought I would like it because I am interested in murders which are committed within the family. The sons were heavily involved with prescription drugs and alcohol, the parents were angry at their sons and sought therapy, and everyone's lives were ruined. The story of this family was sad."
5,My favorite Seer yet,"After hearing about Sabine's hometown for so long, it was fun to finally see it for myself. Enjoyed meeting her old friends--and her old fencing club. Of course, there's some not-so-good history here, too, so Sabine's in for a bit of a tough ride as she tries to unravel the mystery behind a former classmate's death."
2,shallow,"This was so far my least favorite of The Seer series. I find the authors need to constantly remind us every little detail about every character annoying. We remember from the last book and if we don't then maybe we should read it again. Though as usual the author leaves me dying to find out what is next...""Daddy!"""
4,What Were You Thinking?,I am only 1/8 through this book and I WISH I had read this when I was 18. I am 52 and have been married to two sociopaths. A lot of the book verbalizes things many of us KNOW but we IGNORE. I recommend reading this to anyONE contemplating marriage. It's a wake up call. Makes you THINK. Some of us need someone to SAY things clearly in black and white. That would be ME. Well here it is... I plan on writing another review after completing reading this book. Stay tuned...
3,Promising theses but not much legal advice,"I wish the author really shared his legal expertise with the reader rather than beating around the bushes. The book could and should be much more succinct and to the point, while still easy to read/listened. Instead we get a lot of common sense notions, and many repetitions of the obvious, and not enough actual legalistic information.I've listened it in the digital format, and from more than 7 hours of audio, no more than 1 hour can be classified as legal advice. The rest is crowd-pleasing filling. Based on the subtitle $600 per hour legal advice, I defintely didn't got $4200 worth of legal advice."
5,Burt Reynolds and Barbara Loden Rules!!,"This is a great romantic movie in one of Burt Reynolds first starring roles about a Moab Utah rancher hired as a driver for a movie set being filmed there a becomes romantically involved with a film editor(Barbara Loden).IT has a wonderful musical score also,it's a must see!!!"
2,meh,"something about the cut of these shorts doesn't work well with this fabric.I like Code Four's prices, but i'd recommend sticking withCode Four Athletics 'Cascade' team soccer shortsor another of their mesh shorts."
3,TOO BIG!!!!,The quality was good but the size was huge. My 4 year old is swimming in these. They come below her knees. She wears a 5 so I was surprised that they were sooooo big.
3,Could be worse,"The pages printed per minute is great, but after filling the paper tray the first time (I don't think I got it too full) the printer makes noises if I put more than a half tray of paper in and they when it stops mid file for more paper it wastes a lot of paper printing out junk on each page when it restarts. Sometimes the first line of print on the paper isn't complete either.I don't know that I would buy another one, but it's hard to find a reasonably priced printer with this kind of output.It seems a shame to make what could be a good printer such a throw away."
2,Too weird for words,"I have only been able to sit through this film once. I picked it up because I saw that Gary Oldman was in it, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the characters or plot. Apparantly, there's an unhappily married woman (Theresa Russell) who keeps fantasizing that the son she gave up for adoption has come looking for her. He appears in the form of Oldman, but he acts like a bratty three year old, and the sequences involving him and Russell are just too odd to explain. And then there's her husband (Christopher Lloyd), who has this weird fascination with trains and masochism...but that's a different story. The ending makes no sense, but then, the whole movie makes no sense so I guess it doesn't matter."
2,I AM that mother!,"...says the truck driver to Oldman, in one of the most oddlyquotable lines, in a film built upon scene after scene offrustratingly strange action. Described as a black comedy, I don't remember laughing except in awe of its disregard for coherence . . . The climax scene is indescribable, and I'm not sure if it is weirder in or out of context. It is fitting that the title is a random snippit, explaining nothing and then being less than trivial even after seeing it. If you have an innate desire to see each starring male character's hindquarters, buy this film and enjoy it from the safety of your padded cell."
5,Mother : you left me but I never left you !,The initial lines of this famous Lennon `s composition will be the clever device to develop an intriguing story where the love of a homeless guy and a strange twist of fate will make of him (Gary Oldman ) establish a fascinating erotic affair with Theresa Russell one of of the supreme femme fatale of the eighties .As always Roeg surprises us with his challenging handle camera and shot angles .Terrific cast and a well elaborated script make of that bizarre story a very hard to watch movie .
3,Still not sure what happened...,"...in this odd and quirky comedy-drama. Is she his mother or not? Does he do something to her husband or does she just imagine it? Did he kiss his own mother in a sexual manner?You might not get the answers, but it is an interesting ride."
3,disappointed,just wasn't the same. It was old and didn't smell the same. I really liked California but won't be buying this again.
5,UNC Puzzle,"I bought this and two other ones to build for Christmas presents. It goes together pretty easily if you like to work puzzles. I had this framed and people that saw it thought it was a great picture, until they realized it was a puzzle! It framed great and people can't beleive it is a puzzle. Great gift idea."
5,Souvenirs from Europe,"This product remind me of my childhood in Switzerland and i love them, i was very happy to see that Amazon.com carried them and so i ordered them ! Good taste of chocolate not too sticky ! just good."
2,Toooo Sweet!,"I'm rather fond of international candies thanks to my time in high school with the foreign clubs. I'm also a lover of all things sugary and sweet. This, however, was a bit much for my stomach to handle. I think all those years of American processed sugar may have made my tastes a tad weak. I could only eat about one and a half solid before giving two to my dad (which he did not like. Said the same thing--too sweet) and melting the rest for a molding cast test. Where they were not my cup of tea, they might be just the thing for someone else. If you're in to super sugar sweet, they're just for you. If not, you might want to stay away."
1,The snore of the year.,"From the lame Vaughn-Oliver ripoff cover art right down to the Tom Petty middle of the road sound, Pistolero is a real disappointment. I've already sold my copy. The inspiration that was evident in his first three solo cd's has all but died. What's left is a boring rock effort with small glimmers of what could be--- checkout the intro to ""I Switched You"" and the intro to ""So.Bay."" The rest just didn't do it for me."
3,Frank's worst,"Far better than most muck out there, but for Frank this is not at all up to scratch. For each album except the Come on Pilgrim to Surfer Rosa transition Frank has come with something different. But this is the same as the first Catholics album except that the tunes aren't as catchy and it doesn't have the same lastability. Lastly Rich Gilbert should be ashamed of himself I could play better (that isn't a compliment). So Frank dump the Catholics and give us another well produced epic like TOY, its time for another change."
2,Maybe it's just me..,"It's so strange nowadays when I look at all these great reviews albums are getting by so many people but just can't find myself liking the music. It's so strange that musical gods always flicker really bright in their first few showings and then fade off into repetition and egotistical nonsense in latter ones. 'Cult of Ray' gave me some hope that this Pixie could still keep it together, but I think there was some magic having the great talent of Kim Deal running basslines and Joey whining his axe, pretending to be a rock guitar god. Now all of that's gone, and the magic's getting harder and harder to find."
2,Time to Retire,"Frank Black is gettting OLD! I never thought I would ever say I dont like a song by Frank Black, but my god man he is really going down hill."
4,Dancing To The New Bolero,"It took Frank Black almost a decade before he realized there's only so many songs you can write about space. That doesn't mean I know what he's going on about in ""Skelton Man"", but it is nice to see him moving in a different direction. Pistolero is astounding, easily his best album since The Pixies split. In fact, it's better probably than the last two Pixies albums, so what we're talking about is Frank's best album since 1989's Doolittle. The band is tight, the songs just swagger and Frank's voice is better than I ever remember it sounding. Does anyone else hear a touch of Van Morrison in his voice--Especially in ""Western Star""? And when he screeches ""I Think I'm Starting To Looooose It"", by god, you believe him. Absolutely inspired work."
4,"A good, solid CD.","Frank Black, to me, has shown remakable consistency in his solo career: all of his solo outings are good-to-excellent. ""Pisolero"" continues in the same vein that ""Frank Black and the Catholics"" started -- recording to two-track, they're just a four-piece band playing great, no-frills rockmusic. This one has a little more diversity than FBATC. It starts strong and finishes strong, which very few arists can do these days. I still like the first two solo albums he put out a little better, but I've liked just about everything he has put out, and he seems like one of those artists that are incapable of making a bad record."
5,"Man, this guy is great!","Frank's first album with the Catholics was good, but ""Pistolero"" is really great! It is more rounded and diverse than the first one. I only discovered the Pixies recently, and thank goodness! Since then I have purchased almost all Frank's solo efforts. Eagerly awaiting the next release!"
5,Synopsis,"One of the first animated features to be produced in the former Soviet Union. A little boy catches a magical horse who barters for his freedom.Running time 60 minutes, color."
4,Perfect for any home,"I bought this to organize and keep all my special receipes. It was so convient that I bought two more. One for my sister in law when she got married, and one for my mom. They all loved it. It's small enogh that it wont take up a lot of room if you want to keep it on your counter, and has enough space to hold plenty of your favorite and secret receipes!"
2,need extra pages,I ordered this but do not see any additional pages and I have already filled mine. I see large pages but I need the smaller ones that came with the cover. Please help! Also could use more of the recipe cards that match it but I don't see them either.
2,Binder could be bigger,It's nice that this is compact but I think price related it should cost less or the binder be a little bigger. I am giving this as Christmas Gift and a little disappointed in it's size.
1,Unsimple One Touch,I returned this item because the instructions were so poorly written I could not begin to connect it to my MacIntosh G4. It may have been great if I could have figured out how to use it.
1,Don't buy if you have a front-loading CD/DVD driver (e.g. Powerbook),"The installation software comes on a small-sized CD which any front-loading CD/DVD drive can not handle (and will break your laptop). Luckily, I called tech support before inserting it into the drive, because I've since heard of others who had to find unusual ways of getting the small CD out of their drive.Also, the accompanying instructions are minimal at best. I'd avoid!"
4,Doses of comedy,"A. Saptrishi Films' BETI NO. 1, directed by T. Rama Rao, is a social with ample doses of comedy.The scenes between Govinda and Johny Lever keep you in splits at some places. Viju Shah's music has two okay numbers 'Tune Jo Liya Mera Chumma' and 'Mehfil Ta Sajdi'. Dialogues are well penned at places. Cinematography is mediocre.Aroona Irani is very loud. This performance may work at small centres though. One has witnessed the on-screen chemistry between Govinda and Johny Lever in several films and this time too, the duo enact their parts with ease."
4,color Canberra't without you,OPI is a good quality polish that I have used for years. This color is a neutral color that can be worn with anything. Not at all flashy. I did not know if I was going to like at first but after wearing a week I grew to like the color and fact it does not clash with any colors I wear. Is a good color for work.
4,Worth it for a free book...,"I think it was overall a good story. It starts off kind of slow, and there's some confusing points at the beginning that take awhile to get connected. But, once the story does finally get going, you can tell there's truly a much more complex story than is initially presented. The story starts off with Brian LaPorte being pushed off a balcony by what appears to be a woman in denial. However, then a friend of his named Rita, whom he met online, gets ran off the road...in a separate state. The author takes us through her coma, his coma, and the results of their meeting in ""the gray place."" The clues unravel from there, leading Brian's brother Christopher to Boston to confront Rita, and Rita down to New Orleans to meet Brian face to face, even though he's still in his coma. She and Christopher end up working together to solve the mystery of what happened to his brother...and working through their own eerily similar pasts."
3,Started Good But Got Silly,"It took me a while to read through this book. The beginning of the story was very interesting and I looked forward to finding out how everything would pan out. Later on, it strayed into silliness.There was definitely a neat twist on the question of 'Whodunnit?' and some of the characters were very intriguing...the lead male character, Christopher, among them. I simply couldn't warm up to the female protagonist, however. While I admired her tenacity at getting to the bottom of they mystery surrounding what had happened to her friend, a lot of her actions came across as silly especially for someone who is a psychologist.I also felt that the inclusion of a romance between the two title characters took too much away from the tight, well written mystery. I found myself skipping parts of the story so I could get back to the mystery aspect.This book was excellent in some areas and yet weak in others."
4,Great find,I really enjoyed this little gem. I wouldn't have tried this author normally but the book was cheap so I gave it a shot. I really liked it and could barely set it down.
2,It was interesting...at first,"The book started off interesting, a mix of an intriguing mystery and a daunting romance while some might say the dash of paranormal was to much I felt it pulled the reader in making them ask more and more questions(as a good suspense should) like a high speed chase that only got more dangerous as it continued and then it stopped. I'd hate to spoil it for people interested in reading this book but a little more than halfway through the book I felt as if between all the twist and turns the author had gotten lost and in an attempt to stop from further confusing herself took a u-turn and what should have been a stunning and dangerous reveal was cliche,annoying,disturbing and at parts downright childish. Now you may ask how can a book go from a high speed suspense to downright awful well to find that out you'd have to read the book but here's my advice instead, why don't you save your time, your money and just read another book."
4,Good read,"This was an intense and suspenseful read. It kept you on the edge of the seat until everything could be resolved. You really wanted the main characters to work things out. This story mixed suspense, mystery, and romance."
4,"What She Doesn""t Know",A little difficult to get into but a good suspense as well as romantic novel. I would read more of Jaime Rush.
3,Disappointing...,"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt I had to for this one. It wasn't a terrible book, it just wasn't that good. Halfway through I had to force myself to keep picking it up and read to the end. Even with the touch of paranormal to make it interesting, it still fell flat. I read ""Now You See Me"" and thought this one would be as good. I was wrong. In addition, the ending was a total let down. The conclusion was rushed, and felt forced, like she ran out of ""oomph"". If I hadn't already bought ""I'll Be Watching You"", I wouldn't read any more of her books. I hope that one is better."
4,Not as funny as the Groucho Letters...,"A lot of the material in this book shows up in many of Groucho's other books, but the new material is very entertaining. Not quite as funny as the Groucho Letters, but a must for any Groucho fan..."
2,Disappointed,"I thought it was a collection of funny quotes and stories, instead it's mainly a collection of editorials and articles written by Groucho over different subjects in his lifetime."
5,Both the Sword and the Brush becomes an extension of the self.,"This is a must read for any serious practitioner of budo.Dave Lowry is in top form as he explains the the deeper meaning of Kanjis that a budoka might encounter as they progress in their training.This is an essential guide to understanding what we can learn from the time spent ""In the Dojo"" and how it could transfer to our daily lives."
4,The Next Big Thing,"I LOVED THIS CD! Not only did I love listening to this beautiful music, but the lyrics truly grabbed me. You could tell that these were words that were written from the heart and soul. I was lucky enough to see the artist in person and let me tell you he is even better live. Favorite songs: Not Quite Enough, Maggie's Mine, After All and Everybody has a Song. I can't wait to see what is coming next for this talented performer. But trust me, keep you eyes out, he is going to be the next big thing."
5,Sheer Greatness!,"I very much enjoyed Spencer's debut album as I thought it reflected many of societies' pyschological maladjustments (childhood and growing up in a harsh reality). I particularly enjoyed the second track on the album, Maggies'Mine, and its up-beat rhythm which left me in a very positive state of mind. The song also delt with topics of which I could very much relate.I am very proud of Spencer's achievements and wish him best in his journey to stardom. In addition, I would like to add that all those people with ""not so kind"" reviews probably lack the talent, dedication and creativeness to even produce their own album."
1,These5 star reviews are wrong in my opinion,"Listen to some of this CD free before you buy it. You'll find the horrible, cliched lyrics are eclipsed only by the nauseating arrangements eclipsed only by the horrendous vocals. Have you ever watched a really, really bad audition on ""American Idol"" and cringed at the patsy's cluelessness about their lack of any viable musical talent? This is an entire of CD of that experience."
2,A Disappointment,"Overall this album was disappointing for me. While some of the melodies were agreeable, the lyrics lacked originality and were often trite. The most lacking part of the album, though, is not the lyrics but Spencer's voice. He seems determined to push his voice beyond its capabilities and this results in an almost painful nasal sound on several songs that forced me to change tracks. The slower tracks are more pleasant to listen to, but overall there's really just not very much here to merit a purchase."
1,"ugh, stay away","I've heard four of the tracks on this album. They're produced well, but it's the kind of music you'd play if you were a highschool kid with minimal keyboard skills to impress vacuous girls. Don't let the slick production fool you, these tired chord progressions and the mediocre singing make the... lyrics even less tolerable. Do not buy this album..."
4,spencer bates...a work of art,Spencer bates is single handedly one of the most talented guys out there and Everybody has a song is a wonderful cd. his poetic lyrics are heart felt and at times heart breaking. There isnt a single song on this cd that i dont like. I recomend it for anyone and everyone.
5,A VERY GOOD STORY!,"This is Mr. Ciencin's third Godzilla novel and I would have to say it's his best.The plot is about a space rock that crashes near a kid named Troy's house and tells him that Ghidorah is coming to earth. And the rock tels Troy how to defeat it. Meanwhile, Godzilla has his hands full keeping the peace on Monster Island with help from his friend Anguirus. When Ghidorah comes and threatens the peace Godzilla and his monster friends defend their home from the space dragon in a well written battle. This book has a clever and unique ending too. I like how Mr. Ciencin takes the time to describe Godzilla's personality and feelings, which makes the character more fun to read about. That is one of the most unique part about his novels - he describes the monsters as almost people with feelings and personalities. A nicely done Godzilla book that is entertaining for all G-Fans!"
3,OK book.,Scott Ciencin don`t know much about Godzilla. G`s atomic breath almost kills Ghidorah in the movie G. vs. King Ghidorah not warm him up. Godzilla can fight Ghidorah by him self.He used many old Toho monsters and made up new ones. All in all I give it 3 stars.
4,Excellent primer to proper bible study,This book teaches what most parish education programs fail to... how to move beyond the childhood understanding of bible stories to a true understanding. It gives insight into the different literary forms used in the bible and guides you on how to understand what is written by also advising to consider the audience it was first written for.I recommend this book for anyone want to better understand 'how' to read the bible.
5,Hard yet innovative rock,"The hard yet innovative rock of Fleming and John on Delusions of Grandeur puts most contemporary rock bands to shame. One has only to listen to Letters In My Head to hear this. In some ways, their rock is simple. Screamed lyrics and super-cool, thrashing guitar have been rock standards for decades. Yet they manage to achieve a very musical sound, with tunes that will get in your head and not annoy you while they're there. For those who like thought-provoking lyrics, their message is certainly not that of most cookie-cutter rock hits. Listen and learn."
4,Refresh,I was amazed on the first two days on the accumulation of toxin from both of my feet. I didnot have that slowness in getting out of bed in the morning to go to work. I felt rejuvenate.
4,Good,"Kinda pricey but they did seem to work well.I wish there was a large size, as 10 were gone in three days, with my hubby only having it on two nights."
1,Not as Good,"None of these detox foot pads I see for sale ever compare to the ones I've ordered from www.purifyyourbody.com. The service is wonderful and the detox foot pads are even better. I've never slept better and felt as good as I do when using these. I was skeptical at first, but after hearing from my sister-in-law (who also uses the pads) about the testing she had done on her used foot pads along with a ""control"" unused, I have come to know with certainty that they do the job I need them to. I would reccomend the foot pads you'll find at www.purifyyourbody.com over any other brand!!"
3,Important question,"I want food detox pads to work, but until I see a lab analysis of the spent pad--just what is on it that was not when it was applied, and that is not a result of reactivity with oxygen in the air--I cannot believe it is effective."
2,Not for me...,"I decided to try these tampons since they were cheaper than the other leading brands. My mistake. I bought the super sized and they are HUGE! They are at least a 1/4 inch wider in diameter than the super plus tampon of another major brand. I would have been scared of these things if I hadn't had two kids. I would not suggest these tampons to anyone with a light flow. The tampon itself is rectangular and is not comfortable when you remove it (even when saturated), plus the string is quite flimsy. The applicator is alright, but it can scratch when you insert it. The only good thing about this tampon is that it didn't leak. It's back to the old tampons for me! The few extra dollars are worth the comfort."
1,Beginning Banjo Volume 1,"It was a waiste of my money . The instructions where not very plain and and the person played way to fast to grasp any instruction , I also bought Beginning Banjo 2I did not even open it cause I know it would be a waist of my time . I wish I could send it back a get my money back , It would cost me to much for postage...Don..."
5,Guitar Player Turned Banjo Player In One Week,"I started out my banjo quest by going on You Tube and just getting some ideas. However, I am much better picking out 1 plan and moving forward with it. Judging from what I heard about the Murphy Method I figured this was the best way to go.If you have played guitar this dvd is absolutely perfect and very achievable.I worked on the first song while learning hand position, etc and pretty much had it down within a week or so with about 20-30 mins practice a day average. Some days none, some days a lot more. Man I had some fun though.If you have never played guitar or any other stringed instrument this dvd will challenge you right off the bat. If you go nice and slow I think you will be just fine. I hate learning instruments with sheet music or tab because they slow down the learning process so much. You don't have to worry about that here.I highly recommend this product.KT"
5,Awsome guitar,Oscar Moore was the guitarist for the Nat King Cole Trio. He had an incredible guitar style all his own. He had a sophisticated sense of harmony and could comp some great chord lines as well as being a very hot soloist. I have loved this disc since the very first time I heard it.
1,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed by this software! I can see this product working well if you have basic knowledge of the language your trying to learn more. I purchased Lesson one Tagalog and I was lost... It shows you pictures of things and shows you the words for them but not an actual translation in english. In one example it shows a wood block with a blue number 6 in it then the software types and reads the words in tagalog over the picture...at this point I had no idea if the word meant wood block, blue or six because it doesn't show translations in english!This is not the first choice for learning a language if you do not have a basic understanding of it first."
2,Really don't get unless you have prior knowledge.,So I have access to this product (or either most of the main features of this product) because this is provided free to DoD personnel and their dependents. While I've been using this as mainly a refresher it really isnt good for anyone who has no knowledge of it so far it seems to just thrust you with pictures and a rehashed sentence over and over...is this their method? Not once heretofore have I seen any explanation on grammar and such. By lesson 2 they were using conjugated verbs! If you have already studied this then you know that that's not something you just thrust at someone especially... Though I will say that this program has by far the best audio quality for listening to pronounciations.
1,Buyer beware,"Real seat of your pants flying on a foggy night experience without instruments. Rosetta Stone is NOT the way to go to acquire another language unless you have someone familiar with the language guide you. Having had experience using software that works from basic to intermediate levels, this one is the pits by comparison. Better have the ability to decide whether you will be happy with the program while just looking at the box, because once you open it, you're stuck with it. Makes for pretty expensive garbage...."
3,Fun,I bought Spencer to go along with the other HO Thomas Tank engines for our HO train tracks. It is a great addition to add to your collection. Spencer arrived in a timely manner and brand new package like I bought it at the store. Thank you.
4,Very Happy with product.,Like the crackers. Like the ingredients list. Only complaint is they tend to break rather than crack along serations. This is probably largely a function of the lack of bad fats and low overall fat content. I'll take the cracking issue over higher fat level every time.
1,crumby product,"Product should be called ""Wellington Stoned Wheat Crumbs"" since there are so many crumbs instead of crackers. If you like crumbs, this product is for you."
5,Great Read,"I had this book for a Film History class, and it was great. I've used it every semester since and plan to keep it forever and sleep with it under my pillow.Even though it isn't aimed at teaching film theory or basics, it's better at explaining the basics than Film Art by miles. It also makes theory more interesting and topical to learn since it goes chronologically and highlights films that were actually influential, instead of the ones that Film Art just happened to get the rights to print pictures of.Highly recommend."
4,Textbook,I got this for a foundations of cinema class. The book was relevant to the class and informative. This book was hard to read.
1,mold for passanger side off... second vent the same as the first... doesnt fitll,avs auto ventshade for hundai tusonfront driver side vent fits fine... left side is off... their mold for making the passenger side front ventshade is defective and doesnt fit properly on the car... about a half inch off... looks funny... i complained and got sent a second set of ventshades... same problem with the second set... what can i do ????
2,Does not fit,Amazons website states that this fits the 2010 Tucson but it does not. I contacted AVS and they will not have one available till September/October of this year. This item only fits up to 2009.
3,Weak Crayon,"I'm a Spongebob fanatic and it's a good thing with this toy. Like the other review says, it doesn't stay together well, it's high maintenance in that respect. Then the crayon, that doesn't write too well on the pages. We tried a few Audio/Visual markers, still didn't work great. Then we tried the Expo white board markers and that was a bust too. It's a good shelf sitter, but not good for kids to play with."
3,A waste of time.,"My 3 1/2 year old picked this out for himself in the store. So for a couple of bucks I figured OK. Within 3 days he had all the pages out of the spiral loop. I put it back together just for him to take it apart again & again. I think they should make it so the pages can't come off. He did like to scribble on it, but I got sick of finding pages all over the house & finally threw it out."
4,Frontside- Hybrid on Acid,"This duo from Melbourne combine acid, hard 909 kicks and general breakbeat mayhem, to make a generall awesome album. Their track 'Dammerung"" features on Norther Exposure 2, Sasha mix and is one of the stand out tracks of their album- on the more trancey side, yet still with unique beats. ""LBP"" is a combination of a guitar loop, a beautifully breaky beat and 303 lines. The last two tracks are the most major disappointment, with their attempt at a more ""four on the floor"" oriented songs which fail miserably. By this album if you like breakbeats, acid with a hint of trance occasionally..."
4,Ranging from Big Beat to Drum 'n Bass to Trance,"Frontside definitely embraces raveland and its phat beats and high powered drugs (track 1). ""L.B.P."" and ""Evol"" are as thumping and as irresistable as want dance tracks to be. ""Kate Moss"" and ""Dammerung"" hover near the trance vibe successfully. However, the remainder of the album tends to drone and requires serious commitment or heavy intoxication for the full effect."
3,Good Recipes--to much alcohol,"The majority of the recipes in this cookbook are good and use ""normal"" ingredients. One flaw and this is not listed anywhere in the reviews is that a large number of the recipes call for alcohol. I believe this is an important piece of information that should be brought to buyers attention. Some people can not cook using alcohol."
3,Not what I thought I ordered,It isn't a mattress encasing at all- it is a super tight woven sheet. I feel ripped off. How is it supposed to keep out all the allergens and dust particles when it doesn't even cover the whole mattress. How is this thing really $68? Come on!
2,"just a fitted bed sheet, not an actual anti-allergy cover","I was looking for an allergen-proof cover that fit a standard (9"" high) mattress. Seems this is difficult to locate in the modern era, with the proliferation of pillow-top mattresses. This seemed to fit the bill, but upon receipt I found it is just a fitted bed sheet. It may have a very dense thread count but it just goes on top and over the corners. It does not envelope the mattress and close with a zipper. In light of this I felt the price was not justified at all, but life is too busy to deal with the hassle of returning and seeking a refund."
5,Quietly splendid...,"Victoria BC native Susan Scott plays traditional Christmas carols on a hand crafted celtic harp and the result is simply splendid. The carols are familiar (Good King Wenceslas) and not as well known (The Huron carol).The music is played with respect and joy that can be felt as well as heard. Scott plays the flute and chimes in addition and they blend seamlessly in the arrangements of these songs. This disc is soft and gentle and as a result, the emotion of the music comes through clearly."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I made the grave mistake of purchasing this software without the benefit of a trial period. I could not get it to work, went to the manufacturer's website and downloaded a patch/new version and then it wouldn't load. I got an error that, according to the manufacturer ""shouldn't matter"". Thier customer support was terrible and they refuse to stand buy their product, saying that I'd have to return it to the place of purchase. of course as opened software, the seller wouldn't take it back.This product was a total waste of money. To top it all off it was very difficult to remove the program from my computer!"
1,Very Displeased,This product fails to explain on the packaging that it will not convert commercial movie files.
5,It Rocks!,I pretty much like all the songs in this album they have a great energy and vibe that gets you in the mood!
5,work saver,Wish I had purchased this item 3 monts ago/// the pine trees were giving me a fit while they were dropping whatever you call what they shed/// this item saved the day for me/// I know it will be used again this fall when the trees start their thing.
2,Adequate.,"Adequate item for price. Complaints would be holes in net larger than I would personally like and supplied plastic stakes cheap, forcing me to get metal U-shaped lawn staples from Lowes."
1,A Total Rip-off,"Although a very good live album in its own right, this is nothing more than a repackaged ""Lou Reed Live"". If you already own it do not buy this. Misleading titling fools the customer."
5,Best singer songwriter on the planet,"Mary Chapin does it again. How does so muchtalent get packaged in such a short person. You wouldn't want her on your basketball team , but she belongs on your music system."
1,A completely uninformed approach to autism,"I've been learning the Son-Rise Program as a volunteer with a family which practices it, and what I saw in this family did not make sense to me, so I read ""The Miracle Continues"" for more information. What I found was that the author and his family founded Son-Rise not based on any real knowledge of autism, but on New Age beliefs. The book is full of pseudo-Buddhist writings about the power of positive thinking, but contains very little accurate information about autism.From what I have seen, the Son-Rise Program is very much like a cult, promising the impossible (""recovery"" from autism) to people who attend their workshops and pay for their services. It didn't surprise me at all to read a study which showed that families involved with Son-Rise experience negative outcomes over time."
5,A sharing,Son-rise the miracle continues gave me hope. All hope was drained away from me when we were given the diagnosis of ASD. As a result of reading this book we took our son to the Autism Treatment Center of America.This treatment changed our lives forever. Ewan went from a boy who spoke on 2/3 word sentences to now where you can have a wonderful conversation. He is in mainstream education and doing well. This is beyond my wildest dreams.Give yourself an opportunity of a win/win situation.If you read the book you may decide this is the program for you. A winning situation. You may decide you don't like what you read. Again you win because you discovered something you don't want.
4,Son-rise review,"I cannot give you a review yet because I have not received my copy yet. But based upon my reading the original book & seeing the tv movie, I found it very interesting & informative."
4,Much better than the Original,"I had purchased the original for my then 3 year old, but it didn't last long when two of the character pieces(the player pieces you move across the board) got wet and would not go into the base to hold them up. They are made of cardboard, and not resistance at all...plus they bend easily too. This one is exceptional, and the figurines are made of plastic, so no worries there. The characters are all on the board as well, (Tiko, Isa, Swipper, ect) and make the game slot more fun...the other canday, to me is boring. This one is worth any extra you have to pay and it's good for boys or girls!"
4,Great Game for little Dora Fans!,"I just recieved this game in the mail today and played it with my daughter that is 3 1/2 years old, She loves Dora! She was very excited to play this game and it was hard to keep her from wanting to move the pieces in the wrong places. She wanted to play with all the characters but had to realize you can only use 2 of them when playing with just 2 people. She liked that at the end of the game Dora (or whomever you choose to play with) gets to go to a party at the end of the game. It is a fun game for little kids. I don't think this game is very educational for my daughter since she already knows all her colors. But, if it teaches patience, that might just help in the future. The figures that come with this game are pretty durable and can make nice little toys if your child became bored with the game."
1,Wish I could get this game,"First time I ordered this version, I received a different version--the one with the cardboard characters as the pieces, which sells for $12.99 in Toys R Us. This version has plastic playing pieces. I sent it back and ordered it a second time. Got the same different version I received the first time. I wrote to the vendor and was informed that it was Amazon who made the error. I'm sending this one back too. I only gave this game one star because it was not the version that I wanted."
4,Fun for a 3-4 year old,"We received this as a gift for our child. She loves Dora and enjoys playing the game to see which character will get to the fiesta first. It's been good for teaching her about colors and counting. If your child likes Dora this will be a hit, otherwise you might as well get the regular Candyland version."
2,Did not work,One of the light sockets did not work. Had to have an electrician rewire it. Otherwise the product is as pictured.
4,Most Are Great,"Although there are a few cuts that I am not thrilled with, over all, this album adds some interesting cuts to my library, originally recorded by the best band of all time. It does have the Memphis feel throughout. Unfortunate that a few of the bands should have stayed in the lounges."
5,FIVE STARS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS ALBUM,"THREE ACOUSTIC GUITARS. NOTHING ELSE. THREE JAZZ GUITAR VIRTUOSOS: LARRY CORYELL, JOHN SCOFIELD, JOE BECK. BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. BUY IT. YOU WILL LOVE IT."
1,Disappointed,"This book is supposed to be written for the "" young "" reader. It is a translation appearently from an original "" Olde English "" work, but the language of the translation has not been updated into a modern form. I found it exceptionally difficult to read even as an educated adult. Grappling with the "" language "" really took away from the flow of the stories. I cannot believe that a "" young "" reader would persevere or find the book enjoyable and so would not suggest it for this group."
5,ONE MILLION STARS,"I have seen these boys live soooo many times and have listened to this CD more times than I can count, and I'm still not sick of it. Call me a loyal Canadian but these guys should be THE next big thing (if I had anything to do with it). They go so easily from crazy rock (over-ripe) to somewhat of a pop sound (walkabout) with a little ska and rap thrown in too. AMAZING! Some good lyrics thrown in with obvious emotion and energy and complete creativity makes this the best CD i have and i have over a thousand. I cant say enough about these guys. Buy it!!!!! You won't regret it. If you do, well, you probably like the backstreet boys or something. PS Hounds is good for a laugh"
3,a pretty cool cd but i was dissapointed,"DDT was a very good band in concert, i saw them as an opening act for powerman 5000 and kidrock. i really like hard and heavy music and thats what they were, in concert. i likeed them so much that i got the cd at the show and got it signed, but it was not half as good."
1,This was a weak at best CD,DDT are high on themselves. They think they are rock stars but they are not. They need alot more polishing and need to keep their feet on the ground if they want to make it any where in this business.
4,Printer as received and performance,The printer packaging was very good and was received in good condition.Since hooking it up it has performed very well and is used everyday.
5,Mrs Jackie Ransoms 'The Bichon Frisé Today.',"Mrs Jackie Ransom's latest book `The Bichon Frisé Today' maintains her excellent standard of presentation which is to be found in all her previous titles. The current book is undoubtedly an essential for those who are new to the breed. It not only gives a short history of the origins of the breed it also gives advice on the choosing, rearing and training the first puppy and then talks the new owner through the facets of bathing, grooming, and eventually, showing their new acquisition. This is a must for all new comers; it also has a lot to interest those already in the breed. A well produced volume with a profusion of lovely photographs of past and present champions, which should be on all Bichon owners' bookshelves."
5,Side by Side Leadership: Achieving Outstanding Results Together,"Was used as a textbook, but is an excellent reference book for managers."
3,Family puppets,"These puppets were purchased to use as a play therapy tool for children (in my therapeutic practice). They definitely work, however, the hair is a little flimsy, with peices of it sort of shedding a bit. Otherwise for the money, they do the trick and kids so far have enjoyed them!"
2,If golf was this simple everyone would be a pro.,I could not believe Butch created a video with so little info. His video on the full swing was only a few tips. And he made it sound like if you do one thing in your swing then you will hit great shots. Maybe he didn't want to give away his family secrets. I gave it 2 stars because of a lack of info. Try David Leadbetters Full Swing video. He builds it from scratch and shows you what you need to do and know.
4,white shower rod,"shower rod works good, looks good. A little shaky, but much better than other brand for same money bought at bed, bath and beyond."
5,You need one of these,The product arrive perfect. Probably no small feat shipping something 5 feet long. I installed it and it made my bathroom look brand new. I also bought a shower curtain with built in rings. The combo works great.
1,slave of the cannibal god - flesh feast,"I was very disturbed by the movie ""Slave of the Cannibal God"". There are great deal of scenes in which animals are placed in scenes together and filmed fighting to the death. Most disturbing was a scene early in the film in which a monkey is being eaten alive by a snake. I threw my copy of this movie away and suggest others do the same. I am a fan a horror movies but this is an example of trash and animal cruelty."
5,FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,"This is Jim W. Goll, the author of this book. I want to share briefly with you from my heart about this book. While the primary theme of this book is identificational repentance, a great deal of teaching is done here to uncover historic sins of the church and those particularly relating to us in North America. With a readalbe syle but with accurate research we delve into the problems of The Clergy Versus the Laity, The Gender Gap, The Genocide of the Jews, The First Nations Massacre, The Enlsavement of a People and the Sins of Greed and Idolatry. Read the endorsements - read it for yourself. It will be worth your investment and you will be given a heart cry to join in with me, ""Father Forgive Us!"""
4,Classic tale with a few twists and animal information,"What I loved about this book was the variety of animals it featured, everything from a cheetah to a giraffe, to a sloth and a lorikeet! Not to mention that at the end of the book are little facts about each of the animals - like which is the slowest animal in the world, the fastest, etc.The illustrations were quite nice as well - pretty accurate, but still with a child-friendly cuteness.The story itself is pretty much the same as always but it includes a few fun twists because of the variety of animals. I can't help but feel a little sorry for the hare, but it is a story of consequences, so it dose have its place.If you can find this, I'd definitely pick it up - it's a fun treat on every page."
2,Bought because Dr. Oz recommended but,"It completely irritates my stomach, whether I take with food or not. I couldn't take for more than two days."
2,"Was not sent what I had purchased. Does not say white kidney bean anywhere, even in the ingredients list, only a diet sup.","Totally disappointed because what I was sent was not what I had ordered.Only a diet supplement in research study. Does not state 500 mg anywhereon label, nor white kidney bean in the ingredients. Only states 'support yourwieght loss goals. The name of the product received is LipoNexol, NOT WhiteKidney Bean. The price was high and then to not receive the correct item isNot right."
4,white kidney bean extract,"I am not sure if it really works or if it's just another gimmick. If nothing more, it's probably healthy whereas it's made from white beans. Thanks. Mary"
5,Read it & was surprised!!,"I read the book a few weeks ago. (Actually, I'm older, but don't have an e-mail address,... so I'll submit a review in this manner: from Public Library.) The book had many interesting turns inside its covers. I THOUGHT I about had it figured -where it was going come home, across the plate- but then its widest & wildest curve got by me at the end. The surprizes made it fun! --Richard Starke, Fargo, North Dakota"
4,All went just fine,"The t shirt arrived on time. The size was the correct one. The package just fine as well.The communication with e-mails and all that stuff was at the expectable good level.No problem at all, thanx!"
1,"sloppily written, incomplete, waste of money","Why do books like this even get published? As a reference book, it's too incomplete to be of use. Harkness's own assessments of the various winners are too brief, perfunctory, and devoid of wit to be of any real interest. Maybe the writing of too many capsule reviews for NOW magazine has turned Harkness's mind to mush. It's hard to say which more amply demonstrates the ""great"" man's dearth of talent or intellect, this book or his weekly reviews, but either way, it's pretty obvious Harkness isn't exactly the William Hazlitt of film critics. A shoddily compiled handbook, fit candidate for the dustbin of history."
5,Buy it...you'll be glad you did!,Brown and McMahon team up to deliver one heck of an entertaining read!
1,This book gives me no results-I'm at page 300!,"No visual help, no logical sequencing, no decent results, andI'm almost halfway through the ... book! It's almost as if the authors are forcing us to read the entire book before answering questions that should have been revealed in chapter one and two! Reading a book from end to end is important, but wastng our time by structuring the book so we HAVE to read from cover to cover is wasting our time. I regret buying this book."
1,A poorly written book,This book is long and boring. It keeps promising that it will show you good stuff but after 400 pages I am still not sure what it wants to explain. The first three chapters are an idiotic attempt to explain the difference between XML and HTML. Then at the end of each it always says it will become clear if you keep reading. Apparently the authors are not knowledgable enough to write a technical book and they haven't grasped the essense of XML. Sure they can write a lot but all the pages are made of long paragraphes that don't make much sence. I will be much better of just reading the spec. This book is a waste of time and money. My impression is every so called black book is poorly written. I give it one star because this is the lowest rating I could give.
1,indispensible problem solver?,"this is the book i use to prop my monitor up to the correct height. thus, it did solve one problem."
2,Poorly Organized and Not Very Informative,"I regret buying this book. There is no coherent logical structure to the book. Each chapter seems to have been written in isolation to the others. As a result, simple material covered in earlier chapters is repeated again and again, and some material that should be presented early in the book is left until far too late (e.g. XML entities are left until after XLink!). Simple to grasp ideas are constantly re-explained from chapter to chapter, while more complex issues (e.g. some of the DTD syntax) are skimmed over are not explained at all (one suspects the authors did not understand them).There is also too much ""selling"" of XML. Fine, the intro explains why XML is better than HTML, but why is this repeated again and again in each chapter?"
1,"A novel, not a technical book",I am very regreted to buy this book. If you like to read novel book then this book is for you. Not a technical book or a problem solving in XML. Look somewhere else. Sun website XML tutorial is way much better.
1,Nothing useful for a programmer,"This was the first XML book I bought, I new less after trying to plogh through he book that I knew before. Misses the target."
4,A Little Help,"This review is from http://www.allmusic.comCause there aren't really any reviews on this great EP that would actually help an interested customer.""Melvins' love for Kiss goes far beyond most fans, for these set of three EP's each member of the band recorded a record of their own and released it exactly as Kiss did in 1978, right down to the parodies of the artwork. Dale Dale Crover features singing from the quiet Melvin, and his songs examine the world of grunge and power-punk not unlike the efforts of Dinosaur Jr. or Sonic Youth. Out of the bunch, Craver's record is the most accessible. Separately all of them stand out as highly original, but they should be purchased as a set. - John Book"""
3,Doesn't play to Crover's strengths,"Known as the precision-powerhouse drummer for the Melvins, Dale Crover uses his solo EP to show off some decidedly secondary skills (guitar, vox). Could have been much better."
2,Poorly Researched,"Toland has written some outstanding books to include, THE RISING SUN and BUT NOT IN SHAME. However, IN MORTAL COMBAT is sloppy. He routinely makes mistakes when describing Anerican Army combat units and their role in the war. Moreover, he has lionized ceratin commanders, like Gen Walker, who were at best mediocre commanders. The book's only strength is that he made an attempt to tell the story of the North Koreans, too, and for that Toland deserves some credit. Still, for a better history of the war, its hard to beat Roy Appleman's SOUTH TO THE NAKTONG, NORTH TO THE YALU."
3,A good starting point,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I think it's a good starting point to begin studying the Korean War. Like many of the reviewers I found the amount of space spent describing the actions and movements of media people a bit puzzling. I did enjoy reading about General Walker's actions during the Pusan Perimeter battles. One thing that became very clear to me in reading this book is that we really do need good biographies on both Generals Walker and Almond. I am a bit concerned by some of the possible factual errors pointed out in some of the other reviews, and I'll be on the lookout for more accurate versions of those events as I continue to read Korean War books."
2,I've read better accounts.,"Toland interviewed me along with others, for this book. I was there from Aug to Dec. 1950. His accounts of battles is at times pretty accurate, but I think he wandered off in some of his political punditry. I don't believe Mr. Toland did his best work here. Fehrenbach's This Kind of War, is far superior, both in style and content. I never heard anything but sarcasm from the grunt level when Higgins was mentioned. Some of her interviews with the troops were ludicrous. Toland spends more time and effort on her than it's worth."
1,In Mortal Combat,"I was an Infantry Officer in Korea.This author was more focused on the actions of his journalist peers than on meaningful actions of responsible military personnel. Factually he was ""off the wall"" in his accounts of weapons, strategy, and geographical locations.I got through about 75 pages and threw the book into the garbage.Mike Connelly"
3,inaccurate data,"THE BOOK IS OK, BUT TOLAND STATES THAT THE 555 FIELD ART. WAS AND ALL BLACK OUTFIT. NOT TRUE. THE TRIPPLE NICKLE WAS AND ALL WHITE OUTFIT IN 1950-51, AND WAS ATTACHED TO THE 5th R.C.T. DURING THAT TIME."
2,Poorly put together...,"I was surprisingly disappointed with this. I liked the original series. The selected episodes seem intended mainly to explain the change in Robin Hood character (Robin of Huntingdon vs. Robin of Loxley ...clever) and it all seemed like a big set up for a rather minor main plot. Robin was basically getting the band back together (like the Blues Brothers?!). I think earlier episodes with the original Robin, or later episodes with this Robin (blond son of 007 Sean Connery) would probably be a better bet. Failing that get a copy of the King Arthur TV series starring Oliver Tobias (also on VHS) -- which seemed to stand up better."
3,A great way to escape,"While I am more a fan of the earlier series with Michael Praed, I think Jason Connery did an excellent job stepping in to fill the void Michael left when he vacated the series. The writers' transition from one Robin to the next was imaginative and creative. I was a devoted follower of the original series (s), and have been more than pleased at being able to purchase the shows on DVD and vhs!!"
2,Fit too small (for larger sizes),"I am a size 16 (edging into a 14) and thus finding swimsuits can be tough. I ordered a size 42, which should fit a size 15/16, but the suit was many sizes too small. I have a a different suit from Speedo that is a size 40 that fits better than this suit. I am not thrilled. Although I have decided to keep it because I have been losing weight and hope to eventually fit in it, I was ticked off to be back to suit shopping again today."
1,too small,Bought this item one size larger tgen I normally wear and it was arill extremely snug. I also should have paid more attention to how low the cut it in the back. I cant wear this suit at work..
3,"Probably should have bought a different size, hard to tell","I purchased this for tourist season at the gym, and had no idea what size to get. A little more help with sizing information would be good. I probably should have gotten a long torso size suit, but I have no way of knowing. Three stars for that reason. Otherwise it's fine, good value for the price I guess. It's not like I expected the suit to make me less fat."
3,Sizes run small,"The size runs small. I even purchased a size larger than I normally wear (based on the sizing chart), and it's still too tight."
5,praise for this suit,am pleased with the fit and promise of longer lasting wear than my previous lyrca suits.i do recommend swim outlet to others.
3,Too small,"It looked like it might have been an okay suit, but it was way smaller than the sizing chart stated. The price was good, but it wasn't an Amazon Prime option, so I lost money by having to pay for return postage. Lesson learned."
4,GOOD,The fit is just right. Also the fabric is great and the cut is perfect. I am a satisfied customer.
3,Greg Chaisson of Badlands Plays Bass on This CD,"I bought this CD because I was wishing Jake E Lee's Badlands had made more albums and heard this was similar in style. There seemed to be merit to this claim in the fact that Badlands' bass player, Greg Chaisson is featured here. It's true the musical style of this CD is mostly hard driven blues based rock. The guitar work is very very good IMHO and as always Mr. Chaisson wails unfalteringly on bass. Don't look for Ray Gillen quality vocals or lyrics here though."
4,Solid Hard Rock/Christian Metal CD,"... I've been recently re-discovering some older christian hard rock/metal releases lately and came across this one. The lineup is Robin ""Kyle"" Basauri, Chris Howell, Greg Chaisson, & Jeff Martin. Since the latter two I was familiar with while they worked as a bass & drummer respectively with Badlands, I thought I'd give it a shot. Glad I did. What you basically get is a band that sounds very much like Badlands but also with lyrics dealing with Christian subjects. Howell may not be as technically proficient on the guitar as Jake E. Lee, but he definitely can get the job done. Basauri's vocals are raw but can also be melodic. I have never heard of him before, but he reminded me of a cross between Ray Gillen and Steve Snyder from Arch Rival. Definitely worth checking out."
5,Get this book for the support you need,"Dr. Elayne's words touch your heart and provide the support you need tomake changes that improve your life. You'll be glad that you read this book.Tom MarcouxAmerica's Communication Coach, [...]CEO and author ofBe Heard and Be Trusted: How You Can Use Secrets of the Greatest Communicators to Get What You Want"
4,Interesting Collection of Ancient Music,"For fans of recorder, aulos, and ancient music, this collection is both interesting and entertaining. The first duo of pieces are a bit repetitive, but the second set becomes much more melodic and enjoyable. The rest of the album contains several difficult pieces as well, but much of it is quite beautiful. The total effect does transport you back to Ancient Greece, in ways that only music can do."
5,A Live Set Like None Other,"This is an album that sits right in the middle of the band's progression from being a cover band to becoming the full-out original jam band that they have become, which means that this album has a lot of Wu originals as well as a lot of classic blues, Grateful Dead, and even a bit of Led Zeppelin. For a bootleg album, the mic-ing was perfect, giving you a very clean live recording that still captures the sound of the CCC where they played. Listening through a powerful stereo system is nice, but listening to this album through headphones is an absolute auditory treat.Some of the tracks are a little shaky, like Silcanturnitova and Take The World By Storm, but these can still be fun to listen to, and its the versions of Wu-original ""Elani"" and ""Bird On The Wing,"" along with the classic ""Dark Star"" are absolutely epic. Definitely one of my favorite albums. Great for road trips!"
3,Tough to install... but good quality,"How would you feel if the screws that come with your package dont actually fit in the locks. The main lock is fine, but the bolt lock has nuts smaller than the screws. Its almost impossible to fit those screws in. I went hunting for the right size screw at a local homedepot and the size is hard to find with the color / cap requirements.I am happy with the quality, its sturdy, but might have to return the whole set if the bolt does not work."
2,Deflated after Day 2-3,Not sure what's in the air but this year I've spent more on pool floats than I normally would have in previous years and they're not even making it into the official summer season. This is a really pretty float and super comfy but has already developed 2 smalls holes somehow and now's it deflating. So much for the reviews ... going to try and patch the holes up and hopefully it'll last at least until summer becomes official.
2,raft/lounger,"Delivery was good, but this raft is not sturdy, nor is it very comfortable, hard to lay comfortably on your stomach for backside tanning."
4,enlightenment through nature,A delightful and unique expression of one person's process and experience of enlightnement. Part of a trilogy.
5,I love this book!,Perfect! Just what I need right now! I'd like to read more of Michael's books. Loved Talking with nature. Changed my life!
4,still got it,Maybe not as good as atomic arena but a good cd none the less. I thought they did a good job of mixing up the heavy guitar with the twelve string acoustic. I listen to this cd often!
3,pretty good first effort,"This movie makes you appreciate all that it takes to make a good movie. One thing is definitely good acting. The majority of the acting in ""One Good Sin"" is definitely amateur, with maybe a couple of exceptions. Another part of the formula can be special effects. There are no high tech effects here, but I was impressed with how they made do with what was available to them. Music is another ingredient, I would say that this category is where ""Nick Romero"" scored highest. The music set the appropriate tone for scenes throughout the movie. So, like my review title says, I consider this a pretty good first effort from Park and writer Travis Nakasone. Overall, a decently entertaining movie."
4,Gift for Christmas - Boyfriend Loves it!,I gave this 70's compilation to my boyfriend for Christmas. I love it. It has both slow and fast songs on it that really took us back! You can't go wrong with this CD! Enjoy!
2,Not What I Was Hoping For ...,"Really not what I was hoping for. Very basic and generic stuff like ball position and swing within self etc. Does not contain the real juicy goods we all want -- ie the Tiger / Scott takeaway and forearm rotation, wrist set, etc.Interviews with Butch between lessions was interesting.All in all .. you probably already know all this stuff."
1,Missing book.,"Received only one volume, package was damaged and rewraped by PO. Stamp said package was damaged in transit, USPS says sorry. Book seller says they will look for another copy of vol. 6, but I'm out $8-9 I don't know the total amount."
1,This book is not about dogs. It's about Macho Men.,I bought this book because I wanted to find out more about War Dogs.Wrong! It's all about Vietnam Veterans telling stories about Vietnam and about catching crooks when they came back and became cops. Less than 10% of this book is actually about dogs. You get lots of talk however about how noble a cause Vietnam was.
5,K-9 Soldiers a SUPER read,"K-9 SOLDIERS Vietnam and After by Paul B. Morgan is a genuine story of a man and his best friend(s), in war and peace. This is a hard book to put down, until you have turned it's last page. The mutual love and devoted service of man's animal friend comes across in the tales of war in Vietnam and combatting crime on the city streets in peacetme. Along the way, we get the precious vision on how a young man matures through his military career, and in his post-service occupation as a dog handler. Paul Morgan is a natural story teller, and his personal accounts, with his K-9 soldiers, is an enjoyable and touching read. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Vietnam, veterans, and service dogsI heard that, Paul has a new book coming out soon, entitled ""Parrot's Beak"". I'm looking forward to reading it.Larry Healey 484 BWH, SAC USAF 1964-1966"
2,An interesting but diffuse mix,"Brueggemann is as always a good writer and his commentary is easy to read and very interesting. Howevever, a major problem is that it is difficult to dicern what he actually is commenting. Is it the literary text or the historical events? When Brueggemann for instance discusses Samuel or David he mixes the logic so that you never now if he is talking about the character or the ""real, historic"" persons and their motives. As a result he tend to introduce explanations - motives, parties etc - that is not the explanations of the text or the so called narrator. It would have been better if he had distinguished between the analysis of the text and his suggestions about ""what really happened""."
5,The best book ever written!,"I bought a copy of ""Looking for Alibrandi"" about a month ago, and I couldnt put it down once I started reading it. 17-year-old Josie Alibrandi and her friends Seraphina, Anna, Lee, John Barton, & Jacob Coote are all teenagers that you can relate to. They have their ups and downs, their good times, their bad times, and none of them are perfect...A sad, witty, and humorous book that is recommended to those who love a good read."
4,Looking For Alibrandi,"The book ""Looking for Alibrandi"" was a very good book. However, I think that the movie was much better. I think that Josiphine was a very confussed girl to begin with but near the end she finds out who she really is. She is an Italian in heart and an Australian in life but she doesn't care. I would reccomend this movie for an older audience because the younger people may not get the whole story line. I feel the same way about the book beacuse the are a few bad words and the kids shouldn't know them."
5,ALiBrAnDi MaNiA,"when i first heard of the book i wanted to get my hands straiht away. as i read the first page i was inspired by its passion and literature, i couldn't stop reading. the words just keep my going on. the book releates to how i coped with highschool, i faced many problems just like Josephine Alibrandi.i feel this book is fantastic and everyone SHOULD read it!"
4,An passionate glimse inside the heart of aust.mlticulturism,"Josie,an Italian Australian h.s.c.student allows the reader inside her feelings about australin life today in a mannor that informs,entertians and educates.An eye opening read,though breif,into the hardships of migrant acceptance into an australian cultue that today,is perhaps one of the most multicultured in the world"
4,Very informative aspect of the multiculture life in Australi,"I was instructed to read this book for school, but I got so invovedI never could write a proper report. It is an emotional book that tellsof Josie in her last year of school and the problems she perceives she has.The story tells of her struggles coming to grip these problems. It isa good read for teenagers."
4,Amazing,"A breathtaking depiction of the trials and angst of a multi-cultural teenager. Marchetta's writing is stark, humorous, vivid, touching and above all, real. Alibrandi comes to life in this book, a must read for all under 20's"
5,Best read/movie ever,"This is just a short review""Looking for Alibrandi"" was a sensational movie and even better book. I felt good al through this story as I can relate, being an adolescent myself. I would encorage every single person to read and watch this story, and If anyone knows a book simular to this story, could they please notify me at...Thankyou"
5,not my usual type of book,"I'm an avid reader, in fact, I read so much that my family actually grounds me from reading sometimes (though not very often because I'm not really a trouble-maker). I usually read science-fiction/fantasy type stuff, but my mom was really getting angry with me for never trying anything new that I finally picked this book up at my school library.I finished it in three hours. I went back, and I read it again. and again. this book was very inspiring to me because Josephine Alibrandi has a lot of the same ideals, and characteristics that I have. I learned a lot from her, and even though I still don't read a lot of books that aren't science-fiction/fantasy, this book remains one of my favorites. I encourage you to pick it up and read it, even if it doesn't look like the kind of thing that would interest you. you won't be dissapointed."
5,Loved it!,"Looking for Alibrandi is way better than ""Saving Fransesca"". The main character Josephine is so likeable and you can really relate to her in a way. This book is packed with drama. I read it in one day."
5,Sags Is The Best,"being the author of this novel, i feel that this story should have had a bit more suspense.."
5,Unbelievable School Book!,"I had to read this book a couple of years ago for school, it was on our booklist. It was the last book over the year we had to read and review in class so at the start of the year it sat in my locker gathering dust. Then school holidays came and I decided to read the book as the girl I sat next to in class said she read it and really liked it. Over the holidays I read it, (actually I read it in one day) and my eyes were all puffy and half closed the next by all the crying I did that night. It is a book I can relate to, and everyone else in the class did too, everyone loved the book. I'm sure if you read it, you will too."
3,It's Ok but it ain't great,"It was ok, easy to read, i only read it for English. But it ain't that great, it just tells every teenagers life in words on paper, we;re all different, you don't have to be an immigrant to be different or have an alcoholic father. Well written but still, it aint that great"
3,The story of Josephines life in Australia,"This novel, Looking for Alibrandi, tells the story of Josephine and her complicated life. I liked this book because of the relationship between Alibrandi, her father, and the other boys in her life. It was also interesting because the setting of the book is in Australia and you get to see the differences in life styles. I disliked this book because it didn't have enough action for my taste for one, and the second thing is because it was more of a girl book than a guy book. This book may not rank in my top list of all time favorites, but it was my favorite out of the three novels I have read this summer. I would recommend this particular story to a girl rather then a boy because it is about a girls life so a girl would probably like the book better; but it is still a pretty good book for anyone to read including a guy."
5,As Heavy As It Gets,"I was lucky enough to catch these guys at an outdoor concert in Olympia WA during the release of this fine piece of work. I watched dazed, pummeled and hypnotized as they slogged through a 30 minute version of 'Charmicarmacat' then ripped through their viking rocker 'Hog Leg' .Joe Preston blasted the audience with low frequency while Dale Grover drove the point home relentlessly beating his drums into submission. They finished up the grueling set with 'Wispy' and 'Antitoxidote'. I still don't know what hit me to this day. Buy this album."
1,This smells yucky,"This smells yucky and doesn't work, it's not what I was expecting. Not wax, more like goo."
5,Blessed Love !,This is a compilation of immense proportions IMMENSE I SAY ! Ya Mon the Crusaders are the Best !
5,Great addition,"Added this to my man cave, great addition! It helps complete my collection of John Deere Tin Signs!!!! Same approximate quality as other tins signs."
4,Very utile for me,"""A Short Course in International Contracts"" showed itself a very good help to beginning understand the 'Lex Mercatoria', in the following aspects: a- negociation e role of attorney; b- Incoterms and other trade terms and c- importance of knowing cultural differences around the world. As a law student, I've found the Mrs.Shippey's book a valious tool for my essay, which is necessary to graduation title."
2,Rubbish,"Shippey's books provides a fine summary of issues that one faces when drafting international contracts. However, her contract models are not practical and thorough. If you try to use this book to write your own contracts, you will get screwed."
3,Good for the price.,"I expected this tripod would be a bit more sturdy as I thought it was made of metal. It's my own fault, the description clearly states that it is a reinforced plastic. The secondary legs seem like they may break at some point, but maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. Overall, the UltraPod II is lightweight and versatile so it's a handy and inexpensive addition to your camera bag. I'll probably use it most to steady hand-held shots by using it on my chest."
5,Ideal for travel,"When I ordered this tripod, I though it would be flimsy, since it's made of plastic... but it is quite sturdy, actually. Get this one instead of the original Ultrapod, which is not as stable. I've used this with my Canon A75 and Canon A630, and I can put them in portrait mode without any problems. By the way, if you're going to use this on the floor, better get yourself a camera with a vari-angle LCD!It's quite a pity that this tripod is not available directly here. But you can do a web search to find it."
2,Too lightweight for SLR,"I bought this tripod for use with a Nikon D90 + kit lens or other lightweight lenses. The tripod itself is well made, and behaves as advertised. The size of this thing is great. However ...The tripod can hold camera/lens, but due to its flimsy construction, even minimal movements (such as mirror and shutter movements) result in unacceptble vibrations, even when the camera is triggered by remote control. The two situations where this tripod may still be useful for me are (1) taking very long exposures - shutter-induced vibrations may not play a significant role then, and (2) using the tripod velcroed to some other support - this may work, but I'm a bit worried about entrusting camera to the velcro.All in all - this tripod is not very useful for the type of camera I'm trying to use it for. It may be useful for significantly smaller cameras."
3,Perfect for a compact...not so for a DSLR.,"The Ultra Pod works really well with a smaller compact camera, and I would imagine that it would work fine with a typical superzoom, such as a Canon S5 or SX1. But when you get up to DSLRs or those monster fixed-lens cams like the Fuji, you're pushing it. It worked with my Pentax K-x...one of the smallest and (with kit 18-55 lens) lightest DSLRs. I wouldn't put anything more than that on it.The strap is a bit difficult to work with...I'd rather have the better strap that comes with the Ultra Pod Digital, but at 15 bucks, the Ultra Pod was a lot cheaper...and the strap does work just fine."
5,Use with Optoma ML500 projectors,"These are excellent tripods for use with the Optoma ML500 LED projectors. I purchased (2) and both work perfectly, fold up and store with the projectors."
4,Cheap light flimsy plastic -- works great!,"I don't know how long this thing will last, but it's very lightweight and has a clever tripod system where two legs retract into a larger third leg. The feet are grippy vinyl so you can put it on an angled surface without it going anywhere. The ball head is of course plastic within a clamp made of yet more plastic but is remarkably tight.I would not trust putting a heavy SLR on this but I've been putting a remote flash in it with no stability problems at all. It's a tremendous weight saver compared to my metal Manfrotto table tripod with a professional ball head.It's not quite a five star product. I'm skeptical of how long the construction will last and it costs at least five bucks more than it's worth."
3,Limited Use,This tripod is very nice for light weight cameras such as the point and shoot. My camera is a Nikon D300 with some heavy lens and did not work on this tripod due to the heavy weight. My daughter has a light weight camera and I gave it to her and she finds it to be just right for her use.
3,Very handy,"It seems to cost 2x what it is worth, but it is a great idea and is rather handy. more stable than a gorilla pod on the table, but not as versatile in the field. it is tiny enough for a cargo pants pocket."
1,Absolute Piece of Junk,"The reviewers who rate this thing highly are either crazy or paid by the manufacturer. The thing is totally flimsy, even with a lightweight camera on it like the Fuji X100. It is a joke. The ball head hardly qualifies as such, though it indeed has a ball. All in all, a rickety disappointment that qualifies for the trash can. There are much better alternatives if you are serious about your photography and willing to spend a little more. Do yourself a favor and forget this POS."
3,"OK for horizontal, not for vertical","I use a Canon XSi with 18-135, UV filter, and hood. For horizontal shots, this little tripod is great. Sets up quickly and light weight. However, there is some difficulty locking the ball head into position due to the weight of the camera and lens (about 2 pounds total). It's not just the weight, but the length of the lens that creates torque.For vertical shots, the weight is just too much and this tripod will NOT support the camera. It'll just twist till the camera points down. Even if it could hold the weight, it's still difficult to use in vertical orientation with an SLR due to the bulk of the camera and the ball head's proximity to the legs.It's better than nothing most of the time though, so it stays in my Lowepro backpack. Good value. Might try a Gorillapod though."
5,Great Product,It is exactly what I was looking for. I have already used it and plan to use it often. Very light and travels easily.
2,not so great,"I'm using this book in an introductory organic spectroscopy class, and have found it to be both mildly obscurantist and riddled with minor errors. There are (very) few worked examples in the text, and much of the exposition of process and technique would be enhanced by the inclusion of illustrative diagrams (which have frequently and inexplicably been left out in sections dealing with fairly complicated situations). Almost no physical explanations are given for the various spectral techniques and phenomenon covered in the book.All in all, a frustrating experience."
2,A so-so book...,"I took a class in organic spectroscopy this year (spring 1999) and this was the primary textbook. My professor skipped some of the chapters and handed out supplementary materials instead. I don't know what was the motive to choose it as a textbook, i guess because it covers all, although superficially. If you are looking for a book on the subject, I suggest finding a few older ones that concentrate on subjects instead of something that wants to be the Holy Grail of Spectroscopy."
5,"Hot Blues, Cool Cat","Randy will never be forgotten; it's albums like Invisible Society that will insure that. He had a way of making a crowd listen, move and feel the kinda Blues that make you wanna celebrate. Fans of the authentic South Texas ""sound"" will miss him. Rest in Peace, Chicano Blues Man.Cat"
4,The Wu shine in their second release!,"The Big Wu write ... good songs. This album is a showcase of those talents. I love all the songs... each one makes ya want to get up and dance. Great melodies. Some nice lyrics, and all done with a lilt and bounce that is only the Big Wu. Check it out!"
2,Big Disappointment in Folktales,"After hearing the Big Wu's first album, ""Tracking Buffalo through the Bathtub,"" I immediately sought out their other music. This being their latest studio CD, I expected a lot. The biggest problem I found was a lack of exciting or even catchy songs. And the playing isn't bad, just a little boring. Supposedly (source from Rhombus Web forums) the producer was going for a ""pop"" feel, which is accomplished in a polished sound. The problem is, by polishing away the instrumental sections in which the Wu excels, you place the burden on the songwriting. And to reiterate, the straight songs aren't bad, just a bit unexciting. To the album's credit, song 2, ""Minnesota Moon"" has a real swinging feel to it, which I really enjoy. I'd like to also add that in the context of the band's natural setting (a live performance) some of these songs such as ""Boxing Day"" are given new life. Still unless you're a die-hard Wu fan and have to own every CD, put this one at the end of your list."
2,Not Mickey Rourke's best work,"This was your typical B movie. This kind of work is to be expected by Rourke, but not from Applegate. Without out giving the whole movie away, I was very disappointed by the ending. Im not going to completely knock the movie, but it did not keep my interest, and it is not my type of movie. Maybe others will appreciate more than I did."
2,Not Bad....,"First of all I'd like to say this is not a great film It is a B movie but it is a very entertaining B movie. It is full of great performances Alexis Arquette has never been better. Scott Leet is perfect as Ray Frye The Convict who gets a second chance at life after spending seven years in the joint for Manslaughter . Now out of jail and back on the street Ray is looking to redeem himself somehow, while being endlessly hounded By Two cops (Mickey Rourke,Peter Green). Ray hooks up with Arquette who gives him a job and a place to live. There Ray meets and falls in love with Arquette's Lovely and lonely wife played by (Nina Ofenbok) Before you know it Ray is tangled in a web of murder and mystrey. They're are several Great Cameos, Ed Lauter , Christina Applegate And Balthazar Getty."
2,50/50,"This movie had some good acting, but pathetic directing. It is very low budget, and it plays to a tired theme...However, Mickey Rourke was very good.....and there were some cameos (which didn`t help much)..Scott Leet was trying too hard to be Clint Eastwood. I imagine Mickey did this movie as a favor to some friends.Interesting, but a bit of a failure."
3,Change the Title,"As a veteren cruiser myself I firmly disagree with the author's view of many of the cruise lines and ammenities listed and point out some examples where he was outright dishonest. For example when reviewing Carnival Cruise Lines food he described the coffee as rusty water served in paper cups. Carnival serves their hot beverages on deck and in the restaurants and buffets in ceramic cups with handles. Paper cups are available if desired. He also complained that Carnival does not have a selection of breads and cheeses yet at every dinner seating and on the buffet there was always a selection of bread and cheeses. From reading the book it sounds like the author would like to be pampered and catered to in a way not possible on a large cruise ship. Maybe the title of the book should be changed to ""Cruising for the Snobbish and Pompous!"""
5,Thorough and Succinct,Simply the best reference for learning about the cruise experience and comparing ships. Should be required reading for anyone contemplating a holiday on a cruise ship.
1,Don't Bother,"I repeatedly struggled with whether to keep reading this book. The characters are very shallow (perky women, mysterious men with deep dark pasts, teenagers who can't decide what they want, etc.) The main character sustains major injuries yet blows them off and flounces on. A huge storm threatens out to sea throughout the book, but never arrives. Paranoia reigns and people are not what they seem. Repeatedly someone walks in the door just as the main character thinks of them or wants to ask them a question.I never cared, and I finished the book with relief, and regret for wasted time."
4,Enjoyable,"I recommend for a quiet evening or Saturday. Fun with twists in the plot but not overly pretentious. I thought there were some gaps in the story line that could have been expanded, though these were filled in with thought."
4,Enjoyable and Interesting,Unhinged by Sarah GrahamWell written story located in Eastport Maine. Different twins with the home repair theme interwoven into the mystery.
4,A good lazy day read that captures the quirkiness of Maine,"Sarah Graves captures Downeast Maine! Her characters, while exaggerated, are spot on. This is one of the apsects of her books that I appreciate the most. She also describes the setting accurately, transporting the reader to the REAL Maine - not the Hollywood or imaginary one.The plot is a bit ""Murder She Wrote"" convenient, but maintains enough suspense to entertain.This addition to the ""Home Repair is Homicide"" series is another good, light read. Perfect for a rainy afternoon."
2,Not crazy about it,"I chose this rocker for my baby shower. It's a nice looking one, no crazy colors as the others (that's one of the main reasons I chose it). My son is not crazy about it. He keeps on sliding down on it, the vibration and the 3 attach toys does not calm my baby either. Save your money and buy something well worth it"
2,Needs Work,"The concept of this rocker/vibration chair makes sense. However, the vibration part broke after two weeks. I had to keep pressing the low/high buttons to turn it on even with a brand new battery. Sometimes, it wouldn't even start with a new battery. I think it would be perfect if they made the vibration more reliable. The rocker part is awesome. My first son had a bouncer, this time I have the rocking bottom and it is definetly a plus."
5,Talk about relaxation!!!!,I bought this for my sister in law and she loves it!!! It put both of her girls to sleep allowing her to get some rest too. She is on her 2nd girl right now and I couldn't agree on more on this being a must have for a new mommy!!!
2,Waste of money,I did not like this. I ended up giving it away. It was just nothing special. Plus it was awkward getting the baby in and out of it. The only thing I liked was the color.
3,This thing is unwearable,"There's 2 hooks with arrow like points on the back of the paddle that interlock with your belt,But unless you are wearing Kevlar trousers this thing become painful quick.Also they include a belt loop attachment that works well but then you have to take your belt on and off,also there's 2 draw adjusting bolts at the bottom,I sent mine back because I wanted an easy on easy off hostler for oc.I don't see anyone using this for cc because the hostler sticks out about an 1 inch from the belt mount.Looked like it was made to last,but forget the paddle,if you want a paddle go for a fobus that has padding for your hip instead of arrow hooks."
4,Uncle Mike's did it again!,"I recently bought this holster with thoughts in mind of how I wanted it to work for my gun. It stood up and exceeded my expectations! I would recommend this holster to any one who wants or needs a holster for a Walther P99 Compact. It's a great holster from Uncle Mike's.....great for any one, from civilians look for a slim holster to law enforcement looking for a holster for there service gun. Thanks again Uncle Mike's!!!"
4,Works for S&W M&P22,"I bought this holster for use with a S&W M&P22. I knew there was a possibility that the 22 could be slightly different in dimensions than the normal M&P as it is made by Walther in Germany vice S&W in the US. It seems to fit just fine. I've used it for plinking, drawing practice and USPSA style shooting. It is easier to put on and take off than another brand's holster, yet it stays in place just fine. I like it and recommend it."
2,Too Tight,This holster is supposed to fit a G-30. I loosen the tension screws until they were about to fall out and the gun will not go into the holster without pulling the slide back and out of battery. Maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting.
2,Ok practice holster not a concealed carry product.,Ok practice holster not a concealed carry product.Damaged finish on gun after only a few minutes of practice.
5,Super product,I purchased this holster to use at the range with my Ruger P-94. The holster is well constructed and fits on your hip just as it should. Easy to draw from and keeps pistol secure when transitioning between firing positions. Great purchase.
4,liked the product had to send it back,this product stood out too far from my body to be well concealed. had to send it back. it is a fine product wish i could of used it
2,"mainly, it's for the birds","The Birds enjoyed considerable success when it was first produced in the 1920s, but I'm guessing that was essentially due to the opera's built-in need for imaginative staging, as most of the characters are depicted as birds.Thus it is with this Los Angeles Opera production - clever costumes & sets supported by good singing from soloists & chorus.But The Birds must fly or flop by the quality of the music, & the music never really takes off, fluttering erratically from one style & mood to another. Braunfels evinces no stylistic voice of his own, & the score is a hodge-podge of echoes of other composers & even other centuries.Was it intended to be a serious symbolic drama? Or a semi-serious satire? Hard to tell, but should we care, one way or another? I think not."
4,Better Than Book 4,Queen Betsy. Need I say more? Well probably. I really enjoy these books. They are quick reads and I feel like I really know the characters. This book was better than the last and leads you to wonder what is in store for Betsy during the next book! Will she get married? Will she rule all the vamps forever? Glorious stories!
4,A good read,"Vampires, sex, love and danger. I have been reading this series and it just keeps getting better and better. You do need to start with book one as these books are a series and Betsy's story develops in each new book. If you like the Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris, you will love this."
2,The first 4 were a lot better,I haven't enjoyed book 5 very much. It feels as though the author lost her steam...the first 4 were great though!!!
3,It was okay,"Poor Bets, Queen of the Undead and anything but unpopular. As if planning an unnecessary wedding wasn't enough Bets has to deal with her step-mother the 'ANT' dropping by and leaving BabyJon for hours on end, and carelessly forgetting to pick him up.Unfortunately for Bets, that's just the tip of the iceberg in this book as a group of Ancient Vampires steal into town to show their 'respect' to the Queen. Unfortunately one of Bets subjects, and friends has a grudge against one of the Ancients who eventually turns up dead, and all is pointing to Sonya.While this book was mildly entertaining it was no where near as good as the previous books. The rip on herself, seems more like a pat on the back when she talks about Betsy's story being published as a 'joke'.I think for those who want to take a breather from serious titles, and read something quick this is the book for you."
2,Sort of brain candy...,"I always view MJD's books as brain candy. They are fun, short and effervescent with a simple plot. However this one fell short of even brain candy. I couldn't discern a recognizable plot in this story. I'm holding out for the next one."
2,Stunningly bad book.,"There is a fine line between witty, sexy and funny books and books that are so overloaded and busy in an attempt to be witty, sexy and funny that it all turns into gray mush. I have finally realized that every Mary Janice Davidson book is a crap shoot as to which side of that line she will land on. This book is mostly gray mush. It's busy, boring and because MJD never establishes a flow for the story, it's all very staccato. And Betsy is getting more bitchy and schizo and not-cute bratty. If you want to keep pace of things, buy a latte, curl up at Borders and read it right there. Trust me, once you're done, you're not going to want to take this one home for a reread."
1,SILLY,"This book is silly, juvenile and a ""writers"" excuse for coy self indulgence. The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting and the plot, what I could find of it, poorly constructed and badly executed. I was bored from page one and finished it only because I simply could not believe it would not get better (it certainly could not have gotten worse!). But (big surprise) it didn't! Although I bought it at a jumble sale for .50 cents I finished it feeling I had still overpaid! I suggest Tate Holloway. Her books are of the same genre` and actually fun to read."
4,Undead and Unpopular is just as good as the rest of the series,This author is so talented. She employs something so series like vampires with such comedic situations. This books is fun like the rest of the series. Can't wait to read the last two.
3,I'm not sure what the point was...,"Let me start by saying that I have read all of the books in this series and loved them. This one was short and didn't seem to advance the story much. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more to it. That said, I will definitely buy the next one."
1,What is this author smoking?,"I'm returning this book. The main character has become a BIMBO to the Nth power with no common sense. M.J. Davidson's writing is weak, underdeveloped characters, and reads like a diary of a 15 year old."
2,Losing that spark,"As another reviewer said, this book was very thin, in plot, in characters etc. Betsy is starting to become annoying, with her 'it's all about me' attitude. As for her being queen of the vampires-Why!!, she doesn't appear to be stronger(if anything she's weak and just mouths off alot-She's just plain rude to everyone.) When this series first started MJD said she was only going to do five books, maybe she should have stuck to that. I won't be buying anymore hardbacks that's for sure."
2,Disappointed,"I liked the previous books of the series, but this one was very disappointing. All the characters, including Betsy, were unsympathetic. The very short novel (novella?) rambled from one idea to another with no real plot. And WTF was the zombie all about?While there were a couple of amusing lines, I didn't find any laugh-out-loud moments. The smug mention of Undead and Unwed was annoying instead of clever.If you've read the other Undead books, by all means read this one. The next one might be novel length and focused. If not, the next one will be the last of the series for me."
2,Undead and unpopular,The book just wasn't up to standards of the others. It was ok but I would not save it to read again.
2,Good thing I got it at the library,"Okay, I'm a huge MJD fan, but. . .I would have been seriously pissed if I paid for the hardcover price, because it is. . .A short read without much depth or action. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in this book.What a waste of paper."
2,Boring & Confused,"So I am the typical MJD fan. Love everything the woman wrote UNTIL this book. Can't even call it a book. Just random thoughts and sentences someone out there edited into a book. Shame on that person! No shame on Maryjanice because I still love her. Everyone is entitled to a miss and this miss is huge. MJD can redeem herself by making this a ""set - up"" book and making this book pay off huge in her next ""Undead"" novel. Come on, MJD -- Betsy would throw her Prada Loafers at you for giving her fans this incomplete assignment the publishing company greedily bound into a hardcover. Then she, Laura and Jessica would calmly sit in Jessica's kitchen and make Mango Margaritas because we all know that Mango is the new Strawberry."
2,Undead and Unpopular Needs a Plot,I usually love MaryJanice but this book was seriously missing a plot. She left too many things unsolved. This felt more like a novella instead of a full novel. MJ please finish out these plot lines and stop dragging them along.
3,"YEAH, UHH, MAYBE BETSY SHOULD REALLY DIE","I think, no matter what Ms. Davidson titles her next book, I will refer to it as ""Undead and Unread""."
3,Where's the other half?,"I love MaryJanice's writing; it's hilarious, unexpected, and utterly delicious. I loved Undead and Unwed, Undead and Unappreciated, Undead and Unemployed, and Derrick's Bane. That being said this book could have been a novella for as much action as it had in it. It's really a set up for the next book. Do yourself a favor and either wait for the next one to come out, or buy one of the books mentioned above. This book was an incredible waste of my 22 bucks, and will be summed up in about a chapter's worth of words in the next book which is all it deserves."
1,Undead and Board,"I was really looking forward to this book comming out,i really wanted it to pull my attention back as i thought the last one was lacking something (a real Plot). All the right elements where going to be there, zombies, unknown european vampires, and a friend with a possible incurable illness. However the polt just did not deliver for me.Sorry MJD but you just aren`t grabbing my attention, and i loved the first three books.Betsy just seems to be going no where in the last two books, no character developement no suspence no anything. Lets have a few more pages for our money and lets see an enemy thats worth fighting , and lets have our Betsy do the fighting insted of some one else!!!"
2,Series takes a flop with this one,"This series was very enjoyable in the first couple of books, light-hearted, fun, and a quick read. Then, the publishers did what they frequently do: they figured if it was popular as a paperback original, now they could start it out as a hardcover and get more money. But this series just isn't hardcover material, folks, particularly in this outing. The story is so fleeting, there's just nothing to it. I agree with the poster who said it was more of a novellla than a novel. A dead (no pun intended) giveaway? A large type font and big white margins. Don't waste your money on this one, get it from the library."
1,Lost and Confused,"1st of all, I am a big fan of the Undead series so it hurts me to write this review. But it was horrible and confusing to read. There were so many characters from previous books and ones I have no clue where they came from that there was no depth into the main characters. Why bother writing about characters who have zero meaning to the story. The main storyline is a great idea but little was written about it and there was so much going on you never got a sense why the European vampires were there or if they hated Betsy so much that if they were going to kill her or accept her. The main character who was such a funny strong woman in the first three books has a major ego problem, self absurb, and too wise of a mouth that she can be quite annoying. I hope MJD's next Undead book gets more focused on 1 storyline and back on track to why people love the Betsy character so much. Otherwise, this series is dead to me.Finally, can someone explain the zombie in the attic?"
3,I'm Saving Judgment...,"Maybe I'm just burnt out on Betsy. Maybe it was the wrong time of the month to try and read UNDEAD AND UNPOPULAR. Maybe the full moon made my brain hurt. Regardless of the reason, I couldn't even finish this story, and that saddens me.I love MJD, I love her sense of humor, I love her writing style. I didn't love this book. It seemed to be missing that irreverent sense of witty snarkism that always make me enjoy an MJD story. There were plot lines that seemed totally unimportant (and, in fact, ridiculous) to the plot--can anyone say zombie in the attic?The fact is, sometimes the story was amusing. Sometimes I liked Betsy. Sometimes I thought Eric was still hot. Most of the time, though, I was simply bored and uninspired."
3,too short....is it worth reading?,"Yes it is, if you're following the story of Betsy our lovable ""Vampire Queen"". I enjoyed reading about Betsy and meeting the European faction of vamipres, her quest to plan a wedding and dealing with Jessica's sickness. My only problem is that the book is very short, and it reads more like a chapter than an independent book. I feel that MJD could wait in between books and put out a larger one vs. these smaller books. This book takes a couple of hours to read, and you almost forget what you read minutes later. If your a fan of MJD and Betsy, then yes you'll enjoy it, but the series is getting strained."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by this entry in Mary Janice Davidson's Undead series. Undead and Unpopular lacks any real tension. It suffers from too much exposition and dialog. They are talking in the kitchen. They are talking in the parlor. They are talking in the bedroom. There really didn't seem to be much actual action at all. The menace implied by the European vampires never really seemed all that menacing. When I got to the end of the book I had to go back and check. I couldn't find a real climax to any of the action. I think that's the point. The action in this book was sorely missing. Betsy's self-centered whining is starting to get old, and there seemed to be a chapter I missed somewhere along the line. Probably some short story in an anthology. I dislike when authors assume you'll read every anthology they contribute to."
2,Undead and No Plot.,"This book is an example of a publishing house capitalizing on MJD's fan base. Instead of making one larger book, with a true plot line rather than the meager substance in Undead and Unpopular, they put out this small book IN HARDBACK to get more money.I am strongly disappointed in this book, its almost as if MJD's notes were slopped together in hopes of a last minute book.I have enjoyed the previous books, but this one was severely lacking.The zombie thing was totally random, and unmemorable. I can only hope it is building toward something in the next book. The quick tie up of loose ends at the end of the book, left me apalled.Again, I can only hope that the next book will improve, and that the publishing houses will not worry so much about capitalizing on MJD's works and more about the quality of the book, and how many people will stop reading when the writing gets too bad or expensive."
3,Below Par,"The first few books in this series were brilliant, with wonderful characterizations and a dry wit that made the reader laugh out loud.Unfortunately, successive volumes have proven disappointing. From time to time, there are flashes of what made the first few books such great reads, but these glimmers are few and far between. It seems to me that Davidson is churning out several of these in a year, instead of taking the time to write one book really well, with a cohesive plot, in which something actually happens. This iteration seems more like the middle chapters of a book or a series of short stories than a complete novel.I'm still intrigued enough with Besty, Queen of the Vampires, and her court to continue to read these for now, but I hope that future volumes have more substance to them. In short, borrow this from the library, but don't waste money on a hardback."
2,undead & disjointed,"There were few plot revalations in this book, lots of random events that weren't tied together well, and not enough progression of character or plot to make it worth a full entry in the series. And worse, it wasn't that much fun to read (which is the whole point of these books). I hope the author takes a lot more time producing the next in the series (and that she jumps straight to the wedding, which at least promises some intrigue). I took it out of the library; if I had paid for the book, I probably would be entering a single star -- NOT worth the hardcover price at all!!!!"
5,A Wonderful Beach Book,Tired of serious topics and mind boggling text? Just looking for a nice entertaining fluff book? Like vampires and shoes? If so then this book is for you! It's a riot with fun characters and outrageous situations - the Queen of the Vampires name is Betsy for crying out loud. I had trouble putting it down. Absolutely hilarious!!
2,A Fabulous Somnolescent,"In case you aren't up on your medical/pharmacutical jargon, a somonlescent is a sleep-aid. I have read all of the books in the Undead series, and frankly this one is boring. I am not sure why she thought that the plot of this book was good, but I can assure you it is not. Better luck next time."
5,"So good, he's cutting into my sales...","This book is so good it hurts. I work with this guy and I can't believe he wrote it. I would have bought it, but they are laying around all over the place."
2,Sanctuary Sparrow Book,"Although I knew when I ordered the paperback book that it was not in the best of condition, I ordered it since I had trouble finding this particular book. The book was in worse condition that I understood it to be and now am looking for a better copy."
2,flimsy deck,"I purchased this item thinking that the deck was relatively the same feel as a regular tarot or playing card deck. The deck itself has an appearance of being flimsy and having a paperlike quality. Very hard to manipulate in a reading. However, the hardcover book is a wonderful reference manual to be added to my library. So if you are interested in reading about the origins of Russian Gypsy Fortune Telling Cards it might be worth buying."
4,Good parlor trick and evening entertainment,"The cards are truly beautiful in the way a mosaic pattern is created in the layout. The book is easy to understand and nicely packaged with the cards. I highly recommend this as a gift which is why I purchased the set. This is something to pull out after a nice dinner or later in the evening with a group of friends, enjoyably passing the time. Very entertaining.On the other hand, being a professional reader for many years, it would not be my subjective pick as an intuitive card tool, especially for a beginner learning to read for others. (And, if you are a true intuitive, you won't need cards at some point any way, other than for a very nice show.) If you are looking for Tarot deck, be a purist and go with the Rider-Waite (and/or derivative) or the Connelly deck."
1,Not for me!!!,"I was really looking forward to getting these cards - the concept seemed unique and fascinating. However, when I got them, I was very disappointed. There are too many gloom and doom cards (it would almost make you dread a reading) - and the explanations for the cards are very narrow as compared to tarot cards. There wasn't any room for interpretation, imagination, or getting that '6th sense' feel for the question you asked. If you love tarot because of the never-ending learning and twists and turns that comes with each reading, you won't like this method."
5,Easy to use,Easy to use and understand. Clear pictures and meanings are explained simply. Very happy with purchase. Would recommend if you are interested in using cards as a helping tool. Great fun at parties too.
2,Bought them for a friend,"My friend said they were okay but also said it was kinda like playing a game of Memory. She did not seem overly please witht he way the cards funstioned. The best part, she said, was the box and the design of the cards."
5,Lot of fun and sometihng new for Tarot fans,"A friend read these for me and I found them a lot of fun. And they still are!Truly unique in that you create pictures that face different directions. Each readis totally different. Makes for great party entertainment, though you may have to read aroundsome of the more traditional Russian meanings which sometimes lean in the more superstitious direction.Always popular with family and friends."
1,WHO?,Poor guy was brain dead his entire 2nd term and they make him out to be some sort of American Presidential hero. WHAT DID HE EVER DO?
3,it was good,This book was a text for a class I was taking on lineand was full of information and met my needs
3,Good book for Sacramental Basics,"The book is well written. However, the author leans a little on the modernist side. He calls into question the historicity of parts of Sacred Scripture which is contrary to the Catechism. If we can't rely on the Gospels being a historically accurate portrait of Christ, then what can we rely on?"
1,Quality below poor,I own a couple of the movie's that are included in this set which were brought separatily.These were recorded from old tapes or film reels (uncleaned) with continuous tracking line and graining. Not worth the money at any price. They are used the WOW factor to get your money.Buy the singles
3,Great B Horror movies for the price,"There is something about 60's -mid 80's budget horror films that you have to have a taste for to enjoy. For the price of this 10 movie set no one could complain, the best movie in the box is God told me to, but there are 8 out of the 10 that were worth watching."
4,Not bad though pricey,"This liner creates a very precise line that actually takes a little effort to glide. Guess that's the whole ""waterproof"" purpose because it feels like a sturdier wax-like substance not so easily melted or smudged which is good because it stays put & rich in color unlike other liners. I like that. It's pricier than most, but then again, it is Lancome so whattaya expect right? I doubt I'll repurchase due to the price & I like certain other liners better but this ain't bad."
2,It's not waterproof!,I purchased this item because i trust L'ancome very much but i was disappointed. This eyeliner is not waterproof at all.
4,Revved 10 Movie Pack,"This is a great box set with a lot of old forgotten movies, some good and okay movies. It was the perfect price for those movies."
4,"If it can reach out to me, it can reach out to you too.","Who would've thought that a band could take the last twenty minutes of Black Flag's ""My War"" and actually turn it into one behemoth, giant slab of noisy, slow, and effing heavy passage of metal bliss?If you're unfamiliar, here's all you really need to know:-At almost any pace, guitarist Buzzo can make one long journey of riffs worth more than one 20 second Steve Vai solo-if you find a huge problem about the lack of solos, then go back to listening to Malsteem, Petrucci, or which ever artists that makes a living masturbating in public-Dale Crover follows up with anything Buzzo makes up without wasting much time and without going over complex-Nirvana wishes to be like these guys but can't because he was too hopped up on medication to have the time to do soIt takes a while to actually finally get into it if you are new to sludge, but when you eventually do, it'll blow you away.8.5/10"
4,Very beautiful but a little on the large side,"I bought this bracelet as a gift for my mother. I couldn't really tell from the picture, but the crystals in the middle part of the bracelet are quite a bit larger than those at the ends. I wasn't wild about this, as my mother prefers more minimalist jewelry, but the bracelet is absolutely lovely and shines beautifully. I was almost sad to give it to her because I'd have to give up being able to look at it whenever I wanted.Very beautiful piece of jewelry - just be aware that it is a bit ""large"" and the middle is thicker than the ends."
4,"Good toddler book, sweet and educational","My 16-month-old son is intrigued by this book. He is still nursing, and he didn't realize that other animals nurse, too. It is a sweet, educational book that has become a bedtime favorite (followed by nightie nursing, of course).My one complaint: the illustrations, while colorful, lack detail. I would prefer that they show animal udders, etc. And the human baby on the last page appears to have a hunchback!"
3,"Review for ""We Like To Nurse""","A very sweet book, however I expected a bit more ""book"" for the price. It is a small, thin, paperback book. While I am always excited to see books that show/normalize breastfeeding, I would not recommend this book to others. Again, it's sweet but lacking sparkle and shine."
4,Daughter loves pictures,"My 11 month old loves to look at the animal pictures. It's in our ""line-up"" at bedtime and I enjoy reading to her how all the animals nurse. Then, it's our turn!"
4,we like to nurse,"A very cute book for teaching younger children how some other animals eat. Simple pictures, easy to understand. Arrived in good shape fairly quickly for a good price."
5,Incredibly sweet book,"I absolutely LOVE this book. It shows so many different animals nursing their little ones in such sweet pictures with such a sweet ending pic of a human baby nursing with mama. I will most definitely read this one to my little one over and over again, and hope that he learns to love it as one of his favorite books."
3,Classic,"I use another Bible in my everyday reading. There are times when something is lost in the translation and another version would bring the text into focus. This is how I use the GNT, and I use it quite often.I received this as a gift and I love it. In turn, I bought it as a gift."
2,Inferior dub,"In James Prideaux's THE LAST OF MRS. LINCOLN, produced and directed by George Schaefer for both Broadway and this 1976 PBS broadcast, Miss Harris reprises her Tony-winning performance as the troubled widow of America's 16th President. Vignettes from the final 17 sad years of Mary Todd Lincoln's life are shown.Also here from that original stageshow are Kate Wilkinson (as Mrs. McCullough) and Macon McCalman (W.H. Brady).This 1987 AVID brand VHS (listed here as a U.S.A. Video product) has HiFi audio but is recorded at LP speed. My copy has terrible tracking issues, so I've recently replaced it with a better quality SP transfer from KULTUR's Broadway Theatre Archive series.Click here for their tape of -->THE LAST OF MRS. LINCOLN.Also available onDVD."
3,"Ok, Overall","I really ordered this dvd for Dementia 13. Carnival of Souls is ok, but not great. Dementia 13 on the other hand still packs a punch. It's pretty creepy and would be a great to watch on Halloween night."
4,Interesting and highly readable,"Emsley is a chemist with writing abilities. He presents what could be dry, scientific material as interesting and fun to read. It's a quick read, yet full of information. I suspect he could have written a book of 500+ pages on the chemicals behind household (bleach), beauty (lipstick, wrinkle creams), health (Viagra, Prozac) and everyday items (chewing gum) we take for granted. I would have loved even more!"
4,Great Reading,"This is the third book that I've read by John Emsley. The author keeps the story moving by supporting statements within the text rather than distracting footnotes. Anyone interested in his daily exposure to the world of chemistry will enjoy this book. The book is not technical, but it is an excellent source of references should one want to dig deeper into any of the title topics."
1,"Small audience possible - Not scientific enough, and yet too much...","As an undergraduate chemist, I found that this book was far less technical than I'd hoped. It seems, however, that I am not above the level for which this text was intended. For example, any non-chemist will not care for the IUPAC names included, and may not have the scientific background that is assumed for some of the explanations. However, someone with a few years of chemistry studies under their belt will find this to be a gloss-over, and entirely unsatisfying. I have returned the item. I believe the small audience which may appreciate this could be a high-school student or freshman undergraduate with one to two semesters of chemistry tops. I believe, however, that someone without any background in chemistry or biochemistry will make little sense of this book at all. I cannot recommend this one."
3,cd did not play well,the cd stopped on several occassions. It took over 2 and one half hours to watch. It did have a great plot.
4,Good movie for anyone interested in the struggles of deaf people,"I ordered this movie for my wife's ASL class studies. At first I had no plan to watch the movie with her, since it was intended for a class project. From the first scene, I was immediately drawn into the story and interested in learning more about the struggles of the deaf. I think it is a good movie for anyone to watch. I have seen ""The Hammer"" wrestle in the UFC; learning more about his past makes his accomplishments that much more impressive."
3,The Hammer,Based on a true story about a deaf UFC wrestler. Received product in a timely manner. Decent production.A story of believing in one's self and a goal.
1,Poor Binding,"If you are considering this volume for its parallel Greek and English, then it is your only choice. I am not reviewing the Greek or English, as you know what you're in for with a Loeb. The one star is the result of a poorly produced volume. The newer Loeb volumes are very poorly bound. My copy of Nichomachean Ethics has a number of pages stuck together by binding glue to a point beyond the center margins and all the way into the text. Most new Loebs I've examined have this same problem, and I've seen them fall out of the binding in less than a semester of use. Older Loebs that I have seen in libraries seem to be bound much better, and I've known professors with Loeb volumes from the seventies that are holding up all right relative to their use and age. I'll avoid buying these new."
3,Cheap copy; overrated work,"I don't speak Greek so I can't comment on the accuracy of the translation, but it was reasonable English.You probably want precisely this text if you're looking at it, but if you're looking for personal enlightenment I'd recommend either Plato (I found Plato's Republic much superior in terms of the philosophy) or one of Aristotle's other works -- I haven't read them, but the philosophical discussion here is so relatively poor that I can only presume his fame comes from his mathematical lectures.The book itself is very cheaply made; it feels possible to just flip the spine over on itself (although actually doing this would probably send a number of pages flying)."
1,a waste of money,"I did not get this book from Amazon knowing that I was about to read what ends up as a piece of evangelistic propaganda. Such as it is, its author seems to be narrowly educated, glowing with blind enthusiam, and speedily skips over deeply problematic religious questions I doubt he has the capacity to understand. I am surprised that Hampton Roads publishes such twaddle these days. Too bad for them. Had I browsed this book in a bookstore, I would not have bought it."
5,Really Good Vest!!!!!,"Buy this Vest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is a really good, heavy douty vest. it's really nice because it has a pistol holster on it and it can store lots of clips for that pistol or your main wep. it also has a butt pad on it for those hard stocks on those rifles. i roccomend this vest highly, and it's inexpensive. A MUST!!!!!!!!!!"
4,sweet vest,"i really liked this vest theres a few problems with it though.theres alot of pockets on it but they are all pretty much just to small i couldnt fit anything in them. all i could fit in it was my pistal. i couldnt fit my main mag. or any of my pistol mags. this is a good vest besides that. and it kinda fits baggy on me. i had to do a little magic with the scissors and fix a few things but other than that, a real good durable vest."
3,Had to make adjustments...,"After reading the other reviews of this product, I was convinced to purchase this online. I received this almost a month ago and was disappointed that it was a little tight for me. I am 6' - 250lbs and the size was just exact for my built but not enough space for other clothings (winter or other outdoor shirts). Since there is a 20% restocking fee if I return it to the seller, I just decided to bring it to my tailor and have the belts on the sides adjusted by 5 inches more for $15. Beware of the restocking fee!The mag pouches are just enough for my 556 pmags and the pistol holster is just what I need.I would recommend this as a good buy just because it has all the pockets that you will need and it will serve its purpose."
3,Good gear,"Fair gear for the average airsofter, even stood up to some real world Tactical training but not for hard usage."
4,Good starter chest rig.,"This is a very nice chest rig, however if you are a smaller person, (I'm only 5'7"", btw) it's a little big, if you don't adjust it. I had to tighten all the straps all the way and it's still just a little big. But overall it's a good rig."
4,frickin awesomesauce!,"this vest is really cool! its a little tight around my waist but i think thats from me being a little on the chunky side. also a better pic would have helped greatly so i could see its mesh. nevertheless, i really likeit"
3,Great style,"Vest style is great as it adjusts for my husband who is 6'4"" and my son who is 4'10"". The biggest downfall is the vest smelled horribly of gasoline or oil products. We left it outside on the deck for a week to get most of the smell out. It still has a faint smell but much better than before"
3,Airsoft vest,"Over all Ok product. Plenty of mag pouches. Pistol holster removes from Velcro but cannot be adjusted or the repositioned. The shoulder adjustment velcro releases very easy, it could use some reinforcement."
5,Good buy.,"For the money, this is going to be a great tactical vest for whatever your needs are. I don't airsoft but I imagine it would be great for that too, I actually bought this for a Halloween costume. Anyways I am a large man, 6'3 215lbs and didn't have an issue getting it to fit me. Anyways, great for the price and very sturdy."
1,Not good...,"Needed some gear for shooting a movie. This looked perfect so I decided to order it and try it out. It fit, however, the material is VERY fragile (as in, tears VERY easily). 6' 3"", broad shoulder here, as I sid it fit, it's just not made well otherwise. I ended up haing to order another vest from elsewhere."
1,my brothers gone,"this was a very bad vest, it shipped and fell apart when i took it out of the box my mental brother tryed it on and shot him self repeatidley until he had to be sent to ER!"
4,Not What I Expected,"Not what I expected from Ken Tamplin. The more I listened to it, the more I like it. Very good acoustic rock songs."
3,Necklace,"Good quality materials. The gold doesn't stand out against the silver as much as I had hoped, but still satisfied with the purchase."
1,WARNING !!!,"Yes this blanket is very cuddly.It also bled dye all over our white leather couch.So we're not psyched about that.We're washing our blankets now, maybe that'll help.Don't let this happen to your couch !!"
4,A Mostly Good Effort,"Overall, this CD is solid, with a few rough spots. It starts off with the energetic ""Silcanturnitova"" and the first five songs are all interesting and varied. After track 5, the excellent ""Puerto Rico"", the CD's first and biggest blemish comes up. ""Pinnacle"" has the feel of a song that was thrown together last minute to put a tenth song on the CD. It suffers from incredibly trite lyrics and a fairly uninteresting melody. ""Gimme a Raise"" has the same lyrical problems, but manages to make itself halfway decent via its rockin' bluesy feel.This CD is worth the money, all in all, but has a couple of down spots. I find this to be a great road trip CD, which requires only the one press of the Skip button."
5,a very good aid to understanding Statistical Physics.,"I recommend this book to any one interested in the subject. Wannier really pulls of a understandable approach to Statistical physics. You do need the proper backround, and a williness to read it. Otherwise it is very good."
2,"Move on friend, there is nothing but sorrow here","I was looking for something beyond an undergraduate treatment when I came upon this book, and thought that for ... dollars, it was a good deal. The table of contents is really impressive, but reading the book is a horror. If you've taught a course in statistical mechanics, it is probably okay as a reference, but otherwise stay away!"
5,Great people to order from.,"Needed the D for a couple of Wet Willie songs. The Harp sounds great of course, it's a Hohner! The Harp was here in no time, Thank you Red Bone!"
5,Add this book to your library,"This is a very good book to read on shotguns and shooting. Mr. McIntosh is an excellent writer. His style of mixing technique with short stories and antidotes made for a pleasant, educational and entertaining read. Add this book to your library."
1,Uncertain,Not sure how to review as I never received the product. First off the product delivery time was approx. one month. After the month was up I requested info on when could I expect the product be delivered. I immediately received a response indicating that I would receive a refund and that sometimes the Postal service loses things. While I appreciate the refund I would hardly call this a satisfactory buying experience.
2,seems like a bait and switch to me,"If you don't read the reviews beforehand you may be sorely disappointed with this video, as I was. It shows a young Steve on the cover and doesn't mention when it was recorded, only when it was released. What's inside is a different story. The band sounds great, but alas, our poor Steve's voice is a mere shadow of what it was with SF and HP. It sounds weak and forced and there is no attempt to ""shout"" anymore - he only seems to reach for the easy notes. I thought from the photo it would be recordings from 10 years earlier. It's too expensive for what you're getting..."
3,Review from a 1 hour one way Commuter.,"I listen to this package while I commute. This is a good package. It is well organized and the comments prior to the books are very informative and helpful. My main issue is with the narrator. His speed is not consistent. At times I feel he is rushed and at other times he is fine. I find his rush distracting to focus on the content of the book. For this reason I bought another version from another store. The version is called ""La Biblia de las Americas Nuevo Testamento en CD."" It is narrated by Samuel Montoya who does an excellent job narrating. AMAZON should offer this version."
2,Why the music,"There is this sappy music in the background. Not only is the music unnecessary, it is distracting."
2,Zondervan can do better,"The narrator speaks too quickly, without any feeling for the material, and doesn't have a pleasing voice. I find it very difficult to listen to."
2,I didn't find it believable or interesting.,"I wanted to like this book -- I really did! I have enjoyed other of Marge Piercy's books and thought I would like this one, since it was highly praised. But I found it implausible. The title character is a woman who sleeps her way through the ""underground"" without much thought or even gender preference affecting her choices. Call me crazy, but if I thought the whole world could turn on me at a moment's notice, I wouldn't make myself vulnerable to that many people by sleeping with all of them. Vida appears to be dedicated to something, but what that something is, is never made clear. The ""cause"" she is committee to is never specified and seems to vary depending on who she is hanging around with. I didn't find the main character likable nor could I understand her motives. Guess I was born too late to understand the ""radicals"" of the 1960s! Give this one a pass unless you are someone who has fond memories of flower power and free love."
1,Cheap Junk,Had a hard time getting the SD card in the reader and thenit still wouldn't read the card. Then was fearfulI'd damage my SD card getting it out because it wasstuck so tight I had to use pliers to get it out.
3,An Average book on the Messier Objects,"O'Meara is torn between making this an observing guide (with useful finder charts, drawings and descriptions) and a cloudy nights armchair book (with scientific information, excellent photographs, and historical data). He includes a little of each, but not enough of either, for me to recommend the book unless you simply want to own every book on the subject matter.The seminal work on the subject, with far more information and better charts, is Kenneth Glyn Jones' 1968 book, ""Messier's Nebulae & Star Clusters"" (revised 1991). O'Meara's book is a very pale shadow of Glyn Jones' book, but I give it 3 stars for effort and because it may be easier to find.But you will be well rewarded to find Glyn Jones' book or the wonderful ""The Messier Album"" by Mallas and Kreimer."
3,"Good, detailed look at all Messier objects","This is a useful reference and particularly good for people who prefer detailed observation of objects. For people like me who prefer quantity over quality (i.e. if you don't spend an hour looking at the same object), I'd recommend Kepple's Night Sky Observers guide. Kepple's guides offer a combination of the most useful and comprehensive guides I've seen for intermediate and advanced observational astronomers.The hardback format of this book isn't particularly good for the field, even though I've seen people referencing beaten-up copies with their red flashlights. It has good quality paper stock.In sum, this is a standard work on the Messier objects and has substantial value despite its somewhat high price. However, I could think of other books I'd buy first -- Nightwatch for beginners, Kepple's set for more advanced users."
5,Terrific assistance for small telescopes,"Most problems amateurs have with the Messier objects is a) finding them, and b) once they ""think"" they have found it, knowing what it ""should"" look like, and c) once they do actually have it, knowing and understanding what they are looking at. This book really helps with (b) and (c). A Telrad bullseye would have helped with (a), but one can't have everything. This is a great, easy-to-read and use companion for anyone who likes looking for the deep-sky objects."
4,Just what I needed to get me going,"After buying 4 other books on astronomy and hoping for one that would get a new astronomer such as myself past looking at the moon and planets. This book did the trick. I found over 20 messier objects the first night with just this book and a star chart to guide me. The illustrations and drawings along with his description of how to find the objects put me on the money to objects that are not visible to the naked eye. The back cover is a quick star chart too. Comes in handy when your away from your table. I gave it 4 stars because it is a hard back book. It would have been perfect if he had taken the ""Nightwatch"" example and made it a spiral bound to lay flat."
4,Messier viewing with a distinctly artistic flavour,This book is an interesting change from the stereo-typcial astronomy guide which so often tends to be technical to the point of dryness. O'Meara lets fly with some artistic hyperbolae and isn't afraid to let the imagination loose. The result is a refreshingly different perspective on sky viewing. His descriptions of the Messier objects have caused me to look differntly at what I thought were familiar friends until now. The book is best appreciated if delved into - trying to read it cover to cover is not recommended.
4,Raw,You should not start here if you do not own their studio albums. For those of us who know their works this is a great chance to hear them in a complete live enviroment. This is the trio playing some songs i had not heard before. Others are familiar but changed (re-arranged). Recommended!
3,Be Careful!,"On my copies, Messiah of Evil, Die, Sister Die!, and Lady Frankenstein are not complete. They abruptly stop mid-way through. The best were Sisters of Death and The Werewolf and the Vampire Woman."
1,These movies i would recommend if you can not sleep.,Can't sleep? Tell your doctor to prescribe Ambien but if you can't afford that then these set of movies just might do the trick if not faster. Don't waste your time or money on this.
3,The Leper King and his Heirs : Baldwin IV and the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem,"This was a very informative book. However, contrary to what the title would lead you to believe, the Leper King and His Heirs provides very little actual material about King Baldwin IV. However, the events that occured after his death are covered in great detail and I would still recommend this title for anyone doing academic research on the Crusades (or who just enjoy reading about historical events). Well written and very detailed."
2,ZZZZZZ.....,"There's no doubt that this is an extremely well-researched book, and very informative about the political developments in the Levant post-Baldwin, but it is light on Baldwin himself and endlessly boring. I understand that we're a bit into the weeds on Crusader history for most, but even for someone like me that has a genuine enthusiasm for the subject matter, this book is a drag, and is obviously written for a purely scholarly audience. It is not readable, or accessible as other reviewers have claimed (who are these people?), and certainly not for general enthusiasts or casual readers, rather this book is more in the vein of a thesis paper, and best suited for those who are already very familiar with the arcane political nuances of the period."
3,KIERKEGAARD'S LIFE,"Alastair HannayKierkegaard, A Biography(Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001) 496 pages(ISBN: 0-512-56077-2; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: B4376.H36 2001)Alastair Hannay is a long-time scholarand translator of Kierkegaard's works.He puts his deep understanding of SKinto this comprehensive story of SK's life.References is made to the writing and publishing of each book,but Hannay do not concentrate on the content of SK's thoughtas much as on the events of his life and relationships.I recommend reading this biography alongsideSren Kierkegaard: Papers and Journals: A Selection,which is organized chronologically---selected and translated by Alastair Hannay.James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
4,The Cattle King's Mistress by Emma Darcy (Large Print Harlequin),"The 'Kings of the Outback' series by Emma Darcy is made up of three novels: The Cattle King's Mistress, The Playboy King's Wife, and The Pleasure King's Bride. This story is the first in the 'Kings' trilogy.Description from the book back cover:Nathan King, powerful head of his legendary family's cattle empire has everything - except a woman to share his life. Miranda Wade has nothing - except a past she is determined to leave behind, and the hope that her new job at King's Eden will give her a fresh start. Their two lives collide! Nathan wants her, but doubts she will cope with outback life. Miranda wants him, but believes her past will deny her any chance at a future with a King ...Kings Of The Outback - Three masterful brothers and the women who tame them."
4,Nice collection but not the very best,"This CD listed the most popular of Bach's work but not consider ""The Best"" but it is the most suitable material for people who is new to classical music and new to Bach and his work. 4 out of 5 stars."
4,Kids bible dvd,"great videos for all ages, I gained new insights from watching. Transaction time was awesome, arrived even faster then projected and kids could watch it easter Sunday. Thanks"
4,Banjo Magic,Best way to learn to play the banjo. This one was cheaper so I bought it first. So good I asked for Volume #1 for Christmas.
3,"Two Classics, sadly mangled","I was thrilled to receive these two old favorites for Christmas. Then, I watched them. For A Muppet Family Christmas, the video has been remastered and the picture is quite clear, but there are HUGE edits, entire scenes cut out, that not only remove the best part of the show, but make the whole experience choppy (see other reviews under ""A Muppet Family Christmas"" sold separately).Emmet Otter is, as near as I remember, fully intact, but the audio remastering has left the lyrics during the musical numbers nearly impossible to discern, even if you know them by heart.If you've got either of these taped off of TV from some time in the past, I would encourage you to borrow a second VCR and record them over onto a fresh tape to last you another 15 or so years. Maybe they'll have brought out a good version of these shows by then."
3,Well - are the deleted scenes back in or not???,"One review says that the deleted scenes have been put back into the Muppet Family Christmas. I would certainly buy this movie, but only if that were the case. But then I read another review that says that scenes have still been cut. I noticed that the length of the movie is still the same (42 mins.) and thus I tend to think that the the deleted scenes were not restored. If the scenes have been restored, my review would be 5 stars!!!"
4,decent stand for the $,"The stand itself is very well built. A few things to watch out for though,,,assemble with hand screwdriver because the screwholes seem like they would strip easy....not packed well seeing how the top is metal and slides around inside during shipping,put a ding in 1 of my uprights...wish I could of got it in a taller model because it`s a little short for floorstanding mains..."
5,Weiss and Hickman are excellent world builders,"This review is for the entire series. The story ia about a furure human world that is divided into humans, elves and dwarfs. There are two waring races of super humans called Sartans and Patryns. The Sartans imprison the Patryns in a horrible Laberynth. The Sartans then divide the world into four forms. The story centers on Haplo , who was sent by his master to find out about these four worlds and to seek revenge on the Sartans. In Dragon Wing he visits the first world that consists of floating Islands. In the first four books of the series Haplo goes to each of the four worlds. The final three books basically close out the series.The death gate cycle is a very and complex fanatasy series about Humans, Elves and Dwarves as they fight to restore thier world."
4,Great beginning to the Death Gate Cycle,"Dragon Wing is a great introduction to the Death Gate Cycle. Maragaret Weis and Tracy Hickman to world building to a whole new level when they wrote the Death Gate Cycle. They have demonstrated their sheer imagination and skill as they wrote this book. The book starts off slow but that is only because you have not become acquainted with everything yet. There was an interesting array of characters in which they all had complex and unusual backgrounds. The setting of the book was the most unique part of the book.The stage is set on the floating islands of the world Arianus. The climax of the book was a major disappointment, but the following books more than make up for this let down. If you like the Dragonlance Saga then this is more than worth your while to read!"
5,Warning - Addicting,"What an awesome start to a great series of books! I read the Cycle when I was a teen and loved it and now in my....Early 20's ;) I wonder how I waited so long before picking it up again. From this first book, 'Dragon Wing' through the seventh I was hooked and still am!"
5,Best Series of Fantasy Books Ever!,"This is the best series of books. Since I have started reading Dragon Wing, I havn't been able to put these books down. I've never read a book so fast as the I read the books in the Death Gate Cycle. The way they develop the characters is ingenius, as soon as you think you have someone all figured out, something dramatic happens and your view of them completely cchanges. So many times in this series, I have said to myself, ""This is impossible, there's no way to get out of this situation."" But they always manage to surprise you and keep you hanging. The only bad thing about these books is that you will get considerably less sleep, spend all your money, and want to buy every single book ever written by these two authors. BUY THIS BOOK. Everyone deserves a chance to see what classic writing is at its best."
5,"Slow beginning, worth every moment.","This book starts out a little slow, and may not hold your attention, but I suggest sticking with it and continuing on with the rest of the series... It is truly an excellent series and after the middle of book 2, i couldn't put it down."
4,Good Book!,"When I bought this book, it was because I had nothing else, and this was a desparate plea for entertainment. The beginning was slow at first, but I believe in the long run it was necessary in order to develope a steady plot and setting. Not the best book I've read, but that is just because my favorite books are some of the other Death Gate novels. In other words; read this book, because by the end of the Seventh book, you're going to be VERY pleased!"
5,Dragonlance is junk compared to Death Gate.,"This is truly Weis and Hickman's greatest achievment .It is even better than Dragonlance ,and that is saying something.There is much more intrigue ,much more uncertanity ,much more character description.I was also pleased by there extensive detail in the dwarves ,or Gegs .Barely any authors put that much detail in dwarves ,they usually stick to the elves.But anyway ,here is the plot :The world has been sundered into four realms ,sky ,stone ,fire and water .On Arianus ,Sky realm ,Three things are happening at once :Hugh the assasin is hired against his will to kill a prince .Sinistrad the wizard is planning to conquer Arianus .Limbeck the dwarf has challenged the beliefs of his people and has decided to lead them in regellion against the ""Welves "".Any fantasy fan should read this ,and continue the series .I began the second book several days ago and it's even better ."
4,Beginning of an Intresting new series.,"This is the first book of a seven book series, collectively reffered to as the ""Death Gate Cycle"". Like other works by these two authors, ""Dragon Wing"" does not disappoint as it is filled with wonderous landscapes and memorable characters. ""Dragon Wing"" is full of plot twists, action and a sprinkling of comic situations. The book does a great job of raising questions as to what has happened to the world (it seems that the world has been seperated into different Elemental realms of Air, Fire, Stone and Water) and for what purpose was this done.All in all, this was an enjoyable book and deffinetly worth giving it try."
4,A good beginning for a series...,"Although not one of the best books I've read, it still peaked my interest enough to read the next installment in the series. It had a strong background and plot that hopefully will lead to a more riveting tale about this world and the conflict of Sartan vs. Patryn."
1,Try another format.,"As you have seen with others, the Kindle version is rife with typographical errors. About location 200, and I am done with it. A few errors are expected but ""ar rows"", really? The fantasy names have been swapped back and forth a few times as well, so if you are a new reader (as I am, and - being the first book- you would expect others to be) you are left going ""wait, what is this place called?"". I can't review the books content as the technology has ruined it, in this case. Save yourself some frustration and pick up the paperback or something."
3,Run-of-the-mill story and world,"The idea of a world sundered by ancient wizards into floating islands makes me think of the excellent ""Shattered World"" by Michael Reave, a wonderful novel that presents an interesting world with true depth. In Dragon Wing, Arianus, the realm of air, has a superficial feel to it. Occasionally, random facts are presented in footnotes but the history and culture feels empty and artificial. The plot takes a long time to develop, the dialogue of the characters is stilted, and the authors seem unable to hold a consistent tension."
3,Worth reading when you have nothing to do,Dragon wing was by far not the best book I've read but the six following were wonderful!
4,Really a masterpiece one shall not miss,"I'm slow in reading. I have only read just over one chapter. But even that, the beginning of the story is already attractive. The story is well-planned and unexpected to me. I can't wait too long to see what would happen in the rest of the book to come. To be frank, I'm quite sure I will buy the rest of the volumes."
3,Great Worldbuilding,"The characters and plot don't offer anything much to speak of, but the world is a joy. The authors have taken established archetypes and introduced them in delightfully unique ways. I'll keep reading the series, just to see what they've done with the world in the next installment - and that's saying something for me, since, usually, character is the end-all be-all."
2,"Novel good, Editing Bad","The editing of the Kindle Book version of this novel is atrocious. The conversion from a physical book to an electronic one obviously didn't go well and a number of words that the author uses frequently are constantly misspelled (clark is dark) in the kindle format. The same goes for a good bit of punctuation where i's and exclamations frequently end up as italicized slashes. If you've read the book before, you'll likely pick up on issues quickly and be able to substitute as you read, but if you haven't you may be confused by terminology ""changes"" that happen sometimes even in the same paragraph.Its painful to believe that the publishing company (Spectra) didn't even bother having someone read the Kindle version before sticking it up on the Amazon store."
2,"There are better fantasy titles available, do not waste your","I am a huge fan of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, and have read their other books. DragonLance (AWESOME), DarkSword (NO) and DeathGate (NO).This is a seven book set and if you can think the first books in this series are good then you may like them all. I thought this book (and the rest) were not even close to the stories of Dragonlance, and read all the books in this series thinking the story would get better. My friend also is a big fan of DragonLance and the LOTR an he agreed this series was a BIG disappointment.Read this book if you want, but don't blame me when you finish all seven and go..what a waste of my time, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman went from telling possibly the greatest story with the Dragonlance series to having writers block and producing seven volumes of blah!!"
1,This book is boring!,"This book is very boring. The characters are mildly interesting but there is very little development of the characters. Very bland. The book takes over 300 pages before anything gets interesting. I do give it credit for being different from your standard fantasy but it just doesn't have good content to keep one interested. Reading never felt like such a chore before this book. A word of warning as you go through these reviews, beware that some reviewers have given away some spoilers without warning. Read these reviews with caution if you do not want the ending of this book ruined for you."
1,Come on--,"You've got to be kidding me. I read this book twice. Once as a teenager, and once as an older man. This is the worst kind of fantasy. To see this book recieving such acclaim on this website shows that Amazon has a definite interest in the success of these authors. This book was entertaining to me as a child, but a complete failure to me as an adult. There is no depth, no character development, practically no plot to this text. This is simply mass production at its best. Give a semi-original name to a type-cast character, place him in a standard situation, and add colorful adjectives to make the story interesting. There is nothing new here. Weiss and Hickman are competent authors of children's fantasy, just keep them out of my section."
1,totally boring !!!!!,"This book has to be the worst fantasy I have ever read. At first I thought that the action would pick up eventually, but after I got half way through it I knew that I made a mistake. This whole book was about politics, I don't know about you, but if I'm going to read a book about politics it is not going to be about a situation that doesn't really affect me. I don't even think there was one GOOD battle scene."
1,Skip it,"Wow. I was amazed at how much my friends enjoyed this book. Actually, most of my friends liked the series as a whole more than this one book. I liked the whole series also, but the first book was not even worth reading. As one of my good friends put it, this book was just a set-up for the rest of the sequels. As advice to soon-to-be readers, skip Dragon Wing and start with the book Elven Star, the second book in the series. It was much more entertaining, and didn't even have the same characters as in Dragon Wing, so you will have not missed much."
1,Typo Wing,"Like other people have posted, the Kindle version is full of very distracting typos. If the Kindle is meant to help immerse people in their reading, more quality control should be exercised on the content to keep it from negatively affecting that result."
3,Hard slogging...,"However good the plot, the character development, the overall theme of the series, kindle version of this book, at least, is *full* of typos and other character recognition errors. Before I reached chapter 5 I was tempted to toss the book. Reader beware - you may want to invest in a printed copy."
3,"Great Series, poor Kindle Version","Personally, I really enjoyed reading through all the books in this series when my dad let me borrow them. Since then, I've re-read them a few times, and I thought I'd get the kindle version for ease of read on the go. This is the reason why I've given this story 3 stars. It doesn't deserve it for content, but it certainly deserves it for the formatting errors that LITTER the kindle edition.Like others, I'm surprised the kindle version wasn't proof-read before release. And if it's claimed that it was, it's a blatant lie as the mistakes are obvious."
5,Great!,"One of my favorite hohner harps for cross harp. This thing plays like a dream. What a quality product, as are all Special 20's"
1,two many mistakes,"i bought this as a christmas gift. it came dented and the socket that hold the bulb crushed. the company sent me another one, but different color. It arrived completley liquidless. Not an ounce to be found since the glass broke in transit. i was offered to either send them both back for a refund or keep them both for 40% of what I paid. The company was relatively prompt in response, but product reliability was subpar."
1,Broken,"I ordered this item as a gift and it doesn't work. My younger brother has tried several times plugging lamp in and leaving on to warm up however it doesn't work. The wax is just clumped together in one large mass, never heats up enough where it bubbles apart correctly. Not sure if it has to do with the shipping (labeled fragile however we know nobody pays attention to that). Unable to return it because I lost the reciept."
3,Six Characters In search of an Author,"The play has much more potentials than this performance. Although it has been written about a century ago, the play's style is more advance than it time. This advancement of the style must be preserved in any modern production of the play. I would take the play into an open space and bring out the characters from the ""street"" crowd."
4,An excellent resource of tips & techniques for restoring,"While titled as a manul for Ford trucks from 1947 to 1967, I found this book so filled with helpful advice, and practical tips and techniques, that it is worthy of being in any auto restorers library. I do have an old Ford truck that I will be doing, and I am sure the advice I have already received from a cursory review of this book will save me hundreds of times the cost of the book. If you are new to restoring old cars or trucks, this book will go a long way to helping you get started."
3,Every Aspect in Detail? NOT,"This books description on the rear cover and in the publishers description indicates that ""every aspect of restoring a 1946-1967 Ford pickup is covered in detailed text that's full of how-to advice from expert restorers"". I can only say I think NOT. This IS a good book, with lot's of good GENERAL info, and lot's of good advice, and I'm sure most of the contributors are experts in some or all stages of restoration, but this book covers every aspect of restoring not one of the model years listed, LEAST of which is the 1965 and later models. This particular period (67) is exactly what I was looking for info on. I found that this book covered many general areas of the type/style equipment found on the models of truck listed, and had picktures of many of the models listed, but had specific info about almost NONE of the models listed."
5,"Detail, Lots of good detail","This book covers the restoration process for beginning to end... Inclusive of what type of restoration project you want to do, either complete restoration or just a get'er running restoration.Details are nice. Instruction is great."
1,How to Restore a Ford Pickup,"Need better description of contents of book.I have a 1931 Ford pickup that has been partially restored. I would like more technical information on further restoration, repairs and maintenance.From: allenrawl@earthlink.net"
2,disappointing...,"I agree with the last reviewer on all points. This book is quite disappointing. The content is superb but the presentation is horrendous. The publisher did a very poor job. Ringbinder is bulky, impossible to open quickly and flip through pages, pages are too thin, and font is ridiculously small. There are large portions of the pages left blank for ""note taking"" but ink bleeds through the ""tissue paper"" pages (You're lucky if you don't poke a hole through it first with the tip of the pen). The favorable reviews sound like suck ups. I give it 5 stars for excellent content, but subtract 3 stars for lack of usability in the real world"
2,FONT TOO SMALL,"Pocket Medicine has useful information but the font is way too small. I appreciate that it is light in a white coat, but reading the tiny font gives me a headache. There is space in the margins so a larger font could have been used. The book needs to be reformatted to deliver the same information in a readable font. I also agree with other reviewers that $32 is too much."
2,Mislead...,"I was mislead into purchasing the wrong version. It had either the ""Harrad Experiment (edited version)"" alone or you could purchase the ""Boy in the Plastick Bubble/Harrad Experiment 1976."" So, of course I thought this was the 1976 unedited version of the Harrad Experiment. WRONG. The 1976 was for the Boy in the Plastic Bubble only. the Harrad Experiment was 1973. I didn't even want the Boy in the Plastic Bubble.Oh, and by the way, it says unclut version for the Harrad Experiment on the back of the DVD once I got it, yet there is very obvious cuts, and of course no nudity. That is because it is the 1973 uncut version, which didn't have nudity in it.Live and learn. [...] I had always been happy with them up to this.I do have to say though that the movie was interesting. I'm glad I have it. I just wish I had the true unedited/uncut version."
1,No more censorship please,"When I first viewed the film ""Harrad Experiment"" it was on VHS, the not censored version. This is kind of an underground film, typical of the 70s.But beware, that version is cut. The film is most notoriously known for its nude scenes of actors now quite known (Don Johnson and Gregory Harrison, among others). That version contains absolutely NO nude scenes."
2,Bait and switch,"I just purchased this DVD set and expected the original uncut version of the 1973 Harrad Experiment. It is not what you get. It is more like the R-rated version, 90 minutes long, and no frontal nudity. I have the original uncut version on VHS tape from Wizard Video and it is 95 minutes. About the only thing that was uncensored about this tape is the language."
2,Exchange policy,"I wrote Marengo Films as suggested below to exchange my copy. This was their response:""We decided because we are a family oriented company not to put out the XXX version. If you have the other cover then we will gladly exchange your copy with our current update... which does have SOME very brief nudity.""So there you have it. Still not the uncut version."
1,it is still cut,"Bought this on 18th June 2005, with the idea of getting an uncut version of the Harrad Experiment, but it was cut and has no nudity in it at all..."
3,Loss and Redemption in Heroville,"Soledad O'Roark, mutant-hating and hunting police officer returns for more adventures in the Los Angeles area after the demise of the Age of Heroes.The brief attempts at rationaling Soledad's anger and hatred, while pointing out other's racism and hatred, are very weak and actually detract from the moral so perfectly illustrated in the first novel of Matthew chapter 7, verse 3:""And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?""Ridley follows the noir formula to its bitter end of conflicted and compromised characters attempting to survive in a dark and diseased world of stark whites and blacks, but mostly a morass of troubling moral choices. And in the end, all are self-damned."
4,Super Reader,"Soledad, or 'Bullet' is no longer the new kid on the block. In fact, she is in charge of an MTac unit. The new chick this time is Eddi Aoki, who wants to be Soledad when she grows up.Howeve, she has a thing for a great big knife that she inherited, as opposed to guns. Getting that close to super powered individuals is a lot of people's definition of crazy.Eddi gets to be like Soledad a lot sooner than she wanted to."
1,What is going on?,"All the avid fans of Cornwell's wait a year in-between books because of the wonderful story lines, great detail, and spine tingling thrills. This is the biggest disappointment of the year. Where is Scarpetta? This book is lame, boring, and drags on until you want to end up throwing the book out the window. From the remedial conversations between underwater sea life and idiotic police officers you will have a hard time getting through this one. Bring back Scarpetta and the quality of books we are use to."
3,Not As Bad As They Say,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and I can say that, while this isn't her best, it's not as bad as other reviewers have said.It is a dark, funny book. Once I got over the fact that it wasn't Cornwell's normal style, I really enjoyed it.Read it for fun, not as a critique on the writer."
1,Truly dreadful,"I made the mistake of spending 7 pounds on this in a bookstore in London so that I'd have something to read on a ten hour flight. What a mistake! I read the whole thing since I didn't have anything else with me, and it didn't get funny, believeable or interesting even at the end. Since the other reviews here did a fairly good job of describing the book, I won't go into all the details, except to add that I was surprised that in this day and age any publisher would publish a book that relied partly on black dialect, in the vein of Amos and Andy, for humor. Cornwall also ridicules poor rural whites for more ""comic"" relief. I've liked some of Cornwall's other books, but this is very different, and just plain stupid, not to mention offensive."
1,Unbelievable,"A few pages into this book and I had the sensation of turning into Alice and slipping into Wonderland! The inhabitants of a small island off the coast of Virginia are purported to be the descendants of immigrants from the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London, way back in the 17th century, and have intermarried to such an extent that they virtually have their own language (backwards speak) and the kinds of problems that accompany inbreeding.One can only assume that M/s Cornwall was imbibing some kind of strange substance while writing this book..don't touch it !"
1,Ugh...,I am hoping that a character in this book is dreaming all this because it is just so bad. People just aren't that stupid and crabs and dogs aren't that smart.
1,If only I had known,"Is Isle of Dogs a bad book, no not really, but I do feel some what betrayed, after reading Southern Cross and Hornets Nest I was expecting another novel along the same line. I thought that having the same characters, well almost all of them anyway, that the book would be in the same genre. Alas it wasn't. I wish I had known this before I bought it. I usually read a Cornwell book in 2 days, this book I have owned for 3 months and have yet to finish it, it remains on the shelf in my toilet."
1,Disappointing Book,"I loved the early Patrica Cornwell books. I looked forward to each new one. Perhaps she is running out of steam. Perhaps she was under pressure to produce. Regardless of the circumstances, the Isle of DoGs is disappointing. Save your money and go to the libary if you feel compelled to read it. It appears that Cornwell tried a ""light hearted"" approach to this book. The humor is heavy handed and produces more grimaces than smiles. If the author was not Patricia Cornwell, this book would not have been published. Let's hope her next book returns to her earlier high stnadards."
1,If you read this book .. it is time you will never get back!,"This book is terrible. Don't waste your time cracking it open. The worst part is that it is boring. After you get past that, the characters are paper thin, the humor mundane and the plot dull and plodding. I am also surprised that Cornwell, as a lesbian, would have such a level of homophobia in her novel."
1,Garbage,"I own (in hardback) every book she's written. After struggling to make myself read this for two months, I have given up. This book is not in any way humourous. It is just a waste of time, effort and money. I am sure I will ever be able to purchase another Cornwell book."
1,"Whatever she was going for, she missed","You've got crabs that talk to trout about why the driver of a car doesn't have a GPS unit and a dog that types on the computer. Unfortunately, the animals are much more intelligent than the human inhabitants of Richmond. At the end of this rambling attempt at humor, I knew no more about any character other than most of them, while they can't pronounce even the most common words correctly, are all computer literate. I'm glad this wasn't Patricia Cornwell's first book or no one would ever have heard of her and we would have missed some great fiction. Not everyone can write humor and that's the best lesson here."
1,i want my money back,"This has to be one of the worst books i ever read. I have alwaysliked her Kay Scarpetta books but this was just an attempt to make money or something. How I got through it, I'll never know.If anyone wants to read it, you can have mine for nothing."
1,Not a typical Cornwell novel would be an understatement,"Usually I finish one of Cornwell's novels within a day and it requires all my willpower to not finish it within one sitting. Not the case with this one. I am left wondering where the plot is headed with every page and what I am supposed to be laughing at if this is in fact a comedy. The switch between blind govenors and angelic serial murderers has me wondering whether it is worth finishing or not. But still, I trudge though hoping to find a glimmer of what I find in her previous work. I definetly DO NOT recommend it."
1,Unfortunate!,"This book is a dud for this reader. Other works by Cromwell are executed with terrific insight and research, but IF this was an attempt at humor it is a serious disappointment!"
1,FOR the dogs...,"Although Kay Scarpetta does make a cameo appearance, this story is not up to the typical high quality and intrigue we've come to expect from Patricia Cornwell. In fact, in places it is just plain bizarre (Talking trout? Jumping crabs? And those endless essays!) Patricia, what were you thinking??!?Even Michelle Hall's 5 star reading (including her interpretation of the fictitious Tangerian dialect) isn't enough to dredge this one out of the cellar!"
1,How disappointing!,"I am a fan of the Kay Scarpetta stories. I loved the suspense and the ""I can't put this book down"" feeling! But this time, I have this ""I can't read another page of this terribly bad book"" feeling. I had the hardest time to finish Southern Cross and it is the same with this book. Do not buy it! It will be a waste of your time and money."
2,Not Her Style -- and it Shows,"Patricia Cornwell is an undisputed master of the crime/mystery genre; her Kay Scarpetta series in particular is wonderfully executed. In ""Isle of Dogs"" Cornwell tries her hand at the dark comedy genre, in the vein of Carl Hiassen, and does okay, but no more. Perhaps Lloyd Bentsen would say to Cornwell, ""You're no Carl Hiassen"" and he would be right. Some gifted mystery writers can change genres (such as John Gisham and David Baldacci) but Cornwell seems to be trying too hard to be funny. It just does not really work. The reader is mildly entertained -- Cornwell does write well, and is easy to follow -- but ultimately we just do not care that much. So this reader requests: go back to what you do best!"
1,Patricia - How could you??,"I have read a number of Patricia Cornwell's books. I find them interestng and usually real ""page-turners"".As I read this one however, I was more and more disappointed. I managed to trudge forward thinking it would get better, after all this was Patricia Cornwell. Finally, when the trout and crabs were having a discussion in the trunk of the car I was rolling my eyes. But, when a protaganist began to talk like a pirate (it was genetic you see).... AAARGH... I could go no further. My book went in the trash... Sorry Patricia. I couldn't, in good conscience, even give it away."
1,Do not waste your time reading this book!,"This was described as being some sort of black comedy. Unfortunately, there was no humor beyond what a third grader could think up. Not clever, not funny, not ironic - just stupid. I regret spending the time to finish this book.I have read plenty of her Scarpetta novels, so I would not have guessed that this turgid mess was what awaited me. I agree with another reviewer who said that if this book were written by anyone other than Cornwell it would never have been published. Having just suffered through 'Port Mortuary', I am afraid that Cornwell may be becoming incapable of writing another good book."
1,So glad I borrowed this from the library,"Stupid, pathetic and not even remotely funny , ironic or satirical. I think Patricia C lent her good name to someone else's writing. I would give this zero stars if I could. I finished it only in the remote hope that it would suddenly miraculously improve"
2,What happened?,"I am an avid Patricia Cornwell fan, have read every Scarpetta novel and absolutely loved first two Andy Brazil novels, but what the heck? I have been trying to read this book for over two months and have had to make myself sit down and read just the first half. I am only half way through the book and am wondering what happened to Virginia West? The only reason I am going to finish the book is to see if her absence is explained. I hope that when I get to the end of the book, I won't feel like I have just wasted two days of my life."
1,Just plain absurd,What a waste of time. The characters are ludicrous. The plot non-existant. Don't bother with this one.
1,I was robbed!,That's the way I felt as I finally stopped trying to read this book - robbed. The money spent on the book was totally down the drain.
1,What a disappointment,"I'm a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell, but this book was the biggest waste of time, mine and hers! I kept expecting the foolishness to end and for Scarpetta to arrive to save the day....and it just never happened. Hopefully this group of characters are forever stranded on Tangier island and won't be re-appearing."
3,From the Real Tangier Island,"To A reader from Washburn, ME - Tangier Island is a real place and not an ivention of Patricia Cornwall's imagination and I resent being referred to as a ""hick""."
4,Love it!,"Come on, People...this is a funny, funny book. What's wrong with Blue Crabs having intelligent conversations? And computer literate dogs? Life would be pretty boring without a little whimsy now and then. Sometimes I worry about Ms. Cornwell delving into such dark areas with Kay Scarpetta. Glad to know she's got a touch of the crazies like me. Let yourself go and laugh right out loud with Isle of DoGs."
3,I placed my rating in the middle.,"This is not fair to Patricia Cornwell since I was not able to get into her book....and that is my problem not the author's. I didn't read very far into it before I stopped. I just don't ""get it"". I think in time that I will finish this book but not at present.After all, I have read and enjoyed all of her mystery books, including ""Portrait of a Killer""."
1,Major disappointment!,"Other than the names of two characters, there is no resemblance to any of Ms. Cornwell's books that I have read.Until now, I have been a fan - always eager to read her new novels as they emerge. However this is a disaster and I am throwing it out after only reading the first 1/4 of the book."
1,Who did she see as her audience?,"Once I start a book, I finish it. That is the only reason I finished this. I kept wondering who she thought her audience was. Teens? Pre-teens? Or did she think that she had an adult audience that liked spoofs of government and history? It certainly was not written for thinking readers of good detective fiction. Having read all of her older, good material, at least my reading this has saved me from wasting time on any more of her novels. I would have rated this book as a half point if that choice had been available."
1,A 1- because there is no Zero!,"Patricia Cornwell has certainly had many story ideas, this 'novel' is many story ideas loosely thread together. Characters are introduced and then not developed. The 'plot' is not comic it is insultingly absurd. It reads as if it were written by a group of Jr. High students taking turns at alternating paragraphs. I finished it just to see if it could possibly be redeemed.It couldn't. It wasn't worth the time, money or effort.This is my first negative review ever but I had to....It is the most ghastly drivel I have ever suffered.Jim Dennis"
2,hard read,I made myself finish this book even though it was very hard to follow the story line. In the end I found myself seeing a movie develop before my eyes. It would make a great slapstick comedy. Anyone out there want to write the screen play?? This was my first Patricia Cornwell and may well be my last. We'll see.....
1,Surprisingly awful attempt at humour,"I love reading Cornwell's books but I was shocked at Isle of Dogs. It was terrible. I was so surprised that Cornwell would write such an awful, unsuccessful book attempting to be funny. All it was ---was stupid and a bit trite. What a waste of exceptional writing talent !"
1,Terrible,"Avoid this book at all costs. I am a Cornwell and Scarpetta fan but this book was awful. It took me over three months to finish it and that was a huge task to just keep reading a page or two a day. I am not one to not finish a book that I have started but this was one I definatly did not want to finish. It was her worst ever book.Ms. Cornwell, what were you thinking???"
1,What an experiment !,"I first took notice of Patricia Cornwell with Hornet's nest.I have read them all. I could not set them down and the 'Last Presinct' was masterful. Alas, I set down Isle of Dogs many times .I only managed to get it finished on holidays as I had nothing left to read. Please Patricia, take a good holiday, and get back Kay Scarpetta to her former glory. We, your loyal fans deserve better."
2,Tough selling postmodern lit to die-hard Scarpetta fans...,"If ever there was a reason for an author to use a pseudonym, this book is it! While her earlier Hammer/Brazil books were different from Scarpetta, they were accessible to fans.Somewhere there is a readership for this kitschy blend. Postmodern literature, the ""no-rules genre"", the gritty parody of contemporary social commentary and fanciful historical invention, sells widely internationally.How easy it would have been to publish under another name and then let it be known that this was another face of a well-known author. It would have seemed less a betrayal to her fans."
1,What was she thinking?,"I am a huge Cornwell fan. I have read every book that has Kay Scarpetta in it. From Postmortem which had me walking around my house making sure that my windows and doors were locked. I can never wait for a new Patricia Cornwell book to come out. I got this book as a present and was so excited until I opened the book. Every attempt that she has made to write a book that doesn't have Dr. Scarpetta in them are terrible. I was getting my car fixed and sat at the dealership for 4 hours and couldn't even get through the first chapter. I thought maybe I just wasn't in the mood to read so I picked it up again, another day. Nope the book is just horrible. The charcaters are boring, the plot is boring, the whole thing is boring. Well I am guessing the whole thing is boring. I hope she goes back to Kay and Lucy and Pete I miss them. It didn't even deserve the 1 star that it made me rate it."
1,Not Worth the Time or Effort to Read,"I kept thinking the writing was going to get better...it didn't. As a native Richmonder I always find it interesting to read about the places I know, but even that aspect couldn't keep me interesting. Not worth the paper used to print."
1,"Unfortunately, I cannot rate any lower than 1 star!","Since I spend 2-3 hours a day driving, I've become an avid audio book listener. I love Ms. Cornwell and have actually read all of her books (just a couple on audio). This is just such drivil that I am beside myself. Thank goodness I did not buy this, I was able to borrow it from a friend who got it for Christmas. I'm half way through it, and am seriously considering taking the tapes and soaking them in a bowl of soapy water to spare my friend from the torture of listening to it (as of yet, he has not)."
1,was she kidding?,I think that I sprained my optic nerve rolling my eyes so much while reading this book! I am convinced that this was a high school assignment of Ms. Cornwell's that was published to meet a quota. I would have rather spent the time it took to read this book at the dentist.
1,A waste of time and money,"My son and I travel 150 miles two times per week for some reading assistance he needs. We almost always listen to audio books. We have listened to hundreds of books and I have to say that this is the first time we have both agreed to eject it and throw it away. Believe me, we have listened to some less than great books by some poor authors, but nothing this bad. We made it to the point where the crabs and fish were talking and that was the straw that broke the books back (re:wendy breeze).It is possible that it was less tolerable because it was audio..."
1,Isle Of Dogs,"I have read every single Patricia Cornwell's book. However, I am sad to say that the ""Isle of Dogs"" is a huge disappointment. The plot is scattered and boring. It is hard to believe that Patricia Cornwell actually wrote this book!"
1,Book for the dog to chew on,"I have been a Patricia Cornwall fan and have bought every one of her books --in hardcover no less --- I think I should have double my money back for this clunker. It's stupd, sophmoric, boring, unbelievable ..the adjectives are endless ...this book is just bad, bad, bad."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I was not put off by the fact that this was a Cornwell book without Kay Scarpetta as I enjoyed Southern Cross very much. I wasn't ready for such a poorly written effort with not a single likable character! Even Kay Scarpetta, in a cameo appearance, comes off cold and one-dimensional. I cannot improve on the comments in the other reviews in this section, only add my own warning- If you haven't already spent your money on this dreck, save it!"
1,Isle of Dogs,"Am a long time fan of Patricia Cornwell, but this book stinks! It seems to go all over the place without ever arriving. Surprised that this talented writer produced this book! It could have been good, but the humor falls flat."
2,More of a slapstick,"This was my first taste of Patricia Cornwell's writing. Quite naturally, I embarked on the book with an open mind, free of the high expectations or deep prejudices that often tend to color a fan's opinion. Despite all attempts to make it a dizzying comedy, it remains only an attempt at being funny. Save for a few situations that genuinely evoke laughter, most of the book can be read with a straight face."
1,Isle of Dogs,"I have read most of Cornwell's works and this by far is the weakest. While she is a great author in my opinion she is NOT a comedic author. I usually have trouble putting her books down, I had to force myself to pick this one up. I was always hoping that the story would pick up at some time. It did not.I bought the book on the strength of her past works and I was totally dissappointed."
1,A painful read,"When I purchased this book, I thought it would be another Patricia Cornwell thriller. I really enjoy page-turners similar to the ones she writes. It took me a few chapters to realize this was supposed to be some sort of comedy. Unfortunately, it wasn't funny. When I got to the talking crabs, I couldn't take it any more. The only other book I had to stop reading half way through was Yogi Berra's autobiography ""It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over,"" which was totally incomprehensible (just like this one)...."
1,What a disappointment,"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for longer than I can remember. I love to listen to her on tape during my long commute every morning and night, anxious to solve the mystery that is always presented in such a unique way. What happened? Did another author write this book? This book was so weird and so unbelievably terrible that I can't imagine Patricia Cornwell would want to put her name on it. Don't read it."
3,Confused and Dissapointed,"While I sometimes found this book amusing, it was not worth the money I paid for it in hardcover. It did not keep me in suspense and I find it hard to laugh when the humor shares the same page as serious brutality. This latest work by Patricia Cornwell left me confused and dissapointed."
1,Isle of Dogs,I love Patricia Cornwell and its hard for me to believe that she wrote this book...is the worst of her books.
1,What was she thinking?,This is one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read. It seems as if Ms Cornwall had prepared outlines for 3-4 books and then ran out of time so just amalgamated them all together to produce a total mess. In some parts it is a history of Jamestown and surrounding islands. In others the characters are poor attempts at the Carl Hiassen genre of weirdos. Then we have a bit of Stephen King type supernatural influence. Surrounding this are the previously enjoyable characters of Hammer and Brazil. I have been a fan of Ms Cornwall since the beginning but this time I think I should ask for a refund. This is not a book that is worth buying.
1,Beware of Dog,"If you're looking for a good mystery story - this isn't it. The biggest mystery here is how this book ever made it to print.Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books over the years, I was anxiously awaiting this new release. As usual, I started it as soon as it arrived, but soon found myself having to re-read the first chapter after having realized that it wasn't a dream sequence or being narrated by some psychopath. After I had endured nearly half of the book, a morbid sense of curiosity as to how bad it could get, compelled me to finish it. Believe me, this curiosity was not disappointed. The plot actually was not that bad, unfortunately it was the lack of support by the characters, situations, dialogue, etc. that ruined this story.In closing, if you enjoy finishing a book with the desire to read the next in the series, not the desire to send the author a bill for time ill spent, stay off the ""Ilse of Dogs"".MDS"
1,Infantile humour,"I like Cammy Diaz's review but I hated this book. It was painfully boring, slow to start, slow in the middle, slow to end. The attempt at humour wouldn't even have made a 4-year-old laugh.A couple of the positive reviews attempt to portray this as a continuation of the Judy Hammer, Andy Brazil series. What a crock! Hammer has about 4 paragraphs in the entire novel and Brazil's character has no reasonable relation to anything in the previous books. Something like ""find and replace"" seems to have been used to change to the main character names so this book could be falsely advertised.It seems very much like Cornwell had been doing some recent research into Virginian history and wanted to find some way of incorporating it into a novel. The end result is the book is interspersed with childish monographs that fall as flat as the infantile humour of the entire novel.A hugely disappointing waste of time and I really tried to give this novel a chance."
1,Has she seen her neurologist?,"This book represents such a total departure from Cornwell's previous books that it makes me wonder if she has had a stroke or a brain tumor. Has anyone noticed a drastic personality change?I finished listening to the entire book looking for some redeeming value, some reason for it's existance. I failed to find it. The situations are unbelievable, and just barely funny. What is she trying to say?This book would never have been printed if the author was an unknown."
1,This book deserves NO stars!,"I have read ALL Patricia Cornwell books before this one. I liked the author enough to get on the list for hard covers at my bookstore. I only do that with one other author. I will be hard pressed to pay the price for another Cornwell before reading the reviews. And then I will wait for the paperback from now on. This book deserves only two letters....PU! Yes, I too prefer Kay but Judy Hammer was OK until now. If I was the Gov. of Virginia, I would sue! Perhaps ""Popeye"" wrote the book while he was being held hostage. One thing for sure though,is that he does not write well. If someone will pay the postage I will give them the book."
1,What was she thinking?,"I've read all other Cornwell books, but couldn't make it all the way through this one.I could never relate to any of the characters and the history lesson was boring.I just don't get it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!,"Patricia, what happened? I have been a fan of all your books for years and cannot believe how awful this book turned out. If you're trying to emulate Hiaasen,then don't try again!!! You failed miserably and let down your loyal fans. This plot has no suspense, no ""what's going to happen on the next page?--I can't stop reading now"" feeling to it. I am so glad I checked it out from the library and didn't spend my own money on it.Buyers: If you're thinking of this book as a Xmas gift, get them a fruit cake instead!"
1,Just awful.,"What the hell was that? I don't think I'm as well read as many here, so I don't know many of these authors being referred to, but to me it felt like a very poor attempt at writing like Dickens. It had the quirky characters, the serendipitous meetings of the characters throughout the book, the bringing together the characters at the end of the book, and even a character that makes some odd noise every time he speaks. (The pilot who always says ""woo"".) If that was the attempt, it failed miserably. In fact, whatever the attempt, it failed miserably. I don't care how stupid Windy is supposed to be, nobody gets every metaphor incorrect. It's not funny. And how the hell did Trooper Truth get so popular? How did anyone know to look for it on the internet, and if they happened to stumble across it, why would they ever read the idiocy twice? I could go on forever, but I'll spare you."
1,"bad, bad, bad","I used to like her books. I also like Carl Hiassen's books.This one isn't near Hiassen. I had to stop reading it after page 85 - this is trash. How could this book ever become #1 New York Bestseller? It must be the pull of the authors name. Don't spend your time or money on this book. It doesn't even deserve 1 star, it's a turkey."
1,Surprising Disappointment,"After reading almost all of Patricia Cornwell's other novels, I was sorely disappointed in this one. Slow, tedious... and talking sea creatures just didn't cut it. I was hoping that Andy Brazil would do us all a favor and off Regina Crimm! At least that would have been exciting."
1,Loyal midwesterner,"I am a loyal Cornwell reader. I was so dissappointed in this book. I kept thinking ""where did that come from?"" There were characters and storylines that were promising but didn't go anywhere. I had a difficult time making myself get to the end. I was glad to throw it away."
1,"Isle of Dogs, hardcover","I am so disappointed in Cornwell's latest novel. Her characters of Hammer and Brazil are great additions, but they are wasted in this novel. It is a juvenile and uncomfortable read. Talking fish, crabs, dogs, and Crimm's ""submarine"" are just a few of the ridiculous subjects that Cornwell offers her savy readers? What was she thinking and what a shame! For those of us who purchase and read all of Cornwell's books, this was indeed a loser. Patricia, please don't go there again and disappoint your faithful readers."
1,Agree with the others,"We, too, have read all of Cornwell's novels (and would buy a new Scarpetta volume in a heartbeat). This is at least the second of the Police Chief Plays House novels I have read--and the last to be sure. The first was mildly amusing--but this was an embarassment to an accomplished novelist like Cornwell. Just why she--and her editors--thought it was worth the time and effort I fail to understand. Cornwell is, in this sense, writing as two separate persons, one who understands mystery writing and one who fails to understand either humorous writing OR police procedurals. Ed McBain-meets-Rita Mae Brown and her cat...."
1,Use the pages to line the kennel!!,What an insult to my intelligence! Possibly the worst book that I've ever read. I struggled through as much of it as I could stomach and then made the wise choice to throw it aside.
1,ISLE OF DOGS lives up to it name,"As an avid Patricia Cornwell fan, I am exceeding disappointed. This book is dull. Cornwell's last three books have been steadily going to, dare one say, the dogs. This one has arrived at the stated destination.It seems Ms. Cornwell has taken herself and her academic posturings to the limit; one is not reading her materials to be educated by someone who with so few historical/linguistic credentials.One positive note: I totally agree with her position regarding the 'politically correct' Pilgrim conspiracy--Virgina WAS first permanent English settlement in New World."
1,"Too bad, So sad","As many others, I felt this book was a real waste of time. I love Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta character and adventures. I couldn't finish this one and I am usually compulsive about finishing books. It wasn't funny, nor interesting. JayW"
1,Possibly the worst thing to come from her pen/computer,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and always enjoyed them, but this was awful. The story jumps around so much I kept wondering if she was under the influence of some mind-altering substance while she wrote. Trying to write from the perspective of the family pets and of the crabs that are supposed to be cooked for dinner does not help at all. I'm sorry I spent the money on this one."
1,Dog is right.,"Dog is certainly appropriate in the title of this book. I had read all of Cornwall's up to this one. I forced myself to get about a quarter of the way through, but that was it. I couldn't bear to continue. What Cornwall does well, she does well. Unfortunately, this attempt at comedy does not do well. It's been a very long time since I have been unable to finish a book, especially one from an author I otherwise like. Don't make my mistake and buy this book because of your familiarity with the author. It truly is a ""Dog."""
1,Isle of Dogs,"If you are looking for a page turner this is not it! I slogged through this book wondering the whole time why Patricia Cornwell decided to publish such tripe. I was very disappointed in the characters, who all seemed phony, and the plot which was ridiculous! It has made me very skeptical of ever buying another book authored by her."
1,Worst book ever written? Perhaps,"I am (or rather, was) a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell. This book is garbage! I had to force myself to keep reading, but after 110 pages I gave up in disgust."
1,Terrible,I've read all of the books by Patricia Cornwell. She has been one of my most favorite authors. I have enjoyed all of her books up until this one. This is by far the worst book I've ever read.
2,disappointed,"Her work is usually so much better, I had to force myself to finish the book. It jumped around too much,Have read better"
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I have read every Patricia Cornwell book to date. I have done everything that I possibly can to get to page 200 of this book, and I'm going to have to put down. This is not the Cornwell I know. Actually, regardless of who the author is, it isn't enough to keep one's interest. I'll pass and wait patiently on the next one!"
1,disappointing,"Like most of the reviews posted here, I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't really like her first Judy Hammer book, but decided to give Ms. Cornwell another chance. I thought perhaps I was just prejudiced because I enjoyed Kay Scarpetta so much! That was not the case. This simply was not a well-written book with dull, boring characters......Come on Patricia, we KNOW how good a writer you are....give us another good one!!! (p.s. Scarpetta or not....)"
1,BAD!,"Wow, is this book bad! It may be the worst book I've ever read. I'm a long time fan of Conrnwell so I'm very surprised. I thought that perhaps this was actually a joke. I always finish what I start but I just can't take any more. This is going in the trash. When the the blue shell crab and the trout started discussing GPS systems - that was it for me. It was bad enough when she wrote what the dogs were thinking, but crabs talking about GPS! BAD."
1,Disappointment,"What a major deviation from Cromwell's usual good work. Where was/is her thinking? Or did someone else actually do the writing this time? If so, then Cromwell should sue for defamation of her normally great character in the world of writing. This book was beyond silly and disappointing, it was a ""dupe"" to those loyal readers who have supported her work by (automatically) buying her latest book. I certainly will no longer buy as soon as one of her works comes hot off the press; instead, I will wait and see what others are saying, first, in their reviews.Come on Cromwell, get back in the groove please."
1,"If I could give fewer than 1 star, I would","I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell from the very beginning, and have rarely been disappointed. Isle of Dogs,however, was a major let-down. When the main characters were introduced in Hornet's Nest, I found them flat and unappealing. That hasn't changed. Even worse, it seems the author couldn't decide what kind of book she was writing: mystery? comedy? Disney-esque animal story?It's been a long time since I've failed to finish any book, and this is the first time I've given up on a Cornwell novel."
1,FICTITIOUS????,To everyone who thinks this is a completely fititious piece of work you should really do your research.It seemed to be a slap in the face.- from a former resident of Tanger Island
4,Come On - Give It a Chance,"I truly enjoyed this new kind of book from Patricia Cornwell. Those of you who hated it need to open your minds a little. It's a farce, a cartoon-ish kind of story (the animals talk!). I'll admit that I like the Kay Scarpetta novels best, but this one is MUCH better than Southern Cross. I laughed and laughed at the funny/strange names and events. I listened to it on tape (unabridged) so maybe that helped."
3,Has Cornwell Flipped?,"At first, I thought Cornwell had completely flipped... When the crab and fish started a conversation, I had to make sure this was the same author. The style is so different from all her other books. I had always preferred the ""Hammer"" series rather than ""Scarpetta"". At times it was refreshing to see government officials as she so humerously painted them. I later found out that there are actually guide horses for the visually impaired. It was a real change from most of her other novels, and I am looking forward to what she will write next."
1,Isle of Dogs,"An undergraduate assigned to Cornwell must have written this. Or her high school son or daughter. An adult did not write this book, and certainly no one edited it. That or Cornwell once had a really fantastic editor who re wrote for her. What happened????? I love the Kay Scarpettas. But Andy Brazil is boring, pendantic and has all the depth of a sheet of paper. The dog thinking was one thing, but when I got to the anthropomorphic plotting of a bucket of crabs (and a trout) I could not go on. This was not funny, or even amusing. I'm just glad I didn't buy this book. I'd be suing for the assault on and insult to my intelligence."
1,You can say that again,"I must agree with the other reviews - what an awful book. I started reading/listening to Ms. Cornwell's books in the order they were written, and they've gone down hill since Wesley was killed. They've progresively gone from bad to worse. I'm not sure where she's going with these (and the Kay Scarpetta books), but something needs to change. I didn't buy this book and probably won't the next. I'll check it out from the library first!"
1,Isle of Dogs,"Sorry, someone please tell me, Patricia Cornwell didn't write this book...I read 1/2 of it and just could not finish. I don't know if it was a tongue in cheek, a book meant to be funny, as in a parodity, but it didn't make it..I want the realPatricia Cornwell to come back in her next book like all the others she has written, full of mystery, excitement and guts.I am one of her biggest fans, love her work, but not this.."
1,Absolutely Terrible!,"To reiterate what many of the other reviewers stated, this is an absolutely terrible book! I found no humor in any of it, black or otherwise, and was very disturbed by the negative stereotypes of just about everyone. Please don't buy this book! How in the world did it become a NY Times bestseller. Undoubedtly people like me bought it just because we'd enjoyed previous books by Patricia Cornwall. I will never buy another book by this author because she subjected me to such absolute drivel."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I don't think I will ever again buy a book by simply trustingthe good reputation of a writer I have grown to admire,I drudged through the first 100 pages and it is like 4different story lines at once and none of them go any whereAndy Brazil an Chief Hammer are wasted in this one"
1,don't waste your money,I kept waiting for it to get better even after the first100 pages well needless to say I am still waiting!I really liked the Kay Scarpetta series and I always enjoya good story line but this reminds me of a James Pattersonbook that was way out there also
1,Let Isle of Dogs Lie,"If you are a Scarpetta fan, don't consider buying this book. I understand this an attempt at a different kind of humorous detective story, but it really falls flat -- poor plot, horrible dialog, talking animals, etc. (BTW -- I could almost let this book slide if it weren't for the talking crabs and fish)I almost abandoned it several times, but kept hoping it would get better. Alas, I was disappointed in the end -- not worth the time or money.Bring back the medical examiner! At least her murderers were interesting."
1,This deserves the worst book of the year award!,"It is not often that I read a book and have 50 pages left to go when I can't take any more and give up on reading it! That is what happened with this book! TERRIBLE is an understatement. I think that you should add a -1 star for ratings, it's very deserving. Talking crabs, a typing dog, ridiculous characters and a senseless story plot. There are characters that in the beginning you think are going to be focused on, but don't show up again until close to the end. I've read everyone of her books, repeatedly, but this one I can't imagine why the publisher wasted good paper on it! I know that when her next book comes out I will research it and read multiple reviews before I spend my money on it! I do hold out hope that she will again capture her exceptional writing skills of the past, she owes it to her fans!"
1,We want Kay! We want Kay!,"I just got through this book FINALLY. I had to force myself to finish it because I kept thinking it had to get better. It didn't. I spent my whole 10 day vacation in Hawaii trudging through this book. Waaahhh! C'mon, talking crabs, fish, and dogs? A wacky governor of Virginia who can't even tell which room he is in and his wife who spends all of her time collecting and hiding trivets? That could possibly be a believable humorous couple, but not for a governor and first lady of a state. And there was way too much discussion of the governor's gastrointestinal problems. Yuck! I hated those parts especially! Also, what was the deal with Unique and the rearranging of molecules? Was this book supposed to be comedy, supernatural, crime? I couldn't really figure it out. Please please please bring back Kay, Marino, and Lucy and let's solve some murders!!!!"
1,People Magazine,"We all know People Magazine can't be wrong!! Of the hundreds of thousands of books written this year to choose from, People selected 13 ""Worst of Pages"" books....no surprise to me Isle of Dogs was one of the 13. What a horrible little book. I couldn't get past the first 20 pages. I tried to get a refund, the store clerk laughed and said I was the 10th person THAT DAY that tried to return this book. I certainly hope Patricia Cornwall is doing some well needed reflection on each and every one of these customer reviews....C-U-S-T-O-M-E-R, get it Patrica? We are the ones who fork over our hard earned dollars to make you a wealthy woman and hopefully in return for those hard earned dollars we receive a well written book to enjoy. Not so in this case. She won't see ANY more of my hard earned dollars."
1,Stupidest book I've ever read.,"This was the biggest waste of my time this year. It is boring and nonsensical. A few times I thought Cornwell was trying to draw quirky characters a la Larry McMurtry in the Lonesome Dove novels. If so, she failed miserably. I tried to like these characters but they were just too stereotypical and silly. Having visited Tangier Island and finding the people there quaint, friendly and very interesting, I wondered what Ms. Cornwell was smoking when she went there."
1,I DIDN'T GET IT!,"I struggled through this book hoping to find that one shred of information that would tie it all together. I initially thought the book would take me down a path of crime and forensics, then the path split into bizarre, tongue-in-cheek events and personalities. Characters were introduced, mildly developed, then dropped without ever helping to develop the plot. Basically, I was very disappointed and I won't be so quick to pick up the next Patricia Cornwell novel."
1,Carl Hiassen she ain't,"First of all, I'm NOT assailing her for varying from her Scarpetta series. I've only started reading her, so I'm not one of those who is upset that she veered from her formula.It's just that she's not funny. Her extremely detailed way of describing things, which may work great with forensic details, totally kills any potential humor. It's like she's saying, ""Here's a situation. It's funny. Let me explain why it's funny..."" It's overkill, and shows a complete lack of understanding of the timing required for effective humor writing. The characters are not even wooden - they're styrofoam. And the Trooper essays are just bizarre - she's either showing off her trivia knowledge or using this as a platform for some unusual prejudices. Whatever they are, they don't work.She simply can't compete with the Carl Hiassen/Dave Barry/Elmore Leonard school of humor mixed with action and suspense.I guess she should stick to being the Female Joe Friday: Just the facts, ma'am."
1,I really disliked this book.,"I usually like Patricia Cornwell's books, but I really disliked this one. I did finally finish it -- hoping it would get better. It never did.Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of good books to be read -- this just isn't one of them.I hope she returns to her former style. I will be sure to read the customer reviews before buying another one of her books."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"There are precious few books that I can't finish and this is one - I simply could not make it to the end. It wasn't worth my time and it was quite painful to read. I was thankful that I got it from the library and didn't waste a penny on this horrendous book.I love Carl Hiassen's books so I thought this book would appeal to me (more than the latest Kay Scarpetta books which were pretty bad as well). It isn't in the same league. If not for the famous name behind this book, it probably would not have passed muster in any publishing house. The humor is forced, the characters are unappealing, and the plot (such as it is) is ridiculous."
1,The emperor has No Clothes!,"I've learned a lot about tough women and forensic medicine from Patricia Cornwell. Then I read Isle of Dogs. From this book I learned that if an author makes the best-seller list enough times, the publishing house and the critics will not dare tell her when she's produced a real gosh-awful stinker. I'm afraid I smelled this ""wonderfully sophisticated romp"" from fifty feet away. Next time, Patricia, let me read it first. I promise to level with you."
1,No sleeping pill for me...,"No sleeping pill needed for me-if I ever can't sleep, I will just pick up this book and try to finish it. I will be asleep in minutes. I tried-(really I did!)- but finally gave up in disgust when the dog started typing on the computer. Give me a break. This book was by far the worst book I have read in a long time. What in the world was Patricia Cornwell thinking? To me,reading a Patricia Cornwell book is like opening a Christmas present-I can't wait to see what is inside. What a disappointment. I wish I had never wasted my money on this one. I hope it is not an indication of books to come. Please, Ms. Cornwell if this book was a joke, don't ever do that again. Your readers are not amused."
1,Absolutely the Worst!,"I was, and I emphasize the word was, a big fan of Patricia Cornwell until this book came along. I bought the audio version of this book on Ebay and am at least grateful that the full price wasn't paid. This book is absolutely the worst book I have ever read (listened to). I kept holding out hope that somehow this book would get better (or perhaps less stupid), but it never happened. I felt like a prisoner in my own car as I listened to this horrible, horrible, horrible book. I couldn't wait to get rid of this book."
1,To think I paid Money for this book,"I just wanted to say that I bought this book because I have enjoyed all the others that she wrote. However, I think that it was one of the worst books that I have ever read, I do not like talking animals or fish. At least it taught me a lesson not to judge a book by its author."
1,Whatever was she thinking?????,"I cannot express my extreme disappointment in this book. It was so bad that I could not even finish it and just threw it in the garbage! What mindless, incoherent drivel. Obviously after chasing Jack the Ripper, Ms. Cornwell felt she had to get another book out and this was it. I hated everything about it, expecially Andy and his stupid website!!! I want my money back!!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I found this book to be very disappointing. I love the Scarpetta books, and Kay does make a brief appearance in this one, but it is a totally different type of story. I found the characters annoying and boring. I didn't care what happened to them; I just wanted it to happen soon and for the story to end. I forced myself to read the whole thing, but it was a chore. Bring back Kay!"
1,Dumb book...,"This book is really dumb. I realize that it's supposed to be comedic in nature, but I found it impossible to achieve the suspension of disbelief necessary to actually enjoy the story.Every time the island people's speech was represented, I just cringed. Nobody could speak that stupidly! The people on the island sound too dumb to be alive. (No offense to the actual residents of Tangiers intended.)Bottom line: dumb book! Don't waste your time reading it.Sorry Patricia - Love your Scarpetta series!"
2,Isle of Dogs,"I am a huge Cornwell fan. I have read every book she has written and liked them all - even Jack the Ripper, but I can't even finish this one. The style is not one I enjoy and the story has not yet grabbed me 4 chapters into the book. I'm putting it in the garage sale pile. I hope someone else enjoys it better than I. Please Patricia ... I know Kay is boring to you after all these year, but we love her."
1,Isle of Dogs,I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's books but couldn't get past one third of this one. So boring. The govener and his wife were a real drag. So was the absent plot-----couldn't even finish it. Sorry Patricia. I was really getting tired of the lesbian ungrateful niece any way.
1,One Star too many!,"I'm sorry, Ms. Cornwell. Up until now the only book that I had refused to finish was ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."" Now there is one more - ""Isle of Dogs."" I would recommend this book only to fans of the Three Stooges. After forcing myself to read half of the book, the first fifty pages with an open mind, I gave up the effort and moved on to something more interesting. The comedy seemed to be forced and the continuing characters of Brazil and Judy seemed lost in a maze of insipid characters with stupid names located on a fantasy island of bad dreams. Give the readers back what you do best, Ms. Cornwell, a well-written novel that makes sense while it entertains."
1,ugh,"What a great idea for a book. What a great opportunity for a departure from her usual writing style. What a hideous pile of [garbage].I was really looking forward to this book, but it is truly awful. It is way too contrived and completely implausible to be passed off as 'quirky' (for instance, the idea that all of Richmond was talking about Trooper Truth's meaningless essays). It's not witty at all; the 'quirks' are delivered with a very heavy hand. Parts of it were so poorly and simply written, I wondered if Cornwell even looked back over it after she wrote it.Don't waste your time."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I've ready every book Ms. Cornwell has ever written and enjoyed each one - until this one.There was nothing wrong with Hornet's Nest or Southern Cross - they were a nice change of pace. I have NO CLUE what this was supposed to be. This book was painful; I couldn't finish it. I got as far as the ""Dentist"" being held hostage - I bought this book the day it was released and didn't get to the ""hostage"" part until the beginning of December!Good luck to those of you trying to sell your copy; I doubt if you'll get anyone to bite.By the way, why wasn't Virginia West is this book? Or was she and I didn't get to that part?"
1,Disaster,I thought it was me! I managed to get through 46 pages before I couldn't take it anymore. What an absolute disaster. This book truly does not deserve even the one-star rating.Thank goodness I resisted the urge to purchase this ridiculous book. I am returning it to the library as soon as I finish this review.
1,Terrible,"I definitely should have read the reader reviews before purchasing this book. It was very, very disappointing not because it was a departure from the Dr. Kay series but because it was nonsensical and in my opinion not funny. I plodded through it hoping that it would get better but it didn't.This book was not worth reading."
1,A Painful Mistake,"I snapped up this book because it was by Cornwell, one of my favorite authors until now. I was surprised to find all the characters irritatingly foolish, and the story disorganized and unfunny (I assume it was intended to be funny). I laid it down, disappointed and bored, a third of the way through. Cornwell can't have written it. The person who wrote the Jar Jar Binks character in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" wrote this book."
1,could this be a hoax?,"I don't believe this was actually written by Patricia Cornwell. This must be the result of a twisted bet she made with some friends that an 11 year old could write a book and if Patricia sent it in under her ""best seller"" name it would get published regardless of merit. If this were a first novel being sent around without her name on it, it would never have gotten published.In order for a book to be satirical, it has to have some wit and intelligence. A book about nothing can be saved by excellent writing and a poorly written book can become a best seller if the plot is original and riveting. This is the worst of both worlds. Snoopy's ""It was a dark and stormy night..."" puts this to shame. I've never been so disappointed in the work of well known author. Many seem to ride on their automatic fan following from time to time, but this is in a class by itself. Isle of Dogs is a ""dog."""
1,Toss It,"This book 'Isle of Dogs' is perhaps the worst book I have read in a very long time. If it was intended to be funny, the author missed by a wide mile. Perhaps she had just watched a 'Dukes of Hazzard"" marathon. Forget this book. I'm sure Cornwall wishes she had."
1,What was her editor thinking?,"Thinking, no doubt, that you have to let the 800-lb. gorilla get a certain amount of bile out of her system before getting back to business as usual--churning out Scarpetta best-sellers. No one would have published this dreadful book had it been sent in by an unknown, or even a ""midlist"" author. And Cornwell should have known better than to send in a compendium of silly names, fart jokes and feeble attempts at Mike Meyers comedy. Humor is not her strong suit, as I hope she has learned by now. Leave it to Carl Hiasson."
1,Don't bother reading this...,This book was not good. It was hard to get through - a real departure for Patricia Cornwell who usually writes books that are at least interesting to read.
1,Can't Believe She Put Her Name on this Book!,"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for several years buying all her new books and acquiring older ones that I missed. I thoroughly enjoyed her work. However, this book doesn't seem like it fits in with her prior work. I have no idea where her head was when she was writing it. I am still struggling to finish it."
1,An enormous disappointment,"There is a definite difference between Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books and her others. Her others stink on ice. The characters are unbelievable, the plot absurd. I understand the need for a writer to try different things, but Ms. Cornwell's editor and literary agent should try to keep her ego in check. There was no reason for this book to be published, unless she was trying to write a parody of Hiassen or Leonard. If that was the case she had me fooled.The most frustrating thing about several of Cornwell's books is that she just seems to end them with no real resolution. She must give herself a number of words as a minimum and when she hits it she stops. There are ten characters in this book about whom we have no idea what happens to them.Kay Scarpetta is one of the most compelling characters in popular fiction. I will continue to read the books about her. I will not make the mistake of chasing Ms. Cornwell off the reservation the next time."
1,GOOD GRIEF!!,"Can you rate a book minus 5 stars? Either Patrica Cornwell has taken leave of her senses, she has gone off the deep end, or aliens have invaded her mind...maybe all three have taken place. Of course, she now thinks she has solved the Jack The Ripper murders, so who knows? This is a HORRIBLE book, one I could not finish and ended up throwing in the garbage. I will not waste one more penny of my hard earned dollars on any more of her books.... even if she brings Benton back from the dead in a Scarpetta novel. You owe your loyal readers better than this, Ms. Cornwell."
1,Isle of Dogs is a Dog,"I am an avid book-on-tape listener, and read a lot of hard cover books, as well. I love fiction, and have some favorite authors I seek when a new book comes out. Patricial Cornwell has been one of my favorites. I purchased the 4-cassette abridged version of ""Isle of Dogs"" looking forward to another Cornwell adventure. I am so grateful I have the abridged version, as I don't think I could have made it through even the first tape unabridged. I listened to the entire tape one, both sides, and could not justify wasting my time continuing. The plot (?), character development, names of characters, etc., etc., were so far beneath Patricia Cornwell, that I wonder if she is hospitalized and someone else has ghost-written for her. I have begun to recommend to my reading friends that they avoid this book, at all cost."
1,Don't Even Bother..,"This may well be my last Patricia Cornwell purchase. I can't believe how low she went in this one...calling black children 'nidgettes' repeatedly, portraying all the black characters in the book as uneducated, backward people who butcher the english language ('we's done' and multiple mistakes like muscular dysentery instead of dystrophy). And yet she wants the reader to believe that a dog is capable of taking a pencil in it's mouth and typing on a computer keyboard??? Come on! It's a ridiculous story with little respect to the reader or black people. And what's her problem with the citizens of the Commonwealth of Va.? Hmmm..they can't all be blind, bumbling, inbred or redneck race fans! She's collected my last dollar. The only reaason I gave it one star is because Amazon wouldn't let me leave it blank!"
1,A great author gone bad,"I wish I had read the reviews; however, I was so excited to see another book by an author I have enjoyed in the past that I bought it immediately. I was sadly disappointed. I have always had trouble putting her books down - this one I have trouble trying to finish. The names of the people are so fake you laugh at them, I mean Trish Thrash, Trooper Truth, Major Trader?! I'm will be reluctant to purchase any future books by Patricia Cornwall."
1,A Disappointed but Loyal Fan,"I have to agree with the other reviewers, I didn't enjoy this book at all. I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books From Postmortem to The Last Precinct, plus her cookbook. This book leaves me wondering why. Oh well, Lsle of Dogs doesn't get my vote,so what, I'll get over it and move on. I'm still a huge fan looking forward to Cornwell's next book."
1,The Worst!,I usually can't wait to get my hands on Patricia Cornwall's mysterys but this one was the worst! I couldn't finish it. She should stick with Dr. Scarpetta!
1,Where in the world is Patricia Campbell?,"What happened? I couldn't wait to read her next book...the truth is: I can't read her next book...it's TERRIBLE, BORING AND SENSELESS. Where in the world did Campbell go? This book is NOT Patricia Campbell."
2,What is she doing?,"I have all of Patricia Cornwell's books and wait with baited breath for the next release. I'm always wary when she steps away from Kay Scarpetta. This one was another disappointment. I thought Southern Cross was outside her element, but she seems to have gotten a better grasp of things with Isle of Dogs. Unfortunately, it is one of the most ethnically insulting books I've read in a long time! It takes us immediately back to Amos and Andy and Stepin Fechit. If this is an example of her only exposure to African Americans, then she might want to get out more because it is extremely stereotypical and casts all African Americans in this book in a bad light! The result is really insulting."
1,Skip it,"I picked up this book from a resale shop for fifty cents and I WAS ROBBED. This book is so bad I had to stop reading it about a third of the way thru. The names of the characters: Windy Brees, Unique something, etc. were the least objectionable and the plot unreal. What was that about pirates? So bad I will not donate it to avoid any other reader into starting it. I will throw it away. Shame on Cornwell and her editors. This does it for me so far as picking up anything by her."
1,"oooooohhhhh, it's supposed to be humorous!","What can I say about a book I had to look up on Amazon to find out what the heck I was listening to? I know authors sometimes become so melded with a character they've created, it seems as if the character writes the book and the author is along for the ride. I have for a long time liked Kay Scarpetta a lot more than I like Patricia Cornwell, mainly because I don't believe Ms. Cornwell can sustain a narrative or develop a storyline without Ms. Scarpetta's presence. But, I did buy this one with an open mind. After listening to two tapes, I thought maybe this was some elaborate joke on the author's and publisher's part, and that my refund would be tucked in with the last tape along with an award for slugging through to the end of this....thing."
1,"Who are you, and what have you done with Patricia Cornwell","I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this book. I could not get past the 8th chapter, and now I will not be forced to read about the talking crabs and fish. I too thought it would get better, now I don't have to endure the painful process of trying to finish a real DOG of a book. ... Why write and publish a piece [that is not up to her standards]such as this and suck in us loyal readers, who up until now bought everything with her name on it. Has greed reared it's ugly head? How convenient that Cornwell's website is not currently available. I'm afraid, the only redeeming feature of this book will be as a kindling starter in my fireplace!"
1,Isle of the Dogs,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and in my honest opinion this is the worst book that she has written. The plot was rambling and hard to understand, seemed it had no rhyme or reason. It was a hard read. I normally finish one of her good books (The Scarpetta Series) in one day, it took me two weeks to read this book, as I kept putting it down to read other books that held my interest. Being an avid reader, I can get through about any book, especially one written by one of my favorite authors, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I hope tht Ms. Cornwell is not ""burnt out"" as so happens to authors who turn out books too fast. I am looking forward to her next book to see if she goes back to her ""old"" style."
1,"""Comic Romp""...more like a humorless trek","I am not sure what I expected...maybe a plot, characters you cared about,a mystery to unravel, something like that. What I found was a silly, senseless waste of time. I always finish a book, if the author took the trouble to write it, a publisher believed it worthy of publishing, I believe I should read the entire thing before forming an opinion...I am considering changing my policy....this actually hurt to read."
1,Isle of Dogs,"I am a Patricia Cornwell junky, could not wait until her next book came out. This is not Patricia Cornwell at all! This is her worst book ever. This is nothing but silly and she even has the crabs about to be cooked with quotes, that keep popping back up with opinions. This book was a real chore to even finish, I kept reading thinking it would have to get better, but never did."
2,"2 stars, my charitable contribution to Ms Cornwell","I have read and enjoyed all of the Patricia Cornwell books, but let me tell fellow fans, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK, from the needlessly inane plot twists, and the characters that frankly I couldnt give a damn about <I ended up hoping the dog would get killed just so I wouldnt have to read about it any more> This has to be the worst book she has written to date, and makes me view any future books by her with extreme suspicion and mistrust. If this was the first book of hers that I read, I would never have read any others thats for sure....Here's hoping that she gets back on track (or at least on the train) with the next one!"
4,Talking Crabs,"A lot of fun, especially as an audio book, Isle of Dogs took me by surprise. The superhero, Andy, definitely has his white hat on for the challenge from the murderous Smoke, the iconoclastic Islanders, and the Governor's devious PR man, a pirate in disguise."
1,a resident,"Being a former resident of Tangier Island and now living in Orlando Florida I am ashamed of the inaccuracies that plague the book and am saddened that a publisher would allow such a poorly written book to be printed. Anyone who has any conections with Tangier Island would realize that this is not a ""fictitous"" story but merely a documentary of lies...."
4,i have to defend this book,"It shocked me to see such horrible reviews of this book. However, I haven't read any other Patricia Cornwell books, so I had no preconceived notions or expectations. Her loyal readers seem to hate this book, but I thought it was hilarious. I did find some of the violence a bit much and slightly bothersome, but it did not keep me from enjoying the rest of the story. If you like Carl Hiaasen, Michael Malone (Handling Sin), Christopher Buckley, you will enjoy this book."
1,Isle of Dogs,"Strange, bizarre book. Reader should be aware that it has talking ""trout"" and ""crabs"" (as in seafood) and just weird characters. Not to mention , Kay Scarpetta doesn't make an appearence until page 300. I forced myself to finish it."
1,Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!,"I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for a long time, but I can't imagine what she was thinking! Intelligent crabs? Cute names for intestinal problems? Completely idiotic characters with annoying accents and long essays on uninteresting subjects that have absolutely nothing to do with anything! All this narrated by someone who sounded embarrassed at the words she was forced to utter (as well she should be). Do not buy this book."
5,Branching out is not a sin,"It's unfortunate that so many readers are unable to come to terms with an author writing in more than one style. Anyone who had read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross should have been able to see that these novels had more humor and an altogether different style than the Scarpetta books. Forcing a writer -- or any artist -- to stick with one style and one set of characters is not the mark of a true fan. The fact that this novel goes deeper into the realm of black humor should be congratulated rather than reviled. For readers who ONLY want the Scarpetta style, then stick with the Scarpetta books and don't whine about the other books not living up to your expectations."
3,relax and enjoy,"I have just finished reading this book and at times I laughed so hard tears were streaming down my face. This must have been a really fun book for Patricia Cromwell to write. Normally she has to be so intense and intent on keeping characters, events, and evidence in perspective and maintaining a high state of suspense. How great it must have been to let her silly side take over and just go for light and satirical humor. I found the speech patters of the Islanders particularly interesting, many were familiar to me from my childhood, and yes people really do talk like that. So as you do with the Harry Potter books, suspend belief, lighten up and have a good read"
2,"Interesting audiobook, dull reader","The book is definitely a departure for Patricia Cornwell, and I probably would have enjoyed it had I bought the book instead of the audio version. The reader even makes pirates dull. It's very difficult to stay awake on a long drive listening to a droning monotone. Chris Sarandon read this book's predecessor Hornet's Nest. Get him Back"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, but this book is unbelievably awful. It doesn't qualify as a mystery or thriller. Maybe it's supposed to be an attempt at humor, but it fails miserably. The main cast of characters are base, incompetent and repulsive, including a governor whose world revolves around his bowel problems. The scenario is predictable and trite, with no surprises and no depth. I kept reading only because I thought I must be missing something somewhere, but whatever it was, I never found it. I'm sorry there isn't a zero-star option, because that's what I would rank this book."
1,There was a time when Cornwell's books were interesting...,but it seems now she has run out of interesting ideas. This book like all the books about Chief Hammer is boring. As I read the book it occurred to me that Ms. Cornwell might be trying to be humorous or satiric. If that was her idea she failed. Absurdity is not the same as humor or satire.Midway through the book she describes her Governor's policies as idiotic. She should have used that word to describe the whole book.
1,Dangerous to Your Health,"Absolutely do not listen to this book while driving. While on Tape 4 at 7 a.m. in the morning I dozed off, but managed to spring back awake again to gain control of my car. I promptly turned on the radio. Then I just had to see if my perception was on target that this book is absolutely horrible, and sure enough, most other reviews out of 630 were one-star, and as at least one person said, would have been 0 stars. If I want mystery humor and pets with human-like qualities, I will stick with David Handler and his Stuart Hoag and Lulu series.And the female narrator on the audio tape, though great with accents, was decidely very bad with male voices, of which there are many, like most of the main characters...part of the problem with putting me to sleep. I think this book would have faired better with a male voice.It is comforting that Patricia Cornwell has apparently written better novels, so I won't totally write her off."
2,Oh Ms. Cornwell...,"I am an incredibly devout fan of Ms. Cornwell, from her Ruth Graham Bell biography to Dr. Scarpetta to Judy Hammer. That said, I found this experiment into postmodern literature asinine and mind-numbingly boring. I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book (it's already been a week, a record for me and a Cornwell book) but if I keep waking my husband up with my groaning, he just might hide the book before I can finish it! While the parody might have worked with different characters (and a little more fleshing out), Cornwell has already introduced us to Hammer and Brazil - which makes it rather difficult to match these their caricatures with the characters we already know. Brazil's essays, while interesting, make room for plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Hopefully the esteemed Ms. Cornwell will return to her roots: fast paced, well plotted and thoroughly researched novels about strong women and the mysteries of the criminal mind."
2,what is patricia smoking,"If this wasn't written by an author I respect I would have closed it and gone on. It seems she is dreaming and writing what she sees. Brother, get back to what you know"
1,Talking Crabs?,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is an awful book. It's nice to see P. Cornwell lighten up and try to use humor, but a dog that can type on a keyboard is just bizarre."
1,not your aver5age p.cornwell,I missed Kay Scarpetta. I read 190 pages of this book thinking it would get better and I would become interested. I could not. Then I quit. Too many vast differences in story lines. Hard to follow.
1,Don't Bother,"I was very disappointed in this book. Even though I knew it was not going to be like her other novels, it was not what I expected from one of my favorites authors. I actually only read half of the book and then dropped it. My patience ran out when I came to the part where the fish and crab were having a conversation. Many other well known writers in this field have written novels that are light hearted or not their traditional books. I have enjoyed these (Painted House,Skipping Christmas for example). I think Cornwall should stick to what she writes best and future frivolous books like this should be written under a pseudo name."
1,What a disappointment!,Patricia Cornwell is going the way of John Grisham and forgetting to give us what we liked in the beginning. They both have opted for social commentary and exploration of their pet subjects rather than what they started with. I had to force myself to keep reading thinking it had to get better. Kay Scarpetta come back!!
1,Hours of my life I will never get back,"Please note the only reason that I even gave this one star is because zero or negative numbers were not an option. I want the hours that I spent reading this book back! What a piece of garbage. I cannot believe one of my favorite authors produced this. What was the point of this book. After this experience I will never again purchase a book by Cornwell without first reading the reviews. The moral of this story is she should stick to the Kay Scarpetta novels, clearly she has no idea how to write anything else.What was with the talking fish? And truly who cared about any of the characters. I think if Popeye really could speak she would have yelled, ""Get me the hell out of this nightmare of a novel!"""
1,a dog of a read,"very glad to have received this book for christmas - would have been upset if i'd paid for it with my own money. was extremely surprised and disappointed in the dialogue ...very English 101. example: an african-american police officer who starts and ends almost every sentence with, ""wooo."" the story was disjointed and unimpressive. left me wondering, ""who REALLY wrote this?"" again, the dialogue poorly written and distracting. ""plot"" is far-fetched and disappointing."
1,Why?,"My only reaction to Patricia Cornwell's ""Isle of Dogs"" is to ask ""why did she write this? and why did I read it""? Certainly I could have done other things with my time. I continued reading through this truly boring, stupid book only because I kept thinking ""it's got to get better""...no, it doesn't. I am a fan of the Kay Scarpetta novels and listened to one of the Andy Brazil novels on tape and that was so-so but this... If only I had logged onto Amazon and read some of these reviews before I bought this book. I won't read another one of Patricia Cornwell's novels unless it's a Kay Scarpetta."
3,Isle of Dogs,"I usually enjoy Cornwell's novels but couldn't wait for this one to end!!! Judy Hammer and Andy Brazil's characters were better developed in Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross. The only positive things in my opinion: the humor in Windy Breeze's stupidity, learning a little bit of history, and the brief moments that we heard from Kay Scarpetta."
1,"Vapid, Vacuous, Tasteless","I am generally a Patricia Cornwell fan, but this book is absolutely terrible. Her attempts at humor are at best stupid, and are often tasteless and even racist. Black comedies are supposed to have some believability and creditability but this one has none. Even the character's names, while supposedly funny, are just stupid puns (Major Trader, come on, you can do better than that!). And talking fish and thinking dogs! What! Please Ms. Cornwell, drop this ridiculous style!"
1,I can't believe 650 people FINISHED this book...,"i couldn't make it past page 100...i loaned it to several friends...they didn't make it past page 50...seriously, all you people that gave it 1 star? You READ the whole thing??? Really????I'm impressed......"
1,A Could Not Read,I can say that it is a very rare occasion when I do not finish anything I start. Except this time. I could not believe that an author I have enjoyed in the past would write a book that was so laborious. Maybe I did not give it a chance but by Chapter 7 I decided it was a waste of my precious time.
1,"No more Cornwell, EVER.","I had read almost every Scarpetta novel up to this point, and would have continued. But this was too much. Lacking in any coherent plot, poorly written, ridiculous to the extreme. I've sworn off all Cornwell (with the exception of her non-fiction book about Jack the Ripper.)"
1,Thank God It's Over,"I couldn't stop reading it, thinking maybe it'll get better. I mean, Right? It's got to get better. It doesn't get better. I've never been so happy to finish a book."
1,This is an entirely disappointing book,"I didn't even finish it. It tries to be funny and just falls flat. I read Patricia Cornwell's books for suspense. Her other books, particularly ones involving Kay Scarpetta, are wonderful. I guess that's even more reason to dislike this book because it is not up to the caliber of her other books."
1,Isle of Dogs,"Cornwell must be revisiting her youth and her love of ""The Little Mermaid"". Talking crabs..?????Don't waste your time as I did trying to read this."
1,"Not a ""beach book""","I agree with the review by ""iqhope"" but must say to those of you looking for a suspense, that this book has none of it. It's just basically a story, not a mystery. I will not discuss other points mentioned in other reviews but would like to mention a bizarre part of the story. Unique, one of the road dogs, is described as having a Purpose and a darkness inside of her. She commits a murder or two and although the reader knows this, the cops never figure this out and we never learn what the deal is with her Purpose. This was the only bit of mystery I was able to find. Maybe there is a sequel that will explain these loose ends. I'm not sure if I would read it though as I had to force myself to finish this one, and I am a huge fan of the Kay Scarpetta series."
1,I Listened to the WHOLE THING!,"So many writers have said they could not finish this book! They were the smart ones! I actually listened to the whole thing, hoping against hope that it would finally make sense. I was wrong! It is a book that doesn't know what it wants to be! Is it a crime book? Well. . . not really! Is it a popular presentation of regional history and lore? Maybe, but that's not enough reason to listen to or read it. Is it a comic romp? Most assuredly, no! Is it a carefully crafted novel of forensic investigation starring Dr. Kay Scarpetta? Hah! Scarpetta appears as a very minor character. . . and she was probably embarrassed to be there.People will buy this book because it's by Cornwell. They should read all these reviews before they part with one cent. And Cornwell should go back to doing what she does best: giving readers more of Dr. Scarpetta and her pathology lab!"
1,One Star is Too Many!,"I wish amazon had a dog symbol or less than one star. I have yet to finish this book. When reading most Cornwell books I haven't wanted to put them down. With Isle of Dogs, I don't want to pick it up off of my night stand! It is THAT BAD! I had finished all of her previous works and was anxiously anticipating my pre-ordered copy of this book. I was sorely disappointed."
1,An atrocious experiment,"I am an avid reader, and I wait impatiently for my favorite authors. Patricia Cornwell used to be in that group. But, after reading this complete waste of money, I doubt I'll ever read another of her books. I struggled, literally, through about one third of this trash until I slammed it shut and threw it off the balcony. It is the most poorly written book I have ever had the misfortune to open. I don't know what she was thinking, but whatever it was, it sure didn't work. The writing is barely beyond a sixth grade level. The extreme use of dialect is barely understandable. The ""Trooper Truth"" rants are reminiscent of Dennis Miller. Save yourself the money. Don't even think of buying it. Go to the library and open any page. At least you won't be able to throw that one off the balcony."
1,What was she thinking,"Did Patricia Cornwell really write this or let a child use her name?I too have loved all Patricia's book and very much looked forward to the latest installment of Judy Hammer, Andy Brazil, and Virginia West. This was defniitely NOT worth the wait. I hope this isn't a new trend for future Cornwell books. I do believe I'll wait until the paperback of the next novel comes out."
1,I was embarrased for a great author,"The reviews calling this book a ""dark comedy"" aside, I felt embarrased for Particia Cornwell. The more I read, the worse I felt. The chartacter development is lacking, there are too many spotty, unresolved story lines, and nothing that reads as if it were meant to cause you to laugh. It felt more like going to a movie and finding that everyone was laughing AT the movie rather than wITH it. Ms. Cornwell has written so many better books. If you must read this, buy it used or wait for the paperback. You'll probably want to pass it on rather than keep it. I did."
1,Patricia Cornwell must be suffering from stress or boredom!,I'm a faithful Patricia Cornwell follower. I always buy her books without even reading the cover. This book was a shock! I thought that using existing characters was a mistake. Maybe this form of humor would have worked with a fresh cast but these were characters that I thought I knew. I hope she returns to her familiar style of writing. I was very disappointed.
1,Buy this book-it's the perfect kindling!,"Cornwell courts the unusual here, and I don't mean unusual as in the latest twisted killer or another gore flecked Scarpetta autopsy scene. I mean the quirky inhabitants of an isolated island. Did I care about the characters? Nope. They seemed forcedly strange, too bizarre, too crazy swampfolkish. Did I laugh? Nope. The jokes were heavy handed. Plot? Argh, matey. It lost my interest. Excuse the pun but she is way out of her depth in this island based allegedly humorous tome. This is all harsh coming from a Cornwell fan like me, I admit it! I had hoped the story would get better but I was disappointed and felt that my time was wasted. Don't make the same mistake!"
1,I'd rather give it a zero!,"Oh, my.....this is a pathetic waste of print. This book is embarassingly bad. Please, don't waste your money. It's just truly awful."
1,Apologize to Carl Hiaasen,to even compare this book to Carl Hiaasen is borderline blasphemy. The arrogance with which this book is written makes me think that Ms. Cornwell is only trying to impress us with her knowledge of mundane details. And Trooper Truth? what's that about - to my mind it had little to do with the plot at all - assuming there is a plot in there somewhere. Glad I checked it out of the library
1,What the heck is going on?,"I have been a big fan of Ms. Cornwell since ""Body Farm"". What was she doing when she wrote ""Isle of Dogs""? I gave up one quarter of the way through. She hops back and forth from a suspensful serial killer to a circus (with many clowns) running the police department and the state. I can't get past the character names such as ""Trooper Truth"" and ""Trish Thrash"" aka ""T.T"". Please give up the comedic effort."
1,This is a rip-off,"I ,like others here,have read all her novels which up until now remained entertaining and valuable even when one gets past her fascination/preoccupation with making lesbianism mainstream. This book is a bad imitation of Carl Hiaasen's worst works(anything after the first two). The jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't compelling the coincidences are too fantastic to make it possible to suspend disbelief. This will be one of only about 5 books I ever stopped reading after 150 pages."
1,"Perhaps She's Lost ""It!""","As a reader of all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was anxious to see this one come out but now am extremely disappointed in ""Isle of Dogs""!!! What happened to her? Is this suppose to be a comedic novel or a serious one? The names of her characters are inane such as ""The Clot Sisters,"" ""Hooter,"" ""Major Trader,"" etc., and the vivid descriptions of the Governor's gastrointestinal problem is so unlike her previous books! I appreciate the research she did regarding pirates, the use of languages by pirates, but this book was not her usual excellent writing. Perhaps she has lost it or just ran out of ideas with the fiction genre and should write a nonfiction such as the one I hear she's doing on ""Jack the Ripper.""Personally, I don't think I will read any more of her books if they are anything like this one!"
1,NOT worth the effort,"And it WILL be an effort to finish this book. I was so disappointed by how bad this book is. I bought it based on the author's reputation and my personal enjoyment of her previous work, but this book is BAD. I actually finished it, hoping it had a point, but it was a waste of my time.There are too many characters all of whom are over-the-top wierd. There is too much going on for the book to flow and it never really comes together. The unnecessary sexual details and references made the book even more difficult to wade through.Here's hoping her next will be better. I will not be the first to buy the next one, though."
1,A dog about an Isle,"I was very disappointed in the latest Patricia Cornwell work. My wife introduced me to her mysteries several years ago and I had grown to like and look forward to her works. However, I am sorry I wasted my time on this one. This book really tarnishes the image of this fine writer. I am afraid I will not be anxious to buy her next book. I shall wait until I have read several reviews.This book is an attempt at humor and intrigue. It did not work for me.Sorry.Mitch Sanner"
1,What in the world?,"I am so dissapointed in Isle of Dogs. I felt like I entered a bad childrens novel. What in the world happened. I have every book by Patricia Cornwell, and have realy injoyed all of them. I am half way through this one and plan on not finishing it.I am so sorry I paid hard cover price for Isle of Dogs. I should have sat down at the book store and read the first 3 chapters before I bought it. I can only go as low as one star but it deserves no stars. Sad for a 6 Star Author."
1,One of the worst novels...by my favorite author,"I have to concur with all the other poor reviews...this novel was a huge disappointment. I kept reading and reading, waiting for an actual, tangible, and well-developed plot to emerge, but one never did. This book in particular includes exaggerated, banal characters that bored me to tears. From now on, I'm going to peruse reader reviews on amazon before automatically trusting the ""bestseller"" advertisement on the front cover of Cornwell's books."
1,"Stupid. I'm sorry, there's just no other word.","It's hard to believe that the creator of Kay Scarpetta wrote this. The humor is lowbrow, the situations and characters are crass and unbelievable, the plot is weak. Cornwell's created a universe where everyone is on the decline, or never got high enough to have a decline. They are ugly, stupid and rotten except for the shrinking Hammer and the irritating Brazil. It's tough to read a book where literally every piece of action requires someone to be incredibly stupid. It's beyond farce, it's even beyond slapstick. It's just stupid. If this book were written by anyone other than Cornwell it would never have been published."
1,"As painful to read as ""Showgirls"" was to watch","If it's supposed to be funny, shouldn't the reader laugh...at least once? I did cringe several times.My favorite part is when flatulent ole Crimm is convinced that his wife Maude (described as 70-years-old and looking clown-like having had too many cosmetic procedures) is having affairs with hot, young men. See, he thinks she is hiding men in the linen closet but she's REALLY hiding trivets that she's buying over the internet (she's not supposed to be wasting money on trivets, you see). Ha! Ha! What a zany mix-up!Am I really amused or is that just ""backward talk?""You decide.I have a crooked table leg to fix..."
4,Decide For Yourself!,"I was very sorry to read so many bad reviews of this book. I received it as a Christmas present, and read it in a few days. No, it's not about Kay Scarpetta, but this is not a bad thing. After ""The Last Precinct,"" I was getting a little tired of 'the psychology of Kay' and needed a change.This book is a refreshing comedy about the police and the government. Some of Andy's essays were hilarious. The humor is not laugh-out-loud-pie-in-the-face kind of humor, but a lot more subtle and a lot more satirical.Granted, some people may not enjoy the history of the islands in the Chesapeake Bay as much as I, a native Marylander, did, but give it a chance."
1,It's not worth reading for Free--Don't waste your time.,"I'm a huge Cornwell fan, and I can't believe she wrote this. It has absolutely no good points. Don't even check it out at the library, it's not even worth reading for free! I'm from Richmond, VA and am ashamed that this book was set here. Please do not waste your time reading the book cover. Crabs, fish and lobsters have dialogue in this book. Enough said."
2,Leave it to Carl Hiaasen,"In the past, it's taken me maybe two pages to get fully immersed in a Patricia Cornwell book. I admit I'm a techie; her forensics-based novels have delighted me for many years.I had no idea what I was getting when I bought Isle of Dogs.It took me two starts - separated by two different books - and over 100 pages to get into Isle of Dogs.Yes (or, Yas!) I eventually finished this book and yes, it did get better, farther into it.But with all due respect, as Andy Brazil might say to Chief Hammer, Ms. Cornwell really should leave this kind of thing to Carl Hiaasen.Please, bring back Kay Scarpetta!-a."
1,"Dumb, Dumber,& Dumbest",This was awful -- the stretch for humor was rediculous. I was grossly disappointed with Ms. Cornwell's work. It was a tremendous disappointment. Ms. Cornwell tried to combine her murder mystery style into a ludicrous scenario & ruined both the comedy & the mystery. This was so bad that it was one of the very few books I didn't bother to finish -- just put it in the 'resale' bin for the next yard sale!
1,Gone Wrong,"I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell, however I though Black Notice was bad, this book is awful. Don't waste your money. Patricia really disappointed me with this writing. The characters names alone were confusing and the backward talk made the book very hard to follow. Could not even finish this one.Sorry Patricia, maybe a vacation is due."
1,The worst book I have read in a long time.,"I guess I should have read the reviews here (on Amazon) before starting this stinker. I ""read"" the audio book version, which comes on 10 cassettes. I finished it against my better judgement, as I should have stopped after the first or second cassette. But I was on a trip and didn't have a replacement book to listen to, so I plodded through it. And I foolishly kept thinking that it had to get better. It didn't.The characters are cartoonish and the plots - if you can call them that - are mind-numbingly unbelievable. More than once, I thought to myself ""this is just plain stupid"".I've never read a Patricia Cornwell book before. Perhaps I'll give her another try, as this book seems to be an aberration according to Cornwell fans."
1,Left the Book on the Plane,"At least I bought the paperback version. After 43 pages, I could stand no more. The book was simply foolish....not funny!I left the book in the plane's seat pocket but I felt guilty afterwards. What if some Cromwell fan found it and wasted their time reading the whole thing?Do yourself a big favor and pass on this one."
1,Patricia Cornwell goes to the dogs,"What might have possessed Patricia Cornwell to demean herself and her readers with this book? The attempted mixture of satire, humor and crime simply doesn't work. I bought this Isle of Dogs eagerly anticipating a great mystery story, hoping for another Scarpetta tour de force, and instead found nothing that remotely resembled her past books. A passing reference to Medical Examiner Scarpetta was the best I could find. And her attempts at satirical humor? Give me a break! Instead of searching the twisted minds of her criminals, now Cornwell tells us instead of the content of the minds of blue crabs as they attempt to escape from a crab pot. All in all, a waste of time and money. I shall find it very difficult to ever trust another Cornwell book. Please, someone, tell me that she will never do this again."
1,Only because there isn't a choice of zero stars,"I've always liked the Patricia Cornwell novels - And I'm also a big Carl Hiassen fan. So I was happy to see Cornwell go in the Hiassen direction....until I actually read this garbage. There's a way to be dark and funny, and then there's simply trying too hard. And Ms. Cornwell tried WAY too hard to show off her ""sense of humor"". I'm sure if I could let my eight year old read a book about a group of killers, she might find talking seafood funny, but I'm sure even she would get annoyed at all the NASCAR name dropping in one sequence. What point did that part serve, anyway? Probably the same thing the whole book was trying to prove - Ms. Cornwell saying a giant ""look what I can do, isn't it great?"". Maybe it's not her fault. Maybe it just comes down to the fact that Virginia just doesn't have the comic value that Florida does. Leave the dark comedy to the Florida guys, Leonard and Hiassen, and go back to what you do well."
1,Bad no matter how much I tried!,"No matter how much I tried to like this book, I couldn't even bring myself to endure it. Being a person who never, never fails to finish a book, Isle of Dogs caused me to break that streak. Flat out this is an awful book. There are no characters to like. No wit or humor. No story to keep you coming back. And no reason to have wasted the paper printing the book. I can't believe Cornwell or the publisher would even put this on the shelf. This product is an insult to any reader. IMHO don't, DON'T, waste your time on this one."
1,Isle of Dogs-don't,"What was she thinking? I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan. That is becoming a thing of the past. This book is stupid. The characters are unbelieveable, alomost cartoonish. I wasted my money. Plese, Please someone get her back on the right track. Don't waste your time (even if you get the book free)."
2,"I'm an avid fan, but....","This is the WORST of Patricia Cornwell. I really enjoyed the first Judy Hammer book, so I was excited to see a sequal, but I could hardly make myself finish the book. The plot was dumb and confusing. It tried hard to be funny, but wasn't. I don't criticize Cornwell for doing something different; a lot of authors pull it off, but this book was just plain bad."
1,Very disappointing reading.,"This is my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I had hoped to read other novels by this author, if I found this novel entertaining. Sadly, it is a very bad read. I was tempted to put the story down many times but continued to hope it would improve, it does not. I understand that this novel is a big departure for the author, so perhaps I will try one of her more characteristic works. This one is not worth reading."
1,Isle of Dogs - Bad Book,"This is the last ime I buy a Patricia Cornwall book that is not a Scarpetta novel. No plot, no rhyme, no reason. Her attempts at humor are [bad]. It was just plain awful!!"
1,Ugh! This was just painful.,"I've read 3 or 4 other titles by Patricia Cornwell and found them interesting and creative. This book, however, failed to fall in to either of those categories. The book is full of weak characters and a story line that really never takes you anywhere."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"A jumble of thinly sketched characters (including a crab and a trout) speaking an obscure dialect in a convoluted pointless plot. I nearly put this book down many times, but plowed through to the end wondering if it could possibly get any worse. I wasn't disappointed. I kept thinking this must be some publisher's idea of a joke. You know, passing a book from author to author, each writing a chapter of ""can you top this?""If you want to smile when you read, get some Hiaasen. If you want to be laughing out loud, get Evanovich. Cornwell would do better to can the comedy and stick to what she does best."
1,Not worth the time,"I bought this book thinking it would continue in the same vein with Judy Hammer and Andy Brazil, already established characters (although nowhere near as interesting as Kay Scarpetta). There were 2 or maybe 3 isolated incidents in this book which were amusing, but the book overall is so uneven it was a chore to read. Perhaps if the author hadn't used characters already known to readers? But then again, it's hard to consider something as a ""light-hearted romp"" when people get slashed to pieces. This book didn't know what it wanted to be or do."
1,The Worst Piece of Trash,I can't even believe that Patricia Cornwell even wrote this. ... I feel like I really wasted alot of time trying to struggle through it to get to the end. Which was also very disappointing. Animals had conversions with each other in the horrible book. I don't even know what the point of the book was even after finishing! Do yourself a favor and Don't read this [stuff]!
1,Isle of Dogs by Patricia Cornwell,"This book does not follow the traditional style of the author. In fact it borders on the ridiculous. After reading many novels by this author, I was very disappointed in this particular book. I hope that this style of writing was just a fluke!"
1,What hopeless drivel,"Cornwell did very well with Kay Scarpetta but humor is not her forte. This inane nonsense insults one's intelligence. Please, no more!"
1,Is this a joke....,"I like the many reviews before thought this book was just horrible. I tried and tried to continue, but I did get further then some. I am upto page 152. I'm not saying I could do better but please let the author no that next time I will be a little leary of purchasing her book on the blind without reading the jacket cover."
1,Moronic,"When I started this book, I thought that what I was reading wasa joke, but as I continued, I realised that the author was TRYING to be funny with absolutely no success. I could not evenfinish the book with its unbelievably moronic characters. Ifthis is meant to be a comedy or a parody, I have to say to theauthor ""stick to mystery & suspense"""
1,No purchase here,"I've always loved the Kay Scarpetta books; I found Southern Cross a little difficult. After reading SO MANY bad reviews, I will not purchase or even attempt to read Isle of Dogs. Sorry, Patricia, but ALL these people can't be wrong!"
1,This Book Is A Dog,The only reason this book sold was because it has Patricia Cornwell's name on it. This is the worst book she's ever written. I forced myself to read half of it and hated every minute. Bring back Kay Scarpetta!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!
1,Readers Beware,"This book wasted 3 hours of my life which I will never get back. I like the fact that Cornwell has decided to take a different path and expand her writing but Isle of Dogs is a jumble of boring and incoherrent passages loosely put together. It seems Cornwell must be trying to fulfill some contract with her publisher and that is why she released this book of nonsense. It is meant to have a comedic theme, well it doesn't! The characters and plot are so unbeleiveable and moronic I would suggest that anyone who enjoys this book should seek serious professional help!"
1,This was one of the few books ever I just couldn't finish.,Words can not describe how much I detested this book. I have real every one of Patricia Corwell's books and loved some and some liked some but didn't hate any.The book is just stupid. It has no plot just some loose characters with silly names. I don't know how such a talented author could put her name to such garbage. I just wish it was like bad fish in the grocery store - you could return it and get your money back. Never again will I subject myself to her writing.
1,Are you kidding me?,"A lady I worked with got me reading the Scarpetta mysteries several years ago, so it was only natural that I picked up a copy of ""Isle Of Dogs"" when I saw it in the grocery. I'm amazed at the difference between the Scarpetta series and this turd. Even though the last couple of Scarpetta books haven't been up to the standards set in the early books, they still had some class to them. No such luck here. I got the idea that Ms. Cornwell wanted this to be a humorous swipe at someone, but it comes off as anything but humorous. It's like reading a junior high kids snotty send up of his teachers; done without class, without humor, and worst of all, without heart. It's obvious that Ms. Cornwell has some axes to grind, but I can't say I care to do the research necessary to figure out why. If you haven't spent your money on this yet, by all means, don't. Amazingly bad."
1,Uh...wow...Completely Sucks?,"I have never before not finished a book I started. I am an avid reader and have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell but I found myself skipping over sentences, then paragraphs, then PAGES of this book before I, about halfway through, closed it for good. I can't imagine how it would get better or what could possibly make it worth my time. Awful, awful, awful. Honestly, I think it was the worst book I've ever read."
1,really horrible,"I have enjoyed Cornwell's other books as fun, ""airport-novel"", escapism reading, but this book isn't even that. No plot, no suspense, just horrible writing, hackneyed characters, and poor attempts at humour."
1,Isle of Dogs by Patricia Cornwell,"I am a great fan of Patricia Cornwall but her new books outside of foresic science are a mega disappointment and I couldn't even bring myself to finish Isle of Dogs; it was so poorly written, made no sense what-so-ever and had no direction that half way through I'd had enough!I'm afraid unless it's a Scarpetta book I will not waste my money on any more Patricia Cornwall books, she should stick to her field of epertiese and save us all a lot of money and wasted time."
1,Don't bother to buy this book,"Like others reviewing this book, I am (or was) a Cornwell fan. We are used to Cornwell plots with realistic female characters and a strong sense of suspense. In this book, the characters don't ring true and the plot is less than interesting. Apparently, this is an attempt at humour. Maybe if you are paid huge advances you feel honour bound to fill the quota of titles."
1,I did not like this book at all,"I didn't like the characters, the dialect, or the plot.No matter how much you love Patricia Cornwell, I don'tpredict that you will like this book."
1,As a Cornwell fan----VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Having read every book written by Ms. Cornwell, this was the absolute worst! ""Southern Cross"" was a bad start for the introduction of these characters, but ""Isle of Dogs"" is ten times worse. I've already given the book away and am not sure if I would pay for the next book she comes out with."
1,Isle Of Dogs,"I'm sorry, I have read several books by Cornwell and is is by far one of the dumbest books I have ever read. The premise is totally beyond belief and the characters are really bad.Did she wake up one morning and realize she had a publishers deadline in a week and throw this pile of ... together?Bring back Kaye Scarpetta or send back the royaly checks, this was a total waste of my time (and I should have listened to my friend who said she stopped at page 25)...."
4,Black humor romp,"Unlike other reviewers, I loved this book. I went romping through it, laughing all the way. I salute Patricia Cornwell's more than active imagination.How different this genre than the usual Patricia Cornwell gory tales of the adventures of Dr.Scarpetta. Nonetheless, Cornwell shows the same mastery in ""Isle of Dogs"" in her description of her characters, each of which in this case are wacky to the extreme, and her departing of esoteric information, which in this book is about archeology and the history of the Chesapeake Bay area.Read this book for the absurd imagination of the writer and give Dr. Scarpetta some time off."
4,laughed myself silly,"I have read almost every Patricia Cornwell novel and find ""Isle of Dog's"" a truly hilarous departure from the seriousness of her Kay Scapetta series. If you don't like reading it yourself, buy the ""unabrigded audio version"". I love this one so much I could listen over and over. Nothing is sacred in this book, every character is stereotypical, with names like, Wendy Breeze, Dr. Faux, Unique Self, Trooper Truth, etc. You are privy to the thoughts of the animals, at which point I realized it was different from ""Kay Scarpetta"" series. Even though the plots are intertwinning and misunderstood between characters, this only adds to the chaos, which so often mimics real life. Sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction. I say read the AUDIO VERSION. You will laugh your head off."
3,Hopefully the next one will be better.,"I have loved these characters since the first book and this one was a let down. It seemed like there was little flow to the book and the two ""friends"" Andy and Hammer no longer had that chemistry and pull that they had in the previous 2 books. There was too much of the author trying to be funny and I don't read these books to get humor out of them. It ended up belittling the characters and promoting stereotypes. In any case, the book had little mystery and suspense and I am hoping that the next book involving these characters is better."
1,Another Book I Couldn't Finish..,"I sure wish people would quit comparing this book and Cornwell's ""new"" style with Carl Hiaasen. He's the master and she should never have gone there. This book was B-O-R-I-N-G, unfunny and went nowhere. Against my ""rules of reading"", I quit at page 85 and dropped it back at the library for the next unsuspecting reader."
1,Do not buy this book.,"Do not buy this book. This book is awful, confusing, dull, and unbelievably idiotic. If you recieved it as a gift, I'm sure it was a regift, whoever originally received it palmed it off on you. I would certainly re-examine the relationship of anyone who gave me this book to see exactly what I had done to make them think so poorly of our friendship. Do not buy this book and think twice before you give it away. Perhaps it's best use is a nice winter fire, literally."
1,I did borrow this book and DID throw it in the trash,"I have never posted a book review on amazon, however, this time I felt compelled to do so, if only it was to lower the overall rating for this literary disaster.From page one, this is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to turn to the next page. I am about half way through the book, but will not finish it. If I never hear the term ""submarine"" again, it will be too soon, thanks to this horrible piece of ....."
1,Disappointed,I have read all of Cornwell's books but found this very disappointing. There is little continuity. She goes off on too many tangents while not explaining. I felt like the next chapter would resolve questions but it left me more in the dark. READERS ARE LEFT HANGING AS SHE FLITS FROM ONE SCENE TO ANOTHER WITH MAKING NO SENSE> GO BACK TO SCARPETTA>
1,I wish you had a negative star..,"I love Patricia Cornwell, own everything she has written...until now. I was somewhat disappointed in Southern Cross, but I still liked it. This Isle of Dogs is one of the most stupid things I have ever read, bar none. I am insulted that she would think her fans are this stupid."
1,Isle of Dogs,"Like others, I wish I had read the reader reviews before buying this book! The reviews were better reading. As a loyal Cornwell reader, I managed to finish the book, but I still wonder why I did it. Please, Patricia, stay with what you do best next time. As for me, next time I intend to read the reviews first before I invest in another Cornwell book."
1,Worst book I've read in a long time,"I've always been a Patricia Cornwell fan, and bought this book the day it came out, anticipating another great read. I just got the book finished...what a disappointment! The stories were confusing, there were too many characters, the ending was awful, the history was boring, and nothing was funny about any part of the book. I won't be excited about the next Cornwell book!I wanted to give it zero stars, but the program won't allow it."
1,A disappointment,"Having looked forward to reading another Patrica Cornwell novel, I was very disappointed with this one and almost didn't get through it all. The characters were unappealing and the premise was a little too loony. Fans of Patricia Cornwell will be disappointed."
1,Awful!!,"I cannot believe how bad this book is..has Ms. Cornwell been taken over by an alien? Please, go back to thr well-writtrn Kay Scarpetta series. Tjis is simply NOT funny, the people are ridiculous caracatures (the governor with his gastriointestinal problems, the weird peple on Tangier island) oh, spare me!!I usually automatically buy a new Cornwell, but will think rwice now since this was such a waste of money! Don't buy this book. You will be disappointed if you are expecting a good mystery."
1,Horrible,"i can't believe she wrote this! mercy, made me sick so i didn't get very far into it and then threw it away. it was almost like the book was bad karma. she should stick with the kay books or write on what she found out on jack the ripper. i understand she knows who the killer is so it should be a good read."
1,Disappointing,"As an avid Patricia Cornwell reader I could not believe this book was written by her. It was horrible, I failed to find the humor in it (guess if you like very dark humor you could find it) and the characters were poorly described and the plot very fragmented. I put the book down after reading half of it, I just wasn't motivated to finish. Picked it up several months later, and finishing it was something I regretted wasting my time on."
2,hard to describe,"This was one of the strangest books I've read. Cornwell was recommended to me as a good writer of mysteries. I think she wrote a book that I read, based on forensic evidence of Jack the Ripper, which was pretty good. This book, however, was amazing. Amazingly bad, that is. Or amazingly bad for a well-written book. The writing style was fine, the editing fine. It was just that the characters, the story, the attempts at humor, were horrible. (Well, I did giggle a few times, mostly in bemusement.) The best description I can come up with is that it makes as much sense as ""Disney of Ice"" doing ""Hill Street Blues"" would make. I will try Cornwell again, once, to see if her more typical material is to my taste."
1,Winning the lottery 10 times is more plausible than the plot,"Nothing makes sense. I kept waiting for a plot, or even something interesting. The characters keep running into each other in ways not possible in real life. Of the over 500 titles I own, this is only the third I have wanted to throw away. I made it to the end only to have regretted it. I bought this because of how I have enjoyed her other titles. I will now avoid any further titles from Patricia Cornwell."
1,Isle of Dogs,"Confusion is the name of the game in the Isle of Dogs by Patricia Cromwell. It's as if she has taken several manuscripts and tried to blend them into one long drawn out story. The characters that she introduced in ""Southern Cross"" are back along with several new uninteresting ones. These characters have no type of personality and some have no reason for being in the story. There was one character, Unique, who could have really been made interesting if she had been fleshed out more. Then she tries to tell a story within a story through a series of newsletters that are confusing. The book was wordy and it took me more than a week to read it because it was so uninteresting until the very end. This book really dropped the ball and I would recommend anyone to buy it."
1,disappointed doesn't begin to sum it up,"Please, please don't waste your time on this poor offering but wait (hopefully) for Dr. Kay to reappear. This silly, stilted, ""comedy"" based on some hurtful stereotypes and crazy dialogue is not worthy of Cornwell. I dragged myself through it and wish I hadn't."
1,Isle of Dogs is for the Dogs!,"This is the worst book by Cornwell. I can't even see what her purpose was, given she has us accostumed to her excellent books. A true disappointment!"
1,couldn't make it to Disc 2,"Over the past couple years I've enjoyed audio recordings of both the Kay Scarpetta and Judy Hammer series, while painting, gardening, etc. Gruesome, but fun and full of marvelous little bits of information. I know this book is an attempt to change gears, but by the time I had reached the end of Disc 1, I couldn't take anymore. Has Cornwell lost it? Did someone else write it? Thank goodness it came from the library. . ."
1,LESSON LEARNED,"Since I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, I didn't find it necessary to check out the reviews. I have learned my lesson! This is the biggest waste of time I've ever spent and I have nothing positive to say about the book. It is hard to understand why any author with a faithful following would change their style of writing. Others have done it but while initally disappointing their readers, their books usually have some redeaming factors. This one has nothing going for it unless you enjoy a book with totally stupid people in it. Comic? I don't think so."
1,NOT UP TO SNUFF,I love to read Cornwell's novels. But since I have started this one I only get a few pages and can't keep my eyes open. This says a lot since I read an average of 5 hours a day. I doubt that I will finish this book.It is confusing and what is up with the names of these people.Well judge for yourself but as for me I will hope she puts out another of the type she is known so well for.
1,Unbelievable!,"I have read all the Scarpetta books. The last ones were slightly repetitive and less interesting than the former ones. But I have also read the Hammer/Brazil books and I like Southern Cross a lot and Hornet's nest is quite good too. BUT....I cannot believe Ms.Cornwell wrote Isle of Dogs. The worst of it all is that some critic has compared her new style with the brilliant black humour of Carl Hiassen. Sorry... but I entirely disagree. Hiassen together with Elmore Leonard are perfect in this style, and Patricia Cornwell, perhaps trying to copy it, has completely lost her shot. I feel very free to say it because I like Ms. Cornwell's books, but this narrative does not fit her style and Isle of Dogs is a disaster: bizarre but not funny; absolutely pathetic because you follow the building of an episope which should make you laugh and you just have to read it again just to find out that you're not the one who didn't understand the joke... it's just a bad joke!"
1,EEEEEK!,i have 3 words for those considering this book: Don't Do It!patricia cornwell is one of my favorite writers; this book is NOT representative of her work. let it go by. i wish i had read some reviews before purchasing this book. i cant get past page 25.
1,What a dog of a book!,"Let me preface this with the fact that I am an extremely avid Patricia Cornwell fan, but this book is absolutely, positively awful. She stuffs in between the chapters extraneous info about Jamestown and its history, but most of this info has nothing to do with the rest of the book. It was so frustrating that ended up skipping most of them after plodding through a few of them. It was just filler. This book was alleged to be humorous. I didn't laugh once. The characters weren't quirky, just annoying. It seemed all the characters had an IQ of 2.One other person who rated this book said it didn't have her voice. I agree. Even Dr. Scarpetta, who made a brief appearance, didn't sound anything like herself.I had force myself to finish this book, hoping against hope that it would get better. It didn't.I give this book no rating, (although Amazon forced me to choose between 1 and 5 stars). Don't buy it even if you find it on the remainder table for 50 cents."
1,How to waste (dollar amount),As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell I think this book was garbage. What were you thinking? I purchased this book for vacation reading and should have thrown it away when the trout and crabs started their conversation. Hoping it would improve I continued reading. What a disappointment! I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.
1,A dog of a book,Definately not worth the money or time to attempt to read this dog of fiction. Some reviewers seem to think it was an attempt at comedy. I found nothing to laugh at in the book other than the weak attempt at humor and a major departure from a style of writing that is enjoyable to read.
1,"Where have you gone, Kay Scarpetta?","Imagine my surprise, and soon, displeasure when I realized that what I have come to rely on in Patricia Cornwell's writing - that is, a fast paced, intelligent mystery - is non-existent in Isle of Dogs. If I wanted to read Carl Hiassen or Elmore Leonard, I would.Explanations of the governor's lower intestinal distress, Major Trade's lunacy, and this band of pirates are not only totally unbelievable, but frankly, not very interesting. Throw in the island residents, dental distress and the wacko wife and children of the governor, and what you have is a big waste of whatever you spend on this book.My advice is, don't."
1,"If you must read it, try the library!","Ok, first let me say that I truly enjoyed some of Patricia Cornwell's early books. Now for the hard part.....this was absolutely horrible. I am a book-a-holic, and barely finished this book. I wouldn't have at all if it weren't for the fact that I bought it at the airport for 26 dollars.....learned my lesson there....!Anyway, the book is somewhat disorganized, the plot totally outlandish, and is so poorly written that your mind will wander while reading it. There are so many plot lines going that you just don't know where you are going. Missing kidnapped dogs, serial killers, insane governors, plotting servants, and web columnists, any of these might have been an ok story line on its own, but put together it makes for a childish plot. If you want a good Cornwall book, check out some of her early stuff. If you insist on reading this, check it out at the library. And Ms. Cornwell, if you read this, I'm sorry, but stick to your earlier style!"
1,Isle of the Bored,"Without any debate this is a departure from her normal work and a very weak effort. It is hard to read, hard to follow, hard to understand and hard to figure out why Patricia thought this would be a good story. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Not her first book,"It's a good thing ""Isle of Dogs"" was not Patricia Cornwell's first book, because there likely would never have been a second, and the mystery genre would be infinitely poorer without Kay Scarpetta and Judy Hammer.I suppose you have to admire Cornwell for going out on a limb and trying a completely new style. Unfortunately, her try at a Dave Berry-style farcical romp fails miserably. A good comic writer can make a preposterous situation hilarious. Unfortunately, Cornwell only makes preposterous situations embarrasingly impossible.You can squirm through the first hundred or so pages, like I did, until you're convinced that it's only going to get worse. If you do, though, I recommend you handle the book carefully so it shows no visible signs of use, and you can return it to Costco and get your [money] back."
1,Waste of time,"Gee, I wish I had read the reviews before I ever read this book. In all honesty I did not read the book but listened to the audio book on CD that I got from the local library (I couldn't find anything else). Little did I know that this was an absolutely horrible piece of literature. I think it was mean to funny, but the humor was so forced and contrived was just so plain bad. The last coupele discs were scratched and skipped a lot, and in a way I am glad because I was able to get to the end faster. I have never read anything from this author before but I had heard she was good, after this book I'll never touch anything she has written with a 10 foot pole."
1,Just rubbish,"Spare your time and money. This is just rubbish. After already wanting to throw this book against the wall several times, I've got as far as the crabs that talk and decided that enough, is enough. Life's too short to read this. Don't start it, best way to avoid it."
1,"Would be ""0"" if I could","As so many others have already said, this book is absolutely terrible!! I don't know what possessed her to write this piece of garbage. She should stick to Scarpetta."
1,Wow! I'm not alone....,"I too wondered what drug Patricia Cornwell was on and actually twice shared that thought with my husband . I've read all of her other books and found them good but this was painfully disappointing. Trooper Truth? The speed plan on Tangiers island? The Governor? And the email exchange between Trooper Truth and Major Trader: "" ......I suggest you tell me what you know this minute. Don't make me warn you again. And where her owner lives is none of your business....."" Seriously??? I'm about to chapter 10 and think I'll trash the book and go purchase a magazine in the village to get me through until I return from vacation. Definately not recommended."
2,The worst book I've ever finished?,"I seriously contemplated giving this book a single star but decided that since I finished it - why I'm not sure! - it must have some redeeming quality.The official blurb describes this as a comic romp. Well at least I now know what it was supposed to be! I must admit part way through to thinking it must have been written as a comedy but, unfortunately, it seriously fails. This book just isn't funny. Excruciating? Yes! Abysmally written? Yes! Funny? Not a jot.I cannot comprehend how an author of this caliber could seriously write a book this bad. Does she believe that comedy means you throw out all rules of character, meter, pace and motive?Probably the worst thing is that this novel could have been great. It had some potentially great elements: Corruption in the Virginia governor's office, modern day pirates, a Chesapeake island who's inhabitants have their own language patterns and a severe distrust of the outside. What a waste."
1,Piling On,"I hate to pile on, but this book was so bad that it needs the maximum number of bad reviews. If an unknown author had submitted the manuscript to a reputable publisher it would not have been printed.Trooper Truth was obnoxious.The people of Tangier Island were dissed as were nearly every citizen of Virginia. Cornwell should be run out of the state.If you like low high camp - buy the book. No. Save your money and waste your time and check it out of your local library."
2,Very Disappointed by this Hammer/Brazil book.,"Let me say, I am a new Cornwell reader. I have read a few of her Scarpetta Novels and the two previos books in this series. I was very disappointed by this entry.It lacks what made the first two books of this series interesting, The intertwining of the three main characters. As a matter of fact, Deputy West is not in the book and is only mentioned once. Cornwell forces the humor in this book when in the previous two, the humor was more subtle. The minor characters are too over the top and in this book unbelieveable. And finally, while these books are not on the same level with the KS novels, the main thing that made them work for me is lacking. As I said before the interplay between the three main characters is missing.If you do want to read the books of this ""side"" series, stay away from this one. Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross are better."
1,Why Bother,"This book was written with little reference to Dr. Scarpetta and had references to dialog not necessary to book. Whatever has happened to Patricia Cromwell? She needs HELP before writing another book. It appears she had to put something on paper for her publisher by a certain date and just wrote a bunch of garbage to fill the pages. Don't get me wrong, I truly love most of her other books and anxiously await each new one, but this one's story is lacking."
1,The author can do much better - and has,"Patricia Cornwell is usually an excellent storyteller, and her characters and plots are well-crafted. The main characters in this novel have appeared in earlier books as somewhat quirky but fundamentally intelligent and capable professionals. By setting them down in the farcial situation she creates in ""Isle of Dogs,"" Cornwell gives them no choice but to become farcial themselves, their intelligence diminished and their training of no use. By allowing her characters to lose their earlier identifies, they become mere puppets in a bad play. If you've never read Patricia Cornwell, don't buy this book; if this is only Cornwell you've read, don't judge her by this dismal effort."
1,Gone to the Dogs,"I have also bought all of Cornwell's books in hard cover and saved them - This book was on my Christmas list and I couldn't wait to read it. I got half way through when I decided it was not a matter of ""getting into"" the book. The book is just horrible. It is not funny nor clever bor absurd...just stupid! What a waste of my son's money!!"
1,Cornwell Needs to Stick to Kay Scarpetta,"I have read everything Patricia Cornwell has written and I have thoroughly enjoyed each one, even though the Hammer books are not my favorites.Isle of Dogs was a dog, in my opinion. It's only purpose was to poke fun at people and had no story line that I could determine other than speaking of the bowels of the Governor at every oportunity.I will continue to read Cornwell only if she returns to the forensic theme."
1,I feel that I've been had.,"After having read the other reviews, I have little to add.I , too, did not read it through. Her other books, with one other exception, keep me up through the night.I just removed my book mark, placed it with those to go to my used book store, and felt taken.She owes it to us to warn us before we buy them when she knows, full well, that we are to be disappointed with her ""wild hairs"".I've sworn off before, due to the sadness seeping from the soul of the Doctor. She surely must recover sometime from her lost love.Is our dear author like this in her own soul? I trust not.She's such a talent."
5,great...made me laugh so hard,"this book made me laugh so hard and was so throughly enjoying my entire family had to finally see what I was reading. I have always enjoyed all her novels but this was GREAT. Please keep this series going. There so many great people inclued I was in my glory. MOses custard ,I had to hold my ribs together. Please this is a side I,ve never seen before. Please continue."
1,Gone to the Dogs,"Farce is not Ms Cornwell's forte. If you have read other Cornwell's and loved them, as I had, please save yourself the time and disappointment by simply not bothering with Isle of Dogs. It is bad.If I had never heard of Ms Cornwell I would have thought this to be a first novel and vanity published.The plot is weak, the characters absurd and the whole novel is an insult to a reader's intelligence and Cornwell fans' loyalty.If I could have rated lower than 1 star it would have given me pleasure to award this a -5."
2,I can't take this too seriously,"The book starts out great. Interesting and quick moving. Then something happens! I realize that I am no longer interested in these characters or what happens to them. I do like Hammer and Brazil. They are the best characters in the book. It's silly and not even funny if that's where Cornwell was going with this. I am a serious Cornwell fan and have read all her books and I was disappointed in this book. She is known for her detail,descriptiveness and emotion and I didn't find any of those in this book."
1,Not a pleasant experience...,"I must say that I've enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's previous books, so I was looking forward to this (particularly due to the comparisons to Carl Hiaasen).It was an incredible disappointment - it was the first book in recent memory that I finally had to give up on halfway through. And the only book in my life that I have ever seriously considered trying to return for my money back.The storyline was incomprehensible (even after 200 pages), none of the characters were likable or even interesting. Even the 'protagonist' Andy was an annoying 'too good to be true' know-it-all.I suggest you save your money and purchase Ms. Cornwell's earlier works or try Carl Hiaasen if you're up for some dark comedy."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I was an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell and especially loved her Dr. Scarpetta character. Isle of the Dogs was one of the worst books I've ever read. I was insulted and offended by the characters, their situations and reactions to each other. The writing was unbelievable and I kept thinking no one can be this stupid. The plot was predictable and you could see every event coming. None of the characters had any depth. I've given up on Patricia Cornwell and I'm off to find a new favorite author."
2,Suprised,Southern Cross was a sad take off from Hornet's Nest. Isle of Dogs was a sadder take off from Southern Cross.The comedy was out of character for Cornwell. I'd like to see more on Virginia West rather than any more of Andy Brazil.
1,Do not buy,This book is terrible. I did not even finish it. If you like her Kay S. series stay away from this book.
1,The biggest literary disappointment of the year!,"I LOVE the author's Kay Scarpetta novels, so I was especially disappointed by this one...even tho' it started off suspensefully, it rapidly descended into an inane, deadly dull, hard to take work. Not to give anything away, but when the crabs in the pot began to voice their POV to the reader, I had to check the back cover to make sure that it was, in fact, an actual work of Cornwall's. What was she thinking!? What was I thinking by sticking with it to the bitter end--which was a challenge. There wasn't even a rewarding pay off. I'm sticking with Kay Scarpetta, who would be (if she weren't fictitious) embarrassed by her own cameo appearance in this turkey."
4,What a great novel!,"Gosh...I guess I suffer from first time thrills. See, I have never read a Cornwell novel until I bought Isles of Dogs at the gift shop at a resort in Hawaii. I had already read books by Patterson and Meltzer while bronzing on the beach (both were bad) and I picked out Patricia's book by pure happinstance. Her photo on the back cover was a selling point, by the way.In any event, I found the book funny, charming and entertaining.I'm a 53 year old trial lawyer from Southern CA and never heard of Tangier Island. Sure, the book is fantasy and fun, but this is mixed with dark humor in a very cool way. I am now a fan of Ms. Cornwell. Be careful out there!"
1,I wish I read the reviews first,"I am a Patricia Cornwell fan. 2 years ago while visiting my mom I had finished reading the book I had with me, desperate for more reading material I dug into a bag of books passed on to her from friends... ALAS... I selected Point of Origin... from then on I was hooked! Patricia has a talent that was not evident in this latest effort... Talking fish and crabs playing dead???? If this had been the book in the sack of loaners, I would never have become the fan I am today.Needless to say, I will wait for the reviews from now on or frequent the public library rather than risk a purchase....."
1,What WERE you thinking?,"What a disappointment! Corny, unimaginative, and boring are too kind of words to describe this book from one of my favorite authors! (Next time, I'll read Amazon reviews BEFORE I purchase the book). While reading I could not rid my brain of scenes from Rocky Raccoon cartoons! Of course, it's a best seller: We were all expecting the 'usual' great mystery from Ms. Cornwell. I guess the joke's on us."
1,"So Bad, I Threw it on the Floor!","I agree with 480 of the other 500 reviewers. I have read just about every Patricia Cornwell novel. A while back, I remember thinking that Hornet's Nest, a departure from the Kay Scarpetta series, was just not as good. Why, why, why didn't I remember that when I shelled out my hard-earned dollars for this abomination? One night recently, I picked up Isle of Dogs for the third time, got to about page 75 (yes, I lasted that long!) and threw the book on the floor. My poor slumbering wife was startled from her sleep, and I heaped my indignation on her. I'm sorry , honey."
1,Not Even for Dogs,"This is a disaster. I have admired and enjoyed Cornwell's books, but this effort is a catastrophe, the editor should be shot, and the publisher ashamed. Her brand of scatalogical humor went out in Junion High School. A major theme is a Govenor's Press Secretary feeding him chocolate cookies laced with ExLax, followed by lengthy descriptions of the result in graphic detail. This is for adolescents who want to gross out adults. Badly written and badly conceived, Cornwell is the reverse of the Clown who wants to play Hamlet. The loving descriptions of sadism do not help. Awful!"
1,Isle of Dogs,I was very disapointed. I have been a great fan of Patricia Cornwell and have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta collection. As I was reading this book I wondered if the same person had done the writing. The plot moved around so fast you could not get to know the characters or care about them. The attempts at humor fell flat for me. I also think the book was an insult to the people of Virginia that they would elect a Govenor with no leadership ability and such a disfunctional family. Again if this was supposed to be humorous it fell flat. Thank You.
3,Different expectations,"Since I'd never read anything else by Cornwell, I guess I had different expectations than the other reviewers I see here. I enjoyed the book -- actually chuckled out loud quite a few times. It certainly won't win the Pulizer, but I found it entertaining. I loved the characters and the serendipity."
1,not even a chuckle,"I believe this was Cornwell's attempt at a black comedy, but I couldn't even muster a chuckle. It was horrible. I concur with previous reviews in that the plot wandered and when it got back ""on track"", the reader sure didn't know it. As an avid Cornwell fan prior to this read, I could never have imagined she was capable of writing such a thoroughly disappointing novel. She should stick with Scarpetta; that's why we all (used to?) read her anyway."
2,E for Effort,There is only one word for this book: Ridiculous. I have enjoyed Patricia's books for years but this one really missed the mark. Ms. Cornwell should stay away from humor. Fish and crabs talking? Give me a break. Don't buy it.
2,"Not her best, but kind of grew on me","I agree with Lynne D. Mellinger's review of Patricia Cornwell's recent attempt at humor. Most readers are totally turned off by Isle of Dogs because they expect a Kay Scarpetta novel. (I must admit that I didn't read the jacket blurb myself.) I initially thought that the book was stupid and had a totally improbably plot. I stuck with it, however, and I finally got the point. Towards the end I actually was beginning to enjoy the humor."
1,The Worst,"This is the worst book by Patricia Cornwell that I have read. I make that assertion after only 150 pages, as I am debating whether I will finish it, or even continue. She should stick withthe Kay Scarpetta character."
1,Sadly disappointed,I usually love Patricia Cornwell's books and eagerly awaited this newest book. I began the book and am sad to say I could not continue reading it ... let alone finish it ... only read about 25 - 30 pages and had to put it down. Sure hope Ms Cornwell returns to her original writing style ... Kay Scarletti where are you?
1,Gag...,"This was a comedy? I honestly couldn't even tell it was supposed to be...it made me think of something a 6th grader would have written in Creative Writing. I have no idea who the hero or villain is supposed to have been as many characters seem stupid and evil but none are remotely likeable. There is an asinine relation drawn between each of the characters that is far beyond the realm of believability, yet not interesting enough to be funny. I have read almost every other Patricia Cornwell novel and am a big fan especially having lived in Richmond once, but I am severely disgusted by this book. This may be the last Cornwell novel I ever pick up. I appreciate that challenge of staying fresh, but Patricia Cornwell really ""jumped the shark"" with this one. She's lucky if she isn't sued by the residents of Tangier Island for her abuse of their home and culture in this cruel joke. This is an insult to Cornwell's loyal readers and a phenomenal waste of time."
2,Stick with Scarpetta,"I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's books and have even read all three of the ""Hammer and Brazil"" books. They haven't been as interesting as the Scarpetta books, but have been somewhat entertaining. Isle of Dogs was a little ""out-there,"" but was still entertaining. The Hammer and Brazil characters could have been developed a lot more and the multiple plots could have been pared down a bit. It took a while to get into, but the last 100 pages were fun."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have read all but three of Patricia Cornwell's books. I have found their scientific approach appealing as well as the way Ms. Cornwell wraps the storyline. I find it hard to believe that Isle of Dogs was written by the same author. I am not completely sure what the central story was about because there were so many detours. At one point, there was a conversation between trout and crabs. I knew at this point that there was little hope in the quality of the book improving. The book was not only dull, but way below the quality of novel I have read from Ms. Cornwell in the past. It was very disappointing!!"
1,Thanks for the tip,"I was on page 34 when I decided to find out what Amazon readers were saying about this book. After reading just five of the reviews, I have decided not to waste my time, which is really too bad, because I have been waiting several months for this book! Southern Cross was funny, but this book so far has been just plain stupid Windy Brees....give me a break!"
1,Buy it used,"Patricia Cornwell is always worth reading, but I recommend that you buy this book used. Her story lines bounce between what characters (including fish) are thinking and what is really happening to the character using vague allegories involving elevators, submarines and faithful mini horses. Even Trooper Truth can't seem to stick to the subject. The only thing that is clear is her love for helicopters."
1,Disappointed Reader,"Like so many others who have written reviews for this book, I am an avid Patrica Cornwell reader. This book indeed is a departure from her other books. I am just a little over halfway through it and have to force myself to pick it up and read another chapter. This book makes me think that Cornwell dusted off one of her first attempts and got it published because of her reputation. I cannot believe a publisher would have accepted this book if submitted by an unknown author. NOT an enjoyable read!"
1,I give up!,"OK -- I tried. I've read all the others, and this is the first time I've ever been motivated to write a review. This book does not rate of ""review""; it's definitely a ""pan""! I got to page 121 and said ""enough!"" Patricia Cornwell had us all entranced for book after book, and then she decided to do something else. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even someone who's never read Cornwell. Satire is one thing; spoof is another; silly doesn't follow either. (I haven't read any of the other reviews on this site. Now I'm going to read them. I presume they'll 90% agree with me. If not, maybe I should give up reading.)"
1,Patricia Cornwell is no Carl Hiaasen,"I saw no humor in Isle of Dogs whatsoever. Her characters are not at all funny but fit into the cagetory of: Lame-brained, stale, banal, inane, slow-witted, etc., etc. What happened to ""witty"" humor. The typical reader has a better IQ than 3.Carl Hiaasen must be insulted.Audrey Smith"
1,What a total waste of money,"I bought this in an airport to read on a flight and with nothing else to read, STILL couldn't read past page 50. This book is truly awful. Cornwell may know forensics but a comic writer she is NOT...I wish no stars were possible in this review, but as it is, one HAS to give at least one star."
1,Too Bad for the Trees,It's too bad that all of those trees were cut to print this waste of time. I couldn't even finish it.
1,a kidnapping?,"This is a book about a kidnapping... many might assume I'm talking about the rotten dentist who is held on the island by his patients after they discover what dreadful things he has done to their teeth. But, I'm talking about the apparent kidnapping of one of my favorite authors, Patricia Cornwell. The Patricia Cornwell I'm talking about always drew praise for the reality of her work--the detail that took you into the story and made you believe you were there. I'm afraid that my kidnapping explanation is much more believable than the talking seafood and a dog that can read and type on a computer. If anyone hears of the safe return of my favorite author, please let me know and I will again feel compelled to read anything new that appears with her name. Until that time I just hope that she has not been harmed."
1,Sometimes a Publisher Should Just Say NO,"I don't care if a revered author finally DOES dedicate a book to you. That's not rationale for a publisher and friend (as Cornwell calls her in the dedication) putting out a book so obviously banged out in a few days to meet a deadline. Calling it a ""dark comedy"" is an extreme kindness. The characters don't even rate as parodies. If you love stupid slapstick, this might work for you, but I have the feeling few true mystery readers do."
1,Best use - lining the litter box,"This has to be the worst book I've read in the past ten years. Maybe the author was trying to mimic Lundlum's ""The Road to Gandolfo"", but after 100 pages, I was ready to kick myself for wasting my time reading such drivel.If only the pages were larger, I'd use it to line my cat's litter box."
1,It has never taken me so long to read a book,"I can't believe how long it is taking me to finish this book. This book has to be a joke. I am on page 289 and I am about to give up. There are too many characters to keep track of. Though it is somewhat humorous, I think the talking fish and crabs are taking it a bit too far. I am about to give up and put this book down. I am really disappointed in this work of hers."
1,Isle is a big tease,"The book does not live up to our expectations of this author. Although, elements of the story line offer some hope, they ultimately are disappointing and go nowhere. The resolution of the book was unsatisfying and appeared as if Corwell just ran out of steam. This book is a DOG.."
1,Why force yourself to finish a book,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and eagerly awaited this one. What a disappointment. At first I kept reading thinking that at some point it would begin to make sense and finally decided that no one was forcing me to finish this and put it aside thinking I would start again another time. The book still sits on my shelf, unread, and probably never read. Does anyone want to buy a ""like new"" copy?"
1,Stick to Scarpetta,"This book is a mess. It never takes off, the plot is jumbled and incomprehensible, and the characters are sadly unbeleivable. Cornwell is trying to be Carl Hiaasen, but ends up like a bad junior high school creative writing assignment.Pick any Kay Scarpetta novel, avoid this one. If you want good crime/comedy, read Hiaasen."
1,Stranded on Isle,"I agree with other readers. This is not Patricia Cornwell's forte. I suggest she leave the dark comedies to Carl Hiaasen.Give us Judy, Andy AND Kay back again, though."
1,A Doggy Book for Sure,Very disappointing. I have enjoyed Ms. Cornwell's books in the past however the last three that I tried to read have not been to her earlier standards. I struggled through Black Notice but gave up trying to read The Last Precinct. There are simply TOO many impausible events in this attempt at humor. Shame on Ms. Cornwell and double-shame on her editor who let this attempt slip into publication.
1,Ouch!,"I am a huge fan on Cornwell's work, especially the Kay Scarpetta series. However this was awful. Try as I might I just couldn't finish it.Please Patricia, stick what you know best..."
1,A DOG - FOR CERTAIN!,"I have for many years enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's work, this book, however, is a real disappointment. Stick to the formula that works! Kay Scarpetta is a believable character. None of the characters in Isle of Dog's are the least bit interesting or believable. The entire premise is ridiculous, disjointed and not fitting in an otherwise enjoyable body of work. Better luck on the next novel."
1,Black humor ? More likely a brain tumor!,"If ever a book deserves a zero---THIS IS IT!! I feel angry that I actually paid for this dismal failure and positively retarded to have invested the time it took to read it! I kept reading it (even though it took over a week to make myself finish it) because I was dumbfounded with the horribly inept writing style. It seems incredible that the person who wrote her previous novels also wrote this book. I noticed that there appears to be tears in her eyes in the photo on the back cover. If I had the talent and skill reflected in her previous works and this waste of trees is the best I could produce, I would cry as well. Then again, perhaps it was tears of shame for ripping off her loyal readers. It will be the last book written by Ms. Cornwell that I will purchase or waste my time reading. I don't think it was an attempt at black humor--- more likely a brain tumor! Please, for your health and safety, Ms. Cornwell get a complete neurological workup at once!"
1,Isle of Dogs,"I own every book that Patricia Cornwall has written, including her last one. It will by MY last one. It is a cross between ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" and a Dean Koontz novel, both of these being far superior to Isle of Dogs. I can not say how utterly disgusted I am with myself for having purchased such tripe. I regret having to give it even one star."
1,Waste of paper,"I'm a Cornwell fan. That said, this book is awful. Apparently no one in Virginia is capable of speaking proper english. That includes the talking blue crabs.The device of essays posted on a website only serves to distract. The protagonist is incredibly dull and lacks the depth of scarpetta at al. Hold out for the next Scarpetta book."
1,"...only because I couldn't select ""Zero Stars""!","Others have said it better, but I just feel so cheated by Ms Cornwell. I have thoroughly enjoyed her Kay Scarpetta mysteries and I don't remember Hornet's Nest being of this ilk, but Isle of Dogs is really cr*p. There's no other word for it. Was she trying to be Douglas Adams? If so, she failed by a country mile. Was she on drugs? It certainly comes over that way. Unfortunately, I'm the sort of person who refuses to put a book down once I start it--how I wish I weren't! I've now just started Southern Cross, and it looks like more of the same. Come on, Patricia, we all know you can do better than this."
1,What a Disaster,"I am a passionate Cornwell fan - but this book almost changed that. The intertwined plot was silly - a speed trap on Tangier Island, a character with supernatural powers - and I found myself bored. There are some wonderful characters, but they are drowned in the heavily contrived story. Regretfully, I bought this book in hardcover."
2,Isle of Dogs is a dog.,"After reading all of Patricia Cornwell's previous works, I was looking forward to this latest book. I should have saved my money and time. Her previous works were marked by scientific accuracy and suspense. This book is totally unbelieveable and is seriously marred by hocus pocus and nonsense. If you must read it, get it at the library or wait for the paper back version."
2,what a mess,"I eagerly awaited new characters as I grew tired of Dr. Scarpetta in the last book. That book was all about feeling sorry for oneself and reviewing everything that happened in earlier books. What a waste.However, Isle of Dogs is so boring. I read about a third, then decided to check Amazon to see if I was missing something. Seems about everyone agrees with me. Some of the humor is interesting. Especially since it is new for Cornwell. The plot is so silly. Cornwell's first four books were great. After that, beats me what happened."
1,Less Than 1 star,"I assume this book was meant to be humorous, however it is no joke. If it were possible to rate lower than 1 star.....the plot is nonsense, and the dialogue banal. There is nothing ""funny"" here except the irony of paying good money for one horrible book."
1,Cornwell wrote this?,"I am a big Patricia Cornwell fan and love her writing style but there are two of her books I would recommend avoiding - this one and ""Portrait of a Killer"". ""Isle of Dogs"" was by far one of the worst books I've ever wasted time reading. I thought the plot was pretty hokey and the characters were laughable. It's hard to believe Cornwell actually wrote this book. The only reason I made it to the end of the book is that I was reading it on the commuter bus on the way home from work....now I realize that sleeping would've been more entertaining."
1,What was Patricia thinking?,"Talking crabs and talking trout, need I say more. The book reveals only shallow descriptions of the characters and an overabundance of plot lines (i.e. the governor's wife and her trivets, the fraudulent dentist and his kidnapping, the bungling trooper who flies the govenor and family, the rambling essays of Trooper Truth, the kidnapping of Popeye the dog, oh, and then the actual crime storyline). As if to further confuse and put-off the reader she adds backward talking islanders who are portrayed to have the brains of 5th graders. I began reading this book with an open mind and perused eagerly through the first Trooper Truth essay excited to see where his ""from left field"" comments were headed, but was disappointed to find out that the essays lead nowhere. I can say that I finished the book, but it was a chore and I will think twice before buying her next book even though I have devoured all of her previous novels."
1,Isle of Dogs,"Yikes, I couldn't even finish it. I loved her earlier works, even the non-Scarpetta books were enjoyable. I can understand how she might get sick of her characters as many authors do and as she's obviously done with the Scarpetta series and I'm grateful she just took a break instead of killing the rest of those charaters off, but this is just awful. Someone please tell her she's not funny. Flat characters and bad tempered stabs at humor, don't bother, wait for the next one."
1,Stick to Forensics,"I could not complete the book...a rarity for a Cornwell novel. I bought the audio book for this, and went through 3 tapes complete believing it had to get better, and then tried to get to better sections, but finally gave up.Start with characters: most of them unbelievably morons...too extreme for public officials & professionals...and that's not easy to say.Trooper Truth Monologues.....go on and on and on in most cases.In most cases, what do they have to do with the ""trooper"" idea?They sound like methods to just expound upon some personal research: ""Patricia...write a non-fiction book instead, please!""Plot: oh yeah...I got real excited about such a quick ""secession"" over 1 1/2 striped lines...plot - best place 6 feet down under. And the killings....no development...no reason...6 feet under also!Stick to your forensic tales, Patricia. Most of them have been GREAT! Let Judy Hammer tales die!"
2,Disappointing Effort From a Favorite Author,"Sadly, of all this author's books I've read, this was the most disappointing. The plot was uneven. The connections between the characters were weak. The book felt disjointed and the attempts at humor fell far short. I did not like the character developement of Andy or Judy Hammer. It was disappointing.I did get through it because I was loathe to quit and kept wishing for a strong ending that would help it make sense. Alas, it was not there.My apologies to Ms. Cornwell whose work I have always enjoyed tremendously. Your work has educated and even moved me in the past. I will not give up! I will remain a loyal fan and hope for the better we all know you are capable of."
1,I wish the scale would let me rate this a negative 5,"I have never written a review before but this book was so bad I just have to vent. I am a great supporter of Patricia Cornwell and have read (and own) every book she has written. I fell in love with Cornwell's books because they were intelligent. I have to admit that I like the earlier books more than the latest. The focus of the earlier books was putting the pieces together to solve the puzzle while later books have focused on dysfunctional relationships and writing thrillers. In spite of that change, I still continued to buy each new Cornwell book because, as unbelievable as the story line might be, there was still a thread of intelligence. However, this is just about the straw.Isle of Dogs is stupid. The characters are stupid. The storyline is stupid. It's almost like it was written to dumb it down for the readers. Maybe stupid is funny but not when stupid me paid real money on this book. I will not make that mistake again with this author."
1,Cornwell gets corny,"Having read most of her books it's hard to believe that she hadanything to do with this one. The first few pages would lead oneto believe that this could be a great read. Unfortunately the plot(is there a plot?)and the characters are so unbelieveable.The dialogue reeks of a 12 year old with a creative writing assignment. Maybe it's all a joke on us, perhaps this was a comedy. I feel bad for Kay Scarpetta. She got dragged into the this poor excuse for a novel and came off looking like an idiot as well. If by chance you read this book and can't get beyondpage 50, do yourself a favor and read an earlier work. I wouldsuggest ""Potter's Field"" as a good place to start.A short note to her editor. You should be fired!!!"
1,My Dog Writes Better Than This!,"After reading all of Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta series, I was obviously overly excited at purchasing this book before carefully reading its contents. From the ridiculous character names to the lame attempt at creating any type of coherent storyline, this book was an all out failure."
4,Wardman's work offers fantastic insight.,"For those who's aquantance with ancient Rome could be described as introductory, Wardman offers steeped insight to the relation of religion and the State. He paints with a relatively broad brush in order to span the Roman experience, but still manages to offer keen specifics to support his points of interest. As you make your way through the text, Wardman slowly demonstrates how the texture of Religion in Roman society shifted throughout the centuries of it domination. Most importantly, Wardman addresses the misconceptions put forth by prior scholars with regards to civic polytheism being replaced by monotheistic Christianity. He clearly demonstrates that the process has a clear precedence in Roman history and also revels the miscues of past historians who claimed that civic polytheistic 'faith' died out due to its inability to respond the the religious needs of individuals."
3,Okay but there's better,"I never saw what is so big about this song, but it is half decent. If you're looking for something to dance to... try Stardust."
4,satisfaction,I don't live in America. But I am satisfied with the short time delivery. And this book can realize God's love toward me. I hope anybody who long for God will read this surely.
4,Incredible talent and catchy songwriting!,"I recieved this album first as a promotional item through the recording company, and upon first listening I didn't find it particularly appealing. I thought it was too dark, and I didn't think the melodies were very catchy. A few years later, I decided to listen to the album again to see if my opinion of the album would change considering my perspective had changed over the years. The more I listened to the album the more I came to appreciate the production, the songwriting, and even found myself humming those very melodies which I found unattractive before. Now I am a definite fan of Harcourt's music and I am recommending to most of my friends that they buy his music and so should you!"
2,Mediocre at best,"I was very dissapointed in this CD and do not recommend it. The songs are uninspired and don't compare to other artist/material in the genre. I forced myself to listen to it several times to give it the benefit of the doubt.....no use. Invest your money in other artist. Like another reviewer noted, the best songs are the first five and they are mediocre at best."
4,A lengthy erotic masterpiece.,"Casting Couch isn't really a movie. It basically stars Holly Sampson as a casting agent who tells little stories about aspiring actresses who do some naughty things to get into a movie. The results are some truly steamy and very explicit sex scenes that are among the most erotic I've seen to date (rivaling those in Femalien and Alien Files). Yeah, the lighting often stinks and the audio is pretty bad, but these scenes work as the uninhibited fantasies they are. The standout scene is probably the one between the Brits, a very graphic scene that almost crosses the line to hardcore (and the raven-haired woman in this scene is extremely hot). The unbearably pretty Holly Sampson gets a very explicit masturbation scene, coming at the very end, which might be a long wait for her fans, since this movie runs over 2-and-a-half hours!"
4,Still in search of the Gullah Island,"I read this book after reading Llaila Olela Afrika's ""African holistic Health."" Although Afrika failed to provide much information (I read the book but I am still glueless as to where the Gullah Islands are-- exactly and why they are a people blessed by God) he succeeds in engendering a sense of wonder in the reader. If you never considered a trip to the Gullah Islands you probably will after reading this book."

If you never considered a trip to the Gullah Islands you probably will after reading this book."
3,Not the best but ok for the price,"Just like the title says, the mirror is an ok deal for the price. As stated in other reviews, you must constantly readjust the mirrors when you're driving. I drove from San Francisco, Ca. to Vancouver Canada and back. I gave up on readjusting the mirrors on the drive up. Basically I was able to use them by looking at the mirrors from different angles. I was only carrying a camper and not towing so this was ok for me. I saw the same mirror at a local Walmart for $25 so at $17 this is a better deal. If I had to do it over again I would read more reviews and spend more for a better mirror, but this did get the job done."
2,Adjustments required all the time,"Great idea for a mirror. But, I put it on a 2008 Tundra and the mirrors need to be re-adjusted every time you open and close the door as well as after short periods of time while driving. Too much tolerance as a universal mirror I guess. I do like the two mirror idea...but way too much continuous adjustment required on my truck to recommend them."
2,Watch for fit problems,"If your vehicle's mirrors are a stationary fairing or housing with a pivoting mirror inside, you need to make sure that the mirror is well recessed in the housing on both top and bottom. The clips in the arms of this mirror need to extend into the housing about 1/4 inch, and they are fairly thick.When attached to the mirror on my 2008 Pathfinder it restricts the adjustment of the Pathfinder's mirror, forcing it to point down as the mirror is nearly flush with the housing on the bottom edge. I also found vibration to be a problem, perhaps partially due to the problems with the fit.On the plus side, it appears to be well constructed with plenty of adjustment in the straps, and my fit issues may affect other brands as well."
3,Good in theory,"I picked these towing mirrors because I thought the wide angle part would be helpful, as I have them on my truck mirrors. However, the main part of the mirror is too small and shakes too much. They were useable but still too shaky. Also having four mirrors (truck mirror, truck convex mirror, ""small"" shaky towing mirror and towing convex mirror) so close together was distracting. I've picked a bigger (5 x 7) full faced regular view towing mirror instead."
3,Pretty-good book,"Like most R&D books, it's overpriced. It does have a lot of good code, however. And the text is very easy to folow."
4,"Great singing and band , but similar styles can get boring","I'll take a chance here and say that most listeners will come to this album after getting a taste for Sam's style and maybe hearing most or all of his big hits .This is not an album for dancing , as the songs aren't romantic in the least .This album does set and maintain a mood - we had it playing in the car the other night and it was perfect for that time .However , there is not a lot of diversity in the songs and that was one of the great things about Sam .The last song is a departure and almost feels out of place - nothing leads up to it gently .The sound is wonderful but I recommend you listen to it at a record shop first to see if you like the whole thing ."
5,A Classicq,"I got a number of other albums by Sam, but this was is the best, it's amazing what a man can do, his voice, his charm, he still has it all. If some people are not sold on this album, buy it and you will be. All 12 songs are great, Little Red Rooster, Shake Rattle and Roll are great. It's an all time classic. Thanks Sam where ever you are."
3,"Great album!! well, it used to be","Even though he is more known for sweet poptunes like 'Cupid', 'Chain Gang' and 'Wonderful World' he has also recorded some albums which shows his more blues- and jazz interests.Night Beat is by far his best album. An album in the sense that is has the same sound, a good mix of songs and not just a collection of singles and filler.This album is now remastered but unfortunately this edition shows that that is not always a good thing. It is not a pleasure to listen to because of a hiss. They also meddled in the tracklisting, it doesn't start with the beautiful, very light 'Lost and Lookin' anymore.As a previous reviewer said: get the 2001 version of this great classic soul album."
4,2 LEGENDARY STARS IN A SO-SO FILM,"December 28 1989 I first saw this film and became an instant fan of RIVER PHOENIX. Teamed with great Sidney Poitier it is a cold-war thriller and at times - a good one. But in the end it goes over the top and it quickly lost its importance when the cold war vanished... soon after the films completion...However, it is a treat for the fans of these stars and the supporting cast are great especially Caroline Kava."
1,A real turkey,"Fortunately, I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I like Sidney Poitier and saw River Phoenix in ""The Mosquito Coast"" years ago, so I thought the teaming of the two actors would be wonderful. I like stories of espionage and intrigue as well. This film, however, was a huge disappointment. I wasn't for one moment convinced that Jeff's parents were Russian spies, that Sidney Poitier was an FBI agent or that the older Russian guy was a real threat. In addition, River Phoenix's character isn't very likable and it's so obvious that River Phoenix is acting. The plot is choppy and there are very few suspenseful scenes or thrills (I don't consider a car chase scene a thrill). Not recommended at all."
4,Another Naxos find,"It would be absurd to say that Artur Bliss was one of the great composers of his time, but this disc, boasting Naxos' fine sonics and superb playing by the Maggini Quartet and David Campbell, is highly recommended for lovers of English music in general and clarinet in particular."
1,Do not buy!!,I ordered the 12 pack of these... price was great...but they are hard as rocks! Do not order!
5,novak in top form in jeanne eagles,"I know very little about Jeanne Eagales so I was not able to judge Kim`s performance in light of the real Jeanne Eagles. Perhaps, that`s best since critics of the time didn`t care much for the film. Time however, I feel will prove that this was Kim`s most outstanding performance. She dominates the film and proves that she is not just a beautiful movie star, but a great actress as well."
4,THAT FOUR STARS: ONLY IF THESE TITLES ARE REMASTERED,"Kim Novak has been the most neglected of late Golden Age stars, and if, and only if, Columbia remasters these titles will this be a collection to buy and keep. Columbia has done a miserable job of cleaning up and mastering it's titles for DVD. Bell, Book and Candle, with it's gorgeous Technicolor cinematography by James Wong Howe, has only been available in a very dim print that does not do justice to his work."
3,Interesting performance!,"This was an interesting look at the Battle of Waterloo. It probably isn't presented in a fashion for those trying to understand the battle completely. Small skirmishing and parts of the battle are covered in a complicated format. This movie is probably for those who already have an understanding of the battle and want to get to different details. The fighting, cannonades and reenacting goes far in this movie. Sometimes I was puzzled by why the I felt that the director used the same scene several times such as cannon fire scenes or marching. From a grand scale this movie never portrayed large armies massing together which made me disappointed to see. This movie has great action, though is far too brief on the subject matter making Waterloo appear as a small skirmish."
2,Good songs - his voice not for my taste,"I bought this album based on the positive thoughts I read on this page. I'm sad to say I was disappointed. I've trying to listen to this record hoping that it gets better through more hearing, but it just doesn't. His voice just simply is not for my taste. I've bought some other records by artists unknown to me (Chayanne, Cristian and Alejandro Fernandez) according to good reviews by Amazon customers. As opposed to those, this was a disappointment"
1,AWFUL!,"I don't know how anyone could think this is good music. If you are aware of the great bolero singers of the past, you should think he(Zaa)is a whining little kid that came out of the womb not too long ago. No experience, no idea what he's singing about, excruciatingly awful voice. Truly one of the worse cd's I have ever heard."
2,Good Voice --Needs his own style,Charlie Zaa has a good voice... Has the potential to be a great singer... He needs to develop his own style of voice.
4,Very surprised,I had seen the other Bruce Lee impersonators before and never liked there movies but I got this cause it was cheep and thought I would try it. Champ against Champ is a very good movie. It is a little cheesy but just the right amount of cheesiness to be funny and not annoying. If all the movies where as good as it I would give it 5 stars. The other 3 movies are good too but just not as good as Champ against Champ. Dragon Lee is by far the best Bruce Lee impersonator ever.
4,Good manual,"Has all the info I need, haven't found any inaccuracies yet. Some information is not TOO easy to find but it's hard to think of things that are NOT covered. Especially has a complete set of wiring diagrams, although an index for those 220 pages of wiring diagrams would have been nice! I made my own, after getting tired of browsing every time."
5,Great Colored Pencils,"I've always liked Prismacolor pencils and why wouldn't I LOVE this set for only a penny? They're great for travel, and on the go because they're a small set that I can throw in my purse and take with me any where."
4,Fond Childhood Memories,"Today, if I don't know the answer to a question, I have online search engines at my finger tips. My copy of ""Still More Tell Me Why"" is soon to be given away, because it is old and has developed an odor. Be careful if buying; I don't think you'll find physical copies that don't smell musty. When I was a kid (pre-internet), these books were so great!Let me remember -- Why do trees have bark? (p15) What is the difference between a spring and an artesian well? (p74) What makes a wind? (p101) Why do we sleep? (p295) How did pins originate? (p340) What is an atom smasher? (p402) -- Questions answered about ""The World We Live In"", ""Our Body and What Happens to It"", ""Other Living Things"", ""What Things Are and How They Work"", and ""How Things Began"".If I had a choice between giving a child this book or letting them use the internet, the internet wins. I think this modern era makes these books of little value, unless you are into strict parental controls or don't have internet access."
5,Exciting and Entertaining - A Must Read!,"In A Wind Through Paradise, Harmyk introduces an immediacy and a novelty to the world of suspense and political intrigue. Harmyk's writing style ushers you breathlessly from the opening pages to the very last, lending unique and very personal voices to all of his characters. As exciting a read as it is entertaining, A Wind Through Paradise comes highly recommended."
3,Sign me up for the Voodoo Academy!,"I had heard about this movie from one of the guys at work. he said this was a ""horror movie for the ladies"". As a woman I was interested, took it home and watched it. And liked it!It takes place at a Bible college, where a young Christopher Sawyer (Decoteau alum Riley Smith) is the newest student. But like all good religous schools, things aren't what they seem. Will Sawyer perish at the hands of the demonic Ms. Bouvier or live to go to grad school?The movie is very much for us women. The director gave his audience some of the best looking 20 somethings I have ever seen in a film. And they can act. The DVD includes over twenty more minutes than the VHS and with the resored footage, the movie works. See it."
2,I Never Thought...,"I never thought you could EVER have too many boys in underwear touching themselves in a movie, but I've seen porn plotlines that move faster than this movie.Great rental, but not worth owning.Oh, and one other little thing that bugged me. How many ""Bible Schools"" do you know of where ALL the boys are wearing designer underwear?"
2,HAHAHAHAHAH,"This movie was extreamly stupid, but very funny. We just laughed though this hole movie. This was pretty much very soft porn. The hole time all the guys did was rub themselves or the priest rubbed them. The special effects sucked, they were probably better in the old bewitched episodes (the black and white ones!!). The acting was very bad, and this movie is very anticrist."
1,Wasted money,"In 24 years, I've wasted a lot of money on a lot of different things, but the ... I spent on Voodoo Academy was the most completely wasted of all my mistakes. This is headed for resale immediately. I'll feel guilty dumping it on someone else but I'm gonna do it anyway. None of the characters in the film have any depth or purpose. Some die--who cares? None of the actors can read a line. The thin plot could have been forgiven if the pace were reasonable, but it drags on like an earthworm crossing a sidewalk. Editing was terrible. Some reviewers refer to ""homoerotic scenes""--nonsense, there were no truly erotic scenes. If you still buy this, watch it with the sound off, it's much better that way. The hunks are more interesting if you can't hear them."
3,Lots of skivvies shots,"David DeCoteau has become somewhat notorious over the past three years for creating cheap, formulaic horror with heavy homoerotic overtones and lots of twentysomething male flesh. _Voodoo Academy_ is one of his first flicks in this vein, and like the rest of them. it features no scares or shocks, and relatively little blood. It does have plenty of unintentional laughs, though. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is awful, and the production values are cheap, cheap, cheap.Of course, none of this matters. If you're watching this -- or any of DeCoteau's recent horror movies -- you basically want to see half a dozen pretty young men walk around in nothing but their skivvies for about an hour and a half. The ""restored director's cut"" of _Voodoo Academy_ (on DVD) certainly delivers the goods, and for that matter, delivers them better than any of DeCoteau's other movies. It's no _Citizen Kane_ (heck, it's not even _Citizen Toxie_), but it gets the job done."
4,Boys in boxer-briefs!,"Don't expect much from this flick but totally campy fun and lots of eye-candy of smooth, buffed boys, and you'll love it too. It's a great twist to see the BOYS inexplicably running around in their underwear for a change.The confessional and the opening are probably the hottest bits; gotta love the Reverend! The bloopers are a hoot as well.The first two 'Brotherhood' movies are of a similar genre, but I didn't find them as entertaining as 'Voodoo.'"
2,where's the beef?,"This very B grade horror film left alot to be desired. Aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex, and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix, there wasnt much to make this unrated. If your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity, forget it! The nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin Klein undies. However, if your someone who likes to use your imagination, this might be for you. One good thing about this flick is a pre Charmed hottie Drew Fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies. If your a big Drew fan like me, it might be worth buying, utherwise go buy a playgirl."
3,Jesus Camp,"""Voodoo Academy"" is a campy horror movie by out Portland,Ore. director David DeCoteau. A young man finds himself at the uptight Carmichael Bible College--a place where the lead pastor blends Christianity with New Agey concepts,and that electricity will cleanse their souls. It turns out that the young men, in their purity, are being turned into voodoo dolls by the headmistress Miss Bouvier.""Voodoo Academy"" manages to throw in some interesting theological debates--but it's mainly young men, shirtless. Or in their undies. The frequent shirtlessness compensates for the lack of a coherent plot (or acting) David DeCoteau was aiming for the campy--and succeeds.Let Voodoo Academy cast a spell!"
4,"Enjoyable look back at confused, delusional and invincible youth","Being young has some great advantages: passion, belief in ideals and the ability to be inspired by heroes. Being young has lots of disadvantages: powerlessness, confusion, awkwardness, and a blinding need to belong. All of these things are captured in ""Hairstyles"" and not in an overly nostalgic or veneered way. Protagonist Brian grapples with his budding sexuality, his attraction to a girl who on the surface isn't what society deems desirable, his developing love of music, a need to belong, and the realization that life doesn't run smoothly for him, is friends or his family. It's complicated, and he's just discovering how that can feel.The book feels real whether or not it was our youthful reality. I found it quite enjoyable. The musical component could also be quite inspirational for someone who was too young to experience it at the time."
1,Trash,"I couldn't stand this book. It is filled with meaningless cussing and there is no real plot other than these people trying to grow up. They don't seem like they ever will because they are so self centered and morally vapid. This is like hanging around with the worst kids in school and looking forward to spending the rest of your life in prison.I can't believe I'm the only person who hated this book. That is why I'm reveiwing it. With so much fine literature out there on the same topic I don't know why anyone would waste their time with this. Why not read Joyce Carol Oates on adolescence where the girls who hang around with the bad crowd get hurt?Gretchen is a thoroughly disgusting character. She is basically a felon who continually gets away with agravated assault, which impresses her suitor who still rejects her for being fat. How dumb and sleazy can you get? I thought punks had more of a philosophy but I can't find a shred of even logic in this book."
2,so happy I'm not 16 anymore,"If you wanted to relive your uncomfortable mid teens and were into punk rock then this is for you. Beyond that, the book just goes nowhere."
3,punked,"This book is definitely for the younger crowd. High school and even mid-school kids will get it. Being an older adult I enjoyed it, but not one of my all time favorite YA books."
4,flashback to early 90's,"This book brought me back to the world of mixtapes, the misfits, flannel shirts, and combat boots. Hairstyles of the Damned filled me the bittersweet nostalgia, but also made me glad that I've moved beyond those drifting teenage years. As written by other reviewers, the story is typical teen angst, but the realistic voice and the central motif of music reflecting and creating identity helps this novel stand apart from many of the rest in the same genre.I'd recommend this one to fellow readers in their late 20's/ early 30's who'd like a light and occasionally touching and funny trip back to high school. After reading it, I passed the book along to a 10th grade student of mine who has recently become interested in 80's punk. This ""reluctant reader"" (as some might label him) read the book in two days and came back raving about it. As a result the local book store was quickly cleared out of copies."
4,"Jesus, so that's what boys were thinking","I picked this up in Barnes & Noble, flipped it open and started reading it. Four hours later, my eyes are smarting, the general manager is glaring at me, and I still can't stop reading this book.I'm not necessarily a fan of the ""coming of age"" genre, but reading about Brian and Gretchen was eerily like having a window into the adolescent mind of my best friend. 'And here was I, with an erection every ten minutes, and all she had to do was ask.'Anyhow, it's a great read, and I urge everyone to take a look at this quirky, depressingly familiar, wonderful book."
5,one of the best books ive ever read,"i was in my friends room searching through a box of gossip magazines and empty boxes of incence when i say this book. At first it was just the cover that made me pick it up, but after i opend the book and read the first 3 pages i had to borrow it. After that i was in love. i read hairstyles of the damned in only a few days. Everything about it is true. everything that Joe Meno says about being a teenager and high school, is all so true. Brians love with his best friend, his finding of the misfits, everything just seems to be your life when your that age. Hairstyles of the damned is got to be one of the best books ive ever read. The way that Joe wirtes as Brian is so beliveable. Its not watered down, its not the sisterhood of the traveling pants writing. this is a real kid. He cusses and thinks about sex and all of the stuff that really happends. Read this book. Just do it. Thanks"
5,Re/Search Comp,"Wow! I recommend this cd for anyone who likes ""Re/Search: Incredibly Strange Music Volume II"". RHAG should have been on that record."
5,The Pattern of Superperforming CEOs,"To my amazement and delight, I have found this to be the pattern of Superperforming CEO. Without a fundamental love for people and for the company, it is impossible to create the nuclear reactor of Superperformance. Robert Greenleaf has left us a monumental touchstone for the leadership pattern you will find in all the great leaders, from Ernest Shackleton to George Washington to Herb Kelleher. The servant leader is authentic, unselfconscious and emerges from within, from who someone is, not from some adopted style.Also readSuperperformance"
4,I'm a leader and I like this book,"My mentor and boss recommended this book and there were many books on the ""servant leadership"" topic.This book uses real stories to support the lessons."
3,Nothing new,"The idea of servant leadership isn't new to me. I thought this book was going to redefine how I looked at servant leadership but it didn't. However, it was still a good book. The author of this book actually coined the idea of servant leadership back in the early 1970's and he had devoted his life to the study of servant leadership.If you are going into any leadership position, this is a good book to look over, but not an essential."
3,Required reading,"I need to purchase this book for required reading for my Leadership class. The beginning of the book wasn't so bad, but as you continue to read the writer keeps repeating the same points as in the beginning."
4,Satisfied,I am still in the process of reading the book but it was in good shape and arrived one time.
1,Difficult to read,This is definitely not a page turner. No doubt there are some good truths in the book but the style of writing makes it difficult to remain interested.
1,"Fails during critical use, horrible support","The light would be great, but it fails during use. The light goes out inrtermittently and you have to shake it or jiggle it to get the light back on. I've tried 4 different types of batteries including Energizers and Duracells, same issue. The Inova website is horrible to navigate, heavy-handed and has no useful information except a flash page that gives a non-toll-free CT number whihc gets you a recording. I sent it in per instructions with the 5 buck warrantry fee, they sent it back a month later saying they couldn't replicate the problem. Of c ourse, it still does it. I'll stick with retrofitted LED Maglites. It's obvious Inova doesn't care about consumer sales very much now that their police ordersare bringing in the loads of cash."
1,"Terrible Video Quality, OK sound but only TEN MINUTES LONG!!","This video is only TEN MINUTES long and looks like it was shot on worse video quality than old VHS. It is like old home movies filmed in 60's or 70's. Definitely NOT DVD picture quality! But the shocker to me was the extremely short length.How abusive is that to charge $15 USD for a ten minute video of poor picture and just OK sound quality.I could kick myself for not reading the fine print technical details.SAVE YOUR MONEY. There are other much better titles on Bali to choose from made by better production companies.I intend to write a letter of complaint to the produce of this DVD that has their own website selling their travel videos. Boy, they sure sold me against buying any other of their products.CAUTION!!!!"
3,Mythos - 'Strange Guys' (Spalax),"'Strange Guys' was originally released in 1977 as it was the band's third lp. Not as good as their 1971 self-titled debut (see my review of that CD), but still very much worth a listen. 'Strange Guys' makes the transformation from their classic elaborate krautrock sound to more or less basic heavy rock. I know it may sound terrible, but believe me when I say that it most certainly isn't. Notice that there are several rather nice mellotron / synthesizer segments through out this CD reissue. All six tracks are decent,the most notable are probably ""Aeronaut"" and the rocking nine minute ""Backstage Fumble"". Believe that founder Stephan Kaske is the only original member on this record. Take a chance."
1,"CAUTION: 2 different groups named ""Mythos""","Perhaps they had the name first, as I see one of their albums dates back to 1971, but this group named ""Mythos"" is German, not to be confused with the Canadian duo that first released in 1996."
4,A little bit of everything,"I've been at their concert on 1998's Thanksgiving at the HOUSE OF BLUES in Boston and I have to admit - It was an excellent session, lots of drive, energy, fun. I was a bit disappointed when I purchased the CD - I think if recorded live , they would have sounded fresher. Music on the CD is a bit slow for me, however the great diversity of musical styles, cultures,instruments and languages still makes BABALOO a worthwile to listen at anytime. I look forward to get their second CD."
5,Love Punk Mambo,"Just have to say that this is some of the funnest music I have ever heard. This CD was recommended to me by a friend. In fact, tomorrow I am going to see Babaloo live in NYC! Can't wait because I know it will be a blast. You should buy Babaloo."
4,excellent,"I first had this book read to me in class, in pre-published format by my junior high teacher who is also the author's brother. We all loved it, it sparked discussions and laughs, it pulls you in and you genuinely care about the characters, and are excited to see what happens next. Four years later while browsing the book store i saw it on the shelf and bought it immediately. On reading it the second time now more mature, i see even more of what makes this book so great. A story centred on a boy in a small town, daring to be different and trying to figure out where life is really going. many books try to tackle this and it all ends up sounding the same. Before the Flood breathes something different into that ""small town"" with lives and characters that will make you smile, make you sad, and get you thinking. Definately a book to pick up."
5,A Light is On. . .,"Have you ever looked around at American culture and wondered what went wrong. . .what is wrong? Paul Vitz gives us a goldmine of insight into the origin of modern angst. The 'selfism' described in this book will be recognizable, both in us and those around us. Truth seekers will find Vitz's exposure of the frauds of modern 'psychology' to be a milestone in their long search for answers to modern confusion. Then the real work begins. . . I recommend this book highly. You will not be disappointed."
3,The Boatlift,I didn't recognize some of the artists on the cd but I enjoyed the beat of the music- I thought it was a good breakout cd for Pit Bull considering it is from 2007. I am already a fan of his anyhow but I thought it was a fun cd to listen and dance too.
4,big improvement,"I deem The Boatlift to be a hughe improvement over El Mariel. I dont know why but i was never a big fan of that record. The Boatlift is en fuego. It contains many club jams such as Go Girl, Candyman, Levantante, and the anthem. One of my all time fav. joints off the record is Stripper Pole. You have to check out this cd."
5,gooder,"Good for being written in 1959, without access to all the archived data and new interviews and what not. This guy got it right. Sure there was stuff he could have added from new information available today, but this is great for what it is. I loved it."
3,Good bit for occasional use,"Pros:It's inexpensive, and performed well for the project I was was working on (mounting Sanwa 24mm arcade buttons).Cons:It's cheap construction matches the price. The cutting edges weren't honed all that well, and were surprisingly dull. It's good enough to cut through acrylic and pine, but I don't expect this bit to have a long lifespan."
5,"Recently republished, East Goes West deserves rediscovery.","One of the first works of fiction written by an Asian immigrant to the United States, Kang's novel describes his early adulthood with a poignant humor that touches not only on his most positive experiences in a new country--such as being befriended by other Korean Americans--but also on some of his worst: the time when college classmates convinced him to run a race in long underwear. Kang, however, never forces us to feel sorry for him; simply by relating his experiences to us in a uniquely crafted language that reflects both his extensive literary training and his own quirky sense of style, Kang manages to win our sympathy for an obviously gifted young man who faces discrimination and hardship during his first years away from home"
5,East goes West,"This is an excellent book for anyone who would like to know how Koreans in early 1900 had lived in America. It is a story of exiles living in the U. S. waiting to return to Korea someday knowing then that it was an impossible dream. In his book I met many people I had heard of or read about. Mr. Younghill Kang, who is a friend of my remote aunt, is indeed a true poet."
2,Dont Buy It,This has everything to do with the quality of the CD rather than anything else.Music is great but the quality of the CD itself is complete cr4p. There is bad hiss in the background when u listen to the music that gets old really fast. Hate that while u r listening to good music.
2,Short shipped,I received this CD with only 1 CD instead of 2.Tried to contact seller- but no reply yet.I was very disappointed to have missing the 1 CD that had the songs I wanted.
5,a treasure!,"This CD is a joy to all fans of Jelly-Roll Morton, Scriabin and Joplin. If you like that toe tapping stomps and sweet bluesey style music this is for you! Last night we listened to it during our special dinner party. Birnbaum is an absolute treasure."
5,Kick -Ass Ragtime Playing,"I love such bold kick-ass ragtime playing from old school piano wizard Mark Birnbaum. The Charleston, Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll Morton and other tunes from the flapper years. great classical music too."
4,Worth reading-- but suspend your disbelief,"Grogan is a born storyteller, sorta like your old uncle who tells you in detail how he killed scores of Germans at the Battle of the Bulge. ""But Uncle Bert-- you were 12 years old in 1944!"" ""Yeah, but I enlisted early..."" Grogan is like that-- he tells a great story, and it's up to you to figure out which parts are true, and how much he's exaggerated: 20%, 50%, or 193%. Why this is worth reading: if you wish to know about the sixties and the counterculture in NY and LA and SF, and if you want a (mostly unreliable but entertaining) eyewitness, this will inform and intrigue. Someday, this will be made into a film-- if they can make a movie of Chuck Barris' ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" they can film this hodgepodge of fiction and fact as well."
2,Polemic to the People!,"A number of people have told me how much they enjoyed this book when it first came out; none of them had re-read it recently to give me an idea how well they thought it had stood up to time.It almost begs for a sound-byte: Hero/Antihero in the Summer of Love, bearing sorrow having fun...or something. Emmet Grogan was not a man for sound-bytes however, and his tale goes on and on. I liked the parts where there are glimpses of the streets and the people, what was going on. Unfortunately he can't stop there but provide an overlay of how he sees the true meaning of it, a truth that, oddly enough, revolves around the ego of Emmet Grogan. The further into his story, the more alone he seems to be, the fewer people who hang out with him, listen to him, be a friend.This could have been an evocative picture of the people and sensibilities of the times, but it's overwhelmed by the Digger loggorhea that Grogan fell in love with and felt compelled to wrap his history in."
5,An American classic?,"Each time I read this book, I'm more amazed and amused by it. There is never a dull moment, and I still can't figure out when or whether it crosses the line from fantasy into reality. It has a voice as authentic and American as ""Huckleberry Finn"" and Woody Guthrie's autobiography, and it stands as tall as they do in American literature, no joke. One of my favorites of all time. It captures a place and time, and delivers an unforgettable character, as charming as he is unreliable. I hope it will be rediscovered and recognized someday."
5,Wow! A Must for Genesis Fans!,"For anyone who loves the early to mid 70s period of Genesis, this is a must have! The sound is more like the Wind and Wuthering or Trick of the Tail period, but the vocals are pure Peter Gabriel. I was playing this at work, and my colleague, who is a big Genesis fan, stopped dead in his tracks. He would have bet money it was Peter Gabriel singing...he thought it was some lost Genesis album. Usually with German singers you can detect a German accent, but not here. The guitar is very Steve Hackett-like, the early keyboards, the flute, everything is wonderful. I'm so glad this was re-released in 2001. I just wish they did another album. You won't be disappointed."
2,Un-original and dull,"For starters, any band with a name like that would not make it very far in non-German-speaking world. The music is good only on the strength of being a Genesis clone, albeit not a great one. They tend to get into repetitious melodies and progressions, and the arrangements are not very sharp either. Any comparison to Genesis are only superficial, as they lack the compositional depth and sophistication, and chops to pull it off. Sounds like some of the recent neo-prog bands, who imitate Genesis. Anyway, not a bad album, pleasant sounding, but not worth the trouble and expense to add to your prog collections, in my opinion."
5,A Great Tool,"The book was very helpful. It has words for all levels of learning Spanish. It is very detailed and easy to use. Best of all, it is small so you can take it anywhere."
3,"Solid bag, needs pockets","It's a good bag, has decent padding and appears pretty durable. Nice zippers, which is always important. The main drawback is lack of any pockets for your fins/wax so they have to go in separate luggage or be carried unless you're cool with having them loose inside with your boards."
4,Look out Aldous Huxley,"Saunders delivers stories tinged with semi-alarm. In the style of Kurt Vonnegut, he gives his readers an existential tickle, then leaves them with a sense of horror in retrospect. Each story has its own life and each its own voice. Saunders is very apt at taking the perspectives of myriad characters and his examinations are simultaneously overwhelmingly succint and comprehensive. Readers living 50 years from now may compare this collection to the perspicacious clairvoyancy of Jules Vernes."
3,"Fun, but overdone","Saunders is clever and creative, but heavy-handed in tossing down his themes. He is best when hitting closest to home; ""The Red Bow,"" for example, or ""Christmas"" -- two heartbreaking stories that rang much more true than the overdone zanyness of his other stories."
3,"Okay, but Four 80's done better","Not a bad album, but this group's developed since this was released. All due respect to ""Ed"", I'd put this group in the same genre as 3rd Force, but not in the same class.Several cuts are very redundant to the point that my wife asked me (on the first evening of listening to it) ""Is it possible for a CD to stick?""There is, however, a lot of good stuff on it. Still get a big kick out of ""Skip Tracer"".If you're a fan of Four 80 East, I'd recommend you add this to your collection. If you're not familiar, I'd suggest Nocturnal or Round 3 to start you out."
1,Not What I Expected,"Sorry, but I disagree with the rest of these reviews. I purchased Four 80 East after reading all these reviews, listened to the entire CD on several different occasions and just didn't like it. Not as good as the reviewers say. This group sounds like some guys who got together in someone's garage and thought they could cut a CD. The music has no heart and seems to just ramble. Trust me, if you know real jazz...Four 80 East (there only CD)should not be considered. Again, this is not a very good CD. I doubt if we ever hear from these guys again. Sorry, but I just couldn't get into their music."
5,This is a Jazz Masterpiece!!!,"This is great jazz!!! If you are into driving jazz bass, this is for you. A little bit of Joyce Cooling on some cuts and some good old fashioned funk others. Ten great cuts in all. A ""must get"" CD!"
4,Acid meets Smooth,"Very cool, acid-y jazz, although it doen't fall into the ""smooth"" (i.e more contemporary, which has become a bit sterile) jazz category because it has more kick with it's keyboard and sax punctuations.The opening track, 'Eastside', is the best piece, setting the tone with a clever mix of funk, acid and modern.Also, I was pleased with their new follow-up, Nocturnal: more fluid and subtle, and, although less daring the 'Eastside', a good follow-up."
5,"Smashin' Funky, Jazzy Cool Beautiful","Well, I must say I was very surprised when I heard this album. It is absolutely superb! I escpecially like the bass.. thumbs up!"
4,My daughter loves it !,"My daughter is 2 yrs. old, and got this doll for Christmas. It was her favorite of all her toys. She loves that she talks to you, and recognizes her as her mommy, and tells her when she's hungry, etc... I would have given the doll a complete 5 stars except, they could have made her hair stay up a little better, knowing that small children will be wooling her around. Her hair was only put up with clothe bows. When it started to fall down I just put it back up with some hair bands, and now it's fine. Other than that, shes a great little doll that my daughter just loves, and I think any little girl would. If you get it, you may also want to check out the Little Mommy Diaper back w/ accessories by Mattel. I got this to go with my daughters doll, and they go perfect together. My daughter loves them both!"
3,"Kind of annoying, but it is what it said it is...","My kids like this more than any of the other ""baby dolls"" in the house, but I think it may be more for the annoying factor than anything else. I don't think it really responds properly to the inputs, ie being fed the apple, or milk, etc. but it makes the kids laugh. It might be frustrating for kids who are really trying to ""mother"" the doll though. Mine seems to mostly want to speak Spanish only, even when in ""English"" mode."
5,Outstanding,"Mike has truly excelled himself with this brilliant album. The title track is one of the most uplifting and well written songs i have ever heard. Other stand out tracks include, Make Make, and Music From The Balcony. An exceptional piece of work. Well done Mike."
4,Killer CD,These guys kind of remind me of Dew Scented meets Soilwork. Really tight death metal feel mixed with some melodic keyboards. Definately above par release in an era dominated by the New England metal-core sound. Hopefully these guys will get some attention.
2,SERIES DETOUR TO VAMPIRE LAND,"Let me start by saying that so far I have loved the series. I was able to devour one book after the other in the series. I enjoyed the other books very much, I would have liked it if new characters were introduced but i looked past that. This book however, was like hitting a pothole in the middle of a highway. Don't get me wrong if you like vampires it's a very enjoyable, readable book. However, if you ask me it has nothing to do with the series. I personally would skip it and go to ""Legends"" which is the last book in the series and serves as a recap of entire series, sort of like what was happening in the background, when you were reading about the action in the foreground.I await more work by Robert Doherty"
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED UNDER THE AREA 51 NOVELS, WHICH WERE VERY GOOD. THE TEMPO AND PLOT WAS JUST TOO WEAK."
1,I hated this book,"I loved the Area 51 Series, but this book was just a disappointment. Looks like the author is now just milking what was a good series and taking advantage of readers who buy his books.Am definitely not buying the next book Area 51 - Legends."
3,Vampyre is introduced,Enhjoying the Area 51 series and this was no difference except I do not care a lot for vampire stories and this novel introduced sevewral of the undead and chronicled their history with the akiens. Just finished this and now on to The Legend!If you like vampires you will enjoy Nosferatu.
3,Nosferatu --,About average for this author. He has done his historical research quite well. Like weaving in operation paperclip and Alexander the Great.
1,Area 51: Nosferatu,"This manuscript involved too many iconoclastic ideas. Most people do not believe in ""vampires"" and the key to the invasion of the different humanoidraces lies in the the chambers that allow rejuvenation by imprint from a disk that is updated until a new clone must be used. (A possible idea).The off the wall idea is that some of the aliens have a factor in their blood that allows them to extend their life by infecting a non-alien, and utilizing that bloodperiodically to extend their lives.This makes the whole manuscript have a bad image after a few chapters.I think Mr.Mayer needed to publish or perish and this was the result. This was not the same class as his other books in this series. Thus I rated it one star."
4,Interesting perspective change,"This was a refreshing change in this series. I loved the different view point and characters built in this book.Furthermore, revisiting, different scenes throughout the series with a bit more details. Also, with some more explanation as to why they existed. Overall, I really enjoyed this book"
3,Area 51 Nosferatu,I wanted to read this book because the plot & characters did pull me in enough to make me want to find the outcome. I skipped many large chunks of the story because the author wandered off into long technical discourses which did nothing to further the plot & were of no interest to a non-science minded slug like myself.
4,Decent.,"Snagged these on a whim because of price. They haven't really done much. I am taking them with the Natural Sources - Raw Thyroid, 60 capsules every day with my Synthroid and beside a slight up in energy and mood, and a down in appetite, they haven't put me back on the normal train yet. I think it's just me though, so they get 4 stars."
2,"Dark urin, unsure","I have been taking 2 capsules a day for 5 days. My urine has been very dark and I have an unquenchable thirst. My liver and kidney's are weak, nothing seems to be processed very well, so this is probably why. My eyes have been bloodshot and I have had no energy for about a year now, so I've been desperate to find something to help me feel normal again. I had a cancerous brain tumor removed 2 years ago which has thrown my body out of wack. So, those first 4 days of taking Raw Adrenal, my bloodshot eyes cleared up for the first time and I felt pretty good. Today, my eyes are back to being bloodshot and I'm very tired. My thirst is extreme and my urine looks like I haven't drank any water in days. I would love to know if anyone else has had this urine issue with this supplement."
4,Worked Great But......,"I am hypothyroid ( 125mcg of Synthroid) age 50. I also take a good multi-vitamin, plus 2000IU of D3 and one Raw Thyroid every day.I added the Raw Adrenal, at first two pills per day and I felt nauseous.I lowered it to one Raw Adrenal per day and felt I had the right combination with my other pills. Unfortunatley, it raised my blood pressure about 20 points over a 6 month period so I had to stop taking the Raw Adrenal. I know the other pills weren't the cause of the spike because I have been on them for several years.The Raw Adrenal did help with bloating and I wish I had not had a problem with it. It may have been due to the ginseng in the adrenal supplement."
1,disappointed,"I've taken other adrenal products (Isocort, ADR Formula by Pure Encapsulations, From Fatigued to Fantastic Adrenal Stress End), and I noticed the LEAST difference while taking this one... basically no difference at all in my energy level. It's frustrating, from the reviews it seems to work for some people, but not for me."
1,Raw Adrenal,"After reading the reviews about this product, I thought I would give it a try. I have been using Isocort for quite some time, and I was hoping that this would work the same. This did nothing for me. It was a total waste of money. I'll stick to Isocort."
1,product contains maltodextrin,"Look out if you are glutamate sensitive, this contains maltodextrin and may give you a reaction. In my case it is migraine."
4,2 weeks and loving it!!,I started this 2 weeks ago after reading the reviews. I was diagnosed with Adrenal Fatigue almost 2 years ago and went thru many supplements (don't do prescription meds to many side effects)and this one is the best by far. I did notice the subtle difference until my daughter mentioned I had cleaned the house in under 2 hours including two bathrooms. I have since noticed that I don't need a afternoon nap and my anxiety has decrease dramacatily. Yes try this product! I am going to supplement Raw thyroid to see what is can do for me.
1,NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL/ PRODUCT GAVE ME HORRIBLE HEART PALPATATIONS!,"I order this product and shortly after I started taking it I began having horrible heart palpatations and anxiety. I felt like I was gonna die, I didn't know what was going on with me.. then I realized the only change I had made was adding this supplement to my routine, I stopped taking it two days ago and heart palpatations went away, anxiety is getting better. I had already ordered my second shipment but it hadn't shipped yet/nor did the payment go through, so I requested a cancelation. I wrote the company and told them I have been having heart problems with this supplement and to please cancel my order. They have not responded and within a few hours the status changed to SHIPPED. I wrote a second time and still no response."
4,product option,"I've just started trying this product to support my over-stressed adrenals. I have more energy, but haven't taken it long enough to truly assess its value."
1,If you are allergic to corn or ginseng don't buy!,"The ad for this product was deceptive. It makes it seem as if it is just adrenal tissue but they are full of all kinds of things, vitamins, White Korean ginseng, matodextrin from corn etc. If I had known this before hand I would not have purchased. It may work for others but it made me sick."
3,Not sure,Took as directed and didnt see/feel anything at all. These smell bad and are hard to swallow since they were sort of covered in a powder which made them stick when taking.
3,Gives me energy,"This product makes me feel better after suffereing from fatigue, joint pain, missed periods and mood swings but the only downsize is it causes me to have vaginal bleeding. After being on it a week I started bleeding like a period and have'nt stopped for 2 weeks so I'm afraid I'll have to go off of it! To bad because I felt better but I'm gonna get Anemic with all the blood loss. I also started having some eyelash, eyebrow and top of head hair loss. I guess there's side effects to everything we take now adays. If you want to feel better and dont mind the side effects then give this RAW ADRENAL'S a try."
1,"Be Careful, I got ""very sick"" after few days of taking it","OK, I have been taking Natural Sources Raw Thyroid for almost 6 weeks and felt pretty good.I ordered Raw-Adrenal after looking at the reviews here and after taking it for just 5 days (only 1 tablet) I got really sick with severe numbness in my hands and feet, painful hands and feet, foggy brain, dizziness, body aches, and just general sick feeling all around. I think the B6 vitamin in it can do this but i am not sure so I stopped taking it. Within one day of stopping it I am feeling 50% better and hope to return to normal within next few days. It was just awful feeling so sick.My wife tried it for 3 days and did not feel any difference.I still take raw thyroid and I am happy with it.Just be careful and stop taking it if you start to feel sick.Btw, I had the security seal missing/felloff when I opened the bottle.Update: Today is 3rd day after I stopped taking it and I feel almost normal again."
2,not so good,"Just putting them in my mouth made me gag. They smell of rotting meat and I struggle getting past that. Once I do, I see no difference and I've been taking them for a while."
4,Childhood pleasures,"These books(the whole World's End series) have been hovering in my head for years, despite the fact i have been able to find no trace of their existence for nearly a decade. They are not about the world's end, but rather a family that comes to live at the World's Inn, a delapidated old inn, referred to as ""World's End"" by the locals. With their parents out of the picture the four children must learn to survive on their own, and later with their changed parents. They must hide from the world their unsupervised status and figure out how to live normally, getting jobs and such. If you can find a copy these books are efinitely worth it."
3,tough call,"This album really isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, I love Autechre... But this release just doesn't do it for me. They've gone beyond reasonable listening. What direction could they possibly take now? They continue to surprise as every release get more and more left field. This release, like other AE releases, will grow on you with listens.. But there is just something off about this one."
2,Sonic Fractals,"""Draft 7.30"" proved Autechre could still lay down their high-frequency calculus while making it at least somewhat musical. This is just a regression back to cerebral noise. The reviewer who suggested people ignore this if they want ""old IDM"" is perfectly right. Call it what it is but don't call ""Untitled"" IDM. The old Autehre was musical. What the new Autechre has been doing for the past five years is more akin to slapping a high tension wire with a conceptual physics textbook. People who enjoy their recent material rarely speak of it in emotional or even sentimental terms. More power to them if that's not what they enjoy. For me, this music is a fractal, not an oil painting. It may look like art but it's really one long, complex mathematical process."
2,"Intriguing, but wholly unmelodic","Music is defined as:""The art of arranging sounds in time so as to produce a continuous, unified, and evocative composition, as through melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.""Therefore, this is NOT music.Every track on this album makes me think it was created by a paranoid hummingbrid who just dropped large amounts of LSD. The music is relentless and if you search for rhythm or harmony, you will be sorely disapointed. However, maybe that's why people enjoy this album. Because it is being listened to with the presumption it is ""music"" the mind is constantly working during listening to it to try and find ""music"" within. Which doesn't happen. This album is all about the quest to find; ignore that the outcome is nothing to be found."
5,Animal's Finest,"In my opinion, this is the finest of Animal's books. Animal has always written in order that the reader does not get his butt kicked. The first couple of chapters are nothing more than a condensed version of his other books. But the later chapters are what makes this book work.Animal does a great job in giving you tips in leaving a scene in a hurry, especially if you are running away from a gang. Some require prior actions, liking feeding neighborhood dogs, but most do not. He also discusses how you can counterattack your pursuers.Lastly, Animal talks about how to stay away from those seeking you out. First he tells you how to hide away from the police and organized crime. Then he tells you how to avoid the local yokals.All in all, a fine book."
2,It's common sense,"Testosterone aside it is nothing but common sense. If another human being is interested in mudering, raping, stabbing, or beating you up then it goes without saying that you should run away. Of course every man out there that is proud of his ability to ""fight"" people and will argue this point. In the real world running away is almost always want you want to do if you can. If you need a book to tell you how to run away from a murderer then you probably are not too bright in the first place. And therefore I doubt your ""book"" knowledge will save you from the murderer. It's entertaining to read to a certain point. Just depends on what kind of mentality you have and how scared of bullies you are. Those things will be what determines whether you should buy this book or not."
5,enchant-live at last,"I first heard this band from a sample c.d.The vocal's and guitar's caught me at first.Several c.d.'s later,they are a great band with great music.I just can't wait for the d.v.d.to be released again."
4,Live and Loud...,"I decided rather than buy all the studio releases, I'd buy this live set instead. All of their releases are represented here in the songset with in some cases, more than one track from a particular release. The playing is fine throughout. The sound quality however is the typical 'all-levels-maxed-out' which some may like but I feel it makes for a hard listening experience. The dynamics are fighting for space where this is limited room. I would classify the overall sound as 'LOUD'. The booklet has photos and lyrics for each track which is a nice touch. Disc 1/11 tracks/72.39. Disc 2/12 tracks/78.59."
4,Good CD,Good album to chill to. All the songs are good.1. Running Blind 9/102. Re-Align 7/103. Touche 8/104. Voices 8/105. Keep Away 7/106. Spiral 7/107. Asleep 6/10
3,This sounds familiar.,"Many people say it, and I'm going to say it too. I've been a huge Alice In Chains fan. It's seriously not even funny. It is a pale imitator.I have to say, I would have liked to have heard more new songs instead of the majority just their old songs done acoustically. Running Blind is done really well, but the other two new ones aren't really that great. Keep Away sounds pretty good, and Asleep came out excellent. The rest of the album is just not up to par. For me, Alice In Chain's ""Jar Of Flies"" is the standard to how hard rock / metal bands should do this type of thing."
5,On The Other Side,"This album is definately different that what they've done in the past. Acoustic versions of some old songs and some new ones, brings to mind something different. In terms of, how a hard rock band can use their talents into presenting songs that are of the opposite of the hard rock sound.My most favorite songs on the CD are ""Touche,"" ""Asleep,"" ""Keep Away,"" and ""Running Blind."" I like the way everything's just stripped down to acoustic guitar, vocals, and drums. it's nothing to hard."
1,AliceSmack,"First off I would like to say that some of Godsmack songs at one point in my life sounded ok, but being that the lead singer tries so hard at sounding like my favorite singer and in my opinion one of the most brilliant human being of all time, Layne Staley R.I.P. it makes me sick. Sully could never come close to Layne, no one will ever and thats a given fact. Isn't Godsmack the track on Alice in Chain's album Dirt? Oh I'm sorry it was God Smack. Even if the band started as a AIC cover band it really makes me sick that they try to pose or atleast Sully after two albums. This album to me is almost an insult and smack at the late Alice In Chains. Actually every album of this band to me is. I'm sorry,but being a die hard Alice In Chains fan it just annoys me when I hear this band. I wonder how many more lyrics of Laynes is Sully gonna try to swindle. If you want a real great albumthan try anything from Alice In Chains, Madseason, or any other great band that emerged from the Seattle scene."
1,Horrible,GODSMACK=All songs sound the same....nuff said what they need to do is stop touring and learn how to play the damn guitar
5,"Pure, Raw Greatness",Sully's voice is so pure and the acoustic guitars on this album make this CD a must for any fan of great rock music. Every song still has the dynamic powerfulness of Godsmack but in a lighter fashion. Their raw energy is where the powerfulness comes from on this CD.
4,Great CD,"You don't have to be a fan of Godsmack, or metal for that matter, to enjoy this CD. It's content can and should be appreciated by all rock fans alike. Yeah there's only 7 songs on it, but all of which are great quality. Not like they are charging full price like everyone else. Personal favorites are Voices and Running Blind. I'm not one to listen to a CD over and over, but The Other Side changed that for me."
3,Not too bad...could be better,I am a fan of Godsmack even though they are parallels of AIC. I am not knocking this album because of its similarity to SAP and Jar of Flies ( Almost every band is a derivative of another ) I was hoping for an album that contained all originals not acoustic songs that they have already done. If you are a Godsmack fan you will definitely like this album. If you hate Godsmack for the obvious reasons and buy this cd and give it 1 stars then you need help.
4,Excellent cd!,"The Other Side is a great break from Godsmack's usual heavy songs. I'm glad to see more acoustic albums nowadays. My favorite tracks are Asleep (which is an awesome, slower version of Awake), Voices, and Touchi. Smooth, refined and entrancing. I highly recommend fans of Godsmack and rock in general buy this album. It's well worth your money."
3,Good Cd,Not the best thing Godsmack has put out its a little different but ive learned to love it a little its a good listen every once in a while.
4,Jar of Flies (revisited),"Took me back in time, errhhh.... 10 years?!?! Sounds just like Alice in Chains (unplugged + choirs + melodies) and felt really good to listen to this album. Not a must have for music lovers but indeed a must have for Godsmack fans. If you enjoyed ""Dirt"" and ""Jar of Flies"" don't hesitate, buy this one!!!"
1,0 Stars If I Could,"All I can say is this is just a disgrace to all Godsmack fans around the world. How can they give us this slow acoustic crap when were use to their heavy guitar riffed songs? This album just isn't them at all. Godsmack will always be known for their heavy crazy headbanging rock/metal. If your a true Godsmack fan, you WON'T buy this! End of Story!"
1,rip off,In sted of riping of bit of the Black Album and riping Facelift and Dirt. They try to take step up in ripping off Alice In Chains and rip off their MTV unpluged only they suck a^s at playing. how about this for next Godsmack album cover.Sully Erna eating Laynne Staley's corpes waering a Kron shirt while cash blows out his a^s
2,(2.5 Stars) Better Than I Would've Ever Expected...,"...though still not anything great. Godsmack have founded their career upon ripping off Alice In Chains and The Black Album. In fact sometimes I wonder if their goal in life is to become a Alice In Chains-Metallica cover band. If so, they've come one step closer because they just half way successfully ripped off Jar Of Flies. I know what you're thinking, those mother f*ckers who can't even play a power chord right made a decent acoustic album?! Yes, even I, a proud hater of Godsmack and nu-metal in general have to admit that. Do I recommend running out and buying it? No, I'm just giving a heads up that you may not want to turn the dial the next time a Godsmack song comes on the radio."
1,A Study in Confirmation Bias. Returned.,"The wishful thinking in this book gives Erich von Däniken a run for his money; every rock, map, painting and manuscript can somehow be interpreted to support the author's theory. The book was returned to the retail outlet where it was purchased."
5,COMPELLING EVIDENCE IF YOU KNOW THE CLUES TO LOOK FOR!!,"It is interesting to see how the people with the mindsets that find this re-surfacing info upsetting to their ""theories"" or beliefs of how spiritual power gets handed down almost always tell you how awful these books are that you wouldn't even want to ""waste your time""!! I'd say, take that as a clue that there might be some important info within!! I've been following this intrigueing scenario for most of my lifetime here and now, and this is important info coming out~~!! Look at the bodymindspiritjourneys.com website if you're interested in tours to some of these ""Sinclair sites"" and other Templar history sites."
5,HANDY GIZMO,"First you have a phone, then you want a gps, but you want them both to work. But you only have one lighter outlet. Now I can can flap my jaw and find my way to the mall all at the same time."
2,Not what I expected,"When I bought these boots I was very excited to receive them and wear them out...BUT I was so disappointed. The picture is better than the real thing. The pirate cuff is way more pronounced than you would think and they fall too short on the leg to pull it off. They look cheap and costumey. I think the worst thing is that the boot is very heavy and clunky. I don't need a weird-looking, clunky boot taking over my whole outfit. Yuck."
3,Boots,"Nice boots, but couldn't wear them because the calf size was too small. It would help if the calf size was listed as well as the boot size."
5,Amazing,"If you are going to buy one melvins album make it this one. It is truly their best. It starts off with about ten minutes of very earth inspired droneing feedback. I realize that this may initially sound like kind of a turn off but its really not at all, its almost soothing. Then it bursts into what is probably the most epic of all melvins tracks. ever. Next is a cover of the flipper track sacrifice, which sound incredible sung by buzz.The only let down from this album is the fairly mediocre With Teeth. This is the only melvins song that I would really concider grunge. But fortunatly it ends before it gets annoying.p.s. Beware of any melvins album after this if you dont like generic hard rock"
3,strange cover choice for this one.,"this cd's cover painting was originally going to be used by the beach boys on their aborted 'landlocked' album. Which I have a boot of and it's great really. This is not this bands best at all , it's the least melodic of their efforts to a degree. So it's for completists only. I do like earlier stuff from this band much more though."
1,Look elsewhere,"This book is a general discussion of life's hardships in a heavily scriptual context. It has very little to do with the problems encountered by singles in day to day life. The author apparently considers herself an expert on being single due to a recent break-up with a fiance in her mid twenties. Unfortunately, her experience is not particularly relevant to people who have been single for many years or are single in their 30's or 40's, which is significantly different from being a single 20-something."
5,Great don't miss it especially Sean Bean fans,"Sean Bean is cast in his best part in my opinion, as well as Daragh O'Mally and all of the ""Chosen Men"" I wish there were more, the last two are Sharpe's Peril and Sharpe's Challenge. All the gals out there should love this series if you like War mixed with some love the trust of his men and all of the characters."
2,Entertaining but not educational,"I purchased this set hoping that there would be some educational information conveyed in each episode about the places the show visits. I was sorely disappointed. The sites are phenomenal, but the shows are mostly about someone trying to pull off a dangerous stunt. The stunts aren't to learn anything new about the sites, or to do research. Very little history or science is conveyed.I personally think that each episode could be better done in about 10 minutes. There is way too much duplicated footage and the drama shots are overdone. However, if you like other shows about stuntwork, you may like this one. At least the main character is concerned with safety and some conservation."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Not at all what I was expecting. I thought I was purchasing a ""How to"" video and while I did get one or two ideas, I did not find it instructional."
3,STEREO!!! STEREO!!! STEREO!!!,"This is a great compilation of those old original London singles and their B-sides, but the the love of Jagger, why can't these songs be released in STEREO!!!!???? The same thing happened on the first four Beatle CD's. I grew up in the sixties...I heard the originals on the LP's. THEY'RE OUT THERE!!! Let us have them!...thank you and good night."
1,"a/k/a The ""Do Not Buy"" Singles Collection","My problem? These songs are missing: GIMME SHELTER, LET IT BLEED, MIDNIGHT RAMBLER, UNDER MY THUMB ... and this song deletes the orchestral intro, and it also starts with a bad half-note guitar intro due to that deletion: YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT ... You can say that again."
3,All glitter and tarnished gold,"THE ROLLING STONES SINGLES COLLECTION * THE LONDON YEARS consists of three CDs packed in the LP-sized box that was in vogue 10 or 15 years ago-- in hindsight, a wastefully expensive package. The included 72-page giant book is of recycled-quality paper. It's pages are dyed several starkly annoying colors, and all graphics are in low-grade B&W.; Two pages of text in front, and two in back bookend the spread out song lyrics and lousy-looking photos. A hack job, design-wise.The music is little better, sonically. There's a persistent dullness to a lot of these tracks. Andrew Oldham is credited with oversight of this project, so it's surprising that the transfers aren't more vibrant. This great material has been badly served. Recommended only for serious fans or completists. A middling rating for a mediocre product.TOTAL RUNNING TIMES --DISC ONE -- 66:41DISC TWO -- 68:27DISC THREE -- 49:39"
5,I think this is a great boxset.,I think if you like the stones you should get this 3cd boxset.I think it sums up their best work from the 60's and the early 70's so if you are thinking of geting the stones music get this boxset.
3,More hits than misses!,"I think the Stones are the best rock band of all time, but I don't really understand the enthusiasm for this collection. B-sides in the sixties were generally throwaway tracks that didn't merit inclusion on an album, and I think that's true of most of the ones included here. ""Child Of The Moon"" is a notable exception. Decca in the U.K. issued a double album called ""Rolled Gold"", which has sadly since been deleted, but it contained all the singles they released in the sixties and none of the 'fillers'. In conclusion, Stones obsessives will listen to every track, but most people will skip most of the B-sides."
5,mini key chain,i love this key chain. it has a removable drum stick that doesn't exactly play but it does make some noise. the stick has a rope that connects so it won't get lost and it snaps to the front so it won't dangle.
4,Suspensful Teen Drama,"Lifetime movies are hit-or-miss affairs, typically high on drama but lacking in the plot/acting department. This movie is an exception to that. The story involves a group of four teenage girls, one of which is the outsider in the group. The three other girls decide that they should play a prank on her, which predictably goes terribly wrong, as teenage pranks typically do.This prank, however, results in murder, and of course the three girls try to pin it on the other one. This sounds like a story that has been re-used over and over again. and it is, but the movie is fun and entertaining to watch. Cynthia Gibb gives a strong performance as a mother in a tight spot trying to prove that her daughter is not a murderer.This DVD will not play on standard US DVD players, as it is region 2. However, the movie typically runs on LMN and Lifetime frequently. Recommended if you are a fan of movies like ""Sorority Row"" and ""The Woods."""
3,Am I in the Twilight Zone??,"I gave this movie 3 stars which I think was exceedingly generous. I am unable to comprehend how so many people think this mediocre movie AT BEST could ever warrant 4 stars. It was not all that well written, overall poorly acted and unconvincing and it wasn't even based on a true story from the investigation I have done on it.I used to be a big fan of Lifetime and it's movies but there are rarely any well made, good quality movies made by Lifetime, Hollywood or by anyone for that matter anymore.I yearn for more movies like Gracie's Choice, Lies My Mother Told Me and Homeless to Harvard. THOSE were enthralling, well written, very well acted and in a league far from this movie.I guess if you are looking for something to pass the time this movie is ok..... otherwise get real with the ratings people!!"
1,Steve,"I bought this laptop last week and returned it in less than one week. It had issues from the beginning, including needing to use a paperclip to open the cd tray after installing software. In addition, the system ran slower after each software installation, even though none were running in the background.Also, the disc, battery and blue tooth lights are located at the bottom of the keyboard, right where your left hand is placed. You catch the separators whenever you move your hand.After having all of the trouble, the vendor tried to assess a restocking fee of 15%, which of course I refused to pay."
5,fabulous account of a blues master just before he died.,Wonderful performance and nicely filmed. The fact that he died within 6 months of this show made it even better. I am looking forward to more of Luther's work on video and many other blues artists. FINALLY'
4,"Complicated recipes, but a fun book","""The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook"" is a great book to read, with interesting notes about the great pizzas served at the California Pizza Kitchen restaurants along with interesting recipes of the pizzas. The recipes appear complicated, with a long list of ingredients one might not have stocked in their home, but it is somewhat of an adventure to test out the recipes."
3,I was a bit dissappointed,I was a bit dissapppointed. I purchased this cook book thinking it was a cook book that featured all of the food found in California Pizza Kitchen Restaurants. Well needless to say my favorite Salad is not featured in this book. I always enjoy a Field Green Salad with Gorgonzola cheese this salad is not listed in the book...Putting together the salad is a breeze...I just wish I knew the ingredients to the dressing that makes it all worth while!If you are only interested in the actual Pizza & Pasta recipes then this is still a great buy!!!
3,Pizza cookbook,"The pizzas look good, but each one requires putting the pizza stone in the oven for 1 hour on 500 degrees. At the cost of present electricity and fuel, I don't think I will try it."
2,"Gorgeous photos, but not enough text","This is a high-quality book with gorgeous photos ... but not much else. The chosen parks are obscure (the only mention of Disney is Walt Disney World's Dixie Landings Resort) with very little text. It could've greatly benefited from some background information, design philosophy, even exact locations. This book would be a great addition to a coffee table, but the serious theme-park enthusiast will probably be disappointed."
4,Terrific,"This is great too!! But I wish it was longer, had more matches or even if there was a Part II or something. Maybe some day..............."
3,Somewhat Dissappointing,"This DVD was fair but nothing special. I was hoping for some classic matches and it seemed mostly made of odds and ends. also, the whole family wasn't in it - mostly just Kevin and Kerry. Also, the matches did not have the original commentary. That is what I look for in classic matches and to have no commentary or after commentary from Kevin (who doesn't speak to clear) is not worth it."
3,Pretty good...,"I wasn't a big Von Erich fan back in the day. I bought this dvd to see the Freebirds, Chris Adams and Gino Hernandez. The matches brought back a lot of good memories! The only thing that really bothered me about this dvd was the kayfabe commentary from Von Erich and referee David Manning. I didn't expect to hear about drug overdoses and suicides. But when Kevin says things like, ""I really thought we were going to have a good clean wrestling match..."" it's an insult to the viewers intelligence.I don't regret my purchase."
2,I couldn't even finish it!,"One of the things I looked forward to as a kid was waking up on Sunday morning and running to the tv to watch WCCW. That enthusiasm came flooding back as I took this DVD out of the package. I was so disappointed by what was to follow. Being the first DVD to document the Von Erichs and WCCW I expected better matches, production values at least that of a high school AV club, and at least some insight into the once glorious promotion. The matches follow no ascertainable progression, there are no bonus features, and the suff taped on the ranch is just corny. In the end Kevin Von Erich comes off looking like he took a few hundred too many chair shots to the head. PASS ON THIS ONE AND WAIT FOR THE WWE PRODUCED DVD'S TO COME OUT NOW THAT THEY HAVE BOUGHT THE TAPE LIBRARY!"
3,A fairly useful collection of words and phrases,"I bought this book at Fred Hanna's Bookshop in Dublin, where it was displayed in a cellophane wrapper, so I had no idea of the contents. It's less of a dictionary than a collection of usages from throughout Ireland-however, it is thoroughly enjoyable from a lay point of view; more so than from a scholarly point of view. It also contains an excellent bibliography."
2,The Great Grimoire of Pope Honorius III,"This is a poorly translated text. Probably by a teacher with little knowledge of real ritual practices. Meaning, it would be dangerous to use. There are far better versions of this texttranslated by true occultists. Lots of bad information."
5,Great.,"Excellent recordings, music well produced. Lovely songs and all of them are great to inspire lots of dancing and fun."
2,Craftsman quality but broken from company,I did not return because I don't have time to deal with it. Purchased for my husband and bottom door under drawers was completely off! My husband fixed it and he is fine with it... I was upset. I emailed company after we received and got NO RESPONSE!
4,Commercial Perfume Bottles,"This is the book to indulge in envy! Most of the collection pictured and written about is unavailable to the average collector, however it is a visual feast and the text about the perfumiers is informative. I do not regret having purchased this book and look upon the contents as my ""wish list"" or holy grail of perfume bottle collecting."
4,Great pendant...Chain not so good,"This is a fantastic little pendant, but the chain is worthless. I had to get another chain for it. I do with it was a little bit larger, but it will do. Looks fantastic on. I would recommend it specially for a teenager or younger person b/c of its size."
5,VERY SWEET,"THE NECKLACE WAS VERY SWEET, BUT THE CHAIN WAS SHORT. I ORDERED IT FOR A GIFT FOR A YOUNG GIRL, AND I THINK IT WILL BE PERFECT FOR THAT. I WAS VERY HAPPY OVER ALL. IT IS NOT THE SELLER'S FAULT THAT I HAVE TOO MANY CHINS. HA HA I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO OTHERS. THE NECKLACE WAS VERY SWEET AND I WAS HAPPY WITH IT. THANKS."
4,My wife loves it!,The pendant is nice my wife is very happy with it. We got the order quick. The only thing that was missing was the gift note other wise I would of gave 5 stars.
5,Same Story,"To reiterate what others have said, the pendant is beautiful and looks to be high quality. Note the listed size in the description so as not to be surprised by how small it is. It's understated but intricate and goes well with many things without being dominating. As others have noted, the chain is quite thin, but it seems sturdy and nice enough that I don't plan to replace it. Perhaps slightly expensive for what it is, but still a great buy."
1,Not The Same As Pictured,"After years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first time I've ever been so disappointed that I've had to return something.I bought this for my oldest daughter a year ago- it was just as pictured, came with a good chain and a nice velvet pouch. She just loves it and wears it every day. I ordered this for my younger daughter and it came today...it is NOT the same necklace. It's not even the same one pictured. The sides of the pendant are not filigree- it's solid and not very pretty. The chain isn't the same as pictured in the item description, either. Also, it did not come with the velvet pouch.I'm very upset that the descriptions (pendant, chain, pouch) are completely wrong. The quality also seems to be quite low compared to the first one I bought.I was looking forward to giving my youngest daughter this necklace for Valentine's Day. She wanted one just like her big sister, and I was hoping that it would be something she could keep forever."
4,very nice,I found the piece to be small but she loved it. That is all that matter's. I would recommend this item.
5,Sift through the mess of liberalism,"As the majority of state colleges move more and more to the left, indoctrinating students with their own brand of beliefs, its important, as a conservative, for me to attend a school that is private and morally sound. This book is the perfect guide for finding out which colleges are conservatively sound. That doesn't mean that these centers of higher ed. are going to shove conservatism into your heads, but rather, you can rest knowing that they won't inappropriately preach extreme political beliefs.It's very well organized and researched. ISI really knows its stuff!"
5,Hilarious and revealing resource,The Game of Truth is a wonderful resource for team and individual development. It is very useful to break the ice when bringing people of many different backgrounds together. The book builds self-esteem and enhances communication in a fun and even therapeutic way. It is a great idea generator and relationship builder. The illustrations are excellent and add to the intrigue.
4,"synth, but not electronica: still a good cd","Amazon has this listed as electronica, which i disagree with. There is quite a bit of synth in this album (but different from usual electronica synth), but the soul of the music is in the piano. Tracks on this CD that stick out to me are Grandfather's Dance, which is very mellow, and Main on the Shore, which sounds like a irish or maybe scottish folk tune. Personally, I like the ""Cathedral"" album much more. It has a more jazzy feel to it than this cd."
5,Joe Has Landed...,"It's possible that Joe Preston was sent here from the far reaches of space by a higher life-form in order to conduct mind control experiments upon the unwitting human race. Master of sonic deconstruction he gives new meaning to the word heavy. Three planet swallowing songs await you on this CD. Screw H.A.A.R.P., we should worry about what Mr. Preston is doing to our brains."
2,DISAPPOINTING...,"The guy describing this book as a tutorial is dead on...Perhaps this merging of art and technology stuff was revolutionary several years ago, but in 2002 I feel that this book has been quickly out dated. It is way too basic and lengthy, more like a book you glance through than one that you read. For a straight 'artist' with no mathematical abilities, maybe it will be helpful but for a design professional with a brain, it seems almost insulting.Check it out of the library if you are curious, but save your money..."
3,Kodak 120 Color Film,Film produced great photo's when placed in my medium format camera. Couldn't have been more pleased. Too bad its not availabe on Amazon anymore.
2,Sorry Jackie!,"I own this movie but can honestly say I've only watched it once!I can't put much rating on a movie which put me to sleep.Jackie evidently had a little time on his hands to make thismovie. And I do repeat a ""little"" time on his hands. Not muchaction, too much plot. Yawn, Yawn!! Budget film at its worst!"
4,THIS IS THE TYPE OF JACKIE CHAN MOVIE I LOVE AND MISS,"REMEMBER WHEN JACKIE CHAN KICKED ASS? REMEMBER WHEN JACKIE CHAN WAS THE COOLEST MARTIAL ARTS STAR ALIVE? WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WAS BEFORE HE GOT OLDER AND BEFORE HE STARTED POPPING UP IN HORRIBLE MOVIES LIKE ''AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS'' AND ''SHANGHAI NOON''. IN THIS CLASSIC MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE FROM THE 1970S, JACKIE CHAN PLAYS A YOUNG MAN WHO'S CONSTANTLY HAUNTED BY THE FACT THAT HE WITNESSED HIS FATHER'S MURDER. AFTER LEARNING SEVERAL STYLES OF MARTIAL ARTS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE [INCLUDING A PRISONER WHOM HE BRINGS FOOD TO EVERYDAY IN EXCHANGE FOR KUNG FU LESSONS], HE SOON SETS OUT TO FIGHT THE WOODEN MEN AND AVENGE HIS FATHER'S MURDER. A VERY GOOD MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE THAT HAS MEMORABLE FIGHTS, WHICH'RE ALWAYS FUN TO LOOK AT. THE MOVIE'S WORTH IT ALONE FOR THE CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN JACKIE CHAN AND THE WOODEN MEN."
4,a difficult book to read,"i loved and hated this book. loved it because javan was such a wonderful character. hated it because, well ... take the title literally."
5,The eternal battle between good and evil.,"I am in a love/hate relationship with this book. The book was so well written you quickly become attached to the characters and fall in love with them. You find a continuation of events from previous novels accompanied by new developments. This of course leaves you wanting more. It is for all of these reasons that I loved the book.I hate this book for only one reason, and it directly correspondes with my fast growing love for the characters and how and when King Javan's Year comes to an end. A must read, but be prepared for tears."
5,The best of the best,"Katherine Kurtz takes her writing to a new level in this novel. Book two of the heirs of Saint Camber series, she gives the readers the feeling of hope for the characters. She definately takes a sad story and makes it beautiful by showing the true meaning of friendship, loyalty, and love. Again, this is a must read for anyone who is a fantasy fan, or even just someone who loves a friend."
5,works great with...,"These strips work great with just about any soft wax, I use a store bought saly hansen wax and the strips work like a charm. The kit I usually buy only comes with 20 strips and I end up running out of strips before I can actually finish the wax. These strips work perfectly as a supplement to the strips that come in my store bought kit. My only advice is that u have someone help u take it off for the best wax results. On the legs u will be fine doing it alone, but the underarms are alittle more difficult when using these strips..u might see alittle residue, but that's because these are cloth strips."
2,The wax soaks through the strips,I used the strips together with GIGI tea tree oil wax. The hot wax kept soaking through those strips making my hands sticky with wax. I know that the strips professionals use at salons don't soak through and they don't have to wear gloves. I wonder if there are other strips that don't soak.
5,Great,"this is my go to strips for at home waxing, i've always used it but i am happier now that i found amazon has it for a lower price than my basic beauty store.it does the job."
3,useful but a bit messy,"the only thing I didn't like about these strips is that their ""remains"" keep on falling off, creating a little mess whenever using them.But if you have wooden floor or a strong vacuum, this shouldn't be a issue."
5,no complaints; good product,"I purchased these to supplement the teeny packs of strips provided with drugstore wax-at-home kits. They have been great; no complaints. Because of the natural muslin fabric, they are easy to tear or cut to size. I'll probably buy more of these in the future; very good quality."
2,NEVER AGAIN,"These are the worst!! The wax soaks through, and I have to double them up just to use them. Byer Beware"
4,A valuable film about curanderismo,"This film is a slice of life picture of an average Bolivian curandero. As the other review mentions, it may not be stunning cinematography, or full of scenes of fascinating rituals. But as a student of the shamanic cultures of this region, I found it had a lot to offer. Among the things I found interesting was the herb identifications, the demonstration of the use of guinea pigs in diagnosis, and the scenes of festival celebrations. While this movie isn't going to knock your socks off, it deserves 4 stars and I hope more film makers will be inspired to produce documentaries like this one."
2,disappointing!,"(if i was to give it another rating it would be 1 star)...bad photoquality, bad quality all the way. if you have serious interest i shamanism steer clear! it could have been cut down to about 15-20 minutes of useful information, but the quality of the pictures is totally crap - amateurish! the shaman in this documentary is fine enough, but doesn`t give the impression of being of the most advanced (not the one you travel half the world to see in person). sympathic and straightforward, honest..but more a traditional curer/curandero. this movie gives nothing to the ones interested in the study of consciousness. very disappointing! made of and for people with little knowledge and interest i shamanism."
4,Great new series,"Never read Bennett's stuff, but i like her style, it's really down to earth and talks in our (teen) language. Funny and entertaining. And i love the hospital theme, accurate info as well as great characters....Can't wait to read mission critical."
1,not worth the time,"I am usually interested in medical drama, but I almost gave up on this book after the first few pages. The language was choppy and stilted. It was supposed to appeal to teenagers, but I am a teenager, and it just sounded fake. I don't think anyone actually talks like that unless they are in Beverly Hills or on TV. It was a soap opera in book form. Just the names of the characters would tell you that -- Zoey, Tristan, Summer... The plot was choppy and I didn't feel like the characters were developed enough to feel any connection with them. There also wasn't very much actual medical drama...the book focused more on the interaction between the SCRUBS and the mean doctors. Finally, the ending was pure gimmick, and while it was a cliff-hanger, it didn't make me want to read the next book."
2,"Worked for two months, then the phone end fell off","What more can I say? You get what u pay for. Also, when it was still working it had trouble maintaining contact. Do not buy for long term or critical applications."
3,Cpen - Freestyle Mechanic,"Cpen's debut album, Freestyle Mechanic, dives into the heady waters of jazzy R&B, and Cpen manages to come up with some pearls. The grooves are laidback, the instruments harmonious, and the vibes easygoing. ""Silver Surfer"" glides along on waves of relaxation, while ""Late Night (Outta Sight)"" gives us a bass-driven journey through a starlit landscape. The funk comes alive on ""Dr. Sparkle's Theme""; ""Hydroglide"" gives us some light breaks. ""Flathead"" and ""End of the Line"" go for a slightly darker mood, though it's still very mellow. A very chill album, perfect for midnight drives on a summer's evening."
5,Fix your business,"Interesting look back at business management, with some new ideas...today!In 3 parts: Development, Methods, Effects. Includes chapters on the economy, the transition from free enterprise, the corporate pattern, trade position, problem of costs, pattern of prices, allocation of income, monopoly reconsidered. Hardback with manly tan covers and black lettering on spine."
5,Palvoline,"I have all their cd's and I am never dissapointed. I would rate them all 5*****. Everyone has there own sound & style, thats what makes them so great. I would not want some thing that always sounds like the last one. I am looking foward to hear what they got next! Palvolive has a great classic sound that never goes away."
5,Heads and Tales,"Unarguably the greatest, female, American sculptor of the 20thC., any artist who hasn't heard of or seen Malvina Hoffman's works must. She took an assignment to create 100 life-size bronzes for the Field Museum's (Chicago) Hall of Man and created them ON SITE at the end of the Roaring 20s. Even those who don't understand the laborious process can appreciate the side tales she relates of world events during this era. An excellent read."
5,Mudluscious!,This is a wonderful book. The text is simple and poetic. The illustrations are incredible. They make youw ant to go and play in the mud! This is perfect book for two through five year olds. I can't wait to us eit in my pr0k class room.
5,"Spaceships, aliens, pyramids and a good ending","Hi I don't write reviews and I love science fiction, so I have to make an exception and rave about this book. Resurrection tells a compelling story about how the pyramids were created, how interplanetary warring cultures get together and how people from different worlds fall in love. There is lot of everything in this novel; I couldn't put it down and I'm a really busy person. It's a first effort for this author and I hope she writes many more.Jim in Lodi"
1,Couldn't finish,"I've had this on my Kindle for months, but just started to read it. I couldn't; gave up less than half way through.Maybe it is me (of course it is), but I find the novels that bound about through time extremely annoying. Chapter 1 says ""Four Years Ago,"" Chapter 2 is ""Eighteen Years Ago,"" Chapter 4 is ""One Year Ago,"" and Chapter 5 is ""2607 BC."" Chapter 6 is back to ""One Year Ago,"" and then Chapter 7 is ""Present Day."" But exactly when is present day?There are several separate stories from different time lines, and by the time I gave up at Chapter 15 (""2605 BC""), there were only two specific characters that had been fleshed out in any way, and only one of them seemed to have many redeeming qualities.I am surprised at the number of positive reviews. I love good science fiction, but this didn't qualify for me."
3,Better in the beginning,"This book started off very promising....until the story made it to earth. After that it started to read less like a good sci-fi book and more like a generic moderately amusing action book. Unbelievable love relationships, and difficult to read action sequences due to constantly changing first person perspectives. Good solid ideas that needed a little more help with execution. Solid, but not great."
3,Entertaining,"Quite fetching, coherent story. The language is decent enough. Of course no classic. But all in all: I liked it."
4,I found this book and enjoyable read.,I found this book and enjoyable read. I would recommend book this to anyone who enjoys science fiction. Once I got into the book it was something that I did not want to put down.
4,Resurrection,I liked the characters and thought the story line was very interesting. It caught my attention so that I wanted to see what happened to them next.
3,Good idea but lacking in substance,"Overall good idea but plot was a bit weak. To expect 2 aliens to travel across several light years, bear a striking resemblance to humans and integrate into human society within days of arriving is a bit far fetched! Would have been a better story if more had been done with providing more depth to the protagonists, history of the 2 races, the war etc. Not sure about the Egyptian gods analogy - some of the original team members were last seen heading across the ocean - and what happened to them? Continuity of story was lacking."
5,Good look at a possible life,Well written with believable characters and a wonderful look at a possible past where I wonder how could we have built such wonders?
4,"Well written, believable for the most part.","I enjoyed this book. There were parts of it where there could have been more exposition, but that could have made the book too long. Parts of the book could have been left out, though, and it wouldn't have changed the readability.I've read better, and I've read much worse. I would like to see more from this author."
5,Great Book,"This is a very good book; wish there was a 2nd book to read! My mother loved this book, too!"
3,Pleasant entertainment for a day,"I really loved the technology developed by the two warring races. The biotechnology developed by the Kinley was particularly cool. However, while entertaining, the story a bit flat in spots, especially the action on Earth, often because descriptions were skimpy. The Mechanic was too able in his grasp of Earth politics and the politicians he was making deals with were amazingly guileless. The story was a tad too comic book for me. Lastly, the whole business with the first exploration crew resorting to changing their names to their job titles annoyed the hell out of me. That was too pretentious and precious, even for a group of scientist technicians."
5,great book,"I really enjoyed this book, like many other people i was surprised it was so good!Definitely recommend reading it."
2,Cheesy Science Fiction.,"All the classic, cheesy, Science Fiction cliches. Nothing new or inventive or even really interesting. Save yourself 350 pages of ""oh, my god, seriously??""Character development is almost Nil, story line reads like you've seen parts of it somewhere else, and the worst part is the gads of strange alien technology which miraculously appears whenever it's needed, then is never seen nor heard of again.A silly and trifling read.~EMB"
4,Resurrection,"I agree with the other reviewers, for what it was, I was pleasantly surprised. I got it on a daily deal, which are great opportunities to try out books I would not ordinarily read. Sure it doesn't have all the sophistication of some other novels, but the premise is plausible enough and the author weaves an interesting yarn. All in all, I rate my purchase as 4/5."
2,amateurish,"Has a decent plot to build on, but has several areas for improvement. Characters are weakly developed, and writing style needs work. It felt like I was reading juvenile fiction."
2,Shallow and simpistic,"I'm somewhat puzzled by the number of rave reviews. While the basic plot is adequate, if predictable and cliched, the writing is fairly weak, the characters shallow and poorly developed and the overall feel of the book is that of a quickly-drafted pander for young readers not quite ready for adult fiction. Please, folks, don't take this barely adequate entry as an example of good science fiction! I'd say it's worth the 99 cents on the Daily Deal, but certainly no more."
3,Bearable,"Honestly, for one who has taught the masters, Isaac Asimov, Aldus Huxley, George Orwell, et al. , this effort was somewhat a disappointment. Although always difficult to compare, Orson Scott Card's ENDER'S GAME, and even Douglas Edwards' WIRED, provided a more satisfying story although both were very different.Probably the handling of the time with 54 chapters ""ping ponging"" between eras was distracting and confusing. Given the subject matter, smoother transitions were possible.Three stars for the Echless Funnel concept, the race to resurrect it between the Luciens and Kinleys , and the concept of a relationship between a pure alien and a hybrid individual.This review surely points to the variety of tastes in the ever expanding science fiction genre."
1,Got to give this 1 star,"This book is terrible, meditating aliens that want wipe out another alien civilization, give me a break, I thought meditation was meant to lead to enlightenment, I can't keep reading it. I had to give this 1 star to bring it back down to earth, I always wonder if lots of good ratings on a book means the writer has lots of friends willing to lie for them."
2,Romance novel posing as scaince fiction,I bought this with the idea of reading a great scifi adventure. I deleted it after reading five pages. It read like a romance novel with the heavy hand of a female author leading to estrogen poisoning....
2,To simple.,"It was a nice subject, but the way it was written was a bit boring. There was much more to make of this theme.Call it a snack, nothing more. I don't no way people give it 5 stars. It's certainly not the best sci-fi there is."
1,Unfinishable,"I'm...unable...to....finish...this...book...because...the...narrator....is...the....worst.... It's....like...a....female....android....is....reading....it. Potentially a great story ruined by an appalling narrator, would benefit from a total read over by a professional. Wish I could get my money back, hope this helps you to save yours!"
4,Not An Epic,"Somebody has described RESURRECTION as ""not top shelf epic sf"". All I can say is that I agree...and thank goodness. Personally, my tolerance for apocalyptic sf ""epics"" is limited. I'm not looking for the ultimate galactic fate of the human race when I pick up a new book, I just want an entertaining story. That's exactly what I got from RESURRECTION. Not the greatest character development, but I cared about some of them by the end. The plot was sometimes predictable and the ending came together a little too neatly, too. That's why it doesn't get five stars. But it was enjoyable and it held my interest. It isn't DUNE, but it wasn't bad. If you're looking for a new voice in the sf genre, you might give this one a try."
2,Now with more mustache twirling villains!,"Not one for writing reviews, but wanted to warn people away from this book. I was only able to get about 35% through the book because the antagonist is too much of a stereotypical evil guy whose motives don't seem to justify the amount of crazy that comes out. Also the protagonist has way too many coincidental/unlikely things happen to them to be believable. I am an avid SciFi reader who has no trouble with suspension of disbelief (Foundation, Hyperion, Vonnegut, etc), but at one point I threw my arms up and just turned the book off. If you want a good SciFi book look elsewhere because it isn't here."
2,One-dimensional Characters with a Silly Ending,The main baddie needed a twirly mustache. He was so lame. The plot saved it from being a waste of time until the mushy romance novel ending. A few more drafts might help.
4,Very interesting concept,"Took a while to get into it, but once I did it grabbed hold of me and kept me interested through the end."
1,Don't get it,"It was not a well written story. It didn't hold my interest. I kept waiting for something to occur. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea, yet others may find it a great book."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"***No spoilers*** I borrowed this book on high recommendations from the reviews. Big disappointment. The author jumps around with so many characters, times, plants, and landscapes, it's hard to keep track of where the story has been and where it is not. This kind of storytelling is fine for a movie, but not for a book! I hate wasting a month on a borrowed book to find out the reviews are crap. I am 30%+ through the book and felt compelled to right this review. It's not a page turner and it barely makes sense."
3,Space travel,"While the concept of traveling faster than the speed of light is interesting, this story drags a bit. Also I found the multiplicity of characters sometimes confusing. There is a glossary at the end which explains the characters. Tab this as the beginning of the ebook gives no clue that this is aavailable. Story line is good."
2,"Little Character Development, Slow Plot","I went into this book expecting to love it... Between the great reviews, and that fact that I've had some success with indie Sci-Fi authors, made me confident. But, it was incredibly disappointing.The author builds the story around some great ideas. But, there's little character development and the writing is incredibly slow. If you aren't going to build the characters, then you really need the story itself to keep people on the edge of their seats - and the pace just moves too slow for that to happen."
3,"A decent story, though the writing is a little raw.","I get the feeling this was the authors first book. It had some rough edges and some little cheats. Like a group of characters with no names, just titles. There's a reason behind it, but it still feels like a cheat so the author didn't have to make up or remember names. Also, there's a line about an alien and a bird that really didn't fit. In all though, it turned out to be an interesting story. The different races and technologies make a good background to the tale. The Egyptian flashbacks were awkward at first, but led somewhere eventually. The first half of the book was a litte. Tough to get through, but I'm glad I stuck with it. There's a lot left open, so there's plenty of room for more books. Hopefully if there is a sequel, the author will be a more confident writer."
4,An interesting concept but not a new one on ancient Egypt,"History really doesn't know how the ancient Egyptians bulit their pyramids and grand statuary. The concept of alien help is not a new one. The presentation is interesting enough, so as to put forth the idea in an entertaining way. I like the characters and I think the ending was the way it should have been."
2,Don't bother,"I got this book because it was cheap and it looked like it would be good based on the reviews. The story line was interesting but that was where the good things ended. I would read it at night and within a few pages I would fall asleep because it was so boring. It was unnecessarily long and drawn out and the writing was uninspiring. If you need something to help with falling asleep at night, get this book!"
3,A little strange,"A rather odd story incorporating the ""ancient aliens"" with the pyramids. I would love to believe it! SciFi folks wont like it b/c it is just very stripped in that respect. It is not absorbing and I am reading it off and on. The ending seems predictable but I havent gotten there yet."
2,Pass on this one,"Resurrection is a science fiction book by Arwen Elys Dayton. In it, two races of people from two different planets push each other to the brink of extinction and send teams eight light years to Earth in an attempt to recover long lost technology that could propel either race to a tactical advantage against the other.The story sounds interesting and certainly sounds like the backdrop for a great SciFi novel. The problem is that the characters are underdeveloped, the settings mundane, and the book itself never really picks up any momentum. By the time the reader gets to the end of the story, you're excited not because of what you're reading, but because it's almost over.I'm surprised there are so many rave reviews for the book. This is mediocre science fiction at best."
3,It was good.,"the book was good and it needs a second, im into the sy-fy type novels like orsen scott cards books (amazing) and this bokk was up there,good overall"
1,Couldn't finish it,"I bought the book based on all of the positive reviews, but I'm sorry to say that I could not finish it. The plot had a lot of holes, many of which were totally unbelievable. In this case, melding historical fiction with science fiction does not work."
