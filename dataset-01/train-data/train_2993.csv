4,Excellent Sandwiches,"This makes great sandwiches, quesadillas, burritos. I use it for many things and love it. I also got it for my mom as a gift :)"
3,Miss the Grill Marks,"It works fine; however, a panini isn't a panini w/out the grill marks. I didn't think I'd miss them, but I did! Also, cooking eggs and pancakes on it wasn't that easy."
5,Greyhound climbs right into my truck.,"I have a crew cab truck and a greyhound who never learned tojump into a somewhat narrow opening. I opened the door, slidthe steps up against the truck frame, and my grey climbed rightinto the cab. Another problem solved, now I need to teach herhow to jump!"
2,It's an ok product but dog doesn't care for it!,"The product is satisfactory to me but not to my dog. She refuses to use it. I have coaxed her up the stairs with a treat at the top, but she uses the stairs reluctantly. Not at all, if there is no treat there. She is a stubborn dachshund."
2,"passenger side great, driver side bad","Exact fit and installs easily - Be warned it does NOT include the gasket that goes between the mirror & door; so keep the old one if possible. The matt black finish goes perfectly with the black trim around the door windows. The control wire plugs right into the factory plug. The passenger side mirror glass didn't vibrate or wobble unlike the driver's side.The driver's side is a different story. Out of three mirrors, one wobbled/vibrated & two didn't angle up far enough. For some reason they can't get the driver's side correct. Didn't want to put on the driver's side mirror for the fourth time, so I just stayed with the one that vibrates.Can give 4 stars for the passenger side, but only 1 star for the driver's side."
3,Simple Story Line Satisfies,"There is no complexity in this love story. It goes: guy sees girl, girl has boyfriend/husband, boyfriend/husband dies, and guy moves in.At least Zach Trueblood has some moral struggles when he realizes he needs to carry through on his job before he tells the woman he loves how her husband really may have died. Robbie McBride also struggles with her attraction for Zach. Her three children also seem nearly terciary characters and do not drive her in either direction as a parent.If you're looking for sheet tingling romance, this is not the book for you. The love here is very tender to the point of hesistation on both the parts of Robbie and Zach. They are aware that all eyes are on them as they reach for each other.The end is almost anti-climatic and muddled as the author sets up the romance for Francie.As a stand alone from this series, this story holds itself up, is enjoyable and provides entertainment."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book for my husband, thinking he'd enjoy it. He didn't. He couldn't identify with the author at all. I'll admit, we both howled when we read the part about attending Lamaze classes, but other than that, my husband found the book disappointing."
3,If you need a laugh...,"This book is good for what it is, a humorous look at parenting for someone about to become a dad. So, if you want a laugh (and with all the stress and uncertainty, having a reason to laugh is a good idea), this little book is the way to go. If you want some solid information on the ins and outs of fatherhood, look elsewhere."
5,I Could Read The Sky',"This is a beautifully realised film about the reminiscenses of an Irish labourer living in London. Inspired by the book of the same name, (a story told in pictures), Director Nicola Bruce creates a claustrophobic atmosphere as the old man tells his tale from his tiny bedsit, of his isoation, loss and loneliness. The man is portrayed with great sensitivity by poet Dermot Healy, whose rythms of speech help form the character & the pace of the film. Stephen Rae makes an appearance, as does Sean Nos singer iarla O'Lionaird."
5,Outstanding!,"This is the best child's book I have seen so far. I read it to my 7 year old son and I loved it as much as he did. I have been to Venice and I learned a lot of new things that I did not know. The story is interesting in a travelogue sort of way and the illustrations are wonderful and varied. The only similar book that comes close would be The Three Golden Keys about Prague. As a previous reviewer stated it would be great if there was a book about every city like this. Although a child's book it is quite substantial, beautifully produced, and well worth the money."
3,Book Club Review,"This book was read and reviewed for a mother-daughter book club that I attend. It's a book club of six, nine-year old girls with their respective mothers. None of the girls liked this book. They all found it rather boring.The mothers and I can understand how the girls could find this book dry, but it was highly informative and the girls learned a great deal about Venice. We all agreed that we wanted to see Venice one day. This book was very thorough in explaining the history and traditions of Venice. I personally liked that quality.We read another book a few months ago entitled ""The Diary of Melanie Martin"". It was a book about a young girl's travels in Italy. The girls in the book club enjoyed that one much more because they were able to get into the thoughts of the main character. While with this book, they got more information on Venice than on the character. I'm sure if Vendela's adventures were more exciting than informative, they would have enjoyed the book more."
1,No help with diaper pail,"Since this seemed to work so well near litter boxes, I tried this near my diaper pail and noticed absolutely ZERO difference. I change the diaper pail daily too. It may be good for litter boxes (I don't have a cat), but it's no good for diaper pails. Just FYI for all the parents out there."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Don't waste your money on any of these ""Smell Killers!"" I have had one for 3 weeks now and it hasn't helped ANY smell one bit! I have a range of odors in my house - dog, cat, rabbit, cooking, etc. - and it has not eliminated anything! It is really just a piece of stainless steel sitting in a glass dish with some water in it, not covering it. If you want it for a paperweight, buy it. If you'd like to get rid of odors, buy a spray or something. Don't buy this! I wish I hadn't!"
5,eight cats and seven litter boxes,"I have three litter boxes in the upstairs bedroom of a three floor town-house condo. I like the performance of the Smellkiller SO much in that room, that I'm getting two more--one for the basement (four litter boxes) and one for the main floor--so we'll have total coverage. Once I remembered to check the water level every other day or so--evaporation, you know--it worked like a charm."
5,Smellkiller Air Cleanser,"Amazingly, this thing works great. I was skeptical, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a try. We placed them in our basement, and the musty smell is GONE!Great product. Only con would be the need to keep water in it."
5,Best value for the money,"I've had my FM25B for several years now and can say it's way better then all the other coil and resister tunned Stereo transmitters I've used. This transmitter is a must if your using a newer digitaly tuned radio. The older transmiters drifted too much, what would make this kit even better is if Ramsey offered an RDS add on kit."
3,Muy poca potencia,"Es muy estable pero le falta un poco mas de potencia, tiene muy poco campo de cobertura."
3,"Not Bad, Not Outstanding","I was anxiously awaiting the release of this supplement and while the writing, gameplay and new chararcters are a lot of fun and well worth the money, be warned: the interior artwork is horrid. Some looks as though it was drawn with the artists' off-hand and in my opinion it can be very distracting. Better to have no art of very little but solid artwork than what's presented here for the most part, that which looks rushed at best and amateurish at worst. One caveat: the cover art is outstanding! :)Definitely worth picking up if good art if not a priority."
1,Dont even think about it.....,I had been using philips adapter that i got from Walmart and was quite satisfied with it until the wire broke when it got entangled. I bought this one just because it was MAXELL and i had to make 25$ in order to qualify for free shipping. But the moment i inserted it in my stereo i realized my mistake. It sounded terrible. The very same day i went to walmart and picked up philips adapter once again. You can try others as well but dont even think about this one....
2,loses quality over time,"This product was great at first, the sound was perfect. A few months later I noticed the quality was slowly getting worse. A year later and I'm on amazon searching for a new one. The sound is so muffled that I can't hear the lyrics from many songs, esp. songs with any synthesizers. I would not recommend this particular adapter to anyone who wants to use it for more than a few months."
5,good buy,easy to use works perfect and sounds good. good deal for us with older cars and cant afford a full mp3 hook up
4,"Definitely gets the job done, and not in a terrible way.","The older Maxell cassette adapters didn't have the audio filter that these new ones do. The old ones would generate an insane amount of bass, and couldn't deal with the extra fuzz from your mp3 players pre-amp. This new P-10 cassette adapter has a filter on it which results in lower bass, but you can crank your mp3 player up and not get all the static and fuzz that you would normally get. From what I've exerpienced, I can play music louder without it getting all scratchy. This, of course, only applies if you aren't using low quality mp3's."
2,surprising from Maxell,sound quality is poor with the cassette adapter and i would not recomend them to anyone unfortunately.
2,Not for a stock 97 F150,"I tried multiple times to get this thing going, but it was no use. It plays for about two seconds, switches ""sides,"" and plays for about two more seconds, and then gets spit out of the radio. Honestly, though, I have no idea whether it is just the radio, or the adapter, as I have not tried to get it to work in anything else. But, like the title says, it is NOT for a '97 F150."
1,Tape deck adapter,This product was a poor one. While my music device was playing in made a very loud noise inside the tape deck of my used car. I wouldn't buy this product at any cost ever again.
2,"It works, but not perfectly","First of all, something like this should cost less than $7, $10 at the most.Initially, the spindles makes squeaky noises, so I open the unit up to see how I can stop the squeaking. I soon found out that the spindle served no purpose at all for the particular head unit in my car (some tape decks require certain amount of tension in the spindle or it will stop). So I took out the spindle and the thing is as quiet as it could be. I also experimented with the flipping the adapter and switching the side A/B button on the head unit, and found that a certain combination works better than others.The cable is long, much longer than what was needed, so I stuffed most of it inside the case to minimize clutter (this is a DIY modification which you have to open up the case)."
2,Throw a wet blanket over your speakers...,"and this will give you an idea of the sound quality you will get from this particular product. While it delivers as far as getting your MP3 player to play through you cassette system, the very poor and muffled sound quality offsets this benefit. As far as cassette adapters go, I've gone through a few and the Sony brand has delivered far superior sound quality at the same price. While Maxell does make fine quality cassette tapes, I would avoid their cassette adapter."
4,Works as Advertised,This product simply worked as advertized. The quality of music from my mp3 player through my car's premium sound system does not appear to be degraded in any way. If you have a cassette player on your car's sound system and you enjoy listening to your mp3 player then this product is a must.
2,Slow Paced,"I must agree with the other reviewers. I enjoyed previous novels by Christopher Hyde and bought this based on them. But, unfortunately, this was a very tedious slow paced read. Even with appearances by Ian Fleming and James Bond. There were a few good parts. But it was really too painful to get to them."
2,Disappointing!,"I've enjoyed many of Christopher Hyde's books and so I bought his latest, An American Spy, on the strength of his reputation alone. However, much to my disappointment, An American Spy could not maintain my interest. The plot took much too long to develop, the main characters were not very interesting, the dialogue was a bit unrealistic and the thrills did not come fast enough and were somewhat tepid. The only enjoyable aspect of the book for me pertained to Hyde's description of England during WWII, which served as the backdrop for the story involving the murder of an American officer and unsettling implications of treason by a band of U,S. soldiers. As a result, I soon developed a 'who cares' attitude and ultimately gave up on the book about two-thirds of the way into it. If you are interested in historical fiction I'd recommend Chritopher Hyde's The Second Assasin and Wisdom Of The Bones."
1,Unreadable,"I could not agree with the previous reviewer more. The reader cannot grasp anything resembling a plot until about 150 pages in, and even then it's nothing that hasn't been done much better before. I gave up on it about 2/3 of the way through as well."
3,Yawn!,This is my second Christopher Hyde book and to this point I am underwhelmed. The book has WWII England as a setting. Jane Todd is a New York based war correspondent who is sent to work with the J.A.G. office investigating the death of an Amercan serviceman. What follows is a garbed mess. They soon find themselves hot on the trail of a rich American who appears to be in cahoots with the Nazis. What a mess.
3,"A good idea, but...","Like a lot of the cervical pillows on the market, this one is just too darn tall for most people. It sits a good 5"" or so off of the bed, which is fine for most back sleepers, but side sleepers probably won't like it. Also, by the time you put the recommended starting amount of water in the pillow it weighs a TON. You'll probably re-injure your back just lifting this puppy!!Overall, I was disappointed and my search for the perfect pillow must continue."
5,damaged hair,"This conditioner is excellent! My hair has been quite damaged and this product helps smooth it and make it look healthier. I spend a lot of money on my hair (my one indulgence) and so I'm willing to purchase really good hair products to keep it looking good. The damage I have is not from the hair processing, but rather because I had major surgery and lost a lot of weight and much of it fell out. I will be purchasing this again."
4,How the Dispossessed Turned to Pentecostalism,Correction: Vision of the Disinherited was first published in 1979 by Oxford Univ. Press
1,Frommer's was much better!,"We took our family and went to Maui. Armed with 3 guide books, I was able to compare the content and accuracy of them while on the island.I found Frommer's book to be a little outdated. More to the point, I found it to be lacking a lot of information that the other two books had. I do not recommend that anyone purchase this book. Maybe their tour books for other islands are better..."
3,Now I know why they Bite!,"I have very tiny feet. These shoes were my size, 6, but even my little feet were too crowded in there. A half size up might work? Really great color and very sturdy. The inserts that came with the shoes were wonderful, but No Way would they fit in there since my feet were stuffed in the shoes without the liners. I have noted this problem before with this brand, with the sizing being difficult to figure out."
5,The Way of the Cross/Stations of the Cross,"This is an exquistely done CD of the Stations of the Cross by St. Alphonsus Liguori with the Sabat Mater sung between each station. The background music for each station beautifully compliments each meditation. Finally, I have found the version of the stations that I grew up with! Thank you, David Phillips, for this beautiful treasure!"
2,Heartburn.,"I have made several shakes with cocoa powder, whey, agave syrup, and non-fat milk (my normal mixture) and ended up with heartburn. I have used another natural brand of whey with these same ingredients for months with no problems, so I suspect this brand might be the culprit. It does mix well."
4,"Great natural alternative to ""designer"" protein powders","This product is packaged well (it comes in a display box with the four packages) and was just what I was hoping for. It sits nicely in my pantry.I was looking for a natural alternative to commercially marketed and artificially sweetened protein powders and this fits the bill perfectly. I use it for making smoothies and the taste is a bit bland but I add one tablespoon organic honey and it gives it just the right amount of sweetness.For a great tasting smoothie with this product mix 1/4 c. apple juice, 1/4 c. soymilk, one handful spinach (yes spinach, you don't even taste it in the smoothie and it will give you a great energy boost), 1 T. flaxseeds, 1 T. organic honey, 1 cup berries, 1 sml banana, ice, and 1/4 c. Bob's Mill Whey Protein Powder Concentrate. Mix in blender until smooth. Ultra good for you and delicious to boot!"
3,Yukky aftertaste,"I put this in smoothies for my older kids (my sons lift weights and run), but they complain about the aftertaste (It helps if I use less). They don't seem to notice when I add it to low fat muffins or to pancakes. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the product, but will likely look for something with less taste."
3,Great whey -- incomplete description,"BRM makes great products and is well known for organics. I buy them and recommend them. This one didn't show that the product contains soy lecithin. It's on the bag ingredients list. If you don't mind soy, but it. If you want to avoid soy products, look around."
5,McDonald & Motown Once Again,"In this world where the current artists have names I can't even understand and play music that is also way too hot for me, it is great to know that we have MM c continuing to provide a product that is great. Even some of my really hip friends were making positive comments about the album content, musicians and guests. I really have enjoyed the DVD and would recommend it to anyone, if you are a closed fan of Motown music, you may have to buy the CD and play it in your car alone, seems as though someone always joins me from other rooms when I play this."
2,You get what you pay for,A deal at $50.00 but certainly not a superior marine product. I had a similar looking & described seabold product and was greatly disappointed in this model.
4,The Brazilian dictionary,"In Brazil dictionaries go with the nickname of Aurelio, of obvious derivation.This is a quite complete dictionary, slightly less complete and up-to-date than its recent competitor Houaiss, but its entries are more concise, clearer, conform better to the official and colloquial norms of spelling, and sometimes even have a better flavour.It does come in inferior binding, though — plan for rebinding it after a few months' intensive usage.If you really want something up to the minute, wait a few months for a new edition by a new publisher, Positivo — it may receive a better binding then too.Be warned it is not a full-length dictionary as the Oxford English Dictionary or the French Robert, if you really want something like it check dictionaries from Portugal or wait some months for a promised new edition of Caldas Aulete."
3,Don't rush to buy this...,"The price is right and so is the size...but really, this isn't such a great buy. The zipper is awful. You have to keep yanking it as it doesn't zip smoothly and it gets stuck a lot. Also, the green has bled onto the bag itself and therefore, I imagine it's bled onto other things...namely clothing? Not certain about that but it stands to reason."
1,Didn't last long,It worked ok at first and after about twenty uses it started spraying everywhere almost like there was no more seal on it. I washed it by hand every time so I know I hasn't been destroyed by being put in the dishwasher. Very unhappy with product.
4,Amateur Juicer,"I am just beginning to juice. This machine is user friendly and making fun blends. Its pretty sturdy, hence somewhat noisy when juicing. That doesnt take away from its performance. I got a good deal on it thru Amazon. Overall I am pleased."
5,towel lover,"I bought this juice extractor after watching Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, the new documentary on sick and overweight Americans. An excellent DVD by the way. This is the exact juicer used by the makers of the film, so I looked it up on Amazon. Many excellent reviews, so I went for it. VERY easy to use. Easy cleanup and operates very quickly to make the juice, which was very tasty. I used the recipe in the film as I had a lot of experience with fruit smoothies, but not veggie drinks. This is a great machine."
1,Don't recommend!!!!!,"I chose this juicer based on all the reviews I read here. I've had it now for two weeks and have used it almost everyday. This juicer is too powerful for its own good. Too loud, too much pulp (and yes I did follow the directions) and too much froth. I got the Jack Lalane juicer today and have none of the same problems. It's quiet, hardly any pulp and guess what it doesn't come with a de-frother because it doesn't need one!!!!This juicer did not live up to the expectations of these reviews. Only good thing is that clean up was very easy."
5,5 Big Gold Stars,"This is my 3rd juicer and by far the best. The others left juicy pulp and/or were hard to clean. My Breville, dry pulp, rinse and put the 3 pieces back together. I love it so much, I purchased one for my Father and boyfriend. Now they are faithful juicers!"
4,Fast Extracting Easy Cleaning Machine,"We had the Jack Lalane juicer prior to this one and since we purchased the Breville, we have not been dissapointed & its been 2 months of activity, my wife juices about 10-12 times per week and so far so good. Its a lot faster and extracts better. To clean is an ease and easy to assemble & dissamble. I actually paid more for the Jack Lalane juicer by $35 yet the Breville is worth it especially when the cost and shipping were all about $90."
4,A good machine for people on the go...,"I've been using my Breville every day for over a month now. This machine suits my needs because it juices the fastest I have every seen and also because it is easy and quick to disassemble, wash, and assemble back. The downsides of this machine are: (1) the motor is a little too noisy, and (2) the pulp released is still moist, so it does not release 100% of the juices, particularly of soft fruits like berries and pineapple. However, for me, a very busy person who's always on the go, this machine suits my needs perfectly. Before buying Breville, I had two other juicing machines which were a hassle to assemble and wash, and I lost motivation to juice on a daily basis. Not so with Breville!"
3,Note: Extremely large juicer!,"This looks like a well-made, sturdy juicer. Only one problem: it's huge. I took it out of the box and it was gigantic- much taller and wider than even my giganto Kitchen-Aid mixer with attachments. My counter could not accomodate this behemoth. However, if you have the space, this looks like a really nice piece of equipment. It was with regret that I returned this and am still in search of a sturdy (but less massive) juicer."
5,Just wanted to make a note on the length of warranty,"I read all of the great reviews and wanted to point out something that I found while researching this juicer. A lot of customers have compared it to the Jack LaLane juicer. I don't see it written on this site, but saw this juicer on another site that states it has a 1-year LMW. The Jack LaLane juicer only has a 90 LMW, which is one reason I didn't buy it. I think it is an important difference."
5,JE900 Juicer,"I owned a previous juicer which was difficult to clean and inefficient. The Breville is a pleasant change. Quite easy to disassemble, clean, and reassemble. Cleaner juice - less particulates. It takes up a fair amount of counter space, but worth it. A good value."
5,Can't go wrong!,"I couldnt be happier with my Breville juicer. Never heard of Breville before. Almost bought a Jack Lalane juicer,until i saw the features of the Breville.Bigger wattage and faster rpm makes for faster juicing. There are times when i dont even have to use the plunger to push the fruit and veggies through. A little noisy,but no more than most small appliances i have had! Looks good sitting on top of the countertop.Very e-z clean-up. And $99 with free super saver shipping makes this a good value."
5,A wonderful juicer,I bought this juicer for my mother and she loves it. She use it all the time to make juice. The opening is big enough to put large pieces of fruit or vegetable. Extract lots of juice leaving the pulp almost dry. Easy to clean up and maintain.
5,Bravo for the Breville JE900!!!,I purchased the Breville 1 month ago and I am so pleased with everything about it. The juice is awesome -- the clean-up is fantastic and the unit it so easy to operate. My kids love the carrot and apple combination while I love the benefits of the fresh juice they're drinking. I highly recommend this model if you're looking for a great juicer!
2,Disappointing,"We returned this. We were very disappointed for a number of reasons. It was far too labor intensive: clean-up took way too much time. It was messy and splattered. And most importantly, after trying a number of recipes, we thought the juices were awful, medicinal-tasting. We're sticking with Bolthouse Farms juices."
3,WTH do I do????,How do I return it or get an exchange????????I used it once a week since I bought it and today Buff motor died havent even been that long its scary cause I want another cause I bought it for a reason My Daughters Health this has been the easiest way to get her to drink her Fiber
2,Juice Fountain,"The stuff that was removed liquid is still wet. When it is returned to the inlet of the machine, still liquid is comming out. This means centrifugal separation is still not enough. Suggest your modification.NobuyoshiBreville JE900 Juice Fountain Professional Juice Extractor"
1,Don't buy this product!,"I purchased this juicer a year and a half ago, and have not juiced regularly. Had I done so, it probably wouldn't have lasted more than 6 months. It's poorly constructed, with sharp edges, which makes it difficult to clean. At first, it juiced adequately for the price, but now it refuses to do the job of a juicer. The pulp no longer finds its way into the bin, and it collects around and on top of the blade, with less juice. Juicing carrots is a nightmare because it seems to stress the motor."
4,Excellent choice,"I bought this item two weeks ago and have used it every day. It is powerful and cleanup is easy. Everything about the design and performance is better than I could have expected for the low price. It takes whole, small apples, or several big carrots at a time. The only problem I had was that two or three times the locking mechanism didn't sit properly before I used the machine. Some small damage resulted to one of the plastic pieces, which doesn't seem to affect performance. I find I have to be extra careful now to be sure that all the pieces are fitting together tightly before use. When a friend who has the same machine used mine, he repeated the same error. I plan to ask the company if this is a normal occurrance or if it's a fluke with my machine."
1,Juice is foamy and not much; lots of wet pulp and chunks of fruit in pulp jar,"I ordered this juicer and impatiently waited for a week after reading so many good wrtie ups on this site. Much to my surprise, I was extremely disappointed. I tried it within hours of receiving it and got 8-OZ of fruit out of 6 apples and a pear. My cheap old black and decker ($30) does better than that! This thing shoots out big chuncks of fruit and very wet pulp into the pulp jar like you wouldn't believe. It goubles up fruits without jouicing them in less than 3 seconds. I would only recommend it to some one I don't like."
2,"juices fine, but wait until you need to order parts!","We accidentally damaged a plastic part to our JE900 and ordered a replacement. The order process is cumbersome (their 800 number is a voicemail drop, and you wait for a callback ... sometime). When the part finally arrived, it was the WRONG part. The invoice showed they shipped the correct part, but it doesn't fit the JE900. We're still waiting a call back on this. I'm betting our JE900 will wind up in the junk pile, since we wouldn't buy another one given this experience."
5,Great juicer. Easy Clean up,"This is my first juicer and I am completely satisfied with it. It has a large chute and handles everything that I have tried to juice with no problems. Clean-up is very easy as long as it is done immediately after use. A helpful tip is to use plastic bags in the pulp collector so you can just discard the bag after use without needing a major cleaning.The loud motor is the only thing that I don't like, but for me it is not that big of a deal."
5,Incredibly pleased!!!,"I bought this juicer from Amazon based on other reviews. It appered to have a pretty solid 5 star rating, now I know why!!!It is amazing. It exceeded my expectations!!!It is VERY fast. It was a little loud , but not as bad as I had expected. I'd have to say it's noise level is comperable to a vacuum. The only thing that I have to disagree with is the manufacturer's statement that it will juice whole large apples. I do need to cut them in half. But, in the big picture, it's really not a big deal for this quality piece of equiptment!!!!!"
1,high-speed mess!,"I exchanged a Juiceman Jr (also reviewed) for this. First two things I noticed:the locking handle takes a bit of force to use, and yes, it's loud, although I quickly adapted to the noise.The stickers claim it will juice whole apples, but this is true only if they are medium or small. You will have to cut most apples at least in half.The big problem: I gave it a difficult test, juicing 8 spears of broccoli. It thoroughly juiced them, ejecting very dry, fluffy pulp out one end and lots of juice out the other. However, the blade is so high-speed that little pulp missiles shot out the very small gaps between the clear cover and the pulp canister. The missiles landed in a large radius around the machine and moved fast enough to cause a mild sting on contact.I tried using a damp towel to cover the chute and receptacle, but the wind from the blade was sufficient to lift the towel and let pulp escape.Because of the mess, I would not recommend this product."
5,Wonderful piece of equipment,"After serious resarch I decided to purchase it a week ago. This machine is everything the manufacturer claims it to be, and then some.This is my first juicer the truth...it's worth every penny. Strong motor w/o much noise easy to clean. I never thught that juicing could be this easy and fast. I love the quality construction, and simplicity of this machine, and recommended to anyone interested in becoming a juicer. I give it seven stars!!!"
5,Very good one,"I liked it verymuch. Especially it is very useful to make carrot, beat juices. Apples juices are excellent. The wastage is very less when making apple juice.Donot use this for Orange juices.Careful when adding ginger while making carrot juices. Add at the end."
4,My first juicer,"I bought this juicer a couple months ago on Amazon.com. It looks good on the counter and works good. The only thing I don't like is the fact that when I'm loading fruit or veggies in it, I have to cover the opening quick so peices don't fly back out. Also, some pulp, ( very little ) comes out around the top of the pulp container."
5,Simply THE BEST friend on your kitchen counter!,"I carefully select all my kitchen tools, especially when they cost $50 and more, but this one is one of my all times favorite! Do NOT hesitate and bring it home to you! Enjoy healthy, easy-made and delicious drinks and meals just 10 seconds away from you! And even the looks of it is top-designer item!"
1,Not that Impressed,"I actually got this one back a few years ago... and haven't liked it... but just delt with it. it seems that it spins so fast that most of the fruit/vegetable gets chucked out the discard container... i was surprised to see such an overall good review... maybe i just got a dud! regardless, i'm in the market looking for something that doesn't waste so much!"
5,Awesome juicer!,"This is my first juicer, bought based on recommendations here. I love it! It's so powerful, I cranked through well over a gallon of juice (freezing it in 16 oz water bottles). It's so easy to clean up. I'm thrilled with it. I had never tasted simple carrot juice before, what a treat. Everyone at work is turning up their nose at my tomato/green pepper/celery/lime juice--that's ok, it's my secret just how good it is, and good for me."
3,"Good juicer, but there are better","I got the JE900 from my local Costco thinking it would be similar to my sister's Breville BJE200XL juicer. They are similar juicers, however the BJE200XL is better and is a very similar price. For a start, the BJE200XL is Breville's successor to the JE900. The BJE has fewer parts and therefore is easier and faster to clean. Also my JE900 had a very tiny leak on the left side where, when it was juicing, it would occasionally spit out tiny bits of pulp towards me. I promptly returned it and am going with the BJE200XL which is a newer and better model. The JE900 isn't bad, but since the price is similar..."
5,Absolutely Amazing Machine,"I had a whole mess of grapefruit sent to me from family in Florida.. after quickly peeling the fruit (required for citrus,) this machine created over a 1/2 a gallon of grapefruit juice lightening fast! We tried whole apples and were amazed by the amount of juice that comes from one apple - and how quickly. Like others have said, the machine is super easy to clean and built well. It comes with my highest recommendation."
2,Is horrible,"Now this is my first juicer so I do not have much to go on, however, the pulp does seem to be very moist. I do not feel like I am getting all the juice out of it that I should be getting. (Grapefruit/orange juice actually had juice in with pulp... no good). When juicing, juice seems to spray a little all over my kitchen. I do love having a juicer, however, I am starting to doubt all the other reviews on this item due to my own experiences. I may have invested more money for a more effective juicer since my efforts are being wasted into the pulp. Easy to clean though.Now months later, only used it 4 times because it leaves a spray mess all over the kitchen. The pulp includes huge chunks of fruit and vegis and the pulp is not dry. I am wasting lots of juice. I whish I could return it, this juicer sucks!!!!!"
5,Best Juicer ever,I purchased the Breville JE900 Juice Fountain. This is the best juicer I have ever owned. It took me a few days to realize that this juicer gets so much juice out of the fruit and vegetable like no other I owned before. I couldn't be happier. Cleaning is fast and easy. I will never own an other juicer again.
3,not as good as LaLane,This juicer leaves a lot of very moist pulp. My old jack lalane did much better and i am sorry now that i replaced it with the Breveille
4,juice master,"Professionally made, well crafted. Very good juicer, but leaks a bit all around and doesn't filter the best. My wife and I like crystal clear juice and we have to filter it again."
4,It's working for me,"I was deciding between the lalane juicer and this. This one had more power. When you switch it on u know this thing has power. It juices great and is easy to clean. Throw a bag in the pulp collector and itz even easier. Foam is an issue but you can just skim that off or shake it up with the juice. That's about it, I recommend it."
3,Little disappointed,"After receving my Breville JE900 Juice Fountain Professional Juice Extractor, I wish I had spent the additional few dollars and order the Montel Williams HealthMaster Living Well. Oh well next time. Too loud and too many parts to clean."
5,Great Product,"This product totally exceeded my expectations! I researched various juicer options before settling on the Breville. I almost doubted that it would perform to the specs because the price was surprisingly competitive. I would say that it is one of the best values for the money that I've seen. I've had it for nearly a month and I've juiced beets, apples, kale, celery, tomatoes, carrots and it has performed stupendously. I would definitely recommend this juicer as a great value."
4,Lasted about 3 years,"We got this juicer in 2008 and used it to make four glasses of juice a day daily until February 2011. We were concerned about the amount of pulp produced, but when we tried blending the same fruits & veggies we used in a juicer we ended up with about the same amount of material.The juicer had to be replaced when the blade/mesh assembly started to fall apart, and the capture bowl was also beginning to develop cracks. We replaced it with the Breville Ikon. For our replacement, we were considering an Omega with the 10 year warranty instead, but didn't like the negative reviews we saw for it here on Amazon.Pros:Fairly efficient at extracting juice.Good price.Hassle free until it started to break down.Cons:Lots of pulp waste. Great if you mulch.This one is advertised as easy to clean, but you still need a toothbrush to get inside the juice dispenser.Sometimes juice leaks out of the pitcher if it is not completely flush with the juicer."
5,Every morning,I can make a liter of juice in about a minute. I bought this for home and it would be fantastic for a health food restaurant of juice bar. For the fantastic quality you are getting far more for your money than any other juicer on the market. It's worth a lot more than I paid for it and this juicer deserves more than 5 stars. I make juice every morning and there is nothing so easy and fast to use.
5,Rocks!,"I've had mine for almost a year and still use it minimum 5 times per week -that's how easy it is too clean. You can make juice and clean up in about/under 10 minutes once you get the hang of it. I think the key is washing fruit/veggies when you get them cause there is no need to peel, core, or de-seed most fruits w/ this juicer. As others have said line the ""pulp cathcer"" with a plastic grocery store bag. Bonus is the size of veggies and fruit it can handle (no it won't do an entire apple but will do half or 2 ginormous carrots) and does almost all veggies/fruit compared to other juicers. If you have never used a juicer before read the directions - has good tips and directives for cleaning the blade. Oh - papya juice makes a kickin' margarita and all juicers are loud 8-)"
4,Very Pleased!,"In comparison with all of the juicers I found, this juicer is very good quality for the price. I rarely have to chop anything before I juice it. The only preparation needed is rinsing the fruits and veggies. Although it is quite loud, it is very powerful and only takes seconds to make huge portions of juice. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,I'm convinced!,"Hi all, I usually don't write reviews but I just had to give my 2 cents on the Breville JE900 juicer. This machine is fantastic! Its very powerful and can juice just about anything. Clean up is very easy as you can rinse all of parts in minutes. It is a bit loud, but its not on for long and its ease of use makes up for it.Here's a recipe for a great juice I've been making that tastes great. 3 carrots, 1/2 of one red bell pepper, 2 apples (fuji) and 1 lemon, skin and all. If you want it a bit less tart use only half a lemon. Yum, yum!!! Try it, you'll love it."
5,Not a Piece of Junk Juicer!,This juicer arrived and I used it the same day. It is powerful and easy to take apart and clean. I was very skeptical in buying a juice machine but am glad I choose THIS one and no piece of junk that I would be dissatisifed with. Don't try to buy a less expensive juice machine.
5,Loud but proud,"I had wanted to get a juicer since I read a book on raw foods. This one was highly recommended, and when it came on sale on Amazon.com, I decided to purchase it. I have not been unhappy - this is a fast and sturdy machine that makes quick work out of my selection of fruits and veggies. I can't believe the amount of juice that I have been getting from this machine! I expected very little but was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly a few apples, etc. would lead to a full pitcher of juice. What's especially nice about this contraption is the ease of cleanup. It is very straightforward and easy to deal with.Other reviewers mentioned that it was loud, I do agree - it sounds like an airplane landing. But who cares when you get the quality and quantity of juice? I would buy this juicer again."
1,Aweful Service At Breville,"Our juicer had issues after a few months.Customer Service at Breville is horrible.It was a long time before they sent me a replacement.After all the calls and headaches, you wonder if it's worth it.Nightmare."
1,wood chipper in an apple orchard,"I ordered this product to make healthy juice drinks. When it came I opened the box, washed all the parts and assembled it as per the instructions. I got out my organic fruit and turned on the juicer. My first clue should have been that it sounded like a wood chipper but I went forward. This machine threw pulp chips out past the collection bag, basket and all over me and my kitchen. It took an hour to clean up the mess and repackage the machine and in the process, I spilled the glass of juice. I was very disappointed with the engineering of the product and understand I will have to pay shiping both directions, for a product that makes a mess that wasn't honestly and clearly discribed in the on line description.R Rice MD"
4,Breville JE900 Juicer,The wife is very happy with this juicer. It does everything the writeup it says it will. It is great for juicing to make soups with the juice and the pulp.
2,I really didn't like this juicer,"This is the first Amazon review I have written. I bought this juicer after seeing how popular it is, but I returned it after one use. This is a beautiful and fast appliance, but I don't think the juice is as healthy other ""older"" juicers out there. Plus, I really hated the noise. I felt like I was killing a small animal.I did a froth/taste test with an old school Champion juicer and the Breville juice 1) had TONS more frothy stuff, 2) didn't taste as rich, 3) had parts that were easy to clean, but TOO big. I'm much happier with my hand-me-down Champion.If you are juicing a couple times a week for yourself and want the healthiest juice possible (enzymes included!), DON'T buy the Breville. It's a pretty package without any personality."
2,Having trouble with the Breville-Releasing the top,"The machine makes good juice, but this is the third time I cannot make the top release, and I've used this gift only five times total! Take off the upper 'feeder' portion, and try to release, turning to the right as the instructions direct, but it won't come off.Does anyone have a problem getting the metal grinding spool and its lower plastic housing to release? It seems like a fairly cheap mechanism; I either have a defective machine or others have a similar problem."
2,Not Impressed!,"My Moline 104 Juicer broke down this morning after almost 10 years of use. I use a juicer at least three times a week to make a vegetable juice (for the most part, beets, carrots, celery, parsley, green peppers). I needed a replacement and I bought this model because it looked like the only decent model available at the local stores. I tried it right away and, frankly, was not impressed. Considering the price, the quality just did not measure up - light plastic (part of the top cover came in chipped right out of the box), juice splatters all over the countertop, lots of juice left in the pulp. I am returning it. Will be contacting Moline Customer Service - turns out, their juicer has 15 year warranty."
4,so far so good!,"I've had the juicer for a month now and i use it all the time. its extremely easy to use and pretty powerful. you definitely need some counter space as its not tiny. i like my citrus fruits and after peeling them this juicer makes great oj as well. favorite combo so far is apple, orange, lemon, carrot. enjoy!"
5,Quality product!,"I received the Breville JE900 Juice Extractor as a wedding present. We immediately put it to use, and with wonderful results! The claim that you can juice whole apples is absolutely true (if they are small in size). I also had expected the machine to be much louder than it actually is. Clean up is a breeze if you take the recommendation to put a plastic bag in the pulp container. All in all, this is a wonderful appliance that has more than exceeded my expectations."
2,Beautiful but edges dull quickly,"Knives are beautiful and are elegant for display, but they quickly lose their sharp edge."
1,Substandard Mikasa Steak Knives,"Although I've been satisfied with Mikasa products in the past,the steak knife set was most disappointing. The constructionwas flimsy, particularly the handles. I would have beenembarrassed to give them as a gift. When I returned them, Iwas charged a fee because ""it was my fault that I returned theknives."" I beg to differ. It was the fault of Mikasa and throughthem Amazon for offering such a shoddy product. I'll be morewary in the future in dealing with Amazon."
2,Broad overview on gaming,"This book gives a broad overview on the gaming industry and heavily uses Electronic Arts in most of its examples. In fact, I would not be surprised if it was endorsed by EA. Because of this narrow focus, the book largely largely ignores other companies that are doing innovative things in gaming. To this effect it does nothing to predict the success of Guitar Hero. And although EA has successful titles, it also fails to present the many other ones that have failed. It paints an all too rosy picture.The frameworks used to analyze the industry are also too sweeping and broad with little analysis involved. The prose is oftentimes subjective. All in all, the industry could have been represented more objectively and analytically."
5,Quite a Challenge!,"Clicko is the toughest of the 4 ""structure"" books that all work with the same 18 blocks (See also Tangramino, Architecto, and Equilibrio). Clicko should only be used after some familiarity with any or all of these 3 books. With Clicko, drawings are give of a certain view of an object and blocks are specified with which to build. It's an excellent challenge for adults as well as older kids. I recommend all of these sets highly. Expensive, but well worth it! (buy only one set with blocks then add books to supplement)."
5,Best Ever....,"Seems that people hate this game, I dont think so. It is the best version of Jeopardy yet. It has many more features, for a very cheap price.Thanks, John"
5,"Gave them as a gift, very nice quality",I gave these spoons to a friend when I saw that she did not have small enough spoons for placing in little bowls of grated cheese at Thanksgiving. She really liked them. Good price ($10).
2,Disappointing,"I am a HUGE fan of Jenny Han's Summer I Turned Pretty series, but this book just wasn't that great."
4,Cute,"I thought Shug was good, definitely worth a read but this book didn't really make my day. I thought it WAS good though this isn't supposed to put you off reading it.It really is very realistic. A twelve year old who falls in love with her best friend and then he begins to slope off and she goes through watching him fall for a girl she hates. I thought it was well written."
1,Worst Book Ever,"I picked up this book because of the cover, but it wasn't as exciting as the cover looked. It had a bad story line, it wasn't suspensful, and it wasn't interesting at all!! I would not have finished this boook if it wasn't for a school assignment."
4,Sugar!,Shug and Marc have been best friends forever. Since they were babies. But things have changed. She loves Marc and he only notices her older sister.Annemarie AKA Shug goes through the hard times all pre-teens face and the hardships of parents caught up in fighting and themselves.Annemarie's mother drinks and her father never comes home anymore.In with the bitter there is humor and it is an over all a very lovable book that will have you cheering on Annemarie.
5,Very cool toy,"I got my kid this toy and he loves it. I have a bike myself and we like to watch the OCC guys on TV so when I saw this I thought it would be perfect for him. It is cool that you build the bike frame yourself out of the knex pieces and the precast bike parts attach to them. This model is not for rough play but better just to build and look at and then build into something else. That's the fun part though, he can make whatever he wants. I bought him the Paul Sr. Old School bike and am saving it for his birthday. I know he'll love it and I'll keep adding to his OCC collection with whatever K'nex comes out with."
4,Grandson chopper Knex lover,This is a fun toy for the Knex/ Lego builders. This is not for a beginner but if they love Knex/ Legos and choppers they will love this.
5,A Look Into a Great Mind,"A semi-autobiographical look into the world of David Cronenberg and how he came to make films of grotsque, yet, captivating life of media, biology and society. You will read about his influences in his early childhood life and then, eventually, virtually being the only Canadian film director with a promise. Cronenberg seems humble in his writing, yet, you get a sense of high intelligence. Definately reccomended! It is a good read, moves along nicely and you will be quite fascinated by his personal accounts of his world and what inspires him."
4,a great start,"""Cronenberg on Cronenberg"" is a great start for anyone who wants further insight on David's work, specially his early films. One musn't hesitate, this is the basic fan purchase."
3,You still need a teacher,"This book contains very little in the way of ""how"" to play the violin - how to hold the instrument and the bow, how to use the bow, etc. For this, you will need a teacher."
3,pretty great,"the book explains things in a simple and drirect manner, I would definately recomend it as a useful tool along with an actual instructor."
3,Nice Book Very Basic for the Beginner,I would recommend this book. It is very basic and great for the new musician in your family rather adult or child.
3,Really for an absolute beginner,"This book is for an absolute beginner. This book is mainly Containing children's songs (nursery rhythm) which is very useful for me. But, the CD is not good,I think the CD shows some video clip or something like that. NO, it just contains a copy of the book."
3,Ok book for violin starter,"If you know nothing about music, this book will be very difficult for you. If you know how to read music, it's a lot easier to understand. But if you don't know how to play a violin or know nothing about posture, hand positions or techniques, this is not such a good book. Mel Bay's Violin Method is a lot better."
3,Buy the DVD too...,"Do not buy this book unless if you buy the DVD too. If you're an absolute beginner, this book will teach you NOTHING. I bought it without the DVD, but I had a grandma to teach me how to play. We just use this book as an execise and practice song book.It's got a good collection of simple songs, and a few small tips on music reading, but will get you no where without the DVD."
1,not useful,"this is pretty much just a collection of sheet music, not a beginner's guide for playing the violin.don't buy this for instruction"
1,what a joke and deceptive,"This is not a book really, it is a list of scores to play, no instruction at all unless you order the DVD which I have ordered now and we will see about that. I am very very disappointed in that I like to read material and cogitate on it. What a joke with the glowing reviews. I give it a zero star, its not a book is a music sheet. I would return this but the cost in shipping and sent would not pass an IQ test to execute on."
1,Not for absolute beginners,"I thought a book titled for ""Absolute Beginners"" would be for absolute beginners. I dont know anything about music nor musical instruments. So I thought this book would be a good introduction for me. I have been tossing around the idea of playing the violin. The book briefely explains the strings and what note is which string. Then it is just pages of music. Very few rudementry diagrams were of little help. I was hoping to at least know what to look for in a violin, how to hold is and what to do with the bow. None of that was covered. So if you are a true beginner like I am, try something different."
4,PrincessSierra,"This was an alright buy, would need a bit more to get started as a beginner, but for someone who already knows the basics it would be great!"
4,Violin Book,"The book makes the beginning steps of learning the violin amazingly easy, very easy to follow. Excellent!!!!"
5,Best for anyone,"Is the best book I've ever seen. It explain music from the very beginning, teach you how to read the Staff, and give some books about violin history you can read. I'll buy the entire collection. But as ABC of violin says ""A violin teacher is invaluable!"" having a very good teacher and following step by step this book is best method to become a pro"
4,Restart,"I played years ago so I got the book to help me to restart to refresh in playing my Violin. I wish I saw the DVD when I made my purchasing, but the book looks ok to refresh myself."
2,Something you should know...,"I've never played violin. I have a cheap one and just wanted to mess around and this book seemed like a good way to get started. There is a companion DVD that does not come with the book and unless you know something about playing the violin already, you need the DVD. They should either bundle the DVD with the book or stress that the DVD is required if you are really an ""Absolute Beginner""."
3,Good but needs to be organized,"This is a good book to learn with but it is rather confusing. The lessons are great but the way the lessons are ordered in the book makes it difficult to learn a single string. Where you are learning about using the A string; it has tidbits of the notes played on the D string as well as the E string. And the examples for the finger possitions could be easier to understand if they had been put into the book in a little more detailed way. Other than that excelent material for learning the violin. Even with the ""confusing pages"" I would recomend this book to anyone starting the violin."
2,"CD's is not organised, NOT for absolute beginner","The CD is absolutely not organized. The editors/author could have taken the time to title the songs. The song numbers DO NOT correspond to the any of the numbering in the book. You need to play each song and see what it is. Also if you are not familiar with the song, then it take some research to figure out and match the CD to the book.Also this book is NOT for absolute beginner. This is good I guess if you have an instructor of your own and the good for practice at home. I would have given one STAR to this. But since it is only $10 and includes the CD I guess with after some pain and annoyance."
3,not the absolut begginers guide,"i just received this book, for the most part i'm not disappointed, though it leaves out a very basic that most beginners don't know, how to hold the bow. the rest of it's pretty good,"
4,Continued satisfaction,Received the article in a very timely manner and in perfect condition. Have been online shopping with Amazon for a couple of years or more and have found the experience to be quite satisfactory.Have and will continue to suggest to others that they try shopping with Amazon online when the need arises for articles that are inventoried by Amazon.
4,A Good Introduction to Duras,"""10:30 on a Summer Night"" is by far the best of the four novels in this book, focusing on murder and infidelity during a vacation outside Madrid. ""Moderato Cantible"" is good but not as intriguing as ""10:30 on a Summer Night"" and is about an alcoholic mother developing an odd relationship with a stranger in a café on the way home from her son's piano lesson. ""The Square"" has some good lines but is generally slow, focusing solely on a salesman and a servant talking in the park."
5,Great book!,"I really enjoyed Dixie and her way of doing things. I thought the whole thins was very believeable, from the snow storm in South Dakato to the very end. It is the first book I have read in a long time that I wanted to skip and read the last chapter to see how it ended. I started reading and did not want to put it down. Way to go CHRIS ROGERS."
1,Explanations? There are none.,"This book may be readable, but as for any type of understanding with the case questions at the end of the chapters, forget it. I purchased this book because I had to, and I have yet to understand what they expect right away. I've had to e-mail my professor almost every time because the book doesn't explain what it's really looking for. There's no way I would even touch this book to learn about accounting if I didn't have to. My professor even admits it's not a very good text."
1,"Review - Understanding Financial Statements, 6th Ed.","The presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed, making it difficult to understand. Examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated. As someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area, I found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information. Not a good choice if you are a novice. Too bad I could not give it zero stars."
4,Enron?,"The Preface of this book reveals that the author's daughter ""completed three fascinating and challenging years as an analyst for Enron Corporation."" Indeed."
3,For Bruce Lee fans!,"I'll admit it, I'm a big fan of Bruce Lee. This book provides an interesting insight into the man and his way of life. It shows that he was human, filled with promise, highly successful and a worthy mentor. It also shows, that he learned from his mistakes, found ways to overcome the challenges in his life and constantly pursued self improvement.The only reason why I didn't give this book more stars is that I don't think it tells the reader a lot that they didn't already know. In that sense, it is a little bit derivative. However, if you are a fan (like me) or you haven't read much about Bruce Lee the man, then I definitely recommend it."
3,Nothing amazing here,"How much you get out of this book will very much depend on where you're coming from. Bearing in mind Lee's amazing physique, power and reputation I was expecting something a little more interesting. There is little in this book that somebody with a basic knowledge of weight training and martial arts couldnt tell you. If you're just getting into martial arts or working out in general and have little previous experience then this would be a useful purchase."
5,GOOD !,"This book is good. If have been waiting a long time for information like that. I don't have any professional guidance in my Martial Art trainning but this book is a great help. It's not something you will learn in a Martial Art institute. I am not a expert but with al that BS on the TV about trainning equipement and other stuff, this is the thing you are looking for. It tells how to gain strength. For all those people who don't have guidance or have, or don't really know how to do a good workout and really want to gain strength. This is your book."
2,"For fans, not for athletes!!","Although Bruce lee developped a very powerful body, and he was up to date on training methods, things have changed since is death!! Like everything, training methods evolve. Science has developped more efficient ways to work out and has set guidelines for anyone who wants to look. If you are a fan, buy this book!! If you are looking for the best way to train your body, this is not the book for you."
5,How the dragon kept his teeth sharp,"This book is a fantastic overview of Bruce Lee's method for sculpting his body into a chiseled and extremely strong force to be reckoned with. Stretching is very important as there is an entire chapter dedicated to it. There are some unconventional methods, but most are just the good old fashioned basics which yield tremendous results when properly applied for anyone. His bag work is especially interesting since he made some ridiculous combos up that are a page long in some places. His incorporation of his martial skills into his workouts definitely lend greater progress if martial mastery is your goal. That being said, anyone looking to get in better shape will benefit from utilizing the methods in this book."
5,Do you enjoy learning from experience?,"Bruce Lee is the doctor of getting into his own head and producing the results he demands... well, not anymore, but he's earned some significant title. Did you know he had his back broken and was told he'd never walk again, much less perform? With the encouragement of his wife and his mental strength, not only was he able to walk, he became the Bruce Lee we have all come to know and love. He became truly one-of-a-kind!"
4,Gift for fellow martial artist,Bought this as a gift for a fellow martial artist. Always a wonderful and inspiring resource. The gift was well received.
2,no big deal,"There are a bunch of excercices in here, ranging from weights & calisthenics, to heavy bag workouts and running. If you already train in martial arts, you might pick-up 3 or 4 good drills, or perhaps new variations on one you already do. Don't look to this book for inspiration or insight from Bruce -- there is none. It is a publication of pages and ideas from his training diaries, along with some editorial commentary. For inspiration, read the Tao of JKD, or *JKD -- commentaries on the martial way*. In my opinion, the editors of the Bruce Lee library are doing a disservice in publishing something as dry and non-engaging as *the art of expressing the H.B.* along with Bruce's books on JKD. Somewhat like publishing Herman Melville's shopping lists in a boxed set including Moby Dick and his short stories."
3,"Writing unimpressive, information good","The author plainly didn't find the right editor to help him construct a clean and coherent book of this sort. I felt it was disorganized and all jumbled together--clumsy. Nevertheless, the book contains ample information that impressed me a great deal. I'd give it 1 star for quality and 6 stars for information. Buy it, it's cool."
3,Good but too much repitition,This is a book worth owning for those who are serious into Bruce Lee's workouts. Although the book repeats itself many times (this is where cross referencing comes in)! I was disappointed that the author interviews the same people we've heard from over and over. Let's get some more perspectives on Bruce from the OTHERS that trained with him.
2,Time To Move On,"I'll be the first to say I've been facsinated by Bruce Lee, JKD, etc. for a long time. In fact, I'm a student of JKD. It's fantastic stuff, but I think partly because of the contributions from the various artists who kept it evolving into the brutally effective art it is today. But I'm also into working out in general and there's a lot better sources of Exersize Science information out there then this, even martial arts specific. Sorry folks but this is 30+ years old stuff. There's been a lot of things discovered about strength training, cardiovascular health and nutrition in the last 30 years. You'd probably be better served to read one issues of M & F. While I appreciate Bruce Lee's contributions to the MA wholeheartedly, do modern baseball players follow Babe Ruth's training regimen (OK, bad example, Babe didn't live the cleanest life, but you get my point) or does every issue of Sports Illustrated have Babe Ruth on the cover (like Inside KF with Bruce). It's just time to move on!"
2,"Interesting, but could be writen better.","The information presented about the training schedule of Bruce Lee is very complete. The problem with this book is that there is a lot of repitition. It could have about one fourth the number of pages that it is. It lacks what I was really after-Bruce's philosophies. Overall, this is not worth the money, you can easily find the information from this book on the internet somewhere."
4,Definately worth a read.,"I was under the assumption that this book would focus more on martial arts. When it arrived, I learned that it was just what it said ""expressing the human body"". This book is more helpful than I would have ever guessed. I will admit that it tends to drift from the main point at times, but I solved that by using a highlighter durring the initial read.This book is now a cornerstone to my reference collection. Bruce Lee really opens my eyes with his work-out theory. Now my exercise routine seems more efficient."
4,Lacks visuals...,"It's a good read, supposedly (note I said SUPPOSEDLY) shows his work out, diet, training, etc. However there are no pictures of him demonstrating his exercises. Instead are alot of pictures of Bruce Lee during his filming of movies or scenes from movies instead of exercises. Sure everyone knows how to use the bench press, but a visual is nice. It describes the exercises, but lacks visual representation. You'd need a workout book (I recommend Arnold Schwarzenegger's Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding to go along with this) to see exercises."
3,Good and that's all,"Good, and that's allAlthough Bruce Lee himself was masterful at his art- he was not however a God. Many people seem to consider him as so and frankly his ideas were in truth interesting and effective, but they were also not beyond the realms of any others human being's imagination. His skill was impressive but is neverthless achievable by any other human being.This combined with the pretentious writing style of bodybuilder/author John Little, makes the book a terrible read. But what it does create is an underlying message that nothing is achieved without hard work. You don't need to read a whole book to know this though."
4,Exercise got Bruce Lee half way...,"The only issue I have with this book is that it ""how Bruce got his body"" was done through exercising AND steroids. As soon as he stopped using steroids, he'd lose weight and his muscles disappeared. Once that is clear, the book is great, but the book didn't tell the reader this."
1,I`ve read better,I tried this push-up Buchanan out for one week and i did n `t lose the 300 pounds i was promised i would lose.Bruce Lee needs to stop drinking Coffee.Get it AHA.
4,A must-read book for young and old readers alike.,"This book was basically about friendship and making the right choices. I learned that if you make a choice that goes against your conscience, one must suffer the bitter consequences. In this book, two main characters were best friends, and they thought it would be that way forever. But when a new dare-devil boy came along, one of the boys went with his conscience, and the other went against it. The boy who went with his gut feelings, in a way, did the right thing, yet, in this case, he lost his only real friend to the rude boy, who had stomped in and destroyed the two boy's relationship. This book was very well-written, awesomely descriptive, and taught a very important lesson in the midst of a story packed with mystery, suspense, and an interesting, fast-paced plot. Yes, indeed, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,Fugitive Father,"Sarah Calhoun returns to Sheriff Walker's town, introducing himto ""their"" child for the first time and petitioning his helpto protect them against a killer."
1,a waste of money,i could of been more satisfied burning my money than buying this thing. i will be giving it away to the salvation army or a trashcan....
2,"Really Low Quality, but What Do You Expect?","The costume is thinner than paper and rips easily. The graphics are crappy. It's just super cheap. But what do you expect for the price? It worked decently as something I could wear underneath my thick Sith Robe other than a black T shirt, but I would never wear this as an actual costume. It ripped in two places the first time I carefully put it on."
4,Still learning -- but fun,"I wanted to make some cookies with my 3-year old that were tasty, pretty and easy, so I bought this press. I should start by saying that I do not know how to use a cookie press, nor am I very good at making cookies in general. I read all the reviews, and the only drawback to this one I could see was that it had no recipes -- so I tried it.That is only the drawback! I found a recipe online and tried out the press. Worked just fine, first try for the more simple designs (hearts, ribbons and butterflies). The amount comes out fine and the thing is easy to use.The machine itself is nice. The built-in storage container for the discs is cool, and after 3 (maybe 4 batches) of cookies, everything is still working just fine. Clean up is simple.I like it."
2,Only a few cookie disks (the small ones) work...,"I just received this cookie press last week and tried it during the weekend. The first batch was a disaster. None of dough stuck to the cookie sheet. Turned out my daughter and I had to roll the dough and use cookie cutters to make the cookies. For the second batch, I decided to use the Butter Snow Flakes recipe mentioned in the previous review. The result was a little bit different. Still the cookie shapes were terrible. I was using the flower disc, around one or two (or none) petals of the flower would stick to the cookie sheet.Finally I decided to change the disc to Squiggle. It actually worked much better. I also tried Butterflies, the result was good too. Both of them are small shapes. The lesson learned here is that the bigger shapes (most of the discs) don't work.I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,"What happened to spell check, and fact check?","It really annoys me when authors don't do their research properly. For example, in this book there is Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. BBV was the fusion of Banco Bilbao with Banco de Vizcaya... and that happened in the 80's. The name Batista, Spanish version, is always spelled with one T, not two. And the list goes on. It might be very petty, but I find that these errors detract from an otherwise well researched story, with an interesting plot, and interesting characters."
5,What the Deaf man heard review,"This movie was excellent. I got it for a Sunday School class pizza party, which included children,teens and adults. Needless to say everyone loved it! Today I still got a compliment and its been 3 weeks! Thanks Amazon for providing us with great DVD movies!"
5,Excellent!,It seemed like I no sooner ordered my product and it was delivered! Excellent service and Excellent product! Perfect in every way.
5,You'll laugh and you will be touched.,"This was a charming movie with an tremendous cast. Set in a time were this is your side of the tracks and this is our side of the tracks this is story of a young boy who obeys the last thing his mother tells him: ""I don't want to hear another sound from you but your snoring."" Suddenly finding himself abandoned in a strange town our character decides to maintain his illusionuntil he sizes up the situation.He finds this armor serves him well and eventually he becomes an un-official sounding borad for the towns people telling him their secrets thinking that they were safe. Finally a chain of events happen to which the cat gets out of the bag and there is a dramtic change of events."
1,Not a good representative of the Deaf population,"Even though the movie is touching, it doesn't represent the Deaf population. Many of them have told me that it is a good movie and wants me to watch it but they do not understand that it is not anything to do with the culture of the Deaf. If you want to understand the Deaf culture, watch the appropriate videotape such as ""Children of a Lesser God"" or ""Love is Never Silent."" I would heartily recommended this movie."
2,This shoe is not leather upper,"Hello I got these shoes becasue I really liked the way the look online and also because they say they are leather upper and well I'm very sensitive to man-made material shoes. However, when i got the shoes on the bottom you can see that it says ""ALL MAN MADE MATERIALS""I gave it 2 starts because the gems also seem that at any moment they may fall off and also they look very cheap. One other thing, if you can notice from the picture there is a cusion on the shoe, however, the stitches around the cusion seems to be too hard and I think that I may get a blizzter with them.The design of these shoes could of been better and for the price I think you may be more lucky to find something better elsewhere."
3,Pretty but not easy to walk in,"These sandals are unique looking and pretty. I noticed that sometimes I turned my ankle in them, though, because of the stacked heel. Also, the thong part sometimes felt uncomfortable because the strap around the back of the shoe held the shoe on too tight. Maybe I just got the wrong size. The sandals really added a unique sparkle to any outfit and I got used to the feel of them over time."
3,good western series,"i read all the books in this series, i love the way he always cracks the cases, and gets to sleep with all the women good and bad!"
5,Great Study Book,"I ordered several copies for a class I'm teaching. The book is one of the best for this type of study. Unfortunately, Amazon was unable to deliver the copies in a reasonable time and they came in spurts. The last two arrived when we were half way through the course. I ended up buying every used copy I could find for $1 to $2 plus $4 for shipping."
4,'Best Of' Toucans on steel pan,"A collection of the best of the group's previously unrecorded gems, from the powerful 'Maria' to the standard 'Kokomo', which comes across as a jazzy, fun classic here."
2,"Watch out, lameness ahead!",An awful guide. Who wants to work at tree farms in the middle of New Hampshire? I don't know where they get the bazaar listings they put in here. There's few places I'd want to work listed.
3,This Has to be Part of the Textbook Mafia,"There is no way I can give five stars for this book at this price. Only something purporting to be a textbook could get away with this. It is no wonder that college/university students are banding together to split the cost of books, priced as this is, buying from the internet used market, or forgoing the purchase all together.Its presentation is insulting given its already injurious price. While the content and illustrations do their jobs well, there is no color until about 80% through the book. Any number, maybe most of the illustrations could or should have been presented in color. If there is a point to be shown in a monochrome image, fine. This book was last printed in 1996. The price is today's inflated textbook price. Any book about art, with anything near this one's price should be full of color, anywhere it can be used.This is a $50 book - max."
5,Why,"Why is this currently not available? Gerry Rafferty is a brilliant songwriter and his early works with now comedian and American T.V. star are simply brilliant and essential to the collection of all who have even a passing fancy with Baker Street. Is there anyone out there that disagrees? Please put this title back in stock and I will purchase a copy and beg my friends who all love Gerry Rafferty to purchase one as they also must learn the joy and beauty of Gerry's early work.Plymmer ""Blood & Glory"" Rodrigues."
1,Easy to build but failed twice,I've built dozens of other circuit kits but for some odd reason I tried twice to get this simple little circuit running. Tried both modes on both boards and failed completely. Five stars for ease of build but half a star for function. The manuel uses very vague language. The tech support was friendly and fast but his advice failed to get this circuit up and running. Just an awefull kit experience
3,I like the songs on it....they rock!,My friends and I listened to this song (One more try) at one of my best friends' slumber parties about 8 or 9 years ago. Now we are graduating from high school and it's a big thing for us and we are so happy that this song was a part of our lives. It will bind us all together as it did when we listened to it so many years ago.
1,What's up with the stupid reviews?,"The reviews for this CD have to be the worst reviews on Amazon! I don't care about how ""thpecial"" a song is to you like some stupid caller into Delilah or something - what I want to know is, ""is this good music or not?"" And why does it suck or why does it rock. Hence the word REVIEW! I seem to recall that this stuff is disposable beats with an effeminate-sounding guy singing/whining over it. There's far better dance music, but since these reviews all seem to be ""I lub dat song"" and nothing more, I'll give my own personal take: in this town circa 1989, this was cool, just like lowering your import truck and adding lots of ""bass"" was considered cool, but really wasn't. In 1991, Nirvana arrived and destroyed this stuff. Forever. The End!"
5,Cancel My Reservation,This movie is truly one of Bob Hope's best movies. It is funny from the very start to the ending credits. The theme song is catchy with a great beat. Bob Hope and Eva Marie Saint are great together and have a comedy chemistry that can't be beat.
1,Cancel My Film Career!,"By 1972, critics, moviegoers and studio executives had tired of Bob Hope's increasingly lame comedies. ""Cancel My Reservation"" was definitely a last gasp, with Rapid Robert going through the motions in this painful adaptation of Louis L'Amour's ""The Broken Gun."" Hope already exhausted the murder-mystery angle in his earlier vehicles and the only laughs come from a series of surprise cameos. Unlike George Burns, it's a shame that Hope did not allow his comic persona to age gracefully."
1,Stupefyingly awful,"Bob Hope was funny in the late 30s and 40s, a real comic original. By the 50s he was still funny but more predictable, and his movies were not as well written (or improvised). By the sixties, he was becoming a lame parody of himself. This movie is so bad that even before the title appears, you might be asking yourself if you'll be able to make it all the way through. His later comedies with Phyllis Diller were so bad they're good, so that's something, I suppose. But this one, Skidoo, How to Commit Marriage -- awful, awful, and more awful. A terrific comic (and primary influence on Woody Allen) ended up bullying his way onto the Tonight Show periodically just long enough to plug his latest fossilized special before disappearing again. If not for his many years of show-biz service to the US Armed Forces, his number would have been up 40 years ago. So skip this one and go back to the Road pictures, The Paleface, The Big Broadcast of 1938, and remember Hope when he was truly funny."
5,Excellent Audio Version,"I listened to the audio version of this book. It was one of the most moving panoramic portrait of emotions of this war. Hearing these letters read aloud bring them to life in a way not possible in a reading. My congratulations to the publishers and producers of this work of art. Very very moving. Makes this war more of a reality for me here at home; it doesn't take sides, but expresses the good and the sad about this conflict. I laughed and misted up. A truly beautiful and broad compilation of real life stories."
1,Overrated and underserviced,"I purchased this model 1 1/2 years ago following my knee surgery. The unit worked beautifully the first 3 times I used it. When it started doing crazy things, I just unplugged the unit and when I was fully recuperated, made attempts to get the unit working. I emailed the company and they sent instructions to me as to how to re-set the unit. We went through this at least a dozen times to no avail. My unit would take off from the base and within 12 inches of the base, did a little circle dance then marched itself back to the base. iRobot tells me they have no service available for the unit and to this day, the company continuously sends me emails about purchasing a new model. I purchased the model for $150. back then and it was a total waste of my money. It has been packed away in my garage ever since. A one star rating is too high but there is no zero."
3,Great product but it was used,"The Roomba does a great job cleaning the floors. It gets into the corners, goes under the couch and bed, and even goes from wood floors on and off the rug with no problem.My only frustration is that when I received the product, it was used and had a full bin of collected dirt and hair plus hair and fuzz wrapped all around the brushes. I didn't have time to return it before Christmas so I cleaned it up as best I could."
3,Good for people with dust allergies,"Moderated with realistic expectations, this is a nice little vacuum. I can set it going in one room of the house while I do something else (work, read a book, cook, or whatever) in another room. It saves me a little time, and I avoid getting the cloud of vacuum-dust in my face - a real boon for me.I really like the fact that the Roomba consistently cleans UNDER my furniture - this makes a huge difference for people with dust mite allergies.Before running the Roomba, I do have to do some tidying - pick up any small objects on the floor, get loose cables out of the way, move any floor carpets it may catch on - which is a bit of a hassle."
3,Not what I expected,"Loved Bruford's work with King Crimson. Bought one of his instructional videos many years ago and loved that as well. But, I couldn't connect with this offering. I admire Bruford's Avante Gard spirit and boldness, but compared to the works of my other favorite drummer, Jack DeJohnette, these compositions just didn't quite hit the mark for me. I will always respect Bruford's boundary stretching determination and his skills on the trap set; I love watching and hearing him play. I look forward to all his future projects with high hopes and anticipation."
2,Disappointed,"I rarely write a review. I am quite disappointed. I wanted the history explained from a Biblical Worldview which it is. But, I kept feeling like something was amiss. There were several topics that didn't seem to be explained clearly enough. Well, if you already know the topic, then it's like an overview but if it's the first time learning the material, it is very misleading. The last straw was when I read about Hitler. The book gave my child the impression that he was just like like any other person leading a country and that Britain was in the wrong for not accepting peace terms at the beginning. Oh, and he is NOT linked to the Holocaust in this book at all! I won't say more. I would never recommend this book but if you are going to read it, I ask that you are careful when you read it."
1,Please Don't Mistake This for a History Book,I had such great expectations for this book for my daughter. After reading through it I have to say this book is an absolute joke! As a Christian and a citizen of this great country I am appalled that this would be touted as an American History book. This is an extremely biased opinion of our history. There is a big difference between Christian values and political agenda. Unfortunately this book leans entirely toward political agenda. I do not see this book as a reflection of our Christian values but merely an extreme right wing rant. I expect a history book to report history and allow the reader to build his/her own opinion. This is propaganda disguised as a `history book'.
1,"A completely whitewashed and far right wing view of American ""history""",This book should not be read by any young mind. The treatment of Native Americans and African Americans is embarrassing and appalling. A two inch thick book covers the pilgrims all the way to President Clinton. The discussion of several presidents is beyond reproach.
1,This is a Christian book,This book was not advertised as Christian but it is. There are comments about bill Clinton at the end of the book that I find repulsive.
4,Great Enclosure!,I have had this enclosure for a few months now and it has been great. I put an IDE hard drive from old computer in it to backup my current computer. It connected quickly to my computer and have had no problems with my weekly backups. It also looks great!
3,Missing chapters,"The book as such is excellent. However this version of the book had an index for 27 chapters but in the 930 odd pages, we get only 19 chapters.I bought second hand and the seller was nice enough to refund the money. As I require all the chapters, I am planning to buy the hard cover 7th edition of this book."
3,Good - but Ross awards his own kudos,"Good book overall as far as one being able to pick out info if they put their mind to it. But I thought poorly written with tons of verbiage with the most annoying part the amount of self-congratulating done by Ross.It could really be re-done in 1/4th size with as much info and without the ""I love Ross"" hype. We surely don't need to know he ate pitas with honey in Egypt."
2,"Interesting, but","This book is definately an interesting read. Dennis Ross has all of the details on all the negotiations betweem Israel and Syria, and between Israel and the Palestinians. And, it's all recounted in detail (Ross clearly took a lot of notes). However, the major problem with the book is that it doesn't give the big picture...you can get lost in all the minutia of negotiating detail. For instance, was Arafat ever really serious about making peace with Israel???? On a few occasions, Ross does mention the terrorism of the Palestinians, but refuses to put it into the larger context - on the overall intentions of the PA/PLO. Read this book for the detail, and for the detail on how Arafat refused to really negotiate at Camp David, but read other books to put it all in context."
5,read it for the language: reads like my favorite poetry!,"if you enjoy: rimbaud. verlaines(p et t). ferlinghetti. woolfe. ginsberg. reed. dylan(with a z). or smith(with a p a t t i): then you are in for a major bon-bon! A few thoughts:the subject coulda been anything and i'd love it as much. his writing's a delight: a view into a mind constantly sparking.this guy has more than 1 axe.sure, i'm a child of my times and find it easy to relate to the way mr kaye perceives the universe. so what?i won't buy my 87 yr old mum a copy, never gave her Howl either. i might be wrong.my 19 yr old daughter (who finds 'a coney island of the mind' essential) gets a copy of 'You Call It Madness : The Sensuous Song of the Croon' as soon as i can get it to her!thats all i got."
1,The author's stylistic choices degrade the book.,"Looking for an interesting read on the crooners, I was disappointed with the pretentious, erratic, and sometimes unintelligible writing style of the author. Perhaps there was interesting information buried somewhere in the half-sentences, fictional areas, and the ""stream of semiconsciousness,"" but I was too put off and bored by the writing style to slog through it past the first 40 pages."
1,Really bad,"If the author had cut the cutesy, this book would be half as long as it is. I stopped taking it seriously around page 32. But I slogged on through the remaining 400 pages just to be able to say I'd read it. Yes, there are some interesting facts and ideas but wow! what you have to go through to get them. The book might be worth a dollar or two on the remainder table, but consider too the time you'll spend reading it."
3,Definitely entertaining.,While it was not as dark as the first 'Stepford Wives' movie.. (made back in the 1970's) It was an entertaining and a cleverly done movie.
1,Didn't work for me either,"I bought the Smellkiller for a very small area containing a litter box. I have had it for several weeks and have kept water in it, but there has been no difference at all in the odor."
5,I can't believe it works. But it does!,"I'm a skeptic! I also like technology. I own a Dyson upright in addition to an in house vac. Have the latest LG frontloader washers to give you a flavor of my insane search for the latest and greatest stuff. This seems to be one of those products. I placed it by the litter box and a few hours later, nothing. I have to stick my nose inside the covered box to smell the cat waste! Yuck! I placed it by a smelly wood stove, wham-o I have to stick my nose into the stove to detect the stench. If I were Glade or Airwick I would be pooping my pants (and not smelling it!) over the competetive threat! I'd like to see others review this unbelievable device to compare the results, but so far, I'm just in disbelive... So far so good. I've read it's initial discovery was an accident, kind of like the microwave!"
3,if you are having probelms with it...,"After reading all of the reviews for this product, it seems like it either works great or not at all. Perhaps there is some factor that influences how well it functions. Perhaps it has to do with the different mineral content in different tap waters? If it doesn't work for you, perhaps your water is too pure. Maybe add a teeny tiny touch of salt? Don't know if this could work, just a thought."
3,Thin plastic,"I have previously purchased a similar product locally that was 1.3 mil thick. To my surprise, this product was only 0.6 mil thick. The packages looks almost identical so read the fine print."
5,Just Superb!,I like Gary Moore and his Blues for Greeny is one of my alt-time favorites. This set covers his work and shows what he can do. Any fan or interested guitarist will enjoy.
3,The Band didn't help!,"Not a lot of guitarists had or have the sense of timing needed to play the blues in that style very well, and since I am a blues fan it is a waste to see yet another great guitarist waste his talent on fusiony stylings. For this DVD set, the earlier ones are the better ones. 1990 and 1995 are great. 1997 is awful and in 1999 and 2001 Moore's guitar playing is great but the bass in particular is downright annoying. Way too much of the bassist, and the bass line is so annoying it makes the music difficult to listen to despite Moore's great playing, especially on the 2001, where his playing is fantastic. So I give it 3 stars, Moore is 10 stars and the band is -7 stars!"
4,"Not what I was expecting, but a great read all the same","I bought this, thinking it would be a serious and vigorous literary discussion on a thoery that I am well-read upon and interested in. That is, the theory that Christopher Marlowe wrote Shakespeare. Instead, this is a dramatic, exciting and colorful and very funny window into this time in history.I must admit, I was little non-plussed at first as this is a subject with which I treat with a great deal of reverence, but after conferring with my wife (with whom I must credit with passing on this marvellous work)I have to agree that it is about time someone brought the Bard into the 21st century. Mr Johnstone, I dips me lid!"
3,Beware of assembly problems,Assembly was a huge problem.The tool provided does not function as described. The metal poles for each corner are covered with a rubber tube. This makes the pole too large to slide the plastic cups inside the nuts at each corner. The rubber tube was probably intended to help get a secure hold when the nut is tightened. It look like the manufacturer never tested the finished product to check assembly or doesn't have sufficient quality control if these parts are out of spec.A wide blade screwdriver was needed to push the back and side panels into the snaps of the bottom. A knife was needed to angle the rubber tube at the end of each pole to remove the flare and create more of a bevel. A wooden mallet and thick pad were needed to push the poles into the bottom cups and again to push the top onto the tops of the poles.
4,Once assembled it works well,Yes. I thought it was just me. The only way I could get the panels into the slots was with a rubber mallet and I was afraid the entire time of breaking something. I really had to swing away to get the panels in there. It would be easy to hit off center and break the bottom parts. I did't have a problem with the metal rubber coated posts but I could see if they were slighly deformed it would be hard to do. But once together it is a nice outside cart.I will say that I mistakenly clicked in the wheel cap without the wheel on and had to hacksaw it back off! ( like an idiot) When I called the service number and told them I had made a mistake they were very nice and instantly sent another cap free of charge. I liked the speed and the free of charge part a lot. Excellent customer service from suncast.
5,Didn't have any problems with assembly,"I assembled the cart with no problems. However, I can see how there might be problems if any of the tubes become slightly crimped on the ends. I guess it's luck of the draw. All issues of assembly aside, this is a great cart. I use it as a potting bench and it has a great deal of storage and bench top recesses for my shears, fertilizers, and other random stuff. Great price too, compared to the more expensive potting bench by suncast. I like how it rolls too, I leave mine in my garage in front of my water shut-off valve so it's nice to be able to roll it out of the way with ease."
3,Suncoast Garden Cart review,"This is the 2nd Suncoast Garden Cart I have purchased. No other company makes this type of product that I can leave outdoors in my rose garden, hold all of my supplies, and have a counter top on which to work. It is also eye pleasing and durable and affordable. The last one lasted 5 years and was replaced because a can of pruning spray exploded inside of the cart from the heat, making it unusable.Problems=1-The wheels are a real pain. They fall off as soon as you try to roll the cart (it is better as a stationery cart)no matter how well you install them2-The front feet,not on wheels,bend with any weight on them.3-If it came in a color that blended better in the landscape that would be a plus3-I can only find this product on-line. It would be great if Home Depot, Walmart, Lowes or Target carried it locally.Susan Schrank"
4,nice and roomy,This cart has sturdy construction and good room inside it. I like the fact you can wheel it around too. Because it was my first amazom purchase I even got a discount!!
3,not great,the movie showed up very scratched but playable. The movie was rather bad but its heart was in the right place
5,The Irish That Could Not Swim,"Thats the description most Americans use to describe the Welsh. With authors like Peter Gill, John Helmer and Kristina LLoyd the average American is opening its eyes to the reality of Britain, its people and what life is really like. Theres no bowler hats nor umbrellas in these witty thought provoking works of the finest young talent from a far away land. Join me and travel in your arm chair. I dare you."
4,SOME GREAT SONGS!!!,"BURN, Coverdale's debut on Purple is a good rock piece with the classic title track, MIGHT JUST TAKE YOUR LIFE, SAIL AWAY and MISTREATED...i really prefer IAN GILLAN as Purple's voice, but BURN got many great moments!!!"
5,Self Descriptive Title,"Features some of their best playing. The vocals of Cloverdale and Hughes work beautifully together and put anything Ian Gillan ever did to shame. The songs are strong - not a single dud here amongst them. The arrangements sound tighter and the tunes have great riffs and solos without getting lost in the haze. Very economical sounding - no endless doodling here as each riff, solo and vocal exchange seems to have a distinct purpose. This is definitely a classic, must have hard rock album that no hr fan should be without."
4,Let Roger Glover have a go....,The recordings are nice and fresh compared to the original CD releases. Another incremental improvement. Shame there wasn't the huge jump in quality that was found on the Roger Glover remix of Machine Head. The beautiful three dimensional soundscape found on that remix should become a benchmark.It's still worth replacing your old BURN though as the first release CD was pretty muddy sounding. This is a clear improvement..... I just wish they'd let Mr Glover have a go at it. (I know he didn't play on this album..... but his machine head remixes are a revelation)
2,Jitters and blackouts,"No problems with the item in terms of connections and structure, however, when I tested it directly from my PS3 to TV I got jitters and blackouts galore. Here and there the cord would work fine, but 5 minutes later it was back on the fritz. SOOOO glad I didn't put this in my ceiling to feed my projector without testing. I am returning the item and purchasing another."
1,DO NOT BUY!,THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! The product shipped is a 26AWG Wire not 22AWG. Please DO NOT waste your money. The cable shipped is available for half the price.
3,Ends aren't very tight.,"Cable is good and thick, plug is not as tight as a brand name plug, and if I wiggle it in my Amp/Reciever the signal cuts in and out.. (brand new amp, and I tried a different, more $$$ cable and it didn't wiggle at all) but good value for the money. Since My amp is against the back of a cabinet the cable can't wiggle and it works fine."
2,cheap price cheap quality,"First of all it's a cheap price for a 35 ft HDMI cable and of course cheap quality. It is said 22AWG HDMI cable, yes it is very thick but unfortunately most of it is plastic. It does the job. no problem about working but don't buy it just because it is 22AWG. You can buy same quality with cheaper price."
5,Techno-Pop: Who'd say they got it right?,"Techno-pop. Does it ring a bell to you? Erasure? Pet Shop Boys? Back in 1997 when most Mexican music seemed to be stalled, these guys come out and break every standard set by the national music industry with one magnificent piece of an album. Morbo's soothing voice along with nicely planned 'beats and bytes' made this one album a must for every mexican music appreciator. I'd honestly say this is Moenia's ONE and ONLY album, not to imply that recent albums are bad, but this one has that special something that will keep you hooked for hours onto their tunes and still want to pop in this disc into your player countless times. Definitely, a must."
4,Arriba!,"I checked these guys out after reading some of the reviews. Moenia is definitely a cool band. They throw down some great synth fused dance music. Production is top notch, as are the mix and beats. The vocals are choice here and the lyrics too. All the songs are decent. Even if you don't speak Spanish, the groove will move! Also look for OBK, another similar act>>>Esto es un gran CD. Si usted tiene gusto de música de la danza, escuche definitivamente esto. La mezcla y los golpes son fantásticos al igual que los vocals, las armonías, y las líricas. También busque OBK, otro grupo similar. Que Dios te bendiga!"
4,"Very good album, but Moenia is no Depeche Mode","I got this album after hearing Moenia's extraordinary rendition of José José's ""Volcán"". If you haven't heard it, I highly recommend you do so (even if the original José José song is not to your liking). Although the songs in this album don't measure up to their work on ""Volcán"", it is a very good album. ""No puedo estar sin tí"", ""Déjame entrar"" and ""Estabas ahí"" are excellent songs."
5,No Puede Haber Otro Grupo Mejor Q' MOENIA,En toda la musica Latina no habia surgido ningun concepto como el de Moenia!! Todas sus canciones son Excelentes!! Ha llegado un Nuevo Gropo de Techno PoP Lationo!! QUE ES LO MAXIMO!! Y tengo el orgullo de Decir Q' No son extranjeros!! Son Mexicanos!! Gracias Por la buena musica!!CHAOSITO!! KARLA YADIRA
5,One of the best techno/Depeche Mode sounds today.,Great CD if you're into Spanish techno. The music is similar to Depeche Mode.. mellow with awesome beats. I highly recommend it.
4,New trip!,"I am going to assume you are at least familiar with Merzbow and I wont go into my usual explanations. This album is part of a new direction for him more along the line of sampling drums and guitar using electronics as a secondary back up to his sampled repetative rythm. Mixing samples with pure sonic noise he also had the CD ""Doors Open At 8 am"" which is the same style as this. This is his period just before straight lap top which isn't as interesting as this. A little easier on the nerves but still Merzbow! One of his better releases."
2,Has great parts and horrible parts,"Before getting this book I read the notebook that Microsoft hands out at their training class. That notebook was great but covered only 2/3 of the material. This book includes what is in that notebook and it also includes coverage of the missing 1/3 not in the notebook. That 1/3 is a joke. I am disgusted with the pathetic attempt at the remaining 1/3. Given this, this kit is over priced. Get the book by David Besch instead. It is much more focused."
3,Good but not enough for 70-029,"I purchased this book with the 70-029 exam in mind. Dislike other reviewers I didn't have any experience in Microsoft SQL Server, I was migrating from the AI/X DB2 world. This book is superficial in important aspects like index tunning and distributed queries. I finally had to adopt a different strategy based on sample tests and Microsoft Books On Line to pass the 70-029 with a less than satisfactory 755 mark."
4,Pretty good Book to prepare for the exam,I found that this book gave me a pretty good understanding of what to learn for the exam but I found that I still had to find other sources to fill in the gaps in this book. Overall the flow of the book was good and explanations pretty up front.
5,As close as you're going to get for full 70-29 coverage,"I would consider this an essential if you're attempting to pass 70-29. Having vaguely only heard of SQL Server prior to 3 weeks ago, I was able to fall short of passing on my first attempt by 1 question, using this training material alone."
3,Too Long,"be warned: i have written dozens of exams in my day including a few MCSE's and 70-029 is by far the toughest of the MCSE's i've done so far, and one of the hardest of any i can remember.the training kit is mediocre. too many useless examples that underscore simple points.conversely the exam dealt quite a bit with SHOWPLAN TEXT which is barely covered in the training kit. i would generally not recommend this product EXCEPT it has the huge plus of including a free eval copy of SQL server. it worked right away whereas the one you can download off their web site, well i never could get that to work for some reason.back to the exam, look out for DBCC SHOWCONTIG and lots of arcane design questions ... one with 8 different tables described in over 2 full screens of text followed by questions like 'this design allows for no redundant data, T or F'?"
2,Not worth the price,"Overall, this kit is not a good value for the money. The strong suit of the book is the information it contains on indexing and the DBCC SHOWCONTIG statement in particular. But this information could be easily gotten from SQL Server Books Online. Throughout, the editing is poor with lots of typos and formatting errors. Plus the exercises and sample batch files and scripts will not execute properly if your SQL Server configuration differs even slightly from the book (like you don't install to the C drive).A much better book is Inside SQL Server 7.0 by Delaney and Soukup. In that book the writing is many times better, it's well edited, and it also comes with the same 120 day evaluation version of SQL Server 7.0. There isn't the same degree of hand-holding, but if you have any experience with SQL Server you'll appreciate the thourough and professional treatment of the topic, and you'll learn at least as much to apply towards the test."
3,Good basic information - not sufficient for the test,I took the Microsoft Course and purchased the book and the new book by Lance Mortensen. I nearly passed. The problem is that the material required for the test is in many cases not covered in the books. The new Transender exam is available in beta form.
1,When will Microsoft get it???,"I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) and have used both the 3 ringed binder materials as well as the self-study materials. Both are blessed by Microsoft, and as the description states, are identical; they in fact are.With that said I've taught 832 and 833 classes and I can state that in no way will the instructor led nor the self-study course prepare you for the exams. Why you ask? Well I took t he Beta Exams for both parts of the SQL Server exams and I can tell you that the Microsoft courses fail greatly at preparing you for the exam.Suggest you wait for Transcender to come out with their practice exams and study them well, in particular the explainations given for the correct and incorrect answeres. Buy only the books, etc they used as references. You will be miles ahead and money saved.Regards,Steve Grigsby, MCSE, MCT, MCP+I and soon MCDBA"
5,I'd like give it one more star if it's possible!,"That's the best SQL Admin book I've ever seen. I have no idea about SQL server and zero database experience just 20 days ago. With this book and transcender, I passed Microsoft SQL 7.0 Admin exam (70-28) with 800, and I do fell I've understood some SQL admin now. I hope all the Microsoft books and be as good as this one. Thanks for the good job!"
2,Useless for exam 70-029,I've read it almost three times and didn't found it to be very helpfull for certification exam 70-029.
4,Holds all of my camcorder accesories,Very good and has enough room to hold all of my camcorder (sony hc48) accessories. No need to carry any other pouch seperately for accessories. Good looking for the money you pay for. Will recommend to others.
4,"Well, I don't really know","The book was pretty good, and the end with Beau and all had a really big impact on me, but I had a hard time picturing it, the whole setting seemed un real, but thats just me."
3,Flash Fire,I Think This Book Deserves a Three and a half. It was kindaboring. I Did a report on it and got stuck with it. But I Did KindaLike It. I like all of her other work better. i was a little fan of hers. Thanks Bye!
4,This Book Is Great!,This book was boring at the start but got better and better the more I read. I liked this book because I like action and a bit of sadness. I also liked this book because it showed different people's perspectives. It taught me how to escape fires and what to take with you when your house is on fire. This book is one book you can't put down. You will love this book from part of the beginning to the end. This book will teach you many ways to survive a fire. You've got to try out this book.
3,It is a good book,"I read the book the Flash Fire and it is a very good book because it has really neat things about it. There are two things I love about this book, one is when the brush fire started out as a small fire and it got bigger and someone that was a fire fighter saved many lives that day. There were some people that died that day and they died because they were in their house and the house fell to the ground and burned. The next best part was the grass canyon road were a car had an accident, and the ropes saved many lives. I recommend you to read this book someday because someday and someone might save your life."
3,A 3-star book,"I thought that this book was boring to begin with but as I got more into the book it started to get more intersting. I thought there were too many characters like many of the reviewers said and that at some points it was hard to follow. All though in this book unlike some other books they did a good job on telling you the setting and the time of where this chapter is taking place. I also agreed with another reviewer on the fact that since there were too many charaters, there would be a chapter about him and then you wouldnt here anything from them until another 5-6 chapters. I have never read any Caroline B. Cooney books before but from what other people have said this isnt as good as some of her earlier ones. My personal opinion though it wasnt that bad of a book but if you are going to read it you have to have patience, it starts out slow."
3,OKAY,"This book started out being really boring but it got better as it went on. I liked the way that it was divided up to tell the time, place, and different people's perspectives on the situation.. That made it easier to follow. There wasn't enough descriptions to make it seem real. Things happened to quickly to seem real like how they got out to safety. I also liked it because it contained adventure and a little sadness. It did tell too much about the people's personal life but overall, it was an okay book."
3,Flash Fire,"This book is like being in a room of obnoxious people. You want to pick them up and slap them. It's a good book, but the characters are all very aggravating. Are people really that selfish and inconsiderate? I'd hate to meet one. From whiny to stupid, if you want an annoying person to hate, you'll find it. The book isn't like ""OMG I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN!"", but it makes you want to keep reading."
4,A Fiery Book,"I honestly believe that this is a very good book, aimed mostly at teens though. Although I did like the book a lot, I wouldn't recommend it as a book meant to be ""time consuming,"" as I finished it in a half an hour. There are some good points and bad points of this story. I didn't like the fact that there were, like 20 different characters. After a while, I got used to it, but it was hard to figure out at first. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that the storyline was sometimes confusing and I had to read over again. I feel that ""Flash Fire"" wasn't the best book by Ms. Cooney . That said, I like the book a lot. Some of the good points of the book were the thrilling, edge-of-your-seat plot, the nonstop adventure, and the thoroughly realistic storyline. I feel that ""Flash Fire"" is the perfect book for someone looking for adventure who has a tight schedule."
5,Steering Wheel Cover,"I love this steering wheel cover, I used the same model in my old '98 Honda Civic. Recently got a new car and couldn't find it in any stores, so I resorted to an online source!If you have trouble turning your car(ie your hands slip when you turn or it rubs the wrong way) this cover will definitely help add some grip. Another perk is in the summer time when it heats up the car, this material does not get as hot as the steering wheel alone.I received the package a lot sooner than I had anticipated, very happy with my order!"
3,It's OK,Was too big for my steering wheel so I'm not sure if I stretched it (if that's possible) so my boyfriend is using it on his car and has had no complaints thus far.
3,too big,I was excited to purchase this for my sports sedan. The look was on point and construction is solid. Sad part was that it was too big for my TSX.... I gave it away to my friend. It fit her mini vans steering wheel very nicely.
3,Fits Xterra just fine.,"Bought this for a Nissan Xterra and the fit is perfect. I put it on by starting in one area, and slowly working it around as stated in another review. The chemical smell of the cover others have mentioned was annoying for some time. It took about four months for it to subside.Update 12/27/12: From 4 to 3 stars. Some of the stitching is now coming apart where I hold the Steering wheel. The quality could be better on this item, as it's only been on my car for 8 months."
4,Nice for the Price,"I've had the other ""3-raised-nubbed"" type for years and liked it, but this one is a pleasant change. Rather than having my hands at 10 and 2 all the time, like the nubbed type tells you to do, I can now indulge those wild moments of rebellion and go to 11 and 3, or even 9:45 and 3:25 without the guilt. [And after a turn when the wheel whips back to straight it feels neat against your hand.] The only drawback - takes a long time for the smell to go away - but as with most plastic these days you know that goin' in."
5,Funny,"I have to say I laughed out loud at some of the early commercials on this set.Yes, the production values were ""interesting"" back when television was starting out - but the results are so funny it doesn't matter.I bought this DVD on a lark just to see what it was all about and could not believe how silly television advertising was in primative times.The ads are better than some movies I've seen lately."
1,You'll see red,"This was a terrible vampire film. Two girls are out in a field at night talking about someone undead they've killed and they're attacked by a vampire woman in retribution for what they've done. One of the two runs off but the other is kicked and scratched, and becomes a vampire!!!They then go off after the other woman who hides out in a femal sorority house, which just happens to be no where near a university, nor does it have a phone - none have mobiles, so when they're attacked by the vampire one woman leans out the window calling to a neighbour ""Call the police, we're being attacked by vampires!""One woman gets bitten on the arm, she breaks free, holding a pointed stick, and saying she'll kill the vampire if she tries that again!Totally woeful. This is one that could have at least had a titalating factor - but none of the chicks gets down below underwear or a towel."
5,DELICIOUS TORTILLA CHILLI,"The soup reminded me of chili soI added pinto beans to the soup& ate it with cornbread.Delicious, Nutritious & Easy!An instant family hit!NOTE: I strive to incorporate items on handinto recipes, especially when buying in bulk.It also makes a shorter grocery list!Natural Value Organic Beans, Pinto, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"
2,"Sweet, bland, and terrible","I don't taste any Mexican/Latin spices in this soup at all, nor do I taste any tortilla. It's very sweet, bland, and flavorless. The vegetable stock has any hardly any flavor, either. Doesn't taste like any tortilla soup I've had in a restaurant. So sweet that it tasted like it had fruit in it, and no spice or salt whatsoever. Blech."
2,1960mg of Salt per can-- ALL WERE CRUSHED BY AMAZON,"Well, the soup is very salty, way too salty. Sadly, all 12 cans I received from Amazon were so badly dented from having too much weight stacked on them until the cans crushed. This was clearly visable, yet Amazon shipped them like this anyway. There was no damage to the box they were shipped in.Just a waste of time for mediocre soup. So far the other soup from them, had half the cans dented as well. Not a good sign."
4,A must for all Big Country Collectors,"""One more time for the Clown & the Wolfman"" - who can forget those words from the Restless Natives Movie.This CD sums up the haunting, atmospheric tunes of that movie and the bonus tracks are an absolute must for any collector."
3,"DOESNT GLITTER IN PLOT, BUT A SPIRITED, UNFETTERED DEBUT","I picked this up as a chance trial at an airport book stand, knowing nothing about the author. Discovered that this is a debut, and it's quite an impressive one! The story is grounded in the Canadian construction industry, which may at first make you expect very few thrills 'n chills, but McAdam's prose is brash, ribald and bursts with energy. Even a relatively wry plot about a family's misfortunes and disintegration thereof is lent some readibaility by a clever denouement that weaves in the conflicting ambitions of two very different men. Quite a worthy read, but I would also consider buying a used copy."
4,"Slow start but a good, thought provoking book","I was intrigued by the first chapter of this book so I bought it. I almost regretted my decision in the next hundred pages, but as I kept reading I was pulled into the characters and their troubles. The last half of the book is outstanding and I recommend this book because of the last two hundred pages. I suppose it takes the reader that long to adjust to the change of voice and character. None of the characters, save Jerry the younger, are terribly sympathetic. In fact, I found most of them, particularly Simon, to be unlikeable. Nonetheless, McAddams brings these people to life and sets them in motion. I enjoyed seeing them collide. I am still contemplating what the ""some great thing"" is for each of these characters."
2,Short Walk,"The picture of ""Tracks Sherlock Travel Staff"" informs me that issomething like a ski pole but it really is not. The instructionsfor operation or use of the features of the ""Staff"" are not to be found. A tag attached tells me it can be used in many ways but nothow to do them: Like shorting, lengthing or dismantling etc.I don't think the rubber tip is going to last very far on rocky trails.It's as good as many I have checked out and better than some.To compare an orchestra conductor's baton to a baseball bat is tocmpare Sherlock's Staff to my image of a genuine Trekking Pole."
2,disappointing,"length adjustment mechanism is awkward, certainly not intuitive.Have to return it for defective camera mount screw."
3,I was let down,"While it is still better than much of what is available, I felt let down compared to the other six discs that RCR has done before it. But do go to see them live if you ever have the chance."
5,Great RCR EP!,"A great EP of new songs from the RCR. Eddie hits the vocals, and the music is top notch. Great to hear the guys still putting out awesome tracks after all these years."
4,Fun & Good workout,"Fun lessons. Though I did find some moves are hard for ppl didn't really dance before.But if you keep practicing, you will get it. Like I can manage body roll now, which is unbelievable"
2,The DVD doesn't offer a good work out.,"I don't feel like working out at all. The moves are boring. The set looks cheap. However, it's good if you wanna learn some moves for a night club."
2,should have read reviews first,"Not what I expected. Did learn a few moves, not as detailed as I thought it would be, and not good as an exercise use either."
3,Fun but Long,The video is pretty long and the moves are somewhat involved. I did this a couple of times but havent touched it since I bought it almost a year ago.
5,Perfect Combo!,I love this series and I'm so glad I bought both DVDs. They complement each other so well and they're different enough that both videos are definitely worth it on their own. They are both very unique and I've never seen anything like them. I suppose they fall somewhere in between Carmen Electra's series and Exotic dancing. They're both sexy and seductive yet they never become trashy or questionable. And the instruction is terrific. Worth it for sure!
3,"Not as good as ""Sexy Moves for the Club""","Most of the moves on this DVD aren't sexy. But then again, this is just my subjective opinion. I would only use in the club 1 or 2 moves from this DVD, while ""Sexy Moves for the Club"" has much more to offer."
5,Buy This Lace Knitting Book First,"I highly recommend this book as either a first lace knitting book or to add to a collection because it is both helpful and beautiful. I have purchased other lace knitting books but because of their complexity I had never used them to produce a piece of lace. The author of this book, Mary Shiffmann, taught lace knitting and includes in the book a list of projects designed to help novice lace knitters develop their skills. I was able to pick up this book and without other help teach myself to knit lace. Also helpful is that all the patterns are charted. The book is an interesting mix of the author's personal history, discussions about lace, and lessons. It also contains an excellent variety of patterns (from easy to complex), projects and suggestions. I plan on working my way through many of the patterns.The book has an artful approach that shows the beauty of hand knitted lace."
2,Very few projects,"The cover is deceptive in that it shows several lace doilies, but what you see on the cover is what you get in the book. Most of the stitch patterns are found in most pattern books. The only part of the book that is truly unique for the experienced lace knitter is the few lace edging patterns. Not worth 17.95 for those few patterns."
3,The Lacy Knitting of Mary Schiffmann,"The book is nice but the item i saw when i was looking at it on-line was not in this book, it was a lace knit christening gown and the one in the book is only a lace knit edge"
5,Great little side companion to milk-eyed mender,"If you love Joanna's unique sound and lyrics like those heard on her last full-length ""The Milk-Eyed Mender"" then you'd probably appreciate this two track disc which contains a more heartfelt and less 'studio' version of 'Sprout and the Bean' as well as an unreleased track 'What We Have Known' which I think is a great track and likely ranked amongst her best works."
3,Too greasy to wear under makeup,I love EltaMD products but found that the Sport version was too greasy to wear under makeup. I prefer a lighter formula whether I'm wearing makeup or going barefaced. This product would be good for beach goers.
4,Great product for sensitive skin,"My daughter had scar resurfacing surgery last spring and we were advised to use this product while she was outside. She loved it. It provided great protection to the delicate skin regrowing underneath the skin as the scar was healing. I wasn't too fond of the tint, it was a bit dark for her lighter skin tone. She didn't mind it though. This product definitely products excellent protection and is worth the cost."
5,Solid Product,One of my staples. Goes on smooth. It feels light. Great to wear under makeup. Great to wear alone. Have already recommended thiis product to several people.
4,Great sun protection for outdoor activities,"I bought this sunscreen after seeing it in the bag of one of my tennis buddies. He explained that he bought on the advice of his dermatologist. So far, so good. No burns after two hours of outdoor play."
5,Mouse Review,"I purchased this because I had one that I liked and wanted another. It has all the features I was looking for: full size (my big paws don't do well with the tiny notebook mice), an on/off switch on the bottom to preserve battery life, and bluetooth connection directly to my laptop without a separate dongle to plug in. It works equally well for right or left handed people."
2,obiwan,"There are better choices. It is not ergonomic, and can fatigue wrist. I have a mouse pad in the design of an oriental carpet. The laser has a very difficult time ""reading"" it. Therefore, the cursor frequently lags the mouse, and is very slow to catch up. It does not have that problem on the top of my desk, only on the pad. Also, the cursor does not respond real quickly to small mouse movements. I must make large mouse movements for the cursor to respond. The battery does seem to last as advertised. The time between recharges is pretty close to what is stated. The ""back"" button is too small and not well placed, and I use that button a lot. I'm already looking for another mouse to replace it."
3,Good and Bad,"The Good.Excellent feel. That is, it fits my large hand perfectly. As well as any LogiTech mouse.The charger stand is much easier to use than my previous LogiTech as you just lay the mouse on top of the pad.The bad.I keep losing the Bluetooth connection whenever I wake up my Mac. I think Microsoft really designed this mouse to work with their silly USB-Bluetooth adapter. But, what is the point of using Bluetooth via a USB port?"
4,Great features Bluetooth dificult setup w/Dell Latitude Notebook,"Great features with the Microsoft mouse. Wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier. Comes with a USB dongle that I did not want to use so I was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in Bluetooth in my new Dell Latitude notebook. Found that the Toshiba drivers provided by Dell for the Bluetooth would not work with the Microsoft mouse. Seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of Bluetooth devices. Go figure.... Had to delete the Toshiba drivers and let XP with SP-2 provide the drivers and it works great.Pros: Great features, no cord, long battery life between charges (days), very responsive.Cons: Some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle, bigger than I like to pack around for a notebook."
1,BEWARE!!,"I don't want to sound negative; this is no way a slam on Amazon.I purchased this mouse and loaded it onto my system, Microsoft immediatelyPopped up stating I needed an update for the bluetooth receiver. Ever since the updateMy computer freezes up when it goes into screensaver mode. Long story short,Make sure your operating system is not Windows XP media center when you purchase this mouse, there is NOT a fix yet for the bluetooth receiver!1 star is for the crappy responce from Microsoft."
1,Wreless Mouse,"When I first read the Microsoft Mouse Laser 8000 it read new a a very good price of around $40 dollars, good deal for for an $80 plus dollar being ""NEW"". It took well 10 days to receive my merchandice form the location in California and I live In California. Once I received my merchandice it was not ""NEW"" but factory referbushed. I will never do business with company a again and Amazon.com shoud look into this for miss leading the public."
4,Great Mouse,This is a great mouse. Easy to install and connect. Responsive and great battery life.The only complaint that I have is you are limited to a fixed range of reassignents for the buttons. I have not been able to get the mouse to accept button reassignments for games.
2,Not for me,"As reported by many others, the side buttons are hard to reach and the scroller button is nearly impossible to use. So if you are buying for these features, I wold look for something else.The big problem that made me return it was that sometimes it would not wake my PC from sleep mode (I had to use the keyboard as a wakeup call). When this would happen, the mouse would be dead until I restarted the PC.This was true even after I updated the software to version 6.2 (the latest on Microsoft's site).At least Amazon makes returns easy."
2,Not solid built. Could be better for this price.,"It is a good mouse and the installation is not hard. this mouse looks good and feels nice in hand. I use left hand mouse so there are not much choices for me. I will give it a better star if it is built with a better quality.The problem I have is: the left click of the mouse (which is the primary key since I use left hand) feels diffrent from the right click. The left button is hard to pressed down compared to the right button, and there is a squick of plastic rub against plastic when I click the button.I thought this may only happened to me since I did not see anybody else complained about it.But for a mouse at this price I really expect something build more solid and better quality."
1,"Fine, but check and double-check","The mouse feels good, tracks well and is not bad for office work, including lengthy stretches.If your idea of a good time with an expensive piece of hardware is to try and cure the infamous 'battery case ailment', however, steer clear. I've used several of the ridiculous fixes to be found all over the net, and eventually they all boil down to a fail.Even if using tape, folded Post-Its, thirteen renditions of setting/resetting Bluetooth and leaving the power switch either on or off in the cradle can see you through, is that what you want out of a mouse with this price point?Nor me.Contact your vendor or Microsoft representative and make very certain indeed that MS has fixed the matter before buying.Posts and blogs about the flaw date anywhere from the release date till 2011.For me, it's on a shelf to be used in emergencies - with an ordinary alkaline AA battery."
3,"If it stops recharging, try replacing the battery","Another reviewer noted that after a few months of use, the mouse will not recharge anymore. The same thing happened to me and replacing the battery with a new rechargeable AA battery fixed the problem."
1,Defective Charging,"This product has a faulty battery connection, which means that it doesn't charge properly in the cradle (green charging light changes to flashing red within seconds). There are numerous forums on other sites discussing how this is a faulty design that should have been caught by MSFT quality control, and suggesting ""fixes"" with tape, paper clips, etc. I had been able to jiggle the battery around to get a successful charge at times, but now even that doesn't work. Complete waste of money for a defective product."
2,kinda sucky for work involving fine movements,"I've had this mouse for a while now and it's always had charging problems- mostly when I run it down to where the red light starts to blink then I put it on the charger and it starts out ok, but after a few seconds it goes to the rapid-red blinking of ""charging error"". Which is annoying, but if you pick it up and drop it on the cradle a few times eventually it gets the idea.But lately I've been needing to do a lot of fine mousing, and what I'm finding is that it is constantly going to sleep and missing my fine movements. If you're moving the mouse in big happy gestures it works great, but if you're moving slowly to get pixel to pixel accuracy it just stops responding.So beware, if your work or play involves fine mouse movement the standard optical mice (like the intellimouse) are much better."
3,not for a Mac,"The software on a Mac cannot program the two small buttons on the side. [And it is not sold for a Mac, but neither are a lot of other products that work quite well on a Mac.] Unlike a LogiTech mouse, this one cannot hide a program with a one button click. Otherwise a very well designed product, especially the charger. Neat."
2,Middle mouse button worthless!,"I have a laptop with Bluetooth built-in and I wanted a full-size Bluetooth mouse to use with it.Many of the applications I use rely heavily on the middle mouse button. Unfortunately, the middle button on this mouse does not respond properly, making for a very frustrating experience.Also, the clickless wheel sounds like a good idea, but I enjoy a little tactile feedback from the wheel.Why can't Microsoft simply take their nice, basic mouse, and make a Bluetooth version of it without trying to add a bunch of new ""features"" to try and justify the high price?"
2,Lack of accuracy,Completely disappointed with the performance of this mouse. The pointer latency is so bad I often have problems clicking where I want. The construction is nice and solid and I like the features. As another reviewer put it the thing acts lazy and is kind of heavy as well.I can only guess it is Bluetooth as I have another cheaper Microsoft optical mouse that is of the nonbluetooth varity and costs about 1/2 the price of this one and out performs it hands down.
2,"Functionally fine, ergonomically a bad fit for me","I've had about every Microsoft Mouse that exists. I found that this one just did not fit my hand properly. It's been the first Microsoft or Logitech mouse that I can say I didn't like how it felt. I didn't get much further into using it or getting an impression about the other features because it was such a bad fit for me I ended up sending it back.There are lots of very positive reviews here for it, so it must be right for some people. I just wasn't one of them."
1,Do not buy for a Mac!,"With the Microsoft website clearly mentioning MacOS X functionality, I purchased this mouse for my iMac - fully intending to use the built-in Bluetooth for keyboard and mouse (no wires, free up a USB port).This mouse will not pair with the built-in Mac bluetooth (MacOS X 10.4.8). Even when you use it with the supplied Microsoft dongle (if I wanted a dongle, I would have bought an RF wireless mouse!), the supplied Microsoft drivers don't ""see"" the mouse and you cannot set the functionality for the additional buttons or left-right scroll capabilities."
4,Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 - Tempermental,"This peripheral has the advantage of coming with a rechargeable battery and charging station. It solves the frustration of having to run for batteries at just the time you can't leave your keyboard. However, it seems that at times the buttons are too sensitive, and at other times you can press them three or four times before they take hold.I need a remote type of mouse and this fits the bill. I record and edit music and space is a problem. With this mouse I can be at my music source, which is stationary, and a considerable distance from my computer,and yet activate the ""record"" or ""pause"" function of my computer program. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it."
1,Not a good mouse,"Other than the goodies in the product page, I am going to talk about what I don't like only. This is the worst mice I have even used! Coming from the great history of mouse making, I am surprised that the latest one from Microsoft is exactly the worst one in my opinion.1. The right thumb button or whatever you want to call it does not make any sense, since users have to move the whole hand in order to press that little right thumb button instead of the design in previous version like Intellimosue Explorer.2. Don't know if this one was design universally for both right-handed and left handed people. If you have been using the right-handed or left handed mouse, this is definitely not the right one for you.3. ""4-Way Scrolling"" is just a plain bad design. There are so many functionalities built-in to this little wheel or button. For those whose work in CAD every day, this is definitely not a good design. It is way harder to do press and drag than Microsoft's previous mice."
2,"Interesting, but flawed","A chronicle of the 1967 season where the 76ers finally dethroned the mighty Celtics. Lynch is very passionate about the 76ers (a decided plus), but frequently resorts to tired cliches in his writing and this detracts from the story. He must have used the word 'whines' about eight times in writing about post-game comments. Still, this was an interesting read. As far as his contention that the '67 76ers are the greatest team of all time...the post-season success of the 1960's era Celtics speaks more eloquently than I can."
5,Completely satisfied,The book was well packaged and arrived as advertised. The arrival was within the time suggested at purchase. It was a job well done.
4,Consise history of three monotheistic religions,One of the best books I read in this subject. In three volumes you get the origins of the three religions with comparisons and particular beliefs. very valuable comments on scriptures. Book has considerable amount of references and original quotations. I really enjoy the way Mr. Peters writes. I found his book on Life of Mohammed also very nice and informative. These three volumes are also same quality.
4,3-4 books,"Note: Under the same title ""Judaism, Christianity, and Islam"" there are 4 different books: (1st paperback)Vol. 1 ""From Covenant to Community"" (ISBN#0691020442); (2nd paperback) Vol.2 ""The Word and the Law and the People of God"" (ISBN#069102054x; yes x); (3rd paperback)Vol.3 ""The Works of the Spirit"" (ISBN#0691020558); and the earlier large hardback containing all 3 vols (ASIN#0691073562). As all covers look similar in the small display photos, you should order by the # in ""advanced search"" mode."
5,Too awesome!,"OK, the moment I saw this comic, I knew it had to be mine, but I was completly surprised by how awesome it really was! So much better than what I thought it was going to be!To start off with, the characters stay true to their personality, and the story follows that of the video game. Think of it as a what happened behind the scenes take on events.Not only that, but the fight scenes are absolutly wonderful!And the comic is in COLOR! Whoa! Super high glossy graphic novel quality, like you'd expect from DC or Marvel. The art work is just gorgous too!Completly beautiful!The script is believable (Ash gets called a French Poodle in vol. 2, ^ ^; ) and the story flows very nicely. Again, the skill in making this manga was top notch. Very nice. Pictures are beautiful!All in all, I'm hooked. Well worth the money and an absolute must if you like anything KoF. Get it!"
3,built it but didn't work well,It would take a lot of fine tuning and a really clean power supply to get it working. I did enjoy putting it together and learning all of the components but it really is not functional for day to day use as a tv transmitter. Beside everything is digital tv now and the analog signal that this trasmit is low quality and may not be supported by very many tv's now.
5,The best,I think this is an awesome movie especially because i was in it. I was the civil war reenactor that flinched. It is a great movie and i highly recommend it.
5,Wonderful: If you are a sucker for romance,"And I am. But the description above explaining the mix of scifi/fantasy with a love story is on the mark, I think it has rarely worked this well. It doesn't hurt that the actors are fabulous!!"
2,Where to find The Love Letter,"In answer to Lynn Gaige:The Love Letter"" (August 1, 1959) by Jack Finney-Published in The Saturday Evening Post magazine in the January/February 1988 issue-Collected in I Love Galesburg in the Springtime (1963) by Jack Finney-Collected in Tales Out of Time (1979) edited by Barbara Ireson-Collected in Tales in Time (1997) edited by Peter Crowther, ISBN number 1565049896-Collected in The Young Oxford Book of Timewarp Stories (2000) edited by Dennis Pepper"
5,The Love Letter,"I ""stumbled"" on to this movie on evening while in lost in the deepest grief I have ever known, due to the loss of my beloved...It was such a comfort..and made me hope again..."
4,NO SPECIAL FEATURES,"The Love Letter is one of my favorite movies. The DVD is definitely worth buying if you like time travel romance.However, be warned: there are no extras like interviews or a ""making of"" feature. Every DVD I've seen so far has special features so I was surprised and extremely disappointed to find nothing but the movie on this DVD. If you want to see additional features, buy the Hallmark ""Gold Crown Edition"" VHS tape."
4,i love it,"When I just go through this movie from the national movie channel, I rocket to the internet without any breakfast to search any tips about this movie. I have no idea what impulse me to do all of these, maybe power of love, similar feeling of the four dimension, or a belief of a kind of time machine can travel through the reality and fantasy. I am reading H.G. Wells¡s ¡Time Machine¡(1870)and did some related investigation about his novels and inner spirits. When I happen to turn my focus to this, subconsciously, I realize that I start to pin my hope on his impossible imagination from this moment.."
2,"Interesting, but odd","I'd give this more like a 2 1/2, but I rounded it down. It's kind of interesting, but it's really not the best. The ""touching"" through time stuff is extrememly weird... and the ending is odd, too. I thought it was going to be some kind of dream or something, but it tried to make the ending happy, but instead made it weird."
2,Unbelievably hokey and cheezy!,"Usually, i love Hallmark movies, but this one was very disappointing. I bought this video because of reviews I read on this site. The story line is so incredibly unrealistic and hokey that i could not even focus on the acting. I'm all for love and romance stories, but this one crossed the line. It was so predictably lame. The only entertaining thing about it was making fun of it with my friends as we watched. I feel very sad to have to give this kind of review for a Hallmark movie, but i would hate for anyone else to waste their time and money as i did. If you are in the least bit a realistic person, do not get this movie!"
5,The Love Letter,"The Love Letter is a story that is intrigueing and entertaining It carries several messages but may be interpreted by the viewer. I have seen it numerious times and given it as a gift twice. This purchase was for me personally. I enjoy a story tat leaves one with a warm feeling, I know its fantasy but it is amazing what the human heart will accept for wholesome and committed relationship. ""perhaps we can't help who we Love""Jerry Housley"
3,The Love Letter DVD,I hadn't seen this movie for many years and wanted to see it again. It was okay as movies go but it's not something I'll be watching over and over.
5,ONE OF THE BEST ROMANTIC STORIES EVER!!!!!!,From the first time I saw this movie I was in love with it. The story weaves from past to present so fluently you can almost imagine that Scott and Elizabeth's lives are running simultaneously. It is definately a four tissue movie. This is a must see for all who believe in true love and destiny. Enjoy!!!!
5,The Love Letter,"I purchased this for my friend who had owned the VHS version of this movie previously. She loves this movie and her husband even enjoyed it although he originally thought it was going to be some ""sappy chick flick."" For those interested in history or romance, this is a good movie to own."
3,A good read but don't expect to build a rifle after reading it.,"This book is a very interesting read and there is no doubt that Bill Holmes knows what he is doing when it comes to building a rifle. However, the drawings are not accurate and there is simply to much information left out of the plans for an individual that has never built a rifle before to read this book and build a bolt action rifle. The information that I found most useful in this book is the information about materials selection, heat treating, and the machining processes used to build a one off rifle."
1,Guide? Guide to where?,"This book is filled with generalities and unspecific instructions. If you want to build a rifle this book will do little more than frustrate you. The sketches leave a lot to be desired. there are missing dimensions, missing lines, missing hidden lines, missing drawings. Bill you are no engineer or draftsman, if you are going to publish a book don't be so cheap and hire someone that can take photos and draw (preferably with a CADD program, maybe even a drafting board.)If you know nothing this book maybe helpful."
2,To grumpy for middle age men.,"This was a gift for my husband, an avid hunter and gun enthusiast. He read a bit and handed it back over and said, ""Nah"", the guy is to grumpy."
2,"Dated, more suited for hunting rifle gunsmiths","I am getting into Benchrest Shooting and gunsmithing match quality rifles. I was hoping that this book would give me some good info and teach me some new techniques. Unfortunately the book is pretty dated and is more suited to hunting rifles and actions. The illustrations are sometimes blurry and all are in black & white. There is some good information but there are a lot better books out there in my opinion. For benchrest precision, I just got a book from John Hinnant titled ""Complete illustrated guide to precision rifle barrel fitting"", it is a lot better. YMMV"
3,Single-again vs never married,"The viewpoint of the author is more from the ""single-again"" perspective as opposed to the 'single-never married"" view. She does touch on the never-married topic but not significantly. If you are in the first category, this book could be helpful, but having never been married I did not find it as appealing."
2,A little disappointing,"This isn't a kick a** book like I was hoping. It isn't a celebration of the single state; it seems more the the author was regretfully resigned to this delightful condition. Some of the adivce runs like ""bla bla until you can find a man"" or ""it's not your fault you are single, you've tried long and hard to find a man"". As if we were waiting with baited breath for prince charming. I guess it's okay for the needy types."
3,Nice BUT....,"I love the color and the quality seems nice on this yoga mat.My only issue with it is that it tends to get slippery upon sweating. My MAIN reason for purchasing a yoga mat was because the mat I was using (just an old used exercise mat but thick!), was due to a tendon injury from slipping during a pose. I researched these TO DEATH before I finally decided on this one based on the good reviews and the price.If anyone claims that this mat doesn't get slippery when sweating they're not sweating!Perhaps over time it will somehow get...""worked in""...and the slippery factor isn't HORRIBLE but it's a factor I was so trying to remedy in this purchase....It IS soft, and colorful and seems sturdy although I found it to gather up at times during transitions from poses like downward dog into upward dog....and the like.It's not a BAD mat but I was expecting something more tactile and less smooth."
5,An awesome sticky mat!,"I have been practicing yoga for quite awhile, and I have tried many different mats. I figured this would just be a prettier version of your basic sticky mat, but I am happy to say that it is noticeably softer and more cushioned-feeling than other sticky mats with the same measurements.My mat stays in place for my routine and doesn't leave an angry waffle-pattern on my legs after sitting in lotus position for a while. Like all sticky mats, it has a bit of a chemical scent when first opened. This airs out over time, and is actually nowhere near the smell of other mats I have had.I noticed another reviewer was complaining about a lack of stickiness, and to that I suggest following the directions for washing your mat, as a dirty floor is probably to blame. I was pleased to find the free yoga class certificate, and I look forward to signing up! This is an excellent sticky mat at a good price, and it's pretty, too!"
3,Cute but uber slippery,"When I got the mat I was so pleased on how cute it was! But when I finally put it to use, I was less than impressed. It is slippery and doesn't have great stability, but if it were to be used in light yoga or a more introductory level class it would suffice. I kept the mat, because I took too long to try it out, and I will be giving it to my nephew to use."
2,A disappointing yoga mat...,"I was super stoked to receive my beautiful tie-dye sunset hugger mugger yoga mat but when I opened the box it was shipped in my excitement was crushed! The mat had obviously been dropped in its packaging, it had dirt on several places and the one end of the mat was ripped. I would have simply returned it for another but the 'tie-dye'that was advertised was not tie-dye at all. The mat was mostly red and just looked a bit faded. I returned this product and was highly disappointed that my experience ate up my time and energy and still left me mat-less!"
2,Great for a first mat,"I bought this mat to go through my upcoming yoga teacher training with me. This mat looks just like the mat I had fallen in love with at my yoga studio so I thought it would work the same for me. It's just as sticky as they advertise but the mat is also very slippery. In downward facing dog my hands start slipping toward my feet. I'd suggest that a beginner interested in relaxation and mainly seated poses buy this mat. If you are planning to use a mat for yoga class or a daily practice, buy something else. MyGaiam Yoga Mat (Koi Fish)had acceptable traction and lasted me for a good amount of time."
4,Yoga Mat,"This is my first yoga mat and I am very happy with my purchase. It sorta smells when you first take it out of the package, but after a few uses it disappears. Plus, it is very pretty to look at. :)"
3,Not as attractive as the photo,"It's a nice mat. Smells fine. Works well. I wouldn't have paid quite so much for it though, if I had known it wouldn't look as nice as the picture. It's attractive, just not as beautiful, vibrant and stripey.There are a couple stripes at one end.Sort of a disappointment.I'm considering a return and purchasing a less expensive mat."
4,Reading To Exercise Your Mind!,"ULysses, by James Joyce is a classic to say the least, however, it is a difficult read. The language is somewhat dated and it requires some past knowledge of epics such as Homer's The Odyssey to truly understand what is going on. It is often frustrating to read but is a gratifying experience when you understand the depth of the things Joyce is explaining. Each chapter is written in a different medium to explain one day in the life of this one working man.It is very helpful to know someone who has previously read the book to discuss concepts or confusions."
4,one of the better books on Waterloo,This is one of the better books on waterloo. Good graphics and detailed maps. Fair and balanced view.
3,Second look,"While this book is still very interesting to own and is far from being a piece of ""garbage""(see above praises), after reading different writings about the battle of Waterloo, different analysis, I am not confident anymore about the exactitude of its content. In spite of all the chrome, there is simply better material out there that goes deeper into the analysis and avoids the pitfalls of secondary data.This mix of good material with data that can be challenged certainly shakes the confidence I had in the book. While it is a good book, its usefulness in my library will be limited.I would recommend to read in parallel ""The Battle: A New History of Waterloo"" by Barbero (The Battle: A New History of Waterloo) which offers a slightly different perspective and challenges through careful analysis of first hand accounts and data some of the more common knowledge.History is a very elusive field, not easy to address. The Waterloo companion lost a bit its way."
4,A massive book,"A large pictorial book not suitable for reading but for skimming thru on the Waterloo facts. Quite well-presented, it has its fair share of editorial typos. I like the well-presented maps."
1,does not include handheld microphone,"This item does not include the handheld microphone as pictured. J&R invoice says ""not responsible for pictorial errors."" Beware!"
3,Nary a spark of light.,"I generally like the tough, gritty, can-handle-anything character, particularly a female. But Stella is so unrelentingly dark as to be oppressive. Thankfully, she is in therapy, which offers the only hope of my continuing the series because I read first for character. The book is well written but, without a single spark of light, I did not enjoy this book as much as I might have done."
1,Vile and depressing,"This book is not badly written. But the content is so depressing and the incidents so vile that it makes for a miserable read. There is no relief, no oppotunirty to recover from one grim episode before lurching into the next.It is the school of gritty realism. Psychopaths rule London's Underworld. The dysfunctional ""hero"" - D.S. Stella Mooney, is not sympathetic. Nobody is. This collection of characters are enough to make a person lose their faith in human nature.I do not like giving up on a book but finally lost my patience just over half way through. The incident between Steve Tanner and DS Mooney in the pub finished me off. It offended me beyond my endurance. The final straw. And the book went in the trash.I wish I had not bought this book. I hated it. And I don't recommend it."
3,excellence and mediocrity,"Some of these songs are pure excellence! Young's arrangement and performance of traditional tunes is fantastic- good for a big fun family dance party. The original songs are eneven: Plow to the End of the Row is really good, but Home Remedy is sappy and gets old fast. A couple of political songs are well written and performed, but annoying in their suprficial treatment of complicated issues (or maybe I just disagree with her!). I bought this after hearing Leather Breaches on the radio and thought I would get a great old-time music album. What I got was a good folk album with some strong old time influence. If that's what you're after and you agree with her politics (she is admirably spunky) you will love this. If your looking for good old-time music you'll get about three excellent songs here and some filler."
4,does the job,easy to put together..did it myself..no tools needed!! pretty sturdy...it is narrow but u can store some tools and garden stuff..it seems waterproof so far..save the box for the shelf cutout..i didnt realize it until i was folding it up for the garbage. pleased with my purchase.
4,Nice Unit,"I finally decided to get a small storage unit for our rakes, shovels, hoes and other assorted garden instruments that had been leaning against the side of the house for a long, long time.This one looked nice in the photos and with the exception of some warping on the side panels, it looks pretty good in person, too!It was relatively easy to snap together with the exception of the door hinges. I had to really wiggle them up and down to get them in, but other than that, it was a ""snap""!It holds a lot more than I thought it would. I also ordered some of the hooks that go with it to hang some items inside as well."
5,love it,this worked out great for my space. The directions were clear and It was so easy to put together. great product
4,Needs at least 1 or 2 shelves included,"This is a solid body storage building exactly as advertised. My goal was to store a mower, trimmer, blower, gas and miscellaneous items. I had to build a shelf (not included) notch it to fit and install it before putting roof in place. It works great for gas and miscellaneous items leaving room for taller items but they must be tilted some. If you have a mower with retractable handles (which I do not) it will fit in this building. (So mower is still out) Other than that it has cleared up the mess in the back and locks the flammables up too.Be careful to read instructions because it would be very difficult to take pieces apart after clicked into place.If you are planning to store a mower I would recomend a larger unit just for ease of use. This one is great for a lot of gardening supplies but I think they should provide at least 2 or more shelves."
5,Good little shed,The item arrived about three weeks after it was ordered.One of the pieces was damaged in shipment.I called the customer support line.A replacement part was shipped out to me at no charge.The broken piece was to be discarded.Constuction was easy and quick. ( 1 hour )
1,poor quality,"we had a wind/rain storm a few months after I'd bought this shed.It blew over, fell forward and the top piece split in two.We threw it out.I've since purchased 3 rubbermaid sheds mainly because our rubbermaidcomposter had withstood many years of use. big mistake to buy anythingSuncast, they're very flimsy."
5,Suncast Vertical Tool Shed,"The Suncast Tool Shed is a small plastic shed that can be kept on a deck or other small area. It is well constructed, very sturdy and waterproof. It's an excellent product that I would highly recommend."
2,Very Difficult to Assemble,"Many of my pieces arrived significant warps. It took my wife and I over 4 hours to assemble. We needed to use our putty knife collection to wedge the warped pieces together (one of us on each side of the each piece). If we had bought this at a store, it would have gone back.The design is ok and the final product works well but Suncast needs to improve their quality or inspection for warped parts."
4,The Right Storage,"This unit fit perfect into the location desired. It has enough room to hold all outdoor equipment, yet the size makes it a practical product."
1,slow shipping,"I ordered this product on 3/26/07, received a shipping date and then a revised shipping date and then another shipping date. It is currently scheduled to arrive between 4/23 and 4/30. The item was not backordered so I fail to understand why it is taking so long to get it shipped. I will admit that I complained to Amazon and received a nice letter of apology and an adjustment to my order. But that has not expedited the shipping."
1,Shipping cost,"I was going to purchase this item until I saw that the shipping was over $80.00, which is almost what the item costs. This is exorbitant and thus I did not purchase it. I am disabled and shopping is difficult, so I rely on many home deliveries when I can. Rating of this product would be much better sans shipping costs."
5,Excellent Book,"I am a doctorate student and had read this book to write one of my exams. The book brings in one volume the history of Orientalism, anti-Orientalism, and the creation and development of area-studies programs in US. It presents the main theoretical assumptions, their critiques, and their change. It also discusses the main authors who shaped the field with their works and ideas. Besides, it situates these academic developments in their right socio-political contexts. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Middle Eastern studies."
2,A scholarly work,"This book is as good as advertised. It talks about Western views of the Islamic world. And it is thorough. It does spend quite a while discussing the views of Ed Said. And it even mentions many of Said's critics and quotes them fairly.Unfortunately, when Said writes nonsense, the author basically lets it pass, taking him to task only for some of his more extreme language. When others criticize some of Said's brayings, the critics are often condemned in no uncertain terms. Given how awful Said was, I find this inexcusably dishonest.Nevertheless, I liked the book so much that I'm actually giving it two stars! Some of the criticisms of the Zionists are very thoughtful. It is true that we don't always predict the future accurately. And it is true that consistent failures of the antizionists to predict the future would not in itself prove that antizionism is somehow Wrong. In addition, there are plenty of facts in this book. It isn't completely worthless!"
2,Won't keep out grackles,"It's important to know that while this may keep out squirrels, it WON'T keep out those ""thug"" birds.I hung this feeder out today, because my local bird store told me it would keep out larger birds. Well, the grackles just love it. They've been hanging on it all day. Their long beaks easily reach through the cage to get the seed, and they've been jealously guarding it as their personal food source all morning. Sorry songbirds!"
2,Too hard to take apart,"I bought this for my parents for Christmas. It was important for them to be able to take the cage off the tube feeder and clean the feeder. They couldn't see how to take the cage off. They called Droll Yankees and were told there is no easy way to disassemble, that you have to bend some wire to remove the cage. The product was returned."
2,VOICE RECORDER,tHIS VOICE RECORDER HAS SMALL BUTTONS AND IS VERY HARD TO ACTIVATE. ALSO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT TO KNOW WERE THE CONTROLLS ARE. cAN'T USE IT WHEN DRIVING. OK PRICE BUT HARD TO USE.
5,how can south park be bad?,"there is no bad episode, in my opinion, and so of course this is going to be worth buying. i mean, cow days and chef aide, two of the best episodes. cow days depices a festival in south park in which they celebrate their beloved cows, its a spoof of the running of the bulls. it is very funny, wit everything from the line ride to the cow cult. next we see chef aide,in which chef is sued for two million dollars. while chef is selling himself the boys go door to door of celebrities houses selling chocolate bars to raise money, when they realize how many people chef knows, so they all come together to have a concert to help chef. its hilarious, everything from them making fun of alanis morrisette to the ""chewbacca defense"" this video is a must buy for all south park fans buy, laugh, enjoy bye"
4,"Pretty funny, but not all the episodes are ""Chef"" episodes","On this DVD there is ""Chef Aid"" where Chef owes a record company a lot of money and all these rock stars have a big concert to raise money for him.There is ""Behind Chef Aid"", I didn't watch it, but its not an episode.There is ""Succubus"" where Chef is getting married, but the woman he is marrying is a demon sent from hell to suck the life out of him. This is my favorite episode on the disc.Then there is ""Rain Forest Shmain Forest"" this has nothing to do with Chef, he doesn't even appear at any moment in the episode. The kids go join the ""Getting Gay With Kids"" choir and try to save the rain forest.There is also the music video for the over-rated ""Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls"" song."
1,Hated this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book was SO confusing and it never got good. I just kept reading it waiting for it to get better and it never did. Whatever anyone tells you PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. It tells a horrible story about a girl named Baby Girl and how horrible her dad and life is. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Peroid.
5,I COULDN'T STOP READING THIS BOOK!!!!!,"THIS BOOK HAS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF BABY GIRL, WHO HAS A LOT OF TROUBLE AT HOME: HER FATHER! HE TRIES TO MURDER HER! BABY GIRL AND HER MOTHER HAVE TO MOVE AWAY, AND THE NEW TOWN ISN'T FRIENDLY, IN FACT THEY HATE HER. THE WAY BABY GIRL MAKES FRIENDS AND EVEN A BOYFRIEND IS HOW I WOULD DO IT. WITH A ROCK BAND! IN THE END, I COULDN'T BELEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER!"
5,STRANGE & WONDERFUL,Baby Girl and the town of Cot will stay with you forever. I've never read anything like this. It's fantastique.
4,"So far, so good","Just got this yesterday to go with my Panasonic blah blah 50"" 60U plasma tv. So far works great, no problems except the remote. When I am trying to navigate the menus on a DVD and press an arrow button to move around the menu, the ""cursor"" goes nuts, bounces around all over the place to where I can't select which audio option, or watch special features, etc. This was solved by programming my tv remote to handle the DVD player.Someone else said that when using HDMI you can't get audio out of the coax cable, and thinks the same is true with the optical output. Not true, I use an optical outpout from the dvd player to my DTS receiver with no problems. Which, not to go off topic, but WHY do most new dvd players, even some HDMI models, not have an optical audio output!?! You can't get DTS out of digital coax. What is the thinking behind this!?!"
3,Not bad but missing some features...,"Well, first let me say I do not have this hooked up via HDMI yet. I ordered the cord off E-Bay rather than paid the jacked up price Circuit City was asking for one.....So, I cannot comment on picture quality. I am using S-Video, so of course it does not look any different than my last...However, I am a little disappointed with having fewer features on this one than my 6-year old Toshiba. I cannot seem to find out how to use the remote to display how much time is remaining in the movie or the chapter. This might seem minor and probably is but sometimes if I am watching a movie and need to get up I will wait until a chapter is over. The remote buttons seem to be a little delayed, have to hit it a couple times to get it to register."
3,You get what you paid for.,I really wish this dvd player would support upconverted movies via component. If you don't have a tv with an hdmi input then you might as well buy a regular pergressive scan dvd player. or at least buy an upconverting dvd player that garantees it can play via component cables.
1,freezes,"this dvd player freezes every 15 to 20 minutes on three different dvds, freezing for about 3 seconds. I'm using a Monster HDMI cable to my samsung 40 in. LCD tv. I know it's the dvd player because the timer on the dvd player also stops when the screen is frozen. This is pretty much unacceptable to me for an upconversion player. A digital break up precedes the freeze. Also, when fast forwarding, the player will also freeze after a few seconds. This would be so very embarrasing to have spent so much money on my new samsung LCD tv, player and cable only to have the digital picture break up and freeze in front of friends. Again, I know it is the player because the dvd's timer freezes and it has happened on three different dvds. I will get a Sony and hopefully this will solve the problems. I'm having visitors from out of town next week and I don't want to feel like a fool with sub par dvd performance."
1,Beware - this DVD player does NOT play DivX files!,"Contrary to what the product descriptions on samsung.com, amazon.com, bestbuy.com, etc. say, this DVD player does NOT play DivX files. I purchased this player almost solely based on the fact that it would play these files, but when I got home, it would not play them at all. I ended up calling 1-800-SAMSUNG and a CSR told me that the DVD-HD860 does not play DivX files, but that the DVD-HD960 does (and oddly enough, the product description for the DVD-HD960 does not mention this feature). Boo to Samsung for their incorrect product descriptions!"
1,SAMSUNG DVD PLAYERS = JUNK!,"I bought this DVD player because of the HD Up-Conversion feature. BIG MISTAKE! I should have looked into this product a little more before buying.This thing was terrible, EVERY DVD I played in this thing would skip (two of which were brand new, fresh out of the factory wrapping). I can't tell you how frustrating it is to have all the best electronic equipment and hook-ups available in order to get a near high definition image on my HDTV and have a disc STALL for three to four seconds EVERY TIME I WATCH A DVD.I RETURNED this cheap piece of junk and bought the Sony DVP-NS75H instead.STAY AWAY FORM THIS PRODUCT...IT IS LOW GRADE, ELECTRONIC, GARBAGE!"
1,No DivX - Samsung's info incorrect,I bought this product recently and befor doing it I search for specs on samsung's website. Once I receive it I realize that the main reason I bought it did not worked (DivX playback). Also every image I saw on the net of the 860 had the DivX logo on the player but mine didn't. Bugging blue light when the player is on that almost makes difficult to watch movies in dark rooms.
2,Returned without opening the box,Returned to Amazon without opening the box because I ended up purchasing a SONY home theatre system that included an upconverting DVD player as part of the package. I will say I was concerned about the number of negative reports I read concerning the Samsung HD860 DVD player after I had ordered it in comparison to the SONY equivalent DVD player.
2,Problem Reading Some DVDs,"I have had the same problem others have mentioned in their reviews. On occasion with certain dvds the movie will begin to pixelate, freeze, skip, etc. It seems to be related to overheating because if I shut the unit off for a few minutes and turn it back on it will play fine again for 20-30 minutes, then start screwing up again. I even tried giving it more aiir circulation but it didnt seem to help. I am returning it the store and exchanging it for a Sony DVP-NS75H. I did give it two stars because when it was working the picture was outstanding even using the S-video output."
1,freezes and is prone to heat,"I bought this with a samsung tv TX-S3082WH HDTV (unhappy with it too, underscan and convergance problems) But anyway this unit would freeze and lock up on pristine new dvds. performance was even worse on backed up dvds (dvd-r dvd+r) manual says it's not compatable with burned dvds even though the unit has the logos and advertisement tag saying it does, I returned the unit for service and 3 weeks later got it back, they replaced the pickup assembly and it's operation is better but not great, still freezes on burned dvds (I am a service tech my self and allready know they will give me problems not honoring a warrenty if it's just burned discs it skips on)It does now work with all my normal discs a bit better but still does skip! It's going back to service,It is sensitive to heat, do not place this unit on a stereo or tv, picture quality is great and will still output an optical info while using the HDMI cable,"
1,Horrible.,"Worked fine for two months. Now, it shuts off ALL THE TIME, for no reason. Constant need to reset the thing. Junk."
5,Love this upconverting DVD player,"This little DVD player has everything I was looking for. Mainly, the upconverting functionality and optical audio output. Great bang for the buck value also."
1,"Unfortunately, this Player was VERY buggy for me, too","Hello all.Unfortunately, I've had three of these players and it freezes for about 2-3 seconds just like the review above. Mine also, at one point, stopped responding to remote control button clicks and the player itself didn't respond (not even the power button) I had to unplug it from the wall to get it to respond.This player comes highly recommended from every store I've been to (only 3), but I'm giving up on it. I'm buying either a Sony or Toshiba.Sorry I can't say this was a stellar product, b/c I'm usually very satisfied with Samsung products.Good luck and happy shopping!"
4,"Great player, not many extras.","The remote is simple, and light in weight. For the price, this little unit shows a top quality pic. You won't go wrong to but this one."
4,"BUENO, pero no increible","Es un buen mix de musica electronica, pero espere que me enganche mas. Es para tenerlo pero el precio es un poco alto."
5,hard to find cd,this is an extremely hard to find cd in the usa but they shipped promptly and with no problems. it was brand new and arrived timely.
2,Not a lot of substance...,"I have a lot of workout DVDs, and bought this one because Valerie has inspired me. However, I am not a fan of this product. The DVD is two workouts, one 20-minute beginner and one 30-minute bikini workout. First of all, I do not like the trainer in this video. He is not very relatable and just seems a bit odd to me. Second, this video is mostly lower body work - I would say well over half is lunges and squats. Lastly, while I love Valerie and find her completely relatable and sweet, the cueing is not great. She and the trainer go different directions and aren't completely on the same page. This is one workout DVD I wish I hadn't purchased!"
2,Swindled and Misled - Disappointed!,"I am disappointed. My case says that this has two workouts. The first one being 20 minutes and the second being approx. 40 minutes with cardio ""bursts."" Much to my dismay when I played this DVD for the first time the second workout was only approx. 30 minutes with no cardio ""bursts."" That was specifically why I bought the video. It seems with some research there are two versions of this and I was an unlucky person who had one version of the DVD and a different version of the packaging. Did Gaiam not think that people would notice this? The version of this video that I have is really for beginners or maybe on light days. I absolutely love Val and I know this isn't her fault but I'm really upset that I bought this and wasted my money. She is way too good for this company mistake."
1,Not good,I am sorry but I do not like this dvd. Valerie complains way too much. I mean I like that she is honest and that working out sometimes isnt the most fun thing to do but she is constantly making moaning sounds and acting like she isn't enjoying it. To me that is not motivating. I used it twice and now am trying to sell the dvd.. I won't use it anymore.
2,Losing it and keeping fit!,"Let me first say that I love Valerie Bertinelli, and when I saw she had a workout DVD coming out, I was EXTREMELY EXCITED... Now having wasted my money I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! If you have knee problems this isn't the work out for you, at one point Valerie comments on all the lunges,the trainer tells her cockily ""I like legs"". If you have knee problems,are busty,have a bit of a belly or any type of breathing problems you will pretty much sit this one out DUE TO all the lying on your stomach. As a busty asthematic I found myself more annoyed then enjoying this DVD."
3,Better than I thought,"I bought this video at a discounted price, figuring that it would be an okay workout for the money. I was surprised that it included some pretty good toning exercises on the 40 minutes session. The cardio type exercises were mountain climbers and a jump twist move - neither of which are my favorites. I liked Bertinelli's comments - although some reviewers didn't. Her trainer, Christopher, is kind of intense but she makes the video more fun."
3,Losing it review,workout is ok but I have seen a lot better. I think the talking in between the exercises when Valerie acts like it is to hard and keeps on saying Christopher makes is sound kind of cheap.
2,Exercise DVD's,"I don't like the fact that you cannot pause dvd. Starts from the beginning each time. if you want to do the 2nd workout, you have to go through the first one before you can do that."
3,Great for a Beginner,I got the video last night and thought that it is great for a beginner and someone wanting to new to strength training. This didn't provide much of a challenge for me.
3,Not overly challenging,"To be perfectly honest, I find it hard to believe that Valerie Bertinelli lost a lot of weight doing this workout. It isn't bad, but I would recommend doing it on a ""lighter workout"" day (maybe on a day that falls in between your more challenging workouts). It's enjoyable and easy to follow - just don't expect to feel like you've really exerted yourself when it's over."
2,It's just 'ok',"I bought the video after seeing Valerie Bertinelli talking about it on the Rachel Ray show this summer. They made it sound very exciting and effective. I like parts of it, but my biggest problem is that it's almost entirely focused on squats and lunges. Don't get me wrong - I understand that squats and lunges are effective exercises. However, this makes me reflect on the video negatively for two reasons: 1) I already do plenty of squats and lunges already. I don't need $9.00 DVD to tell me that they're important, and 2) After finishing the DVD, I didn't feel that the rest of my body got nearly the workout that my legs did. This DVD would probably be helpful if you just need to be reminded to do squats and lunges, but overall was lacking in originality and comprehensiveness."
1,Valerie Bertinelli: Losing It and Keeping Fit Workout,I purchased this thinking it was a 20 and 40 minute workout only to find out the first one is a 20 ninute workout the second is ONLY 30 if that....HORRIBLEPlus too much talking and joking on VB part makes this an OKAY workout
5,classic prank call record,"I have been looking for this for years. If you've seen the famous video with Ellen Degeneres talking to ""Gladys"", you know these guys. This is a full album of similar material, plus a fake phone psychic and more. As hilarious as the Jerky Boys but much smarter."
3,Good kit-costly shipping.,"It is a good kit. It does the job. However, it does not come with a mic. Getting the right mike and its components signifies another mini project, more time, and a bit of more money. The shipping charges are stunning.cj"
1,useless,"This is a truly useless book. Not even any good as toilet paper (too coarse- no, I didn't try).It contains nothing of value as far I can tell. It won't tell you how to configure Samba for file and print sharing with windows. It mainly just prattles on with a bunch of crap about some 'fictional' company that is the purpose for confuring windows and linux to coexist.Seriously, this book stinks. Perhaps it's just too philosophical for me? But then I like my books to have a function and purpose and get down to brass tacks with the concrete, useable knowledge. Not drivel.Give this book a VERY wide berth and save your cash."
1,What a disapointment,This was in the horror section it there were no horror stories in it. Disappointment for days. The stories were just boring slice of life hooie. Yuk
3,not really for me,An interesting concept but I was turned off by most of the stories before I gave up altogether. Just not for me.
4,Stories of the strange and unusual,"Tim Lieder's anthology is an entertaining trip into the Outer Limits of the Twilight Zone. It is a place where a War Against Clowns is violently waged, a magician is taught magic by a scottish crab, a pretty lycanthrope unleashes her wild side in a London club, and a not so imaginary friend helps a shy young man get the girl. Sadly there are no cannibal teddy bears to be found in any of the stories. Maybe in the next anthology. Recommended."
4,Lovely to look at,Not much text but that was well made up for with beautiful pictures. The rooms are really beautiful and except for a few weird ones (fabulous but not achievable for the average person) the rest of the styles were achievable and mostly unique.
2,Not too inspirational,"Looking for modern nursery ideas, this book was not inspirational. It has some good theme room ideas and storage ideas, but nothing that you could use to decorate a nursery that wouldn't need to be redone in a few years as the child outgrows the room."
1,I fell for the other reviews,"Save your money - don't bother with this one. It's pure tripe from beginning to end. Awful, just awful. Couldn't listen to a whole cut all the way through."
5,What a knife!,This is a super-super sharp boning knife that I use on just about everything except chopping. You will appretiate the stiff and wide nature of this knife as well as the price. I love the handle also.
4,Nature poetry,"One of our foremost poets, Gary Snyder is a real 'mountain poet' in that Japanese sense. He actually spent about 9 years in a zen monastory in Japan. This book was his first major work, and put him on the map. For those who love poetry, especially Ecology inspired works, it doesnt get any better than Snyder, and this work is one of his best early efforts."
3,Samba and Brazilian Popular,"This is a really good band, although this album is not one of their best. Songs like 1,2 and 14 have a lot of energy and make the album be worth, but overall it could be better."
3,Strings have come out of EVERY bag!!!!,"I do like these bags, however every single time I go to take out the trash...the same thing happens. THE STRINGS pull out, not on both sides but on one side then to close the bag I have to come up with a new way to tie it together....Its very VERY annoying!!!!"
5,This tugs your heart strings!!,"This book was wonderful!! It made you laugh and cry, which is the scale I judge books on. The stories were written in different styles, making it so personal. And it makes you want to head down to the nearest animal shelter to see how you can help. Congratulations to the author. I wait for her next compilation."
3,"Heart warming, feel good, animal rescue stories...","I haven't read all of this book, but rather the stories that interested me. Several brought tears, usually happy, to the eyes. There is a wide variation of the expertise of the writers, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the read, and shows you don't have to be a professional writer to write a good story. I would recommend this book to those that have an interest in saving unwanted and abused animals, and perhaps encourage more people to seek out adopting these ""loosers"". Most make our lives much fuller. Heart warming, feel good stories."
2,Beware!,"This is a book of tabs & notes, NOT CHORDS !! Just an FYI if you're looking for a Christmas book with guitar chords, look elsewhere!"
3,"A fine, light-hearted read","I bought this book because I like the premise that scientistscan fall in love, too <g>. While the hero and heroine were,indeed, bona-fide lab-coat-wearing scientist-types, don't read this book expecting to learn something new about artificial intelligence or robotics--or even plastics, for that matter. Our intrepid couple are as reality-based as the absent-minded professor. That aside, the story was cute, with the misconceptions (of otherwise very clever people) ripped away in a satisfying manner. The only thing I found a bit icky was a character being massaged and otherwise 'serviced' by a robot. Granted, this was only mentioned in passing (sorry, no interesting salacious details) but I still felt some moral twinges. If it's a robot, is it sexual harassment? Is it fair to create artificial life for use as a toy? Do androids dream of electric sheep?"
3,Midnight Kisses,"I have this book in paperback and ebook. I like this story. Its definitely an early work by this author, but she doesn't disappoint"
2,Disappointed,"Having read other books by this author, I was sure I would not be disappointed - sadly I was. I could not relate at all to the characters or to the plot, and although I stuck with it until the end, was left with the feeling that I had missed something."
2,Disappointing,The description of this book was misleading. I was disappointed. I liked the concept but the book in itself was 'wordy'. I'm sorry but I did not care for this book.
4,Good...for its time,"This book provides a great overview of what we know (or what we knew) about primate cognition, though not all of it is up to date on current research. It is used in my primate evolution course and provides an excellent outline on how to approach primate cognition and understand each aspect it consists of. Just be ready to do your own research on topics to see what new research has said to support (or refute) its claims"
5,Blank ... card ... guides,"These are exactly what they say, and serve quite nicely as dividers for recipe boxes. Being blank, the cook can organize recipes however she wishes - if she wants a category for Mexican food containing chicken, she can create such a card. The tab is not huge though, so that might have to be abbrevieted to something like ""Mex-Chick"" which might make some browsers think that this is really her boyfriend's list of former girlfriends, but perhaps that cannot be helped."
5,Works perfectly in altered composition books,"I used these ""sandwiched"" between scrapbook paper and composition book paper for altered comp books - gave them as gifts."
4,This band is ready for the college circuit.,"Stuarts Folly is ready for Athens, Boulder, Tempe and Austin. Enough edge in ""Sea of Green"" to keep the Georgia Theatre rocking, with enough melody in ""Song About Nothing"" and ""I Wanted to Tell You"" to propell Sonic Ruin into a Friday afternoon favorite in freshman dorms and sorority houses everywhere. The band's musical and lyrical depth and breadth should be enough to build a strong a strong, fun show to take to these college band meccas."
5,"If you like short stories, here's your book","I'm extremely familiar with the author's work and I think these short stories are some of his best, riveled only by those he composed for the ""Midnight Club."" The first story, about a boy who thinks he's dreaming when he's really not, is demented and fun. The second, a sequel to his book ""Master of Murder,"" is a neat twist on the first book. The third, a compelling and thought provoking glimse of future life, left me in tears. The fourth is a wildly futuristic story that speaks about the implications of present actions and how they affect the future in the long run. The fifth is a wicked story of a boy who decides to murder his girl friend. Finally, the sixth is a parody on an experience the author actually had. Read the book! The stories are short, fun and easy to understand!!"
3,storage shed parts,"I didn't open the package right away and now that I have opened it, I find that the right side of the shed has a broken part for where the hinge of the door goes. I think they should check their products more carefully and pack it better before shipping the Suncast Gs100B horizontal storage shed. Otherwise I would have given a higher rating."
1,NOT secure,"Bought this item for storage in my apartment building garage. I carted it home, very happy with the price. I put it together and loaded it up - great capacity. Only problem is, it does not lock securely. I put a lock on it, no problem. I then lifted the lid to see what would happen. I pushed up on the lid, which allows the left door to open.I know these types of units are not the most secure but I expect to make any would-be thief have to work a little if they want in my storage unit."
1,WARNING: Depth measurement not true - bad return policy,"I bought this horizontal storage shed to fit in a narrow space on the side of my house. The shed is advertised on Amazon and the Suncast web site as being 26"" deep. The real depth of the storage box is more than 26"" and the box says 26-1/2"". However, the hinges take up more room and the shed can only be opened by raising the top. To keep the top open, you'll need a few more inches to lean the top back. You should allow 29-30"" minimum. I didn't have that space. I tried to return the shed to RestockIt. Although they shipped from Sacramento to my home in Manhattan Beach, they insisted I return the shed at my cost to their Florida location. That would have cost $70 -- half the value of the shed. RestockIt said it was my fault because they shipped what I ordered but I ordered a shed to fit in a 26"" space. Another shed I ordered from Amazon was also too big but Amazon was had UPS pick it up without a problem."
1,Three months and still no shed?,"I ordered this item in January and the shipping time kept changing. Well, now that we are in July, it seems it will take just a few more months and perhaps my order might make it then. There is no excuse for this and I will just cancel the order and go to Target since Amazon doesn't seem to be able to fulfill the order.***DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T ORDER THIS ONLINE! THE SHIPPING COST (NOTE THE EXTRA $10 FOR THIS ITEM) AND THE FRUSTRATION OF GETTING IT SHIPPED IS NOT WORTH IT!"
1,piece of crap,"We were pretty tough on it, as we used it for trash storage but:The connecting pieces/panels fell apart all the timeLid stand brokeDoors wouldn't stay closedWind broke doors offWind blew it over...Just not very sturdy and way to flimsy for our use!"
2,Good luck contacting Suncast,"One major door piece arrived with a large split, preventing assembly of the shed. All you get from the warranty hotline is an answering machine and no one calls back.This article is poorly manufactured junk from an unresponsive manufacturer."
4,Thumbs up!,"This product was purchased to hold feed and hay for some of our animals. It is weather proof and a great size to do just what we wanted it to do. It was easy to assemble, too. I would definitely purchase another one in the future if I need additional space."
5,Great value,"It was very easy to assemble, no tools necessary. I think it was a great value. Slightly larger storage sheds sold for $200+ at Home Depot & Lowes. This was just what I needed & a great price."
3,ok for light duty work,This unit has a good price for the size / amount of storage space. It is not heavy duty but works fine for what I needed. I have it on my deck for winter storage and will probably move it during the summer.
4,good value and looks good too!,"I bought this shed in order to store a generator and 5 gallon gas can and it does so with room to spare. Assembly was fairly simple but common sense triumphed more than the instruction booklet. The most difficult aspect of assembly was the LATCH HANDLE. The opening provided in the door was a little too small to insert the latch. I rectified this by taking my oscillating tool and enlarging it by about 1/8 of an inch. This did the trick and the rest of the installation was a breeze. As another reviewer pointed out,security is NOT a strongpoint of this shed.If you plan on placing it in a location that is a little ""sketchy"",i'd think twice before entrusting any valuables within. Still, for whats its worth,i'd buy another."
5,Storage shed,I received the shed when they said. And the product was what I expected. But when I started to put it together it had two left hand sides. I called the company and they sent me the Right hand side promptly. I would recommend this product and the company.
2,"""No Tools Required"" not necessary a good thing","Assembly of the unit was relativey easy except for the fact that ""No Tools Required"" means that everything should snap together easily. Not so much. Putting together the first two pieces in the instructions caused immediate cracking of the plastic. Assembling the rear wall onto the base caused numerous fractures. The worst one happened attaching the front door sections. That required duct tape to hold it together as repacking and returning was not an option due to to box being destroyed by rain the day the item arrived.The cardboard deteriorated so returning it couldn't happen.After mending the three minor cracks and taping up the major fracture on the front, the unit is doing its job and housing a generator, empty fuel containers, hoses, a collapsed pet cage.... All the things I needed to find a secure place for. I just wish the materials were a bit more sturdy to be able to withstand the initial assembly."
4,"Good unit , could have bought cheaper at Sears","So back to my pool story , new filter and pump how to keep the elements off them so they last 15 years as the prior unit did exposed to the elements . I spent a lot of time and money trying to build a frame then it finally came to me. Buy a box like this , take the doors off , swing it round 180 degrees and cut holes for the pipes . The unit is plastic so wont rust , flat pack assembly so can assemble around the pipes . After plenty of measure 20 times cut once and help from my dad in the cutting the shed now covers and protects my pump , filter and pipes . Only downside ( and yes my wife told me to check and i didn't ) was we went to sears a week after I got this unit and found it for $40 less , ah well I cant be told can I."
2,Cracked and buckled,The cabinet arrived from Amazon in a sad condition. The very large package was left on my front door step without a packing slip. The very bottom of the cabinet was cracked close to the right front corner and the front left door was damaged (it buckled). The cabinet is much too large to return so I had to glue together the cracked part and live with the repair and the buckled front door.
5,The way oatmeal should taste,"I hate oatmeal (except in cookies with chocolate chips), but I love this stuff. Really good tasting. The price is good--that is it matches what I would pay for this item on sale in a grocery store, so that makes it a very good value, also."
4,Tip the cows,"The box was a little flimsy, and was bent when we got it. Although we think it was bent while shipping. it got here faster than expected, but when we opened the package it smelled like a smoke shop. One of the pieces looked like there was an error on it. We are pretty sure it was during manufacturing and can easily be fixed with a little bit of paint."
4,Santos Dumount - The Real Aviation Father,"The book is very interesting, well explained and catch your attention up to the end. There is only a small mistake in page 281 which refers to the pictures taken. When the book talked about aiplanes developed as shown in 1906 it stated that in the next page there is a French Aviator (lower right)who seems to be flying backward. In reality that Aviator is Santos Dumount flying in a plane called 14 BIS. Santos Dumount is Brazilian and he is considered the father of the Brazilian Air Force. Also in Brazil he is considered the Father of Aviation."
3,Starts Strong But Quickly Devolves Into Minutia,"...imho, mcneill's book starts strong, makes cogent points, but then quickly devolves into a morass of minutia...resulting in a tepid ending with no clearly stated thesis, and lukewarm impact all the way around......again, imho, it may have been preferable to focus on key developments that changed the course of warfare - with resulting consequences to the victors and the vanquished - then to relate how industry developed as a consequence in a ghoulish sort of 'virtuous-type-spiral', and, finally, to prognosticate where all of this will lead in terms of the final contours of an ultimate 'industrial-war-machine,' with resulting impact internally, externally and environmentally..."
3,just ok,"purchased this bath scrub instead of the one i usually (dead sea products) get, because it was larger size and cheaper. The smell is not near as good as dead sea and granules are smaller. It is ok but for a few more dollars i prefer dead sea salt scrub."
4,Fabfaire,I really like this product. For me it's more of a scrub slash skin polisher. It makes your skin so soft and smooth. I use this about twice a week and my skin stays soft during the in between days. I really bought this to use just for occasional pampering but between the subtle laveder scent and soft skin I use it more than I thought I would.
5,Beautiful Balladry !,Me Quede Vacia contains the lush and beautiful telenovela ballad El Alma No Tiene Color (The Soul Has No Color) by the same name. Again Laura shows off her passionate vocals on these wonderfully crafted romantic songs! Much of the songs here are mid-tempo ballads with a few dance-like (cumbia) sounding tracks that showcase how versatile Laura is. This is another highly recommended album by one of Mexico's popular soap star actresses and singers...
1,Don't Buy!,"Bought this system, on recommendation, in June 2003. System developed a ""popping"" sound and would shut itself down. By the beginning of August 2003, I finally got the replacement system and the same problem occurred two months later - October 2003. Since Novemeber 2003, I have been contacting Onkyo, by email & faxing, to have this system replaced, and they have not responded to me. To me, a bad system and bad customer service means a bad company. It is now April 2004 and I still have this broken down system sitting in the corner of my bedroom!"
2,mmmm...,I know it is a non-expensive item so I should not expect too much from it but i did not like it.
3,Takes some getting used to,Bought this calculator just to do H.S. level algerbra. The teminology in the textbook doesn't correspond to the calculator so it takes some trial and error and many visits to the online instruction book.
1,HP39GS,"i purchased this calculater because i thought HP could do no harm , but i been in my class for a little over a month and its been the harderst thing ever.the class is thought with a TI-8 and no one knows how to use HP39GS calculator. if you want to be stuck alone trying to figure out how to work the HP39GS then you should purchase it . overall spent a few more dollars on a another calculator that hasnt been discontinued"
2,Too much calculator,"All I got to say is if want something simple this will not be it, if you want something with difficult instruction this would be it."
5,very pleased,I am very pleased with this graphing calculator. I had to buy one for my grandson for school to use in math class. Everywhere I looked they want 50.00 all the way up to 150.00. I did not want to purchase it for that price so I went on the internet and found this one on amazon for only around 30.00. At that price it is doing what he needs to do for his classwork and if it gets lost or stolen I have not invested an amount that will break me. Thank you amazon.HP39GS Graphing Calculator
4,Great calculator for math classes!,"I bought this calculator because it is almost $100 CHEAPER than a TI calculator and it basically has all the same functions just you have to learn them. I did not want to shell out a hundred and something dollars for a calculator so I purchased this one for around $40.Like I said this calculator has all the functions as one of those TI calculators, just you have to learn how to use them.The only downside is that in a class full of people who have TI's, it is sort of hard to get help how to enter certain things because you have a different calculator.There are also a couple of improvements that I wish this calculator had, but so far so good! I recommend this to anyone who is looking to save money!"
3,Texas Instruments T1-83 calculator,It came dirty and the owners name was on the calculator and it won't rub off. When it was rated good condtion didnt look like it. I have ordered several items with amazon first time not a good pick. :(
3,Not what I expected,"I was a little disappointed with this cd. When I read the other reviews and based upon the title, I thought the music would have more vocals. When I think of Soulful House music, I expect vocals over banging beats. This was borderline techno or electronica in my opinion. Just so-so from an old school house head."
1,I think the movie was the worst I have ever seen,"I did not understand it, it just went on with some guy running on and on with no meaning. There was no plot and no purpose. It was complete and utter trash!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Average Headphones,"I just picked up a pair of these headphones this week. Other than the look, I'm not overly impressed with them. I'm using them with my iPod mini. I find that even the generic iPod headphones sound just as good if not better than these. These headphones are also pretty quiet. I have to turn the volume on the iPod much louder in order to get the same volume as the iPod headphones (maybe that will change once they're broken in?). Another problem or rather disappointment I had was with the length of the wire. The wire for the right earbud is almost 3 times longer than the left. This is to keep the wire off to the side of your body instead of in the middle. The problem with this is when I jog, the extra weight on the left earbud causes it to constantly pop out of my ear.Bottomline -> If you're looking for great sounding headphones, look elsewhere, but for the cheap price you'll get a cool looking, decent sounding set of headphones. 3 stars."
5,Very Excited about this publication,"As the title indicates, I'm very excited about this book being completely re-published. Both my grandfather and great uncle are in the book (pictures included) with a bit of information about each. It was through this book that I learned by grandfather was gassed in action. This is MUST have for anyone who had family in the 26th division from the Holyoke area."
1,not very good quality,"I have 2 of these units and have had issues with both. The first unit had a bad external video box. I called philips to get this fixed and I have made 4 attempts to order this part and every time they have sent me the wrong part.I purchased a second unit to use as a multimedia player for music. This time all the cables were good, but this particular unit has a buzzing in the background no matter which source you choose.I have done some research and turns out that most other owners are getting the same background noise. This is not normal. My original unit does not have this noise.Stay away from this product if you are picky about sound quality."
3,Good for parties w/ other speakers,Radio is trash and at low volume there is a buzz but I keep it cranked to max and it can handle the load of 3 additional 30W+ speakers. Sound quality is above average at this level but no means exceptional. Looks good on the bar!
4,great system for the money,"You can't beat this system for the price, the sound is awesome, simple hookup, the only con was that the speakers are hardwired, and the wires are simply not long enough"
3,It was okay,the book was not all what I expected it could have been better. I MIGHT SAY SO but reader what do you think of the book?
2,Overpriced and not as powerful as the Power 2000 NiMH AAs,"Don't waste your money on these Canon batteries. They're rated for only 2100 mAH (milliAmp Hours).J&R; Music carries the Power 2000 NiMH AA batteries (part# XP4AA-27). These are rated at 2700 mAH, and they're priced about 40% less. It takes a LOT of photo shooting to tire out those babies. I STRONGLY recommend them for digital cameras."
1,Expensive and non-functional,"I trust Canon products, always have. I bought these very pricey batteries for my newly purchased Canon S2 IS camera. I put 'em in, no charge. Ok, charged 'em up, put 'em in, they were good for about 5 pictures. Recharged them, they were good for about 4 pictures. I'm charging them a third time...guess we'll see, but so far standard-issue, CHEAP AA batteries are lasting far far longer. I'm sure I got a bad batch, but nonetheless, I paid $$ for a BAD batch of batteries..."
5,Best Set of NiMH that I own,I've bought 5 sets of 4 batteries for my sons digital photography business. ( www.realtourservices.com ) and we discovered that we can use these batteries 50% longer than any other set when we are taking pictures with flash. Very impressive quality.JR FentRecruiterwww.jrfent.com
1,CANON NiMH Battery NB4-200,"My Batteris are dead, I put them in my camera and they didnot work. I want to return them. I bought them in May,2005 I just open them August 14, 2005. I rate them a ""0""Betty J McDonald701 Oats St #309Texarkana AR 71854shebj@aol.com"
4,A good read,"A readable, thought provoking series of stories on the theme of nanotechnology. Eight short stories, one poem and a novella. No bad stories and one truely great one.I liked this book a lot. I had only read one of the stories before in a magazine anthology. The others were new to me.The highlight of the book is ""We were out of our minds with joy"" by David Marusek. This story has enough in the way of ideas and development potential to spawn a novel. The price is worth paying for this novella alone. Indeed, at the price, it seems like a bargain!While Marusek is still an emerging talent, other authors featured here such as Bear, Egan, di Fillipo and Baxter will be more familiar.At the end of the book, the editors add a list of further reading on the same subject. I will be following up a number of their suggestions."
4,On the Beach- 2001,"On the beach is a moving drama of what the world would be like if China and America annihilated each other with nuclear war and the slow poisoning of the earth as radioactive dust slowing drifts to each pole. There is no escape, no where to hide from it. But there is a glimmer of hope as some scientists calculate the deadly drift of dust may not travel as far as expected.A story revolving around a lone US submarine captain and his crew and their search for a future, to start again, and an Australian family trying to come to grips with what might be their last few weeks on this earth.A story that will change the way you look at life."
1,OMG This is AWFUL,"I loved the original movie (with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner) when I saw it a few months ago, and then read the book. Both were great.This movie remake, however, is absolutely terrible. Armand Assante simply cannot act. Rachel Ward was all too predictible as Moira, and the dialogue that was invented for this version was excrutiating.Stick with the originals - this one will make you cringe."
2,"Read the book, it is much better.","I bought this DVD to use as a comparison for the book by the same title. As a stand alone it probably would be a good film, but compared to the original book by the same title - it was awful. So much of the story lines were changed and some of the film was chopped up that it didn't make sense from the book."
5,On The Beach,"I have always liked Armand Assante, and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. It's a very compelling story about the horrors of someone in some country deciding to push the nuke button. Rachael Ward does a good job portraying a maturing hedonist, who as the story unfolds indulges herself in a somewhat complicated love triangle. All in all, the movie is definitely worth watching."
2,Stick with the original,"While interesting, this version is over the top in areas that simply don't contribute to the story. Captain Towers in unbelievable as a nuclear navy sub commander. Julian Osborne is unbelievable as a government scientist. Moira Davidson is unbelievable as anything other than a complete bitch. The only characters that improved with this telling are Peter and Mary.As noted in previous reviews, the tech flaws include a blinking corpse. In addition, when Bill Gates or Dell comes up with a solar battery powered laptop--someone let me know, OK?Kramers original is still the best. You could hardly go wrong with a cast and script like that.If you're a die hard ""End Of The World"" film geek like me, then this is a must own. Just don't spend more than US10 on it."
5,Still A Must See,"Hands down better than 1959 version. I found the characters to be much more compellingly portrayed. All of the roles were played well. Having been a Navy wife...I found Armand Assante's somewhat gruff, somewhat swagering, yet sympathetic Towers pretty accurate for a sub commander. Brian Brown as always pitch perfect. Rachel Ward's character beleivable and fun. The young couple with daughter really caught my attention. Let's see more of Grant Bowler."
2,I wasn't aware that this movie contained all the vulgar language,Not a bad movie if they weren't compelled to put in all the vulgar language.
2,TIRESOME RETREAD,"Originally aired as a t.v. miniseries, this remake of ON THE BEACH by Nevil Shute is tiresome and tedious. The leads (Armand Assante, Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown) are outacted by relative unknowns Grant Bowler and Jacqueline Mackenzie, who play the Australian couple trying to maintain optimism in a world that looks bleak. The movie ultimately becomes a dull love story focusing on an alcoholic woman (Ward) and her involvement with submarine admiral (Assante). She also has a past with scientist Brown. The movie also ends quite abruptly and without any real resolution; a bummer in my book."
5,On the Beach,"I really, really enjoyed this movie. It helped that I recognised the locations where it was filmed. The Australian actors are outstanding but I found Armand Assante's acting a bit wooden. It seemed he couldn't open his mouth to speak very clearly. Howver, overall a very pleasing film."
3,Has its strengths and weaknesses.,"Comparing it with the theatrical movie with Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire etc, it has its strengths - one being Australian actors in the Australian roles, and who perform well. Assante is very good in the Peck role while Bryan Brown is a little 'over-cooked' in the Astaire role, but Rachel Ward (Mrs Brown) is excellent. Impact of story is powerful, and it has a slightly more 'satisfying' last scene than the 1959 movie. As a mini-series, twice as long as the original which gives more time for story development, although it is rather slow and overly-'wordy' in places. Overall a 'solid' product."
4,On the Beach - Very good made for TV movie,"This remake of On the Beach was surprisingly good and I rate it at four stars as an excellent made for TV movie. The part of the submarine commander played by Armand Assante was the most interesting and entertaining role in the film. Assante did a great job in an unusual role!The story takes some slightly different turns than the original movie but still basically told the same depresssing but very engaging tale of an extremely moral US submarine commander who takes his duty to the country and his family very seriously. The movie tells the story of his encounters with various people in Australia who blamed the US for the war and its ultimate outcome. He always stood up for his country and shared with almost no one what to him was probably a dark secret.As an aside which I can't help but comment on, the sets of the submarine were excellent and looked really credible. The special effects were also very well done. I liked this film."
3,Buy the original 1959 film instead...,"Yes, buy the original 1959 film instead. The cast (Gregory Peck, Fred Astaire, Ava Gardner, and Anthony Perkins) is FAR better than the retreads in the new version. Direction by Stanley Kramer and the beautiful score by Herman Gold also make the original film by far the best choice. For those reviewers upset that the film does not have a happy ending, please consider renting Cinderella from Disney Studios. The original 1959 film was also a masterpiece in that it was a film with an anti-war theme from the 1950's. Quick, how many other anti-war films from the 1950's can you name?"
2,The book was better,"""On the Beach"" by Nevil Shute is one of my all-time favorite books. I hate when they remake books into an entirely different story. I've seen the movie with Ava Gardner, snore. This one was a little better, but those who haven't read the book, I promise you are in for a great read."
2,Not realistic at all,"It's been known for a while now, thanks to computer simulation that total nuclear war in the northern hemisphere would not result in significantly harmful fall out or radiation in the sourthern hemisphere. This movie is very unrealistic from a scientific point of view. I just hope that people who view this, don't consider it as scientific 'fact'."
1,Insult to a Great Movie and Greater Novel,"The 2005 Aussie-US remake of On the Beach is beyond bad. Out goes atomic war, in comes some kind of eco-catastrophe. I think the poor souls that like this train-wreck never saw the 1960 version with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner - it was easily the best Cold War movie ever made and remains very powerful. (It ought to considering the cast which included Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire in his finest dramatic film role.)Even the good version of the movie, however, does not capture the genius of Nevil Shute's great novel. The books is understated and elegant in the 1950's manner (that is good) and the characters beautifully developed. This makes the book believable and thus utterly terrifying. Anyway, give this turkey a pass and get a used copy of the 1960 flick and, better yet, a copy of the novel."
2,Worth reading once,"I think the author makes some good points that explain how generation X and Y think and make decisions and relate to others. After about the first half of the book it doesn't seem to offer as much ""meat"" as the beginning of the book. Instead, in a strange way, the book goes on to discuss endless case studies with the basic theme of pampering your customer. For $7 it is worth reading once. After which you can donate it to the public library."
2,It's OK - give it an extra star if you like marketing books,"I found other books more enlightening on the subject matter. For example, ""The Tipping Point"" was more interesting on the topic of product mavens/evangelists. ""Keeping The Millennials"" was more interesting on what the Millennials, aka Generation Y, seek.This book does have some insights:- Engage Gen Y by with interactive marketing, test drives.- Gen Y people are not passive - they like to give their input on product direction, quality, etc.- Word of mouth, though it sounds old fashioned, is very very important for Gen Y- Create an experience to differentiate a product. e.g., Apple Genius Bar versus HP Telephone Support"
2,Exploded in my hands,"Used it couple of times and did not have major issues except for some occasional spills. But few days ago I poured hot boiled water and closed the lid. I picked it up from the counter in 5 minutes and it exploded in my hands blowing off the plastic and spilling the hot water on me. It burned my fingers and it was very painful. I think it's a design flow since the plastic neck attached to the metal was not able to withstand the high pressure, but I thought thermoses were designed to do exactly that."
1,think of it as a very large mug as opposed to a bottle,"The top part is the same as the smaller coffee mug oxo makes. This makes it great to drink from, but horrible to pour out of. As others have said the insulation isn't the best either. To me it wasn't a waste of money since I'm just going to use it as a giant mug and I don't need it to stay warm until the evening. Last time I used it, I filled with 200 degree F coffee and at 6:00 am, I didn't use it until 2 pm and when I poured it out it was room temp maybe slightly warm.So used as a large mug, used immediately (or within a few hours) after filling, it's not bad.EDIT (end of Dec 2009):I just threw it out. It doesn't hold heat anymore (about 1 month of use) and there is nothing redeeming abou it anymore."
2,Bring a wad of napkins along,"The Oxo Good Grips LiquiSeal Thermal Beverage Container keeps my coffee hot, at least for a few hours. But it leaks and it dribbles worse than a wine bottle when you pour from the spout. Pack it with a wad of napkins and you'll be fine."
2,Below average travel thermus for a premium price,"I'm a fan of Oxo, no doubt, but there are some products that they make that are of questionable design and quality. The higher price for this item doesn't match up with the fair design and function. Spilling always occurs as a result of liquid catching and running down the side towards the end of a pour. There doesn't seem to be a way to prevent this, at least in a any reasonable fashion. All they needed to do was to test the product, very obvious school boy mistake. It doesn't function well as a thermus either. Liquids stay hot but not for long. If it was cheaper then it might gain a star but for the price it's not a good buy."
5,Love it!,"A wonderful travel mug, with real capacity for real coffee drinkers! Does NOT leak! I leave the cap (a drink cup if you're sharing) at home to save on the weight. Only wish for a handle."
1,explodes!,"unlike the smaller version from OXO this has a major design problem. when fully sealed for travel it does not vent off enough steam to prevent the entire plastic top from popping off at the seam. = hot liquid everywhere! burning your hands, liquid in your briefcase, etc! As far as I know it is the only high capacity (24oz) thermos that you can drink from directly, so I am now at a loss to replace it, as this is ideal for me to sip as I drive to work and still have coffee for the office too. OXO fix this problem please!"
1,Terrible.,"It would be passable for it's mediocre heat-retaining ability, but the main problem is the sealing mechanism, which is a disc threaded onto the underside of the cap. More than once it didn't seal right and cheerfully leaked coffee all over my car. The little disc thing also gets lost in the sink and dish rack. I was happy to throw this thermos out after six weeks of use."
2,"Yeah, it was funny the first time","Foxtrot might be funny for the first year you read it, but soon you too will realize he seems to play the same jokes over and over again every year. Every year I will hear something of how Peter is going to eat a million turkeys and every year I will read that Jason's Christmas list needs a semi to deliver it to the north pole. Bill Amend needs some new inspiration besides making jokes simply by exagerration. I personally recommend he read Calvin & Hobbes, Get Fuzzy, or Dilbert for inspiration on how to make a good comic. If your looking for a gift for a nephew or son, I reccomend you get him a Calvin & Hobbes book. This is clearly the best comic ever written and now that Bill Wattersons been retired so long his books are at reduced price. Dont waste your time on comics where you find yourselves shouting out the punch line before you actually read it anymore!"
5,The Absolute Best Cologne!,"I have been using Four Paws Black for fifteen years. Just a couple of little sprays will do it and it lasts for days. Whenever we are out in public with our Pekingese, everyone raves about how wonderful she smells.You will not be disappointed with this cologne!!"
1,decieving,"this product shows 5 cans of spray, however you only get one, I would not have ordered this product if I had known this."
1,Watch out on this one.,"A few years ago, Merle Haggard sat down and remade almost all of his biggest hits in a mamoth recording session. Now all of these songs are spreading around to every cheap record company who repackages them.Be careful, everything here is remakes."
2,Never bloomed,"It could be my soil or climate, but this never bloomed - despite my tender loving care."
4,Great Bag,I got this bag for Christmas this year and I love it. It's the perfect size for the weekend and very pretty colors. It stood out at the airport enough for me to find it and there's plenty of room for a few days clothing! Trust me on that one. I'd say it's completely worth the money. The only problem I had was a small problem with the stitching on the end tabs. Nothing too serious and they'll correct the problem.
4,Great bag,"The Olive N Figs Flora Spring weekender/duffel bag was everything I expected and more -- its quality rivals even the best manufacturers of expensive bags. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a fashionable, roomy weekend duffel."
2,Not what I was expecting.,This bag was not quite what I was hoping for-- the fabric was thin and did not seem durable enough to last more than a couple trips; the bag was unlined; there were no pockets on the inside; the cranberry reds and pinks in the fabric of the bag were accompanied by apple red straps and bottom. I certainly would not have paid $40 for the bag. I returned it in search of something more substantial.
5,Mary Lou's Review,"Length:: 1:12 MinsA few years ago, ninety-year old Mary Lou was diagnosed with Macular Degeneration. Since she lives alone, she was very concerned. After twenty treatments with the Santa Fe Eye Protocol, over a period of 2 years, both her near and distant vision has improved by over five lines, which now enables her to read a newspaper and do her calligraphy which she loves."
5,"Yes, there is hope.","The prospect of losing your vision to Age-Related Macular Degeneration is a terrifying thought, yet this is happening to thousands of people world-wide. For those of you with little or no hope left, take heart! Dr. Alston Lundgren, a Santa Fe, New Mexico-based physician, is a smart, compassionate, wonderful human being, and his Santa Fe Eye Protocol is little short of a miracle. I've seen the results of Dr. Lundgren's Protocol, the quality of life it restores, and the passion Dr. Lundgren expresses through his work. I've mentioned Dr. Lundgren to many friends and associates, and everyone seems to know someone who suffers with AMD. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone who suffers from macular degeneration or who knows a sufferer. It will answer many of your macular degeneration questions and introduce you to Dr. Lundgren's Protocol. An added bonus is that one of Dr. Lundgren's staff will give you a free consultation when you buy this DVD. What are you waiting for?"
4,Interesting book,"The book was very interesting. The only downfall was that it was repetitive at times, however still very interesting. Enjoyed reading"
2,Very difficult read,"This book is poorly organized and difficult to stay interested in. Although some of the stories are interesting, the way they are presented is a bit boring."
5,I can't put this book down..,"A very well written account of the stupidity and plain bad luck of people who were killed in the Grand Canyon by various run ins with the nature of the canyon.Having walked from the south rim to the north rim and back myself, and experiencing the 115 degree heat, running out of food and water too soon, the dizzying, dazzling vistas, and actually having the sole of my hiking boot break off, and having to walk 3/4 of the canyon looking for socks on the trail to put over my boot, and borrowing duct tape from a ranger, and suffering from near hypothermia as we battled back up to the South rim, from Indian gardens in a drenching cold rain...It really brought back memories, and realizations of the close possibility of being a statistic. There for the grace of God go I.What a great book... I havn't read one like this in a long time. I literaly cannot stop reading it.I hope these guys right a sequel.."
4,Required reading!!,"If you're contemplating a trip of any kind into Grand Canyon, this should be high on the list of research materials. If you're beyond contemplation and you're assembling your gear, this should be on TOP of your list to read before you go. It's a quick read and efficiently provides the reader with everything from ""entertainment"" in the style, to data and statistics that help even the experienced canyon trekker stay real and more importantly, safe.We're not only given reminders of what we should and shouldn't do, but vivid examples of the ""why"" so many people seem to need. It also serves as a reminder that, as always, sh-- happens!! No matter how well planned and prepared some are, there are some things that go beyond our control, as illustrated in the text.This one has a home in my ""Canyon Library"" as it will be read more than once.Happy Trails!!"
5,Excellent & Interesting read,This book is great. It isn't just the deaths but all the stories and how one would get into such a situationt. All of thisn has happened in the grand Canyon. From the very bizzare to the crazy ones. It's intriguing and keeps you reading. My only issue is I wish I would have read this book Prior to visiting the canyon. Now I'll have to go back for sure. We are currently planning a hiking trip for next year.
4,Interesting Facts,Since I had just been to the Grand Canyon I had seen the book there for twice the price and also since it is a thick book was not convenient to put in suitcase.
4,"""Just take a couple of steps back, and Smile!""","You can't help but admire the macabre detail. While the same genre as Whittlesey's ""Death in Yellowstone,"" it seems somehow less academic. Probably, it's the editorializing of the various mishaps that gives the book its 'lite' affect.The big plus in the authors' style is their inclusion of current commentary from victims or their acquaintances, sometimes decades after the event. The downside of their style is the authors' persistent, arrogant, almost obligatory editorializing. And their purported solutions to two big Grand Canyon mysteries seem a little trite. All in all, it's a keeper for any Canyon historian."
4,More than just a catchy title,"No doubt, the title and cover are intriguing enough to draw you in, but the material inside keeps you there. It's not just a dry review of a horrible subject, but it also contains gripping stories of daring rescues and near-misses. As an outdoorsman myself, I found it to be an educational eye-opener too. The Boy Scouts know the message - ""Be Prepared"". A real page-turner."
4,Warning,We have a trip planned to hike into the canyon. I wanted everyone to be aware of the dangers and I think this book does a good job of presenting those dangers. I'll write more later...if we make it out!
4,Pretty Good,"Even if you've not been to the Grand Canyon,this book is worth the read. Particularly if you're morbid."
3,"Fascinating, to a point...","I don't know why I was attracted to this book...I've never even seen the Grand Canyon. I guess we all are fascinated by fate and death and bizarre stories while we are sitting safe. I enjoyed this book at first and then as the chapters went by, I started to do a bit of skimming. Each chapter has a theme (falling, suicide, murder, etc.) which was intriguing. However once I read a few stories of each, I felt that I could skim the rest and move onto the next chapter. I did like how at the end of each chapter they listed all the stats of the poor people who lost their lives. What are the odds that two large airlines would collide over the Grand Canyon??? What a way to go; poor souls.I did like the writing and the humor, despite the sad topic. I do know that if I ever go to the Grand Canyon, no one is getting me to back up to take my picture!"
1,Horrible book!!!!!!!!1,"The book Over the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon was very dull, and dead! It started out really slow. The beginnin was terrible! The middle was horrible! The end was horrible also! The whold book was very, very pointless! The book was gawky and said the same thing over and over again! NO one should read this book! I believe that this book is lifeless! If you liked this paragraph, and if it was easy to read, then you will enjoy the book Over the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon, becuase this is as horrible as the book!"
5,Required Reading for any visitor to Grand Canyon,The authors of this book give you an honest look at the danger that exists in Grand Canyon. I found this book easy to read. There were enough details provided to give you a clear picture of the events that were unfolding. The book is broken into chapters that each deal with a different type of danger that visitors face. I could not believe the amount of people who fail to prepare for hikes into the canyon by having enough water!Every National Park visitor should be required to read this book so that the avoidable mistakes that are so common can be avoided. I was amazed to learn that so many people die in Grand Canyon because they do not take the proper precautions. This book kept me interested until the last page. The authors provide useful tables on fatalies at the end of each chapter.
5,Updated Version???,"I saw this book in the North Rim gift shop, but figured i could alway pick it online later. In the gift shop copy I looked at there were stories from 2009, but the publish date here (and everywhere else I look online) is 2001.Can anyone who has recently ordered this book from Amazon tell me if the version they recieved includes the most recently updated stories??? Thanks!BTW...It looks like a very cool book!"
5,Great book!,"I thought the book was fascinating and my husband liked it, too! It certainly gave me a healthy new respect for the perils of nature and man's limitations in dealing with it. It should be required reading for all visitors. From a nurse's standpoint I think the authors did a great job explaining things, like the effects of dehydration, in a way that most people could understand and benefit from if they knew them before they visited. Buy it because it's a compelling read. I read it aloud to my husband as we crossed western Kansas on the way home from the Canyon. The time flew by and we got lots of good information and advice in the bargain."
1,"A sad, sad misunderstanding","Maybe I'm being unfair (I actually did not read the essays because I returned it immediately), but the title and the description of the book suggested that the actual TEXTS of the grail cycle would be included in the book; they are not. This book is just a collection of essays ABOUT the grail cycle, which is great if that's what you're looking for; if you're looking for the grail stories, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Look elsewhere, for the love of god, look elsewhere."
3,texts and transformations metaphorical,"I was rather mislead by the subtitle of this work of essays, since it seems to imply it contains the ""texts"" and its ""transformations"" which was what interested me about the book in the first place. The essays are great and far ranging in scope."
3,"Cute,but not very heavy!","The quality not very great on the clips,they rusted quickly. A shame each item was very small and not heavy enough to hold down much. Very disapointed!"
3,colors not as seen on the picture,"Colors in tehe picture are more vivid, they look more atractive on the photo than in real life. Although I liked them"
3,Mr. Bar-B-Q Tablecloth Weights,"These seem to be made very well, however I really wish they were all the same size. The larger ones (corn cob and hot dog)are perfect as they are heavy and very cute. The smaller ones are too light and way too small compared to the others."
4,Christmas poo with a twist,"The three episodes on this tape are as funny as most South Park material but the Christmas musical is by far the best. The collection of songs include Mr.Garrison singing ""Merry ........ Christmas"" and a priceless version of ""Holy Night"" sung by Eric Cartman. An interesting ""sweetner"" on this DVD is the BBC documentary about the South Park show, narrated by Trey and Matt together in a jacuzzi with a Japanese friend. If you have already bought the other South Park DVD's, this should be the next one on your list. Also,if you are a die hard fan, look into Cannibal: The Musical. It was Trey and Matt's first movie from their college years in Colorado. The Cannibal movie is terrible but the accompanying directors commentary alone is worth the price. You also can see long time friend Dean Bachar in that one."
4,Awsome Episodes,"South Park is one of my favorite shows and this video has some of my favorite episodes on it! The first episode on the tape ""Spookyfish"" is best Halloween episode from the series and is brought to you in ""Spookyvision"". In 'Spookyfish"" Stan gets a pet goldfish from his aunt, but suspects that his new fish might be the cause of strange murders plauging the town. The second episode ""Gnomes"" is hilarious and introduces the character Tweek. In ""Gnomes"" the boys are assinged to do a report on current events with Tweek and meet a gang of Gnomes that want to steal underpants for a profit but cant figure out how to get the money. I recommend this tape to anyone who likes South Park or other raunchy cartoons."
3,A Long Haul . . .,"But worth it in the end. I'm a slow reader by nature, and this took me some time to get through.Although I haven't read an awful lot of Dostoyevsky, I wouldn't say this was my favourite so far, which is not to say I didn't enjoy it. It can be slow and heavy going at times, but that is to be expected due to the sheer richness of such a large novel - the notes to the text are also a wonderful guide to such a thick prose and I'd have been greatly lost without them. That said, and I don't wish to at all bring spoilers to my review, I did enjoy The Idiot more, just for the deeply dark ending that novel contained compared to this one, the ending of which left me a little unsatisfied, despite the sense of achievement of having finally finished the book!If you like other novels from the era, and can patiently read large slabs of monologue and the like, stick this one out and you will be rewarded."
1,bad translation,"no need to talk about the greatness of this book. indeed it is worthy of the Uber-classic status it enjoys today. i am writing this review as a service to potential customers. do buy the book. read it, stop to think about it, take notes, but dont do so with the penguin edition. i picked up this edition because it was cheaper than some of the others i had to choose from and because i thought it had a cool cover photo, i didnt take translation into account. never had untill then. the penguin edition is longer and whoever translated it over-intellectualized it. its a tougher read than the vintage edition, which flows better and will be much more enjoable. so i urge you all to get the vintage classics edition. it'll cost you a bit more but its well worth it."
3,"Long, Sprawling, Pointless","After 985 pages of melodramatic, overwrought speech-making that is ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" I learned that Russians like to talk, like to womanize, like to drink, like to talk about God, and like to think about killing their fathers. I tried very hard to seek reasons why this book is considered a literary classic, and the only reason I could come up with was that the publishing industry and universities need to create literary classics in order to survive as viable businesses. I think highly of Leo Tolstoy, but Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a sorry disappointment. The characters are lame, the plot both overly simple and overly convoluted at the same time, the writing anything but concisely edited."
2,The Brothers Karamazov- review,The book has been translated several time by different editors and in different languages. Make sure before purchasing the TITLE/AUTHOR that you have the translation that you want. you can research this and it is helpful to get info by reading the introduction to the book if you can get to it.
2,"Great bag, weak tie","I have had the ties break and had to clean up a mess several times. Why make such a good, strong bag, and pair it with a breakable tie??? Nobody is filling them half way, or with foam popcorn. They used to be better, but changed the ties."
4,Great Sounds,"I bought this book for my 9-month old grandson. He is too young to follow the story, but he enjoys the sounds. As his attention span grows, he will be able to follow the story. At that point I'm sure he will enjoy the book even more. I would recommend this book for children ages 3 and under. I am giving it four stars rather than five because I would like to see the written story spread out over more pages with more pictures to help the young child's comprehension."
5,great!,this was great! no complaints! i bought it as a gift..and would for sure buy another in the future. thanks!
3,Great but dull,"The Mezzaluna is nice, however it's rather dull. As a result some greens go un-chopped unless you place a lot of pressure on the Mezzaluna."
4,Good First Road Picture,"This is the first of seven road pictures (starring Bing and Bob) and it is a good one. I read where the movie was originally set to star George Burns and Gracie Allen in the two lead roles ... when it was then adapted for Bing and Bob.Some good acting here. The later road pictures put the zany actics and funny gag lines way up front ... as they should ... for our enjoyment, but The Road to Singapore has more of a credible plot and better acting. Dorothy Lamour is an excellent actress. Her one scene near the end, on the ship deck with Bob, is pretty special.My rank for this road picture (among the seven) is third or fourth. And it's just fun to see the boys at the beginning of what would become a great series of motion pictures."
3,TOO ROMANTIC,"That's the title of the best-known tune which was introduced in this first entry in the immensely popular ROAD TO.... series. In this one, Josh Mallon, the scion of a straightlaced shipping magnate, and his free-spirited pal, Ace Lannigan, ridicule the institution of marriage. However, Josh's Dad is disgusted with his son's irresponsible antics & commits Josh to an office job and a marriage to socialite Gloria Wycott...The working title of this just-average first outing from the famed duo of Hope & Crosby was FOLLOW THE SUN. Other songs which are heard in the picture are: SWEET POTATO PIPER, KAIGOON, THE MOON AND THE WILLOW TREE & CAPTAIN CUSTARD (!). In 1940, the Ohio Censorship Board demanded that the studio (Paramount) make extensive cuts in the native dancing girl sequence."
4,The first stop of many worthwhile destinations,"I don't know why so many of the past reviewers put this film at the bottom of the list of ""The Road to . . ."" series. This is the film that started it all! It may lack some of the easy play and banter between Hope and Crosby as seen in the later films, but keep in mind this is the first time (1939-40) that Bing and Bob have been in a film together. As the years progressed, they were given more freedom to do what they liked given their bigger star status and the box-office successes of the earlier pictures. Despite what others may say, ""Singapore"" is an enjoyable film all the way through. It's embedded with gems like ""Captain Custard"" and ""Sweet Potato Piper"". The chemistry between Hope, Crosby, and Lamour is great -- you can tell they must have had a fun time making this movie :)I would definitely not leave this one out of my ""Road"" collection."
2,Opt for Morocco or Utopia instead,"This was the first Road movie and also one of the worst. Bob and Bing had not yet patented their trademark rapid-fire style and there's actually more of Lamour than Hope in this film (a bad omen). Bob was still a sort of ""juvenile"" backup to Bing in this movie and isn't given much to do. It's tragic to see Hope wasted liked this, but in 1940, he was still known more as a radio star than a full-fledged equal to Bing Crosby.If you want to sample some great road movies, get Morocco, Utopia or Rio, all of which are vastly superior to this rather average and dated film. The plot is leaden, the songs indifferent and the interplay between the incomparable Hope and Crosby team is lacking in most scenes."
3,"The first Road movie is fun, light-weight entertainment","Hope and Crosby go on the road for the first time and meet a very young Dorothy Lamour in her trademark sarong. The songs are entertaining, as are most of the jokes (especially those involving Jerry Colona), but the result isn't quite as much fun as some later entries in the series. Highlights include a major production number near the end in which South Sea islands sing in the language Esperanto!"
2,Least entertaining of the Road pictures,"Of all the Crosby-Hope road pictures, this one has dated badly and the humor is mostly sophomoric. The boys really hadn't hit their stride yet and this first road outing lacks, through most of its length, the inspired zaniness of Road to Morocco, Utopia, and Rio. Recommended only to those who want all of the Road pictures for the sake of completeness."
4,very emotional movie,"I ordered this movie because REX SMITH was in it and I am collecting all things I can find about him, so if you are a REX SMITH fan I would definitely get this movie. It was a very emotional movie and well acted. Enjoyed all the actors in this movie. The only negative thing I had was some of the language. Enjoyed the deleted and blooper scenes also. I would buy this movie again."
4,An Interesting Memoir of a Blue State Republican,"I found this book to be very interesting. This is through its discussion of how a Republican can win statewide office (through a dramatic landslide) and govern with reasonable effectiveness in a heavily urbanized (and Democratic) state with a significant minority population (living in New York, I can appreciate this situation). Kean is definitely a national spokesman for the center-right of the GOP, and it is too bad that he never tried to advance politically beyond New Jersey. As a moderately conservative Republican (moderate with respect to ""hot button"" social issues), I think that the Republican Party needs to do more to incorporate Kean's outlook. He has a strong record to show for his brand of Republicanism."
3,"Nice, but not for storing bird seed.","Easy to assemble. Nice amount of space. Looks tidy. Not the most sturdy, but decent. I used it to store bird seed. It took the squirrels a couple of years, but they finally did managed to chew through it enough to get in."
4,Great Deck Box BUT . . .,"Love the deck box -- lots of space for power tools, folding chairs and what-not. BUT after assembling the box, one of the last steps is to push in the hinges on the back. The instructions say to use a 1"" X 4"" piece of wood to knock the hinges into place. It's designed to hold a 1"" X 4"" piece of wood so you can hammer the hinges into their grooves. It just happens that I have NO WOOD! Why doesn't Rubber Maid provide that piece of wood?The box has been sitting there -- unable to be used until I can go to a lumberyard or call my son to find a lousy little piece of wood! If anyone has any suggestions on how one person can push in the hinges without the piece of wood, please post it.Otherwise it's a great product as other Rubber Maid products usually are."
5,Rubbermaid Extra large Deck Box with seat,"This is a very roomy box. I purchased two of them. One for basketballs, baseballs, skateboards and more. (The box I had prior to this was smaller and filled up quickly) The other box I use for circular pool floats, dive toys and pool noodles. Both boxes are great. I would definately repurchase these boxes. There are so many possibilities that one could use these boxes for. These are LARGE boxes. Easy to assemble. As far a using them as a bench, I probably wouldn't make a habit out of it. Yes, you can sit on it, but just like any other plastic product, it may have a tendicy to stretch or bottom out. There wouldn't be any problem for kids under 100 lbs, but in my opinion, I don't think these were made to hold a large amount of weight on the top of the box."
5,Excellent Storage Space,"We are very impressed with the quality of the materials used in the manufacturing of this deck box. The assembly was extremely easy and the parts interlocked perfectly. We're using it for storage in the garage, but it would be a good purchase for use outside - regardless of the weather conditions."
5,This box is perfect!,"We have kids! Thus, we have tons of toys! We needed a place to keep the baseball bats, baseballs, noodles, frisbees, soccer balls, footballs, lawn darts, water guns, etc...This box is located in our backyard year round. Anything inside is safe from the elements such as snow, rain, ice, wind, & animals.Took about 12 minutes to put together. Grown adults can sit on it with no fear of it caving in. The kids are constantly jumping up & down on it & it shows absolutely no wear & tear after 2 years now.The deck boxes at the local box stores were way too small & I would've gladly paid another $40 for this one if I had to.I usually don't write reviews but, felt I had to tell someone about how happy we were to purchase this deck box. I'm sure you'll love it!"
4,Assembly - NO Problems,I had read some reviews indicating that folks had trouble assembling this item. Took me longer to get it out of the box than to put it together - maybe 15 minutes total. It is everything it is supposed to be. Rubbermaid did a good job.
3,You get what you pay for...,"I've seen some folks try to compare this to fiberglass dock boxes, which are typically much more expensive, but there is really no comparing the two. This item is fine for storage under a covered porch, but I doubt its ability to take what an expensive dock box can handle. It should be noted that the rubbermaid unit is far from air tight. Once all sides come together, there is plenty of room for small critters and moisture to get in. Should not be considered for areas where rain might rise above the one inch or so bottom ""lip"". It remains to be seen how well the box holds up to the pounding Florida sun. Lastly, I was expecting a more brownish color than what it really is. The picture Amazon shows is not very accurate. I would describe the color as two tone grey. To Amazon's credit, at $15 it was shipped much more affordably than Target, who wanted $75.00!"
3,Dimensions listed are incorrect!,"The specs listed on Amazon say that this box is 66 inches long. It is actually only 60"" long. I purchased this item based on the dimensions given, and was unable to use it as intended due to the discrepency. It is otherwise a good sturdy storage box..very easy to assemble."
2,Rubbermaid is not made like you think,"The storage box went together ok, but where the locking parts inter-lock together, was a sloppy fit. It should be a solid fit. If the items are a little to wide (like Cushions) it will push out the sides. You can see where the corners have pulled apart some, this will cause a leak.I bought the deck box to keep a my new cushions dry and clean!"
5,Excellent Product,"Great size. Great construction. Very easy to assemble. Shipping for free is a plus, too. Nothing better than Rubbermaid."
4,still not large enough for lounge cushions.,"Was looking for storage for deck cushions, I should have noticed measurements. Other than that very nice."
5,Deck Box,I had a difficult time finding a deck box large enough and sturdy enough to hold my patio cushions. This box definitely fits the bill!
5,Perfect size,"I was happy with this purchase. I wanted a storage box that would fit in a specific spot on my patio. Having extra seating is a plus as well. It keeps all the items dry, in my case, I have about 8 cushions and 4 pillows in there from my outdoor furniture. They stay perfectly day, and it's been raining for the past week where I live, so that's a plus! It was also very easy to put together, according to my boyfriend. I have no complaints!"
2,It cannot be closed properly just after one summer,"Initially it was great- good looking and not so hard to assemble, but just after a summer, the cover cannot be closed and all the joints are somewhat disconnected. Should have bought sth better."
3,"So Far, So Good","I hate putting things together. When I read other reviews referencing the inadequate instructions, I almost didn't buy. Nevertheless, I pulled the trigger because I needed storage space near the pool.The long and short is that the box was easy to assemble, even though the instructions tried to make it hard. It's as if Rubbermaid just didn't care. However, in spite of the poor instructions, I got the box together in 30 minutes. You could probably do it in 15 minutes. If I buy another one, it'll take 10 minutes after unpacking.The product is lovely to look at, and I only hope it will keep my chair cushions dry and pollen-free. Because I don't know how I'll like it next spring and because I'm aggravated that the manufacturer sends the product out with such little assembly support, I'm rating it only three stars. If it would keep my stuff clean, I would add a star."
5,Fantastic Poolside Deck Box.,"I own two of these now. Lightweight but strong. Awesome storage space. Great value too. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
3,expected more,"The size and color was nice but the ""fit and finish"" was disappointing. The lid arrived warped and subsequently only fully closes on one side. Maybe I can somehow heat it and straighten it but I shouldn't have to. Sending it back is a hassle as well."
5,Rubbermaid Review,I found the Rubbermain Extra Large Desk Box with Seat to be exactly what I needed to store large patio cushions. I am very pleased with the product which was easy to assemble.
2,Mishka,"I have been anxiously awaiting another release from Mishka ever since his first self-titled cd. Unfortunately, it was quite a dissapointment. The first cd was amazing. Every track is a classic in my eyes. On One Tree, there are maybe 2 decent songs (out of 8)... none of which can touch any one song from his first cd."
1,Confused... and disappointed....,"I had the same problem as another reviewer. I placed the new CD into my drive and it prompted me to install ""FED LOG"" -- some sort of governmental search program. I have found information on the web on Fed Log but it seems to be some sort of restricted software. After hearing Mishka on his website I was eager to purchase the CD, but there is NO MUSIC on this CD, it's the Fed Log program only. What's the deal??"
1,Where is the music?,We bought the CD as a gift and there was no music on the CD. Instead there was a computer program. It was a database access program and no MUSIC. We called Amazon and discussed and received no resolution.
2,Just kept breaking,I bought two of these and returned them both because they did not work. We turned it once or twice and the propeller never turned. I bought the dive toy instead and the boys love it. (ages 2 and 4)
5,Excellant Deal!,"Very nice jacket, and fantastic price. Pendleton is known for it's quality wool products, and ordinarily I wouldn't be able to afford them. I bought this jacket as a gift for my Mom, and she really seemed to like it, and the brand! The cut is flattering - somewhat tailored, but plenty of room for a sweater, or whatever.I would have preferred the reverse side to be black instead of brown, but that's just personal preference. Also, it's itchy (wool), so you HAVE to wear long sleeves underneath (but probably would anyway).Overall, very nice!"
3,Cover Measurements,"Ironing Board Cover. Cover shown is 54"" long, but does not state how wide. Therefore difficult to decide if this product okay. Also, more information re ironing board material would be helpful."
3,Just a geeks observation,"Notice that they made this thing connect to a local number, which like in the old time we used to connect to a BBS instead of the internet...this means that the buyer of this thing will have to pay them and it will only work with Ceiva network. however, I would wait a bit... it will not take long before such digital frame will be able to connect and do the exact same thing using.. (drums please...) the Internet O-: what an amazing thing ha? and not only that, it will also be adjustable so you can use any site and not just the site of the company that made the digital frame...They should make money for selling the frame, I see no reason to pay a monthly fee to get my pic downloaded to the frame. do you pay to OPhoto, yahoo, clubPhoto etc' to store your pictures? didn't think so, it is not that hard to make this frame download pictures from such a site instead of Ceiva network.This is a short living product. mark my words."
5,Perfect for everyone,"I had seen one of these on a freinds desk, and she raved about it. I thought the prices were high, until I saw a refurbished unit on ebay, so I gaave it a shot.Man is this thing neat. I liked it so much I bought two more for my parents and Inlaws, and they love it too.They get daily updates of the grandkids each morning, and order prints directly online of the shots they like.Limited computer skills are needed to set up initially, and none there afterI would definatily recomend this for anyone with extended distance families."
4,Ceiva --The Bunny that Keeps Charging,"I purchased a Ceiva about a year ago, and it works very very well. However! And this is a WARNING: After the mandatory three-month ""subscription,"" which one has to buy in order to purchase the product, they kept charging the monthly fee to my credit-card account -- even though I signed up for three months only (the minimum), and also told them to cancel, and also had my credit card company ""charge back"" the improper charges. Despite all that history -- they have attempted to sneak through ANOTHER unauthorized charge ... perhaps they hope that folks simply won't notice. (...). It is shame, because the product does work well."
1,Quite Dissappointed,"I purchased a Ceiva for my girlfriend, and was horribly disappointed when I used it. The ""springloaded"" tray creaks like a 50 cent childs toy when it opens and closes. The field of view for the frame is quite minimal. The contrast on the frame itself is poor as well. The constructioin itself is quite ""cheap"", and very lightweight. Overall i would give this product a 2 out of 10. Unfortunately I was unable to view the product before I purchased it. (The store said that since it required a subscription it would not open the box). Now I am stuck with a hoorid product that not only did i pay $150 for but now i have to pay a monthly fee to make it even remotely useful. On the good side, the channel feature is nice, but certainly not worth the money.Thanks, well for ripping me off and teaching me a lesson I guess.JasonJongalt2626@comcast.net"
1,Do not put purchased reviews on your site please.,"Well I read some reviews on your site regarding the receiver and unfortunately bought one. To my utter surprise there is no way you can put your own picutres on your own receiver,except for the company's web site which you have to pay for.So you end up being a milking cow for the company. So your reviews were not helpful at. I can't believe people like paying everymonth for something that they already purchased. I am not saying that being able to send pictures directly to the receiver is a bad thing,but not having an option seems a weird thing to do."
1,Be careful when buying Ceiva/service plan!!!,"I purchased a Ceiva when they first came out and added Lifetime service. 7 years later I learn that my ""lifetime"" service is set to expire! Lifetime is defined as the life of the physical frame or 7 years! Seriously? Only 7 years!In the meantime, TiVo has let me upgrade my first gen TiVo with Lifetime service TWICE and retain my lifetime status. That's what I call LIFETIME.They're good frames, but that is some lousy customer relations. Needless to say, I refused the monthly service and plan to purchase another frame without a service fee."
3,"Great product, until it breaks. Then kiss it good-bye!","My mother who is completely non-technical loved this product for being able to view my digital pictures. My parents were really enjoying it, when it just stopped working one day.We shipped it. A week after our tracking showed it was received, we received confirmation that they received it and that it would take THREE TO FOUR WEEKS just to assess the problem.Meanwhile,the expensive subscription to the service ticks away with no compensation for their faulty product.Customer support is the #1 downfall of this product by far!"
1,Great Idea - Bad quality,"I bought this for my Mom. Broke after warranty period, bought second one at reduced rate. Broke again due to power supply, Broke again - pictures would not download. Cieva recommended another power supply. New power supply faulty.This product is a great idea, but due to poor quality it is a MONEY PIT."
4,A Culture Translated,"Jack and Anna Kilpatrick do a wonderful job translating selected folktales of the Cherokee nation. This book is broken down into several user friendly sections and also includes a breif section on the Storytellers and biographical information on some of the contributors. The tales are very easy to read and there does not seem to be much lost in translation. There is a great selection throughout this book, including animal, humor, and historical stories. A very good read and a great educational tool. This book is an eye-opening experience into the ways and beliefs of a people who were, and are, a very important part of our American Nation."
2,Friends of Thunder,Expected more of it to be in written in the Cherokee language syllabary rather than mostly in English with individual words translated'
2,don't waste your time,This graphic novel was without a doubt the worst I've ever read. The storyline was just plain stupid. The art would be more fitting for a cartoon. And the dialogue was horrible.
1,DO NOT BUY! 250MHz only! 100Mbps only!!!,"This cable will not perform the same as its round twisted pair counter parts.It's a cool idea, but should not be labeled CAT6 since it will not perform at gigabit speeds."
5,Seems to work well for undercarpet use,"I used this to wire up my entertainment center with the rest of my network. The entertainment center sits against an exterior wall and I really didn't want to deal with trying to fish a wire through this insulation and fire blocks in that wall. Instead, I installed an ethernet jack on the opposite wall and ran this cable under the carpet.The cable is extremely thin - around twice the thickness of a credit card. I don't feel it even a little bit when I step on the cable under the carpet. It also works well for gigabit ethernet - I used a network benchmark and got over 110MB/s transfer rate between two PCs connected over this cable.The thinness of the cable has me a little concerned as to how well this cable will stand up to years of being walked on, but at least for now it's working well."
4,Useful advice on and off the course,"This short little book is full of amusing and useful advice and insight regarding the complicated and sometimes frustrating game of golf. With quips and quotes from professional golfers and celebrities who play the game, you are sure to find something in here that will make you think, and if taken to heart, will surely improve your game. A wonderful gift for the golfer in your life."
2,Big disappointment,"I bought the CD based on the previous glowing reviews. Now I know why the Walker Brothers aren't well known in the U.S. Aside from their big hit, The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, most of the rest of the songs are utterly forgettable. In My Room and the cover of Sunny aren't bad, but the melodies for the others don't even register. After a while, they all sort of blend in with each other. My advice: get one unbelievably wonderful song elsewhere and skip the rest."
4,Delightful Little Book on Pan Crilling,"Grill without grill on the stove-top with a grill pan using this and other cookbooks showcasing this flexible, and healthy way of cooking.Here are thirty simple recipes all done in the grill pan on the stove. There are appetizers here including a nice Pan-Grilled Bruschetta with Eggplant, Feta and Oregano and Char-Grilled Paneer (an Indian cheese with even recipe included here to make yourself.)For the mainer courses there's Tuna with Tea-Smoked Tomato Sauce and a delightful spicy number, Pan-Grilled Vietnamese Beef.To top it off, there is great grilled fruit including a winner: Grilled Sugar Bananas with Cinnamon, Rum and Lime Ice Cream."
3,Good deal if purchased for under $25,- Mixes better in a blender- Very fine powder- Taste is satisfactory- Good deal if purchased for under $25- Nicely supplements daily protein requirements
1,This is the worst whey isolate I've tried,"Initially this product had a great taste and mixed well with water and a spoon. I normally keep a small container on the counter and the rest of the product in the pantry. After 2 weeks in the pantry, I tried to refill my smaller container and was taken aback at the putrid smell of the product. Nothing could cover up how bad it tasted and smelled. I've never had a whey isolate spoil and the expiration date is for mid-2008. I am now stuck with 3.5 lbs of unusable powder. I will never buy this product again or any ISS product for that matter. Look elsewhere unless you can use the entirety within a couple of weeks!"
2,Overall disappointment for transcriptionists,"As an experienced medical transcriptionist, I was disappointed overall with the format. Terms were listed alphabetically, but drugs, clinical trials, instruments, equipment, surgical and diagnostic procedures, and laboratory tests were intermingled, and not divided into separate sections. While including such detailed information as name and location of a specific drug's pharmaceutical company, the source of the information described, and instructions for usual dosages of medications, i.e., swish and swallow 10 ml (100 mg/10 ml) twice, for a total dose of 200 mg, it made simple, speedy use of this text next to impossible. This book would not be one I would recommend for your transcription reference library."
5,Very Impressive!!!!!,"I highly recommend this album - every track on the album is good (which is rare these days), and the songs cover a broad range of genres - from pure 'un-plugged' acoustic to folk rock to pop-rock. Influences of Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, Pete Yorn, John Mayer, MB20 are all there, and Rozino holds his own with the best of them. I could listen to this CD all day long!"
1,"Just like the ""Stings"" to do something like this","Trudie and Stingy are hardly ""self-sufficient"" as the book description suggests. It's a euphemism for ""wealthy."" I wish *I* had a mansion and a bunch of acres to live in and grow organic food on. Then I could be as ""self-sufficient"" as these famous couple. This book is just an excuse for Sting's rich, bored housewife (or is it ""actress"" or ""philanthropist"" this week?) to display one of her ostentatious homes on a bookcover for the envy of all eyes that gaze upon it. I'd assume that the recipes contained within are as bland as Stings last two albums. (And no, this is not Stewart Copeland writing this review.) At least there isn't a picture of the Sting-peddling Jaguars and Microsoft products scattered about the country side. And by the way, aren't gas-guzzling luxury cars like Jaguars somehow contratictory to the ethos behind growing organic potatoes and Rainforest preservation?"
5,Excellent,"For $25 I thought this was a very nice paddle. I am an amateur player, I didn't want to spend too much, so I was hesitant about buying it. But after I got it, I was glad I got it. The sponge is pretty thick, and the rubber is awesome, a lot of spin!!! Which is what I expect in a paddle. So, buy this it's a very nice paddle."
4,Not Bad !!,"For the price, I bought 2 for my new table. Its a good racket for beginners and intermediate. Definitely not a competition caliber. But for a casual player like me, its not bad at all."
3,Meh... Beginner racket,"Ok, first, let's get something straight. I'm not the best ping pong player in the world. However, I am an an advanced player and this paddle sucks! You are better off with a nicer Sportcraft paddle instead. (unfortunately, the ones I'm referencing are not available on amazon) These paddles put way too much focus on control. I could always get the ball to go exactly where I was aiming, but at very low speeds and with barely any visible spin. I am an aggressive player with a ""hit the ball at them so hard and with so much spin they don't see it until it's 10 feet behind them and a couple miles to either side"" game, and this paddle did not work at all. It would not work for more finesse based players either. The total lack of spin control would ruin their game. I would recommend this paddle only for beginners that only play against beginners. And when I say beginners I mean really beginning, like within a month or two of starting playing."
2,Only good for beginners,"I'm disappointed with this racket because , its too light and just doesnt feel enough for a intermediate level player like me..This bat is suitable for beginners only."
5,Vehicle Puzzle,"My grandsons love playing with this, only the front halves of the vehicles are puzzle pieces, so they aren't frustrated by having too many pieces to try to fit in."
5,Pure joy for a 2 yr. old girl,"My 2 yr. old niece loves all kinds of transportation and is very curious about fire trucks, trains and anything that transports people or things. Her parents are so interactive when they do the puzzles with her that it becomes a very educational experience.Melissa and Doug puzzles are well made and colorful."
5,Mix N Match Puzzle,"I got this puzzle for my nephew and he loved it, he likes to mix up the puzzle pieces then straighten them out. I also puchased a similar animal puzzle by Melissa and Doug for my daughter and she loves it as well. This is a great puzzle for 2+ child."
2,Its not real leather!,"I love the look, size and storage capacity of this ottoman but Its not real leather! It is Bonded/bicast leather with a PU coating that and peels off after a couple of years. .So dissapointed :("
5,A superb book,This two volume set on the American Revolution is absolutely fantastic. One of the best presentations I have read. This book should be in verybody's library.
3,"I found the book interesting, it's all about obsession.","I found the book interesting, probably because I could see myself as the author. A desperate seeker of life and love, always coming up empty handed. It was evident that the author was obsessed with his quest. Unfortunately, he will never find what he is looking for outside of himself...it's within. I am a female Frank Spataro but I do not have the courage to put my obsessions into print. I am now on a gentle journey discovering myself and it's not always fun. Thank you Iosulo...you were a mirror.By the way, it was nice meeting you at Borders and I just got a computer."
2,"Disorganised and poorly presented, but still rich","Uyless Black is a poor writer, and you get the impression that you're reading his own study notes at times rather than the words of a master... but if nothing else, reading this series is faster than reading tens of thousands of pages of white papers. These books are rich in low level technical details, but the choice of which details to include and which to leave out frequently seems arbitrary and rarely contributes to easy reading.I'd recommend these books as a desk reference for the networking professional who isn't content to download .pdf standards and white papers from the ITU-T & the ATM Forum. Reading the series from start to finish is an unpleasant experience, but not unbearable.For the reader looking for an eloquent introduction to ATM, how it works, and what it can do, this is NOT the place to start. Keep looking."
3,wrong screws,The product msd rotor cap and button I purchased from Amazon worked great. Exept I had to take the hold down screws out of my old rotor cap and reuse them in new msd rotor cap in order for it to work right. That is the only complaint I have.
4,Good service...,"The first time I saw the item online, i feel in love with it. Although it was small but it was described as it . I love the material. Its is an add-up to my collections. Hope someday there is somewhat like this but much bigger one like double the size and of course different design....My only regret was that my first order didnt arrive, probably lost along the way.. But, thanks to the seller who really sent the replacement so I have it. Thank you so much... Over all, the item is awesome and good service too !"
4,A sad but good book,"This book tells about nine-year-old Elizabeth Barker, an English girl who has come to live in the Jamestown colony in 1609. Food is very scarce, and many people are starving. Many people die, including Elizabeth's friend and mother. But she also makes another friend, a really nice one, and her twin brother, Caleb, who was too ill to travel with Elizabeth and her parents before, finally arrives on the spring supply ship, which also has food. By the end of the book, the colony is a peaceful place to be."
5,I'm 6 and I loved it!!!,I read the book to my mom. It was interesting. I really liked it and I think alot of other peolple would too. I learned alot about Jamestown but I don't think Elizabeth had a very good childhood.
5,Ping Pong Paddle,"This paddle is an excellent racket for table tennis. It is well built and has excellent handling. Butterfly rackets are the way to go and have many different paddles geared to your skill level. For this paddle, the lowest skill level, it is cheap yet very effective. Excellent racket for beginners."
3,A racket of limited capabalities,"I have always held Butterfly rackets in high esteem. Returning to table tennis after a gap of a decade, I decided to try this paddle to relearn the game. But I found my old form pretty soon and found this racket lacking in firepower.This would be a good racket to start with if you are only just learning the ropes of table tennis. However, it falls short of expectations if you are a fairly advanced casual player. For my kind of game play (a mix of aggression and defense), it is quite hard to get good smashes or drives with this paddle. It is quite good on control though (as the manufacturers claim). Spin is not quite as good.For fast paced game play I would recommend a paddle with 2.0 mm sponge from my experience with this and other paddles."
4,Good Starter Paddle,"I agree entirely with the previous review. It is a good starter paddle but as you progress in your game, you will need a stronger paddle."
2,Beginner's racket,"This racket is only good for beginners, that is, children starting to play table tennis, and adults playing for fun. If you wish to start playing table tennis on a slightly more advanced level, then the purchase of this racket should be skipped."
4,nice leather,Beautiful. Hardware is a bit soft causing key rings to dismount. Need to use pliers to re-engage.
3,A Rambling Look at 20th Century Fiction,"Wright Morris, author of many novels (such as the brilliantly bleak Loneliness of The Long Distance Writer) and stories, gives young writers his thoughts on the writing of literary fiction. Some of the material is dated, dated to 1974 specifically, but Morris' insights seem honest and useful for contemplation. There is an amusing appendix, where Morris writes a page or two about twenty or so different great novels and their authors' styles: Stein's Three Lives, Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, etc.Overall, it's a pleasant, simple book with little practical advice for beginning writers. For fans of Morris it's a must-have."
3,Puppy not interested in short rope,"Our puppy loves to play tug with a rope and a ball, but this one is short and uninteresting for the puppy. An older dog wouldn't even have given this a second look and walked past. Picture makes it look bigger than it is."
2,rope did not last.,the rope was torn apart in a matter of hours and the ball doesn't interest either dog. I did purchase 5 items and the other 3 so far are fine.
5,One of the best,"An exceptionally exquistite book that combines both colour and black and white on such beautifully glossy pages. Steve's images always have a habit of sticking in my brain, continually exciting me wherever I go and dream. Very stylish and intelligent and not the typical ""in your face"" imagery that everyone else seems to do. Like they say, he is a master of powerful yet subtle eroticism. Both of his books will stay on my shelves and in my mind for many years to come."
5,THE book on gay male relationships!,"If there were one book to recommend on gay male relationships--This is the ONE! As a social work therapist, I recommend this book to all my gay male clients and workshop participants. Summarizes the developmental process of relationship in a non pathologizing way, while offering useful skills to meet and connect with other men! Anxiously awaiting Craigs further offerings. This one is well worth the price!"
5,A book that opened my eyes to the way I think about guys!,"If you're like me, and you've been dating around but want something more, run out and get this book immediately. It really makes you think about what you want out of life and what you want in your own personal life. I don't know of any other book on 'relationships,' for example, that talks about how great being single is. ""Finding True Love"" really made me sit down, take a look at myself, think about the lovers I've had, and put everything in perspective. Thanks, Craig!"
5,You MUST buy this book,"If you have questions that you have been mulling over in your mind, or if you find yourself clueless and need direction, this book will help you. It doesn't matter if you're currently single or currently coupled, this book provides insight and guidance in an area of our lives where we can all benefit from a little extra help. It is written simply, yet humorously. You'll find yourself recommending it to friends after you've read it (make them buy their own copy, you'll want yours around for reference)."
5,The best book ever on optical illusions,"This comprehensive book is a must for anyone who loves optical illusions. Seckel has included the classics as well as many intriguing ones I had never seen before. The book is very professionally produced, with glossy, colorful pages, and a holographic-type cover. Buy it--you won't be disappointed."
5,Tequila never tasted so good!,A fun and interesting account of gir's life growing up in the Rio Grande Valley. Viola's experiences remind me of my life in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. All her short stories have an interesting tale to tell.
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"Read this book for a Children's Literature class...it is a must-have for the older classroom from 5th to 8th grade, especially if your class is predominantly Hispanic. That being said, this is not just a book for Latinos, but a great way to springboard into a conversation about diversity with older students. On its own it is a fun and entertaining read that young and old can relate to."
5,Rich with Culture and Love,"This is the story of Sofia, a young Mexican-American girl growing up in a family rich in culture and traditions. The reader falls in love with Sofia's family and friends as they try to teach her about their customs. She does not always see the value of their traditions until she receives a scholarship to a boarding school and moves away. Leaving her home for this new place, she is met with a life much different from her own life in McAllen, Texas. She begins to realize that her family and their culture are a part of her and it warms her heart. The book is easy to read with short chapters and vivid characters. Put this one on your summer reading list for sure!"
5,Book arrived as described,"This book was for summer reading for my daughter's school. I have no idea if the content of the book was good, but it arrived just as described."
3,The remix is okay.,"The original is excellent, and it's no wonder that it was, and still is a chart topper. But the remix is really nothing special. Just download the remix off of iTunes for 99 cents, instead of buying this 2 track single."
1,ABSOLUTE TRASH,"How can this music even get airplay!? It is so annoying, unskillful, has a terrible beat, and is no better than the Spears/NSync/98 degrees denomination. I am appalled that this song actually was at the number one spot for ten weeks or whatever. If I was allowed to hold this single in my hands it would probably be discombobulated within seconds because I loathe it so much. Terrible video for this song too. Never buy this awful single."
2,Fodor in Decline,"I just returned from my third trip to Greece, where I took my new copy of Fodor's Greece. Although there is some interesting information in this book, it failed in many areas, from providing sufficient information to find places mentioned in the book, to omitting important information all together. I have traveled Europe since the 70s, always purchasing a guide book, but have never had one that was of so little help, and it is the only one I have thrown away mid trip. Many seasoned travelers agree, and recommend the Lonely Planet guide. I believe Fodor's has lost a lot since earlier days when it was much more helpful."
5,This book was a great asset in the planning of my trip.,"This is a great book that I would recommend to anyone who is or would like to go to Greece. This book helped me find everything from when to go to what to do when I got there. I'd like to say thanks to Fodor's. They made the planning of my trip so easy, it was fun!"
2,Nothing more than a manual and catalog in one.,"This book is truly for beginners looking to purchase their first digital camcorder. This book explains how to use the basic functions of a camcorder along with listings of different camcorders, editing packages, filters and other accessories. Put together your camcorder manual and a few catalogs, then you have about 90% of this book. For the other 10% of this book, you can find more information by reading Digital Moviemaking by Scott Billups. I would only recommend this book to people who are clueless to the digital world of camcorders."
2,Flushmount light,"This light is not of very high quality. It is cheaply made and way overpriced for the quality of the materials. I would have sent it back, but wanted a red light for my grandson's room and couldn't find anything else.I shop on Amazon.com alot and this is the first product that I felt was of a low quality."
1,Awful.,"It's a strong plastic toy. I would not buy it if I were you, bought it for my kid, he was bored of it the next day. So unless your child enjoys Role-Playing there is not much to this."
3,"Sure it's great, but not for my hair type","I got this product because I'd heard it would be great for dry hair. Having recently gone blonder, my hair was a little dry & damaged, so I thought this would help. It's not for my hair type (and I did not read that anywhere) -- it left it feeling very waxy & unpleasant. I have fine, relatively straight hair, so I just want to pass on that it may not be for you if you have similar hair."
1,All the electricity of a worn out battery.,This is a very disappointing book. The characters are faintly unpleasant and totally shallow. The plot is thin and does not develop. The book is neither erotic or entertaining. I for one will not be buying the sequel.
2,please read b4 buying this product,"i have ordered three other carnivorous plants on line all from different growers and its a miracle that this plant made it to me alive. it was potted in a rush, had six pitchers(two dead, two too small to trap, and two an inch and a half or smaller). the only good thing i have to say is that it was cheap, and had a beautiful shade of purple."
5,Good stuff,"Mailed to me very quickly and has lived for about a month now, anything going wrong at this point would most likely be my fault, so no problems."
3,Sporting Texas,"From the Texas point of view:Scanning HM's 2005 Travel anthology, the editor found no obvious Texas connection, but maybe he just doesn't know what he's doing. However, the Sports anthology was different. The full text selections included Michael Hall's ""The Duke of Dunbar"" and Katy Vine's ""Alive and Kicking"" both from Texas Monthly issues. In the list at the back for other notables of the previous year were three citations, including John Spong's ""The Shot Not Heard Around the World,"" (Texas Monthly), Jose de Jesus Ortiz's ""Braves Exercise Poor Judgment"" (Houston Chronicle October 10), and Paul Kix's ""All the Rage"" (Dallas Observer, August 12-18)."
5,The second studio lp (of three) from an amazing KC lineup,"""Lark's Tongues in Aspic"", ""Starless and Bible Black"", and ""Red"" are all equally superb. I've been a fan from the first album through the current lineup , it's hard to have favorites.... BUT.... these three albums are (for me) just the best of the lot. For those unfamiliar with this era of Crimson, all of these works have pretty much the same lineup (core of Wetton, Fripp, and Bruford).There is a very good reason that this era of Crimson has been given so much live documentation (legal and bootleg): there is a spine chilling dynamism that never lets up. Progressive rock would never see these heights again."
4,"this night wounds time,","This is a great album except for the opening song The Great Deceiver which is probably my least favorite song by the band with Wetton showing off the fact that he can't really sing this song that well in the studio. the live versions are the kicker. Most of this album is based on live improv with the audience removed and studio overdubs added. I really like this album and many songs have become classics for the band. The Night Watch is a beautiful song based on the famous painting. Lament starts off mellow and builds to a rocking finish. Trio is a moving instrumental. Starless and Bible Black rendered here in an instrumental version as the lyrics had not been written yet is wonderful and the same can be said for Fracture. This isn't an album I'd start my King Crimson collection off with, but once you have In The Court, Poseidon, Larks Tongues, Discipline, Perfect Pair, ect get this one too."
3,High ramblings,"3 1/2A mid-level entry in the classic-prog band's powerful output, with typically eclectic brilliance offset by some underdeveloped rough patches- symptomatic of a lot their early work but feeling even less cohesive as a whole and in individual songs here, despite much obvious microcosmic quality."
4,GREAT book should never have gone out of print,this is a great book that never should have gone out of print.I would have given it 5 stars but shipping always takes a long time
3,This book will make you think!,"This book is simply put together by the author to make you consider what you are feeding your children. he has done his homework and cares about the environment and ALL God's creatures at the same time. No matter what some people say about this being unbalanced or unhealthy if you go all the way back to the beginning of time in the Garden of Eden where God gave the ""Original"" diet for man you will see that this is the diet that Dr.Klapper advises. And you cannot improve on the Master Designers ideas no matter what you think!"
3,options,Eating healthy doesn't mean you have to cut out dairy meat or eggs but if YOU choose this for yourself then by all means do so. What i do have issue with is these parents who give no alternative to their children. The parents of these children got the option to choose how they eat. Why don't their children get the same choice. Whats right for you may not be right for your children. Having said so i also think more parents should cut out the junk food and make their children eat more fruits and veggies. All i care about is the healthy children who get to choice of if they eat a hamburger or a veggie burger.
5,very good for professional use,I'm a hairstylist and I uses them a lot I have had them for a year in a half and they're still going strong very good product and very good price
5,Great Buy!,My husband is a Barber and I just ordered these and let me just say its worth the money! We went looking all over for the pair in this color and you couldn't find any under 500$. When I bought these for him he was impressed at the quality and price. Will buy from them again!!
2,Average book,"I was looking through the reviews, and I noticed this book. I picked it up, because I normally like Amanda Ashley, but I didn't like this book. I tried to read the whole thing, because I had paid for it, but it was very difficult to keep my attention on the book. I really had no sympathy for the main female character. She acted like a spoiled brat, with no redeeming qaulities. I couldn't understand the guy's motivation for liking her. Even in the end, she acts like a pain. It is not the worst book I have ever read, hence the two stars, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,The Captive,"She's done it again. This is a fabulous futuristic/romance story. It has lots of action, lots of steamy romance, and lots of surprises in the plot. Very imaginative storyline. You will LOVE Falkon! You will want to read this one straight through. There is no putting it down once you start it!"
5,The Longfellow Translation of Inferno,"I have read and taught several different translations of Dante's Inferno, but I was not aware that Longfellow had been the first to translate it into English. Although it is not written in Terza Rima, it is a beautiful, flowing and elegant rendition of Dante the Pilgrim's descent through the nine levels of hell. I teach Inferno in college, and although my books are ordered for this semester, I intend use the Longfellow translation for the next course."
5,Longfellow's and other translations,"I'd just like to point out that notwithstanding the reviewer below, Longefellow was not the first to do an English translation of Dante. That was Rev. Henry Cary's black verse version, published 1810 (?). Readers who are looking for accuracy should check out John Singleton's prose translation with extensive commentary, but in my opinion Longfellow's version is the most satisfying overall. In only makes sense: Longfellow had the most innate talent of all Dante's English translators (at least that I've read)."
5,hell of a book lmao,"I think its comical how you gave the inferno a review like ""its a hell of a book"" lmao. You are quite the comedian."
4,Good resource for Employee relations issues,I've enjoyed this book as it has helped me in creating the right wording for documents and in helping set the right expectations with employees. I definitely think this book was worth the money.
2,Kindle Version as a reference manual,The material was useful but the format was wrong for a reference document. This book is great for triggering ideas and thoughts for performance review. I recommend buying the paper version of the book instead of the kindle version. Kindle version of books are great for reading but not so great for research.
5,Very helpful!,"There are positive, negative and goals phrases very helpful at times. I believe every manager would find some prases that apply to few scenarios at the workplace. But always check with your HR Department to make sure you are following the company's policies."
5,Awesome,Terrific book!It was easy to use and provided much relief from my review writing anxiety this year. I would recommend this book to new supervisors/managers as well as those who are more experienced. The format was outstanding and provides ideas for both positive and constructive feedback as well as action planning. I will use this book for performance conversations throughout the year. Definitely a good buy and worth every penny.
5,"excelent book, excelent seller","excelent book, easy to read and to understand.excelent seller, quick shipping and great shape."
2,Not quite what I expected,This wasn't what I expected... I was expectign more than one word examples of things to say.
3,Not a bad book.,"This book was helpful, but not as much as I'd hoped. It would be best for someone new to writing reviews."
3,Bought for new managers at the office to help them better-prepare performance reviews.,"As an good HR professional knows, it is tragic how poorly many in supervisory roles today write. (Makes me worry almost as much for the future of our country as having a Socialist Muslim in the White House!) In any case, I've given the book to several of our newer managers during coaching sessions on how to prepare a performance review, and nearly all have commented on how much the book helped them."
4,BUY THE BOOK !,"After using this book in conjunction with my anatomy and physiology for school, the information was easier to understand and helped me to pass the class. Springhouse takes a large amount of in- formation,and simplifies it. I didn't feel so overwhelmed.... Thank You Springhouse Notes...... You saved my grade.."
3,An OK Conan pastiche,"This title is perhaps one of the weakest entries in the Conan series. The book plods along at an uneven pace, and far too much time is devoted to developing secondary characters. The book, however, is not completely devoid of redeeming qualities. Carpenter's knack for characterization shows through although at the expense of the action many ""Conan readers"" are accustomed to.Carpenter wasn't the best of the Conan pastiche writers but he wasn't the worst either. He's far better than Roland Green for example. This book is ok, but a little slow and lacking in Howard-style action and swordplay."
3,pretty good but anti climactic,awesome ideasanti climacticits liek really?thats it?same as conan the valoroous
3,weak..........,"Yeah, my title states my opinion. This obviously isn't one of the better books. The summary on the back sounded cool, but it isn't that good. Better than Conan the Gladiator though. It has its moments. For example, when the ghost-kings come up from their tombs, when Conan first sneaks into the tombs, and the end is surprising. I was disappointed at how easily he killed the main villain,however. The guy starts turning into a snakeman and Conan basically throws him into the fire and stomps on him! The part where he beats up the weapons-master at the castle is pretty dumb, too. It has its good moments, but pretty weak overall. I wouldn't specifically recommend it; I only read it because I want to read every Conan book."
2,ugh!,"I loved it when I got, but the purse fell off my keychain within a week and now I have nothing."
2,Massive compatibility problems with anything but TI chipset firewire,"...and Alesis' support wasn't even close to being helpful with it. It was very very very frustrating dealing with them. They could have handled it differently. I just wanted to return it. They basically told me to screw. This thing would stop recording randomly right in the middle of a take, which as you can imagine really pissed me off. Not a great piece of equipment. Stick with M-Audio and brands of the like."
3,Not a stand alone,"For a ""teaching book"" I was surprised that there was very little instruction, mainly sheet music. This book is a good book for additional sheet music for the intermediate player, but not a teaching book. I much prefer Essential Elements."
4,Great,I bought this about a month ago. for the price its doing a very good job. so far I have been able to talk for long hours without draining the battery. I am happy that I changed the battery instead of buying a new phone.
1,Good As New Electronics isn't New,"Panasonic 2.4 GHz Gigarange Cordless phones is bubble pack, no less, only lasted 10 days before it needed to be charged. Seller blamed me, blamed my phone, swore battery was new and not expired. Told me I need to buy a new phone!!! Sullen seller got abusive when I asked for a refund and I had to go through Amazon.com to get my refund and to report abuse. To this day, seller is still sending me harassing e-mail every day. Not too professional a seller. Not too stable a person. Be ware of Good As New Electronics which are less than ""New."""
1,This battery doesn't work on my phone.,I ordered this battery and put in the right numbers in but this doesn't work on my phone. what should I do now?
2,Went to a rechargeable {un-encased} battery,"I love Panasonic phones; however, the newer cordless models are not so rigid to stick with its batteries. These are hard to find (except here). I have a new Panasonic that takes simple rechargeable batteries."
2,It didn't work,The Panasonic phone we had worked great for about 10 years. I had purchased a battery for it once. When it went dead this time I purchased this battery online. We put it in the phone for 24 hours like recommended to charge it before use and the handset got extremely hot. The battery looked like the one that was removed from the phone initially. I took the battery out and we'll purchase a new phone. I was disappointed that the battery didn't work.
2,Not Complete,This Average White Band music book didn't have both guitar parts written. Only the melody was in this book. I was hoping for a more complete book.
5,Wonderful book,"This is power packed book full of the type of information an embryo writer is looking. One of the biggest questions asked is where do I start? This book addresses that question and much more. It takes a person through the whole process, how to start, sell, and market. There are lists of potential agents, editiors, and publishers. I highly recommend this book to future and current writers. There is something here for all."
4,Mighty Rod Bender,Works well for bending 3/16 stainless steel rod. The smallest die is a little soft but works for what I need it for. Will have to replace die soon.
3,Okay for small 2D work,"Don't expect much from this bender. It works okay on flat 2 dimensional bends, but don't expect to do a coil or a tight spiral for a hook. The bender is simply not flexible enough to do any complicated work. The pivots and pins are all fixed meaning to bend you have to have a long ""tail"" on the bending ends and you cannot easily overlap to even start a coil. i tried a few different techniques and it simply will not work. Don't expect it to turn a bend at 90 degrees to the original bends in a complicated bend as the bender literally gets in the way and the dies are only about 1/2"" high, which is another reason it will not do coils.If i could move the bending bar pin to different locations, replace the fixed pin with shorter ones, drill out a few more holes for other pin locations and find taller dies, I might can make this bender work better.For the cheap price, if your work is simple like a u bolt or a big S hook, it will work fine. Just keep your expectations low."
5,Da Bomb,"What an album .. Three words James Solomon Benn .. His vocals on track 4 ""Come Happy"" are Great. The bonus DVD is also fantastic. The cinematograghy, and editing are ""flawless"""
4,Fun fusion of swing and African rythems,"This is a great CD of swing music from South Africa in the late 50s and early 60s. The energy and freshness of these songs are fantastic, and the period recordings reinforce the image of being in some little club in Capetown, listening to some tof the best bands that you've never heard."
4,Buy it for Sad Song,"Only previously included on the vinyl copies of Definitely Maybe, Sad Song has become something of a legend among Oasis fans, and as the singles tend to be readily available, was really their only 'buried gem' which so many other bands have. Until now. This CD single finally gives the masses a chance to hear one of Noel's greta acoustic pieces of songwriting. Don't Go Away is among the striongest tracks on Be Here Now, and teh other 2 songs have some merit (Cigarettes and Alcohol is always a live highlight, and Fade Away is anotehr okay rarity). Worth import price for fans"
2,Too Fat,"Two starts because it arrived on time and in good condition. I bought this because I liked the color and saw that it was for both men and women. As a woman, I don't see how any man could carry this in his back pocket. After filling all available compartments with cards, the wallet felt more stuffed than a thanksgiving turkey... It was much too bulky for my taste."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this reasonably-priced gage, but I guess you get what you pay for. This is partially my fault for assuming that you could monitor temperature AND humidity from outside the cellar (only temperature can be monitored from the remote sensor). Also, the Max Temperature reading on my unit is broken as it always reads 90+ degrees (when I know there is no way it gets above 60)."
3,When I am old.... I reserve the right to be grumpy.,"A tongue in cheek, much shortened version of ""When I am an Old Woman, I Shall Wear Purple"". While amusing, it is no classic. It is good for a chuckle or two and one or two readings, but that is about all."
4,OK for portable reference,"It's small, it's not too hard on the eyes and it covers the vocabulary. Of course, you must know enough of the language to be able to find an entry. Not appropriate for exegesis papers, but useful for ""quick"" reading."
1,Junk,When I first purchased these they were lovely. But the longer I used them the moisture from the glass sitting on them starting to make the sand come loose and it was a mess. I ended up throwing them out.
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed.Picture on coaster really not as clear as on web page, which is highly unusal for an Amazon product"
5,Very absorbent,"Being sandstone, I knew the image would not look like a glossy 4x6 but I purchased them anyway. I'm not disappointed. Very absorbent with a cork bottom to protect your furniture. I also got the angled dark walnut holder and they look great."
5,"A wonderful album to be sure, but...","I've read so many reviews claiming that this is the undisputable best Kinks album, that I was expecting it to blow me away-- but it didn't, and doesn't. It is subtle and clever and wonderful, but start to finish, both Arthur and Muswell Hillbillies are more powerful and satisfying listens. Village Green is a great pop album, but the other two are great Ray Davies albums. His lyrical and compositional genius are just a little more evident on those other two recordings. Make this the third Kinks album you buy. Or maybe fourth, after Face to Face."
5,Erika's Story--An Excellent Tool for Teachers,Erika's Story is a wonderful way to motivate students of ALL ages to learn about the Holocaust. I read this book to my 8th grade Social Studies class and asked them to imagine what it must have been like for Erika's mother to make such a painful decision. Includes stirring imagery and thought-provoking content.
4,Love this camera!!!,"Though hard to get my hands on one, I have it and love it. This camera is everything it boasts. I would definitely recommend it. The size is great, all the special effects are great. I cannot believe how beautiful and vivid the colors are in my pictures. Very easy to navigate. Great bang for the buck!!!!!"
4,Quality Pictures - Poor video,"I wasn't planning on writing a review for this, but read the reviews for the black color version of this camera. I noticed several of them saying how great the video was on this camera.Well I have used several different digital cameras over the years, and the video on this camera is not that great. It appears to be using too much compression (unless they changed the compression used since when I originally purchased this camera last year).That was the only reason I returned it then. Otherwise I would have kept it because I was very pleased with the pictures it took. It also has a very nice solid feel to the camera.Also, unlike what some others reviewed for the black version. I found the anti-shake feature to be worthless."
2,Lines everywhere,"While all the functions mentioned in the reviews previously work flawlessly, in every picture is made up of lines. I am calling Samsung and hopefully it will just need new firmware."
1,Horrible,My camera is seriously defected. It worked for the first few months but now i can only take pictures at night because the camera is seriously messed up. there's nowhere for me to take it in to get fixed because i live in canada and Samsung does not sell cameras in canada.POOR QUALITY!
4,Good Product,Just your basic flange. Works well. It is imperative to pay attention to the distance between the bolt holes. Make sure the one you order is right for your bike.
5,Solid quality and clean cutting...,"This was my first experience with freud bits and they are definitely solid. I custom made the wainscot for my dining room out of poplar using this bit - first time doing such a thing and it came out great. I ran a lot of wood through it (bosch router + bit) and it held up perfectly. The fact that the bit cuts a shape that can be interlocked saves on having to have two separate bits, a definite plus. As far as working with it, once you get the height set you are off and shaping."
4,Good book,"Well-organized, sequenced, spiraling instruction. However, there are several weaknesses in the audio CD:1) The verbal introductions on each track are superfluous and become distracting when listened to repeatedly.2) Multiple questions are presented on each track. When exercises are repeated, one's memory of the sequence of questions interferes with learning. The best ear training CD's (Bruce Arnold's, for example) have one track per question. This makes it possible to hear the questions in random order using the shuffle function on one's audio player.3) Sound levels (volume) on the tracks vary - normal levels on some tracks and soft (almost inaudible) on other tracks. Shameful production."
1,not worth the $,"I do not recommend this to absolute beginners like myself. First, the book recommends an accompanying cd/cassette sold separately on its website, which I thought was deceiving. Second, I do not have sufficient music theory background to comprehend the instruction past chapter one. Or perhaps it is just written ambiguously, I'm still trying to figure that one out."
4,Very Durable Atlas,"I purchased this atlas just prior to taking a cross country motorcycle trip. My old atlas had been falling apart over the last few years, so I wanted something that would be durable. And durable, I found! Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I never again have to purchase an atlas. The pages are laminated, making them virtually indestructable. Since my atlas is used almost exclusively outdoors while on motorcycle trips, this was a BIG positive.There is no question that the item is bulky. But if I can make room for it in my saddlebags which have VERY limited capacity, then you can trust that it is a worthwhile travel accompaniment."
5,Not A Large Scale,Amazon needs to change the title to regular scale not large scale other than that the map is great. The large scale cover is orange and clearly states large scale on it.
3,unusual,Has an interesting point of view. It seems to help children relate to this period of history. good graphics and images.
5,"Great price for a pair of tough, long-lasting jeans.","I have worn Carhartt jeans for years and years. Both for work and around the house. Jeans are tough and stand up to daily abuse encountered on the farm.Deep front pockets are long-lasting and impervious to holes and tears. I often carry all sorts of things like nuts, bolts and assorted hardware in my pockets.Wish they were made in the USA---but that sadly seems to be a thing of the past."
2,Huge problem with Tetra,"Hello,Recently, I had my UV2 quartz sleeve break and bought a new one- big surprise the part is new and won't fit old UV2 models. Okay so I will just upgrade no big problem it says the UV3 has a 1 1/2 outlet so it should be an easy replacement and work better for my pond. NOPE, the new model of the UV3 only goes up to a 1 1/4 outlet. AGAIN- It is not as advertised and does not fit 1 1/2 tubing. Yes, I can buy an adapter at the hardware store but the more adapters you have the less flow and increased chances of leaking! This thing better work amazing as it is a huge headache.Big issues with Tetra,JIM"
1,... to make a first impression,"Well, they certainly picked the wrong story to use in the free Kindle trial version. Not only was the story they picked incomplete (cut off before it ended), it wasn't very good and didn't make me want to buy the whole book to find out what happens next."
4,Good,"Nails don't break when I am using this product. But I tend to forget often. The tube is really tiny for the price - reason for the 4 stars. If you use it 3-4 times a day it gets over in no time, though the amount needed is really small."
3,Does this help my splitting nails?,"This was recommended by a dermatologist to help prevent my nails from splitting. I have not used it long enough to say that did help, but I am still hoping. My only complaint is that it does not have a pleasant smell"
5,Great product!!,"Wonderful treatment for strengthening nails, first product that I found that makes my nails stronger and not splitting. ALSO: great for cracked fingers (so painful) in the winter months. Just keep handy (small container is great for keeping in pocket, in car, wherever. Apply to cracked fingers often thru-out day and generous at night followed with finger bandaid. Heals fast."
5,Frederic Juneman is a genius!,"His first book ""Limits of Uncertainty"" is wonderful. I've read his column in Research & Development Mag for many years. The book goes beyond. He is a scientist's scientist. His speculation has enough scientific fact behind it to make it plausible. He goes way beyond modern day puesdo science. ( i.e. global warming! running out of fossil fuel! man changing the earth's ecosystem and other quack philosophies). The earth and the universe are to large to think that we ""ants"" can affect its change! Three Cheers for a free thinker who can challenge the mental midgets running the asylum!"
5,"Briliant, the most important work on the topic of greenways!","This book is my personal bible. Particularly the chapter by Jack Ahern. Fine work, congrats Jack."
5,Absolutely Adorable!!!,"I got this for my daughter when she was a newborn. She is now 10 months old, and she still loves it. Now that she can sit up, if she wakes up from her nap early, she will sit and ""talk to"" the baby in the mirror until I get there. This is one of the few items that transitioned with her when we recently switched from her newborn Pooh bedding to her ""big girl"" Lullabye Bird bedding. It really keeps her content in her crib for those times when you just can't get there the moment she wakes up. She goes through phases when she plays with the 3 animals, too. It has held up really well, looks almost new despite daily use. We have never had the ribbons come untied from the crib. All in all, this was a super cute and much used crib toy. And thank god it doesn't take batteries or make noise. Adorable and fun to play with! Buy it!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this movie after we read the original book by Kipling. What a horrible disappointment.I don't know why Hollywood feels the need to ""rewrite"" a classic. Kipling is a proven author and they can do nothing to improve the story line! In fact they ruined it! Don't waste your time or money!"
5,"""Fantastic"" Capains Courageous","What a great gift the DVD's and the books made to our two grandsons (age 8 & 9). The movies were shared with their parents & siblings. The books are being read as ""bedtime stories"" now and enjoyed by all.A very appropriate selection for school age children...and children of all ages!"
1,Pure Crap - bring back the original.,The original movie (available on VHS I believe) is MUCH better than this remake.The original shows how a pain in the backside kid gets 'straightened out' by fisherman who save his life in the 1930's (the sailing scenes are increadible)..The remake is an aboniation - a ship full of touchy feely sweet and kind sailers that nurture the brat in to a more acceptable social frame of mind. BS!The producers of this monstrosity should be shot. See the original if you want to see a good flick!Eric R. Luna
2,Where's the Original????,"I fail to understand how a 1996 remake of this movie can be on DVD before the original. I have never seen the remake, and will likely never. A remake, no matter how good, can only taint Spencer Tracey's performance.Release the ORIGINAL verison! Please."
1,Subtitles or SDH on DVD's of english tv detectives,Why is it that all the early episodes on DVD of Midsomer Murders and all episodes of Inspector Morse are not SDH for hearing impared. I thought all new DVD's sold in USA had to be SDH for Hearing Impaired. Hey England and Acorn Video get with the program! SDH your DVD's.
4,The Tradition Continues,Where GDW and others no longer are SJG keeps the flame burning. For those who want this RPG system to grow and live this is a must have.
2,Not overly useful,"As a big fan of Traveller, I was eager to see how Loren Wiseman would adapt the game for GURPS. While I suppose GURPS Traveller is a necessary book to introduce Traveller to GURPS, the book certainly isn't very meaty and doesn't have much in it that you couldn't just glean from purchasing the GURPS main rulebook. The character archtypes are a must but beyond that, they could have distributed the material among GURPS other sourcebooks. I would have rather scene a more detailed history section, akin to those I've come to expect from my Traveller products."
1,Don't like this one bit,"This product contains what look like coarse ground black pepper or some type of ground up seeds. I can't determine which of the ingredients this is. Anyway, after rinsing the conditioner out of my hair, I still have those ground seeds in my hair. I go to the vanity to comb out my hair and the ground seeds fall out and get in the sink and on everything near. It's a day later and I am still combing out ground seeds."
3,Sticky,"This product seems to work when I use it once a week. My hair doesn't break, no split ends, and it seems shiny when I style it. BUT I had to take off one star because when I use it, my hair seems sticky so when it's dry and I run my fingers through, there's a film of stuff on my hands. I'm wondering if it's not meant for my hair type? I have thick, coarse, wavy Asian hair, which is unusual for Asian hair, so I might need something else. I will keep using it and see what happens. Also one star off for the shipping costing as much as the product. What's up with that???"
3,Don't know enough yet,I ordered this after seeing it on some hair care forums.It didn't stop my breakage completely but it has slowed down.I purchased some no name brand repair packet in the beauty supply store and it stopped my breakage completely so I will use that and this to control my breakage.It did leave my hair silky though.
5,Amazing product,"when i first started using this product my hair was going through breakage, it totally disappeared with CPR, it made my hair strong and full of life, this is really effective, i recommend people to use it monthly though, cause it can leave you hair greasy as it is a deep treatment. Anytime you need to streghten your hair, use this, its great!"
1,Eh,"My hair hasn't changed at all with this treatment, I also dislike the herb flakes that get stuck in my hair. Smells good but wouldn't recommend this product. 2 products that I love right now are the Pantene Pro-V medium-thick intensive restoration treatment and Neutrogena triple moisture deep recovery mask. They make my hair super soft and glossy."
1,poor quality dvd,Unfortunately the DVD was of very bad quality. No subtitles available and after 15 minutes the whole movie stopped. Within the very short time we were able to enjoy the movie the dvd stopped itself.
2,don't know,I'm very interested in reading I really don't know if I would purchase this book or any of them as this is the same review for all the herotica books( What's Up with that?)
2,"A brilliant mind, a so-so read","David Mangum taught me philosophy in 1984 in Raymond, MS, some 11 years after this novel was published. He was a brilliant, generous, humorous and kind soul, though somewhat troubled. This latter characteristic reveals itself in The Fargus Technique, an interetsing novel by the young Mangum, but ultimately an unsatisfying one. Much better was his unpublished ""May Days"", in the following year (1974). I lost touch with David about 10 years ago, and would love to find out how to contact him. If anyone has information, please get in touch."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews from owners of dogs that suffer from chronic ear infections. My 2 year old English Bulldog has the same problem. The regular washes from the vet didn't seem to do much, so we tried this.Something in the ingredients really irritates my dog. For an hour or two after flushing his ears out, he shakes his head often. Not something he does with the regular rinses. Clearly it's irritating him, and after noticing the sticky texture on my fingers from the product, I can kind of see why.I don't know if this product does anything that other washes won't do, aside from annoy him. He is still having problems, so I wouldn't recommend using this stuff unless your vet tells you to.On the bright side, we do use the same brand of wipes for his wrinkles and they do a nice job of cleaning them out."
4,works for my Labrador retirever,"One of my dogs has been getting swimmer's ear on and off for the last year. I normally train my labs 5 days a week and do a lot of water work year around, Texas weather permitting. This stuff is the best thing I have found so far for dealing with my dog's ear problems."
4,MalActeic Ultra is Better,"Wish I had know that there was an ULTRA product - has topical steroid + malAcetic, better for inflammatory ears."
5,Malacetic Otic,"This product is great for dogs with ear infections, though the dog might not be thrilled by the treatment."
4,Child of Mine,"I bought this book because I work with families who are struggling to parent their children effectively. I needed information to assist their parenting skills. This book had the most comprehensive collection of data, including lactose intolerance that I have found. It is easy for me to understand and therefore will help me with my work journeying with these parents."
4,Feeding with Love and Good Sense,"This book is great for parents of infants through preschoolers. It combines information on feeding dynamics, parenting, nutrition, developmental stages of eating and children's behavior. I purchased it to gain more information on feeding as a professional (occupational therapist) and have now started buying it as part of baby gifts. I wish I had it when my kids were babies."
3,Some good some bad,"Lots of good advice about feeding backed up by research. However, advice about being careful about breastfeeding after 1 year seems baseless and contradicts her other basic premise that kids are good at figuring out what they need. Her advice about using cry it out sleep training methods is BAD and research seems to show that those methods increase child stress."
4,"A good, helpful read for first time parents","Our pediatrician recommended this book, and it set my mind at ease in many ways. Although we have not incorporated all of the concepts, it has helped us to avoid early pitfalls. I would recommend it."
1,not so great as it seems,"When I first started to read this book, I thought it was great; however as I kept reading I realized that this book is written for middle and upper income white Americans with somewhat authoritative advice for parenting. This book contained very little information about nutrition itself and offered lots of advice about how to feed your child and many other topics (e.g. how to get your child sleep through the night) which I found irrelevant. This book definitely suggests one approach fits all technique and sends a strong disapproving message to parents who might not follow the author's desired way. If you are a parent in favor of detachment parenting style, authoritative discipline, cry-it-out, eat processed foods and not breastfeeding, then this book is definitely for you. Otherwise, there are many other better books out there."
2,Book is too big to have such a huge troublesooting gap,"Book seems fine if you read it before your babe is 6 months. But most people looking for ""how to feed your child"" books are probably looking because things are not going so smoothly.This book merely repeats (and repeats and repeats) a single recipe on how to get kids to eat but neither considers the possibility that maybe the reader is starting late nor offers solutions to problems that may come up along the way.We introduced food very slowly to our son following our doctor's lead due to food allergies, and in the process failed to introduced a variety of textures. Now that he's 1, the book basically tells us we ""missed the boat"" on introducing textures and lumps, but not even hints at what to do now. Very very frustrating. This book would be far better if its current contents were summarized and a troubleshooting section was added"
4,A must for Worry-wort parents,"If you tend to stress yourself about every morsel your child does and does not put into his/her mouth, you need this book. If you're agonizing over the breat vs. battle thing and you can't handle another bit of helpful advice from a well-meaning friend or family member, you need this book.Relax, set a good example by eating healthfully yourself, and follow Satter's golden rule and both you and your baby wiil be happier for it."
5,Changed my thinking on how to feed my baby,"This book was recommended by my daughter's pediatrician after I started to worry about her gaining enough weight as she was born extremely premature. It is full of useful, practical advice and common sense on how to encourage good feeding habits in your children. I found this particularly useful as I don't want to pass my own bad feeding habits onto my kids. Only after reading this book did I realise how important feeding is as I was originally only concerned about what I fed my baby and not how I fed her.She is thriving and enjoying learning to eat by herself and we are much happier and more relaxed parents now that we are following Ellen Satter's simple advice for feeding children.All new parents should read this book."
2,Breastfeeding Moms Should Know,"It alarmed me that this book puts the weaning information in the 6 to 12 months section. Doesn't the author know that the AAP recommends breastfeeding for at least a year, and that the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for two years,with no recommended weaning age? I wonder if the author simply ignored that information and included her own opinions about how long a child should nurse instead of actual facts."
2,Too Long,I did not like this book. Someone with an infant cannot find time to sit down and read a novel. We need something short and to the point. I was very disappointed in this book.
2,child of mine,although this book had lots of information i needed more direction and actual meal ideas to get started.
1,Awful,"I got this book because I heard such positive things about it. While there is some good developmental information (that can be found elsewhere) this book was a waste of time and money unless you follow the standard American diet. As a vegan nursing mother, I found it totally offensive.DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN and committed to remaining so.I also found the way she talked about children to be offensive as well."
2,it's ok,"there're some useful information , esp. psychological ones. However, i don't like this book myself."
1,I wish I could get my money back for this book!,"In the first few pages of this book, Fry keeps repeating things like ""I'm a famous rich author, but please be aware that MOST people will NEVER make it in the writing business."" I put her book down and never picked it up again. I wish I could get my money back for it. I am an author and was looking for some marketing ideas for my book and I don't need to hear discouraging words like that. And the bragging! Get over yourself, Fry! You're not as great as you think you are."
4,Patricia Fry Offers An Indispensable Guide For Authors,"Navigating the entire self-publishing process is a time consuming endeavor. As an author you'll continue to ""pay tuition"" along the way in the form of misspent time and money unless you get help from those who have ""been there and done that."" That's why The Right Way to Write, Publish and Sell Your Book is an indispensable guide to shine a light on the pathway to publishing and selling your book. Patricia Fry, who is a seasoned author herself, offers solid, helpful tips to keep you on track in the process and more importantly, keep you from making the costly mistakes that befall most authors."
3,Pretty good,"This Portuguese-English dictionary is decent, but I often can't find words I'm looking for. Important words or phrases are in bold, which helps, but overall, this dictionary is just alright."
2,Don't waste your money,"This came along with the coursebook and it is very bare bones. For one thing, it does not provide the gender for nouns. This is a major oversight as gender is important in Portuguese and any other romance language. Get the Harper Collins Portuguese Concise Dictionary instead."
2,"Don't judge a book by it's cover - looks nice, poor function","Don't even waste your money on this machine. I bought this machine about a year ago and it's ready for the garbage. When callers call, we can hear them and they can't hear us. As for the faxing/copying function, it now just prints out blank pages, even though the ink film is fairly new. When trying to fax, it always jammed if there was more than one page needing to be transmitted. Also, the ink film doesn't last very long. The only nice thing about this fax machine is the look and the cordless phone w/ caller id. I contacted Panasonic by phone and the recordings kept giving me different phone numbers to call. I emailed them my problem, haven't heard from them. I'm definitely not purchasing Panasonic again."
2,Only good for ultra-light duty,"Form factor is very attractive and the phone and answering machine work well, but the fax machine is not good at all. Copies are quite weak, and faxing more than one page guarantees a misfeed. You really have to feed one page at a time to successfully send a multi-page fax.If you only fax once in a blue moon but want a home fax, consider this system. If your usage pattern is heavier, keep looking."
1,This is a HORRIBLE product - do NOT buy!,The battery on the handset died within months and a replacement is at least $40! The ink in the copier/fax smudges everywhere and ran out after 6 months of very little use. Replacement is another $20. The navigation on the phone menu was designed by a dyslexic third grader and the reception is terrible. Nuff said!
1,picture is not the offered item,"the picture shown has no relevance to the item offered and I can find no data on how long on average the film will last before it has to be replaced. Inexpensive machine, expensive ink required to make it work"
2,You have to baby-sit this machine,"I agree with other reviewers that this machine's ink is very expensive. I will also add that I have owned this machine for close to three years and use infrequently in my home. However, when I do have to use you must baby-sit and manually feed the fax trasmission making sure the machine faxes correctly. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I still like the smaller size for my home office which has little storage space."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations from this book, based on the positive reviews here. Instead, the book turned out to be a strenuous regurgitation of all things that are well-known and understood about the bubbles. There is also a bit of false advertising, since the book claims to talk about bubbles in general, but instead dwells heavily on the "".com"" bubble. The attempts to draw parallels between previous bubbles (such as a RailRoad bubble) and the "".com"" frenzy are weak and unconvincing. The author fails to point out substantial differences between different types of bubbles such as a stock market and the real estate. The only valuable information are comments on hystorical bubbles of the past."
3,Also-ran,"I found this book did not offer much new insight into the area of bubbles and busts beyond what is already out there. I found John Kenneth Galbraith's ""A Short History of Financial Euphoria"" to be much more readable and easy to grasp."
2,didn't cool the wine off,to a proper temperature in 5 minutes as it said. it would be better used to keep pre-chilled wine a little cool for 5 minutes maybe.
1,Disappointed,I have owned the same item for several years with no problems. These I ordered and gave as a gift and was embarrassed when they were used and both had small holes in them and leaked all over.
4,Lots of family fun!,"We love this game! It's perfect for a family! It allows each player to choose their level so even if you have different ages that want to play, you can adust it to be fair. And you don't have to know every last thing about Jurasic Park to play, but dinosaur knowledge is a great help!"
4,Very quick to read,"This was a required text for a graduate course. We had to read almost the whole book and before I ever opened it, I was intimidated by having to cover so many chapters, but this book is laid out very well and each chapter is written by someone different. I found it very informative and easy to read. One of the better ABA texts I've had to use."
2,I can't believe I actually finished it,"This book is hard to read, ridiculously overcomplicated, and even contradictory at times. There are several glaring mistakes in the editing. However, it does provide a somewhat biased, skewed to NCLB, view of ""effective teaching methods"" if you can interpret it. Not for the faint of heart. Best for those with a real need for an ABA perspective and significant knowledge of Special Education."
1,Stinky Soap - NOT the Original Ivory,"It's my own fault that I ended up with a two year supply of stinky soap that I could get at any local store. I read other reviews that claimed the soap they got was the original unscented Ivory. Maybe those folks did get the real thing, but that't not what I got. Why on earth did P&G ever do this to their old standard? I'm stuck with this garbage now, but when it's gone, I'll not buy another bar of Ivory until they once again offer unscented."
4,Good value if you use a lot of soap!,"It's getting harder and harder to find pure unscented soap at the store, and this is a good value for the amount of soap you get in the package. I won't need to buy soap for a year! Just be sure you have a place to store it all."
1,They've changed it,"Some time in the last couple of months they've changed the Ivory formula. It used to be unscented, or nearly so, and now it is scented almost as strongly as most other soaps. I've thrown out all the package bars I recently purchased. Oh well, now I'll have to switch to a higher priced ""natural"" like Tom's or Kiss My Face."
1,not the original soap,"This is not the original unscented ivory. They claim it is the original ivory soap, yet they replaced it with a scented soap. I will never buy from ivory again. I'm glad this happened because while researching I found out they test on animals and now I know I will never buy from them again."
1,Needs to be cheaper.,"Up until recently you could get this package of 12 - 4.5oz Bath size Ivory Soap Bars for $2.97 (plus 5% tax) at Walmart. Now, I think they raised the price up to $3.76 (plus 5% tax).$3.76 * 3 = $11.28 (plus 5% tax) = $11.84$11.84 < $14.99 (regular order) or $12.74 (automatic reorders)UPDATED: This is ridiculous!!! The price of the product went down to $9.99 for 3 12-packs, but the shipping cost, $13.63, is more than the product!!!! Change it to free shipping then I would buy it!"
2,Genderless Recall,"I gave two stars because it has been two years since I listened to the cds and I still recall many of the hints and vocabulary I learned using the system, however, I deducted 3 stars for failing to teach whether the nouns are masculine or feminine. There is a small booklet which accompanies the cd's but it does not provide gender either. If you are studying on your own and digesting a lot of grammar through books, these cd's make a welcome change of pace and seem to cover the basics."
3,"Good, but leaves you wanting more.","This is a pretty good deal: You learn Spanish words by picturing them in funny little scenarios in your head. It does work, but there are not really that many words. Also, if you plan to use it in your car, or in a situation where you can't read the words as you go, you should have a good understanding of Spanish pronunciation.By the end, you won't be able to understand Spanish as much as have a chance of figuring out what someone is saying by cherry picking words. So don't think this at all a course to get you speaking Spanish as much as it is a course that is a primer or a supplement to your current studies.It would be great if there were more words, but with some thought you should be able to come up some helpful memory joggers on your own.I gave it three stars because I just don't think the length justifies the price. But, you WILL learn the words presented in about 10 seconds per word."
5,Very helpful....,This is a great way to learn Spanish words. It doesn't do much in the form of sentences or conversations - however - if you are looking to just learn the VERY basics - this is a fun and effective way of doing it. Some of the recall methods are rather humerous.......
2,"Extremely basic vocabulary, a bit silly","The idea behind these CDs is good: to make up silly mnemonic devices to help you associate Spanish words with their meanings. The limitations are that it includes very few words and many of them are cognates, so you really don't need to waste time finding a way to remember that ""color"" in Spanish means ""color"" in English, for example. You also don't learn if the words are masculine or feminine, which is a big drawback. Some of the mnemonics were clever and did help me fix the Spanish words in my mind, but most of the CDs were silly and not worth the time."
5,Spanish Vocabulary,I love this cd. It is very helpful while traveling and it's fun. I like the helpful hints that this cd gives to learn the language.
3,Magic gone like Biba's gone,"I, too, was there in the late '60s, living and working in London with Biba just across the street beckoning daily. The text in this book is informative and interesting to anyone who has done retail or wants to know about its vagaries, and the photos are superb. But it is one person's collection, and for me, the visual essence and excitement of Biba is missing. Maybe it's the fact that there are no customers with their enthusiasm, or maybe I'm just missing the amazing array of color and design that hit you at each entry into Biba's, which the book does not really capture."
5,"Come for the movie, stay for the music","This movie deserves some recognition. It's a great film that mixes music and story in a lyrical, interesting and compelling way. Although it's not a suspense movie, the characters are strong enough and sympathetic enough that you truly want to know what's going to happen.The best part of this movie is the mixing of the music into the context of the movie. It's really interesting how rap is used in a narrative, lyrical and musical way to add depth and body and interest to both the story of the film and the characters.Well done, I look forward to seeing more movies like this."
2,disappointingly reduced size artwork,"I remember enjoying DNAgents when it was coming out as a(monthly?) comic. So, I thought I'd enjoy the compilation book.I was wrong.The book is a bit bigger than an ordinary paperback, reducingthe artwork significantly. Also, the color covers are lost.I'm a big fan of Mark Evanier's work ... but I can't recommendthis book. Check out ""Fanboy"" instead, or any of hisPOV books."
3,A Loveable Novel,"Though this book is definitly not a best seller nor a classic work, if you are looking for a nice, easy, romantic read, this is your book. It has a certain charm to it, and the main character Janey, despite her faults is lovable. The plot is not exhilariating, and rather commonplace, but sometimes knowing what is going to happen in a novel like this makes the story all the more interesting."
4,My Prespectives Of Casio's Baby G Watch,"It is a very satisfying yet contaversial watch. I like the color very much, but I think it has one unsatisfactory feature: I prefer the kind with the scratch-proof protectors. it is very hard to read with scratches here and there."
2,Only For The Diehard Fan,"For my tastes, there isn't enough here to warrant many repeat listenings. I like King Crimson and prefer the later versions of this ever-changing alumnus to this mix of performers. I do like Pictures of a City very much and wish it had landed on the first album. For the people reading this who are unfamiliar with King Crimson, please invest in their first album In The Court of The Crimson King if you are looking for some vintage Crimson. I would skip everything after that until Lark's Tongue in Aspic when KC really found their true vibe through a solid new membership of talented players. This disc just doesn't do it for me. - Ciao"
2,Terrible follow up to the Poseidon Adventure,"So the second coming of the Poseidon Adventure is just an audio soundtrack? So the listener is supposed to discern what is going on by listening to this music? This is just a bunch of guys drunk in a garage jamming, and they do not even do that good. A guy, he like pics his guitar here and there like he is just goofing around. So how am I supposed to visualize Nicolas Cage saving people from a sinking ship by listening to this? Nuts!"
3,It's still abridged.,"Like the previous ""remastered"" version, the title song still clocks in at an abridged 7:56, not 8:26 as on the original LP. So we still don't have a definitive edition."
4,You need to listen to the second half,"Anyone who loves this album, as I do, need to buy ""McDonald & Giles,"" the album Ian McDonald and Michael Giles recorded during this time. This will provide a much needed insight into what could have been. The ""Birdman Suite"" on McDonald and Giles was a work in progress as far back as 1968 and was a candidate for the next Crimson record while they were on tour in 1969. Then, McDonald and Giles quit, taking ""Birdman"" with them along with several other excellent songs such as ""Flight of the Ibis"" which was the ORIGINAL ""Cadence & Cascade"" and it is FAR superior. As a matter of fact, ALL the material on McDonald and Giles is excellent and in the hands of the original Crimson would have made ""Poseidon"" a devastating album. But...that's the way it goes!"
3,Lief Erickson and Randy Moss would be proud,"Musically, Versus the World is your standard death metal album, always heavy with furious, growling vocals. What makes it unique is the bands inclusion of Viking mythology stories. Lyrically, the stories are a little repetitive, as the same actions are being told in different ways. Also, the lyrics can be quite graphic in their descriptions, but this is death metal right?! If you're a die hard fan, be sure to check out the ""Limited Edition"" with 14 bonus tracks."
5,KMSU Radio DJ (Here There Be Dragons),"I've only recently gotten the promotional CD, and quite frankly I've never heard anything else by Amon Amarth, but I've fallen completely in love with this album. As a matter of fact I'm playing it on the air as I type this. I plan to interview this band very soon, actually.I highly recommend Amon Amarth for anyone who loves slower, ominous death metal... Opeth for example."
5,This should be in your knitting library!,"First, and most importantly for a pattern book: the patterns work! After completing several of the delightful small projects in this book focused on mittens and socks, I am deeply impressed with the quality of the designs, the care that was put into the illustrations, especially for special stitches, and the reliability of the yarn recommendations.The book also gives a delightful overview of Estonian culture and the history of knitting in this baltic Nation. The patters are a great balance of traditional pieces and some very fanciful adaptations. This is clearly not for complete beginners in knitting, but not all the projects are highly complicated, so there is no need to shy away, either."
3,"Don't Hate, Don't Love","The most interesting part of this book is the Estonian technique section. The selection of yarns used in the projects: socks, gloves, & mittens over & over again, is escoteric to say the least. I realize this book is dated & yarns come & go but even when this book was current only the Koigo Merino was (& is) widely available. No useful information about the yarns is provided which would enable the knitter to substitute--no wpi, no Yarn Standards. The author mentions the knitting of pullovers including the cast on used but no pullover project or photo or even a description is provided. There are only a couple of dozen of color charts all of which I've seen before. If I had had this book in hand before buying, I probably would've passed it by."
1,Unresponsive,"I ordered a remote in November 2009. I tried programming it to my vehicle but it didn't work. I called the company and the tech told me that it might not be the correct remote and to return it for an exchange. I received a replacement which didn't work either. So I returned it for a refund back in February 2010. Since then after numerous calls to Keyless Remote and leaving voice mail messages since no one bothers to answer the phone nor return calls from customer service. To date, November 2010, I have heard nothing from Keyless Remote. I have wondered if they are still in business.September 1, 2011. Still no response. No refund."
3,good cd,I actually only wanted one track the great escape but I had to download the whole CD to get it that kind of sucked
5,"long time coming, like a dream come true","I had to wait a VERY long time for this to arrive (we're talking months here), but it was more than worth the wait. I once owned a vinyl copy of the EP, and rank the Attention Deficit remix of ""The Great Escape"" as one of the best dance tracks of the past decade. This enhanced CD is a real beauty however, as the mixing parts are exactly as advertised, complete and easy to extract and use. I've already created three different versions of ""The Great Escape,"" each in a more ambient mode [...] And I have to explore the parts of the other songs...."
4,Fun CD. Remix choice bad.,"I am a long time BT fan as many know. But I must say, some of these mixes on the Technology EP didnt really tickle my fancy. Anyway, I basically heard better remixes from the actually BT remix contest then those chosen for this cd. The cd however does lighten up your mood after hearing some lame remixes because of the great Somnambulist Music video and also the lovely remix files, 2 which were already released and newly released SUPERFABULOUS! That track I cannot wait to Remix!Over all, I would pick this cd up only for the music video and for superfabolous' remix files. This is my first bad review for a BT album. (From what I heard, BT did not choose any of these mixes, for it was not his choice. The label did) Much love BT!!"
2,Don't already own mixing software? DON'T buy yet!,"BT. If you aren't sure who he is, start with one of his regular CDs. If you DO know, this EP has a couple of good remixes off the Emotional Technology CD and a great bonus; the ability to 'remix' The Great Escape, Superfabulous and The Force of Gravity. There is also a video for Simply Being Loved.The down side? If you don't already own mixing software, you won't be able to do much with the included sound files. I bought this EP because I love BT's music and the possibility of remixing my own version sounded groovy. No software (even something along the lines of 'playskool's my first dj mixer') is included. Had I known, I probably would not have spent the money, as BT enjoys putting out multiple remixes, usually available on trance/house/jungle etc compilations. Go get them there."
1,Hog Wild Cone? Incredibly Disappointing Cone.,"I ordered my cone(s) because of an auction at our school. I thought they would make a great addition to our classroom's ice cream package. Little did I know that the purchase price was for ONE piece, not FOUR as so many of the pictures display in the product listing. Sorely disappointed in the product and in Amazon for allowing a product to be so poorly represented in a posting. I may have given this ZERO stars if possible."
5,Read Reflect Do,"I just had to acknowledge how much I am enjoying this book - and I rarely, so far, do reviews. I'm not very organized and Mr Crouch has identified my traits all too easily. At the same time his simple advice has sent shudders of hope and optimism about being able to get a much better grip on my life and my habits. I will keep this book close at hand and regard it as words from a mentor. A very heartfelt thanks for presenting this information."
4,Very practical!,"I have to say this book really helped me get organized! I have read a couple before and just seemed a little complicated. What I liked about this book, is how being organized can also be simple. That works for me. For an organized person these ideas may be no brainers (I was exited about the 30 day filing system. When I told my wife she said ""yeah, thats what I do at work!"") For me the ideas were very practical."
5,Getting Organized,"This book has enabled me, with a few simple steps, to become more productive and efficient in the least amount of time. Getting Organized should be a ""Top Priority"" tool in changing anyone's hectic lifestyle."
5,Great resource,"I'm generally a slow reader, but I burned through this book in no time. Great, short chapters on the different subjects related to focus, organization and prioritizing. I plan to incorporate several of the items into my work routine."
4,Good book,The ideas in the book are pretty good; they mostly are obvious but also ones we don't really think of.
3,Okay,"I am a pretty organized person anyway, just thought might pick up some more ways to do things, didn't really find anything that I didn't already know."
4,getting organized,Who can make getting organized be a lot of fun?? But the book was filled with good ideas. What else can I say?
2,Will only be helpful for a few.,"The book was NOT what I was expecting based on prior reviews. This is NOT a guide to life organizing and prioritizing but rather the author's idea of handling office incoming mail, a filing reminder system for phone calls to be made and work to be done, keeping things one needs to share with another individual in a central location, and scheduling and consolidating that sharing. For those who don't need a computer to do their job, have a memory like a sieve, or are super disorganized and don't know where to begin to start, this might be helpful, otherwise, save your money. His ideas are only practical in a low volume paperwork environment and with those who have non-technical professions. Some kind of portable, daily planner or calendar or a computer syncing PDA is much more practical."
5,Getting Organized - My Client's Love It Too!!,"When you can use a concept from a book and apply it to, in my case, almost any business environment, and your clients love it -- you're on to something. Thank you Chris!Chris knows what he's talking about here because I've yet to tell someone of it who say's ""I don't get it"". There's lots of hidden treasure in this book that is bound to allow any reader, and with my clients to ""Strategize & Organize(TM)"""
1,Not a lot of help,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody trying to set up a mailing list. This would be more appropriate in the hands of some manager who just wants a quick rundown on how e-mail works and then hire someone to set up a mailing list for him/her.Through all the pages of the text, this book didn't provide any useful information on setting up mailing lists. The author is vague and never focuses on any mailing list manager program, instead he just gives little facts on all different ones. One cannot possibly set up a mailing list from the info in this book.Often the book would raise questions and leave them unanswered. He would describe certain problems with mailing lists (i.e. malicious attacks, susceptibility to human errors), but it was up to you and a lot of web surfing to find out how to solve these problems.Not the kind of text I would expect O'Reilly to print."
4,Essential for Majordomo list administrators,"I don't know about the other MLMs described in this book, but if you must administer a Majordomo mailing list, this book is essential. You should also subscribe to the majordomo users list and the list moderator's list (if that applies to you) at GreatCircle.com too, but for having the information you need about how to set up the config files and the users etc for generating digests and so on, this book is quite useful. However, it has some shortcomings - not much information about setting up web archives, or dealing with MIME, etc. And there is nothing at all about Mailman, the other heavyweight mailing list manager. Perhaps an update is due that covers Mailman?"
3,comparison,"I purchased this book from to different vendors, received the first in 3 days, however, this company took 3 weeks. Slow service."
4,Darn close to being perfect and this in the 9th season! McGarrett gets kidnapped by Wo Fat!,"In the 12 seasons of the great Hawai'iFive-0 Series (all told even though the12th season is almost universally loath-ed by most of us Hawai'i Five-0 fanatics),this Series, the longest running Police Det.Drama in T.V. history, had a lot of memor-able episodes. Wo Fat is a beloved, thoughdeadly chap, a red chinese agent who was inthe very first pilot of Hawai'i Five-0, Sept.1968 and in the last average episode, 'Woe ToWo Fat'. The Nine Dragons two-part episode isone of what I would be calling a classic. Getthis tape while you can. DVDs are nowhere insight, despite reports from my friend Barbarain New Jersey that somebody told her they wereon DVDs at Best Buy stores in the Carolinas.Bolderdash! It's not so, Joes!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I have several of these types of pans made by Kitchen-Aid and I absolutly love them. I purchased this loaf pan because it's half the price as Kitchen-Aid. Well, you get what you pay for! This pan is so flimsy, when you pour the batter into it, the sides bow out and you get a really odd shaped whatever you're making. Also, the sides cook and the center doesn't. Or you leave it in longer and the sides burn and the center cooks. Bottom line, silicone bakeware is great, but not manufactured by this company."
1,not happy,These place holders are not heavy enough to hold the weight of a small card properly and the slit is too big - even to hold 200gsm paper securely.
4,Great magazine,"This is a great magazine for quilters. Each issue conatins several projects... a mix of both traditional and art quilts. My current issue (April/May 2011) contains an article on airbrushing fabric that I thought was really interesting. This magazine also contains news as related to the quilting world (exhibits, competition results, quilter's biographies, etc.).Before subscribing to this magazine, go to their website first. Sometimes they have bonus items they'll give you with your subscription. Even if you don't subscribe to the magazine, you can find lots of free patterns on their website."
5,Skyjacker Brake lines,"Excellent product! They really make the brakes feel much firmer more solid than the stock brake lines. Expensive, but worth it!!"
2,Yikes,"Have never seen Bing and Bob doing slapstick comedy, but if that's your cup of tea ... this one's for you! A few great songs came out of this movie, but otherwise would rather have that 1-1/2 hours back."
3,"Light-hearted, Dim-witted Fun","This film offers a bizarre opportunity to see unsophisticated humor of an innocent age meld with cutting-edge postmodernism. Crosby and Hope demonstrate that postmodernism has its roots in vaudevillian comedy! Film has plenty of what postmodernists love to call the self reflexive: mugging at camera, inside jokes, and unabashed self parody.In other words, if you appreciate the humor of The Simpsons, you will probably laugh a lot during the Road to Morocco.Silly jokes and gags come often enough that pace never lags, levity never lets up.Now that the world's roads are easier for the rest of us clowns to travel, the film does reveal America's ignorance and insularity that is hopefully becoming a thing of the past. But the silly jokes and physical comedy stand the test of time.Bonus appearance by a rather handsome young Anthony Quinn as desert chieftain / rival for the affections of Dorothy Lamour."
5,big easy reading,"This book is an easy and fun read. Whether you have been to New Orleans and experienced the fun or you plan to go and need some insight, this is a good book to read."
2,Save your money,"This book has the same, textbook style information on various fish species in Florida. Nothing special here. Color drawings of fish ok, but why not include actual color photos?Suggestion: save your money. Go on the internet and research the fish you plan on fishing for. You get much better information on fishing forums."
5,Absolutely amazingKool,Kool and the Gang has all ways been a Force in the music business. but the Force Album was the Bomb.
1,Boring,This book was a good story but the way it was written was really hard to understand and hardly worth reading.
3,jazz not swing,"The voices are fine, but with the title, ""Women Who Swing"", I expected swinging orchestral arrangements and big voices, but got more jazzy, small-group arrangements, instead. All fine, just not ""swing""."
4,It works,"At first I did not think this worked, but you have to have the battery in the charger just right for it to charge. Really not that difficult, just make sure the positive and negative match up and the light come on. works great now I took the time to understand how to use it. Extra battery that came with charger is also nice to have."
5,Catton's Trilogy on the Army of the Potomac,"Bruce Catton's Civil War is his trilogy (Mr. Lincoln's Army, Glory Road, A Stillness at Appomattox) about the Army of the Potomac. Eloquently written, gripping, a masterpiece of popular history. Scholars may frown at his style, but Catton had a feel for history that brings the reader right to the battlefield to smell the smoke, and hear the roar of the cannon. A must read for any Civil War reader. Highly recommended."
5,a great experience,"Fast delivery, Book as described, impressed with the quality.As a writer of the Civil War Bruce Catton is unmatched in my opinion."
1,Don't Expect Research Assistance,This book is definitely not a research book. It is just a novel that uses the Hately family as the focus. Definitely not what I expected.
3,Friendly view of a key man,"For those familiar and/or interested with the world of intelligence communities, the history of Russia and the stormy first half of the 20th century it certainly is worth reading. Nevertheless its seems like a book aimed to justify the behaviour of Mr. Orlov, trying the author to lure the reader to build up a favourable opinion about a man, who is one of the key elements to build the intelligence and represion machine which was later to become the KGB. Known as the man who gathered the Cambridge 5 (recognized by Mr. Philby himself) as well as ""Rotte Kapelle"", coordinated the Soviet effort in Spain during its bloody civil war, we hardly get an insight to all these but a subjective view from Orlov's own experiences and conclusions. However it still is a very good chapter of the early history of 20th century Europe and the former USSR as well as the outrageous crimes from the Stalin era."
4,as always Meron is fabulous...,"This collection of essays is fantastic. It brings together a number of issues in war crimes law, including the early origins of humanitarian intervention and community interest in human rights through the disucssion of the works of Grotius and Gentili. IT is a valuable addition to any collection of international law texts."
4,Very inciteful book. Great reference of the WWII era,"After I read the book ""Diary of Mary Berg"" I was so intrigued that I looked up some of the other books that are referenced in the ""Diary of Mary Berg"". I bought 3 more books from different authors that lived in the Warsaw Ghetto and I have been very pleased with these books because they deal more with the uprising in the ghetto then the diary does. The stories are very emotional and heartfelt. I am not Jewish but I was just as eager to learn from these books about the history of that time. I encourage everyone who may be interested to read this book or others like it to get a better understanding of what life was like in the Warsaw Ghetto during WWII."
3,Should have been the originals.,"This disc has the theme songs from various telenovelas that Angelica Maria has starred in. Unfortunately, they didn't use the original versions for the older songs; instead, she went into the studio and recorded new versions. I would have preferred the originals! There are good songs on here, but I wanted to hear the versions I was familiar with."
1,La calidad es pésima,"Pienso que es mejor buscarlo en discos de acetato.La calidad es pésima, lástima de compra."
1,Never Received This,"I love this book and wanted another copy. I have received a confusing series of emails from Amazon about it being in stock, about it being en route, about it being out of stock, about it not being sent, and now a request for a review."
1,Order size 2m Kids they sent size 2 INFANTS,"Ordered the 2m Little kids from the drop down order menu as a gift for my daughter in another state. She was very excited, but then very disappointed when she opened the box and there was size 2 INFANTS."
4,Valuable Apparition,"In this valuable book, Janet Gyatso presents two of Jigme Lingpa's songs and lenghty analysis that is well-reasoned. Her translation is very nice, but I would have enjoyed more original text and less interpretation."
4,A great mellow collection,"At first glance of this 2cd set, I thought it would contain a bunch of 70's lame tracks about lovers lost. Seems I was wrong! mind you they're not tear-jerkers at all, they are more like a nice mellow listening session.There are 2cds in this set, containing artists like The Cars,Rod Stewart , Chicago , The Bangles and more. The mix of artists are from the 70's up to 2001 so you can tell the collection isn't catered to a specific generation of listeners.Enjoy."
5,"""EL MEJOR DISCO DE SU CARRERA""","""SOLO PIENSO EN TI""Marco un cambio muy positivo para lucero,la prodiccion es excelente a cargo de el maestro Rafael perez botija(quien a trabajado con dulce,rocio durcal,jose jose y luis miguel entre otros).Las canciones son mas maduras que las de los discos anteriores a este,su voz empezo a sonar mas segura y destaca especialmente en canciones como""TU DESDEN"" Su voz es dulce pero fuerte en""QUIEN PUDIERA QUERERTE"" Amenazante pero con un toque melancolico en""YA NO"" tambien hay canciones positivas y alegres como""ELECTRICIDAD"" y ""AUTOCONTROL"" Con este disco lucero logro colocar 5 sencillos en las listas de popularidad en diferentes paises como colombia,mexico,chile, venezuela y estados unidos entre otros. ESTE DISCO ES EXCELENTE"
5,very good movie,"Love this movie...very cute. my 4 yr old daughter loves it, too. by far, one of the cutest barbie movies."
4,GREAT MESSAGE BARBIE!,We own MANY Barbie movies and this one is one of my favorites. I'm a mom of two girls (ages 10 & 8). We are at an age where they feel pressure and influence by their peers and society. Princess Charm School gives girls a message that you need to believe in yourself before others can believe in you and that you can do anything if you believe in yourself. I think this is a message all young girls should hear. Confidence is an excellent skill all young girls should have. I hope Barbie movies continue on this path.
1,More expensive than the DVD?,"You're actually better off buying the DVD, as it's somehow cheaper than the download version! Only $2, but still- streamed should be cheaper."
1,The problem with 'princess',"From reading the reviews, I understand that this movie is about a young girl trying to support her family, and the point is that every girl can be a princess. However, in the trailer, the girls in charm school learn how to pour tea and curtsy, and for every little girl that is in my life, I refuse to let them believe that those things are important to whether or not they are princesses. You don't become a princess by learning how to be demur, but by learning critical thinking and compassion. This is so reminiscent of 1950 that it makes me want to scream, and I can't believe the movie is being marketed in this fashion or promoting these ideals for little girls."
5,My 5 y/o loves this!,"My daughter owns a handful of the Barbie movies but this one by far is her favorite, definitely the best barbie movie yet!"
3,My daughter loves it,My daughter (3.5) loves this I personally can't stand it and I can take most of the kids stuff with a grain of salt. But I honestly don't think they learn anything from these so I don't see the point.
1,never received,My granddaughter loves these movies so i purchased this one that she did not own. The tracking state it made an attempt to deliver on December 13th but as of today January 5th it has not been received.
4,My 6 Year Old Loves This Movie,"My 6 year old LOVES watching movies. She has her own collection of dvds. This is one of her favorites to put in when she's bored. She sings the songs and pretends to be a character in the movie. I highly recommend this to any little girls that enjoy watching movies.The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because the 'villain' of the movie is quite mean. I worried about her character giving my daughter nightmares, but it didn't. I might worry about some other little girls though.Very cute movie!"
1,Forces you to watch previews,"Even though you bought this movie perhaps even at full retail price, they force you to watch all previews with no option whatsoever to otherwise just start the movie for your kids. That's an automatic 1 star. I'm going to have to rip and reburn the thing just to get rid of the garbage. FAIL"
4,Cute flick..my girls like it.,"My daughter's ages 3, 4, & 11 all liked this movie. It was a gift for my 3 year old's birthday. The music is bearable and even likable for an adult. Not sing-songy or too childish. The story is decent. We keep the tv time in our household to a bare minimum so we have no problems with our girls watching something for pure entertainment as long as it's age appropriate. We have no illusions that our kids will learn valuble life lessons from watching barbie movies (I realize other reviews have touched on this issue). The movie isn't violent or scary. It even has some humorous parts and lines in it that I laughed at. Easier movie to sit through than many others I can think of. I think this one ranks up with Princess and the Pauper and 12 Dancing Princesses 2 more enjoyable/bearable barbie flicks IMO)."
4,One of the better recent Barbie movies,"My daughters like all the Barbie movies, and this one is no different. It is pretty cute. The animations has greatly improved too. I'll just echo some previous reviewers; it is nice that the villianess isn't a redhead in dark green (what is that all about?), yea for no annoying talking animals, the funny sidekick is actually pretty funny, Barbie's new voice is growing on me, the story is kind of weak but enjoyable enough. Oh, and my three-year-old loves the short feature with the sisters camping, so I'm sure she'll be wanting the Christmas movie with them."
1,"Nasty female stereotypes, nasty behavior","I was horrified to have my two young daughters watch women and girls behave in the nasty, catty, cruel, undermining ways some of these characters did! Those are the LAST kinds of behavior I want modeled for my kids. One mother-daughter duo in this movie display the worst kind of bullying, mean-girl behavior. After watching this movie once, it went in our Freecycle bin; we won't be watching it again. I also agree with the poster who said the activities the girls learned in Princess Charm School were stereotypical, frivolous and stupid: hair, make-up, clothes..."
3,Just like all the others,"If you are looking for a Barbie movie that is just like every other Barbie movie, this is for you! Girlie. Girlie. Girlie. I have three daughters, so this was right up their alley."
5,Definetly a must buy for your little princess,"My girls must have watched this movie over 20 times already, they cannot get enough of it. It is their favorite movie."
5,Made my granddaughter very happy on Christmas.,I bought this for granddaughter for Christmas. What little girl doesn't love Barbie. Her mother and big brother may be tired of it soon though.
3,Kids love it,"If you are an adult, you will hate this movie. If you are a four year old girl, you will LOVE it! I can say that this is better than the other Barbie movie that we have."
1,Let the Title Serve as a Warning!,"Autism is not a disease, but a sensory/neurobiological condition that affects communication and sensory processing. The claim that autism is a disease is erroneous, plain and simple.There is a wonderful body of literature that currently exists on autism, so readers are better served by skipping this one."
2,Annoying crusade,"Ghiglieri fails at the objective job of an historian. I wish he had laid out the river journals and related writings about the first Powell expedition without injecting such an extraordinary stream of personal invective. Ghiglieri doesn't trust the reader to draw his own conclusions about Powell's character. The author instead serves up an annoying personal crusade against Powell -- and against every prominent historical writer on the topic. I nearly abandoned the book while wading through the introductory tirade, but I was glad I stuck it out. Ghiglieri deserves credit for his work to research and compile the story of the first Powell expedition from the participants' river journals. Reading the expedition members' accounts grouped into daily entries provides an intimate experience of the epic trip as it unfolded."

5,Book is excellent for intended purpose!,"This book meets its purpose masterfully! It is an excellent review of ways to collect rainwater in low income, rural areas. Africa is starving because of the increasing size of the desert. This book is an excellent remedy!"
4,Great Center Channel,"I have used the beta center for over a week now and I love the range of sound it gives me, It is a great speaker to own if you play a lot of music and movies. Very clear with no noticable distortions at high volume.I highly recomend if you have the ability to calibrate your listening positon to get the best sound out of this speaker."
1,Customer be aware OneCall - Shipping ripper,"The Infinity BEta C250 is a decent center. Buyers be aware of OneCall, they post very attractive prices for their products but be careful with the shipping costs. They will rip you with 4 times more expensive on the shipping cost. I ordered a 4 lbs product from them and they charged $20 for shipping. What a rip off! I will never buy anything from them again. Shame on Amazon to let OneCall violate the Shipping rules.One more thing bad about OneCall, they sell openned box products as new products, Buyers watch out for this matter. Most of their products are used or openned box. YOu only see it when you get the products in hands and realize it's not brand new and they make it very tough to return the product.Thanks"
3,Cute but not high in quality,I thought that if I payed 100 bucks for a clock it would be decent quality but this clock is not very high quality at all. The chime is also just a recording that sounds kind of tacky so I turned it off. This clock looks very nice though and I put it on a high shelf and it looks great there.
2,Smallest USB Flash Drive,This is the thinnist USB flash drive you can find. However the drive stopped working after 3 months. All PC's stated needed formatting but couldn't format due to write protected. This drive has no write protect switch.
1,Very Unreliable,"I was amazed at how small this thing is! It was very fast - USB 2.0 Until it stopped working, that is. After about a month the USB 2.0 functionality completed died and the drive couldn't be recognized when using USB 2.0. I RMA'd the device, got a replacement and the same thing happened to the second one after about 2-3 months. Luckily, I was able to connect it using USB 1.1 and get the data off.It's great to have a small device, but if you can't trust it, it's not worth it."
5,Ultimate. Never thought that it would be so thinner and faster.,"I bought a 1GB capacity drive. I am really amazed with the size of the drive. It is very thin and very fast.Actually I have uploaded the images of this item onto Amazon from ACP-EP's website. Looking at those images also I did not feel that this would be so small.PROS:Very small and fasterCONS:USB circuitry is open.Providing a cap to cover the USB interface circuitry would have been a nice option.After connecting to system, I have got 977 MB free space. Why don't they provide complete 1GB capacity? If system nees some memory to create indexes/FAT tables, manufacturer should provide little extra than 1GB so that customer would get complete 1GB free space. Hope my request would be considered.Anyhow, I am very happy and this drive deserves 5 stars compared to all other brands in the market."
2,Stopped working! Disposable Item!,"This item is very nice looking, small and it has a very fast transfer rate. I used it for 2 months with no problem. After that it suddenly stopped working, I lost all my info. After plugging it in it will make the ""windows usb device plugged"" sound but the light on the drive will start blinking and windows will never recognize it, it will stay trying to access and it will eventually freeze up the computer. The disk management tool on windows will not see the drive, so it is impossible to even format. Nothing, dead! The drive cost me only $[...]... it is supposed to have a 2 year warranty, but I have to cover shipping, and do the RMA paperwork crap, to boring.... I bought to of this, the other one is still working..."
3,Good Idea... But,"Great design, compact, good price, and it fits well on a key ring. It worked great for about a month and then it suddenly wasn't recognized by any computer, if anything came up it would say the device has malfunctioned. It did come with a protective case, (not unlike one that would come with a digital camera's memory card) if I had used it maybe the drive would still work but then what's the point in having such a small drive?"
5,nice album,I feel this album is incredible with classical songs of spectacular themes of the most popular soap operas in the history of latin-american productions. I give it five stars for the fascinating content of this album.
3,Decent but not amazing.,"I had a hard time getting through this book, not because it was poorly written but simply because the story seemed to lag. The characters were not as fully developed as they could have been, and the heroine was too headstrong for her own good. I hate it when a heroine foolishly puts herself in danger. However if you are looking for a frivolous easy read to fill your romance quota then this book is the match for you."
3,ok read,"not a bad read but hard to believe that a viscount would fall for a gypsy?! not been racist that is, but i really really doubt it! so it was hard to accept and in the end when he felt a slight resentment for doing so it was a real mood killer !!!!and one of his sons would one day be viscount come on half gypsy half English really hard to believe for that era !!she should of just been a peasant or sth it was really hard for me to imagine this unfolding in the victorian era plus it seemed to me he would have never married her had he not been forced so there goes the supposed love forever out the window, but i remain a staunch supporter of ms benedicts work even though she does write the males far better than the females for some reason , but still a fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,2 1/2 stars....just okay,"Usually i can get really into books and have no problem finishing them in a day or two. i couldn't seem to get into A Forbidden love which is about two star-crossed lovers of different social standings, one's a viscount, the other a gypsy. I hated everything about the book, the well-used plot, the bland characters and the only thing that saved the book from being a disaster was the ending which was a big surprise and not all predictable. If your looking for an easy read with not much substance, read this book, if you like a book with a bit more excitement, skip this."
3,Visible Sophomore Slump,"While not nearly as engaging as the first book by King, Visible Darkness is mostly about the characters. There are numerous flashbacks that finally give us more information about our main character Max Freeman and his friend, Billy Manchester. The plot line is thin, predictable and forced. However, if you enjoyed Blue Edge of Midnight, then you will want to read this very short story just to catch up on the characters and the happenings in Broward County.Again, the writing is very good and King's ability to make you a part of the surroundings is there, but this time around, that is a very small part of this story. There is an attempt to broaden the histories of the characters and to give them more depth and this is the biggest success in the book.I look forward to reading the next installment to see if the plot becomes more intricate."
3,"Not Great, but Not Bad","After Jonathon King's stellar debut with THE BLUE EDGE OF MIDNIGHT I admit I had high expectations for this book. While it is still a well-written book with a compelling cast of characters, the plot was a little too predictable.I can't give it an unqualified recommendation, but it still is a good solid read-if only the beach variety. This one won't strain your brain."
4,Darkness,"I could read one of King's books every day if I had the time. I like the swamp, the rowing, his great chartacters, his flashback memories, and the Florida scenes."
5,A Visible Darkness,"I am so excited to have discover another great author!!!!!! This was an excellent book! If you like ""Edgar Award Winners"", you will enjoy Jonathan King books. Thanks Amazon for allowing reviews. I often read what others say about a book after reading the story line. This time the great reviews were absolutely correct. I love the Max Freeman character!!!"
4,Jonathon King novels,"Jonathon King's debut novel about ex-cop Max Freeman is great. I love mysteries set in South Florida. Mr. King does a nice job introducing us to the main character Freeman. I have ordered several more books in this series and cannot wait to get back to the hot, humid, mosquito infested Everglades. Randy Wayne White, you have excellent company."
5,The second Max Freeman Book,"This one was good! I just couldn't put it down and ended up finishing it late last night. I like Max Freeman as Jonathon King portrays him. This plot was exciting and fast paced. Max is not a ""Super Hero"" just a darn good ex-cop! If you get hooked on Jonathon King, try reading his books in sequence. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Better than a computer or a book,"The PUNCTUATOR is not a book. It is an ingenious device that can be used as a teaching tool or as a handy reference. All punctuation marks are covered. It has wheels on both sides. You select the punctuation mark you want to know how to use, turn the wheel until it points to the punctuation mark and in the open space in the pointer arrow you will find an explanation of how the punctuation mark can be used. I have the 1977 version. It should be published again and made available to teachers, writers, and students. It is more convenenient and faster than a textbook or a computer. I would like to know if the author/inventor, Horace Critchlow is still alive."
2,LIVE well? They should rethink the title for this book,"Most of the info in this book is gloom and doom. It mostly details what you could DIE of. Although there is no cure, most of the fatal OIs in this book are pretty much a thing of the past. Avoid this book."
4,Good Cat6 cabling option for small spaces,"First, this cable is extremely thin. If you are looking for a Cat6 cable that you can easily ""hide"" out of the way, this is the cable for you. I am running this cable between the baseboard and hard wood floors of three rooms, and did not have to ""modify"" the baseboard in any way to slide this cable out of sight. Second, 50 ft is a pretty long Cat6 cable for $20. I am using the cable to carry AT&T; Uverse signal from our ""router"" to a TV in a distant bedroom, and the signal seems to be of high quality.The only potential issue with this cable (as has been stated in another review) is that it may be a little more fragile than your standard cable...just don't use a staple gun to hold it down. At least in my case, there is enough friction between the baseboard and the cable that it is held in place pretty solidly without damaging the cable."
5,Just what I needed,"I ordered three of these so I could run a wired connection from my office to my living room where I have my DVR, Wii, and Blu-Ray. I didn't want to run wires through the walls, etc, and the round round ethernet cables were just too bulky to go around the corners. These cables are just perfect.They are not only flat and flexible enough to go around the corners, but I like that they are white so they blend in better."
1,CHEAP CABLE,"I HAD BEEN WAITING TO SET UP MY BLU RAY PLAYER TO STREAM NETFLIX. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND 70 DOLLARS ON A WIRELESS LAN ADAPTER, it HAS TO BE A SAMSUNG PRODUCT IN ORDER FOR THE BLU RAY PLAYER TO STREAM. BUT THAT is ANOTHER STORY. ANYWAY.. I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT, IT HAD GOOD REVIEWS. I RECEIVED VERY FAST (THANKS AMAZON). because my computer is about 45'away from the blu ray and THE CABLE IS VERY THIN, TOO THIN FOR CABLE CLIPS. I DECIDED TO STAPLE THE CABLE TO THE baseboard for a snugger cleaner fit. I was about half way through, I hit the stapler and I look and see that the cable had been cut in half, I screamed in horror, a regular staple should not be able to cut a cable in half.. so I never got to use the product. This cable sucks This product probably does what it says it does..BUT DON'T USE A STAPLER>>>"
5,Good cable for putting under rugs or baseboards,"If you want to hide a cat5 cable under flooring or under baseboards this is the right product, it truly is flat and very thin. If you don't have a hiding requirement then buy the cheaper standard round cable."
4,Great option for difficult cable runs,"I have a couple of these cables connecting an upstairs computer to a basement router (via an external run that passes through windows and past rain gutters) and an internal run connecting a living room Apple TV to the same basement router. They've provided high speeds and reliable connections, which is remarkable considering that I installed one of the cables in a bundle with a power cable, speaker cable and two HDMI cables, yet there is no noticeable interference.The thin, flat profile makes it easy to do things with these cables you wouldn't consider with regular round cat5e/cat6 cable. However, note that (of course) the plugs are standard plugs and hence only slightly smaller than regular cat6 plugs. Thus, while the cable itself is capable of marvellous acts of dexterity the plug still is the limiting factor if you try to pass the cable through a small hole or similar bottleneck."
2,False advertising?,Why is this item advertised as 14K when it is actually 10k? Sounds like false advertising to me.
5,An Excellant Book,"Resolving Infertility is a great book to explain all the medical procedures, the tests (both what tests would be ran and what the results mean) the different types of infertility diagnosis and a great overall reference book. It does discuss the emotional aspects of infertility as well but not as in depth as other books. If you are look for a general reference book of what to expect medically, this is the book for you. And the best part it is written in simple language, no complex medical terms. I find myself frequently referring back to it for reference."
3,Expected more.,"As a fan of Louis Jordan and other entertainers from his era, I was looking forward to listening to this project. However, Lucky was no Louis Jordan. This offering just didn't do it for me. I don't know that much about Lucky, so maybe I had the wrong expectations. It's not unenjoyable music, I was just expecting more. Check out Tiny Bradshaw for more consistent up-tempo material."
2,Doesn't seem to be USB 2.0,According to my Toshiba laptop running Windows Vista the cable is a USB 1.1 hub and not the USB 2.0 that the factory packaging claims.
3,"Uncomfortable, cheap plastic.",This is made from really cheap plastic first of all. The thumb sticks are not very gripping. Plus the buttons and d-pad are not very good and worst of all are the small odd triggers. The last problem is the design it is pretty uncomfortable.
1,Dont Buy THIS!!!,Bought this from amazon because I needed a second controller to be signed in to xbox for testing reasons. I figured I'd go with the cheaper one since I didnt actually need it for gameplay. BIG MISTAKE!!! After 3 days of very little use.. It just wouldnt work at all. It wouldnt even light up in the center. Just died completely. AVOID THIS CONTROLLER!!
2,Unreliable for PC,"Can't speak to its relability for xbox, but its a pain for PCThe left stick seems to always want to drift. After continually going to my control panel and calibrating, the issue remains.When left alone, the input seems to slowly drift to the left. This can be corrected by keeping mild pressure on the stick, but its somewhat of an annoyance.Also when trying to press full right on the stick, the actual input goes full right, then slowly drifts back to center.This sort of erratic input could be tolerable for some games, but for racing games such as F1 2010, its simply unacceptable.I recommend saving up the extra money to buy the actual microsoft controller, which I intend to do."
4,Good Enough To Keep Me Playing,"Don't have to worry about batteries or re-charging batteries anymore. Since it's cheaper than the original ones, the material is expected to be cheap too, especially for the buttons. But if you're just going after something that will work and keep you playing then this should do. The wire is long enough but I use a USB extension cable to make it longer and reach as far as I want to."
3,it works!,"kinda sucks that it is wired, but it was a good price and it works well. and i dont have to worry about turning off the controler during every movie or tv show cuz i dont have to worry about batteries and thats nice."
1,Wrong product,"I ordered a white controller and a black one showed up. Not a huge deal, but still not what I ordered."
1,Please look elsewhere.....,"Normally, i like generic brand controllers and i have used several for the ps2 and xbox original. So, i thought that this was a good deal. I found out otherwise. :-(First, the good:The controller seemed to be well built, and it is easy to play.The bad:After playing with it for LESS THAN 3 HRS, it started to act up. Specifically, the ""xbox button"" that brings up the xbox dashboard seems to have gotten stuck inside the controller, because at random times while playing, the dashboard menu would pop up. At first it wasn't to bad because it only happened every now and then. But, it got worse. It got to the point where as soon as you closed the dashboard menu, it would come up again, which of course, made it impossible to play the game.Spend the extra $15 bucks and get a Microsoft paddle. Trust me, you won't regret it."
4,Pretty Good Controller For A Cheap Price,I've been using this controller as a PC controller and it's worked pretty well so far for all the games I play with it. If you need a PC controller or a extra Xbox 360 controller and want a cheap price pick up this.
2,Mad Catz fail,"OK, first of all this is a well built controller. Second, there are some problems(I have a problem with wired controllers). I got this for my brother so we could play co-op, and it worked... for 2 months. After that, it started sending signals to the right trigger. Continuously. After plugging both cords(yes there are actually two cords for this) and logging in and out of his profile, and restarting the Xbox, it gave the same result: continuous signals to the RT. I would stay away from this controller by all means neccessary. Go ahead and by it if you want a short term controller with weird feeling analog sticks and is hard to grip."
4,Mad Catz Xbox 360 Game Pad - White,"My grandson sent me Lego Star Wars for the PC for my birthday so that the next time we we visited, he and I could play it together. I realized very quickly that it would be no fun to play from the keyboard, so I did some research and found that the Xbox 360 game pad would work on a PC and work with this game. The Mad Catz version of the game pad came with the adapter included and at a very good price on Amazon. I checked reviews on it and found them to be generally positive, so I bought two of them for the game. The only real knock I read on the game pad was its construction, which was described as flimsy. In my evaluation, if this is flimsy, the original must be built like a tank. As for the playability, I have found it very responsive and easy to use on this game. I have not used it with anything else, but I would give it high marks overall."
1,died after a month,"After a month of usuage, the analog stick is stuck on the down position. the stick itself is neutral but whenever i move it, even just slightly, the movements on screen moves down. i checked the calibration setting on the pc and even then, it still moves down.i knew i should have spent the extra 10 bucks to buy the official microsoft pad. i felt duped after purchasing their great TE fight stick. never again madcatz (unless they're fight sticks)"
2,Controller is unreliable and short-lived,"The controller worked just fine for about 30 hours of gameplay. Then, the right stick started to stick when going full right which can make platformers impossible to play. I managed to fix that by taking bits apart and using rubbing alcohol.10 hours of play later, and the view drifts slowly. Calibrating does not fix the problem. The end result is that the view is perpetually scrolling up in games, and requires constant adjustment of the view, which is tedious when just walking around and makes games unplayable during heavy action.This product is a good example of buy cheap, buy twice. I should have spent more on a higher quality product."
4,Great Quality For The Price,"This controller is a great buy at its price. All of the buttons and the sticks work perfectly. Although, the sticks have a slightly different sensitivity than the XBOX brand controller, but it doesn't take more than a few rounds of a game to forget all about it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
3,Legend of the Gambler,"I was very pleased with the shipment, How quick my DVDS always arrive, But I was disappointed this time with the Movies being so out off order.The first Two Movies were fine Until we came to the end to of the second Movie, The Adventure Continues, and Linda Evans was about to be hung, then the movie went,To Be continued, so My husband put in the third Movie, The Legend Continues, only to find that this was a whole new Story,and at the end of this movie it also had to be continued, Then we got shorts of what was to be on the next movie, But I have no Idea what Movies, I need to get to finish these two Movies off.So can someone please advise me on the next Movies or series that I need to Purchase I would be most grateful if anyone can please Help.I would have given this Movie a 5 star if it had not been for this problem, as my husband and I were enjoying them immenselyMegan Cleary."
3,Problem with sync of Voice and Picture.,"Good movies, but first of the series, the voice was out of sync with the pictures. Seemed as though it was dubbed over."
1,A scrambled mess and no deck of cards,"None of the dvds in this package matched the titles....and the deck of card holder was empty. This was given as a gift several months ago and the receiver was slow getting this information to me. It's now too late to use Amazon's excellent return policy but that's my (and my uncle's) fault. I won't be reordering, though."
2,Elementary statistics-not,"This book was for a elementary statistics class. This book to me was not easy to use. The examples where very hard to follow and didn't make sense most of the time. The book was used for a online stats class thank god my professor provided great notes and examples, cause if I had to just depend on this books examples I would have made a BIG FAT ""F"". The author should think about making this book more user friendly."
4,Does the trick,I think it's a well written book and it simplifies concepts well enough so that you can understand them better.
1,customer service,"I ordered a text book and found out several days later it was sold out. Reordered, after three weeks it has still not been shipped. My class begins in one week. Unlikely to try ordering text books on line again!"
4,Good,"Class required book. this book is really Good, but I find it difficult to undetstand a few problems in it."
2,Not worth keeping,"I bought the book because it's required for my statistics I class.I found it lacking both breadth and depth. When a concept is confusing, there was no explanation (sometimes, the definition to the concept is confusing); there were formulas presented for a situation but not much explanation as to why. And when there was a topic there seem to be interesting, there was just a blurb and no more insights and references. I don't think it's worth keeping."
2,Don't buy if using it to better your performance on a Fly2 Dual Horse helicopter.,"I saw a video calling out this rotor to double the back propeller for my Fly2 Dual Horse helicopter. After installing it, I have not noticed better performance."
5,Unique,These earring are even prettier than their photo. They're one-of-a-kind and have recieved many compliments on them. I look forward to more unique finds from this vendor.
2,Not satisfied,"I bought these shoes (it was some month ago at amazon but different colour and price)for work at the shop because they looked comfortable and good for warm and colder temperature - yes, they are really comfortable but not breathable at all (even when it is cold or medium temperature - my foot is still wet as in sauna) and it is strange because it has DYNA sock which must be breathable. Will not buy it again."
3,Misleading a product,"I ordered this product thinking it was a UV clarifer. But it was not that but only a bulb. I will be returning the product, but it was a good price."
4,This book surprised me,"Nick Taglio has been on the ice his entire life. He loves hockey and is the best player on his team despite having had three concussions. His life seemed perfect until his fourth concussion. After the concussion, he can never play hockey again. How could Nick give up his entire life just because of a little concussion?This book surprised me, in both good and bad ways. The situation that Nick is in is greatly emphasized through both his actions and words. Readers can understand the personalities and faults of every character in this book. Some of the dialog of the characters were inappropriate and may not be suitable for young children. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a realistic-fiction book and to anyone who enjoys sports.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations"
3,Not necessarily for all teens!,"My son chose this book to read for his monthly book project for 10th grade. While it seemed interesting when he read the write up on the inside cover, the four letter swear words and the inappropriate details in the sexy scenes were hardly necessary. Not all 15 boys are comfortable with this.It's too bad more people don't speak up!"
2,"Everything they say is true, but....","I am a HUGE King Crimson fan but when I first bought ""USA"" as a kid I just didn't care for it. I bought it again, 30 years later, thinking I'm older (++), wiser (??), and may have more refined taste than a (much) younger man...but I still don't like it! The music is well played, the production is excellent, but when I buy a live album I'm looking for something different. This music doesn't add anything from the studio albums. Each song fades out so you don't pick up on the energy of the audience. The songs are virtually reproduced, note for note, from the studio albums so you're not getting a different interpretation. I don't even really like the selections that were chosen from the different albums to be put on this album so it isn't even like you get an interesting combination of songs. Bottom-line: I deleted this album from my MP3 player and traded in the CD."
4,"Within, Without","This band went straight away from it's debut recording with each successive release and ended up in the '70s on WEIGHT OF GOLD. Some really nice tunes here with distinctive styles all laid down with the sound of an analog era. Highlights include the song ""Iron Skin"" with its thick guitar/bass blend and ""Crows And Jays"" with a decidedly old school horn mix. ""Sixteen And The Sea"" has a smoky lyrical content that sends you to a time of warm water bays and even warmer doxies (what sailors called the ladies that waited at the docks).This song is a tale to be heard. Both ""Honeytree"" and ""Smile"" almost seem out of place musically. But the smooth vocals of the former and the lyrics, time changes and pop sound of ""Smile"" make both stand on their own. Not quite where this band seemed headed but a interesting island to land on is W O G."
2,Not compatable,Not clean print. smudges. doesn't get better after running for awhile. Don'tknow if this is a defective cartridge or just doesn't do the job
5,A marvelous return!,"Having all seven gems, our three heroes are on their way home to announce the heir, with seven chosen ones to guide them.Each chosen one represents a gem and together thay are the belt.The last book is a confusing and long book.There are betrayals, secrets, mysteries and hopes.All beleifs will be clashed as loved ones will be killed, and all may be lost.But this powerful and beautiful world will show its triumph as they pass the lake of tears, and it's deaths as they pass the evil city of the rats.Lief, Barda and Jasmine have many ideas on who the true heir will be.They search all areas, up in trees and down in tunnels, and also in the imperial palace.Where hope will be lost, hope may be gained in this thrilling book.This book concluded the whole series extremely well, and for once I was truly satisfied."
2,not very user friendly,i actually returned this book as it was a difficult cookbook..im a pretty seasoned cook and did not find this to my liking.
5,Wonderful relaxing soothing sounds.,I would give this CD a 10 point review if it were available.This is all I expected it to be and more.This is such a mood maker weither your sitting by yourself or with someone you love sipping wine. You can't go wrong with David but I feel he has outdone himself with this CD. I compare it to the original Mystic Moods Rainy Weekend. Well done Mr. Arkenstone.You really get the feeling your camping overnight in a rain forest.
5,Everyone should read this book,"With debates about energy at the political forefront in most countries, everybody should read this book before they open their mouth so that they know what they are talking about."
5,"Excellent On1st Amendment, and Real Murder!!","This book is about as perfect as you can get! Mainly a true story of a lawsuit against Paladin Press for publishing the book HIT MAN, it is a very entertaining read for such a gruesome subject. Sweeping through law school discussions, 1st Amendment history, and the details of the US Court System, this is a real page turner. The details of the lawsuit, the personalities, the judges, including one whose elderly father was murdered in his own driveway just a few years before this case started, are all fascinating! So for a tour through the law and the truly horrific murders of 3 completely innocent people, and even the streets of LA and Motown records, and much more, this one is tough to beat!"
2,Ok watch but I won't buy another one,I've owned this watch for approximately 4 years and the time adjustment knob just recently fell off ( I have an office job). 4 times during this period I found the watch to be off by as much as 15 minutes for no apparent reason. Fortunately this did not cause me to be late for any meetings. The watch was comfortable to wear although the jewel on the end of the adjustment knob scratched the back of my hand constantly. I still have a small callus there to prove it. Perhaps this is because I prefer wearing the watch band slightly loose? I still like the style of the watch despite the mentioned shortcomings. The longevity of the watch and comfort wearing it verse the purchase price causes me to give this watch a low rating.
5,Seiko Mens Coutura -perpetual calendar,"This is an excelllent watch, and it does what it promises to be."
4,Great Watch ! Great Buy !,The Seiko Kinetic Coutura is a great watch !It is very thoughtfully designed and has a very Suave Look to it !!Excellent watch overall !!
5,Received as a gift 5yrs+ ago.,"I've been wearing this watch daily for the past 3years but have had it over 5 years, it has held very well over the years, especially considering I do manual work.Build quality is solid and looks amazing in person even now. I wear it more like a bracelet with a little play on the wrist, where it feels natural.This watch has everything I wanted in a watch self powering, date and month. The watch is far superior to many watches costing 4 times the cost.Next watch I would like to own is a Grand Seiko."
2,Metal standup dog bowls,"Not very good. The bowls are way smaller than pictured (I CANNOT put 1 qt of water in each bowl. It only holds about 1/3 qt of water!) they are not sturdy, however tightly you screw on the bolt, it tilts from the weight of the dog eating his food, sloshes the water, and it is cumbersome to clean, since it involves unscrewing the bolt that holds the bowls together, taking the bowls out, then reinserting them and THEN tightening the screw again; and the screw itself is wedged in between the bowls so you'd have to be an alien with long fingers to actually have room to screw it tightly! It cost me almost $45.00 w/shipping and handling, and it's worth about $5!Bad product - except for little dogs with no weight behind them - but then, they don't need bowls of this type, do they. I am thoroughly disappointed and feel totally taken in, and in the future, will never purchase any items but books from Amazon!"
5,Best one I've had,"After going through several slow cookers over the last 16 or so years, this one is the best.It cooks great without burning, cleans up easily, and the timer works correctly. The quality of manufacture is A plus, and it looks good on the counter top.Walk though any Thrift or Salvation Army store and you will normally find five to ten units of the other brand of slow cookers that I previously owned sitting on their shelves.I purchased this one from Amazon over two years ago and it has performed very well."
3,Slow Cooker is a great description...,"This cooker, unlike my old Rival Crockpot that I purchased in the 70's, is definitely slow, too slow. I had a pot of pre-soaked white beans in the cooker for about 9 hours, part of the day on Medium, but the majority of the time on High, and I had to move them to the stove to finish cooking them. The temperature on High is like the Low setting of my old pot. It never got above a simmer. I haven't used the Little Cooker yet, so I can't review it. Since it's mainly for dips and not for cooking things, a very low heat would be a good thing. Hopefully that's how it will perform."
3,Would be better if crock weren't cracked!,"This seems like a great buy, and I'm hoping to try out the small bonus one soon, but my large crock has a crack in it! I'm hoping to resolve this without having to ship the whole darn package back."
4,Euro-Pro slow cooker,"I have used this slow cooker approx. 3 times now and I have no complaints about it whatsoever, other than I have forgotten to hit the ON button. Ha! I will set the temperature and the time and forget to turn it on. How dumb is that!! Otherwise, it is a great cooker. I haven't used the small cooker that came with it yet."
1,Not A Winner For Me,"Unfortunately, the Euro-pro I received was defective--the UP/Down buttons for the hour timer didn't work. I would have exchanged it for a replacement unit, but those are now unavailable for several weeks. Even though I didn't have a chance to actually see it in operation, I did notice that the lid didn't fit the crock perfectly--an unfortunate problem these days with many slow cookers it seems."
3,Good Place to Start as you Gather Information,"This piece is a great place to start as you begin to wonder if a child you love,are fostering,or know might be suffering from RAD."
5,Seiko Sport Watch,"Looking for a nice looking watch for wear daily, I found this seiko and it was just what I was looking for. Great looks, and I bought it. Has not been off my wrist since then."
4,Worth it for the B-side,"""Goodnight & Go"" has probably been Immi's most ubiquitous song in the past year, since she has performed it on nearly every media appearance she has made. If you're a fan of hers at all, you've probably got at least one copy of it already.So the real reason to buy this single is the really wonderful b-side, ""Speeding Cars."" Piano-driven and with Imogen's voice very up-front and not overly processed, it's one of the best songs to come out of her post- Frou Frou career. This is the most substantial b-side I've ever heard from her, and certainly an equal of the SPEAK FOR YOURSELF album material."
5,Most Amazing Single Ever!,"This is the first single CD I ever bought and I was never disappointed! I love Immi's radio mix of, ""Goodnight & Go,"" and her b-side, ""Speeding Cars,"" is phenomenal! I suggest everyone buy this single!"
4,Need new music?,Like the music but know that this has only three tracks. The CD case itself is a work of art.
4,REAL FLOW!,"Cormega is the nicest underground rapper about! I could have given this album 5 stars but then i would have not been able to have given ""The True Meaning"" (his previous album) the 6 it deserves. This album has a few beats i found a let down for Mega Montana, the rest of the album definately makes up for it(Pure poetry)!Big up Queensbridge, Ghostface for a wicked contribution and Dona is da realest/illest female rapper!RZA should hook up with Corie & Dona! (Digital Magic)BUY THIS AND DEFINATELY BUY THE TRUE MEANING!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"When i bought this i was hyped for a new mega cd, but it seems like hes tryin to get on some no names, he probably started a label or somethin. Anyway when i buy a mega cd i wanna hear all mega on the verses, thats why I like him, he rips the verses and the choruses. I dont wanna hear some whack girl ""Dona"" on half the songs rappin about how hard she is. The cd keeps havin the same guests so it ends up soundin more like a group cd than a mega solo cd. If the cd is all about puttin his team on, then he shoulda labeled it as a team cd instead of a straight mega cd. The song with ghostface is tight, most of the beats are tight. Track 12 dont even sound like mega is on it. Its worth a listen, but when i wanna listen to mega you know im gonna pop in that realness LP."
5,Mega did it again!!!,The Legal Husle album is on of the best releases of the year. Especially for Cormega being an indie artist the album is put together well. The collaborations are tight the music the whole nine. This album should put Cormega over the top on sales this is platinum material don't sleep on this 1.
4,Dona is the only reason this isnt a 5 star,Cormega did it again!! Each album he demonstrates skill that goes unseen by most ignored by ignorance. The only flaw is that damn wannabe whos real name is Boxy Frown who wants to be Foxy Brown. But like anything you have the power to do the right thing. By this CD its hot listen to Mega (especially him with MOP BLAZIN!!!!) Just skip ol' girl and you'll be alright.
1,SAME SH_T DIFFERENT ALBUM,"This album was a disappointment. The production is crazy, but the lyrical content is subpar. Filled with the same self-hatred of selling drugs to ""my best friends mom"" and genocidal lyrics. There is a lot more to rap about, or at least I want to hear something different. I live in the heart of Brooklyn, rap about something new for me."
3,The comeback of Cormega,Cormega's Lp is hott!!! My favorite track is Dangerous with Vybz Kartel. He is an incredible Deejay and i can't wait to hear more from him in the future.
4,good hold over till next release,"mega, - this album basically is a mixtape. Mega is only on 2 joints solo, and 2 songs hes not even on at all. The production overall is strong, and mega smashes it lyrically. He seems like hes steppin up his game, and am lookin foward to see wat he does on urban legend. The album gets 4 and not 4.5 or 5, b/c the guests hinder some of the songs. Especially the one chick that sounds like a poor mans version of foxy brown or something, any song shes on, she basically ruins. The other guests more or less are solid. The best songs are Beatiful MInd, just mega, Tony/MOntana with ghostface, and Dangerous. If you are a Mega fan this is def one to get if you have all of his other stuff. If you are just looking to get into Mega, get the other 3 albums first. I just got Testament, and thats a straight classic. Overall this album is 4/5"
2,Overrated,"(...)What I gotta say that new Cormega is dissapointing. Ok beats are OK, nothing special, but normal production from east coast sounding like from mid 90's. What I really don't like is featuring of his girl, she sounds totally terrible! Another thing: if he is so real why he put out tracks like 'Stay Up', with pop hook? Last and foremost, he's enormously overrated!!! What is he sayin' in his tracks? Nothin' new, he's flow isn't tight, he don't says ANYTHING NEW! It sound like a 7 year old record, but no way '04 thing! BEWARE!"
4,summer reading,"very good book. easy and fast read, i had trouble putting it down. interesting plot twists and the main character becomes quite a lovable underdog. i will deffinitely read more ""Lou Mason"" thrillers"
4,Book Review,"I really like this author,he is new to me as I have read only two books of his and I liked his style and characters very much."
2,Not easy to use,"I found it was not easy to use, I thought it was close to something I use to use and was excited to think I might have found it again, but was very dissappointed when I received it."
3,Not bad for the price,"Not bad for the price. I bought this for Halloween back in 2007 (except used my own beard!) and it lasted a few years after that. Always seemed to show up during parties, but I think it got lost during my most recent move. Can't really complain about it aside from the fact that the hat is kind of a flimsy ""felt"" material and sometimes falls over. Could probably use a coat of scotch-guard to stiffen it up.I would probably buy it again if I needed it just because it's el cheapo."
2,Pretty pictures is about all,"Not worth much more than that in my opinion. I feel it was a waste of my money actually. The book has some nice photo's but as far as information goes, I can learn more from 1 website than I did from this book.."
2,Wish I could get my money back!,"In a diatribe against overly safe first time parents, she calls a bathtub faucet cover ""silly"". That's irresponsible! The bathtub faucet is in the top 3 list of household items that cause a child to injure a tooth. She can't stand Whole Foods or Earth Fare yet lives in Chapel Hill! That's like a Boulderite hiking the flatirons while smoking a Camel.She does validate the common sense mothering that most of us get after the first year, but does so while dispensing a lot of garbage!"
5,Best Kept Secret -- A must read for all moms!,"Paula Spencers forthcoming and honesty in this book will have you laughing and commisurating with her. We have all been there and done that and she admits to it. We no longer have to hide in shame over our parenting choices, be proud and get your copy so you can momfidence too!"
5,Best Mom Book on the Market,"I loved this book! I think I read it in just a few days. It is a quick, easy, entertaining and oh-so-true book for Moms. I could relate to just about every chapter. I love how Paula makes the guilt ...just go away! I only wish I had gotten this before the birth of my first son (I now have 2 boys!)so that I could have had someone on my shoulder like Paula telling me I didn't need to be Super Mom - it's true - an Oreo won't kill you! Gain your Momfidence - get this book and pass it on to any Mom or Mom-To-Be that you know!"
5,A lot of fun plus great messages,"This book has many great messages - Let go and try to enjoy your kids a little, Motherhood doesn't always have to be so hard, and it's not a competition. While I disagreed with the author on some areas (like junk food and toy choices), there's a lot of enjoyment and confidence to be gained here."
4,Enjoyable read,"Momfidence was an enjoyable read if you agree with Paula's child rearing theories -- which I do. But, I can imagine that people who don't agree, like the one's that Paula calls ""Mompetition"" would find it either offensive or that Paula is just a really slacker mom.I agree with Paula's thoughts that parenting should be fun and we need to just chill out and not be so uptight about things. (If you saw my living room, you would know that I agree with that!) But, at the very beginning of the book, Paula states that being a parent is not hard. I do disagree with that. I do sweat, I do get exhausted, I do get bruises -- sometimes being a mom is very, very hard!But, the stories were pretty funny. And it made me feel like I was a pretty good mom, because Paula represents herself as such a slacker mom, that I'm thinking, ""Hey, compared to her, I rule!""It's an enjoyable book that doesn't take many brain cells to read -- which is what I need at the end of the day!"
3,costs too much,"LOL this item costs WAY TOO MUCH.Its just a thumb drive, nothing special.Why is it so much money?"
4,An enjoyable film,"This was the closing film at the 2002 Tokyo International Film Festical. Yoshimura Kanichiro, ""the wolf of Mibu"", who toils through the end of the Shogunate era armed only with his sense of justice.I have owned this movie for some time now and never tire of watching it again to pick out details of the story I had missed before. I find it has a rich mixture of sights and sounds that make it a story worth repeating. The characters are believeable and full of emotion. The action is well played. I've found it to be a keeper."
4,Interesting Meditation on the Samurai Code,"This film was recommended to me by a Chinese friend and went in with certain expectations. Boy was I ever wrong. I was expecting a latter day Kurasawa film but nothing could be further from the truth. This film contains a certain degree of action but it is a really a meditative piece on the Samurai code. We commonly view the Japanese samurai ethos as death before dishonor. In a modern twist this film turns that assumption on it's head by espousing the preciousness of self-preservation and life. ""When the Last Sword is Drawn"" is a deliberately paced film that takes it's time to explore it's themes and ambitious viewers will be greatly rewarded."
5,No question it's a keeper,"I could go on and on about the depth, subtlety, and beauty of this film.The ending is so powerful it bought tears our eyes even after seeing ita second and third time.Nothing I could write expresses it better than.....Simply Awesome!CharlesLeucadia, CA"
2,Not Worth the Time,I felt I wasted my time watching this movie. I did not enjoy it and did not get the point of the plot. I cannot recommend it.
3,Good summary,I am actively engaged in research in electromagnetics andi have to admit this the first book i have seen managingto simplify diffcult electromagnetic concepts.It is a book maybe not for the beginner but forsomebody that wants to understand concepts as Maxwell equationsand resonators.
1,2nd worst textbook I have ever encountered!,"This introductory text is strictly written for those who already possess a strong background in the field. The writing is poor (even for an engineering text), concepts are not fully expanded upon, formulas and general ""look-up"" concepts are nearly nonexistant, examples (which are few) cover only very general cases, and corresponding problems are disproportionally difficult. In many cases, examples are not worked, but instead contain the phrase, ""It is left as an exercise for the reader to complete this example."" As an analogy, imagine an example describing addition with the phrase, ""It is left as an exercise for the reader to derive integration."" A text must have the potential to be used as reference material, but because of the lack of concrete information and worked examples, this book has been robbed of that potential."
1,"Poorly written, short on examples, hard to follow","I used this text for a sophomore-level introductory electromagnetics course and found it to be very difficult to learn from. There are few quality examples, and the ones that are present are largely explained by hand-waving and ""for a solution, see the previous section"" explanations (i.e. examples aren't fully worked out - they frequently refer you to a previous derivation). This book was, overall, a horrible experience. I would recommend just about any other highly-reviewed book on electromagnetics as a replacement."
1,Such a horrible textbook,"I do not recommend this textbook for the people who are willing to learn about electromagnetics. It's kind of easy to understand overall but for someparts the author introduced weird results without explaining how and where they come from. Also sometimes they tried to explain easy things by using their own words and it turns out it makes them worse. I do not see the continuity of the points through this whole book and it's not detail at all. For some students who have taken this before, it might be good summary book but it's not recommendable textbook for the beginners! If your instructors are planning to teach the course by using of this book, please stop them..."
3,Inverted book,Just received this book and after opening the package I realized something was wrong. The cover is invert. By this I mean the first page of the book is glued to the inverted back cover. I will not return this item but it is a warning for future buyers that this book does not suffer a quality control after being bonded.
3,Not enough for the money,"I am a big fan of Ford wagons. My Dad owned two Country Squires that were very classy. While this book covers 1929 to 1950 very thoughly, it starts to skimp on information after that till it is nothing more then a few pictures and some quick notes about the models sold in a model year (from about 1975 -1991). While the models didn't change alot in those years, options/colors/interiors did. That type of information would be nice to have.I mistakely thought this was going to be a 9in x 11in book but it is just a 5in x 7 in approimately. Considering it cost $22.00, I think this is way over priced for the contents. Also it would have been nice if a 2nd edition had been printed updating the information to 2001 or somewhere around there.Overall, if you could get the book for around $10.00 it might be nice to have, but I won't pay anymore then that for it."
4,A good start,"This is a good introduction to Systema breathng. I read the book in under a day and now use it for reference. I have beed using the methods outlined in the book and am looking to further my education. This is not an advanced book by any means, but it is enough to get you started."
4,Actually very good - but...,"The book IS good - good, sound advice on breathing, without much of the mysticism usually accompanying books on qigong or pranayama. This said, I have a couple of remarks:1. The book DOES have some mystics hype - and in some points sounds like the author(s?) are trying to better sell their product by associating it with Russian Orthodox Christianism. Do we really have to buy into Mikhail Ryabko's supernatural powers of healing?2. The book is WAY too expensive - considering that it's a little longer than a hundred twenty pages, 20$ are, in my opinion, a bit too much...Nevertheless, all in all a good book, with interesting exercise that do NOT make pop up and down feeling like a silly monkey, or stand still for ages imagining you were a tree..."
2,Hmm,"I was lent this book by a friend who is a systema enthusiast. I found the ideas interesting but poorly developed and the exercises are difficult to follow. However, there was enough to pique my interest and I intend to dig up other books on the subject.One more thing - I am highly skeptical of some of the reviews for this book. The most positive reviews, some of which make miraculous claims, are written by reviewers with anglo-saxon names but who have extremely poor english and have never reviewed anything else. These reviews have clearly been added by individuals involved with the product."
2,Let Every Breath,"This book was skewed toward religious beliefs, but if you can get past that it's ok. However, I do believe what they are trying to teach in this book is a higher level idea, so people with experience in breathing techniques won't feel as overwhelmed as the beginner."
4,great product,"I love this toy! My dog is a tough chewer. He chewed up the rope part fairly quickly, but the mid section is made of some type of mesh that he hasn't chewed through yet. The squeaker in this toy isn't as obnoxious as most. It's not too loud and not too easy to squeak. I got mine on clearance at wal-mart, but I think I'll order another for a back up, just in case they decide to stop selling it."
2,swarovski star,"Nice gift for the money. However, you get what you pay for. No written evidence that it is a swarovski. If you know swarovski, it is not the same quality. Pretty piece but nothing like the real thing!"
3,A CD for those who want to remember the past,"This CD is an odd compilation from various Mexican pop singers. The songs center around the theme of summer love.Most of the performers (Sasha, Alix, Masso) were at one point members of bubble gum pop groups. The music in this CD doesn't stray from that bubblegum sound, but it does point to their later work, especially in the case of Sasha Sokol, who later released the excellent Once Once. Also present in the CD is Alejandra Guzman, once the queen of Spanish language pop-rock, before the advent of real rock singers. The aggressive attitude that made her famous is evident in her song 'Verano Peligroso.'If you grew up listening to Spanish Language bubble gum pop of groups like Timbiriche and Menudo, this CD should bring back old memories."
3,I expected something better,"This is my first Butterfly racket and to be honest, I expected something better. To start off, the handle is very thin. If you have large hands, this racket is a definite ""no"". I am entirely not sure whether the racket which was shipped to me was brand new. I could see that the rubber was not shiny in certain parts (especially along the edges) and showed definite signs of usage. I originally bought this for me, but have given it to my wife and she is happy with it! Overall, this is a decent racket but as I told earlier, if you have large hands and want a racket with more speed, please look for something else."
5,amazing!,I was able to get this racket on sale for $25 with shipping (norm. $40 w/out shipping.) Rubber extremely tacky and conducive to putting massive amounts of spin on the ball; don't believve they are manufacturing this any longer though. Wakaba rubber.
3,Good beginner competition table tennis racket.,"I believe the Seemiller table tennis racket is no longer manufactured but for $29.99, it is a good competition racket.It is well balanced and light with good inverted rubber on both sides of the racket. In good condition, it is a good performing racket. With an anatomical handle and Wakaba rubber. Good strokes resulted and many points gained with this racket. However, once you out grow it, a higher level paddle is great.The cons, it is light and easily broken. I dropped my racket (on accident of course) from waist high onto concrete and of course it chipped of good chunks of the handle. About 3 weeks later I accidentally hit the side of the table and didn't notice until after 2 weeks of agonizing errors, a tilt across the paddle face when holding it vertical resulting from the hit to the table."
5,"YOUR SO HIIIGH, YOUR so HIIIIIGH, Why can't you flllllly?","I'm a completest with the amazing BJM Catalog of masterpieces.. This is worth owning mainly becuase of the title track because its a moderately different version from the other one off of the ""Zero:Songs from Bravery, Repetition and Noise EP."" All the other songs can be found off of the full-length, ""And This Is Our Music...""If you need it go on ebay, I got mine sealed for, dig this.. $2.99 plus $1.99 shipping and handling."
3,Gave to my Brother,"Needs to state if sizes are for men and/or women. I liked this vest enough to not send back, but gave it to my brother because it was so big. If I didn't have a brother, would have been super disappointed."
5,Highly Recommend,Great read! All good as ordered. Only issue was a stain on the edge of pages otherwise the book was just as ordered. Thanks for a good experience.
4,GRIPPING,"To be honest, this book deals with a very hard, difficult, disturbing subjects. It involves incest, pedophilia, and domestic/child abuse, depressive states that lead to suicide attempts, and the list go on and on. But Mr. Yates, that have amazed me with his debut Leave Myself Behind once again proved that BOY, he can woven those words and writes something that actually readable for such dark subjects. The story grips you from the get go and you can't help sympathize with brothers despite everything. It's not a happy book but boy, the journey of finishing it, is totally worth every minutes."
1,Tedious,"Disappointing. I enjoyed his previous book, Leave Myself Behind. The Brothers Bishop is depressing. There is not much of a story. It is filled with lackluster characters. Not recommended."
3,Brothers Bishop,"I like Bart Yates' work (Leave Myself Behind is my favorite book), and I enjoyed Brothers Bishop; however, this book is rather ""dark"" and definitely (especially at the end!) is not exactly the ""feel good read of the year!"" The relationship between the two brothers is rather weird, although I suppose there are people out there who relate to it. Would all of this tragedy happen to one family all at the same time? Maybe... I give kudos for the fact that it is a novel with gay characters that goes beyond soap opera style sex scenes and frivolous happenings. I like Mr. Yates' style and it's worth reading if you like his books...but it's not ""lite"" and not my favorite of his works..."
4,wow. not perfect but wow,"I am a bit drained from the last 30 pages or so; this will stay with me for a very long time. I have to say, the chapters wee too long and the book could have flowed a bit better to make it a more natural ready; But Bart Yates did a very good job with the characters and the setting; this is worth the time to pick this up; perfect summerr read / beach read. Now I want to pick up his first novel, but do nto see it available in hardback. Enjoy this one."
3,interesting but flawed,"this book is powerfully written--just gripping. it does get at a lot of strong emotions and has a well-characterized narrator. it is also to be commended for creating a gay character who struggles powerfully with anger and violence, as an aggressor not victim. however, there is a melodramatic tone to much of it. the characters other than the narrator are less nuanced than they might be. and the book's greatest flaw: a strange assortment of subplots that don't line up particularly well with the themes of the stronger main plot."
5,Promote to Arch Bishop,"You will really like this book. Really. There is love, pathos, disturbing conduct, even great sex, all written in a beautiful, deeply personal manner. Nathan is who we likely are; Tommy is who we want to be. To a point. Author Bart Yates manages a two-fer: a compelling, engrossing story and a sound moral lesson. After reading this, try to pass judgment on the two brothers. I can't. Although I thought his previous book, Leave Myself Behind, dwelled too much on the cliched findings of journals in the walls of a house, this work establishes Yates as one of the top masters in this genre. Bring it on."
4,The Brothers Bishop,This was a wonderful reading experience and I truly enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to anybody who like to read.
3,Good and Bad,I loved the book up till the last chapter. The writer does keep your interest through out the book but I think he could have put some more thought in to the ending. The ending leave a lot to be desired and is very depressing.
2,Trite and Unbelievable,"I don't understand all the rave reviews about this book.it may be because i am in my 20's and therefore it does not seem that this book speaks to me.I found the characters all to be poorly fleshed out and the story to be completely unbelievable.The ending was extremely abrupt and (SPOILER ALERT) I found the protaginists new found lust for life and decision not to let the sea take him alos unbelievable. I mean this is a character who for the entire book was a loner with few people in his life he cared for other than his brother. When He loses his brother he suddenly decideds ""oh wow life is worth living in this dump of a town where my name has been ruined and i have lost the only person i truly love""It is a very sad sstate of affairs that this passes as Gay literature. I would more expect to find this in a romance section except in the end a merman should ahev carried the main character off.Truly dissapointed and hope some good gay writing comes along soon."
1,Nice try,"The author tried to pack too many themes, issues, chraterizations and a whole bunch of other stuff into a thin story about people it was difficult to care about. There were some moments of excellent writing but there were many more moments where the going was tough."
4,Consistent,"If you're a Forbert fan, you'll love the cd. The understated lyrics presenting pictures of life experiences flows easily from Steve's mind to his music. Written during and after a breakup from a long term relationship adds theme and passion to his latest release.I've seen him live a couple of times, own four of his cd's and would probably rank his ""The American in Me"" in my top ""100"". If you're a fan buy it. If you've never listened, try it."
3,Forbert Slips Into Mediocrity,"As a die-hard Steve Forbert fan who owns everything he's released (see my ""So You'd Like To"" guide on Forbert), I was rather disappointed with ""Just Like There's Nothin to It."" It isn't a bad album (I'm not sure that Forbert is capable of recording such a thing), but it's far from Forbert's best work. Song by song, each song is consistently listenable, but also consistent in falling short of the brilliance to which Forbert is capable. I certainly would recommend that newcomers start with Forbert's masterpieces, such as ""Alive on Arrival"" and ""Jackrabbit Slim,"" before buying this one."
4,great,"i needed this for my Stephen King collection of first editions, this was well with in my price range and is in great shape."
4,Self Defense,"I liked the book a lot. There were a few techniques that I had a harrd time understanding the first time through, but I think that they are pretty effective. Some may disagree, but hey, that's what this forum is for.The book was NOT meant to be, in itself, an instructor. No book can do that. You have to understand that and look at the book as a supplement to your current training."
3,"Not really needed , that's all.","This book is a self defense , step by step , do-as-in-the picture book.It's quite good actually , in comparison to others of it's kind. But the point is that a book like that would never have been published if Bruce Lee was still alive. The set patterns of reactions against attack shown in it , are a complete contradiction to the basic ideas and open-mindness in JKD , That give the subject of fluidity in motion and continuation of movement , heavy importance.All in all , not bad , but I would'nt recommend it to a serious martial artist , that want's to understand those amazing insights that Bruce used to conjure without preceeding thought. The rest of the series is absolutley excellent though , And you should buy the rest without the first one."
4,"OK, but the other volumes are better","This is one of the early books on Bruce Lee's fighting methods. It's full of good stuff that will make any martial artist look at his own training to see how some of Lee's ideas can fit. There will always be the Jackie Chans and Jet Lis who will come along and dazzle us with their screen antics. But Bruce Lee was a seeker of knowledge, a true master of the fighting arts and philosophy. A great book to add to your collection.Loren W. Christensen, author of Fighter's Fact Book"
2,Works well if you have Bruce Lee's speed and power,"If you're a mere mortal and consequently do not possess the speed and power of Bruce Lee, then I don't recommend this book as a self defense guide. Choose another book or video based on striking (or grappling if that is your preference)."
3,"Simple, relativly practicle","Overall, this was a good book. The defences shown are very simple, and seem to embody a ""just hit him"" way of thinking. There are some escape techniques included, which make this book compatable in philosophy to the Krav Maga tape series. There are deficiencies, of course. There are no lessons on where to hit, or how to hit, and no chapters on awareness. Other books in this series basically cover the first two, and taken with them, this book is worth about ****. This book is best for someone with elementry knowledge of martial arts techniques, who wants to use those techniques for street defence. I think it CAN be useful to any schmoe who picks it up, but is better suited to someone who already knows how to throw a side kick. In conclusion, this book's strongest point is it's simplicity, while it's greatest weekness is the lack of awareness training."
3,the worst of four great books,"This is volume one of a four book series. I always thought that this book should have been last. It tells you what to do if you are attacked in this or that way (like the oh so common scenario where you are attacked by a maniac with a bo staff). But the other three books will actually show you how to go about doing the moves that you are supposed to do in this book. This book will tell you to punch, but not how to punch. It's still kind of neat, and you might as well buy it if you have the other three in the set."
2,This isn't Bruce Lee's fighting method!,"This is a book written by a student of Lee's who evidently could not learn all of what Bruce had to offer. The result? Improvization by the author. Perhaps this is what Bruce Lee wanted, then again, Bruce Lee had his head in the clouds most of the time.2 stars because it mentions Bruce Lee's name. More of a novelty than an actual training manual."
2,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"Ehhm, Right !!! If you guys think this will ever safe your life in a street fighting forget guys. Why, isn't it about Street Fighting ? Yes, but nobody fights like that in REAL LIFE. You will never have the oportunity of fighting like that!!!"
3,simple and effective enough,"Basically this is a how to manual with clear pictures of solutions for different self defense situations. Very suitable for beginners and to train at home, that's very good about this book. On the other hand I think some of the techniques are somewhat unrealistic because of high kicking and the defense against multiple attackers. The book is worth buying and a reasonable guide to train from, it gives you good guidelines. But don't expect too much of it."
2,Works only if you are Bruce Lee or able to spend years perfecting techniques,"If you have the technical skill of Bruce Lee, or look forward to attaining that level, then this book is for you. If, however, you are like 99.99999% of the rest of the human race, then the techniques in this book are impractical and trying to apply them will get you killed. Look for something else that is suited to the time and effort that you will put into learning how to defend yourself."
1,Bruce did not write this!,"I really don't have much to say other than Bruce Lee did not, and could not have written any of the books in this series, Bruce's first book ""Tao of Jeet Kune Do"" as far as I know is the only real book written by Bruce Lee and that book wasn't even released until after he died, so I'm only writting this review to say don't be fooled please!"
5,"Great TV overall, but not without cons","I'm not a TV expert by any means but I did my research before buying this TV. This pretty much gives you what most reviews have said about this. The picture quality is amazing, the controls are easy, and the swivel base is very useful for connecting things behind the TV. The bad piece is that the TV is extremely reflective. You will want to watch your darker movies at night with the lights turned off. Another bad piece is that LG supplies really poor screws for the base. I had read enough about this that I was very careful putting it together, but the screws strip very easily. Also, just FYI, this TV is much heavier than its 47inch LG counterparts. The only thing I could think of was that LED local dimming makes the TV heavier than the edge lit TVs but like I said I'm not a TV expert :)"
3,"Extremely reflective, Timer issues, Ghosting, Bad Cust service.","Got this in Dec 2010. The screen is ridiculously reflective. Powersaver/Autoadjust feature produces bad images, Local Dimming isn't very effective because the LED blocks are huge and any white letters on a black background will have at least 2 inches square ghostly glow around them bright enough to see across the room. Replacing a 14 year old TV that had 2 timers, this has only one, The clock loses at least two minutes a week, and when you set the timer to turn it on, it turns itself off 2hrs after, even when you do not set an off time. Did I mention the clock will only show military time? Who are they making these things for? Customer service is awful. They won't send anyone out on weekends, so you would have to take a day off work, and the one kid they DID send (an actual LG rep) knew less about the TV and how it worked than I do. And I am no expert- I've just been paying attention and doing some research."
3,Glass panel front is VERY reflective,"The great picture and good viewing angles for an LCD/LED were the reasons I bought this for our living room. It did not disappoint with either picture quality or viewing angle. But the EXTREMELY reflective glass panel covering this beautiful TV made it virtually unwatchable even though it was angled away from the main window. The blacks were so black we could watch ourselves watching TV in the dark areas of the picture -- especially while watching movies, which tend to be darker than regular TV. Many of the plasmas I've seen in the stores are less reflective, which makes plasmas viable options if you think you can handle a glass panel. The TV has been returned and we're shopping for less reflective replacement."
4,Great picture,I love this tv and the picture is great super clear the simplink on the remote matches your two systems blue Ray player to tv with a push of a button super easy I don't use half the stuff this tv is capable of bit it is really easy to figure out
1,Bad picture and customer service,I purchased it online and when I received it I had problems with the picture quality. So I contacted LG customer service and they sent a technician. He said it needed to be replaced as the problem is the panel but because LG technical department insisted they decided to change the mother-board. So the technician came a second time and changes the mother-board and installing new firmware but as expected no improvement (and these are the only two services that can be done on a LCD TV). So after contacting LG customer service they told me now another technician has to come and look at it!! so we scheduled another service. the new technician came and confirmed the problem (for each appointment I had to take time off work). So when I call back they tell me that the technician needs to come back one more time!!! At that point I gave up and just returned the TV.
5,LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!,"If you enjoy chuckling as you read or smiling so much your cheeks hurt... run, don't walk to buy One Lucky Lord. The chemistry between Thomas and Fia not to mention the cast of characters (Thunder, Zeus and Lord Thomas and of course Robert, how can I forget Robert) that bring this book to life will make you wish Kim Bennet had a backlist a mile long! Thank you Kim for bringing some laughter into my day, that alone is worth any price!"
2,Not what I expected,"This product did not meet my expectations at all. It was flimsy and poorly made, but then again, you get what you pay for."
1,carpet tread protectors,"[[ASIN:B000BPOS7K Superior American 5300030 24"" Clear Stair Tread]This product was unservicable for use on carpeted stairs. There is no ""grip Pattern"" on the underside of the vinyl. Stepping on this carpet protector was like walking on water over ice. The tread slipped from under foot and caused one to fall. The mfg. described the item properly and provided a refund upon return as advertised"
5,AMAZING!!!,"I found this book in a store and as soon as I saw it, I bought it! The artist for this book is great and there is a bird's eye map/drawing for almost every Manhattn neighborhood. Nearly an encyclopedia for New York Culture! Even if you don't plan on going to NYC soon, get this book if you enjoy architecture."
5,extremely helpful,"We used this book on our first visit to Manhatten and found the book to be very helpful. After preparing for our visit with this book, I felt comfortable and a familiarity with the city."
5,Terrific,I love this product because of all the antioxidents contained within it. The price and delivery was great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Do yourself a favor and get it for your body.In the winter raises your auto-immunity!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Baroque/Classical Beauty!,"This is a fine collection of beautiful, romantic melodies! They have depth and eloquence and are performed in a style that sounds baroque to me. It is not your 'average', straight-forward classical CD set...NO. This set is special, perfect to give as a gift for an anniversary, a birthday, a wedding, or for a dinner date. It is highly-recommended. I'm hooked! It's better than most straight-forward, classical CDs out there. I have purchased a few, but can truly say that I just keep coming back to this set! It draws you in and is perfect while driving, reading, lounging around, on a rainy day, at work, and to get you to sleep! This set just gets harder to find since it is truly THAT good! I think you'll love it for hours of listening enjoyment. I'm surprised no one prior has given a review of this wonderful set. You won't regret it!"
5,Buenazo,"Un cambio absoluto en la musica en espanol, a pesar de lo subido de tono de sus letras el sonido es genial, sin duda lo mejor de la nueva oleada de musicos mexicanos. Por cierto, para algunitos, revisen su orto...grafia."
2,No es para tanto,"Un Disco para mi gusto sobrevalorado, en realidad, es tan bueno? este disco es para los que caen con el apantallamiento facil y se cren la actitud que toma la banda en sus letras, en realidad tengo que decirlo algunos temas son muy buenos, pero hay otros que jamas deberian haber sido grabados, la ""chavada"" cae redondita con las letras de la banda, epro, son tan buenas? el decir una bola de sandeces es gran musica? no es por ser regazon, pero es algo que las banadas anglosajonas llevan haciendo por años, bueno, tal ves ese sea el punto: este disco revoluciono la mijigata radio latina (en especial la mexicana) con sis letras, pero si buscas uno de los mejores discos del movimiento latino, estas viendo en la direccion incorrecta"
2,These hombres got nothin' on RATM,"I read a review on Rage Against the Machine that claimed this band is ""a million times better"" than RATM. I have only one problem with that opinion - it's wrong. These guys have a pretty good sound. Nice, hard riffs and basslines, but I think they could've found a better singer. This guy has a major speech impediment. The vocals don't even sound like English, for Webster's sake!! And those song titles??? Some are legible, but most look like Greek to me. How about a little spell check next time?!I AM over the age of 13!"
4,Molotov finds the true meaning of rock,"With its live-sounding performances, irreverent attitudes..., and kick-...rock, ""Donde Jugaran"" finds the rock spirit which sadly gets lost sometimes. Most of the disc is in Spanish, but there's enough English to figure out what most of the songs are about, and if you can understand Mexican curse words, you've got about 80% of the lyrical content. Fun album, starting with the album cover."
3,Portable Ipod speakers,"Eleven year old son wanted these speakers. He loves them but personally I don't think they are that great, but for the money..."
5,Why not this one?,"First things first: This is as close as you can come to a comic that is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. If you are not yet familiar with Darby Conley's wonderful series of ""Get Fuzzy"" comics, this is as good a place to start as any. While there may be periodic storylines that span several strips, for the most part they are self-contained ""day-in-the-life"" observations that have, on occasion, made me fall out of my chair with laughter. Sometimes focusing on animal behavior, Conley more often focuses on the character flaws implicit in the dogs, cats and people that populate his strip (most frequently, a cat named Bucky) and their interactions with each other. To sum up: hysterically funny. If you are a dog and/or cat owner (or simply a keen observer of human nature), you should definitely look into ""Get Fuzzy"" -- why not begin with this one?"
3,Not for the casual fan,"This book is not for the casual fan. If you cherish those moments where Bucky says something particularly out there or Rob is particularly sarcastic in his reply, step away slowly. This book is for those who enjoy long storylines that for the most part link together (Bucky spends a week trying to snare, and, consequently, getting his butt whooped by a ferret, which leads him to sue the ferret on Judge Judy). I know that I am not a casual fan, but I still find the irreverent, laugh out loud humor better than long storyliness. If you are like me, I would reccomend Say Cheesy and Groovitude."
1,"Never Again, Blueprint for Failure.","When will we actually see a great new strip? All of the great writers are a thing of the past. I remember the hayday of comics. The Far Side, Calvin and Hobbes. Bloom County etc. People are just pretending that Get Fuzzy is funny. It is Not Funny. What Darby should do is get of his high horse. Usually great artists have some self loathing, which actually makes their strips good. Conley is too stuck on himself to make the strip presentable. He also uses too much from other strips. An example of this would be the ""Are You Bucksperienced"" cover to one of the other collections. Berkley Breathed used that same type of musical cover to his homage to U2 and Bruce Springsteen. Darby dont do things that have already been done before. It just shows your inflamed ego and that you are more unoriginal than a designer imposter."
1,Plain Disaster.,"Scalded by an ex lover, Satchel sets out to set the score on all women. Bucky and Rob try and knock some sense into the injured pride of Satchel. ""Not until I show them what I can do!"", screams the depressed pooch. First it was one homeless girl. The next victim was a prostitute. The deaths keep mounting until the FBI finally catches up to Satchel and puts an end to his carnage.Based on The Son of Sam's serial killing spree, one would be rivited to this novel if for not the fact that we had seen the main characters in a different light before this. The Son Of Sam had been a mailman. Satchel has always hated postmen. This may be the reason that Conley has gone after the mail service. Could it be that Conley has an irrational hatred of the Postal Service? I for one enjoyed the original formula Cnley used in his books, that being the mundane life of Opus, Garfield and Jon."
1,Don't buy it,"As much as I love Darby Conley's characters and acid humour, I won't buy any other get fuzzy book as most of them are a complete scam, a fraud, a collection of recycled cartoons published over and over.Blueprint for disaster is entirely included in Bucky Katt's Big Book Of Fun, which I bought in a combo recommended by both, the publishers and Amazon. How was I to know that I was buying the same book twice?.Shame on you"
1,pretty dumb humor,"Unless you find reading a book full of dumb masturbation and boner comics entertaining, I would skip this one. There are many better comic books out there which pertain to more intelligent topics. I would normally sell a book which I don't want, this one I choose to burn, as I don't want anyone else wasting their time and money on it."
4,Great first novel!,"I happened on to this at a local library. I found myself quickly wrapped up in this book. The situations and dialogues are very believable and realistic. I found that it rushed the ending a little and some of the earlier details were sacrificed, like she had more to say but had to pare it down. However, I am anxiously awaiting Esposito's second effort."
3,Not her best...,"I've read all of Tamora Pierces books. Her books can make you feel like your in a different place and you can't help but love her characters. This book was about Daja, an arsonist, and dajas two new twin students. The story about the twin students was great and had everything you looked for in her earlier books. The book also got you more in touch with Daja and her way of life and her beliefs. The only part in the book that really brought everything to waste was the arsonist. The whole arsonist concept was not bad, but the details and feelings that the arsonist expressed are definatly not suitable for younger audiences. This book would probably be good for ages 12 or 13 and up. It would definatly not be a good one to read to little kids!"
2,This Book Bored Me,"Lack of mystery ruined this book. A mysterious arsonist is setting fires in the city Daja has found her twin apprentices in. (And unlike the others of the Opening Circle, she *has* found primary teachers, so all she does is the meditation. No student/teacher personality conflicts. Boring...) But wait! Pierce writes a scene from arsonist's perspective in like chapter four, so the reader knows exactly who is he through the whole novel. And this reader kept calling Daja an idiot for not realizing it.The mystery had no suspense. The apprentice side-plot got resolved too easily. Daja teaches her twins meditation (two separate methods) and finds them primary teachers, and that's it. The most interesting part of the novel for me was Daja learning how to ice skate. All the drama with the fires and the arsonist was wasted because I knew his identity the entire time!Very disappointed with this one."
3,BROKE 2ND TIME USED,WORKS GREAT IF IT WOULD LAST. 2ND DAY THE TRIGGER WENT OUT AND NOW IM IN SEARCH OF A TRIGGER SWITCH.
2,"Great idea, disappointing performance","First, let me say that the automatic feed is the best idea I have seen in a while. I own several other Senco nailers and bought this on the reputation. The cut out saw is great.The DuraSpin DS200 is underpowered and the battery is weak. I have charged and recharged the battery as recommended. I get about twenty screws per charge as opposed to the 200 the company indicates on one charge.I like the weight of the driver, the convenience of the side clip, and the feed system is extraordinary.The other problem is that with the square drive screws, entry has to be exactly straight or they wander and misalign with the bit. It would be nice if the company developed a ""deck mate"" strip for the DuraSpin.For my experience, I should have saved my money. It would be nice if Senco could fix it because it sure is a good idea."
3,DURASPIN,I have used my Duraspin on 3 jobs now. It is an excellent concept that obviously was thought out well. I have experienced some difficulty on square drive screws going crooked and with not getting consistent depth of drive when my hand pressure varies during driving the screw but I think both of these problems will go away with more practice. The cut out tool that came with the gun is excellent. I recommend this gun to anyone who uses screws alot. Just wish it had reverse. With only forward drive I still have to keep my cordless drill with me.
4,Just As Advertised,The Deni Magic Vac worked just as advertised. I'm very pleased at this time will see if I feel same in six months.
4,Using Book in Class,"This is an interesting book. I am using it for my Writing for Mass Media class. The author puts at least 5-10 exercises at the end of each chapter for you to review the concepts which were talked throughout the chapter. Not really a sit down and read book, but does go over writing for media basics."
4,Gentle and Subtle,"This is a very different kind of storytelling. Everything is shown, almost nothing is told. You have to be keen to pick up the clues, but the scenes are all so quiet that it's too easy to think nothing is happening. Often, even the placement of the camera is telling you something.It's a slow, gentle, slice-of-life look at one modern woman's relationships. Not for everyone."
5,Recommending to anyone who enjoys autobiographies!,R.H. Miller provides very descriptive detail with every sentence. This wonderful book is an autobiography of R.H. Miller's life as he remembers it as a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults). A fascinating book that you can hardly put down.
3,Average Blade,"This is a very average blade and I just found this out when I got to try out my instructors m. maze carbon butterfly racquet. It made this one feel ridicously weak. The pace raquet is a good one for beginners, but now I feel like I have to put all my energy into hitting the shots when the carbon one just zooms the ball back with just a tap. Once you get to playing ranked players, it might be a good idea to switch to one with better 'feel'."
2,Mandoline,I wasn't satisfied with the product at all. The safety knob was far too large and I have huge hands. It actually hurt my palms. Would not recommend.
1,Junk,"VERY hard to cut anything--VERY VERY DULL blades, didn't cut straight, very large/bulky....sent back to amazon for refund."
1,Pinzon Mandoline is Junk,"Looks like it would be one of the best slicers on the market.However, the product is junk. I tried several fruits & vegetables & the results were so frustrating--I stopped-and went back to my15 year old Bronor 19.95 V-Slicer. I am returning the 2 mandolins. One was for my mother. She would not say anything to me because it was a gift.She would just put in her junk pile in the basement. Save your money--or go ahead & you will get the same results and frustrations like me."
1,Product design,This has a basic product design flaw- the handle for gripping the food is a defective design and does not work.
1,Don't buy this!,"I was really looking forward to receiving this. I purchased the Pinzon coffee press and was pleased with the quality and great price. The slicer, however, was junk. Solidly made, but as other reviewers have said, the blades were dull. It couldn't even slice a tomato. I returned it for a refund."
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"My husband gave this to me for Christmas; unfortunately I wasn't able to use it till a couple of months later, because of family illness. The machine is junk, a total rip-off. Now it's too late to send the thing back.Don't buy it!"
3,Fairly good mandoline,"I like the legs which set up a good angle. Prior to buying this, I used a friends mandoline which did not have legs and it hard to hold steady while slicing. The blade seems sharp but takes a little more force to slice potatoes than the other mandoline I used. The handle is slotted so you have to make sure the food is small enough to get the handle in the guides (a little extra work)."
1,I got this as a gift to a die hard FireFly fan,"She seemed to love it, the books prited quality is great and ships in mint condition. Way better than a bookstore."
5,Excellent Adaptation,"I am a long time pen/paper RPG player, starting from D+D, World of Darkness, Space Opera, and too many others to remember. And yes, I do indeed have a life. Anyway...I found this a well thought out, highly playable adaptation of an absolutely beautiful universe. Well worth the money. Will likely pick up some of the companion books in the near future."
5,Excellent RPG,"This game is very well written with the entire text in the general spoken word style of ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"". The system is different, but still pretty intuitive once you look at it. There are 2 sample crews (of course, one is that of Serenity herself) and a number of ships Alliance and privately-owned. If you're a fan of the series and even somewhat interested in RPGs, you're very likely to enjoy Serenity RPG."
