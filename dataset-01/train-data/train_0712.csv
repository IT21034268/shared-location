3,And oldie but ummm.. pretty goodie,"I enjoy doing reviews of obscure stuff, and Absolute Pinball fits the bill. I just pulled it out after a couple years without playing it, and it works just fine on DosBox in Windows XP. Four tables of differing difficulty and many minigames await your pinball wizardry.Being as old as it is you won't find mind-boggling graphics or great sound, but it's solid for a game from the mid 90's. There are a few minor annoyances here and there, and the baseball table is extremely easy - I've many times put up points in the billions thanks to huge multipliers on the bonuses, although I think they have a math problem as well. But still, if you find it for a couple bucks and don't mind figuring out DosBox (it's not hard if you read the instructions), I would recommend the old-school Absolute Pinball."
5,Piper ranks as Floyd's best,"""Stairway Scare"" is right. Syd Barrett leads his Floyd through an album that is as well written as anything after it. Moreover, the playing is superior to any other Floyd LP. Barrett's guitar work is original, atmospheric, and exciting (unlike certain other Floyd guitarists....). Waters' bass guitar is likewise inspired, as is Nick Mason's drumming. But the best part may be Rick Wright, who complments the music with grace and beauty. Each song is a totally original soundscape, and beauty sits together with madness quite well on the album (making it one of the few truely psychedelic albums that was also popular on the charts). Every listen to this album gives me a new favorite Floyd song (right now it's Chapter 24). Also, check out Floyd's early singles with Barrett, which are just as good."
5,"One of the best albums I have ever heard, a must buy.",Piper At The Gates Of Dawn takes your on a journey thru different riffs and sounds that blow your mind away. Syd Barrett had the potential to be one of the greatest rock stars ever to pick up a guitar. The simple yet joyess guitar on Gnome still makes me smile. The powerful and weak moments of Interstellar Overdrive sends you on an unknown adventure. This is easily one of the best albums of assembled by a rock group. It is the definition of visual rock in the 60's.
4,"Psychedelia, Thy Name is Floyd","Give up your Sgt. Pepper's fetish.Let go of your Door's debut LP.The Byrds? Poseurs. The Stones ""Satanic Majesties""? Not on par by a long shot. The Who? Mere songbirds.THIS is psychedelia.It doesn't make sense. It's not supposed to make sense. What does ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk"" mean? Does it matter? No. Has there ever been a song as willfully silly as ""Bike"" that didn't appear on a Monty Python collection? Probably not. It's more than acid and flowers, it's the embracing of the non-linear, the surreal.As others have pointed out, the soul of this album is the intrumental ""Interstellar Overdrive"", but that only emphasizes my point, starting with as hard a rock riff as Floyd ever crushed out, leading us through the stars only to bring us back to the beginning, only we don't hear it the same way. Take from it what you will..."
5,Floyd's Hyperkinetic Debut,"Pink Floyd's first album is a wonderful showcase for Syd Barret's manic/depressive virtuosity. The album exhibits a much different character than other floyd albums due to Barret's ability for wacky genius. The weakest track on the album is the only non-Barret composition, Waters's ""Take up thy stethoscope and walk"" a song lacking the depth and inventiveness of the other tracks.If Barret hadn't been transported into another dimension via LSD overload, Pink Floyd would have been a much different beast. Though not as technically adept nor melodic as David Gilmour, Barret's raw and intense playing drives the tracks thru a myriad of emotions and textures.One interesting fact about this album is that it was recorded at the same time as Sgt Pepper in adjacent studios. Maybe a creative and wonderful surge of energy was present in the air to catalyze the creation of two revolutionary landmark albums."
3,Their weakest album,"Pink Floyd began making great albums beginning with ""Meddle"" up until ""Division Bell"". All those records are essential and must haves, but I'd say that this one and ""Saucerful of Secrets"" and ""More"" are for completists only."
2,"Dammit, I love Pink Floyd, but...","I found this album very dissapointing. It pains me terribly deeply, but the whimsical tunes in this album just dont seem floydian. The floyd I love has a sound that just runs through you. I'm not even really conscious of the songs on other albums, they just fit and become the natural noise. I like Syd Barrets guitar ok, but I hate to say (No, I don't), Gilmour puts something in to Pink Floyd thats just not there I'm sorry, Stone me if you like, I just don't dig on the Monkies all too much."
2,Syd isn't Pink Floyd,"This album, although it has some nice songs, like Astronomy Domine, is an experiment. A failed one. I really love Floyd, but you cannot compare creations like Cymbaline, Wish you were here, Echoes, or Shine on, with this album, now really ridiculous. If you want predarkside Floyd, just buy Meddle or AHM."
2,Does not hold a candle to Roger and Gilmour,"This was not a bad album, I would like to start off with and some may really enjoy it. In my opinion however, the originality of the album does not make up for old school music that has not aged like fine wine. If you have heard this and like it, go ahead and buy it. But for me, a fan of Pink Floyd's later work, this was a dissapointment."
2,Not the Pink Floyd you're used to...,"Warning!Just because you like ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and ""The Wall"", there's no guarantee that you'll find this album listenable, let alone enjoy it.This is an ""Amazon Essential"" album, and, although it's important in the Pink Floyd scheme of things, for many people (myself included), it's more of a historical note than a favorite work.If you're looking to expand your Floyd collection, make sure you've picked up Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall before going any further.If you're looking for an undiscovered Floyd classic, pick up ""Obscured by Clouds"" instead."
2,An okay debut album,"This is not the album that made Pink Floyd famous 4 making a history of rock & art. This is good 4 a debut album 2 a new group, but what came from Obscured by Clouds and Meddle is important! I am the fan of their Meddle-The Wall period, and don't really like their work before and after, but this is me. This album is different from Animals, it is nothing 2 do with Wish U were here, this album is not similar 2 Dark Side or The Wall. This album is like Relics, A saucerful of secrets and Ummagumma. If U like these, buy it. If U R a fan of the Wish U were-era, beware of it, U will never like it as much as some people do. It's another world, Barret's world."
5,Something I Can't Explain,"I never really liked Pink Floyd, but this album isn't really Pink Floyd's. It's Syd Barrett's, and without a doubt his best. Barrett gave psychedelia a uniquely English twist, rooting his music in childhood memories, Victorian lit and an art school passion for American rhythm & blues in a way that parallels, without really imitating, the Beatles. Barrett wasn't a genius, but one of those quirky, original talents that doesn't sound quite like anyone else. 'Bike', 'Astronomy Domine,' 'Lucifer Sam' and 'Flaming' aren't really songs in the conventional sense; they're backing riffs for his nave, strangely compelling high school-journal poetry. And of course his most famous riff, 'Interstellar Overdrive,' is one for the ages. I've nearly burned a hole through my CD since I got this. If you've got even the slightest interest in Sixties music, I bet you will too."
5,I Cannot Stand This Album...But I Love It!!!,"Pink Floyd's debut album is indeed strange material both lyrically and musically. Astronomy Domine says it straight away: ""Neptune Titan Stars Can Frighten..."". Lucifer Sam: ""That Cat's Something I Can't Explain"". All the tracks (except ""Pow R. Toc H."" and ""Interstellar Overdrive"" which doesn't have lyrics) are lyrically weird. I like the lyrics so much! This album has best lyrics than any other PF album has. Of course there's melodies and riffs I cannot stand: Scarecrow is the worst. It is just clapping and lousy singing...it shouldn't be here. And just when you thought that you have passed the strangest moments...there's bike...a ""romantic"" song...""You're the kinda girl...I'll give you...everything...if you want things..."". I wonder what Syd Barret has been doing when there's these kind of lyrics...maybe I should try too...Stars: Astronomy Domine, Flaming, Lucifer Sam"
3,This is the same band that did THE WALL?,"I was introduced to Pink Floyd, as most were, by their opus THE WALL. Now, liking this album, I went on an epic quest to get all of their albums.This, being their first, was one I *HAD* to get. And, boy, the first time I listened to this one, I was HUGELY disappointed. This was 60s psychedelia. Not exactly my style. But it slowly grew on me. ""Astronomy Domine,"" ""Lucifer Sam,"" ""Interstellar Overdrive,"" and ""Bike"" are all terrific songs. Most of the rest are listenable. ""Pow R. Toch"" and ""The Scarecrow"" however are terrible. Syd was an interesting song writer, just not for my tastes."
3,Not a good concept album,"This is a great album, don't get me wrong. But Syd Barret was so off his rocker, that it could kind of get to you a little. For the Floydians who like to grasp some type of a concept from a Pink Floyd album, this is not a good record to get hooked on. These are simply fun songs, and have good rythyms to them. ""Bike"" is fun to sing along to..and any Floydian fan that has had an infatuation with a girl before can relate to it."
3,A decent start....,"Pink Floyd's debut album is a somewhat enjoyable piece of work - the labors of four very young and, at the time, relatively inexperienced musicians in the music industry. Aided by their producer (and former Beatles engineer) Norman Smith's studio mastery, Pink Floyd presents a modest slew of songs with just enough catchy melodies to keep you interested. Though soon surpassed by the Roger Waters era of songwriting, this album offers a good historical perspective of a band that would eventually find enormous popular appeal."
5,Syd Barrett,"This album is like nothing else you will ever hear. Syd Barrett named then created the vision of the band, was the songwriter of the band, the lead guitarist of the band, and the lead singer of the band. Nothing Floyd ever did following his departure in 68 would sound the same, this is an album that needs repeated listens to be fully appreciated. Syd Barrett was a Diamond in the rough, a true innovator, a genius, and this would be PF's best album till DSOTM."
5,Syd Barrett's finest hour!!!,"One of my many favorite Pink Floyd albums!!! This one shows the genius and musical talent of the founding member of Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett. One can only imagine the direction that PF would have gone had Syd been around longer!!!"
5,BEST ALBUM EVER,"If you only buy one CD in your whole life make it this one. I only vaguely framiar with Pink Floyd when I recieved this album and was not a huge fan. All i knew about was DSOTM and The Wall and stuff like that. A friend let me listen to his copy, i was astounded by how good it was!!! I can't explain why. Something about the way Syd makes all his voice slure. Something about the long periods of free form jamming. Something about the fairytale psychadelic lyrics. JUST BUY IT!!! But be warned that this album is so addictive that it'll make all your other CD's obsolete because you wont want to listen to any but this one for about a month straight. Don't be ashamed to listen to Bike 20 times in a row."
4,Floyd's Debut,"Early Pink Floyd is psychadelic Floyd, and only rarely resembles the sounds associated with their more famous works of the 1970s. This is partially because of the presence of Syd Barrett, whose mark on the band is clear and deep, despite only having been with them for this first album (and some spot work on the second). That said, this is a good album, and many fans think of this early psychadelic era as their best period. The opening tandem of ""Astronomy Domine"" and ""Lucifer Sam"" is very strong."
5,Erratic but brilliant,"It's hard to imagine an album more different from the anonymous, arena space-rock Pink Floyd would perfect after the departure of troubled front man and primary songwriter Syd Barrett.Piper, by contrast, is the realization of an intensely personal vision, and the combination of Barrett's whimsical poetry, his unconventional song structures, and a sonic landscape sculpted with the aid of plenty of hallucinogens resulted in one of the most audacious, endearing, and erratically brilliant albums in the history of rock n' roll."
3,Storm Thorgerson shines again.,"The man's done it again!! Yet again, Storm has released a new viewer-friendly conceptual art project using the same crusty old tracks from pink floyd's back catalouge (the one's that the record company keeps re-releasing by using the continually updated, flashy redesigned packaging that Storm is so good at. Storm thorgerson is Sony Music's pink floyd cash cow. His association with the band has yeilded excellent karma for him. I want to give a shout out to storm: Sell your great artwork to people specifically looking for art and stop whoring yourself to the record companies shameless process of re-selling the same old albums that we've already bought. C'mon, man! Find some integrity within!!"
3,"2 tones, 20 years flash-back!","Geweldig om die stoffige plaat boven op zolder via dit medium te kunnen horen - maar dat terzijde. Na enkele fragmenten ruik en zie je enorm veel momenten aan je neus en ogen voorbij schieten... -maar ook dat terzijde.'Moeilijk' te beluisteren muziek, waanzinnige tonen, maar er spreekt een ultieme passie uit om de uithoeken van muzikale mogelijkheden te onderzoeken.Geweldig dus!"
2,I have to say that I don't get it,"I respect everyone's opinion in here, and I've tried so hard to love this album because I love Pink Floyd and I see how everyone calls it a classic. But I just do not get it. I highly overrated album IMO. Very childlike and underdeveloped, but maybe that is its charm? I see 2 very different Pink Floyds and I have to say I never got into Syd's style. Matilda this, Lucifer that. The Gnome? come on. Astromony Domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious collectors, this is a must have and I'll give it 2 stars, but stay away if you expect another 'Wish you were here' purchase, pre-Gilmour can be a tough listen."
3,Disappointment,"I had really expected more from this album. The lyrics and style are a little too goofy and exaggerated for my taste. If you are a fan of Pink's 70's era music, then you'll find this album shockingly different from normal Pink Floyd.The sounds and guitar (especially in the song ""Interstellar Overdrive"") I find grate on your nerves after a while, and, I find, are very annoying.The vocals are alright, which is why i gave this three (not one) stars. If you like The Beatles then you might like the vocals in this album, but Im not sure i can compare the sounds and feel with anything else, except disappointment. For all the praise this album gets, I find it overrated."
3,"Much hyped early album, but does anyone really enjoy it?","There seems to be a lot of nostalgia for this the early works of Pink Floyd. Piper of the Gates of Dawn is really Syd Barrett's vision, and a psychedelic one at that. There is a lot of nonsense written about this guy in the music press. The reality is he was too unstable, and was simply replaced by Dave Gilmour, and the creative force behind the band became his partnership with Roger Waters. They went on to produce some great records: Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. For me they started to get repetitive at The Wall, and later albums lack the quality that was present in the 70s. Forget the 60s offerings, Piper is a lukewarm interesting album, but really only for those who want every album Floyd ever produced. If you buy this expecting a forgotten masterpiece you will be disappointed. Just being honest!"
1,Garbage,This is horrible. How did Pink Floyd get a record deal with this crap? Sid frying his brain with acid and having to leave is apparently the best thing that ever happened to this band.
1,what the...,"being a huge fan of syd barrett, i found this album to be badly produced, the songs drift with no direction. just because its out there does not make it genius.i really am sorry floydians but this album is weak and sounds horrible."
1,The worst,I can't believe people are giving this 5 stars. It's the worst pink floyd album I've ever heard.
1,Pink Floyd fans can thank God...,"... that Syd Barrett was sufficiently stupid to effectively throw his life away via mindless drug use, otherwise Pink Floyd would have remained a completely inconsequential band putting out laughably pretentious garbage like ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" instead of riding the extreme talents of David Gilmour to the heights of musical genius."
1,No Way This Is Essential Floyd,"Why Does Amazon Rate This Floyd Album As Essential? Piper At The Gates And Saucerful Are Worth A Listen Or Two To Hear The Bands Roots, But Thats Where It Ends. Guess It's O.K. With A Hell Of A Buzz, But Not In Any Other State Of Mind."
5,The Debut..,"Go back to 1967, The doors were making it big, and then the beatles released Sgt. Pepper and the doors and sgt. pepper made the so called ""summer of love."" Then you have Pink Floyd who tells a bunch of psychedelic stories followed by eerie and unique sounds by drums, keyboard, bass, and guitar. Personally, the album is amazing, my favorite song is ""Interstellar Overdrive"" because it has a huge jam, improvisational sound that warps the mind. When I listen to that song I get tired 'cuz I'm in such a haze by all the sounds around me and the fact that the audio switches from speaker to speaker on my headphones. This album has a lot of pop ditties and sounds so unlike any other Pink Floyd you have ever heard because this was Syd's album, and what an album it was."
5,My favorite album of all time!,"This album is cool because it's so different than most stuff you hear these days. And unlike what a lot of people say about Syd Barrett, you don't have to be on acid to appreciate it. Sure, songs like ""Bike"" are strange, but that's what's so great about them! Another cool song is ""Interstellar Overdrive."" It's kind of similar to another band that can't be found here. They are called Uncle Dave and they do a lot of improvised instrumental music like this song. If you like this you may like them too. But anyway, this is a really great CD that you should go ahead and buy."
5,Fun Pink Floyd: an oxymoron?,"Good ol' Syd Barrett was the main catalyst behind this weird, whimsical psychedelic masterpiece. Though is not the best Floyd album, it is probably one of the poppiest and least self-important. Granted, not every Floyd fan has to love this. But, you can't overestimate how important this album (and Barrett) were. If it was not for Barrett, the name Pink Floyd would not exist, and a lot of psychedelic music and Floyd's subsequent work, echeoed the album's songs. ""Bike"" has to be the highlight here, Barrett proving to all doubters that he is one of the great eccentrics."
5,a terrific debut album,Piper at the gates of dawn has got to be amongst the greatest debuts of all time and figures amongst my favourite albums.very highly recommended.BUY TODAY.
1,This is the biggest piece of trash I have ever heard,"I realize people have to start somewhere, but this is definitely a bad way to start. Just because it has the name ""Pink Floyd"" on it does not mean it is any good. They use sound effects, not instruments. The effect is one that resembles a kid getting a hold of some noisemakers and his fathers tape recorder. The music that is featured on the album sounds like early Who. Do not buy this album."
1,Dungeons & Dragons and Rock 'n' Roll: Two tastes that don't go great together,"Here's what happens when a bunch of unstable dolts from the Old Country get together and smoke banana peels and fistfulls of catnip. And the chin-droolers who call this art are the same saps who blog angry entries about there not being a Criterion version of ""Reefer Madness,"" their irony valve dried up like a used condom in the Tenderloin on a sunny day. So yeah, pass the granola and don your fruit stripe sarong, but I just gotta tell ya, if you're smoking anything through a pipe as morning is about to break like a rotten egg all over the sky, it's probably crack. What is this otherwise? Gut instinct tells me it's a concept album about a satanic astrophysician who collects wind-up chimes while journeying to the land at the bottom of the Sun with a wild pack of gnomes strapped to his back. See what I mean? I'd rather dig boogers out of my nostrils with a razor-riddled shoehorn than listen to this one more time."
1,stuff it where the su n don't shine,"Hey lonely doowop rangers like Hairy Mettle and The great dog in denial (The Nile), let me illucinate you (did anyone say *scatcat* here???)This CD is an enormous disgrace and an insult to good taste.Imagine meaningless, pointless bozo crapfest music and this will clearly be it.DO NOT BUY THIS lousy cd!joao"
1,overate it,"This CD is absolutely overrated. Sit Baret was just your average junkie. That's all.Not a very good album, therefore 0 stars.Jodey"
5,Absolutely Stoney,"This CD is incredible. You see how Pink Floyd has endured through the years by listening to this debut album. Syd Barrett's Lucifer Sam and Flaming is mind-blowing. I definitely suggest this for those who love ""Dark Side of the Moon"". Piper is the chicken and Dark Side is the egg!"
5,terrific remastered edition of band's debut,The excellent remastered edition of The band's debut album sounds terrific as compared to the bands previous editionof the album.It features the excellent Astronomy Domine and Interstellar overdrive and is highly recommended.
4,"Beware: ""Emily"" absent","The first track on the 1967 American release of ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" [Tower ST 5093] is the Syd Barrett gem, ""See Emily Play."" This is arguably the best song the Floyd ever recorded, but in England it was originally released only as a single. Since this new 2 cd re-release of Piper is the English album, ""Emily"" is not included. Floyd lovers may prefer to purchase the 3 cd set, ""LIMITED EDITION - EXTRA TRACKS"" scheduled for 9/11/07 release which includes ""Emily"" along with other singles from the period."
4,The madness that was Syd Barrett,"It's pretty obvious this album was done in the psychedelic sixties. Still, it's fascination to hear Pink Floyd under the creative direction of someone other than Roger Waters or David Gilmour. The centerpiece of this album is the bizarre guitar oddesey Barrett takes, pulling sounds out of his instrument one might not think possible.The album's best offering is the long, rambling ""Interstellar Overdrive."""
3,Dictionary Definition of Psychedelia,"Pink Floyd used to be Sid Barrett's band, and he wrote 9 of 11 on Piper by himself, and the two others with the rest of the band. What you think of the album depends on what you think of psychedelic music. ""Astronomy Domine"", ""Pow R Hoc H"", and ""Interstellar Overdrive"", are dark complicated songs that bear repeated listenings. ""Lucifer Sam"", ""Matilda Mother"", ""Flaming"", ""Take Up Thy Steth"", ""The Gnome"", ""Chapter 24"", ""Scarecrow"", and ""Bike"" are simpler songs with more childish lyrics -- they have more of a novelty value."
4,Not the classic Pink Floyd but it is still good.,"It doesn't sound like ""The Wall"" or ""Dark side"" but I would recomed it for true PF fans."
2,Whats Up???,"Well im not going to say i am totally disapointed, but this sounds like roger waters wrote the album and then the beatles performed it. compared to anamals and dark side this is a joke"
2,Sounds like Spinal Tap's early period,"I'm a Pink Floyd fan, but this record is extremely dated and I actually had to laugh while listening to some of it. I guess you have to be on acid to love it. Listening to Sgt. Pepper's or Blonde on Blonde or A Love Supreme and then putting this on is painful. Some of the songs sound like they were recorded with toy instruments and I can't believe a critic could sit through this and actually think its classic. Two Stars for the novelty and unintentional comedic effect."
2,Ooops! Roger Wins Again!,"""Piper"" is neither a Floyd of Syd masterpiece (as he never made any of those.) There is precious little of the stunning aural bravaura that would their sound (until ""dark Side,"" anyway)Instead what we get here is all the ""British whimsy"" that Syd Barrett is famous for. The first four tunes are pretty good (except for ""Astronomy"" which is mostly instrumental and not the best example of a ""great"" songwriter) But then, after the lumbering ""Powr Toch"" (chilling evidence that Syd and Roger could've been the ""Beavis and Butthead"" of swinging London) something bizarre happens; Waters weighs in with ""Take Up Thy Stehescope and Walk,"" which has a cool, jaunty melody, complete with profound lyrics such as ""Gold is led/ Jesus bled etc..."" and topped off with a booty shaking goove that would do any late sixties spy proud. The Floyd's aggressive bassman wins again; easily the best tune on the album."
2,Highly Overrated,"At the risk of being on the outs with my fellow Floyd fans I'm going have to say that is album is subpar. I know Sid Barret is a talented artist and has all the allure of the tragic rock star but the music presented here is just not all that great. I don't know, maybe its just because I really don't have much tolerance for quirky pyschedelia, but I just find this album to be trite and unexciting. I honestly would give this album only one star if it wasn't for the two instrumental pieces, ""Astronomy Domine,"" and ""Interstellar Overdrive."" These tunes are the only ones that seem to hint at what the Floyd was truly capable of, spacey soundscapes and jazz like interplay.As for the rest of the album it is severly dated. The songs are cheesy and silly much like the low points on classic Beatles or Cream albums. i.e. ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" from Abbey Road or ""Blue Condition"" from Disarelli Gears. All in all if you're a fan you should buy, but only to complete your collection. nuff said."
1,Worst Album of All Time?,"Pre-Gilmour Floyd? No thanks. Obscured by the Clouds, Meddle, I'd even try Atom Heart Mother for early Floyd. (Or before Darkside of the Moon Floyd). My problen with Pink Floyd is that a great number of their fans call their music ""amazingly psychedelic"" or ""trippy"" but cannot experience the music without tripping themselves. These are the fans that go to concerts to get wasted instead of going for the music. These are also the fans who would call Piper a musical masterpiece. Have any of you ever listened to that album or songs like ""Paint Box"" and ""Bike"" without being wasted? Funny how they really sound with a sober ear. And as far as guitar playing is concerned, Syd Barret is no David Gilmour. And as far as albums are concerned, ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" doesn't even hold up to ""More"" (a really bad Pink Floyd Soundtrack)."
2,Excuse me!,"I never liked the psychedelic stuff very much, and this one is not an exception. Too overrated. 'Masterpiece', 'masterwork', whatever? 'Syd is a genius' ? I won't call this a work of a genius.MUSIC: not that weak, but much worse if I compare this one to those trademark works of Pink Floyd which are meant to be their trademarks.There's better parts in the music, but they've got annoying psychedelic sound. That's a pity.LYRICS: good, but when I say I listen to music, that means that I listen to music. I don't care very much to the lyrics. Psychedelic, crappy. Abstract does not mean quality.VOCALS: Gilmour's voice sounds much better. Mr. Barrett is not a competent vocalist. That's doubtless.Honestly, I never liked this album. You would better check out their musically more significant work. That's the reason why they're here now."
3,When we was fab...,"Does the very thought of Dark Side, Animals and (shudder)The Wall make you nauseous? Me, too. Someone has called Piper ""the Pink Floyd album for people who hate Pink Floyd"". The Madcap laughs...at Roger's solo career!"
3,Early Floyd,"Piper at the Gates of Dawn. A little - no, a lot dated, very much a record of its time, gathering dust in the cutout bin while Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were all over the charts. So what is it now but an Aquarian artifact masterminded by an acid casualty and eclipsed by Floyd's rockstar glory in the Me decade and now a second- or third-priority entry in the Pink Floyd back catalog. Charming and (on 'Bike') a little scary. Accessible to fans of The Wall only in that it's available in most record stores, including this one. But it sounds so different than The Wall or Dark Side that it's not even a Pink Floyd album. It's a Syd Barrett album with a little help from Roger Waters, and that's it."
5,Psychedelic start,"To people who are only educated in Floyd's popular stuff from the 70s and forward, this album will be a shock. It's very unique compared to their more common music. But it's DIFFEREN'T not worse. This is a great album of historical value for any TRUE floyd fan but otherwise meaningless to the uneducated floyd follower. But for folks that have barely heard any pink floyd music at all, this is a perfect album to start with. If you are interested in floyd DO NOT go out and get Dark side of the Moon right away. Learn to enjoy their earlier stuff first and then DSotM will be a lot more meaningful."
5,Barrett the genius,"If you like the Pink Floyd of the 70's, you won't like this cd. The sound is completely different of the other Floyd albums. But this album is esspecially Syd Barrett's work. And the songs are crazy and funny. When Syd had to leave Pink Floyd a new band was born (albums like Animals,The Wall,Dark Side Of The Moon,Wish You Were Here etc are also stunning) but the band wasn't crazy and funny anymore. Buy this album if you listen you can hear how good Syd was."
4,"Piper is Good, But Saucerfull is Better","Piper is pure Syd psychedelia. Screeching guitar chords, and songs about Gnomes,Scarecrows,Unicorns highlight this early Floyd masterpiece.As good of an album as this is,however,I have always been more of a fan of Floyd's long experimental type cuts(ECHOES, ATOM HEART MOTHER, SAUCERFULL OF SECRETS,etc.)Favorite lyric from this one is""that cat's something I can't explain......."""
2,Ummm... what is the author trying to say??,"This book is not written well. I can hardly tell what the author is trying to say from all of the information he gives.A reader *might* like this book if they are very familiar with current sociology and anthropology. I say that because the author uses MANY references to other studies and other books, yet he does not explain the basics of what they say. Rather, he just assumes it is common knowledge. Unless you have been trained and are up to date on all the different sides, reading this book will be like trying to find your way through a maze!"
3,not very good,This toy is ok it would be better if it stayed together. It's hard to make the rainbow and the waterfall work but Honu Lo Lo the baby pegasses is soooo cute but if you're girl wants it get it get it if she doesn't don't well hope this was helpful Brooke.
3,Cordless Mic Review,"For the price paid, this was an acceptablevalue. However, the headsets do not operatevery well and are very difficult to adjustand tend to fall when in use. Used them ina church Christmas play and actors just hadtrouble keeping the headsets in place. Due tothe nature of the costumes, the label mics wouldnot pickup voices where the mic had to be placed sowe had to use the head sets. Overall worked ok."
1,Terrible!,"I hooked this item up and tried all 4 transmitters and all 8 mics. The only way I could get any sound was to yell into the mics or blow really hard into them with the gain turned all the way up which then also produced a loud buzz.I returned the item and a replacement was sent to but, that too produced the same results. Very dissapointed in this item. I just returned the second one for a full refund."
1,Awful do not purchase,"Terrible quality. Waste of money. Using more than one of the mics together generates many problems: chief among them is massive static interference when they're even remotely close to each other. The receiver's range is around 40 feet, not over 200 feet. Even at the 40 foot range, it cuts in and out."
3,Be careful,"For the price, this unit worked remarkably well. However, it is cheaply made and requires handling with kid gloves to keep from breaking."
1,Unusable,I bought these for a church production. Even with the receiver 2 meters away the headsets cut out completely when the person walked then would take 2 sec. to come back on when the person stood still. Defeats the point of wireless if you can move.
4,Pyle-pro 4400,"Needed a wireless system for our church, found this and it fit in the budget.I was pleasently suprised....the audio is nice and clear, and it has pretty goodrange. Once again a good buy for the money !"
2,All pdwm 4400 pyle pro work in same frequency,"we bought four of this Model pdwm4400 and all work in the same frequency so we have to return, because it was for the church choir and didn't work."
1,Don't waste your money,"You get what you pay for. This product performs like a hundred dollar wireless mic system. The sound breaks up; the mics are cheap and flimsy. I was hoping to get a great bargain, but instead I got frustration in a box. I could not make this work acceptably at all. No matter how I adjusted the levels it just sounded horrible. Do NOT buy this."
1,Horrible,"I am a Youth Pastor and ordered this inexpensive system for us to do children's drama and have for puppet presentations. I did not order it for superior sound quality or for singing. I understand that it is inexpensive and you get what you pay for....knew that going in however...The sound on this system is horrible to the point of being unrecognizable. We tried all 4 wireless sets, interchanged headsets, used the lapel mics, tried a totally different sound board and the voices were so garbled that you could not make out anything they said.I strongly recommend you NOT purchase this product. I had it for 2 hours fiddling with it and decided to return it. And yes, I read the instructions.I read another review here were a church purchased it for a children's play and it worked perfectly. I would like to know how....or maybe they just got a system that works. I personally will not take that chance again."
3,Not Necromunda's best but ok..,"I thought it was OK. Blood Royal with Kal Jrico had more interesting battles and a pretty good look around the underhive. Survival Instinct was alot faster with better drawn character's and left me eager for Mad' Donna's next foray. The ending here was somewhat disappointing as I wanted and kept expecting something more from the main character, like say a change to a dynamic lead, instead of a static main character. By the end I was rooting for just about everyone but the lead character. IF you haven't tried Necromunda yet, pick up Survival Instinct or Blood Royal first. You still get a look at the different levels of the hive city but the action and characters are much better paced and detailed.With that said, would I read the sequel to Salvation if there was one, maybe."
5,Hats off to a terrific book on Abe!,"This children's book has a very unique and clever focus-Abraham Lincoln's black stovepipe hat! Turns out his hat had a unique purpose-it served as a file cabinet for his little notes to himself. A lively, humorous story about our beloved 16th President!"
5,Good story.,I like this book. It is a nice story and a child appropriate introduction to one of our most famous presidents.
5,Everybody's doing the dinosaur romp!,"This has been a favorite of my three yr old grandson's ever since he was about a yr old. The rhymes, the pictures everything about this book is perfect for holding the attention of a young child. I can't wait to start reading it to his little brother! This is definitely a book I would recommend to anyone with a little one that likes singing, dancing and ""getting a little goofy""."
5,Colorful and catchy!,We read this at bedtime last night! This book is perfect to read to kids. The rhyming is catchy and fun. The watercolor artwork is bright and colorful. Highly recommended!
5,"Really fun book, you'll catch yourself singing it!","What a great book! I must confess we already owned other Tony Mitton books and Guy Parker-Rees is one of my favorite illustrators (Check out Giles Andreae's books also illustrated by him).But this book is wonderful. It's almost impossible to read with out singing/rapping by the end. It quickly became the requested book of our 2-year-old after only one or two reads.The only thing that would make it better is a little pronunciation helper for the parents. A couple of the dinosaurs are not 'common' ones you'll necessarily know.Don't hesitate, buy it now. ;-)"
5,4 year old grandson loves this book!,"Children seem to enjoy the most unique books! My grandson loved the rhyming of this book and got to where he could say the 2 line repeating rhyme on every page. He is not reading yet, but his memorization of these rhymes amazes me. We had originally taken it out of the local library. But I had to purchase this one!"
5,"Very educational, spellbinding for children","The vrrooommm series 1 2 3 provides an insite for children into the real world,not the ever present cartoon format. This series 3 different aspects: Dairy farming vegetable farming apple farming Teaching kids that their food is not just a visit to the super mkt. My grandson will watch these videos for hours at a time."
5,Everything you wanted to know about apple farming!,"Did you know that bees are an important part of growing apples? My family and I have watched this video many times and learn something new every time. The video is for all ages and describes the many aspects of growing, picking, and storing of apples. This program is fun to watch, entertaining and educational. This is my second video purchase from this vendor. It's as good or better than the dairy video."
1,One of the most awkward books I have ever handled,"This book seriously needs an update to bring it into the current century. I am trying to read it for a class at Liberty University as many others reviewing here. Just trying to keep the book in a readable state is nearly impossible. I always prefer a ""real"" book to a Kindle book, but if it were an option here, I would pick the Kindle version.Aside from that, still not enjoying this book. Old formatting, unattractive pages, overuse of superlatives.I will be very glad when this book's part of my class is over."
5,ricklewismusicdotcom,Very good book and relevant to what is going on today ... I believe every Pastor and church board elder should read this book.... A+
2,Glad I don't serve the God of this book,"I, like the previous reviewer, had to read this book for a class at Liberty University on Philosophy. The class is good, this book is awful. It seemed to me that everything had to be explained away by the author about God. No usage of Scripture when dealing with an explanation of sovereignty and his conclusion on the matter left much to be desired. I am glad that my God is not bound by my mind and that I don't need to explain God's sovereignty away to take account for my will. I would never had read it to begin with and coming away from it I feel like I know more about metaphysics than I did before but for being ""Christian"" it does leave a bad taste in my mouth."
5,Awesome Grill for the price,"This grill does exactly as promised. It can cook any normal tailgate food, but not thick steaks (due to the cover not coming down). Cant go wrong for the $. Ignighter works great, and it produces enough heat to cook partically frozen burgers in 10 degree windy weather. Grill surface and drip plan clean easily.Couple minor downsides - feet are very short, so you need a stand/table for the grill. Also there is no lip on the back of the grill, so when trying to flip burgers, they can slide against the grill top (nothing falls to the ground, but it can be a pain)."
4,I'm afraid of the grill part~,I tried out the stove with a couple of brats - the grease from the brats made the flames jump up quite a bit. I began to fear for my hands and had to keep turning it off and restarting it. Lots of grease. I'm not sure if I'm being a baby about it. Considering calling my MMA neighbor to come over and see if my manhood is in check.The burner side works well. I wish I could return it for the 2 burner model though.
4,Does the job.....,"Like most other reviewers, I was concerned about the weld burns in the bottom of the stove. In fact, I started the return process through amazon because I was so concerned. Before I shipped it back, I literally opened every unit at every retailer near my home to find the same issue. (I packed them all back up very nicely) Since I needed something for that weekend, I decided to give it a try. As a campfire cook using a campstove for the first time due to a burn ban..... Loved It. Super convenient, cooked well, cleaned up great. If it weren't for thoses pesky weld burns...... Guess we'll see how it holds up long term."
4,Not bad for an imported grill,"This grill works pretty good. It's nice to have the grill and a stove, and piezo ignition. The propane tank connection tube could be a bit sturdier, but it does not seem to leak or have a problem yet. It is made overseas, from thin guage sheet metal... not very rugged. It will probably dent very easily. The little side wind blockers are just that, wont work as a shelf for much more than a grilling utensil. Would be alot better if it was made of sturdier materials, and back here in the USA!"
3,"Great stove, only two complaints.","Cooks very well and really sips the gas. Cooked chicken, steak and brats on the grill part with great success. One can of fuel lasted through 4 twenty minute sessions. Two things: it is really hard to push the igniter and you have to brace the stove with one hand while pushing the igniter with the other. Burned my hand doing this. Also, the upright sides do not lock against the back well, and collapsed several times before I added some wire to the corners to hold them together. Overall, a good value, works well, and is very portable."
3,Good stove but could be better,"This little stove has plenty of heat and cooks fast. Sometimes too much heat, I have a large griddle which I place over both burners for pancakes for our large group. Unfortunately even on the lowest possible burner setting the heat is too high to cook pancakes properly.The grill's non-stick coating will come off if you place any pans or metal utensils on it. The gas valves are of poor design or manufacture since 95% of the heat control happens in the first 5% of valve rotation. This makes heat control is difficult and lighting the stove a little bit of a trick. Often when trying to turn the heat down the flame will go out completely forcing another tricky re-light. Once you get used to this issues it does cook well."
3,Could be better...,"The stove works pretty well but could be better for the $100 price point. The propane bottle connection is awkward and when disassembled, the connector tube doesn't store too well inside the stove.When the top is opened, it doesn't stay upright unless one of the side flaps is hooked in and the mechanism for doing that is poor at best. After the top slamming open a few times, I was ready to throw it in the woods.And the electronic ignitor... it worked as well as the one on every other BBQ grill I've owned; it lit the stove once and hasn't worked since.While the basic burner/cooking functions are fine, I had hoped for better quality but maybe I should have spent more and upgraded further; or just stuck with my 20 year old white-gas unit that still works perfectly."
4,Workhorse..so far.,"I've taken this on 3 trips in the last few weeks, and cooked 2-3x a day for several people without going through a small propane tank yet.The reviews state that the knobs are touchy, and tend to revert to ""off"" when attempting to tune in a blue flame (which, by the way, is all you should have coming off of these burners.) You get used to it.I'm satisfied and am buying the griddle accessory and a spare regulator arm. It's a big grill and can cook for many people at once. I use aluminum foil over and under the grill plate, poking a hole for the drip tray. This makes cleanup a real breeze. Being able to boil water while cooking up some bacon and sausages is a great way to start your mornings, too.This thing is my best friend."
4,Versitile cooker,The grill is coated and washable. It puts off the heat on both sides and grillin is best done on low setting. Line the pan below the grill with tinfoil for no mess bottom. Just remember to poke a hole for the grease trap and don't cover the ignitor with tinfoil. Sets up nicely and folds down conveniently with a handle to carry it. The grill seems to cook faster on the back half. It definately doesn't cook evenly on the entire surface so set the heat low and pay attention to what your grilling.
3,OK grill and stove,"Bought 2 Coleman grill and stoves on sale from Amazon for my mother in law . Compared to the older models I owned which are still working, there are more downgrades.1. The cover is not removable. It is not sturdy and the hook mechanism cannot withstand a stronger wind.2. Must use 2 hands to turn the stove on. (one hand to turn the volume knob, the other to push the ignition knob)3. The ring to attach the gas tube to the stove is slippery and hard to turn.4. The stove and grill does not come with the carrying bag and the griddle (both have to be purchased separately)Only one upgrade: The stove burner is lowered to avoid the wind."
4,Coleman stove review,"this stove has been used only once, but it appears to be very well designed, well constructed and functions well. More time and usage isneeded to see how it will hold together and continue to perform well. Thank You."
2,Keep this close to the toilet (spare paper),"Have you ever picked up a book and not been able to set it down? Don't worry, this isn't one them. Dry and ever meandering from one unrelated topic to the next, I felt confusion after just a brief reading period. Thankfully it was fairly inexpensive, and luckily for me another training book I own was able to fill the voids (and yes there are expansive voids).It's your money, but don't look here for original thoughts."
4,Classic superharp!,"Bought this 2nd hand on the fly, 3 years back. Stunning tight band driven by beautiful manic drummer and held togeher by rock steady gtr of Micky Baker . One of the best integrated small blues groups I have heard. Magnificent foil to James' ""in your face"" harp - his breaks and timing are staggering! Continual ""high energy"" road show worthy of a government health warning. Only downsides - slightly less than desirable balance for James' vocals and an over extended Flip Flop and Caledonia, the former having gob smacking first impact which wanes on repeated listening. But this is nit-picking! - listen to James playing the audience - lose yourself in the atmosphere of the night! BUY! - If anyone knows of a ""higher energy"" JC recording (live!) please let me know!"
3,great rotary read/ coffe table accessory,"if you have basic car knowledge, you'll pick up some of the general tuning tips on this book is inaccurate. but this is a revised version, so maybe something got lost in translation. however, its great on everything else you need to know.such as where your local tuning shops are and rotary only aftermarket product suppliers, etc."
1,This book is full of misinformation,"I have been racing (and winning) with RX-7s for over 10 years now, and I read all sorts of rather technical automobile racing and engineering books and articles. I think I have never seen so much misinformation in a book before. This book doesn't really get into too much technical aspects of the RX-7, and yet it is able to get many things wrong. I got so disgusted reading it that I returned the book.I was hoping for an updated version of another really good book: How to Modify Your Mazda RX-7, by Dave Emanual and Jim Downing, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The Emanual book was from the 1980s, and is unfortunately out of print. Try to track one down if you are really interested in the rotary engines and the RX-7s."
2,Accurate but basic,"I was hoping for something a little more technical, my bad.It is a good review for someone who has done little car maintenance and wishes to learn the basics.there is some surrounding information and historical story included but there are reviews elsewhere that are better."
4,Easy Listening,"I had this CD back in high school and loved it. There are two songs that I played over and over...Done to the Bone and Is it me?. My old CD does not play well after so many years of use, so I am happy I am able to replace it. I love the tone of Monteco's voice."
5,A Favorite,I bought this for my seven year old daughter for Christmas and it became a favorite. The game lists items to be found in the following picture and then you can scroll around the picture to find them. She has always enjoyed the I Spy books so I thought this may be a fun item for her. Very good purchase!
5,Laepster I Spy,This game is AWESOME!!! I got it for my four-year-old for Christmas and he has been obsessed with it. He can do it independently and loves being able to do that. It was a GREAT buy.
2,Not that great,Got several Leapster games and none of them has held the attention of my 6 year old grandson. I was really disappointed and he was too. They aren't challenging enough and much too repetitive.
3,I SPY,MY 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER RECEIVED THIS ITEM AS WELL AS MATH MISSION FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE LIKED IT BUT BECAME FRUSTRATED DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS A LITTLE OVER HER HEAD AND IT WAS HARD TO USE THE PEN WITH IT. OVER ALL ME AND MY 9 YEAR OLD SON LIKED IT. THE PICTURES AND THE SPEAKING ARE CLEAR.
3,I spy,"I had to return it because my nephews already had the game, but I think Leapster products are very outstanding."
3,hmmmmm,This game was interesting to say the least. i tried playing it with my daughter and all it was is a bunch of matching objects and other things like that. i expected it to be like most I spy gamess and you have to look for an object not match the object. she has only played this game once and has not even asked for it again.
4,I Spy Challenge Review,"I purchased this game for my son since he enjoys the I Spy series books and for the most part he enjoys the game, although his initial reaction was that the game is not challenging enough?"
1,Description says it comes with flowers....it does not! Not worth the price.,"I sent this as a get well gift, took 2 weeks to get there, and their were not flowers with the basket. I wish I had just called a local florist."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this for my wife. The contents of the package were old and the cookies were rancid. She called Amazon and they gave a credit, but said to keep it as it could not be returned...it was thrown away as she felt that the contents were not safe to eat. What a dispointment!"
5,They loved it.,This gift was well recieved. They loved it and were very happy. It is a nice size for gifting. Would order this again.
5,Egg Artist's choice,I am a Pysanky Artist and love this product for showing pieces of a common theme. Well made they enhance the beauty of my pieces.
3,I think it's cool.,"This is a fun dvd and despite the only other customer review I bought it anyway.It's a two dvd set,the first disc has two movies one is Lady Frankenstein wich stars Joseph Cotten (lattitude zero,soylent green)and suprisenly some nudie scenes. The other movie is Jesse James meets Frankenstein wich is why I purchased the dvd in the first place.The title alone attracted me.The second disc has an interesting documentry wich focuses on Mary Schelly's life and a bunch of trailers from the Frankenstein brand including universals original Franky and other lesser ones like Frankenstein vs. The Space monster.Pick it up used it's worth the few bucks."
3,"Objective, Interesting and Somewhat Informative.","A collection of 10 essays by Tully, this book presents some of the facets of Indian life in a very objective manner. Certainly, the content reflects the fact that Tully understands India as well as any Indian. He covered mostly politics and religion only. The books includes a few pictures too."
4,Great Price and Looks Great,"Works very well at holding magazines, and it looks great sitting next to my recliner. The only bad thing was the color; in the picture it looks like a dark cherry wood color, but it is very very dark brown, practically black."
4,Good quality item,Very good quality item. Looks nice and serves the purpose of storing 10-12 magazines. I wish it had more space in those vertical compartments. The drop leaf certainly is an add-on bonus.
3,All is well.,I bought this magazine rack for my salon. It is not REALLY high quality but it will serve the purpose. The leaf is a little stiff but quite functionable.
1,disappointment,"This item was purchased through Amazon as a gift. The magazine rack arrived properly packaged, but the table top fell off after removing it from the box. Screws were missing from the table and there were some nicks in the wood. It appeared that the item was packed damaged and not due to shipping. It was a hassle to repack and haul to the post office for return. My refund took 2 weeks."
2,Deceptive color description and Picture.,Why not describe this piece as gloss black finish. The picture shown is more of a cherrywood look which is why I purchased it. The construction is ok. What I would expect for the price. But the black gloss paint finish is not what is shown in the picture.
3,not what I expected,"It is not dark brown as the picture shows. Its actually black.There was only one hinge screwed in. The other was in the box with no screws.Lucky that my husband had similar screws. No return slip in the box either, so I could not send it back, or give it as a gift as I had intended. So now I have it."
5,"Beautiful, solid table","This table is quality made and required NO assembly. It is short, perfect for next to a chair. The color is rich and the wood is nice. I was a little leary of the quality because of the low price, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very happy with this product and price."
1,Only as a comedy,"Incredibly poorly edited, poorly produced, ugly as hell. We got a few belly laughs but lots of wincing. She looked irritated as she urged us to ""relax"". She could easily be Andrea Martin on SCTV."
2,These pages are available in a better book,"This book consists of silhouettes and photos of various pottery forms. Very interesting design resource.However, a better buy would be Neal French's ""The Potter's Encyclopedia of Color, Form and Decoration: The Comprehensive References for Today's Ceramicist"". It includes the exact contents of this book, along with Constant & Ogden's ""Potter's Palette"", along with some pages of additional decoration photos. (For that reason I'm giving this one only two stars)."
4,"Great, comprehensive survey of the technology","There are about two or three must-reads out there if you want to understand broadband access at a high level. This is one of them.Kim Maxwell's ""Residential Broadband"" is fantastic but a bit opinionated -- it doesn't even mention ANY wireless local loop solutions, for example. And it doesn't cover passive optical networks. Mr. Black's text is more comprehensive. It's an easy-to-read survey text which is an excellent introduction to the field.It does use some technical lexicon and is not for the innumerate; go read books in the Microsoft Library if you want a ""for Dummies"" type book. Mr. Black defines the terms he uses very clearly, but does not pause to provide context for the reader. If you're an engineer or just a geek, you'll love this."
2,Needs an editor,The book is a collection of material that appears to have been assembled in a hurry and not proof-read. Its incoherence probably mirrors the state of the industry when the book was published. There is no glossary and the index is so-so. There are better and more recent books available.
3,2 short stories.,"Some of Mr. Paine's earlier works and neither of the stories up to par with his later works like Open Range, Skye and The New Mexico Heritage, the first story ""The Silent Outcast"" is about an ex army cavalry scout saving a wagon train from an indian massacre is less than 30 pages long, the second story ""Guns in the Desert"" may have been the basis for his Sheridan Township series with a middle aged sheriff and two or more older friends in the gunshop and saddlery/harness business, defending their small town against a savage outlaw gang, still a better story than a lot of other writer's culled stories."
5,Pistols Review on this CD,A must for any Pistols fan. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition ! Thank you so much !!!!
5,It's no swindle!,"This is a great addition to any Sex Pistols collection. The Pistols only had a certain amount of recorded songs, so this adds a few more you can't get anywhere else along with some really silly covers. Eat Me!"
3,anarchy in the punk record,"The Great Rock N Roll Swindle is itself a headlong swindle to the people who could take the project seriously - that is to say, an album long endorsement of the idea that Malcolm McLaren strongarmed the idea of punk music. In it, there's plenty of nose-thumbing aberrations like an orchestral ""EMI,"" or the willfully grating ""Who Killed Bambi,"" enough so that the whole project can easily be dismissed as completely indulgent. However, a handful of fist-pumping songs prove that, despite any arguments to the contrary, music wouldn't have survived without the Pistols - ""What You Gonna Do About It,"" the Sid Vicious ""My Way,"" and even the title track have nearly as much spit in them as actual Pistols songs."
4,this is really weird!,"this cd is only for those of you who love the pistols,as much as i do!and you have to have a sense of humor too. i love the way johnny rotten sings johnny b goode! there are some funny songs along with great classics,like anarky in the uk! i really liked dont gimme no lip, and im not your stepping stone is my fav,& silly thing, the most laughable were: sid's cover of my way,rock around the clock is simple the funniest thing ive ever heard,so is who killed bambi,you really have to listen to it yourself to pick out the great tunes,so get it already!"
3,Swindle indeed!,"This album is incredibly hit or miss. Some of the material, like the version of Anarchy in the UK (referred to as ""L'Anarchy Pour le UK) is indispensible. Other parts are orchestral music from the film--hardly what the average Pistols fan is looking for."
4,It's the essential +,It has most of the good tunes by the sex pistols and the other ones that are not really good are at least funny and can be heard without being irritated by the music. The best song is oviously in there and it couldn't be cut out because it's a classic of course I am talking about anarchy in the u.k. All and all it's a pretty good sountrack
3,Uneven But Fun,"This album contains a bit of something for everyone, although hardcore Pistols fans may be somewhat disappointed. However, despite the inclusion of some dreadful material (most notably Ten Pole Tudor), there are some rare and entertaining tracks. Sid Vicious renders an hilarious version of ""My Way"", and turns in surprisingly good renditions of two Eddie Cochran classics. The Pistols' botched efforts on ""Johnny B. Goode"" and ""Road Runner"" are quite amusing, and fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs gets in on the action (and steals the show) with ""No One Is Innocent"" and ""Belsen Vas A Gassa"", and does both rather well. The rest is somewhat spotty, ranging from great to awful, but the good parts of the album are worth the price of admission. Get this one - it's great fun."
2,practically a novelty album,"""Never mind the bollocks"" has 4 awesome songs with the remainder being fair to good. Overall, it deserves to be a classic rock album. Historically, its just a stripped down, raw, hard rock album... which is good!This has outtakes, which are inferior to ""Bollocks"", some Sid Vicious songs (he had no talent) and some bizzaro foreign language, symphonic versions of Pistols songs. It may have been very appropriate as a soundtrack to the movie, but as a pure musical work... its goofy.The exception is Roadrunner and Stepping Stone, pure gems."
5,Brilliant,"Although it has been billed as the ""other Sex Pistols album"", it is really the soundtrack to the film of the same title. Honestly, most of the thick necked thug punks won't get this album. If they listen to it without watching the movie, they'll hate it. If they have watched the movie and listened to it afterwards, they'll still hate it and on top of that, be confused, especially if they are American punks who can't decipher the thick British accents on the film. But the concept behind it is brilliant in my opinion, even though Malcolm McLaren (Pistol's manager) turns out in real life to be close to his on screen persona (one reason why many would be fans are turned off) the film and the album is still an amusing look into the media sensationalized run of the Sex Pistols in the UK way back when. If you get, you'll really get it and ultimately enjoy it thoroughly. Yes Malcom was an arse and the Pistols are a bit of a swindle themselves. But get over it. It's still good stuff."
2,The title defines the album: It's a swindle!,"The film was not more than ""interesting"", and the album worths for 2 or 3 classic songs + some jokes like ""Who killed Bambi?"" and the french/disco versions of ""Anarchy in the UK"", which certainly won't make you laugh when you hear for the 20th time."
1,The title says it all,"The Sex Pistols should only be remembered for their excellent debut album 'Never Mind the Bollocks'. This follow up album is quite simply dire and shows clearly the limitations of the band. 'Friggin in the riggin' was worth making and 'Silly thing' would have been good if they could have found some one better than Paul Cook to sing it. The French version of 'Anarchy' is quite amusing. But overall this is just a commercial rip-off from a band that had entirely run out of ideas. Even at their height the Sex Pistols were never as good as the Clash, Stiff Little Fingers or the Stranglers but this second album should never have been recorded. If you like punk don't bother with this pile of garbage..."
2,Not A True Sex Pistols album!,"This album should be credited to Malcolm Mclaren and the Blowaves, not the Sex Pistols. Apart from the early John Rotten tracks and the Sid Vicious tracks this is utterly useless drivel!Not Punk, Not Rock, Not even good comedy. YAWN!!!!"
3,A few gems amid the dross,"Q: How do you fill a double album for your movie when your lead singer/sole songwriter leaves the band? A: You fill said albums with every piece of filler you can find. And hope the remaining members of the group can contribute something in the way of songs. That in a nutshell is the Great Rock & Roll Swindle Soundtrack. Surprisingly guitarist Steve Jones (along with drummer Paul Cook) come up with a couple of gems: Silly Thing, and the title track. No One Is Innocent has blasting guitar from Jones but is marred by weak vocals from train robber Ronnie Biggs. The title track is also affected by an audition for lead singer by a number of aspirants. Sid Vicious sings My Way and a couple of Eddie Cochran songs. A couple of old Johnny Rotten tracks along with a great deal of drivel fill out the album sides.OK but could have been much better"
2,Swindle indeed,"The cover of ""(I'm not your) Stepping Stone"" is one of my favorite cover songs by anyone. I haven't listened to anything else on the album for several years.If you like Sid singing ""My Way"", then, fine, buy it for that, too. I don't care for it. The addition of Sid to the band wasn't a good thing as far as I'm concerned.The cover of ""Roadrunner"" is the second best song on the album, but you are better served by getting the Modern Lovers original."
4,"Remarkable Book, Remarkable People","This is a remarkable book because the survivors themselves tell their stories of survival. More than that, though, the author gives the context of the ""before,"" ie., the lives of these people before the Nazi takeover of Czechoslovakia. That adds to the drama of the accounts given by the survivors. Then there is the aftermath, the camaraderie that helped these young men survive continues to this day and is at the core of the relationships that helped them triumph over this terrifying ordeal."
1,There Are Better Books Out There,I was disappointed with this book. I found it to be mostly out of date and very dry and difficult to get through. It also is missing a key part of any guide book: a map. I thought the illustrations were very poorly done... just childish line drawings where photographs would've been much better. I'd say skip this one and get the lonely planet one instead.
1,"Constipation + Sucrose = No, thanks!","You think you're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula. Sadly, that's not the case here. This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed. Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it. With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organic's sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes. Check the NY Times article for more info on this.Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term, possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no, thanks!"
5,Awesome Similac Organic Formula,"I was NEVER going to give my children formula... after my first child was born I did not produce enough milk and had to supplement. We tried all different types of formula from many name brands. Unfortunately he had adverse reactions to everything we tried, including soy products. We finally tried Organic Similac. This was by far the most expensive, so we started with the powder. This stayed down & he didn't have any reactions (rashes, hives, throwing up, etc). After a couple of months he began spitting up a little powdery substance (guess we didn't mix well enough). We then tried the Premixed Similac Organic. Voila! Perfect. No adverse reactions, he was happy & healthy.We've had 2 more children & both have also used the Premixed Organic Similac. Neither of them have had an problem with the formula & according to the Doctor they are all very healthy children. To me that is what's most important. :)"
1,"Great product, but price-gouged b/c of shortage","This is a great product... my baby loves it. I especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly.I am, however, rating this low because of the SELLER... $55 is RIDICULOUS! This product normally sells for $25-$32. But they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall.YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AMAZON!!!! This is food for a BABY! Makes me ill."
1,Garbage!!,"Do not buy this product. You will not be doing your infant any favors. If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding. (I know it's not always easy or convenient.) If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing. Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then ""fortify"" with synthetic vitamins/minerals. Pathetic. Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible. There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk. Sorry to be so matter of fact. I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the ""green"" movement. OH and by the way the second ingredient in this garbage is sugar!!! Good way to start the diabetes/obesity while they're young!"
1,constipation,we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves. it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake. we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now. her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal
1,shipping time is unreasonably long,"i ordered this on 8/29/10, and it didn't ship out until three and a half weeks later. it's 10/12/10 and i still haven't received it yet. next time, i plan to order from a merchant who can fulfill it in a reasonable timeframe.as far as the product is concerned, i do like that the similac liquid formula in the 32oz size doesn't contain BPA. i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single-use ready-made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain BPA. i would expect more diligence from similac to be BPA-free in all of their packaging."
1,Horribly Constipating,My child was exclusively breastfed for 4 1/2 months and I gradually introduced Similac Organic formula to supplement (my breastmilk started to dry up). She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1/2 months. By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched. She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball. It was horrible! I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula. I say switch....
1,reviewing hot target,This book has to be one of the worst books that I have ever attempted to read. I'm a prolific reader and I found it impossible to maintain any interest . There was no plot that I could see...the writing was sophmoric at best and I had to throw the book in the trash after struggling through about thirty pages. How and why a publisher put this book on the market is a mystery to me.
2,Missed the bullseye :-(,"I'm a huge Suz fan ... but I really think she missed the boat on this one. Her style has changed since she moved to hardcover & this book just fell flat for me. The secondary storyline or FBI agent Jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple Cosmo & Jane. Didn't like her at all & Cosmo lost his ""Seal-ness"" somewhere along the way. Not a re-read for me."
2,Glad I didn't pay hardcover price,"I LOVE Suzanne Brockmann's writing. If she were any other author, I'd give it 1 star. This one just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the heroine Jane (who seemed irritating & immature) and I didn't care about Cosmo (i guess the character development was lacking). I couldn't identify with the gay FBI agent and the intern chasing the in-the-closet actor storyline was a flat out bore. I read romance for escape - one of the last things I want to do is escape into a homosexual love story. I never finished her last book (an extremely disappointing read - the one abt the CIA agents). I don't know if i'm going to finish this one. I certainly hope Max & Gina's story doesn't follow this pattern of poorly developed characters."
2,A Big Disappointment,"After being obsessed with the other Brockmann books, this was such a letdown. None of the main characters were likable, let alone sexy. Cosmo went from a big, tough mystery in previous books to a show tune singing, big ball of insecurities. Jane's trash talk during what should have been sexy scenes, made the scenes unbearable. I liked Jules as a support character in the previous books, but I don't want to read about homosexual relationships. If I did, I would pick a different genre of books to read. I anxiously await the stories about Max and Gina and Decker and Sofia. Get to the good stuff Suzanne!"
2,Not what I wanted,If I wanted a book about gay lovers I would have picked a book about them. I was into the series and enjoyed reading Suzanne Brockmanns books but did not appreciate the introduction of gay relationship aspect of the story. I loved Jane and Cosmo and the story that involved their relationship.
2,Disappointing.......Again,"Ms. Brockmann's last two books don't begin to compare with her earlier works. This was supposed to be Cosmo's book, but the lack of character development and the fluff plot revolving around Cosmo and Jane Chadwick made the book easy to put down. Cosmo, always mysterious in prior books, is just too perfect to be believable and Jane falls back on the old cliche of using her sex appeal to obtain success.Jules, a favorite character of mine, steals the book, but I fail to believe an intelligent, experienced FBI agent would put up with the behavior of either of his potential love interests, Adam or Robin.Sad to say, Ms. Brockmann is no longer an automatic buy for me. I'll be happy to wait for the local library to stock her books."
5,Loved it!,"I was so delighted to read a book where Jules was a prominent character. I'd been hoping the time would come and it did! This book did not disappoint at all. I fell in love with Cosmo and was completely enthralled with the romance between him and Jane. I loved their arguments. In true Brockmann style, the characters are multi-dimensional, completely believable, utterly compelling. The writing is captivating and exceptional. I read this book in a day and usually it takes me weeks to read a book of this length.I know a lot of reviewers didn't like Cosmo, but he's one of my favorite Brockmann heroes and the fact that his story is intertwined with Jules (which I've been waiting for) makes this book nearly my favorite. (It's hard to beat"
5,Hot Target by Suzanne Brockmann,Another great book in this amazing series! I loved all of the twists and turns and romance and surprises! I also loved the fact that Suzanne included a gay storyline in to her book. A lot of authors don't do that but she did. It's nice to see an author portray gays in a positive light and show others that they are just normal people like everyone else. I also loved her dedication to her son. I think that it is wonderful that she accepts him for who he is. I wish more people could be like that. Good job Suzanne! :)
1,Disappointing,"I usually love SB's books but I was really disappointed in this book. There were so many characters and plots in this book I kept getting lost and having to go back and check out the story. The gay plot was no problem, but I think Jules got short changed. I liked Decker and Sophia and hope they have a book in the future. I also enjoyed Jack's character. Cosmo and Jane were short changed in this story. I hope her next one will be better(...)."
2,Hot Target,"After waiting for this latest Navy SEAL book to come out I was very very disappointed with this latest story from Suzanne Brockmann who has always previously delivered exciting adventures complete with every woman's ideal hero. However, after reading all her other books I felt Cosmo Richter was not given the strong character image he deserved and felt extremly annoyed on his behalf. Jules Cassidy was the only saving grace to be found to lift the story. I did enjoy the way he was written even if he did'nt have a happy conclusion this time around - hopefully the next story will see him finding someone worthy of him and also bring back the magic to the rest of the characters."
3,Review of Abridged Audio Edition Only,"A man and a woman read alternate sections of the book. It stands to reason that this arrangement would add considerably to the listener's enjoyment, providing a richer, more complex experience. Judging by the large number of books he's read, Patrick Lawlor seems to be fairly well liked. Melanie Ewbank has read only four.Wow, am I out of sync with the rest of the universe! I think Mr. Lawlor's voice lacks in the right timbre and pitch for the material. However, Ms. Ewbank's voice is fluid, easy, and graceful; she's terrific. As a listener, I found the shifts between the two readers to be exasperating. It contributed nothing to the story. If a rationale exists for who read which section, I didn't discern it.For the gold standard for a man and woman reading romance, listen to Dick Hill and susie Breck read ""Soft Focus""."
2,Not Brockmann's best . . .,"Kudos to Brockmann for her sensitivity to Jules, Robin and Adam. Her character development of Jules was terrific. He's a character you'd love to hug and have for a friend.I was very disappointed in the remainder of the book. Cosmo's character development was way below Brockmann's usual treatment given to her main character(s). I found the entire story line and lack of emotional depth to Cosmo's ""dangerous"" past unbelievable and, quite frankly, distracting to the story line surrounding Jules.With over forty books to her credit, Brockmann is ""allowed"" to have one or two that miss the mark and it seems to me that the last two, Flashpoint, and now, Hot Target, fall into a substandard category. I hope she gets back ""on target"" with Max and Gina's book!"
5,Brockmann is Brillian in Hot Target!,"SEAL Team Sixteen's stoic Chief Cosmo Richter takes a month of leave when his mother breaks both her wrists in a freak falling accident. After just a few days of listening to musical soundtracks, Cosmo is anxious to get back to work. He moonlights for Tom Paoletti's Troubleshooters, Inc. and is promptly thrown into the role of big bad bodyguard. The body he guards?... none other than beautiful, sexy J. Mercedes Chadwick, a Hollywood producer who is currently receiving death threats for her production of a WWII movie featuring a very powerful love story between two male soldiers. Cosmo and Jane have immediate chemistry, although Cosmo is unsure of why"
4,Loved it...,"I have to agree with some other people who reviewed this book, this book was more about Jules, Robin and Adam and I LOVED IT!I hope for Jules and Robin that there is a happy end....Jane was a funny character too, Cosmo the usual silent-SEAL-type guy but not really the focus of the story. The ""side-story"" about Jules was very heartfelt and I think that's it what makes Mrs. Brockmann a great writer. Can't wait for Max's and Ginas story...."
1,Ick,"Well, the winning streak with the SEALS is definitely over. No one in this book I would care to get to know better."
2,Used to be a fan,"I used to be a big SB fan and I've read everything that she's ever written. Her last book was sub-par, but this one was really bad. This has absolutely nothing to do with the gay storyline. It was simply poorly written. The characters are not believable, nor are they well-developed. They almost seem like cardboard cut-outs. Jules has always been one of my favorite characters - witty, cute, supportive - now suddenly every second line is about how people will react to his being gay. It was overdone. We didn't know a lot about Cosmo before this book, and we still don't (other than the fact that everyone that he meets thinks that he has weird eyes). The storyline was really thin, and quite frankly, I was bored! I would gladly wait another 6 months in between novels for an exciting read."
3,"Good read, but not as good as previous one","Well there is no doubt Jule has completely stolen the show, which I do not mind at all. I have always liked his character in previous books and the trangle relationship between him, Robin and Adam is heartfelt and grabbed my attention from start to end. SB's protrait of their struggles, confusion, fear, and hurt is so well done that I feel they are real and want to know them better. I only hope there will be more of Jule's story in the future. The reason I only gave 3 starts to this book is because I just cannot bring myself to feel connected with Jane. She came off as selfish in the first half ane whinning in the second half (sort of like Joan in Into the Night). I like Cosmo but feel he deserves a better woman than Jane. I think the weakest part of this book is the lack of character development in Cosmo and Jane."
4,Enjoyable,"I have read enough Brockman to pick up a book if it has her name on it, but I haven't read many other books in this series, so for the most part, I can't say whether it's better or worse than most of them. However, it is very entertaining, well written, well plotted, and has interesting characters. Some people expecting a straight hetero romance/suspense tale might be a bit put off by the gay relationships in the book; personally, I think they added depth and breadth to the novel. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the reader engaged until the end, so this novel is definitely recommended."
5,"4 years, still my best purchase EVER!!!!","I bought these, both black for pepper and white for sea salt. BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!! Not only is the grind perfect, but the fact that the grinder is on top, AND YOU HAVE A COVER FOR THE TOP, the BEST!!! Can not go wrong on this purchase, if you are a foodie, and love the best, this is the best!! I would have paid EASILY $50.00 PLUS for each. You will not be disappointed. ENJOY!!"
5,Great grinder for grill spices,"I bought this grinder because I have some mesquite grill spices that came in a cheap mill with plastic teeth. That worked fine for about the first 1/5 of the spices, but it was gradually grinding less & less. I put those spices in this mill, and it grinds them great; not to a powder, and no chunks, just the right amount. It takes a bit more force to turn it, but that's because it's grinding so much more, and more quickly. So far, the teeth are still working like they did on the first day. I highly recommend it. The only thing is that the cap doesn't hinge, it just pops off, but I guess then it's not in the way of the falling spices, so that's probably for the best."
2,Disappointed,"I use unground Celtic Sea Salt and purchased this salt grinder in hopes it would grind my salt to make it easier for use. It is not efficient, just doesn't work, and would discourage anyone buying it for this particular salt."
5,My Kyocera ceramic salt mill,I am very happy with my fairly recent purchase of the Kyocera ceramic fine mill. I use course Celtic sea salt and the mill does a fantastic job of grinding it for seasoning our family meals. I was looking for a mill that would last but not cost an arm and a leg; I found it in the Kyocera.
3,Ok to grind flax seeds but not rosemary springs,"The flax seeds ground enough to add to recipes and oatmeal. However, if you wanted to grind more that a tablespoon it is a tedious task."
1,Does NOT work for wet salt!,"Very, very dissappointed with this mill. After about 100 turns we were able to get about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt. And there is no mechanism to force the salt to the grinder. Poorly designed. Very likey another product in which you get what you pay for...I'll probably try the Puegot Vendome wet mill instead. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Save your money!,"I've owned several of these grinders for a couple of years now; out of the 8 I bought, I have 3 that are still in one piece. The problems? The rotating grinder heads have all broken laterally. They also have a quality control problem in that the same sized grinding heads do not grind the same. In short, a good idea with third-rate manufacturing materials holding the ceramic."
3,Kyocera mill,"Arrived in excellent condition, all well. Transaction excellent. However, no fault of the seller, I have noticed with this type of mill that some of what you have just ground falls back into the container when you set it down. If you are seeking freshly ground pepper, etc, eventually the jar is half full of pepper or spice you ground earlier, maybe even weeks earlier. The kind of mill with the grinder on the bottom, which unfortunately has a tendency to leave a ring of ground stuff on your counter/table, does not do this."
2,Disappointing results,"I bought this to grind various spices but have been very disappointed with the results. It just doesn't seem to grind very well and even with the jar half full the spices wouldn't fall into the grinding area meaning I was doing lots of turning without anything happening. This was the case with various sizes of spices. Maybe I just got a bad one, but this will be going in the yard sale pile."
4,Works well with Celtic Sea Salt,"I order this mill because it was ceramic. I use it to grind Celtic Sea Salt that is damp. Read reviews saying that it had to be turned 100 times etc. I found 4-5 turns salts my eggs just fine. There is a 'right' direction that grinds and if you turn it the wrong way it does nothing. Been using it for a month now.I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the grind is as described - fine, I'd say very fine. I'd like it to be a tad more course."
1,Not good for Celtic Sea Salt,This grinder does not work on unprocessed Celtic Sea Salt.It works no better/no worse than other grinders on pepper.
1,Obtuse and opaque tome,"The main thrust of this textbook is soliton theory and examples in plasma physics. There is some additional material borrowed from fluid dynamics, but the flavor is still plasmas. This text is very analytic. The derivations are often hard or impossible to follow, and the authors seem to assume general familiarity with plasma physics. I don't have that familiarity, so I found the choice of topics covered and the ensuing theory ad hoc and unmotivated. This is the kind of text where you can spend an enormous amount of time grinding through it, and at the end of the day come away with very litte applicable knowledge."
1,Strange Packaging,I ordered this product and what I received was not the item pictured. Instead I received the almonds in a ZIP LOC bag and is apparent that it is not professionally packaged. Looks like someone had some almonds and threw them in a ZIP LOC bag and sent them to me. I have tried to contact the seller with zero results. I left negitive feedback as well. I want the item pictured not a ZIP LOC bag from who knows where. Stay away from this company.
4,Great Nuts!,Delicious! These nuts arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. I would recommend this product and supplier.
1,Very Unprofessional,Vulcan is absolutely right. I ordered this product and received it in a ziploc bag as well. Do not recommend that anyone order this product.
1,raw almonds,I mistakeningly ordered raw almonds. I can roast them and they will be fine. Had a digesting them. Love the raw taste but just don't have good luck with them.
3,Cute for the avid fisherman,"I bought this for my dad who happens to really enjoy fishing. It's very cute! I wouldn't go so far to say it's made out of really high quality materials, but without playing with it, it will last for awhile."
2,"Good looking, but replace the crystal","A common theme in several of the Skagen watch reviews was broken crystals. Mine broke twice--the only crystals I remember breaking in some 40 years of watch wearing. The first time I paid Skagen to fix it. After the second time, I sent an email to customer service asking what was going on. No response. Eventually I took the watch to a repair place in LA. They said that Skagen no longer made that watch or crystal, and that the design of the latter was defective. The watch repair shop replaced it with a new crown that they made--it's flat and they said it should break as often (or as infrequently!) as any other crown."
4,Excellent for what it is,"I had high hopes for this album considering it was recorded between Meddle and Dark Side of the Moon. The songs are varied and pretty peculariar, actually. the album starts off with a cool synth dirge, Obscured by Clouds. then it kicks into an annoying instrumental, When You're In. i hate this song, it's one generic riff over and over. then again, it was just meant to accompany a movie, so it's understandable. Burning Bridges is Meddle-esque, mellow and soothing. Waters and Gilmore exchange vox and it turns out to be one of the better tracks. The Gold It's In the... is a straightforward rock song with a ripping Gilmore solo. Mudmen turns out to be my favorite track on the whole cd. Mason uses a simple, driving beat to propell an introspective, melancholy tune that's great for reflection. Childhood's end is one of the Floyd's best songs ever, a testament to Gilmore's abilities. This album is essential for the hardcore PF fan. It's pretty relaxing."
4,Soundtrack Floyd is Better Than More,"There are enough cuts on this film soundtrack album(La Vallee) to justify it a higher rating than that other soundtrack they did(MORE).Title track kicks, Mudmen is awesome, Free Four is reminiscent of the Barret days.Stay is a light, mellow tune.Some people complain about Absolutely Curtains, but this one is trippy."
3,Not truly Floyd,"Listening to Obscured by Clouds, one doesn't get the feeling they're listening to Pink Floyd. This album sounds more like an imitation of the Beatles and any dozen other bands from the era. Compared to Atom Heart Mother or Saucerful of Secrets, this is a disappointing Floyd album. Recommended for true believers only."
3,Modest,"No one is going to mistake the music found on Obscured By Clouds for the innovative kind found on other Pink Floyd albums. While it certainly lacks the usual Pink Floyd punch, it's not hard to hear how the atmostphering sounds lead by David Gilmour's electric guitar have let my CD collection embrace this modest album."
4,although I'm no fan this is an OK CD,"Although I am not a Froyd fan I like this album.Best track is DEFANATELY : ABSOLUTELY CURTAINS with the hypnotic vchanting, beautiful I wish it only lasted an entire side.Other good tracks when you're in, mudmen, obscured by clouds.worst song : 3,4 - rather childish.maybe the best thing about this album is the atmosphere, tempting, congruent and favorite over many of their later works.Definately buy this, you will not regret, it is a winner album."
4,FLOYD produces another quality album,"I just finished listening to Obscured for the firt time and wish I'd bought it sooner. Though not all of it has that Floyd sound most newer fans know, it showcases why Floyd fans are Floyd fans. Listen to the instrumental mudmen and the equally adept wot's...uh the deal and you'll be instantly drawn in. Like the earlier Meddle and Saucerful of Secrets they prove their musicianship in lyric and music witing. A friend of mine gave me Pulse a few years ago but I wasn't really into Floyd. In the last 13 months I've bought eleven Floyd albums including Saucerful, Ummagumma, Meddle and their more well known WYWH, Animals & the Wall. I won't get into the Waters/Gilmour controversey except to say that if you don't listen to each album on its own then you'll never get what Floyd is. Try them all and become a true Pink Floyd fan."
4,tremendous music,"This is a great album , it's not really pink floydish music but it's great , in somo tracks you wouldnt know it was pink floyd except for waters voice , the instrumental songs are very good and catchy especially when youre in and they actually rock in a few tracks like the gold its in the... a little more commercial than the other floyd albums but it's cool anyway , my favorites are childhood's end and wot's uh the deal the other ones are great too."
4,"Good album, not enough jams","I enjoy this album immensly. The lyracs are great and Gilmours voice hardly ever sounds better. The only problem is that the songs aren't very long. I am a big fan of epic jams like ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" and ""Echoes."" It would be nice if there was continuation of some songs. ""Mudmen"" has potential to have a sick Jam but doesn't take the oppurtunity. As far as Ballads go, ""Stay"" is up there with ""Wish you were here."" The album came from a great time in the Floyd Timeline but it seems to have been released at the same time as darkside. I recomend to any hardcore floyd fan that this be a part of your collection."
5,More than a soundtrack album,"This was the first PF album I owned on cassette when I was a kid. Since then it still remained one of my favourites. Don't bother with Momentary or Division Bell, get albums from this PF-era first, U cannot go wrong with it!"
4,good trippy stuff,"While it offers only a bit of the intrigue heard on Meddle, Obscured By Clouds offers pure, psychedelic jams straight from the lava lap. Surely practicing surrealism as they did on this LP gave them an implement by which to showcase, script and score the most unique and artistic looks at society and life in their next few years. The very memorable tracks include the ambient forerunners Obscured By Clouds and Mudmen, the drifting yet melodic Burning Bridges, the cold and grim Childhood's End and the finale, Absolutely Curtains which displays the Floydian weirdness of eerie, trippy notes and mysterious sound effects, heard on Careful With That Axe Eugene and Embryo. While it hass little as revolutionary as Floyd's next album (even though I consider this a good example on the subject of Pink Floyd's role in formulating ambient music), Obscured By Clouds is ten good songs written in an enjoyable style which the band has obviously become well disciplined in."
1,Overrated album,"If the name Pink Floyd wasn't on this cd, who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ? I am a Pink Floyd fan, but I have to say that I don't like any of their early works. To me, the band begins to make great stuff with ""Meddle"" and their first cd were boring, even with the Pink Floyd name on it. The only good track is ""Childhood's end"", the other tracks are poor."
1,Stink Floyd,"I wouldn't waste much time on this. It can't compare at all with Dark Side of the Moon; it's hard to believe the band that wrote and performed Dark Side is the same band on this album. The only thing interesting about this album is how it may add evidence to the theory of a meaningful connection between Dark Side and the movie ""The Wizard of Oz."" The band had an opportunity to put music to a movie shortly before making Dark Side. Anyway, Obscured by Clouds is the only Pink Floyd album I have that I doubt I'll ever listen to again."
4,Pretty good album,"This is an overall enjoyable album from the Floydmeisters, with a very trippy sound and good songwriting. However, was ""Absolutely Curtains"" necessary? The song is apparently just filler, and serves no real purpose. It definitely doesn't bring the album together. Would have been a five star album with a better song to tie the album together."
4,Shine on you crazy Diamond In the Rough!,"Some people who claim to be Pink Floyd 'fans' haven't even heard of this album! Their loss!! This is a very good set of Pink Floyd songs, all of which are very short by Floyd standards...no 15-20 minute ramblers here. That is what helps make this album unique, all without losing any quality! A collection of 4-6 minute, good rock/pop songs...songs that are still distictly Pink Floyd. I highly recommend this album without reservation."
3,3.5 Stars,"Pink Floyd doesn't like to make things easy, I guess, so before jumping into what many consider their masterpieces, they took another trip down film-scoring lane. While an improvement over their earlier efforts in this area, the scoring leads to a less than cohesive album...one dictated by the events in the film, rather than the thoughts of the band's writers...and it suffers for it."
5,Underrated,"Most pre Dark Side of The Moon albums except Meddle were very hippie and experimrntal.This was an exception, it wasn't to experimental, it was diffrent though. It was more of a raw sound and a very good soundtrack. Don't mistake, Pink Floyd was always a good band it's just that this album was very exceptional and sounded so good I that I had to tell you all.BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC, NOT ROCK MUSIC, ANY MUSIC AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU DON'T LIKE MUSIC...THEN YOU ARE SAD"
5,...for the instrumentals alone!,"this is a great floyd cd.it's weird how the instrumental tracks actually outshine the ones with vocals,however.any fan of pink has to hear the song ""mudmen""-one of the most relaxingly uplifting songs ever by anybody.it's just an all-around classic pink floyd cd with no filler cuts,and no egotistical crap."
2,Pink Floyd - 'Obscured By Clouds' (Capitol) 2 1/2 stars,"Review no.107.Originally released in 1972,this was Floyd's seventh lp(including compilations).'Obscured...' have never been one of my favorite Pink Floyd albums,although I'm not saying it's a bad effort.It's different than any other of their works.Sort of thought the CD's instrumentals,like the title cut ""Obscured By Clouds"",""When You're In"" and ""Absolutely Curtain"" were decently played.Even kind of liked the somewhat funky ""Childhood's End"",their ballad ""Burning Bridges"" and maybe even ""Wot's...Uh The Deal"".As a whole,this record JUST doesn't do much for me.Pink Floyd fanatics would probably get more out of it than I did.Hear it for yourself."
2,"A Slight, country-ish Floyd","The soundtrack for an EXTREMELY obscure European art film, ""Obscurred by Clouds"" has a few interesting songs on it, of which ""Free Four"" is probably the best. The is none of the artistry or vision that Floyd would command later on in their career. Recommended for die hard fans only."
4,"A few awesome songs, a few average ones.","I listen the album in the following order:1. Obscured By Clouds (8 good)2. When youre in (7.5 good)3. Mudmen - (10/10 one of the best floyd instr.)4. Burning Bridges (8 good, its instrumental above is better)5. Wots uh the deal - (10/10 one of the best floyd ballads)6. Stay - (9 Good)7. Free Four (not much relisten value)8. ChildHoods End (ok dokey not much to write about)9. The God is in the... - (unfloyd, should not have been in the album)10. Absolutely curtains."
2,I THINK THE FLOYD WERE OBSCURED BY CLOUDS WHEN WRITING THIS,The music for the soundtrack of La Valle is totally crap just like Atom Heart Mother and More. I don't reccomend it.
5,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC.,"Pink Floyd must be played as loud as possible so as not to miss one beautiful, soaring note. The music must fill your lungs with every breath and seep into your soul. This album is quite simply....BEAUTIFUL. Its more ""rock"" Floyd than alot of their other stuff, but you can hear the trippy, hallucinogenic jam band seeping through on most of the tracks. What a group of fantastically talented musicians. I like to just let this album play and veg out to it. The music encapsulates you, and you become a part of the album. There is no better musical group ever. And there will never be another one that reach the stratosphere of talent that Floyd acheived. I thoroughly enjoy all the songs on here, not a bad one to be found. My favorite song is 'Wot's....Uh, The Deal' which is actually one of my ALL TIME favorite Floyd songs. ""Obscured By Clouds"" is a must have for any Floyd devotee. A must have for any MUSIC fan!!!!!!"
5,way2vroom4u,"I actually give this album 10 stars. Why this album does not get more acclaim is beyond me. I couldn't phathom a Pink Floyd collection without this album. My favorite tracks: ""Burning Bridges"" and ""Mudmen""-both romantic and soulfull! ""Mudmen"" is a track that continues the tune originated in ""Burning Bridges"" but is essentially a bluesy guitar solo by Gilmore. I Love You Dave!"
5,This book is GREAT!,"I have read this book and it's amazing. I am only 11 years old, but I still love cetaceans!"
5,What a great book!,"This book has so much information. It is a great guide including information on different species, where they live, ocean pollution, and so much more!"
4,Learn about whales,"Well good book but short information, good for whales amateur, with great pictures inside and pretty explanation in wildlife, if you like sea mammals or thinking a watchwhale tour go outside and buy it"
2,The Reason America is Doomed,"There were a few insightfull stories in this tome. But, this book is written by a real liberal. In his eyes there is no winning. There is only digging one hole to be filled by digging another. Tim O'Brien is a wimp, part of the wussification of America. There is no black or white just ambiguity. This explains why this book is used so much by colleges and universities (liberal educators). In effect this book says ""I am so smart that I can't actually kill the man that wants and WILL kill me. I can look though the enemy's eyes and I am the enemy."" What a lot of drivel. When America and the rest of the Western World is taken over by Islam his descendents and mine will bow reverently toward Mecca."
5,Great Quality,"This hitch receiver was very easy to install, fit great, and the loops on it actually allow safety chains to be passed through, unlike some other hitches I have encountered. The only stumbling block I hit was that one of the nuts was not included. A quick look at the instructions told me the exact size I needed, and I sourced it from a local nut and bolt supply place (Home Depot and Lowes didn't have it as it is a somewhat unique metric size). I've towed just about 2,000 miles with this hitch receiver and hitch, pulling a 16' boat and a loaded 5'x8' enclosed trailer, with no issues whatsoever."
5,"gritty, powerful, unrelenting and unforgettable","The late, great African-American genius Clarence Cooper, Jr., is (quite) possibly better than Hemingway.That's what I said--and I'm a huge Hemingway fan.Unfortunately, in his lifetime, not only was Cooper's work not given the respect it deserved, but (in some circles) it was even treated as hack work by an unimportant writer.It all ended in a room in a flophouse in NY. Penniless and alone. An original voice like this. Silenced.They did it to Van Gogh. They did it to Poe. Beaten down by their inferiors."
2,Beatles for...re-master,"Can you believe this, yet another crime against art. The music is really good, the cover is great, but the digital production stinks! Shame on Apple/EMI and George Martin for settling for this kind of sound quality.01. No Reply - 10/1002. I'm A Loser - 10/1003. Baby's In Black - 10/1004. Rock & Roll Music - 7/1005. I'll Follow The Sun - 10/1006. Mr. Moonlight - 6/1007. Kansas City - 8/1008. Eight Days A Week - 10/1009. Words Of Love - 8/1010. Honey Don't - 7/1011. Every Little Thing - 10/1012. I Don't Want To Spoil The Party - 9/1013. What You're Doing - 9/1014. Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby - 7/10This is obviously a 4 star album, but with such poor ""digital"" production it gets 1 star. So that looks like 2 1/2 stars."
4,Incredible...,"So, you've just put your ""heart & soul"" into the stunningly effective music for your first film and your record company then says we need an album by Christmas. With less than six months to deliver the goods it's hardly surprising that ""Beatles For Sale"" is regarded as one of their lesser albums. But take a step back... how many groups, then or now, could compose, in such a short time, five classic tracks like ""No Reply"", ""Eight Days a Week"", ""Every Little Thing"", ""Look What You're Doing"" & ""I'll Follow the Sun"" while delivering, on the way, definitive versions of Buddy Holly's ""Words of Love"" and Chuck Berry's ""Rock & Roll Music"". Review it in context and it's incredible."
4,Excellent album except...,Several classic L&M tunes and one of my favorite albums except for the cover songs. Mister Moonlight is arguably the WORST song on any Beatles album.
3,"Weakest album, but with some sparks of brilliance","This album starts off with the incomparable ""Triad of Misery"", certainly three of the most depressing songs in the Beatles discography. This could've been their ""dark"" album, but instead we get some weak covers and the standard light Beatles fare. ""I'll Follow the Sun"" is a nice little song, but that's about the extent of it - nice. ""Eight Days a Week"" could've fit right in on AHDN, with an atmospheric, giddy intro and catchy melody. But besides these five songs, everything else pales in comparison. A weak effort all around."
2,Quite Honestly...,This is [bad] by Beatles standards. They didn't really get good until Revolver...then they got really good...but this is just quite average. Even for the Beatles.
1,5 stars became 1 star,"I have nothing to say. It is 21 century. When I was a little boy I had all these recordings in tape, in full stereo!!!!!!.WHY MONO????????. Don't buy it!!!!."
1,The Worst album of All time?,"The Beatles For Sale Holds a Strong Title as the worst Rock album ever released. It's Funny how beatles fan say this album is great and underrated and then you go dismiss other bands albums because it's not as good as this horrible piece of so-called ""Music"". The Rolling Stones will Crush the Beatles Any day and this horrible album is the reason why The Rolling Stones are Better."
1,FINAL CRITIC IV/ Beatles for sale,"""tired (1)""Look at the cover . They were tired , and the album is mostly inessential rubbish . Only interesting fact : Lennon writes his first introspective songs *"
3,nice songs but oh!,"I dont know what Iam saying,..the songs are nice but oh very lovely and melancholy!"
4,Lyrics by John The Misogynist !,"Stuck between two brilliant bookends (Hard Day's Night and Help!), Beatles for Sale is perhaps the most obvious title for this 1964 offering: some big hits sprinkled among covers and bleak Lennon compositions, marketed to sell on the wave of Beatlemania at it's crest. Not their best or worst, with some questionable production values (on CD at least).Highlights -No ReplyI'm A LoserBaby's In BlackI'll Follow The SunEight Days A WeekTake it or leave it -Rock And Roll MusicKansas City / Hey, Hey, Hey, HeyWords Of LoveEvery Little ThingI Don't Want To Spoil The PartyWhat You're DoingAnd the simply dreadful -Mr. MoonlightI gave it 4 stars, on the strength of the few gems, singular among them Eight Days A Week."
4,"Their best before ""Rubber Soul""","Before I got this CD, I assumed from the reviews I had read that this was one of the weakest Beatles albums. Well, now that I have it, I realize how wrong I was. This, to me, is the first Beatles album that hints at, even more so than their next one ""Help"", the greatness they would achieve on ""Rubber Soul"" and everything after that. The sound of this album is a noticeable improvement over ""Hard Day's Night"", and for the first time we have John writing more personal lyrics. I really like all eight Lennon/McCartney compositions here, and some of the covers are quite fun as well (I expecially enjoy Ringo on ""Honey Don't"", which contrary to Amazon's track listing, is track 10. Also, in case anyone doesn't know, ""Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby"" is track 14. They really ought to show the full track listing.) Anyway, this is my favorite Beatles CD of their first five."
3,The Most Underrated Beatles Album,"This is a quality album. The punishment of the Beatles' schedule probably contributed to the inclusion of six covers here, but the covers are not bad as some have suggested. 'Rock and Roll Music' particularly stand out among them.Above all, the originals here are first rate early compositions. 'Eight Days a Week' was slated to be the Christmas single of 1964 as they prepared to release this album, but John Lennon simply came up with 'I feel Fine' overnight. Clearly it was a fertile period for their songwriting. 'No Reply' and 'I'm a Loser' foreshadowed the introspective songwriting that was to soon to come from Lennon. And as far as relatively unknown Beatles' songs go, I absolutely love 'What You're Doing.'Nevertheless, this was a step backwards after ""A Hard Day's Night."" The release of this album was just too rushed. The band would not repeat this mistake again until the end of their career."
5,Why do people hate this so much,"Okay, I know this album is 30 years old,and was recorded when recording was at its most basic. But that doesn't meann it's bad."
2,but only in mono!,"the bad standard band's album was recorded after a hard days night in that same year 64. This one is recorded in mono only not stereo!!! their albums from 1967 - 1970 were good.....but this one is absolutely tame & weak!Check out other better rock bands albums like deep purple live and studio albums, they are much much better than this one."
2,"A little digging is required, but there are some good songs","""No Reply,"" ""I'm a Loser,"" and ""What You're Doing"" and the best of the originals on this album, in that order.""Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey,"" ""Rock 'n Roll Music,"" and ""Everybody's Trying to be My Baby,"" are the best of the covers, also in that order.This album was made during a time when the Beatles were exhausted, and is one of the Beatles worst albums.However, the album artwork on the cover is fantastic; very honest and gritty."
2,Real Fans Know Better,"Place this CD next to the Yellow Submarine album or an Interview disc and it may look like a must have; I have so say, make it one of the final Beattle CDs to buy. As an owner of over 100 Beatles CD's, I feel like enough of an authority to beg, ""Please Don't!"""
2,Worst Beatles Album?,"I don't actually own this album in my colection but with compilation disks, mp3 etc I have heard nearly all the songs. I have to say this is the worst beatles album ever, sorry. I'm not saying It's bad, it's just the Beatles are the best group in the world ever and this realy doesn't do justice to them. I am a fan of all beatles songs, but there first songs are no-where near as good as there later, more mature albums. There are quite a few more maturer songs on this album than on A hard days night, but I find them a little boring and not as easy to listen over and over a hundered times (like I do with all other beatles songs). Unlike old Albums such as Please Please Me, Beatles For sale's songs arn't catchy enough - BFS is an attemt at being more mature but the songs just do not work. If you have all the other Beatles albums and you need to complete your collection, get this, all BIG beatles fans should have it. But get Please Please Me and Anything after Revolver First..."
2,oh god ! the whole set sound the same!,"the whole set sound the same, every little thing, words of love sounded very romantic but boring, crying!this one is an easy listening album, for led zeppelin and deep purple fan like me, my ears can't easily take the beatles songs at all.....Im so sorry."
3,Wrong Number of Tracks,"I own this CD and it has 14 tracks, not 12 tracks as listed. Please fix your listing."
4,Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?,"This is, in many ways, The Beatles' most intriguing album. The cover shot itself, with those four glum faces peering out at you, speaks volumes as to the toll that Beatlemania was exacting on those four exausted young men by late 1964. And then there's the song titles: ""I'm a Loser"", ""Baby's in Black"", ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party"", ""No Reply"" -- there was no doubt about it, The Beatles were evolving into something much more than a brilliant pop band. They were clearly set to take things to another level. In retrospect, it's clear that this is the most overtly transitional album of the band's career, with more thoughtful and complex titles (like those listed above) sitting, somewhat uncomfortably, next to uninspired cover versions which were hashed out under intense pressure in order to meet the never-ending series of recording deadlines. The end result is equal parts frustrating and fascinating -- and quite possibly the most essential piece of the extraordinary Beatles puzzle."
3,Beatles for Sale - Remastered,I didn't realize the CD would be in a hard cardstock paper. I was expecting a hard plastic one. Sound is good.
3,BIG BAD BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS,"This late 1964 release finds the Beatle rather war weary after a year of touring. The album consists primarily of their old nightclub act.It may not be their best, but hey, lets face it... these guys could pass gass for 48 minutes on an album and it would be better that 97% of the music out today."
5,Forgotten Classic,"I'm Brett Gilbert. Here is some typical dialogue.""Beatles for Sale.""""What?""""Beatles for Sale.""""Don't think I know that one.""Sadly, one of the Beatles' best albums has sunken into forgetfulness for many casual listeners. Perhaps because it is sandwiched between two of their best known LP's chronologically speaking, this album is an unappreciated masterpiece in the career of the Fab Four. It was the album which marked definite independence of composition style between Lennon and McCartney as writing became much more of an individual act. The Beatles come together quite nicely, however, no matter who writes the song. ""Beatles for Sale"" has lots of nice covers and terrific original compositions. I highly recommend it for any fan. It is an undiscovered jewel in the early-middle stages of an incredible musical career."
4,Just let me hear some of that Rock and Roll Music,"This album is a good overall album. I'll admit that it was a little bit disappointing after ""A Hard Day's Night"" as it has 6 cover songs on it and only 8 by Lennon/McCartney. However, that by no means makes the album substandard. All the Lennon/McCartney songs are great and the covers are played and sung very well. Still a must for any complete Beatles collection."
3,Worth listening to--3 1/2 stars,"Being a bealtlemaniac, it's very hard for me to give this album 3 1/2 stars, but I just had to. This has to be the worst Beatles album. BUT, there are some very enjoyable songs on there. For any other band I would probably give it 5 stars, but this was the Beatles, and I know it's unfair but if Spt Pepper is 5 stars, (which it most definately is)Beatles For Sale has to be 3 1/2. If you compare it to the other albums out there in 1964 it deserves 5 stars, but compared to all the other brilliant stuff the Beatles put out there, this just doesn't match up. If they spent some more time on it, I think it could be incredible. But, they didn't, and there are just too many covers on there."
4,"NOT THE BEATLES BEST, BUT STILL GREAT.","At the time this album was made The Beatles were between tours and totally exhausted. This did not stop them producing a good album. However, Beatles for Sale is not the best of the Beatles. After A Hard Day's Night, which contained all original songs, this one only manages 8. But one cannot criticise the Beatles for that, as this was at a time when many artists couldn't even compete that number of originals! Some of the cover songs (particularly ""Mr. Moonlight"") are rather poor (by Beatles standards) but the album is worth purchasing just for the superb rendition of Chuck Berry's ""Rock and Roll Music"" which was recorded in one excellent spontaneous take.So, not the Beatles' best, but it has to be taken into consideration that for any other group, this album would be excellent."
2,looks better than it is,"another title aimed at information architects/web designers that doesn't really do the business. it's got some good pictures, but there isn't a great deal of rewarding stuff there."
4,Learn degital media with fun !,"This book is not only for beginners but also for other levels. I think you will not feel relax, until you finish reading this book."
1,This is H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E - HORRIBLE!,"The comparisson to Heather Nova was ridiculous. The only thing these women have in common (and we all know it isn't talent) is that they're both capable of bearing children.You can find better-sounding music on any amateur night in any bar in any city in any country on any continent.Maybe that's a bit much. The thing is - this woman doesn't sound bad, necessarily; it's that she doesn't necessarily sound good either and I find my level of apathy toward her to be a good indication of how GENERIC she sounds. Create a soundtrack to your life - don't just fill it with this tepid mall music.In the end - don't waste your money or your time."
4,Some great 'points' (pardon the pun),I recently saw a presentation by someone and I could immediately notice Mr Edwards techniques at work. I really like his approach and his methods work (especially after seeing someone else use them effectively) He does state that you can make your own presentation template but the I'm no graphic artist and I think it really requires someone with this skill to create a template for you that establishes your 'brand'
5,"Best Power Point Instruction, Period.","I've looked at a lot of Power Point how-to-courses and ""dummies books."" Jim is, hands down, the best teacher of this material. Yes, even better than ""The Professor."" In addition to cool tips about fonts and other guidance to make your presentation scream ""Professional"", he also saved me hours of time with template creation, cool chart insertions and animation. This training is very under-priced in my opinion. (And I told him so.) Definitely grab this. Good information here for both the newbie as well as the experienced Power Point user. It's like watching over the shoulder of a friend, making the learning curve fast and easy. He goes way beyond the extra mile in all the quality content delivered."
5,How to create a killer powerpoint presentation,"WOW, what can I say. Jim Edwards has really outdone himself. This DVD really spells it out in amazing detail. I've done powerpoint presentations for years, and yet learned a ton from Jim's DVD.I am so impressed with the material and Jim's style in teaching. I look forward to creating many products very soon.Josef Mack"
5,"Jim Edwards, Master Presenter","Jim Edwards is one of the best people I have ever come across when it comes to teaching ""how tos"". He breaks things down in clear step by step processes that make mastery easy. No hype, just straight forward instructions that make using Power Point EASY - even if you have never used it before.Thanks Jim, I'll be using this information over and over.Annie Desantis[...]"
5,Jim always Overdelivers,"I bought Jim's very first infoproduct, and I've been a member of his private membership site since Day 1. And I've made many, many thousands of dollars implementing what I've learned from ""Big Jim.""This product is no exception. The highlights for me were: how to create a master slide, the creation flow process, and the presentation delivery advice.As usual, I have a TON of notes ... and was able to take immediate action!"
1,This is fraud,Absolutely zero value. Presentation designed to sell snag-it software. Second part of the presentation was commercial on Jim's graphic designer. Beware making any purchase based on five-star rating. This is absolute nonsense.
4,Excellent,Very well explained and showing all the necessary steps? I had no idea about how to dance but by watching this video I feel very good about it now.
4,Beginner Dancers,"This DVD has helped my wife and I become better dancers. It features the teacher and his partner but then shows very average people of all ages dancing throughout the DVD. Being male, I was a little intimidated by this at first but quickly lost that feeling because of the pace and teaching techniques the instructors use. Good buy! Only drawback is that if you rewind often to watch and practice on your own, you quickly get tired of the music being played."
4,Very easy to follow,This is a great DVD for someone just learning to ballroom dance. Kyle explains how to do both the man's and ladies' steps making it extremely easy to follow. The fashions and hairstyles are a bit outdated but all in all it's a very good way to learn the basics.
1,for beginnners only,"If you are an absolute beginner and have never danced at all before, then you may find this course to be helpful. Otherwise, there are better instructional videos out there. The technique and style demonstrated are not of professional calibre. Also, the course claims to demonstrate 30 patterns. The number is nowhere near that, and is closer to 15, total (almost 5 basic patterns per dance). I say almost, because in one of the patterns, he calls the exit of the step by another pattern name. Sadly, the pattern name he uses is nothing like the pattern known in most dance circles. However, the audio CD which is included is quite good."
5,Outstanding production and instructional quality,"This DVD is head and shoulders above most other ballroom dancing instructional videos. The production quality is high -- nice music, good lighting, smooth editing, and even real sets. The party dance sequences are staged with ""regular"" people of all ages and skills, helping to motivate the student. The instructions and demonstrations are smooth and easily followed. It is geared perfectly for beginners. The ""bonus"" music CD is good, too. Highly recommended."
3,Concise,"This book is, in my opinion, a good but brief look at the basics to creating games with DX9. It does require you to have a fair knowledge of C++ and rougly A-Level maths skills are useful.It is an interesting and easy read and covers topics that i haven't seen in other books so i would highly recommend it to someone hoping to extend their programming skills or looking to start games programming."
4,A good book for start,"When I decided to buy this book,I was in a doubt if this book can help me in an easy way?Now I know that it Can.I found this book a good one for beginning,because it's a very good book about direct3d but not about 3d games.Although Frank Luna has a reliable and also easy to read way of writing texts,but because the subject is hard by it's nature,a beginner may find it hard at the beginning."
3,"An introduction. Nothing more, nothing less.","I guess this book delivers what it promises, more or less. It effectively introduces you to directx. It devotes 20 or so pages to each of 20 or so topics (the dimensions of the book are real small though, so the page counts are somewhat misleading). By the end of the book you'll understand what directx is and what directx can do, but what I found is that there just isn't enough ""meat"" there to learn any part of directx well enough to do anything useful with this knowledge."
4,Great book to get started. Clear and Concise,"I started DirectX programming recently. This book brings you upto speed very fast. It is well organized, written well, and is kept very simple. It's objective is to teach concepts and how to program specific concepts is C++. The examples and straightforward and illustrate whats in the text very well.Like all other reviewers, I should agree that the title of this book is misleading. There is very little, if any ""Game development"". The book is all about the basics of 3D drawing using drect XIf you want to start programming DirectX over the weekend with some nice 3D graphics including textures, lights and terrains and even fireworks, this is the book for you. I highly recommend it."
3,"Great Book, But NOT for beginners","This is an excellent book; I really liked the in-depth coverage throughout the book. However, I bought this book with very little C++ experience and was left in the dust with advanced C++ techniques immediately following the first chapter. This is probably the best DirectX 9.0 book on the market, however, don't buy it unless you are advanced in C++ and know matrix math and trigonometry. Other than that, it is really good. I bought this book, which was not designed for a complete beginner. These other reviews posted here were misleading, especially the one by Emanuel Enrique."
5,wonderful read,I love the book. My two favorite storie are Lorrie's lesson and Betsy's story.i think the format is extremely clever - especially with the lessons at the end of each story. and it's wonderful to have an uplifting book - such a validation of life!
2,"somewhat entertaining, but why bother","read Gold Warriors instead, this whole book falls apart when the author admits at the end that he never actually sees one bar of gold, thus, all of his sources are suspect."
1,The worst....,"I loved this series and have been eagerly awaiting this installment. I found it boring, dated - the characters who used to be so distinct, vibrant and hilarious were flat and one-dimensional.Blah.........."
1,How's your novel? Don't ask...,"I have never read any of his other works so I am finding it incredibly difficult [...].I forced myself to read 150 pages or so into this book and simply could not go any further.Whilst some may view the lack of storyline, developed characters and interesting material as a brilliant statement on the state of the ""gay world"" today, I find it weak.I may not always agree or like what writers write but if they do it in an engaging and passionate manner I will most certainly read them through to the end. There was very little that was engaging in this novel.Regardless of what reviewers have said about his other works I will not be exploring this ""cycle"" any further."
3,McFarlane in decline,"McFarlane wrote the original version of the book during his second stint with the Syndicate. I think the Syndacate had other ideas and let McFarlane finish The Melted Coins and World War II end before letting the hammer fall. In 1945 when the war ended this book was published then the heat was put on the author to bring the Hardy's into the scientific age. Like any of us at work, when change is implemented, we react with negativity. McFarlane at this point I feel became uninterested in the series and wrote his worst book to date only to be surpassed in 1947 by The Phantom Freighter. The book was average by the sets standards but sub par by McFarlane's standards. The revision was not much worse. Taxidermy become the sub plot and fingerprinting is performed for the first time in the series in this volume. The child like innocence held in the earlier volumes is now gone.ORIGINAL Rated C+ Revision: Rated C"
3,An Average Read,"This review concerns the revised 1966 edition. Frank and Joe investigate the theft of a number of stuffed animals from a country auction and aid their father with his case concerning an industrial spy ring that is using short-wave radio to send coded messages containing the names of various wild animals. This book was average; the mystery was alright and it had a moderate amount of action. Most fans would probably not be bored with this book, but I don't think that many would be very excited by it either."
4,a childhood memory,"Sneaking around, discovering what other teens or adults were up to, solving crimes, ahh, I loved this series.I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom."""
3,Worth reading,"The stories were wordy but you know I still couldn't put the book down. It was interesting to read all about the people, how there lives were before they got sick or hurt and how they came to hear about KC, then finally how there lives were changed thereafter.It wasn't the greatest piece of literature that I have ever read by a long shot but I picked out some of the stories and shortened them as I read them out loud to to a close male friend who would never have read the book (it helped him to begin to believe that God can do amazing miracles in our lives) then I passed the book on to another sick friend who had the time to read it."
2,save your money,I was very dissapointed with this product. The lighted panel for number display is not visual friendly. The speaker function volume is to low for use unless you are standing with your ear pressed against the speaker.I would not recommend this product at all.
2,Don't waste your money,"The quality of this unit is the pits. The sound is close to okay for out in the garage where I have mine. The CD player did not last long and was quirky form the day I took it out of the box. I now use it to play MP3s off a memory card and have to admit this is a nice feature to begin with. At this point, if it wasn't for the MP3 capability, it would be in the trash."
3,Business Approaches to Organizations,"This is a collection of theories from the business literature about the behavior of people in organizations and the organizational forms it engenders. In addition, a gentle introduction to economic concepts from choice theory and game theory is given. The book does not really achieve a synthesis of the different ideas presented, even though the authors attempt to tie the approaches together in the chapter introductions and the (weak) conclusion. Deeper insights are perhaps not possible at this level of presentation. Redeeming features are the clear and readable exposition of each theory, and the well-chosen examples. The book works well as an initial primer for economists about business research on organizations and strategic management. For this purpose, I would recommend it, since the coverage is fairly complete and, though not formal, cogent and to-the-point."
1,Misleading VCD,The title is misleading when stated that there was a VCD included. Packaged arrived and it was only a single CD with a bonus video in it. Dissapointed!!
1,It's time to face the music,"I know that Ricky's fans will never admit it, but deep down inside they know this is mediocre at best. That's the nicest thing I can say about this cd. It is so unoriginal; there are thousands of songs that sound just like these. If Ricky hadn't had the incredible success of La Vida Loca, you wouldn't see such positive reviews. His fans are just being loyal and that's understandable, but there are many other Latin artists who deserve your attention and your 5 star reviews."
1,Keep pushing away the REAL TRUTH...(D+ Recording),"This is another example of where the music industry stands: in the bottom of the toilet. Come on people, is the same people in Miami, with the same brainless arrangements, the foolish and silly lyrics, the overproduced Casio quality recordings, and the poor artistic vision of its musicians. When is it going to end? No more good music comes from Latin America; it's all monopolized by the same people in the Estefan network. These individuals must be pushed away from the music scene. Latin America won't be able to grow into one big nation because the big media and entertainment companies are ruled by poor, unimaginative, uninspired, unoriginal, untalented, ignorant, illiterate, and uneducated low class professionals.Hal Robert Jr.Music Teacher from Mongolia"
1,Do not buy this CD!,"Ricky Martin is the worst artist on the entire world, his last album just show his poor music and vocal on that production, if you want to get a really good album.I highly recomend you Chayanne, Luis Miguel, Christan Castro."
4,Ricky Martin @ his best,"I must say, one of his best albums since ""A Medio Vivir"". Great music selection with Some great ballads{""Tal Vez"", ""Si tu te Vas"", ""Nadie Mas que Tu"", ""Asignatura Pendiente"", and ""Las Almas del Silencio""}. He also has some good songs that make you move{""Jaleo"", ""Jamas"", ""Juranmento""} I Believe that Ricky is a great artist, but in my opinion he is at his best in Spanish. I like his music, and I like his style but some of his best work has been in Spanish. --JD--"
3,Good lyrics but poor vocals,"""ALMAS DE SILENCIO"" is Ricky Martin's finest work but his poor vocals kill the album.Ricky Martin is no Luis Miguel. Let's just get that straight. He is charismatic and is a marketing and publicity genius but unlike Luis, he lacks musical erudition.The album has fantastic lyrics. Each song has it's own trademark. You can tell that he plans on releasing each one as a single.The CD has too many producers, that is why it seems like a fruit salad. The album is congenial in the sense that each song has the Ricky Martin seal but half of that seal is shared with the producer and/or songwriter and Martin fails to make the songs entirely his own.If you're looking for a fun cd to have in your car, I recommend Almas del Silencio. It is catchy and won't put you to sleep. And if you understand Spanish then you will surely appreciate the great lyrics.However, if you are looking for a great voice, musical genius and a more graceful performance, pick up Luis Miguel's ""Romances""."
5,"If you don't like him, WHY o why are you even here?","Ricky Martin must really be worth writing a bad review because several people have given their opinion to ppl who still continue to listen. Who cares? This is a great album, and just one of his many. Ricky Martin was around long before living his crazy life, long before ppl had anything to say about him. Funny, how lots of ppl missed his appearance in one of US most popular daytime soaps, from many I've spoken to. In any case, the music on this album is a compilation of poetry written by Ricky Martin, and a host of his fellow singer/songwriters who also happen to be fabulous in their own right (ie -Alejandro Sanz, who by the way didn't write Tal Vez, but Almas Del Silencio....Tal Vez penned by Franco de Vita; Juanes, Ricardo Arjona, Estefano, Emilio Estefan...). Hey, and if this isn't your 'bag' that's ok. The fans just don't think about the nay'sayers as we shake our bom boms to this music!!"
3,"Not bad, but could have been better","I bought this cd for the hit single ""Tal Vez"", one of the most beautiful songs Ricky Martin has ever sung. After hearing this entire cd, I have to say that it isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular neither. The best songs are: Jaleo, Tal Vez (the best one), Todo queda en nada(the second best), Juramento, and Almas del Silencio. I really hope he does a better job next time."
4,Te Amo,"I didn't think I would like it as much as Vuelve but I do. I love Jaleo, Razas, Jamas and Si Ya No Estas is my absolute favorite. Oh Ricky Te Amo!"
5,Far superior to his English release,"Like most of America, I heard Livin La Vida Loca daily until I liked it. I bought the CD and I was delighted that the music was pretty good if a bit goofy at times (Shake your bon bon? Ugh!). But Almas Del Silencio? Wow! The music is soooo much better. It is soul stirring and you can feel the emotion when Ricky sings. It is raw and pure and beautiful. Whether you understand Spanish or not, there is no mistaking the feelings conveyed here. Ricky's vocals are stunning! It was no surprise at all to see how into the music Ricky was during the making of the album when I saw the VCD (which was a good while after I purchased it). This is a very safe purchase and you'll never grow tired of it! There is something on it for everyone whether you're dancenut or a ballad person. Highly recommended!"
5,What a perfect CD!,The only thing that I have to say about this album is that Ricky Martin will get another Grammy. Every single song is wonderful and well done. What a come back for Ricky Martin!
2,"Not Electrolux, cheap knock-off","I ordered this filter, but instead of the Electrolux brand in the description and in the photo, I got a cheap looking knock-off with no markings whatsoever.Suggest you avoid this seller."
2,"Adequate, only just","Over all this translation is not bad, but seems hastily written. For example, there is a missing line here and there, and in a few passages the translator does not seem able to follow Symeon's argument (admittedly not always an easy task). The translation does not include Scripture citations."
5,A great and exellent review,"The White Mountains is a great and exellent science fiction book. The White Mountains is mostly about how Henry, Beanpole and Will travled to the White Mountains. So, one of my favorite parts is when Beanpole carved out that tracer thing under Wills arm and I think one of the most exiting part is more tords the end of the book were Will, Henry and Beanpole just destroyed a tripod and so they had too wate about a week till they could get out of there hide-out because there were about 20-45 tripods all around trying to find them. I'm ten years old and loved all these books. So if you have a son thats 9-12 years old I think you should really consider bying this for him/her."
3,An exciting and nerve-racking adventure!,"The White Mountains is written by John Christopher. In this book, there are four main charcters: Will, Henry, Beanpole (Jean-Paul,) and the Tripods, who are the protagonists. There is a process which is called being ""capped."" Being capped makes the men and women who wear them docile and obedient. Will and Henry must escape to the White Mountains, in order to avoid being capped. Beanpole joins the pair later on in their journey. The trio encounter many problems along the way. But will they get caught by the Tripods? Will they make it to the White Mountains? Read this book to find out!"
5,This was a cool book,"This book is really cool. It mixes sience fiction with action and suspense. Be sure to read the other books in the series including ""When the tripods came"" because it came out later then all the others but is a prequel to this book"
1,Tripods,I did not like the ending. They built it up to be a great ending and they failed. Otherwise the book was not be.
3,Love it,This book is a fun read. I enjoyed it a lot. I had this for my Children's Lit. class and it was a fun book to do a discussion on.
4,This book turned me on to Sci Fi!,"I was surprized that a book like this interested me so much! It mesmerized me from the very first page! I remember thinking that..since it was a story about 2 boys,I wouldn't be interested,being a female teenager, yet the story turned me on to sci-fi in general! I read the whole trilogy series and am now saving this book for my own children,hoping it will open their eyes to sci-fi as much as did mine:) Very easy,smooth reading."
4,"This book is full of adventure,action, and originality","The Reason I like this book is that first I love to read books that don't talk about one subject for half the book. I like to read books that keep on going like this one. It does, though, talk to little about things, but I get really bored with a lot. I like to read also that this book is just full of adventure and adventure books are by far the best.The book is very origianal too. It's is a very unique book by far because firstly the time setting. It takes place in the future, but it seems like the past. It seems like the past because they have no technology because the unique atagonists destroyed them. The atagonists are like robotic, three legged stools and that is very creative."
3,"""The White Mountains""-A Good Book","The White Mountains is a pretty good book. It is something that I would rather read once, though. It tells the story of three cousins, Will, Jack, and Henry. They have heard stories of the White Mountains and the Tripod for years. The oldest cousin, Jack, gets his capping, and is kept as a slave. Will and Henry were afraid, so they planned to run away in the next two weeks. Will also meets a friend, a Vagrant, that is, named Ozymundas, who is mentally ill. He gives Will a piece of advice. So, the two week point comes by in time, and they set off, to the White Mountains to rescue Jack. They meet memorable characters, places, and things along the way."
4,The White Mountains,This is a book about tripods that control the world. A boy runs a way to the mountains there are no tripods there. Along the way he makes friends. And has to hid from the tripods and people who will take him and his friends to the tripods. I think this book is pretty good I say this because it is very descriptive but at the start it is confusing. it is also action packed.
5,"Dayna - Balitmore,Maryland","The White Mountains is a GREAT book .The book is a teen sci-fi like no other. Once you read the first book in the tripod series (When the Tripods Came) you will never want to stop. The White Mountains is a Page-turning, Mind-twisting thriller. While you read it you will be curious, confused, ""brain-dead"". You will ask millions of questions about it.Do you think that you can manage to escape the wonders of the alien masters called The Tripods. This book literally knocks ""The Lion, Witch, and The Wardrobe"" in to the dust. Don't take my word for it read yourself. Watch out for the CAP!"
4,"Good book, and definitely worth taking the time to read...","I got hooked on this series in 6th grade (an entire 5 years ago, incredible...), and, as my school library had all of them, finished the entire series, all four books. They carry a feeling of a very common theme among Sci-fi writers, of the entire world against a small resisitance force, and its very obvious that Mr. Christopher got his ideas for the basics of the Masters species from War of the Worlds, but beyond this, he really pulls the book together and makes a very intriguing plot. For sure a great story and worth giving a try."
4,"Autumn - Baltimore,maryland",LISTEN UP! How would you feel if something or someone took over your mind? Now in the story THE WHITE MOUNTAINS people of the age 14 became capped (brainwash) by things called tripods. This shows being changed from boy to young man.The main character Will don't want to be capped so is traveling to the White Mountains. Will meets lots of people along the way. You will hear about it if you get the book. Why do you think the story is called the White Mountains? Would you travel to the White Mountains?Do you think Will would get capped along the way?I think Will is doing the right thing because I would like to have choice instead of doing what someone or something telling me what to do. I would be upset like Will if my parents agreed to cap. I WONDER WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE IF WE HAD TO BE CAPPED?
5,One of the Best EVER!,"Some 20 years ago while in the boy scout program I got hooked on a little cartoon featured each week in ""Boys Life"". The title, ""The White Mountains"". I remember waiting on pins and needles until the new segment came out each month. It finally struck me to check in my local library and to my surprise there was not just one book but a series. I checked these out, read all of them that night, and to this day still vividly remember the story and characters. This is a great book, a fantastic series, and one of the most memorable reading experiences of my life.An outstanding series for both young and old. Enjoy!"
3,It could have been better,"The White Mountains is written by John Christopher. The story takes place in the future, all the things from the present are destroyed. In the book, Will and Henry travel from Wherton to the White Mountains. They go to the mountains because a man from the mountains tells them about the tripods, big white machanic robots. These robots put caps(metal plates) on humans when they are turning into a man or woman. The caps control them, so the tripods enslave the humans. The White Mountains is were people with no caps escape, and try to save others. They try to get to the White Mountains without being captured... This is a great story, because of all the details, but the ending is a little lame."
2,The White Mountains,"This book is about a boy named Will who lives in the future. Even though it's the future their sort of living in the past because the evil tripods that descended upon earth a long time ago and destroyed every thing. Every body thinks that the tripods are good but............they aren't because they cap people which brainwashes their mind and the tripods are telling their brain that getting capped is good. Will has a cousin named Henry who likes to tackle him and stuff. But Henrys mom died and he had to live with Will. Anyways, Will finds out that getting capped is bad and he runs away and Henry follows him and goes on a big adventure. If you like Si Fi this is your book but if you don't I wouldn't recommend it. This book wasn't my favorite."
1,Awful!,"I hated this book. I didn't finish it because it was so bad. I don't recomend it at all. If you like good books, don't read this!!!"
5,a thrilling and invigerating tale,The White Mountains is a suspensfull tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time you read it. It is simply the kind of book that makes you never want to stop!
1,Beware not a real leather ball!,Very disappointed this is not a leather ball. Own several other real leather balls and there is no comparison. The ball is lopsided and Molten is already wearing off.Have not contacted seller hopefully they will refund.
3,reissue of 1912 edition,"Despite the misleading new title, this is a straight reissue of the 1912 first edition of _Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution: A Chapter in the History of Botany, 1470-1670._ The third edition (1970; edition 2 is 1938) is available on Amazon."
1,Misguided emotion,"The murder of his son, while tragic, does not confer ligitimacy on a crusade against public safety. Yes, that's right. Against. Trying to antagonize another motorist until he pulls a gun is stupid, not evidence of too many guns. As the saying goes, a liberal is a Republican who hasn't been mugged yet. Disarming those willing to abide by the law leaves them defenseless to those who are unwilling."
1,SELLER DISHONEST-WOULD NOT HONOR SALE PRICE,"Seller listed item at just under $2.00, shipping charges over $20, then claim it was for 1 pig ear only-would not honor ad or my purchase-canceled order! Customer satisfaction not very important! Buy elsewhere!"
3,"Hot, sometimes scary","Bluntly sexual, raunchy, heavy with BDSM, Rough Stuff takes the reader into some seriously non-vanilla realms. Some readers might find that it doesn't go far enough, but for a reasonably mainstream volume, I think it pushes the envelope just enough. If the sexuality of power and pain fascinates you, give this one a try."
2,"Rough?, This book was barely abrasive!","I read this book because I had read alot of stories from the collected authors. Some of the stories were interesting, especially Idol by Lucy Taylor and Head Games by Ken Butler, but the rest were just alot of ranting by bitter Queens longing for days gone bye. This is defintely a case of the cover being better than the book."
1,Disappointing,"Is this litterature or just some ""stuff"" anybody can find on the Internet? Except the last story from an English novelist, most of the characters are stereotyped. Some authors made efforts to be original, but it remains desperately poor in terms of psychology. Moreover some scenarios are quite ill, and if mutual respect and human dignity still have a sense for you, forget this book."
1,"PtCruiser, Blue Wagon","Not enough information was given about this product. It was a slot car, not simply a toy car. It was not a car to be played with by a 3 year old boy. We did not remove it from the package as it was not what we expected it to be."
5,One of the Best!,"I own this album between LPs and CDs at least 6 copies, but this 180 gram vinyl is like going back in time. It sounds just great!"
5,GREAT carry case,"This is the perfect protection for your Tomtom. We take our Tomtom out of the car every time we stop (no need to attract a break-in). It fits perfectly in the case, takes up little space in my purse and protects the screen from getting scratched. Definitely recommend this product."
4,Just put it in the case,My TomTom One XL fits in the case. The case is sufficiently sturdy. I only wish there was room for cables.
2,Not Recommended,"Although this case fits my Tomtom One XL perfectly, I would not recommend it to anyone. The zipper is too cheap. I can tell that it will not be long before it breaks. Radio Shack sells a universal case made of leather, for 10 dollars less, that looks like it will function as well, and last longer."
1,Tomtom One XI Carrycase,This item was out of stock and we never received it. We were credited the cost. We would not have known the item was out of stock if we hadn't contacted the company. I think either the company or Amazon should have contacted us as soon as they realized they couldn't fill our order. We were having this shipped to our daughter as a Christmas gift and didn't have time to get another one.
1,TWENTY FOUR NINETY FIVE ON TOMTOM'S WEBSITE,"Are you kidding me --- Two hundred dollars for a case? Go to TomTom's website, click on Products, then OneXL, then Accessories - it's also compatible with the TomTomOne --- pay twenty four dollars and ninety five cents (US) for this case. Duh!"
3,item ok...,"Product is nice except you have no way to ""attach"" the strap. We guess that is just goes under the flap..Wished they would have spent another doller and put some hardware to attach on it."
2,textual problems disappointed me,"I am a huge BtVS fan. I was really looking forward to reading this book. I figured there would be things from the script that didn't make to actual footage because of airtime restrictions. There was minimal of that. It only really appeared in the last two chapters. Also, there were a ton of typos. It kind of ruined the experience of reading it, for me. For any BtVS fan, I think it's a great keepsake, but I think you should just be warned. All the typographical errors, just left a bad tast in my mouth.On good note, it was as gripping as the series. I finished all 668 pages in 3 days. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I couldn't put it down. So, I recommend it, but with caution."
1,So many errors your eyes will bleed....,"As many others have stated before me, this book suffers from the worst editing I've ever seen. It's difficult to believe this is a professionally published work. I believe it is the only book I've read that is so full of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors that it is hard to read. Nancy Holder was the ghost writer and didn't put her name anywhere on it, even in the intro. I'm not surprised, because this is an embarassment to the fandom.Ultimately, this is a simple rehashing of season seven with no character development or special insight, published quickly and carelessly to capitalize on fans' desire for more of our favorite series. Save your money and your time."
4,One of the best books of Buffy,"""Chosen"" is a great summary of what happened in season7.It tells what some of the characters are thinking.Even though the book is 688 pages long,I read in 3 days. The book is very interesting.If you loved season7 or didn't see it,this is a great book for you!It told you what Buffy felt about Spike being dead,she wasn't sad,she was happy for him because now he can rest.Buffy didn't say that on the last epesode.What caused this book to lose a star was the editing.Every time somebody said ""the first"" something they always capatilized it,even if they didn't mean the first evil.There were some errors but you can still understand what they're saying.Chosen is a great book,it even has pictures.So if you really liked the 7th season or didn't see it,this book if for you!"
1,Whedon's work still shines through,"This edition was abysmal. I gave up trying to count the typos, but there had to have been hundreds of them. I realize media tie-in books aren't high literature, but I don't think expecting a little bit of effort is so unrealistic. The only things this book had going for it are the original scripts by Joss Whedon and the other writers of the show. The author's supposed insights into the minds of the characters when they spoke these lines of dialogue are frequently trite and irksome. To me, this was a stop-gap measure until the seventh season comes out on DVD. I didn't get into the series until it was nearly over, so it was at least useful in finding out what happened during the first half. It can get one star for that."
2,"Disappointing ""novelization.""","...The book appears to have been slapped together by someone working from the scripts without any real understanding of the characters or story. Although a few scenes were fleshed out, for the most part it reads more like a synopsis than a novelization. Entire scenes are condensed into a single line of exposition, or completely missing, and the author appears to be writing to a much lower age level than the material is designed for.... (Review edited by author because the website's editing job left the remainder of the review barely coherent. Might as well remove it.)"
2,A clone to tv dialougue,This is actually a almost complete summary of season 7 episodes. Most dialougues are exactly the same from the tv except that there are some missing or slightly different speech from the original scenes from the tv as the tv scenes are being revised. One thing I do not like is the monologue or the point of view of each character that is written to fit into the author imagination. The worst part of all is the Angel and Buffy kissage. I understand that it is a hello but the author turned it into a super romance scene between the two characters that are almost extinct now because of Buffy feeling for Spike and the history that Buffy spending with Spike is longer.
3,Only for the true Buffy fan,"So awful! I mean, so true to Season 7, and in that sense, wonderful, but so awful! Full of typos, and just poorly written (except the dialogue, of course). True blue Buffy fans will love this, but anyone else should steer clear."
3,Enjoyable Story but Sloppily Done,"Being a watcher of the show and a reader of the Buffy books, I was eagerly anticipating the release of this book - WOW an entire season in one novel!! I went to the store, picked it up, and started reading when I got home. I thought the story was great; I couldn't put it down - But then I started noticing the continuous gramatical, punctuation, and spelling errors. After the first I was like, ""Well, the editor missed that one."" I think I lost count of the errors by page 50 (of the nearly 700 pages)!! While I totally enjoyed the story of the Seventh Season of Buffy, the errors kept annoying me. There was one instance where the book leaves out an entire line of dialogue and at one point there was an entire paragraph where every single sentence had some type of error. So, while I would recommend this to anyone, be warned that the publisher obviously forgot to have an editor read it first."
4,I don't think ANYONE edited this book.....,"I don't think ANYONE edited this book..... but the story was accurate to the season. In the novelization, you get more insight to what's going on in the character's minds. Reading this explained a lot of nagging questions that just watching the seventh season left. I truely enjoyed the story, however, the typos were obnoxious. It's like someone spell checked it and sent it directly off to be published. I noticed that ""first"" was capitalized everytime it was used. Even in sentences when THE FIRST wasn't even being discussed. But despite this annoyance, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it."
1,Chosen: The REAL Story Behind the Book,"I was very excited when I heard this book was coming out. My best friend got it as a birthday present, and as I was looking through it- I too noticed many errors not only in quotage but in continuity and just general following of the last season of my beloved show. Now I never missed an episode in all 7 years, so I pride myself on knowing my Slayer stuff. I emailed Nancy Holder and asked her about it and she informed me that she had nothing to do with the book. True, she was going to write it, but had a prior commitment and had to back out of the project. Those who credit Nancy Holder with writing the book, should disregard the information because she didn't write it. In fact, if you look at the book itself, it has no author at all. I'm glad to be able to clear up this matter and hopefully, have restored a little confidence on N.H's behalf."
3,Story is good...,"I, being one of the minority who actually LIKED the seventh season, think that the story this book tells is amazing. One throw off is the fact that there are so many typos it's not even funny. I can't count the times in the book I would point out something wrong with it. Mispelled words all over the place. There's even a scene where Spike and Anya are walking but at the BEGINNING of that part they say that Buffy and Anya are walking... Everytime the words the first are in the book they are like ""the First"" . (e.g. Let's say it was a line saying ""I got the first donut."" In the book, it would read ""I got the First donut."") Just very careless editing..."
2,Author! Author?,"I agree with the previous reviews! I bought this book hoping that it would shed some light on what turned out to be the worst season of one of the best shows on television.I got no insight.Although I did notice one thing....Despite what the picture on this web site shows, the Author's name is nowhere to be found on the cover or on the insides of this book.Hmmmmmmmm........I wonder why."
2,warning!!!,"this book was a grave disappointment. it costs [a lot] and all it does is give you season seven in written form. hello(just got finished watching season seven). if you missed that season this book is for you. if you watched it like me and thought that it was probaly the dullest season to date, skip this buffy book and wait for the next one to come out."
4,Good story.... bad editing,"I'am a very big fan of the show, so I thought it would be interesting to read the 7th season book. It started off good, but then I started to notice all the typos in it. I mean, the author would just spell names wrong. For example: Harbingers would be spelled Harbringers. The author would also capitilize ""The First"" in every instance that it was used in. Even if it had nothing to do with the character. Overall I think the story was good and the book was well spoken. But I think they were in such a hurry to get the book out on shelves that they did a very poor job on editing it. If you are a Buffy fan, read it. If not, you might get frustrated with all the mistakes in it."
3,Interesting read,"This book is a very intersting read and could easily get 5 stars but it loses one star due to all the typos! You can't help but cringe when you read them and you wonder why the editor couldn't take the time to check the spelling!It also loses one star due to Nancy Holder not putting things in full detail. For example: Some scenes from the show were not mentioned in the book, or they were mentioned later, but you still didn't get the full dialogue. Like the scene in the beginning of ""Same Time, Same Place"" where that mexican teenager gets killed by Gnarl, it is not in the book, although his death is mentioned. And the scene with Buffy, Xander, and Dawn in the funeral home at the beginning isn't in the book either.But, it is still interesting to read what the characters are thinking and finding out what some things really meant. And it lets you be able to say that you read a 668 page book!"
3,Not for Osteoporosis,"This workout has value for bonebuilding, flexibility and strength. However, for those who already have osteoporosis/osteopenia forward bends of which there are many in this workout, are not recommended. Therefore I would recommend this workout for people who want to build bone strength and flexibility but I would make it clear that it is NOT for those who have osteopenia/osteoporosis."
1,I should've went to the store,"The only reason i didn't send this piece of junk back is because it would've taken to much of my time. The quality was well below average, fit was awful, and I just hate them. DON'T get this product!!!!!"
1,waiting for replacement,Item came with the battery latch broken in box. Sent back to company...waiting for replacement. It is just what we are looking for for travel...hope to update review when we receive it.
4,Stuka Volume Two: Luftwaffe Ju 87 Dive-Bomber Units 1942-1945,"Another outstanding volume in an outstanding series. The peak of their performance was well behind them by 1942. However, the Stuka soldiered on and in the hands of experienced crews was an effective weapon. The continued service of this outdated weapon systems illustrates the bankruptcy of the Third Reich and for that we all should be grateful."
3,"""Flash"" in the Pan","The J. Geils Band labored in obscurity for many years before they broke through to the big time in the early 80s with the album ""Freeze Frame"" and the massive hit ""Centerfold."" For about a year or so they were unaviodable on the radio. They followed up their success with a moderately successful live album. Then lead singer Peter Wolf left the ""fold"" and the band faded quickly back into obscurity. ""Flashback"" collects the highlights from just before the band's breakthrough to the top until Wolf's departure. The highlights include the three songs from ""Freeze Frame"" including both the title track and ""Flamethrower."" Also excellent is the 1980 classic ""Love Stinks"" the sound of which anticipates ""Centerfold."" ""I Do"" and the lame cover of ""Land of a Thousand Dances"" are from the live album.Overall, this is a middling collection of material with a few highlights that sounds as dated today as anything from the early 1960s."
2,Not a good greatest hits CD.,"I was dissapointed in this CD cause they had to edit out parts of Come Back (which was shortened from 5:09 to 3:34) and they only chose 10 songs, if you're a casual fan of J. Geils Band get Freeze Frame, The Best Of (which contains their 70's hits) and Bloodshot, avoid unless you're a completest."
3,J Geils Band,This wasn't exactly the CD I thought it was...but the CD itself was in great condition. Just as described.
1,LAME,I love J Geils but not this. This is NOT a greatest hitsalbum. This is a lamest hits album. If you want a greatest hits albumget Greatest hits. Or better yet Full House. END
3,Handy's Understanding Organizations,"I bought this book for a class, and the chapters I read made some sense, but in general, I'm not very interested in business books. It was much easier to read than another book for the class. I liked the use of metaphor for cultures chapter."
3,no real relation to Grant Morrison's Invisibles,"This book started interestingly: an anti-Establishment professor overdoses on an experimental psychotropic drug; when he recovers he finds he has access to psychic abilities, the testing of which leads him to a psychic woman and a political & social conspiracy. Unfortunately the rest of the book was a bit of a let-down. The story didn't tap into the delirious heights of conspiracy & occultism I was hoping for (v. Morrison's Invisibles).The book was efficiently written; a short, easy read. I see that the author has written many other books, both fiction and non-fiction; I wonder if one of them is a sequel to this book?"
3,Wasn't bad . . .,Biggest complaint is the fact that Katrina would take the word of an ex-mistress over her own husband's knowing that the ex just wanted to get back in with him. Couldn't believe all the testing took so long either! Surely if he was so well off he could have had the results and such much sooner especially since the ex really didn't have much money. Katrina should have kept the faith and she really needs to do something about her self esteem!!
2,Where's the love?,"Helen Bianchin knows how to do sensual sex scenes and for that I give this book two stars. However, this is also suppose to be a romance and I really didn't detect any true love between Katrina and Nicos. All I saw was two people who were well matched in every way but only seemed to feel intense sexual desire for each other. Where was the love? Where was the trust and committment? After one very intense sexual experience, Katrina ""realizes"" that it couldn't be that intense if it wasn't love. Sorry Katrina but very good (even outstanding) chemistry does not equal love."
4,TracyB,Quite a good book...although Katrina should have more faith in her husband (Nicos). She chose to take his ex-mistress's word intead.
5,In Revere In Those Days,"This was a very intelligently written book, by a very remarkableauthor. This book spoke to all my emotions. I laughed, cryed, smiled, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also could relate to it, even though I am not from the Revere area. My husband is from East Boston, so I could see the similarities.I would like to say that I have read all the books with Revere in the title, however, I think Roland Merullo is such a fantastic author, that the masses have to read him, and I think if his titles did not include the city of Revere he would have a larger audience. I hope he does continue to write for it is truely his forte! I look forward to reading his books to come."
5,"Beyond Articulate, Beyond Moving","I do most of my reading on Kindle. There's a function where you can highlight interesting passages and transfer them to a section called My Clippings. I started doing that but eventually abandoned the practice, because the whole book could be highlighted. He's that good a writer."
2,If you buy only one frog recording this year...,"I listened to this CD on my radio during a long drive. Apparently the DJ needed a break so he played the whole thing. The frog sounds are relaxing. The narrator's voice kinda destroyed the whole frog-vibe I had going. It would have been better to use the narration as liner notes. However, this is a very old recording, done in the days of vinyl, and with so many (short) tracks it would have been difficult to visually see which track was playing and match it up with the appropriate frog on the track listing. So the narrator was needed to identify the frogs on the LP. The CD should have removed the narration - although it's not without its own merit."
3,Doesn't cover required material,"First, this book has a good question and answer section. They actually explain each answer and why it works. Unfortunately, you'll have to learn the information from some other source because this book has nothing in it to help you learn any of the information. BGP is not even covered in the text."
1,BEWARE: just a few pages of incomplete material!,"Yes, this has tons of questions and detailed answers, but it has ALMOST NO text material! 5 chapters and each has about 4 pages of info before the questions, which is extremely spotty coverage. I'd suggest taking a LOOK at this book before you buy it!"
5,Best study guide on the market,"This is the best CCIE written study resource I have found. It has 100's of practice questions with detailed explanations. It also includes a test engine on the CD, which has the same look and feel as the computer based test. I highly recommend this book it is well worth the money."
4,"Awesome questions, but LOTS-O-ERRORS","This book had some awesome questions and some information that I did not find in any other resources. But, there were a lot of typos and other errors. Overall, as I believe the book was intended for, I would just buy it for the questions."
3,The Stargazey,"The best part of this book was the traditional British ""stiff upper lip"" society and class propriety that was part of a murder. It made me want to pull out some of my old Agatha Christie movies's , with Margaret Rutherford. I found some of the characters and their place in the book fragmented, but I enjoyed them showing up and having a cupa. I was a bit disappointed at the end and wonder where was the closure with Kate, Nancy,Dana,Anna or what ever her name was! Was Richard Jury smitten by her? She didn't kill him. Interesting. The last few chapters are plum full of interesting wrap-ups but I think there is too much stuffed in them and the author should have explained the details of the solution a little more clearly and neatly."
1,Strictly for Fans,"All the other opinions are entirely accurate. As a new reader in the Jury series I was quite disappointed. No more. You have to know all about the characters before you read page one, which is too much for a novice. By the end I could not figure out who did what and why. Grimes is certainly clever but draws attention to herself. Many, too many, unresolved issues and plot holes that a creative writing teacher would delete. How can our hero drink constantly without ending up in a detox ward? Too cute, too much, too long."
2,Absolutely absurd,"I'm a great fan of Ms. Grimes' Jury mysteries, but in ""The Stargazey,"" she seems to have gone off the end of the pier (no pun intended). To throw an international assassin/art thief into the company of Jury, Melrose et. al. is a little like Miss Marple finding her way into a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. The juxtaposition is jarring to say the least, and Grimes never convincingly pulls it off. In addition she blatantly copies the London and Broadway play ""Art,"" as well as Dorothy L. Sayers' ""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club."" Homage or rip-off? In addition, I personally am getting a little tired of finding a little girl and a cat in every single Jury mystery. When does a trademark become a tiresome repitition? I think about now. On the whole, the book is as nonsensical and strained as the title itself."
1,Dreadful,"I bought this for a plane ride and was disappointed to say the least. Ms. Grimes obviously doesn't understand the protocol of clubs such as ""Boring's"" where money never changes hands between member and servant. Charges for drinks, etc. are simply recorded and billed later. Also Fortnum & Mason, one of the finest shops in the world, is always abbreviated ""Fortnum's"", never ""Fortnum"". Aside from this kind of trivia, the book is a complete waste of time -- absurd plot and equally absurd characters."
3,Not One of the Best,"I'm in love with Grimes' cast of characters, but maybe not as in love with them as Grimes is. An appearance by every one of them in this latest Jury novel was gratuitous at best. Carol-Anne, Mrs. Wasserman, Racer, Fiona, Agatha, and most especially the cameo appearance of Vivian (""Melrose, what have they done to you!"" exit left) seemed contrived. Also, we all know by now that Melrose has relinquished his many titles, so do we need to be told in every chapter? Especially since he doesn't seem averse to using them in this story. Ah, the story. Just a little far out, isn't it? Sounds like a twist on a real old story...Will Jury come out of his funk and find true love? Will Vivian recover from the Italian disease and come back to be the proper Britisher she really is? Maybe Grimes knows what she's doing after all, 'cause the answers to those questions will compel me to read the next book!"
4,Much Better!,"After initially receiving this item damaged, Nicole at Poster Revolution was happy to replace it. Thank you for rectifying this and making me a satisfied customer!"
2,Buy something else!!!,"You are better of spending your money on ice cream because it will make you feel better. Questions are very out dated and not helpful at all. I think over all they could update their questions and improve quality on it. I am almost compelled to write my own book. Please, Have some quality control or peer reviews on these kind of books because its misleading students and clients."
2,"Chrome-painted plastic, NOT metal","Most of the rack and lids are not made of metal, but painted plastic. The circular top and bottom are the only metal parts on it, and those are just a thin metal shell over plastic underneath them.Also, a few of the lids were loose in the box, and mine came without a Caraway Seed lid, but instead came with two Pizza Seasoning lids. Reeks of a refurb... :|"
5,Great!!,Gave this spice rack to two family members for gifts and they loved it. They said they never had so many spices at once. Great gift idea!!!
1,Defective Hard Drive,"I ordered a 120gb Fujitsu hard drive which I received promptly. However the drive was defective and only capable of holding 40gb of data. I confirmed this at my local Best Buy tech department before returning the product.I was charged the 15% restocking fee, even though the product was defective. I hope that whoever gets this hard drive next only needs a 40gb drive!I will not purchase from, or recommend, Beach Audio again."
1,Horrible toy,"As everyone has already mentioned, it's nearly impossible for my two year old to spin anywhere on this thing, and it takes altogether too much effort. It was interesting for about 5 seconds. And yes, it's WAY too loud, with no volume control, and the audio is extremely annoying. The funny thing is, I only got this because my son enjoyed spinning on his father's electrical wire spool so much. Now I think I'll just buy another wire spool and modify it myself. Total, utter, waste of money."
1,sit and spin your money right down the pooper,"A really large, battery guzzling music box. Certainly all it's good for. It sits allright! And sits... and sits... no spinning yet to be found and my 23 month old son has poked and prodded it from top to bottom. Too stiff... almost like they went stupid crazy overboard on safety precautions? It'd take a couple of semi trucks and a good sturdy wench to get any action outta this thing. Catchy tunes, though."
1,horrible toy!!!!,"This sit and spin is so incredibly hard to spin on, it is almost impossible!!! My daughter has taken it out maybe 5 times since christmas and is done with it in about 2 minutes!! A complete waste of money!!!!"
3,Do you remember when Sit and Spins were fast?,This one is not! I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this. I remember them being alot easier to spin in the 80s. My daughter figured out the turning motion quickly but it's very hard for her to turn. She's already figured out she can go faster standing up (and that's not a good thing). The music is very loud as well. Fortunatly there is an off button for that. This sit and spin is not really worth it.
1,Disappointed with Sit n Spin.,"Very, Very disappointed with the toy. We got it for my son ""2"" for Christmas. It's very difficult to make it turn, not fun at all!"
1,Awful,"This is the worst purchase that I have ever made. I bought this toy for my 2 yr. old niece as a Christmas present and it was a disappointment from the moment we took it out of the box. The seat is oval and very small which makes it very hard to even sit on, then we couldn't get it to spin AT ALL (very flimsy, not very durable). This toy is going back to the store for a full refund. Do not waste your money."
1,Awful!,Don't buy it! $5 is too much to ask for this awful toy. I am absolutly shocked to see the asking price here. Glad I didn't pay even close to that. But I still paid too much because it's garbage. Too hard to spin. My kids hate it. So do I.
1,"Loud, slow, and obnozious","This does not spin nearly as well as the original version, taking a lot of the fun out of it. Also, it is oval shaped, which doesn't fit little bottoms as well. It's noise is loud and obnoxious. Even my son grew tired of the noise. It's durable, but since it doesn't get much use, that's really not much of a selling point!"
1,not worth the money,nothing like the classic. barely spins even if you give it a spin with no one on it. I thought we were upgrading from an old classic one we got second hand. it's not the same. Save your money not worth it and it is soooo loud.
2,Not the same toy we used to love as kids!,"Soooo dissappointed!Waste of space and money.I thought my daughter would enjoy this(as I did as a kid) but it is really hard for her to spin on it(she's 4 and a pretty strong kid).It's also very LOUD!The music is the only thing my kid likes about it.Why did the toy maker change the sit and spin?My cousins and I used to fight over it and we would all pile on top of it and spin,it was a blast.Now my daughter and her 2 cousins barely acknowledge it!What a shame..."
2,Not easy to spin - only one positive -- the music,I remember these sit and spins as a kid and had a great time on them. BUT when my 2-1/2 year old received this as a gift he hardly ever was able to sit and spin on it. It obviously won't spin on carpet (even flat carpet) and I really didn't want my son using it on our wood floors since I was nervous about scratches. Even when it was used on solid surfaces it still only went around once or twice with A LOT of effort. Nothing like I remember as a kid...One positive about this product is that it has some fun music my son liked to dance and bop around to. Other than that I wish I hadn't bought it -- we actually ended up throwing it away when we moved...
2,no good for a kid of 3 years of age,"I bought this for my son and I waste my money. this toy is great for a smaller kid 1 year of age perhaps ,because it says that can support around 25 to 35 pounds ,but he struggle moving the toy ,its suppose to be physical challenge ,but that is to much for a kid I even try to help but the toy can't really support him ,they just want to have fun ,my son is 28 pounds very active boy and has a healthy weigh ."
1,Should have listened to the reviews!!!,"I gave this gift to my 3 year old nephew for Christmas and I am SO dissapointed!! My nephew is definitely a ""boy's boy"" and is really physical and strong. He had the worst time spinning this thing and it never would go fast enough around where he would enjoy it. He actually enjoyed the music but the base is shaped like an oval so when he would try to ""spin the other way"" how Simon would tell him to the sit and spin would get all off balance and actually tipped over a few times. I remember loving my sit and spin when I was a kid. This is nothing like the product that we grew up with, save your money."
3,Not like the original but still good fun...,"We purchased this for my daughter who is 18 months with a gift card from Christmas. Although it does differ from the original as many of the other reviewers have stated. ...The center turn post does not spin as the older models did but remains pretty much stationary which allows my daughter to use it to spin the bottom portion to play the music and spin around...I dont think this would be suitable up to 5 yearsw of age though as the box specifies, more like until 3-4 as then the child would probably be too big to sit comfortably...Although it does hold weight well as my husband stood on it and spun around super fast to teach my daughter how to go and he is around 200 lbs. So for $20 I would say it is well worth it as my daughter has played with it a least a little while everyday since she has gotten it, even if it is just to turn on the music and dance sometimes =0)"
1,Flimsy Piece of Crap-Save Your Money,"This is NOT the Sit-N-Spin you grew up with. The center post is made of a semi-flexible plastic, which makes spinning difficult, at best. When grabbing the top plate, you expect the toy to resist and in turn have your strength propel you forward into a spinning motion. That doesn't happen. Instead, when you pull on the top plate, it bends toward you and there is minimal resistance to use for spinning. Also, the base is not round, it's elliptical, which just adds to this product's awkwardness.The ""interactive voice"" says, ""spin faster,"" or ""spin slowly."" Instead, you good buy a better quality sit n spin, and at the very least, you could interact with the child yourself and call out such lame commands while doing dishes or laundry from another room.Overall, this is an inferior product. I returned it and got my money back. Skip this step and, order something else."
1,This Toy is DANGEROUS!!!,This toy is fun but dangerous. Our 18 month old son broke his arm when he accidentally stepped on it and it launched him across the room.It is not worth it. There is no way to make this toy safe for kids.
2,Not the toy I remember as a child,I bought this in October 2005 thinking that my four year old would have as much fun as I did when ever I got the chance to play with one of these as a child. I was very disappointed when I took it out of the box. It doesn't seem to be made to handle my son's high energy play at all. I don't know if the original Sit n' Spin's center handle came in two pieces and snapped into place on the base unit but this one does. The Playskool version seems as if it's going to break off with one good tug. It hasn't been broken yet but then again it's hardly ever played with. My son's interest lies more in using this as a prop for his Power Rangers. I'm just glad that I bought this on sale with money that someone else gave him for his birthday. My 14 month old seems to like it but of course I have to spin it around for her. Even at her age the interest in it lasts for only two minutes if that. I wouldn't recommend spending your money on it.
1,Sit n Spin - the NO FUN AT ALL version!,"I can see from reading the below reviews that I'm not the only one who hates this thing. What a total waste! I got it for my little one, remembering how much I (and every other kid I've ever known) loved this toy. Well, this version has been made too safe to have any fun on. It barely spins. If you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength, then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day. It's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all. Not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control. Which I could deal with if the thing was any fun at all."
1,Inferior product.,"I purchased this sit'n and spin for our Grandson's third Birthday. When he opened it he was so excited and so were we. However, after my husband assembled the toy we realized it was an inferior product to the sit'n spin purchased for our daughter in the mid-seventies. I cannot even express our disappointment. The material is so weak our Grandson couldn't even make it spin. I really do not understand how a product manufactured in the seventies could be built better then a toy manufactured in the year 2009. The manufacturer really dropped the ball on this toy!! Shame on them!"
3,not the best of its kind,my mother-in-law bought this for my sons first birthday since he loved the musical sit and spin at my father-in-law's. it is very small and he can not sit on it comfortably (although it hasn't stopped him from trying) and it is very difficult for him to spin himself. noisy toys don't bother me so this one's music and talk features do not bother me and it has two sound settings although neither are very quiet. my son still likes this toy despite not being able to use it as it was intended. i have owned this toy for two years and it has held up well. my son and his cousins have a tendency to stand on the orange top part when they think no one is watching and it is surprisingly very sturdy.i think the sit and spin is a great idea however i would recommend a different version.
4,Having Fun With Sit and Spin,Simon Says Sit'n Spin Interactive GameI bought this toy for my nephew who just turned 2 years old. He took to this toy like a duck takes to water. He really enjoyed playing with it. Sue A. Wisse
3,Sit n Spin,"I was disappointed with the size of this toy. The toy didn't fit my nephew's son very well and it was hard for him to sit and enjoy the full effect of this toy. My nephew's son is an average size child and I was careful to get it age appropriate so was very surprised that the toy was smaller than expected and therefore not as much fun as I had hoped for. I'd say for this toy, I would advise getting it in the store where the child can actually try it out."
2,Don't buy it.,"We got this toy awhile ago and my daughter has yet to spin on it. The only thing she's managed to do is step on it, fall, and practically crack her head open. I don't get it.... if she sits on it, it hardly spins at all. But when she stands on it, it spins too much and she almost kills herself. Plus the noise this thing emits is highly irritating. This is not how I remember the Sit N Spin from my childhood."
1,TERRIBLE toy.,"I remember my old sit and spin - THIS IS NOT IT. Poor quality, doesn't spin, obnoxious music. It just sits around because none of the kids are interested in it at all, since it spins so poorly. Terribly disappointing."
1,Don't waste your money... Find an older sit n spin!!!,"My daughter plays with an older round version sit and spin at daycare alot. All the kids like it there. She got the Simon Says version for Christmas from her aunt and it pretty much sucks. She tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she won't touch it and it was in the way. It doesn't spin very well at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my daughter sits on it. Also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control. Also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare. I would say DON'T waste your money on the Simon Says Sit n Spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale. My recommendation to Playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round sit n spin, no sound - just pure and simple fun!"
1,What a Disappointment!!!!,"This toy stinks! I recently bought it for my twin 2 year olds for Christmas and they cant make it turn fast at all, it barely even moves. The oval shape makes for many tip overs if they are not directly on the part where their hiney is supposed to go. The music is way too loud. Overall I can say this toy is nothing like the old style. My girls like some of the other designs they have played with at friends houses, but this one STINKS!"
3,sit and spin,"the item arrived in time but I have talked with my brother (the gift was for my nephew) and he said that it doesn't really spin very well. My nephew still likes that it talks and doesn't really know the difference, but we were both disappointed that ""they don't make them like they used to""."
4,Fun for one!,"My 17 month old loves it. He knows how to use the switch and chooses from one music theme to the other ""simon says"" theme. He can easlity push the half-moon-haped button on the seat to play the music. It is also easy for him to put the sit n spin on the side and turn it from underneath even though he doesn't quite know how to ""ride"" it by himself. We put him on and he squeals when spun. It seems harmless enough. I read the other reviews and have no problems with the sounds but we do have a med. thick carpet so that may mute the sound a bit. However, I do enjoy the silent mode and am happy that it is an option! Is is very easy to clean and store."
1,Worst. Toy. Ever.,"We bought this gadget for our 2-year old. To risk sounding like a broken record--or faulty spinning plastic toy, in this case--I'll just add my vote to the design flaws:1. Volume. Not only is the volume loud, it's unbearably so. Even my daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. The voice is a bit garbled as well, so when the command 'Ready..Spin!' sounds more like 'Wordy...SPEW!' I prefer to spare my daughter's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years, so I've disabled the on/off switch.2. Spin quality. A Sit n' Spin should have a fluid, effortless motion (like a lazy susan). This toy requires enormous effort to turn. To add to my daughter's frustation, the handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened), making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids.Spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and finger paint kit instead."
1,NO FUN!,I bought this for my 2yr old. It is way too hard to spin and barely spins at all! She does not play on it because its just not any fun!This is nothing like the sit-n-spins we had as a kid!Waste of money!!
3,slightly outdated,"The book is already outdated. The inclusion of Pascal was questionable, even in 1997. Outside some universities, Pascal has suffered a continual erosion of mindshare.As for the choice of JavaScript as a scripting language, that still holds true today as a good choice. It is the dominant client-side scripting language for browsers, VBScript and JScript competitors notwithstanding.The unix discussion could easily be modified to include linux. Minor changes here.As for Microsoft DOS, it is a toss up whether this might still be discussed. Perhaps it might be replaced by an explanation of .NET?"
5,Missing In Action.,"This is Squier's bestselling cd overall and for good reason. It contains three hits ""In The Dark"", ""The Stroke"" and ""My Kinda Lover"". The rest of the cd is nearly as solid as those three tracks with ""Too Daze Gone"" and ""Lonely Is The Night"". Unfortunately, Capitol records has deleted all of his catalogue except ""Don't Say No"", which is ridiculous because he had other great cds like 1982's ""Emotions In Motion"", 1984's ""Signs Of Life"" and 1989's ""Hear & Now"" (I have his entire catalogue on cd before they went out of print). Highly underrated artist, and as far as I can tell, still underappreciated. If you want hits, the buy the ""Reach For The Sky"" anthology, otherwise you'll have to be content with this, his only available cd (out of the 8 he recorded with Capitol records). You can also buy 1998's ""Happy Blue"" to see what Squier has been up to lately if you didn't catch him on tour with Styx and Bad Company this summer."
5,Besides being a great listen you can have fun with the titles,"Someone in my SigmaPi fraternity at NCSU had the habit of placing the words BETWEEN THE SHEETS after every song title to see if they made sense and rated the album on this absurd criteria. This got his highest rating ever.Even if this doesn't make any sense or cause a laugh, the music is certainly worthy of praise. Of all my albums, this is always in the emergency travel pack, along with David+David.Despite the help of various talented people, Billy manages to say no to all the influence and sound original. Think about it."
3,'70s rock for the '80s,"There are some solid, Zeppelin-esque hard rock songs on this disc, but the radio hits are the highlights of the album; the deeper cuts are more filler than hidden gems. Squier might not take home any awards for the depth of his lyrics, but that's not why you'd buy this album in the first place.The production is overly biased towards the midrange and treble. This might have been ideal back in the day to help the small 4X10"" speakers mounted under the rear deck of your Camaro cut through the rumble of a big block V-8 piped through glass-packs, but nowadays it sounds a bit harsh and annoying at higher volumes. It could stand to be remastered for better tonal balance.The inside album art is a bit strange. Squier is wearing a leather jacket which has a seemingly disconnected female hand reaching out from inside. Both of his hands are in plain sight. Serial killer chic? Does he use the extra hand to play a double necked guitar? It's a question for the ages.Mullets ahoy!"
2,Boring,This cd sounds great for a while but does not wear well over time. I found myself finding too many parts from other bands.
5,My Favorite Album....Ever.....,"For too many reasons to list here, this tops my list of best album ever. It gave the 80s a soundtrack for me, and set me on the road to all things metal for decades to come. The guitars just scream ""crunch"" and the drumming by the late Bobby Chouinard is some of the best you will find in albums from this decade. Billy Squier can write great rock songs and lyrics, but I don't think he was ever given enough credit for such songs as ""In Your Eyes"" and ""Nobody Knows."" The words in these songs should have been examples for others to follow in rock poetry. Awesome! The remastering gives this album even more shine and punch than it already had....Add this to your library now! You will NOT regret it!"
4,Fantastic!,"Get Real is a wonderful disk with superb lyrics and a truly awesome Bhangra beat. Produced by Harjinder Boparai, and featuring Balwinder Safri (and his band The Safri Boys), one can easy see why this group has such a large international following!All the tracks on this CD are incredible and are guarenteed to keep you dancing! Highly recommended to all, especially newcommers to the Bhangra Beat scene!"
2,Fleeting feeling,Spooky seems to blow any original techno-jazz goodwill mapped out on an excess of attempted artsy electro focused on mumbled atmosphere.
4,"Out there, but melodic","I'm not familiar with any of DJ Spooky's previous work, but I decided to take a chance and buy Optometry one day in a CD store. I don't regret it. The album is very varied in its content, with tracks 1, 2, 5, 7, and 13 being jazz-oriented (though 7 is quite spacey). Track 4 features Carl Hancock Rux doing some beat poetry, and is good. 9, ""Parachutes,"" is a rap number. But this album has some weaknesses, as well. The multiple tracks entitled ""Variation Cybernetique: Rhythmic Pataphysic"" and ""Absentia"" are fairly weak sojourns into the realm of the purely experimental, and are good only for their experimental value. I like this album overall, but I wish the two ""Variation"" and three ""Absentia"" tracks had been cut and replaced with more complete-sounding music."
2,Disapointing,"Not that the music is bad but its a little to soft DJ Cam in most parts. If you like light jazz sort of beats then you'll really enjoy this, but as apposed to most of Spookys other beats its really on the light side. Asphalt and Parachutes are 2 tracks of special mention. The former is a nice piece of trippy hip hop while the later has a really funky groove."
1,Christmas Time with Oleta is Fantastic,"For those of us who love the fantastic voice of Oleta Adams this CD will not disappoint you. As with all of her music she delivers a song like no one else can. It is a MUST have for your Christmas music collection. Once you hear her delivery on these songs you will feel like you have received a true blessing, especially from the song entitled ""Breath of Heaven"". ENJOY!"
4,Oleta number 1,"Only a collection of classics but it's enough to say:""Oleta Adams is fantastic"". A dream? Could I sing with her? At least a conconcert in Europe, please!Great unique voice!!!"
5,"A ""Joyous"" read.","I read this book many, many years ago, but it somehow got lost when I moved to CA.A few weeks ago, I was discussing books with friends, and this one popped into my head. It was so funny and entertaining I just had to buy it again (as pricey as it is), for my collection of favorite books.This is my all time favorite.The Joyous Season"
5,A great Christmas Read!!,"Patrick Dennis is a genius - in fact, I'd recommend another of his books, ""Genius"", too!! I've read and re-read ""A joyous Season"" a number of times, and can't recommend it more highly. The laughs start on just about page one, and keep on until the last sentence. Kerry and Missy are a great team, and the two grandmothers, each so very different, make for a great intergenerational contest.I've been looking for a new copy for some time, and would love to see it re-released!If you see it, buy it!!"
5,precocious wit!,"I always read 5 star reviews with a healthy dose of skepticism. But this definitely earns its stars. I started and finished the book in one day--I couldn't put it down, it was just so good! This book depicts that Manhattanite mid-century lifestyle to perfection and with much hilarity. It is rare to find a book told from the perspective of a child that is believeable and wise. A little reminiscent of some of my favorites: ""Harriet the Spy,"" ""Metropolitan"" and ""Tadpole""."
5,Sad?Happy?Angry? Read this. Can't sleep?pick something else!,"My best friend discovered this book from her mom. She has depened on it for years when she's depressed, stressed, happy, whatever. She introduced Patrick Dennis to me (The Joyous Season, Auntie Mame, etc...) I too now rely on Missy, Kerry, Gaga, Auntie Mame, to get me through. The first 10 or so pages are missing. And as far as I'm concered, always have. My friend assures me there is more. Please help me find out for sure!!!"
2,terrible low light ability,"Ok, I bought this camera to watch my kid in a room while they were asleep. I'm telling you this camera barely shows anything in anything but full light conditions. Horrible. If there is light though, it does ok, hence the 2 star rating. But low light conditions, 0 star. This camera also has buggy software and will not accept your router configuration completely. You must not disable SSID transmission (like I had for security reasons)otherwise the camera doesn't transmit to your router either. Now this is a basic security issue with wireless routers, you should not have to transmit your SSID to everyone in the world, not good for security. So if you only need to have this operational in the day and don't care about details, then it will work. But I personally regret buying it, too expensive for its performance. Very weak in low light, almost ridiculous."
1,Dlink repair,"I have a DCS1000W network camera that stopped working about a year after I bought it. When I called Dlink about repair they said it was out of warranty (which I already knew) and that they had no repair facility. When I asked them how to get it repaired, the answer was ""we do not repair them"" just throw it away and buy a new one. An expensive lesson.............."
1,Terrible tech support,This turned out to be a very expensive ball point pen for us. We could not get it to work due to software problems (we think). Technical support was just dreadful. Please do not buy this pen if you think you would ever need any kind of technical support.
2,"Poor Software, Terrible Tech Support","We've had nothing but trouble trying to get the pen to connect to a PC. We've tried 4 different PC's and out of them all, only one would connect properly. Unfortunately, that one is not available on a regular basis, so at this point best features of the Fly Pen are inaccessible.We've tried contacting support both via Phone and E-mail and had no success.Having said all that, if the LeapFrog people can iron out the technical problems, this is a great toy. My son currently has a love-hate relationship with it. He loved it when he had access to the one computer that it worked with, and he also loves the stand alone functionality, but it's been extremely frustrating to have so many problems and such poor support."
5,I got it its the best thing ever,"Any one who says thiis isnt good has never seen a great present. I got htis for a present and it was unbelivable!!!!!!! I could play music study for test everything.Also this helpd with states and capitals I am now the ace geogerfy kid in the class. My parents thinks its very educational and very easy to work so Id give it 5 stars to bad i cant rate it 1,000,000,000 stars. By the way my dad saya its cheep for all the things it includes. And you can buy more paper for only like $5.95 its AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,great!!!!!but a little bad.,"It is ssssssoooooooo cool!!you can do all kinds of neat stuff!Except there's one flaw.It costs 100 dollars for the pen alone.And by the time you get an expansion pack or two, that's another 40 bucks down the drain.I think it's really fun, but the price is a little too much."
4,First pen computer???,"Ok now listen if you want this toy you have to have patience. This is not a computer, its an advanced laser. About 25% of the time it cant read anything. Other than that its great! The voice is clear. Theres so many cartridges you can buy!"
3,i wonder,"yes the fly pen seems very cool. but i think it might cost a lot more than people think after you get all of the things that you have to have with it. like a recharger, expansion packs, and then all of the software that you have to have to play games and homework help. those are all seperate things. so i dont know.. it seems cool but i wonder if it might be a rip off."
4,kool,"My little bro got it. It is preaty kool. with all the things u can do with it. he loves it. i kinda like it, too."
2,Does Not Work!!,"This pen does not work. I got it for Christmas. We took it back already because when I wrote with it, I pressed on the word and it did not talk."
1,A real kids review,The reviews I have read hear are written by sales men not people. I have a pentop computer in my hand right now and it does not work. If it did work we would have to buy lots of other stuff. Not a good guift.
3,Is it really worth the money?,"I may only be 11, but hey, I know alot. As seeing the pen on the television many times, but not actually owning one, I can't know to much, but I can tell you what I think.This pen is $100. Alot.But then you have to buy the paper, and ink. It can get expensive.Just like any other toy, it will get old. You'll play with it for the first week, show it to Johnny and Susie down the street, and then it will be on your desk, forgotten.So think, IS IT REALLY WORTH THE MONEY?"
1,Fly Pentop Computer Stinks!!,"Everything that people say that the pen can do..... it can't! Don't buy this item because you will probably rip the box open and lose it so you can't return it. You will end up loseing 100 dollars of your money! When i received this bad pen i was very excited, but when I tryed to write with it........ it was no different than any other pen. Remmber, its a waste of your money and time to buy this. LISTEN TO ME! Oh yeah, it also doesn't come with any f the things that it says it should. Fly Pentop Computer STINKS!"
3,not sure,"i dont have one, but overall this item seems ok. i think the concept of having a computer in a pen is cool,but for entertainment purposes only. being able to play an instrument with it seems cool. but i have one question: what if you're a horrible artist? will the computer recognize it?"
1,Not a good present,"First off we wish we could give this ZERO stars!!! My brothers and I each got one for an early present this year. We all wish we could take them back but the store won't take it because the factory seal on the box is broken. We think the fly pen stinks! It doesn't respond well, it is kinda hard to understand how to use. When we learned how to use it we thought it was boring and wasted alot of paper trying to get it to work. It sounded way cool at first but once we got it and tried it out it was a TERRIBLE, AWFUL, HORRIBLE present! Not fun like we thought it would be. Don't believe the other reviews, most are from people who think they want one, but don't even have one."
1,Buy everything at one time,I wanted to buy this thing for my sons educational needs but only for spelling and math so I thought I would just purchase those cartridges. I have since gotten rid of the thing because I did not have a cord or software or paper... always needed something more and the confusion really comes from there are two different pens and all the products are not compatible.
2,so many fake reviews,"this pen is neat like you can write words on its special paper and it will activate functions that you tell it. Like if you draw an M and circle it you can get the pen to go to the menu.But it's very expensive, for all the accessaries put together you could buy a real game system or upgrade a computer. Mine ran out of batteries alot, which kinda sucks, but good thing is i have lots for other toys.also i think like there are lots of fake reviews here, it's so obious. like when some kid review tells you to buy it for you child age 8-13 or something. Anyways if you have the money and can not find a better educational toy then it's neat. just remember to get lots of paper too."
3,Its a waste,Ive been begging my mom to buy this and she said she would. I look on the internet to see how much it cost and then my eyes got wide! $150.00 they are out of there mind! and that is not even for the paper and stuff yet. Iam telling you its cool but exspensive!
1,this stinks,everyone says this is great but it stinks it is $99 who will pay for that? also you have to buy fly paperthis toy sux.
4,Its great,"I love this item,me and my siblings play it all day long. Thank you so much. It rocks-Cindy"
1,Where are the replacement ink cartridges,I bought a fly pentop for my daughter and she can't use it because it won't write. I have been searching the internet for a customer service number or somewhere to call but have come up with nothing. Can someone help?
5,WOW!!!!,"When I was thinking about getting the Fly Pentop Computer for Christmas, I was wondering on how well it worked. I was a little worried that it would be hard to use.This year for Christmas I got practically EVERYTHING that will go with the computer. It is SO WORTH IT!!!! It is easy to do the basics with it and all you have to do is read the manual and then, BANG, you got it!!! My parents and I are so amazed about what this computer can do. This computer also comes with (recharging kit) some notebook paper, instructions, games, and the fun ""skratch kit.""You can also buy studyguides separately. It works really well, and I would suggest you buy it!!!! :)"
3,Flypentop Customer support,"For the person looking for support because their pen does not writehttp://www.flypentop.com/Our customer service call center is available Monday through Friday, 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM and Saturday 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Pacific Time. Call 1-800-701-5327."
2,not for technically handicapped people,"If you can't figure out anything about technology, this is a complete waste of time. Neither I, nor my 10 year old have been able to figure out what to do with this item. I bought most of the extras and they just sat in their boxes. You really have to take a long time and be determined to learn how to use the pen. It looked easy when I saw it on QVC, but it didn't turn out that way for us. A disappointment here."
5,I'm getting it for chanuka,this fly pentop computer thing seems cool but is it really expensive!? no it's not. you might think it's expensive but think about the x-box 360 and other stuff. buying paper for it almost every month might be expensive though. I decided not to buy any extras like notebooks and games until I know if it works. I cant wait until I get it.
5,The BEST gift I ever got!,"For all of you little children that say it's not cool, you probably didn't even read the INSTRUCTION MANUAL. There is one. You need to UNDERSTAND how to use this before you can use it/have fun with it!I actually took the time to READ the INSTRUCTION MANUAL. Once I did, I totally had fun with it! You can do so many things with this pen. It's the greatest pen.You can do othe following IF you just read the INSTRUCTION MANUAL and understand it:Play games (with FLY notebook paper sold seperately)Write notes (with FLY notebook)Write a schedule (with FLY notebook)Draw things and it plays the sounds (with FLY notebook)and so, so much more!So PARENTS, I suggest that you work with your child and read the INSTRUCTION MANUAL. It is NOT a waste of money! You just need to understand it.There is more then the FLY pen. You can buy the notebook paper, the Journal, and there is so, so much more out there!I enjoyed this pen, and I love it. It's NOT a waste of $$$!-Melissa"
5,Wonderful book!,This book will truly inspire your faith for healing as you read about some of the toughest cases that medical science had no cure for. You'll laugh rejoice cry at the wonderful works of God!
4,Nice Memories/Good Songs,"I'm a big Helen Reddy fan. Her voice is very smooth, yet warm, expressive, and unique. As a kid in 70s, my mother was a big Helen Reddy fan. Yes, my mom is an ""I Am Woman"" type! She used to play one of Helen's albums and I vividly recall singing along with ""Leave Me Alone"" and ""Delta Dawn"" with my sister and brother, not knowing what they were about. But I don't think my appreciation of Helen is just nostalgia. She is a talented lady who had something to say. It would be nice to hear from her again. Remember when pop stars were like that? When they really sang?"
2,stupid,I didn't even finish it and I am a great SRK fan. Quality was poor as well. I guess I will stick to his newer films
3,Stick with the Platinum pans!,"I was given this pan by a friend who only used it once when some of the dark non-stick coating started to come off of one cup. I used this pan (not the damaged cup!) and a new Nordic Ware platinum bug pan I had just bought. I made half a batch of yellow cake in each pan at the same time. The cakes in this pan overly browned while the insides were still a bit under done. The platinum bug cakes came out just beautifully. The cakes didn't stick in either pan, but the results from the platinum pan were far superior."
5,Heavy Duty,"Nordic Ware baking pans are very pretty and of high quality. I own quite a few pieces by Nordic Ware.The first one was an accident buy and became hooked with this brand. For the pans that have designs such as this one, I use a brush for easy cleaning.I don't use them just for baking but for gelatin molds, ice molds, and a variety of food that can be mold into these beautiful designs pans."
2,Disappointed,"I own several Nordic ware baking pans and I have been very pleased with their nonstick interior. Unfortunately can not say the same about this pan. When i first baked using this pan I had trouble getting the cakes out of the pan (especially from the rose cavities), I blamed myself for not greasing the pan properly. But the same happened the second time when I made sure that the pan was greased well...so, i am returning this itemI am still giving this pan 2 stars because it bakes evenly."
5,Better than expected!,"I was very pleased with the quality on this set. It does not look cheap or tacky at all and it's a great price! The wood is finished with varnish, the lids screw on easily and tightly. The caddy idea is nice. I would recommend this to all!"
5,Probably the Best Autobiography I Have Ever Read!,"This is a great book for anyone who is interested in Milton Friedman, economics, The University of Chicago, twentieth-century intellectual history, university politics, or rags-to-riches stories. Both authors have led very interesting lives and the tone throughout the book is upbeat and positive. This is one of the best and most-influential books I have ever read. Milton Friedman is one of the most clear-thinking, intelligent people of the twentieth-century and our country would be better off if more of his ideas on economics, education, and freedom were put into practice."
2,"Nice book, but the quality of the book was not as good as it labelled","I like the book. But the quality of the book was not as good as I expected. It was used as a collection from a library. The cover sleeve was missing, and the cover was loose."
1,Very Boring,"More of a travelog than an interesting business book. I could not even finish it, which is very unusual for me."
5,excellant earrings,"Just as pictured, but even better in person,beautiful detailed 3-D charms. not life size of course as hanging from ears but cute as can be for anyone with a passion for sewing.Excellent value for sterling 3-d beautifully detailed earrings."
1,Corny Hill - Leaden Yawns Box Set,"If you're looking for those great Benny Hill skits, save your sixty bucks. These excerpts are from later episodes of BH, in the eighties, and are filled with watered-down, politically-correct shadows of the original show's great raw sketches. We opened two of the tapes and shipped the rest back, eating a whopping 50% restocking fee (+ shipping) for our troubles. But even that beat having to endure another minute of this mind-numbing pap. I don't know which collection contains the classics we grew up with, but this is definitely not it. --- Disappointed"
4,A Promising Debut from a Star in the Making,"Passionate from an early age about the American Song genre, Draxl was 'discovered' in a masterclass here in Australia. Critically-acclaimed performances in the 'Oak Room', and other Cabart venues followed, and he landed a five record deal with Sony. The album covers many of the standards, with especially touching performances of 'Pure Imagination', 'Ordinary Miracles', 'No One is Alone' and a new song from Craig Carnelia, 'Flight'.Cabaret is not dead - it lives on in the voice of this passionate young 18-year with the world at his feet. If you are passionate about the American song, see what the best of emerging Australian talent has to offer."
3,"good start, but needs to mature","There is no doubt that young Tim finds a wonderful joy in the older American song, but at 17, his voice is not yet mature enough to cope with some of the nuances of these songs. A couple of years time and there will be an awesome talent unleashed.I do like the the version of ""I only have eyes for you"", and ""ordinary miracles"" is done justice. I note that he is being guided by those who handled David Campbell in his early years. Tim isn't in that class yet, but I'm sure that the people behind him think he has the goods. Perhaps a bit more original/contemporary material might work better next time. It's still great listening for a cold winter's night snuggled up up to the one you love."
4,Young guy makes good,"Well. Sit back and relax to a collection of standards sung by a casual stylist with a fine range and masculine delivery of some of the sweetest songs around. What strikes a listener first is perhaps the combination of youth and newness (if that is a word), since Tim brightens the racks of easy listening re-re-rereleases of songsters who have aged like poorly corked wine.Among the finer moments...""Pure Imagination"" and ""As Time Goes By."""
2,Beautiful but easily breaks!,"Beautiful dishes...great shape...BUT they break incredibly easily. These are NOT microwave safe, regardless of what it says. The black areas of the plates, mugs heat up incredibly hot (we've had several people burned warming up items on these) Even dishwasher use has caused deep cracks in the plates...maybe the glaze isn't watertight. (?) The shape is great, BUT they chip and crack so easily just with moderate use. I have service for 12, and its the same thing with all of the sets. Very breakable. Okay if you want to hand wash and use occasional. Definitely Not for everyday use."
2,Beautiful when new but not for long,"These are gorgeous when they are new and so we made the mistake of buying a few sets. That way, as we slowly brake a few of them (who doesn't)we could replace them and keep a full set. We do this with everything we like especially glasses. BIG MISTAKE! I have had Mikasa and other porcelain and stoneware brands for decades, which still looked new (if they weren't chipped). These have a very poor short lasting finish. As someone who does pottery, I have no idea how they got such a short lasting finish on these plates. In under a year the black started getting whiter and whiter and now the plates we use the most often look sick compared to the new ones. If Amazon had a way to post a photo, I would love show you the difrference."
1,Not so hot . . .,"When my husband and I bought a new house we bought this new plateware set from our local Target store. That was about a year ago and we only have 1 of the large plates left and one of the small plates broke. This was not all due to dropping or anything like that. I was under the impression that they were microwave/dishwasher safe. Two of the large plates cracked. One of them I had food on and was cutting meat and it broke right in two. One of the large plates I just pulled out of the dishwasher to dry off and put in our cabinet, but noticed that it too was cracked, so I just tossed it. I'm very glad that we didn't buy two sets as we had originially planned or that would have been a big waste of money. I would not really recommend this dinnerware set."
1,Pretty but cheap,I had a mug explode with hot soup in my lap. I've lost 4 plates 2 bowls and many chipped corners. BEAUTIFUL dishes but dangerous. We've owned them for just over a year.
1,"I know I'm clumsy, but seriously!!!","Alright, my girl friend owns a set of these and I am a little clumsy, however I managed to break a salad plate, dinner plate, bowl and cup from this set. It is ridiculous how fragile these are. Take my advise and get a cheaper and better quality set of Corelles."
2,Poor Quality but beautiful,"Don't waste your money! Like others have said, they crack very easily and are NOT microwavable. We have had our set for about a year and are now going to replace them....should have replaced at 6 months since they look so terrible. Last straw was another one cracked down the middle while microwaving something....and the food was hardly hot! Target sells these and many other reviews indicate the same experience. I am surprised they have not been discontinued at this point!"
1,Bad quality bad design bad product overall,"I purchased the sixteen piece jade dishes. The plates are curved up on the corners which they look nice, is a terrible design. I bought these dishes 4 months ago and all my salad plates are broken and only have 2 dinner plates left. The corners of the dishes just kept breaking off. The mugs held up ok, but i have never put them in the microwave, but i did put the plates in the microwave, so I know that they fell apart. The only thing that has held up are the bowls, but they are square and does not hold a lot of salad or cereal. Overall, I think these plates suck, and arent worth the money. I am online shopping for new plates. I am so disappointed in these! please dont get sucked into the pretty design like I did! all you will have in your cabinet is square plates missing 2 or more corners!!"
4,brief overview of physical exam,"nice small size to be able to take with you. pictures were useful. i wouldn't spend the money on the larger bates (ooops). as a second year med student, this had all i needed to learn the major components of a history and physical"
3,Era 1 is better!,"Although I like Era very much, I think that they failed to make the perfect sequel to their 1st cd. The music is less catchy and slightly boring. ""Divano"" is my favorite song on the cd. I don't want to completely trash the cd, but I think I'll listen to ""Era 1"" for now. I'll have to listen to the new one again all the way through a couple of times. Most likely, like other music, the cd will grow on me soon enough.So, before you buy the cd, try to listen to it before buying it. You won't be as disappointed as I was."
4,if u want to feel awsome buy this cd,"i bought this cd before 5 days and all i can say is its amazing actually the first era cd (era) was really special and have an amazing ballads , but this one is better , this kind of music u have to listen when u are out of work and out of pressure it makes u concitrate in yourself this cd start with a very slow guitars and keep on to a wonderfull song (no 2 -divano)-more groovy style the no6 song -infanati is really amazing and have a great words the no9 song - miere mani was in their first cd but the version here is more groovy and better than the first one but i really mean what i wrote in the title - this cd is really special and i think everyone who listen to era first cd MUST buy this one"
5,controversial but RIGHT!,"EXCELLLENT PERSPECTIVE ON IJOHN. NOT TRADITIONAL IN WRITERS VIEW BUT CONTEXT IS FOLLOWED CORRECTLY IN HIS CONCLUSIONS. READ IT WHILE I WAS IN BIBLE COLLEGE AND CAUSED QUITE A STIR WHEN FIRST RELEASED. TO QUOTE ONE OF OUR TOP PROFESSORS, ""NO ONE CAN SUCCESSFULLY REFUTE THE AUTHORS INTERPRETATION OF I JOHN 1:9. A VERY ENCOURAGING VIEW."
5,Exciting and best novels,"This is the best novel I have ever read. It is very different from other authors. His story is so interesting that you cannot bear to stop at a particular chapter. You would like to go on and on to find out what has happened. I even shiver when I read the way the killer does his killings. It would make an excellent movie. This is strongly recommended and if you are not daring enough, try to avoid reading at night alone."
2,A disappointment,"This could have been a fine book had it been a hundred pages thinner. The plot was interesting, the characters well conceived, but then it falls apart after a few hundred pages. It's as if the publisher told Airth to make it longer. Stuff in a romantic interest, drag out the climax ""Jason"" style. It's not a ""page turner"" unless you turn from page 250 to the end. Airth needs an editor with some Moxie."
2,Could have been so much better,"This book started out good with clear writing and a scary killer, but, it came to a too easy to figure out conclusion. And, at 386 pages, it is way too long for a mystery! It should have ended sooner. After a certain point it dragged on. The author is a reporter and I thought that maybe he gets paid by the word! The female lead was somewhat unbelievable with her romantic abandon, considering her position in the community and in that era. If I come across the second book, I hope that it is a shorter, more suspenseful read."
2,plodding and contrived,"I love complex mysteries (a la P. D. James), but this was too ploddingly slow and depressing, heavy. And the relationship with the woman was unrealistic and contrived and rather disgusting. Rather than enjoy the positive aspects of her education (self-determination, etc.), she simply acts like a subservient needy harum girl to the detective. It was painful to read: Degrading rather than enpowering."
3,Ambitious river of tedium,"Rennie Airth's ""River of Darkness"" is an ambitious book. it wants to be a good psychological thriller while also being a good post World War I novel. Well, that fails. The psychology is sound, as the hero, John Madden, learns of what could be driving the killer. Madden is a haunted widower who is also scarred mentally from war. His love interest is also scarred in her own way, and she is also unconviningly forward with Madden. It seems so out of place. The history here is the best part. Airth does get the zeitgeist of 1920s Britain right. His characters, on the other hand, are flat and boring. The killer, who we meet early, is a one-trick pony. That really isn't interesting. Predictable maiden-in-distress as climax, and very predictable ending."
1,"Plot is too similar to Thomas Harris ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""","This book felt very familiar, and with one third of the book left I realized it was essentially the same story as ""Red Dragon"" (with a time sequence from ""Silence of the Lambs"",) by Thomas Harris. This might be entirely a coincidence, but still...it left a bad taste.(Spoiler warning) Here are some similarities:-Family is stalked and massacred in both books in a very similar way.-Similar detective character in both books.-Similary sexually obsessed psychopath in both books.-The crux of the mystery is the mechanism by which the assasin comes in contact with the victims. This is very similar (home film development technician in ""Red Dragon"", family portrait painter in the other).-Interleaving of events by which the detective visits the assasin, while the police raid the wrong house at the same time is very similar."
1,River Of Darkness,"Rennie Airth's ""River Of Darkness"" is one of the finest detective stories that I have ever read....excellent writing and an extremely well conceived plot....all characterizations truly believable.....Amos Pike is unforgettable.....The product was in new condition....a really good buy....Ron BlackNorth Bergen, NJ"
5,Just what I needed...,"It did not come in a retail package, but fit perfectly and working fine so far. It looks just like one I have on my Lamy."
2,Do not use a cannon to kill a mosquito...,"Am I missing something here? What is with all these positive reviews? This is the most laborious book I have ever let grace my senses. It is required reading for one of my classes, but there is absolutely NO in depth analysis of the statistical data presented. It is a VERY pedestrian and pedantic review of some very real common sense. Here is the whole book in a nutshell: The worse off you are in society, the worse your health is in this country. Now if you feel like you need 300 pages of graphs you'll probably never look at (because they are painstakingly described in text anyways), or you really want to know exactly how much more likely you are to have chronic illness if you are black, poor, and uninsured, then be my guest and buy this book. Just don't say you weren't warned. This book is only useful if you need a large source of recompiled stats and data on the topic."
3,Great for the public health nurse!,"I am not a public health nurse, I am an ICU nurse at heart. However as doctoral student, this text was required for a course I am currently taking. It truly opened my eyes to vulnerability even within the US. With the recent and current national crisis and disasters, the concepts discussed are brought home."
3,CD1 5 Stars. CD2 2 Stars,"As the title says, cannot complain about CD1. The original melodic/trance sounds of CD1 contrast sharply with the overly funky, commercial, irritating sounds of CD2. Would not recommend, but would find suggest another compilation with similar content as CD1."
5,"""Blessingways"" builds sisterhood and honors motherhood","Not only does Maser inspire us to create beautiful, personalized ceremony for our pregnant friends and family, she writes about the process with wisdom and simplicity. I bought ""Blessingways"" to give as a gift, but found myself reading it diligently. I am not pregnant, nor do I have close friends or family who are expecting; and yet I was engaged entirely by the history, stories and creative suggestions included in this wonderful book. Every woman should own a copy of ""Blessingways"", and every woman should consider offering the incredible gift of a blessingway to her loved ones."
3,It's a great field manual...but I did hope for more in the way of narrative,"It's a thorough book, and an effective tool for identifying different shark species. I do wish it was styled as more of a narrative; fewer species keys and more paragrahps."
4,Gift,I purchased this book as a gift for my son who has had a great interest in sharks since he was a small boy. He is now 22 & asked for this book as it contains so much information
2,"If you actually need to protect your keys, get something else!","I got this to keep some office keys secure but allow access to people who needed it. This seemed good in principle, but failed in a lot of ""key"" (haha) ways.Pros:- CheapCons:- The loop part makes it easy to slip off of some doors- The cheap plastic is easily breakable- I know the cheap plastic is easily breakable because I had to break it to get my keys out when it refused to open!"
4,Great little item,I've locked myself out of the house at least 3 times over the last 12 years. My dad finally got me this stor-a-key. I haven't had any problems with the cable releasing when it's not supposed to. It fits securely on the handle with the adjustable cable. I'm only giving it 4 stores because a better design would have been to put the combination on the front/back instead of the sides. Would be easier to access and see.
1,Reset Access Code,I forgot the access code. The instructions don't include how to reset the code other than that of manufacturer. The lock is no use to me now since I can't open it. I take responsibility for current issue. Any recommendations?
2,A LOCK?,"a very basic lock. this will keep a key secure, but if they want it w/o the combination.....a large rock or pliers......ta daaa.....key!"
3,"Ok, not designed for large car keys",Sadly only one of two of my car keys (the reason for the purchase) fit in the lock. The large round ends of the clicker simply don't fit. And only one car key will fit at a time.
3,Disappointed - the cable tether is not very secure,"I was disappointed that the cable tether on this product was not very secure. While the product is locked, if you depress the cable release button and then simultaneously pull on the cable tether on one end and the door on the other end with some force, the tether would come out.If you simply need the tether to hold the item in place and don't expect it to be theft resistant, then this product will be ok for your purposes as the contents will still be protected by the combination lock."
1,Cheaply made,You get what you pay for. Not very secure as it is made of cheap plastic. Ordered 2 sent 1 back.
2,Flimsy but does the job,"If someone wanted to break this open to get your key, it wouldn't be that difficult. The plastic piece that holds the bottom in is flimsy. I would recommend keeping this item out of plain site since it isn't very secure. It is still better than keeping a key with no combination so works for a cheap and quick solution. There is foam on the inside that can make the key very difficult to remove. We ended up cutting the foam out so it was easier to get the key. This product is best if you live in a safe area and are just looking to keep a spare key outside for lockouts."
3,plastic lock,"The ""GE Security 001860 Portable Stor-A-Key with Adjustable Cable, in Blue"" is a neat idea, however, now I know why it was so reasonably priced...it is made mostly of plastic!!! In my opinion, not a really good choice of material for a security device! Was hoping for ""die-cast metal"" at the very least. Shipping/delivery was fine and it usually is with amazon. Packaging could have been a bit more dense considering that the device is made of plastic. Other than that,for now it's a handy item and only time will tell if it will do the job of protecting.Y4E4SHUA@yahoo.com9-29-10"
4,Everyone needs one of these gadgets,"Ok, it's a key storage gizmo. It opens and closes, and holds my key just fine. I've not had any problems with it. It's just nice to have somewhere to keep a spare key."
1,Cheap and easily breakable,"So this review was based on user error as I completely forgot the code that I had set. After trying for a while I gave up and left it be for a couple of weeks. Then one evening I lose my keys, so after trying to get the code to no avail I decided to go at it, within a minute I had the device pulled away from the steel railings it was 'secured to' and within about another 6 minutes I had it open, this was with using a cheap Swiss army nice that was in my laptop bag. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not her best effort,"A spirited dowager rents a summer home that may be haunted -- or may be the target of a master criminal. ""The Bat"" recycles many of the plot points and character types of ""The Circular Staircase,"" but in my opinion, isn't as well-conceived. Pervasive, offensive depictions of the Irish and Japanese servants also detract from the story."
3,"A clumsy, old-fashioned mystery, but fun.","The setting is almost identical to ""The Circular Staircase"" but more confined, which allowed for its later adaption for the stage. In fact, I get the sense that the author was contemplating a stage play as she wrote the novel."
5,loved the old fashion mystery format,"This was really good. there was times when people talked to much and didnt get to action or plot, but enjoyed it through out the reading. The Killer was a surprise. good ending and it's free for Kindle."
1,Muddled and pretentious,"Reading this overwrought first nocel is like trying to wade your way through a swamp of molasses. It's meant to be lyrical and deep, but it's actually rather shallow and verbose. The basic plot is nothing special, and the characters never grab you. Disappointing."
3,A good read from an author worth watching in the future.,"Draper obviously knows the Texas prison system. His writing style (especially the manner in which he handles the dialogue between characters)makes some of the reading a little uncomfortable, but the sarcastic humor he directs at the system makes it worth the trouble. I'll try his work again."
2,Growing up watching Rickey in the Bay area...,"I really liked watching Rickey play ball for the A's. He was a great ball player, not a great storyteller. The book is decent, but I would not recommend it to anyone other than the most die-hard Henderson fan."
5,Great Book From About A Future Hall Of Famer!,"If you love Rickey, you have to buy this book! A great look at Rickey as a person and a ball player! It makes for an interesting read, and an exciting look at one of the greatest careers of all time.This is a great read for Rickey fans, or for young baseball fans everywhere!"
2,kathie lee schloppy,"As usual, this is a bit of a self serving book about Kathie Lee and her trials and tribulations. I do like Christian books that are hopeful and believe in the Lord, but this is sort of desperate KL stuff because basically she has no career to speak of. It's about frank's cheating, her two darling children, and her troubles in life. But it get monotonous and really isn't uplifting or optimistic, rather sort of self pitying in my opinion."
2,Disappointing,"These seemed like a great idea to use on the motorcycle, even though I saw the one less than enthusiastic review for that application. Bolstered by the other thumbs ups, I decided to give it a shot. I have both the Midland GXT710 GMRS and the 75-822 CB, and after contacting Midland about their wiring and respective headset/mics I grafted the Midland 22-540 headset's connector (that headset is impossible to use with a 1/2 shell helmet) to this headset using keyboard-style mini-DIN connectors so I could swap the headset between radios using their own cables and PTT switches. The mic output is really low even for the GMRS radio it is designed for. I thought it might be my soldering, but the identical operation was noted using the second, unmodified headset. The mic on radio itself was much louder. Pretty much a waste of money in my opinion."
5,excelente servicio. El producto es de buena calidad y a un buen precio. los recomiendo. excelente servicio. El producto es de,excelente servicio. El producto es de buena calidad y a un buen precio. los recomiendo. excelente servicio. El producto es de buena calidad y a un buen precio. los recomiendo.
3,Midland AVPH5 Headsets,"The headsets work good but the ""push to talk"" buttons on the wire do not work well. When used they make the transmission sound scratchy and garbled. The headset wire that wrap around the head are a little big even for my large head. Maybe the problem is that I am comparing them to the higher quality ""and priced"" ones that we use in the fire dept by that other manufacturer that starts with ""M"".We use them to talk from our labors to machine operators in our landscape business. Radios sure beat hollering back and forth.All in all they get the job done if you use the transmit button on the radio and they are a hundred times better than the little ones that hang off your ears that came with the radios."
5,Great headsets,We have been looking for headsets to give us handsfree operatings at our model railroad club. These Midlands fix our needs perfectly. The are very comfortable and easy to operate. Great product !!
4,SO... SO...,"The boom is too short,they do not match the picture and are not adjustable. However they do seem to work ok,not for use were there is alot of talking/music. Good for fishing/hunting ect..."
5,Good for MilSim,"I used this headset for a 3 day Airsoft MilSim event in SoCal called Red Storm 2. After getting the wires just right, the headset was completely comfortable and worked like a charm. I've gone through so many headsets for all different radio types and this is the only one I plan on using from here on out. I was able to have my bitter-end goggles on and my blue beret and the behind the head headset and didn't have to worry about a thing. Highly recommended."
4,A Must Have...,This is an awesome product. The microphone is adjustable creating great reception.Please Note: The head band is NOT adjustable. This may create difficulties in positioning on the ear. Other than that AWESOME AWESOME!
4,Pretty decent,"I'm sure everyone remembers this song being played everywhere back in 1995. Although the subject matter wasn't the most original, the song became something of a guilty pleasure. The video remix is also on here, but it doesn't have Grand Puba's rap in it. I was mad about that at first, but later I decided it was probably better that way because the rap was really lame (and unnecessary)."
2,"Disappointment, somehow.","I was super excited when I first heard that this was coming out. I absolutely love the Descendents. I downloaded 'Cool to be You' and was a little concerned and excited, Milo didn't sound the same. I downloaded 'Nothing with You' and was a little more optimistic. I bought the 'Merican EP and thought it was alright, but a little mediocore for a Descendents CD. This CD came, I put it in and after a short time, it came back out. Something vital to the Descendents is missing on this CD. I've listened to it more and am not satisfied. I was at least hoping for a CD as good as Everything Sucks, if not better. I'm just hoping they will tour and these songs will be proven to be good live."
5,simply awesome f*ck*n awesome!,"Well!, that's my swecond review for this CD, but you know when something please you... well for the second time I gotta say that this is simply the best punk record that have been recorded since the beginning of the new millenium the PERFECT POP-PUNK ALBUM!!!!!"
2,Not that good,"Ok..first off....I've always been a huge Descendents fan. I bought everything they ever put out when it came out...(im old). This is by far the worst record they have ever done. I can't even believe it's them. Very uninspired and uncreative. The lyrics, riffs, energy, and excitement is just not on this record. Why couldn't they be that band that put out the ""ALL"" album? You can argue all you want...but I would bet money that if you like this record you are way under 25 years old. I'll give it two stars only because they are still actually putting up the effort."
5,the godfathers of pop punk,"This isn't the best Descendents album, maybe one of their worst. But it's still great because its the Descendents and it is pretty addicting. Don't expect Milo goes to College or even Everything Sucks. Any Descendents fan or punk rock fan in general should own this album. None of that other pop ""punk"" out there even compares. Also get the 'Merican ep. The 3 non album songs are some of the finest songs they've put out I'm sad they weren't on Cool to be You. It would have made it that much better."
2,Disappointing,"I really like ""Everything Sucks"" and ""Milo Goes to College"", but this album is just boring and bland. Of course, it's much better than what poses as punk rock nowadays, but this is certainly the Descendents' worst album. I tried really hard to like it, but it's just not happening. I am a big fan of the Ramones, Misfits, Necros, Damned, etc. and have been a Descendents fan for almost 10 years, so I know what I'm talking about. I'm just hoping that they release another album to make up for this one!"
2,Disappointed,There are a few good tracks on this CD but by far my least favorite All/Descendents CD.
1,"should have stopped at ""Everything Sucks"".",I love the Descendents and thier work. Lets just say that I was very disappionted with this album. It didn't even sound like something Milo would sing. It sounded more like them trying to sound like an unoriginal punk POP (not Milo) band. This album does not give the Descendents justice to what an awesome band they really are.
4,Cool To Be Reviewed,"I've been listing to the Descendents for a very, very long time. I had mixed feelings after listing to this disc the first time. I wasn't thrilled and I thought it wasn't ALL that great. But wait, I said the same thing about ""Everything Sucks"" and as it turns out it's really quite excellent. As any long time fan of the Descendents knows, every new album explores their own stages of life and where they're ""at"" in life. I've been listing to the new disc more and more and every time it gets better and better. I've always related to their songs and the new tunes on the disc are no exception. This may not be the best starter CD for new listeners so I suggest start with ""Milo"" and work your way up in the order of their release. I've always enjoyed how they evolved. That's my 2 cents. Enjoy! ""I want to be stereotyped. I want to be classified."""
1,Moralistic Claptrap!!! Total Nonsense!!!,"This book focuses on how immoral is it to use steroids since they effect the ""fairness"" of sporting events. There is an obvious anti-steroid bias that throws doubt on all of the authors' research and motivations.If you want to have the simplistic ""it's illegal, so it must be immoral"" line regurgitated repeatedly to you, then this book is for you.If you were looking for an objective book on the benefits (and more importantly) the dangers of steroid use, look somewhere else.Ironically, I've concluded (partial from this book) that the worst dangers in using steroids are due to the fact that you can only get them from illegal sources. Not exactly a revelation but, oh well...I don't recommend this book for any purpose. I gave it 1 star since there wasn't a choice for zero."
1,Too much moral,I don't like this book at all. That's too much moralistic... If you wanna write about something really... write it in the neutral way...
2,Not so robust and full of oil,"I use black seed for my health and so look for seeds that are fresh, larger and naturally full of the valuable and healthy black seed oil. These were smaller, not fat and robust and when I ground them, the blackseed meal hardly stuck together which it usually does when the seeds are oily and robust. Not so great for my purposes."
5,An extraordinary reference books about extraordinary novels.,"Anthony Gary Brown's ""Persons, Animals, Ships and Cannon in the Aubrey-Maturin Sea Novels"" is a wonderful resource for anyone who loves the nautical fiction of Patrick O'Brian. The depth and breadth of research evident in this companion volume to the Aubrey-Maturin series is truly awe-inspiring. Every ""proper name"" reference -- no matter how slight or obscure -- has been diligently tracked and, where ever possible the historical reality behind the fictional is revealed. Characters I had assumed to be merely creations of Patrick O'Brian's imagination are shown by Gary Brown to be based in actual persons. Whenever Stephen Maturin speaks of an obscure botanist or philosopher, Brown has explained who he or she was and what was the significance of their work. There are many, many hours of delightful browsing in this volume for any Patrick O'Brian fan."
4,This is the 1st Edition. Buy the 2nd Edition.,"This is the first edition. The second edition has a different title and is much better. Here's the link:The Patrick O'Brian Muster Book: Persons, Animals, Ships and Cannon in the Aubrey-Maturin Sea Novels"
4,Wow there is a whole lot of bang for the buck,This is s really big kit. Seems to be well made. I haven't used it yet but I use to work in a hardware store when I was in college so I am pretty good at spotting junky tools. These are quality.
5,Just Lovely,"First of all, the watch was delivered 2 days after the order was made,and by the way the shipping was free. The watch was so classy it really looked a lot better than the picture.If you want a watch that stands out, this is it. My husband gets a lot of compliment every time he wears it and he just absolutely adore it."
2,Cheap Imitation,"This is a cheap imitation of the Scannon Product and does not even come close to the original. This is bottled in Delray Beach, Florida by Palm Beach Beaute, LLC"
5,Awesome!,"This is the best ice pack I've ever tried-- works really well when I have headaches. Stays flexible even when frozen, stays cold for a couple hours. Very happy! Coming back to order 2 more."
3,"Should be called ""The Strike""","These four episodes concern what happens to the Bunkers when Archie goes on strike and Edith begins working for the Jeffersons. Inflation, unemployment, and changing social status are all discussed with humor and drama."
5,Life Saver for Mother of 9,"Although Critter Friends is not as good as Little Friends and Little Adventurers, I love this DVD! Little Playdates is on to something with these videos. They keep the attention of my young children allowing me to get some things done around the house that I wouldn't normally be able to. 5 stars in my book!!"
1,Little Playdates,Poor quality video - more like home movies and not a very good flow. Content does not seem to be well thought through.
2,Not what I expected,This video is more of a marshal arts form than Qigong. It is hard to follow and requires a partner to do most of the moves since it shows you how to avert a blow or knock someone off balance. The quality of the video was also poor. If you are interested in Qigong looks somewhere else.
5,Experience Transformation & Manifest Your Dreams!,"Part of a transformational home study course! The practice of Qi Dao is not just another exercise program. It is a journey along the way of being free and natural. I knew from the first time I met Lama Tantrapa that what he had to offer was very different from anything I had ever experienced before. To my surprise, practicing Qi Dao has far exceeded my expectations. I now live my life with more joy, freedom, and excitement than I ever dreamed possible. If you take the time for yourself, as I did, and continue your exploration of Qi Dao, I'm certain it will transform your life and empower you to manifest your dreams.~ Kali Samaya Tara, JD, Certified CoachCenter for Conscious Living[...]"
4,"Cassic, Worth Reading, but Dated","This work is one of the classic reviews of the Lacnunga, an Anglo-Saxon magico-medical text. The authors discuss the general background and elements that went into the text and make a number of clear observations about the structures of some charms.Although this book is quite interesting, it suffers greatly from modernist and Romanocentric tendencies. The author is quite scornful of the manuscript and the tradition that produced it, suggesting that it is nothing more than a text of superstitious nonsense.However, this text also discusses the grammar of the Lacnunga, which should be of interest to other scholars of Old English. All in all, this book is of interest to people studying this subject and I would recommend it."
4,Helps somewhat with pulling.,"My little Maltese is a hyper little guy and he constantly pulls on the leash. I had him in a regular cloth harness that protected his neck from the pulling, but did nothing to stop the pulling itself. The Pull-Stop Harness fits under his front legs (and is well-padded to prevent chafing)and when he pulls,his front end gets ""lifted"" a few inches off the ground. This does help with the pulling, but it didn't stop it entirely."
2,The review directly beneath me is erroneous.,"After dark side of the moon was recorded in 1973, the floyd was lured to another record company away from capital records for bigger money. They'd been with capital for all their early works.Capital records, still owning the rights on all music dark side and earlier, decided to cash in on Floyd's new found fame by releasing a compilation.""Works"" was done without Pink Floyd's input, nor did any band members receive any dividends from sale. It is strictly a Capital Records investment. And to many diehard floydians, it's blasphemy because not only did Capital do it on their own, they remixed many of the tracks, such as Brain Damage.Again, without the Floyd's consent."
4,Where Radiohead stole from! Early Floyd brilliance!,"Along with Relics this cd is a great listen. From ambient electronic to tripped out psychedelic folk and rock this is very similiar to Radioheads Kid A and Amnesiac period. Yes its a comp that leaves out alot of essential early floyd stuff but all the tunes are great and i actually like the blending of the tracks. Even though this material is on most of their 67-73 releases its still worth having to pop it in and kick back especially with the rare ""embroyo"" track available only here. I happen to prefer early Pink floyd up until DSOTM so this and Relics are some of my favorites. I recommend Piper at the gates of dawn -Saucerful of secrets- *Obscured by clouds and *More. (*both movie soundtrack works). This set of songs in the order they are hold up well and make great late night rainy day listening!"
1,Don't even bother,"A rubbishy compilation of odds and ends, good songs mixed in with forgettable ones, and all remixed to no good effect. Give this one a pass."
1,one unreleased song,"A couple years back I was a real big Pink Floyd fan, so I bought every album of theirs I saw. This album, I found, is a really pointless one. The one unreleased track on this album is a slow acoustic number that, while a good song, is not good enough to buy the album for, trust me.If you want a collection of singles and unreleased songs by Pink Floyd get Relics. It's a better album in every way and probably costs just as much."
2,The Downloads are HORRABLE!!,"I got all the songs on this CD except ""Embryo"" and when i downloaded the MP3, it skipped & mistracked, then it also counted that i downloaded 2 copies of the track and everytime i asked for help there was always an issue of payment which i already done, they said they opened it up for downloading again but that never happened and when i tried to email them back its ""you cant respond to this email"" all i wanted was a tech support number or something but no i dont even get that. I oughta put just 1 star for lousy service!"
5,A great compilation album,"This album is kind of like Relics, it even has a couple of the same songs as Relics. The songs on this album are from their early albums, from Dark Side Of The Moon down."
4,Do Yourself a Favor...,"Before Shedding tons of moolah trying to buy all of the individual albums, start here. ""Works,"" when listened to in conjunction with the ""Dance Songs"" album (or ""Relics,"" depending on whether you are anti- or pro- Syd Barrett, respectively,) provides a pretty complete collection of Floyd's finest works. You get the timeless singles ""Arnold Layne"" and ""See Emily Play,"" you get the bizarrely catchy ""Several Species"" song without having to shell out $30+ for the rest of the middling ""Ummagumma."" You get the beautiful ""Fearless,"" you get the chilling ""Embryo"" and most of all, you get ""Eclipse"" without having to sit thru filler such as ""On the Run."" Works, of course, is incomplete without ""Relics"" or ""Dance Songs"" to supplement it. but it is one of the few Pink Floyd albums that rank as absolutely essential."
2,Superfluous,"With the possible exceptions of ""Shine On,"" ""Echoes"" and ""Oh, by the Way..."", most Pink Floyd compilations have ended up sounding irrelevant instead of revealing. One reason for this is that the band over the years has developed such strong concept albums that taking songs out of context generally did more harm than good. ""Shine On"" gets a pass from me because the material was remastered and the packaging absolutely superb. ""Echoes"" used that classic PF tool, the segue, to create a compelling mix of songs from the band's career. And ""Oh, by the Way"" collects all the Floyd's 14 studio albums for completists and newbies.""Works"" is a better collection of songs than that found on ""A Collection of Great Dance Songs, and possibly even ""Relics."" But overall, it's a yawner. The only thing of real interest here is the rarely-heard ""Embryo."" If you're going to buy this album, I recommend a cheapie used version."
4,A Decent Introduction to the Early Pink Floyd,"This collection sums up, even if rather quickly the 1967 - 1973 era of the band. It even includes two ""Dark Side of the Moon"" tracks remixed from the quadrophonic version of the album. In short, rather than include a lot of DSOTM tracks (and everyone has heard them a million times) it's a short,decent way to become familiar with the band and branch out to obtain key pieces of their discography."
3,The songs are all good... at least!,"I don't own ""Works"", but I own every other PF albums. All the songs here are great, original from also great albulms. ""Embryo"" might be the only new attraction, but a smart guy knows how to obtain it another way... Pink Floyd deserves to have all their CDs purchased, with the exception of this compilation which was only useful to give money to Capitol."
4,Much more modest proposals than the title suggests,"Okay, I like most readers of this book (I'm certain) first picked it up because the title is catchy. The actual substance of the book is much more modest, and largely centers on hammering the need for campaign finance reform. Along the way, Huffington also trashes pollsters, and emphasizes the need for citizen participation in government and in charitable activities. There really is nothing particularly new or ground breaking here, but Huffington does a nice job of gathering together in one place a lot of anecdotal information about her topics. She bashes politicians of both major parties evenly, and is apparently disappointed that the nominees for the fall elections are Bush and Gore rather than McCain and Bradley. Bottom line: A good read, but don't expect to learn anything that rocks your world. One of her fundamental points -- that the American people have come to expect their political leaders to be a pack of thieves -- is all too true."
2,Lack of the Common Man's Responsibility,"I find a terrible contradiction in Arianna's philosophy. The need for responsibility within government, which she does support, is noticeably absent for the common man. This book reflects that opinion. Do not read this book in conjunction with Ayn Rand or you will find this book to easily defined."
1,Overthrow the gov't by using the gov't?,"Yeah, right, Ariana. If you really want to overthrow the gov't, you have to come up with a better alternative and then use the rules of that alternative to set it up. Also, you play by the rules of the active gov't by using its tactics of preserving 'national security'. This includes espionage, mind control, state-sponsored terrorism, etc... Of course you'll be labeled as a 'terrorist'... But no matter - you can call yourself a 'freedom fighter'..."
1,Sunex 1814 12 Piece 1/4-Inch Drive Universal Standard Metric Impact Socket Set,"poor customer service,,, Bewaretook my money got nothingsay they listed wrong price still should honor themBeware they will rip you off"
2,One size does not fit all,"The description said it was adjustable to fit anyone. I'm 5'6"" about 155 with a 32"" waist and it doesn't even come close to fitting me. The cinch belt says ""Large"" on it and is tightened all the way, so are the shoulder straps and it is too loose. I'll be returning it."
3,"Amazing artwork, Too much NX-01, and strange date layout","The artwork, as always, is amazing. The 2-page spreads look great up close and 10 feet away. Like last year's Ships of the Line, this one features the NX-01 a bit too much.My main reason for not giving it a 4 or 5 star rating is that the actual layout of the dates is non-standard! Instead of the standard five rows of seven days like every other calendar I've seen, the layout artist chose two rows of 15 or 16 days. This makes it a bit harder to glance at the calendar and see just what day ""next Thursday"" might be, forcing the viewer to scan along the line to find the day, labeled in a relatively small font."
1,Too Much NX-01,"With half the images being from the current flop show'Enterprise', I'll have to take a pass on this one. Abetter distribution of subjects would make this a 'musthave', instead it comes off as a cheap marketing ployfor a miserable series."
5,Somewhat better than the movies!,"Written by Batman writer, Denny O'neil, these stories are nearly identical adaptations of the films they are based on and were based on early scripts. They were released to coincide with their respective films. The first 2, Batman and Batman Returns have only minor dialogue and scene changes to make the stories flow better and seem more logical. The last 2, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are the stronger stories because they improve upon the movies dramatically. The last 2 films in this series as directed by Joel Schumacher are widely regarded as ""campy"" or ""silly"" with Batman and Robin being more so. So, the last 2 stories in this volume are written in a much more serious tone to match the tone of the first two.All in all, if you like these movies, buy this book!"
5,A Good Start,I bought this album when I got tired of listening on the radio here in the US and needed something new. This CD was an excellent start and I'm begining to become a strong fan of the band and finding out just how musically talanted they are with all the other projects they do. It is definitly one of my best CD buys. Hope that helps you.
5,Smile,"The first album of Laruku after 4 years of being working on their solo albums. I totally loved it! Kind of dark sometimes, especially on the lyrics (Coming closer) and really touching at others (Living in your eyes/Eien). But the last song I think it's the best. Not only for the lyric, which I personally think, we can relate to, but the music too. My favorite song of the album, altough Hyde-sama's english could be better U_U. Anyway if you are a fan of Laruku you should have this album, a collector's item ^_^"
3,"Decent album, but diluted compared to Satta","3.5 stars. There are some very nice tracks on Dust My Broom. There are some grooved-out tracks that would feel at home on Satta, Boozoo's previous album that was characterized by chill, funky, instrumental, swamp mood music. And there are some nice tracks with guest vocalists that go in slightly different directions. But this follow-up album feels like too many other follow-up albums to me. It seems like these artists get some spotlight from superb debut albums, and then use that success to hire a bunch of guest stars for their next, in an effort to make something more ""grand."" But instead of improving on the originals, these sophomore attempts feel like disparate pieces thrown together in a manner that to a great extent abandons the elements that made the artists successful in the first place. This is a good album, but feels a bit artificially varied, and could never put you in the awed and ecstatic trance that Satta can."
5,Gooooooooooooooood.,Was not dissappointed. I love NIN and this really helps me achieve one step closer in have a plethoria of NIN merch.
4,This book really captures your attention.,"I liked this book because it has an interesting plot. I read it in about 1-2 days. If you don't have anything else to read this summer, read this book! After you've read this book you will want to read the rest of the series. I suggest that you read numbers 1-6 first. Sarah, Age 10"
1,This model is NOT IATA AIRLINE APPROVED,"IATA requires air-holes on all 4 sides of the carrier. This model does not have holes on the back side (which you can't see in the main photo). As a result, I had to drive from Boston Logan to a local Petsmart to purchase new IATA approved crates 2 hours prior to shipping 2 dogs to the UK.Other than that, I suppose they're ok."
2,Not an extra large size,I have a 90 lb dog. I would like to send you a video of her trying to fit inside this crate so you can use for advertisement lol THIS NOT X-LARGE! nice crate tho. Good for puppies or ankle bitters
4,Good airline crate,"The product arrived with no damage and all of the parts. We did not have any problems with assembly. As with any crate purchase, pay close attention to the dimensions listed for the product and animal size recommendations. Also check with the airline for crate size limitations. If you cannot decide upon a crate online, go to a local retailer so that you can match your animal to the appropriate size crate for travel. You will need to order an airline travel kit or two small hanging bowls in order for this to pass airline regulations."
5,A compelling description of pyramid building,This work is by someone who understands stonework and is compelling in its suggestions of how the pyramids might have been constructed.A must read for those interested in this topic.
3,Slow. Really slow.,"I have been a fan of Falco for years, and have followed him all over the Empire, but this time he nearly lost me. The book is 50 - 75 pages too long for its material and proceeds at a snail's pace. I don't normally read courtroom dramas,"" so if that's what this book is, I will make sure not to try any.Here's my parody of how this book is written: ""Three days later, when I picked up the book again, I had to review all of the characters and their situations. There was Tedius Magnus, his daughters Tedia Maxima and Minnia Muscula ..."" and so on.Of course, it's always nice to spend some time with Falco and his gang, but reading this book is like watching the most missable episode of a TV series that you really like, and not being able to mute the ads."
2,Very Disappointing,"Because the writing is literate, I would have rated this book a ""3"" but for my high expectations when I began reading it. I've reviewed Lindsey Davis' FALCO mysteries before, and always rated them highly--something they deserved--for local color, human interest, scholarship, wit, and unusually good writing.This one goes nowhere. It's plodding, devoid of Falco's usual mental and physical exertions. There's little if any character development except that Helena's brother Aelianus seems to be maturing and mellowing. Falco is acted upon, rather than being his usual competent and courageous self, someone who controls the denouement of the plot. He makes an inordinate number of errors and bad judgments. His actions turn to dust, and at the end nothing really has changed except that a sour widow has unnecessarily died.The humor in all the others is missing here; instead there's a deep cynicism. I'm sure Davis will hit her stride again, but this is the least important novel in the series."
5,Check it out!!!,"All you have to do is listen to""In Your Eyes"" and ""It Keeps You Rockin'"" to know why this album is a must-have for any classic rock fan. Forget the fact it came out in the 80's. It's not stereotypical in any way, shape or form whatsoever.And Billy's voice.......in a word, Wow!"
4,Worth waiting for,"This CD is hard to get for some reason. The release date on my CD is 1982. The CD is excellent, many old songs that you don't get to hear quite often on any station. It's a great purchase if you can get your hands on it!"
4,Love this,Package came quickly and it was great to have this blast from our past. I gave it to my husband for Christmas. It brought back memories from when we were dating.
2,No relation to the original work,"Having been very familiar with Jacobs' work in humorous ""interviews"" with fictitious celebrities, I was very excited about this CD. It turned out to be things that never were initially worthy of release: odd sound effects and early fascination with synthisizers and a few (very few) of the things originally released on the ""Wide Weird World"" album of the past. Mark Myers' mention of this on JazzWax alongside the original implied a connection (as does the title)....but there is very little of that here on this overpriced collection."
3,OK but....,A good book for the low price. It's large and has over 300 pages. It makes a good supplement for other spanish learning books that you may have. But I found it to be the type of book so often written by educators with many degrees. Too many rules.
1,Took too long to deliver,The product took way to long to ship. I ordered some things on the same day along with this product and they can immnediatly and this product was pushing the very last days in the allotted time given for shipping. I was disappointed in the fact that it took so long to ship and recieve this product.
4,Great practice exercises,"This book supplements the ""Speak in a Week"" set that I got nicely. ""Speak in a Week"" gets you speaking quickly, helps you learn structure and gives you an audio track to help with proper pronunciation, but it's a little weak on grammar.This book really fills in the gaps. Each section introduces a grammar concept, explains it clearly & then gives you several practice exercises to try it out. The answers for each exercise are in the back of the book, as well as a limited Spanish-English dictionary. The only downside to this book is that I haven't seen much to help you learn to pronounce the language correctly."
5,practice makes perfect books are the best,"i studied spanish independently for a bit and then started an immersion program while in costa rica. even while speaking on a daily basis, i found the practice makes perfect series to be the most helpful when it comes to application and practice excersices. never boring and tons of excersices to really drive the point home. buy it."
5,Oustanding value for the serious Spanish student,"If you are serious about learning Spanish and attaining fluency, you have to master verbs, and this book is a must buy. This book in simple terms explains the formation for all the verb tenses and moods, with the general rules and the exceptions. There are numerous examples and practice sentences and paragraphs. It may be helpful to repeat the written exercises once or more. Once you are truly familiar with all the material presented, you will not be confused about when to use the indicative, subjuntive, or imperative moods or how to form the various present, past, or future tenses in Spanish."
5,Great Series,This is a must have book for Spanish learning. It's a great go-to-book and has everything you need. If you are studying Spanish you should have this book in the house... as well as the other books in this series.
5,"You will learn your verbs, guaranteed","All reviewers praise this book, and so will I. It is really very good: clearly structured into chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of Spanish verb tenses. Very easy-to-understand explanations throughout the book (the explanation of when to use ""ser"" and when ""estar"" is priceless!), lots of exercises that will test your comprehension of the covered material. I bought the book about 7 weeks before an important Spanish test I had to take as part of my job application. Although I did not have time to go through the whole book, I was still able to review the most important parts of the Spanish verb structures; and it really made a difference! (I learned Spanish 10 years ago but never used it since then.) If you look for either a review material or for a book that will teach you the tricky Spanish tenses, buy this one. It's more than worth the money."
5,Excellent,"This book and PMP Pronouns & Prepositions are my most valuable Spanish texts. Explanations and drills for ALL tenses, very well organized."
4,Practice Makes Perfect Spanish Verb tenses,"In the short time that I have used the book, it has proven to be one of the better foreign language books that I have ever used. The exercises are very helpful and having the answers are a plus, so one does not get led astray."
5,Spanish Verb Tenses,Easy to use with worksheets that make the subject clear. I particularly like the written paragraph exercise. After writing the paragraph you can check your Spanish phrasing in the answer section.
5,hands down.....the best!,"This book really gave me confidence with my spanish. It's simple to follow and you will notice the improvement in your grammar almost immediately. It was even easy to follow when it got down to the subjunctive tense and we all know how daunting that can be. I've bought it for friends, and recommend it whenever I can. If you need help with grammar, this is the book for you. And look how cheap it is!!Too bad it doesn't come in Portuguese and Italian."
5,Spanish Verb Tenses Practice makes Perfect,"This is my second book by Dorothy Richmond. She covers the material clearly and gives practice both for the new material and in contrast with other material. You learn other vocabulary as well as you go along. I have been speaking Spanish for over 20 years at work, but I was self taught for the most part and so I have holes in my knowledge. I have learned much to fill said holes from this workbook and from Spanish Pronouns and Prepositions, which I originally purchased."
5,BEST way to practice Spanish conjugations & build vocabulary,"I searched all over for a good workbook to improve my beginning Spanish skills, and most books are very scattered and don't have intensive and cleary defined excercises. This book is a work horse and gets the job done. Not only does it provide lots of practice with conjugating verbs,(which I found the biggest challenge in learning the language), but it also, builds vocabulary and grammar. MY favorite part was translating the english paragraphs into spanish, such good practice. I, only, wish that they had it in other languages. This book is an invaluable tool for those who already have the basics spanish skills but need practice with verbs and vocabulary. See also, Practice Makes Perfect, pronouns and prepositions."
4,Still stacks up today as a highlight of the 'good' APC era,"Everything that has been said about this single still applies, it is terrific and really shows the talent and effort they put in at the start of APC. Too bad it went downhill with thirteenth step and plummeted with amotion.Hopefully they can get back to that one day, until then buy this single and enjoy what you missed if you only just got into them."
4,"Not the classic Hot Club, but pretty damn close","Always infectiously swinging, these Django recordings in a multitude of settings shows his ability to hang with the Americans all the way. Aching ballad intensity and hot solos abound."
5,You guys are the best!!!!!,"Your work is soo passionate!!! I'm so glad I found your music, now I'm addicted to it. Please keep up the good work and never stop singing, I just hope you can come up with an album in english, it will be a BOMB!!! I'm sure they'll love you like I do...beijos,Samantha"
3,Couple of issues,"Although I like this home theater amp, it does have a couple of issues:1. This amp will not change formats on HDMI from 1080i to 1080p. This limits using the amp to switch your HDMI inputs (a feature that I really wanted). My Dish DVR fails to reset the resolution to the TV from 1080i to 1080p when switched by the JVC amp. Does not seem to be a way to correct this.2. This amp runs very HOT and although it has a cooling fan, the high temperatures cause the fan to run continuously which is annoying because of the noise. Additionally, the fan has began to run ever louder as it ages."
3,Good but not great,"I had this receiver for about 8 months. The good points are that it had HDMI in and out, though only passthrough, and it sounded okay. The bad points were that it ran a little hot, and the interface with the remote or the faceplate of the receiver were awkward and annoying. Also, the manual was edited and organized by an 8th grader, it's very hard to follow.I think for the money you can do better with an Onkyo, but if you got a really great deal on this, it would do the job."
5,Awesome game!! ^_^,"Another really awesome game!!! I love how the whole thing works and just everything about it. The guide has its idiosyncrasies. ^_^;;; However, its great to have around! I know I would be lost without it. ^_^"
3,The Champ Jacket,The jacket was decent but it is made way to short for taller people. I am not that tall and the jacket barely goes past my waist. Tall people watch out!!!
3,DOES NOT ADD UP TO COMMERCIAL,My daughter is a HUGE pony fan She loves them. I thought I would suprose her by buying this pony however It does not act anythig like it appears on TV it does not get up but barely sits up. I love the fact it openes it eyes buy it does not say very much my daughter got bored of it quickly it said the same things over and over.She played with this little guy for about 3 hours tops within the 3 weeks she has owned it and finds her ponys who do not move to be more interesting than good morning pony.
2,Looks better on the TV commercial,"My 6 year old daughter absolutely flipped when she saw the commercial for this on TV. Of course, her marshmallow dad had to buy it for her right away. After less than an hour playing with it, she quickly realized that it wasn't quite as neat as the commercial had advertised.You should think twice about this one. It really is a one-trick pony, so to speak, that's way overpriced."
3,My Little Cheaply Made Pony Toy.,"Got the first one for my cousin Hanna for a birthday gift. After 2 months play the legs stopped working and grinding happened.I went right to hasbro and gave them an email saying our goodmorning sunshine was broken. And they mailed us postage to return it without the box and accessories.It took a couple months for them to mail us a new one. We even called Hasbro to ask and we got a nice lady to tell us what was going on. Something about new stock being made or something. And she would give Hanna a gift for waiting so long as she would always asked when we stopped to get the mail if her pony was back from the hospital.So we got her and a playset. The new one still works, but its not played with as much as I think my cousin is afraid of breaking her.So really, what's the point? To have a broken toy because it is loved or to have a kid soo afraid she's going to break it and it sitting on the shelf?"
2,Lovable pony but VERY POOR quality!!!,"Reading many of the reviews, I was sort of happy to see that the problems we have encountered with this pony were shared by others!! It worked for about 2 months, then this loud, grinding sound started and the pony wouldn't do anything except say ""Good morning Mommy!"". We actually have to hit it hard to stop the grinding! Very poor quality! It is sad because my 4 year old daughter really loves her pony and wouldn't go anywhere without it!!!"
4,Bought it with her own money and loves it,This is my daughters review of Good Morning Sunshine after she bought it with her own money about 6 weeks ago...Not a problem with my toy b/c once she was out of the box I got to see how she moved and the sounds she makes w/ bottle and pacifier. I like her a lot and have not had a problem ( I warned her of the reviews on amazon).My daughter is very pleased with this and I almost wanted her to save her money after the reviews but very happy that I let her.
1,didn't work 5 minutes,"My daughter got this pony for Christmas and luckily she didn't remove it from the box until the day after. It didn't even work for 5 minutes once we got it out of the box and she was heartbroken. We tried replacing the batteries but that didn't do it. I hopped right in the car and took it back to the store and exchanged for another. Amazingly the new one is still working. If I had it to do all over again, I would spend the money on something better and not this toy my daughter is worried will stop working if she plays with it."
2,Not a Durable Toy,"My 2 1/2 yr-old daughter got this for Christmas and was in love with it immediately. However, after a few days of play, it quit working. I had a friend who also bought one for her daughter and she mentioned that they had trouble with the battery contacts, so we checked that but it still wouldn't work. We returned it and got a new one that worked. After about a week, the new one also broke. It sounds like it has a short in it and gets stuck on one phrase. The legs don't work properly, either. Sadly, my daughter still hopes it will ""get better"" and still has it in her bed. Wish it was a better quality toy...would have been great."
1,Waste of money...,"I can't believe how duped I feel!!! This looked really cute on the box, and like it would be great fun for my baby and pony loving 3 year old. She doesn't even play with this thing because it says the same 2-3 phrases over and over, and you have to get the bottle just right with a lot of pressure to get it to work! It sounds like a robot in need of a new motor when it moves, and the legs pop out of joint too easy, so the thing doesn't even stand up sometimes. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If she likes ponies, get her the little ones and a doll, because the doll at least is not as awkward for her to hold."
3,My Little Pony,"My 4 yr old had to have this toy after seeing the commercial.It is very cute!I was a little disappointed that it doesn't have more to say. I can see this toy getting old pretty quickly. In the few days of owning this toy she has played with it for a total of 10 minutes at the most!!! Dora's talking van has been played with MUCH more (purchased within one day of each other).I think it is not worth buying, as there are much more interesting toys for $25.00, but try and tell that to a little one!"
2,Can't give her up!,"My 4 year old daughter loves her little pony, however, it stopped working. The head makes a grinding noise when it tries to move. It sleeps all of the time and we can't wake it up. My daughter loves it so much that she says ""It's OK I will just keep it the way it is"" I have tried to explain that Santa would not want her to have a broken toy and he will fix it and send it back. I have tried to order another to replace the broken and I will trade it... they are all out!"
1,Only worked for a couple hours then died ...,Same story here as the previous two posts. My daughter opened this Christmas morning and happily played with it on and off for a couple hours. Then it stopped working. Figured it was just old batteries so I popped in a few fresh out of the blister pack but no deal: this barely-played-with My Little Pony toy is dead. Can't believe Hasbro would sell something that would break so quickly after barely being used.
4,Works great...with a little work.,"The product worked ok, when first tested, but like others said, the volume was low. I solved that by removing the foam covers from the speakers, then removing the extra padding over the speakers and re-installing the foam covers. Volume is great now. Can here just fine when traveling 60 mph on my snowmobile."
4,Fast and good price.,"Service from this vender was fast, and sent me just what I wanted. I didn't give this all 5 stars, because one of the sets shorted out within a couple of weeks. I know they are sensitive, as I have to replace them almost yearly, which is not the venders fault. Otherwise when they are working they work great for Joanne's and my motorcycle trips."
3,Helmet Headset,This works fine for its intended use but the wires connecting the microphone to the ear speakers are much too long and need to be curled up somewhere inside the helmet which is not an easy thing to do.
1,Should have listened to the reviews.....,"I purchased two of these headsets for riding ATV's. Like others have stated here, the speakers are very quiet and can barely be heard even with the ATV shut off. The strange thing is the speakers are very loud when listening to the NOAA weather alerts on my Midland radios. So it seems to be an issue with the transmitting volume of the Midland radios. They are unusable for me, so I am returning them for a refund."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought 4 of these headsets and 4 midland GXT1000 radios so that my friends and I could talk while riding. We all ride 600cc sport bikes with closed face helmets.-The ptt button is very bulky and hard to find a place for on a sport bike handlebar.-When you mount the PTT button on the handlebar the cord nearly touches the ground!-The audio is far to quiet to hear when riding anything over 30mph (even on a stock 600rr)-There are just too many cords... 3 cords to the helmet for the speakers and mic, a super long cord for the ptt.I sent all of these back for a refund. They may work for some riders/bikes but are definetely not the solution for sport bikes! I recently bought a couple of midlands AVPH8 headsets with throat mics and am hoping that those will work much better."
1,HORRIBLE,I ordered a set of the headsets and they didn't work. I exchanged them for another set and they worked but you could hardly hear the person even with the volume turned all the way up. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT! Thankfully Amazon is a great company and I will be returning them for a refund.
1,Midland AVPH2 closed face helmet headset,Headset did not work at all right out of the package. Did not transmit sound or receive sound. Other headsets wrked fine on the same radio so I knew it was my headset. Get what you pay for and this headset is cheap junk. At least AMAZON has a easy return policy.
3,Race Headset,"We race on the weekends and a friend recommended the Midland radios and they work great. We bought closed face headsets with push to talk to mount on the steering wheel and we felt like pro drivers it worked so well. The only minor issue was the volume was a little too low even when turned to the max, but I couldn't tell if that was a radio or headset issue, so I can't give them a five."
1,Too Quiet,"I purchased two of these headsets for a motorcycle trip. The installation was relatively easy and generally I liked the setup. The ear pieces did cause my helmet (HJC CL-SP) to press against my ears but I think my helmet might actually have been the problem.All that became irrelevant though when we discovered that it was difficult to hear each other at 40 mph and impossible by 60. The problem was not wind noise or poor sound quality, it was (like some other reviews have pointed out) that the volume simply did not go loud enough. It even sounded too quiet when we were sitting right next to each other with our bikes idling. Since we spent most of our time at 70 mph the radios were almost useless to us.I noticed that many of the positive reviews mentioned using them with ATVs. Perhaps for low speed use these would be acceptable, but if you are looking for something to use on the highway, keep looking."
3,Great when it works.,"I bought this item for use while riding my ATV. It fit easily into the helmet and the sound quality was great. After a few weeks of use, however, it would lock the radio up in transmit mode and couldn't be released. I had purchased a second kit for another helmet, so I tried that one. It did the same thing as the first one. Midland customer service said they would replace them both. I hope the replacements last longer. It is possible that unplugging them with the radio ""on"" may have contributed to their failure. I will try turning the radio ""off"" prior to disconnecting in the future. There were no warnings in the limited instructions that came with the headsets to indicate this could be a problem. At least their customer service is good."
1,Do not use with newer Midland Radios,"I purchased the midland radios to replace my older midlands that I use with this helmet headset (Midland AVPH2 Closed Face Helmet Headset). The volume is extremely low when a headset is attached and I have to stop my motorcycle to hear. I compared the old and new radio and the volume is approximately 30% lower. I contacted Midland technical support they said that the volume was intentionally set lower on the newer radios when a headset is attached. So, Don't buy any new Midland radios if you intend to use with a helmet headset."
2,If you believe life will present all the opportunities,"If you believe in taking things as they come, that opportunities will present themselves, then this book may provide inspiration. If you have looked for opportunities and still haven't found the right work, this book will be a major disappointment as no insights are offered for this scenario. Yes, sometimes life does provide one with opportunities, but more often on needs to dig up those opportunities on one's own. This book will not guide you down this path."
1,Yawn...yawn...y...a...w...n,"Not enough practical, how-to advice and too many stories, most of which aren't particularly well told and many of which are about Mark, his friends and his family. What's worse, every few paragraphs, the stories are interrupted by callout quotes that break the flow."
4,At this juncture in my life..,"It is refreshing to read a book like this, when so much of what I hear is cacophony about the bottom line. Yes, it is the bottom line, but also about You and your relationship to your work.This book makes me think about my career decisions in light of how I am going to feel and how it will affect my relationships. It's not anything you have not heard before, that we have one life, that we ought to live fully and be honest with ourselves...It's also about keeping yourself in mind before the money, and if the money comes, don't feel bad either!Thanks Mark Albion, for sharing your stories!"
5,"Thoughtful, Powerful and Well Written","Mark Albion weaves engaging stories of some his heroes and heroines with his personal journey to wholeness and satisfaction in life. I couldn't put it down and, in fact, ordered 30 copies for my key executives, family and close friends..... so now I have a great collection of enthusiastic ""thank you"" cards and e mails!Also, just his selection of inspiring quotes scattered strategically through the book would be worth the price."
2,Not enough....,"I was a subscriber on Albion's e-mail list some years ago. I bought this book expecting more depth than what the list had. I was looking for a book that would really show how people make hard choices and focus their lives in alternative paths.I was disappointed and actually could not even finish the book.It lacked depth. Albion could have probed its subjects, could have tried to question them. Instead, he chose to almost worships them.Life is full of difficult choices. I personally have looked for books that open my eyes to new ways of looking at things, for in that I may find ""my truth"". This book tries to sell us ""one truth"" almost as a one-size-fits-all solution. I don't buy that.For a book of this type, with life-stories examples, I suggest Po Bronson's ""What should I do with my life"". I think is more authentic and more dettached in its analyses."
5,Reclaim your life.,"Socrates taught that ""The unexamined life is not worth living."" Mark Albion's fabulous book, Making a Life, Making a Living, brings to heart the message that the unlived life may not be worth examining. This book is an inspirational and instructive tool that inspires the reader to create a life according to the reader's values and dreams. This book empowers the reader to both ""do good"" and ""do well"" -- to make a difference in the world and earn a living at the same time. If you want to have a more balanced life consistent with your inner voice, you have to read this book."""
1,Neither relevant nor useful,"I read this book under the misimpression that it would help in my current search for my life's work. While a few of the stories were inspirational, ultimately the book was a set of bios of cronies of Albion's, with little use to those of use who are not in a position to attend Harvard or be born into wealthy families, as most of the subjects were. In addition to the lack of credible stories, the tone was often diadctic and condescending. I found the book useless and self-indulgent."
2,Inspiring stories but little guidance,"Quite disappointing; while a few of the biographical anecdotes are inspiring, the author offers little guidance or ""how to."" Additionally, the narrative thread is constantly being broken with quotations. After a few pages, I found this practice very annoying. I think the author had a good magazine article or motivational speech here but tried to turn it into a ""bestseller"" instead."
2,Needed balance,"May be of inspiration for those interested in humanitarian or non-profit work. Although I'm not religious, I became annoyed that the majority of people profiled were from a certain religious/ethnic or economic group."
1,Making money on people's life stories & collection of quotes,"Mark Albion is a great speaker. I heard him live. Being in a business school, his book was high on students' list. But I regret buying it. So what's the big deal in writing and editing other people's life stories. The chapters in the book are based on few people's stories, where author wrote their life's turing point events step by step. Author did not even do in depth anaylsis of these stories. Additionally, each page is full with quotes from different people/books, some being absolutely irrelevant to the topic."
3,Making a Life or Making a Fortune?,"The quotes in this book are good. Some of the stories are interesting. But as much as I wanted to really like this book because it was recommended to me by people I admire, I couldn't make it to the end. The moral and tone of the book seemed to be that the ultimate purpose is making lots of money. The examples of people giving up six-digit salary careers and fancy lifestyles for a higher purpose eventually wound their way back to those same people earning heaps in a different business. Maybe I didn't read far enough, but I didn't see any stories of people who gave up the high life, worked for a cause they loved, never made another dime and were still happy."
5,"Making a Life, Making a Living: Reclaiming Your Passion","I found this book spoke to what had been in my heart for the past 10 years...Mainly, what am I doing and what do I REALLY want to do? It validated the odessy I had just taken on, which was not to consider yet one more job until I really got back to who I am and how I am going to do what I love and therefore make a meaningful contribution. This author has done that, quite successfully and found others who did the same thing. It is one of the most inspiring books I have read in a long time! I have recommended it to at least a dozen of my baby boomer friends who know they've gotten off the track and are determined to make a better life by finding their passion and pursuing it. Thanks Mark Albion!"
5,Pure Entertainment!,"There is nothing more entertaining that seeing and hearing Guy Van Duser in person, however, if this is not possible, this CD is the next best thing to actually being there. It was performed at Boulevard Music, a frequent stop for many of the top guitarist of our time. Not only is Guy Van Duser a genious on the guitar, but his musical knowlege will also astound you. He explains to his audience the background of each song he plays in an interesting and often humorous way. I totally recommend this CD for your collection."
2,"Boring, long, and I skipped about half of it","Although I admit I wasn't expecting much when I bought this book, I was very disappointed. I rather enjoyed Mr. Darcy's Daughters, but this sequel, which involes Mr. Darcy's (Of Pride and Prejudice fame) daughter, Alethea, was not only boring but at times so silly the reader is almost reduced to laughter.Alethea leaves he abusive husband under the guise os a young man with ony her maid, Figgins, with her. They meet a dashing English gentleman who immediately recognizes Alethea and keeps an eye on her as she runs around the European continent in search of her elder sister Camillia, who was the heroine of the last book.Alethea is not only an unlikable heroine, but she is silly, and the reader loses interest in her quickly. The book was salvagable only for its lush description of Italian countryside."
4,Good stand alone novel,"Elizabeth Aston's first novel, Mr. Darcy's Daughters was a little disappointing, being an inferior copy of Pride and Predjudice. However, I really enjoyed this new novel. Aston breaks off from trying to copy Jane Austen and explores themes that are more mature and relevant today with Althea's abusive husband. This is NOT another Jane Austen copy, which may be disappointing if that's what you are looking for, but I think it's much better."
1,This book is boring and lifeless,The book is boring! The characters are boring. I'm one half way through it and ready to toss it out! The characters have no personality and with the exception of the main character and her servant (so far) each one is immoral in one way or another . . . . also the dialogue is seriously lacking. It's a thumbs down.
2,Ok but could be better,"This is written similar to the other three novels by this author but read it last because it just isn't ""as good"". Feel free to skip unless you really want to read all Jane Austin type books, which is me."
2,This is kinda awful,"While this recording has some wonderfully talented people included it's just a mess. I love Jennifer Hudson but her rendition of ""Easy to Be Hard"" is painful to listen to at points because she's over singing. Over singing seems to be a theme because several songs are just shrill and could have done with the singers toning it down a bit. Norm Lewis is great starting off ""The Flesh Failures/Let the Sunshine In"" and the second guy is really strong but around the time the song breaks into the chorus of let the sun shine in things get lost and the ending is a total mess. The high point is probably Adam Pascal's performance on ""I Got Life"" with Raúl Esparza's ""Hair"" coming in a close second. I'd suggest saving some money and buying another recording and downloading a few individual songs from this album if you just want to hear them for fun."
5,Unreal!!!,"A fabulous cast including the incredible talents of Lillias White, Jennifer Hudson, Ana Gasteyer, Soshana Bean and Eden Espinosa! The journey this CD takes you on is truly a treat! The new songs on the disc are FANTASTIC! (Eden and Ana) The men in the cast are just as wonderful as the ladies...a VERY diverse cast with a FANTASTIC sound!"
5,Hair - Actors' Fund of America Benefit,I have loved HAIR since it came out way back when and I have numerous copies of the recording. I love this one and would recommend it highly.
3,SHRILL!!!,"Most of the songs are great, but there are far too many singers who ""oversouled"" the songs. One of my favorite songs ""Easy to be Hard"" sounds like an American Idol or Apollo finalist trying way too hard."
2,This recording is very disappointing.....,"After reading the below reviews, I decided to purchase this CD. I am a huge fan of the play, movie, and their respective recordings- BUT, this CD is terrible. The songs are very oversung- some of them even sound like they have a choir in the background! There is no continuity to the singers, and wonderful classic songs like ""Where do I go"" are sung by the opposite gender?!? I have never written one of these reviews before, but I hope you consider carefully before purchasing this CD."
1,MamaStealth Strikes Again,oh... once again the Viennese Disaster attempts to woo the children with half-assed retreads conjured up by engineers in far-flung lands who go un-credited (or from Connecticut) and thinks resurrecting old Sound Factory tracks no one will notice -- NOTTRY AGAIN!!! ROXY morons might shell out the money (or download it) but you ain't foolin' the true folkand by the way -- WHO YOU FOOLIN? THIS WASN'T RECORDED LIVE ANYMORE THAN MY MOTHER SINGING IN THE SHOWER
1,i shoulda spent the money on asprin,this cd gives me a headache. if this is what i was to expect im glad he didnt show up for that party in LA last year.
3,Let down,"My long-time partying friend said this was really good, so I bought it. What could go wrong with both Rauhofer and Roxy on the jacket? Unfortunately, as someone else said, it sounds very mid-`90s. I was expecting dark and hard, but instead I got dark and thin. This may have been groovy 6 years ago, but now it's just toss-away filler. Needs more energy -- more meat. I usually love his mixes, and I've heard P.R. live (and was marginally satisfied), but this CD compilation won't have me buying anything else with his name on it unless I listen to the full thing first. Disappointing."
4,Short but sweet.,"I love fairy-tales! The story of Little-Red-Riding hood is a very interesting one. Lon Po Po is a Chinese version with beautiful illustrations, which is the main reason I bought it. I am an aspiring children's book writer and illustrator expanding my collection and knowledge through buying books from amazon. I am a little disappointed by how short the story is, making the book rather thin. I wish I would have found the hard cover version. I would suggest this book to fairy-tale connoisseurs, art enthusiasts, and parents alike. I would recommend getting the hard cover version if possible, especially for children."
4,I don't know how traditional this is,"I mean, I know it's a version of Red Riding Hood, but I don't know if it's traditional to China as well.This version differs from the European version in that the children are home alone when the wolf comes, and in that they save themselves instead of waiting for a woodcutter (or even getting eaten entirely!)The illustrations are certainly a bit scary. More sensitive children may wish to avoid this book."
4,Lon Po Po,Title- Lon Po Po A Red-Riding Hood Story From ChinaAuthor- Ed YoungDo you recommend this book? Yes because it is great.The book was so good. It's about a wolf and 3 girls. The 3 girls were very scared because of the wolf so they had to figure out how to get rid of the wolf. So they decided to climb up a tree and get a rope with a basket and hang it down and the wolf got on it then they put the rope over on the other side and let go of it and the wolf fell and hit his head the wolf tried this a couple more times until the last time when he broke his heart so he went away forever.
4,The big bad wolf strikes again,"This translation and retelling of ""A Red-Riding Hood Story from China"" is very nicely done, having been a recipient of a 1990 Caldecott Medal. The author does preface the book with a dedication which is worth mentioning: ""To all the wolves of the world for lending their good name as a tangible symbol for our darkness."" While the trickster is eventually duped by his three young ""victims,"" I think that the story expresses a poignant death for the wolf: ""Not only did the wolf bump his head, but he broke his heart to pieces."" On the whole, I found the story to be beautiful and yet melancholy. From my Dakota (Sioux) culture, where wolves are not viewed as the personfication of evil or darkness, I can only wonder if others feel any sympathy for the wolf."
1,Feel Bad for Dissing a Classic,"As an adult, I liked the story - but don't think it's appropriate for a child. I think most children would conclude that wolves are evil and scary (the illustrations of the wolf are certainly scary). Since I live a stone's throw from wolf country, this book is probably not the best bedtime reading for my child. Sent it back."
5,A must!!!,"This single really is a must for NRG lovers and 80's lovers!!The single is one piece of dynamite!!!The single version is fine, but the real treat is the club 2000 mix, wich is a masterpiece, it's one of those remixes wich you can play over and over again without getting bored!!!The third track "" Fight the feeling"" is Ok, but it's a remix and I've heard the original wich is much much better!!!!(...)this single is a snap because it's almost impossible to find in the shopsDonn"
3,Convienient but flimsy,its nice to have the looped feature. the guage of the pin is cheap and flimsy allowing for clips to fall off with vibration.
5,Seem a little small,"I like them, but I think that maybe they sent me the 1/16th scale clips. Other than that, they are soo much easier to put on and take off then the normal clips."
5,Beautiful and Imaginative,A beautiful and imaginative book that tracks the life of a child through the centuries. Well illustrated and informative vignettes describe various aspects of everyday life. Bought two copies so I could keep one for myself!
3,Another Mediocre Effort,"No direction or style. Just another blowing effort by Redman. Nothing comes close to his first two CDs, though this is an improvement over his last CD. He has the capability to put together something more stylish and memorable."
2,It's difficult to believe the ratings on this CD,"If this CD is ""smooth"" and full of ""grace and beauty"", then I have to assume that I wasn't listening to the same Joshua Redman CD that the other reviewers were listening to....I have a large jazz collection and for some reason I hadn't listened much to Mr. Redman. Now I know why.....Many of the cuts on this CD are quite the opposite of ""smooth"", and in fact are harsh and cold ! In fact this is one of the few CD's I've bought in the last ten years that I would like to return.....My inclination after listening to the entire CD several times is that Joshua Redman is vastly over-rated...there are so many great jazz musicians who are more talented than he is, but then maybe he and his fans make up for it by being pretentious..."
4,The beginning of a new era,"A previous reviewer from San Fran wrote... ""Many of the cuts on this CD are quite the opposite of ""smooth"", and in fact are harsh and cold ! In fact this is one of the few CD's I've bought in the last ten years that I would like to return.....""If this person wants smooth jazz he should buy Kenny G (and I don't mean Kenny Garrett). Joshua Redman is the best saxman of his generation and this first album of original compositions is a an important step towards claiming his legacy. It is not great like Giant Steps or Kind of Blue but it is great as jazz recordings of the past five years go and more importantly it marks the true beginning of Redman's ascent. One day, when Redman has composed and recorded his Kind of Blue, we will be able to look back at this recording and realize that some of us knew it was just a matter of time."
5,Your Gonna Love It!,"Beg, borrow, steal pennies from small children if you need to to buy this one: two tracks into my first listen and I knew it was a keeper. A few highlights: the (all too brief) counterpoint between Redman and pianist Aaron Goldberg in Belonging will remind you of the now distant compositional love affair between Brubeck and Paul Desmond; beautiful progressions in Neverend recall Redman's collaboration with McCoy Tyner in Prelude and Sonata; how to describe the ballad, Balance, except that I'm wearing out the repeat button on my remote and the laser light in my CD replaying it."
5,Delicious and beyond.,"I cannot imagine a more graceful blending of two often contradictory trends, a spirit of improvisation that remains unabashed in its delight for the beautiful. I think Trane would be pleased to see his spiit so reverently sustained. Almost every cut evolves into something greater than the sum of its parts. This has a nicely balanced supporting cast, and I will continue to look for big things for pianist Aaron Goldberg. In short, both tasteful and tasty. This would be a great disc to use to introduce improvisational, free jazz to a neophyte, working backwards towards his spiritual and aesthetic forebears."
3,Inches matter,Ohhh the humanity!!! 6 inch chef knife??? This would be the best set of knives if only the chefs knife was a worthy edition. There is no sense to buy 15 different knives. I'm surprised some of these knife sets don't come with throwing stars. This set has every knife you will ever need for any recipe unless you plan on actually killing your dinner first or you have a Michelin Star. If your asking yourself what's a Michelin star... nevermind. If you can get past a 6 inch chefs knife it's perfect.
4,Nice set - love the scissors,I have had 1 set of these for about 5 years. They have been very good and I love the scissors. The handles quickly snap apart for easy washing. I like how the set comes with the basics and they leave a few slots open for adding any others you may want. I find this is the perfect amount and the block size is not super huge on my counter. I purchased another set this winter to take to a vacation home I own. Nice set that lasts.
4,very sharp,"This set was perfect for my wife. We already had a very nice very expensive 8"" chef's knife so we did'nt need another one. There is a problem with the small paring knife, for some reason it shows some slight rust spots after the first wash in the diswasher. the other knives are still in great shape after being put through the same dishwasher. This leads me to believe that this knife might be less quality steel. Other than that the whole set works great and keeps a very fine edge, including the paring knife."
5,great set,"great set the delivery was smoother then expected, they were actually deliverd before their eta."
4,Good Book,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was hooked from the first page. I think it took a lot of guts to write about some of the things Natalie experienced while growing up and during her career. She was brutally honest & candid about her drug use and I'm glad that she's been able to stay clean. The book was very riveting and yet humorous at times. I can only hope that Natalie can someday mend the rift between her and her Mom.I graduated the same year that ""This Will Be"" became a hit. That's the Natalie Cole that I remember. I wasn't aware of her father's legacy nor the big shoes that she had to fill. I too saw the movie but it doesn't do the book justice!After reading this book it makes you want to listen to all of her CD's. Thank you Natalie for never giving up. It gives the rest of us hope that we too can overcome anything with God's help."
5,5 Stars!!!!!!!,"The Life of Natalie Cole is a story of life, hope, and forgiveness. This powerful story proves true with Christ, All Things Are Possible. Thank You Jesus for allowing Natalie Cole to live through it all.... God has much more for her to do. 5 Stars all the WAY!!!"
4,good but a little different from what I expected,"The book is ok, but I had not paid attention that it was about bad language words history in Britain. And I speak, research and teach American English..."
4,Good Halter,"I've used this type of halter in the past and it works well if your dog is no heavier than 50 lbs. Once my new dog past the 50lb mark, we had to move to a nose lead."
3,Looks neat and sturdy but still pulls,Must not work for any dog i have 2 German Shepard and Australian Cattle Herder they both still pull for first half of walk then calm down(which they did before)but well made and sturdy and makes them look like they have suspenders on!
1,Not sturdy enough.,"This was the second one I bought. The first one was too small for my 60 pound Golden, I did follow the size chart when I purchased it. The second one fit but he chewed the nylon halter off in less than five minutes. Then, he snapped the plastic fastener while on a lead."
2,Didn't work for 75 pound boxer.,"Adopted a 2 year old male boxer that needed some leash training. Couldn't adjust the openings to the appropriate size - was either too tight or would be too big. Maybe it was all user error, but this didn't keep him from pulling on the leash."
3,Not Bad item for mid to smaller dogs,"Not the worse our dog is pretty strong,just seems a lil lightly made for larger dogs,but does work.would be better if stronger"
2,Broke first time used,"My dog was somehow able to reach the slide latch on his shoulders, in the process he chewed it and the harness is useless now. It seemed like quality merchandise, but was super easy to destroy. I was disappointed because I really liked the product."
5,A LOT better than being dragged...,My 67 lb. Bouvier is a strong as an ox.I was having serious shoulder issues from her pulling.This harness cut her pulling about 50%.I can now walk her without being stressed out.Good product.
2,Not the same Sporn Halter it used to be,"I had a Sporn halter for several years that I used on my 50lb mixed breed dog who is an 'enthusiastic' walker and it worked GREAT in slowing her down. Then one of the extensions broke off and I ordered another one. It was flimsier and the sizing was different than the original. So I ordered a different size and it too was flimsy and now way too big (the 1st was too small) and my dog weighed the same. So I don't know what happened to the quality of the product, but whatever happened took a great product to one I don't ever use. I was hugely disappointed."
2,Didn't stop him from pulling,"I have a 70lb. mixed breed dog that loves to pull on the leash. When I first put this harness on him it seemed to be working. The pulling wasn't as bad. However, as soon as he got used to the feeling of having it on, his pulling was as bad as ever. Also, it is a pain to put off and on, the straps are so thin that if I tried to leave it on him he could chew through them in no time. A friend of mine has the same harness and said it works pretty well on her dog; maybe it just depends on the dog, but it wasn't successful with mine."
3,"This thing was Magic...at least for a week or so. May work on ""normal dogs.""","Somehow when I put this thing on my dog he magically forgets he is a little a$$hole and actually behaves himself on a walk.Hold everything! Urgent update!The magic wore off. Apparently he just got used to the uncomfortable feeling and decided to suck it up go back to pulling again.Maybe it will work with your dog but mine is a hyper,head strong,ball of fire and he is proving hard to break."
2,Get any other bowl but this!,"I love this brand of soups, and will give every flavor four stars.... except this one. no matter how much i tinkered with the measurements while preparing it, i couldn't get it to not taste awful. the udon and miso bowls are my favorites, but i will never order this flavor again."
2,Just Okay,"I like the idea that it's more healthy than other soups on the market, but people are not going to continue to buy this if Annie Chun doesn't improve on the taste. I would eat it, but my kids think it has a blah taste."
2,Good attempt for udon but there's definitely room for improvement!,The noodles are cracked and brittle when you mix in the hot water. Taste was fine but I couldn't get over the inconsistent texture of the noodles.
5,Great for work,try having this shipped to your work address and then you have a quick lunch ready to have on days when you are busy or forget to bring lunch in or can't get out. More people should try this
4,story is beginning to move again,"I consider the second book as a filler between 1 and 3. This is where the story gets picked up. One of the central character is introduced, and the real conflict begins."
4,Cute heels.,"I bought these heels for a wedding I was going to. Not sure if these are really wedding shoes, but whatever. I love wearing flats and it's really hard for me to walk in heels but these were actually not that bad, I managed to walk around in these on different occasions and not twist my ankle or look really awkward. These are super cute and basic so they work for a multitude of occasions."
4,An elegantly sexy shoe,"I love the shoes, they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like. They're a beautiful color, something you don't always see, and quite eye-catching. And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago.As a ""Nine West"" Fantatic, thank you Amazon for having them available!"
4,great sounds,I think that this is a great dance CD that really gets your blood pumping and gets you ready for a weekend of wild partying. I would definitely but a CD like this one again. A wee Belter of a dance CD with music to stir your soul. Yeah Baby!
5,AMAZING BOOK,This Book is amazing. I love the way he writes and explain things with real life examples..he is wonderful. I never wrote a review for a book but this one deserve it. Is rare to find a book were you can identify yourself with and the best part is that once you start reading you cant stop because you wanna know more and more of what he have to say.
1,Laughably bad,"I'm thankful I didn't pay for this junk--I borrowed the book from a friend. Jeon's writing style leaves a lot to be desired-he often presents rambling, confusing ideas through antecdotes from his own life. Usually these stories involve him setting his friends straight with the wisdom he's acquired. This wisdom has come to him through the many relationships he keeps reminding us he's had. When I got to the part where he counsels a friend who just discovered his girlfriend's breasts are fake I had to throw the book down. The real fake is Jeon--who poses as a writer and spiritual leader but who's really just another hack."
4,problem with Lamentations CDs in the set,I don't know if that's an issue with the set I bought or with all of them. Both of the Lamentations CDs have a continuous buzzing throughout. It's like the humm you'd get from high voltage cables. Anywone with a box set have this problem?
5,A MUST,"Very great for any Opeth fan to own. A MUST! This covers the best music from the band as of late (minus Still Life which is phenomenal). I particularly like that they released ""Lamentations"" a live disc recorded in the UK in 2003....and that buzzing sound on the disc, although slightly annoying, is more than likely noise interference off of their amplifiers.Can't get much better music for the money! Buy it now!"
5,Great Box Set,"I bought this because I was dissatisfied with mp3 quality (even 320kbps bit rate) of these songs. I ripped them to lossless and they have served their purpose. Great price for some of the best albums ever made by the best band of all time (in my opinion) Great set if you are unfamiliar with the material or if you want to own the discs. Great buy. No regrets.^ Same review as The Candlelight Years Box Set.Also, no weird sounds on my Lamentations."
3,Beware the size,Runs very small. I wear an 8 and these I could barely get my foot into. You lose money on then return from amazon so order larger by at least 1/2 size.
3,Review,I like the look of the shoes on my feet. It's slightly tight in the front. Can get quite uncomfortable after wearing it for a long day.
1,Yuck!,"These are *not* the original version of these great songs. They're still the same songs, but they just aren't the studio versions I remember listening to -- they are sort of a ""light"" version of those songs. Have ordered the Ultimate Collection and hope it has the versions of these great songs I was looking for."
3,Not all songs are the 'official' studio-released versions,"I'm not a Michael Martin Murphey expert, but not all the songs on this ""Best of..."" release are what you hope to hear. For example, the song 'Wildfire' in this collection is NOT the one played on the airwaves decades ago. That particular version, with the wonderful, ethereal piano solo at the beginning and end is only on his album ""Blue Sky Night Thunder"". Too bad that Murphey's never written more songs like that one..."
4,Re-records....but GOOD!,"Yes, these are re-records, at least Wildfire, Carolina in the Pines and Geronimos Cadillac are.I think the rest are for the most part originals. I bought my copy of this CD 10 years ago. Unlesssomeone has tampered with the newer releases of this CD, it has the original piano intro and fades.It will be personal opinion whether you like this re-record. I for one like it because the sound ismuch richer and improved on both Wildfire and Carolina in the Pines. But each listener will have tobe the judge. I own both versions on different CDs and to me, they are all good."
3,Hmmm. Me thinks Amazon has made a mistake!,"I have heard this album, but I have not purchased it from Amazon. At least not that my wife and I can remember buying. However, if you like Michael Martin Murphey's more contemporary oriented music, this is a great CD. I however prefer his ""Cowboy Songs"" series of true western music far better."
5,Great Book!,"The book arrived promptly- the only issue is that the binding didn't last. I don't blame the seller, I believe this was a publisher boo boo."
1,A good insight to what some people are capable of for money!,"I was somehow forced to rate the book one star, because there is no possibility of rating it with none. However, and in second thoughts, this book *is* worth at least one star, because it will give you a mercyless insight to what some writers are capable of doing for the money."
5,Super !,J'ai acheter le CD de musique et il est vraiment nice ! J'suis vraiment content de l'avoir acheter ! :P
3,Fleshed-out ephemera,"3 1/2Tobin's exquisite video-game offering might feel melodically fragmented even compared to his normally choppy electronic flair, but detached from any button-pushing the disc still works surprisingly well and holds up to the detailed and dense production he is known for."
5,Addictive!,"Don't let Track 1 fool you, this is a full-on pop album crafted with the highest regard for 70s melody and accessibility. Track 2 introduces you to the sound that will carry the weight of the album. A incredibly listenable effort from start-to-finish, you'd never know this was the same ""Ooooooh, baby"" voice of Stardust's ""Music Sounds Better With You"". Top cuts are ""Let's Get High"", ""Lights In The Sky"", ""I Wish"", ""Give Me The Grace"", and ""These Emotions"". Lyrics are a decent effort -- considering the French origins -- but you will not stop singing along with all of these tracks. A huge improvement from the Diamond's first solo effort, ""Strange Attitude"". Search for this guy on MySpace, he occasionally will post free tracks from this CD."
4,Refreshing,"I borrowed this cd from a friend and couldn't get it out of my cd player. It's a mellow cd with great melodies, strong arrangements, and lyrics with substance that aren't too pretentious. Think John Mayer, Coldplay, Travis, and a bit of Everything But the Girl throw together in no particular order. It was surprising that no one has ever heard of him with the exception of a side project he did with Stardust on 'The music sounds better with you...'.It's rare for an album to come along that you can throw in and listen to all the way through, but this one passes the test for me that cd's like Joshua Tree, Parachutes, Room for Squares, and White Ladder have passed."
5,Absolutely yummy!,"Whether you are gluten-free or not, this is a yummy snack! The ingredients are quality and delivers the flavor to savor!"
4,2nd favorite,"While cranberry is 1st place for my taste buds, the Fruit and Nut is next in line! Love Bakery and Main products! Love there's not tons of sugar and that my not-so-much gluten free husband enjoys them too! Then you know you have something good going on!"
2,Not very good.,Bakery on Main does well with their Apple walnut granola as well as there cranberry granola. I would give both of those 4 stars (excluding the price frusterations) but the extreme fruit and nut isn't any good. Tastes gross to me. They need to totally change this recipe.
1,did not like,"There was so many great review on this granola, that i decided to buy it but i hate it. This is not granola, if you want granola buy bare naked it's the best. stephanie, brooklyn"
2,A little bitter - Not what I expected,I wanted to make a winter wedding cake that had a little sparkle to it. Although I admit that I I have never used edible glitter it wasn't quite what I expected. I thought it would be smaller like real glitter. This glitter is thin flakes kinda like fish food with not a lot of shine to it. It also gave the cake a little bit of a bitter taste. I wish now that we had just left the glitter off.
5,High Quality,"I enjoy cooking with my Wearever set. The non-stick coating on the frying pan works great, it stands up to everyday use, and it's easy to clean. It should be hand cleaned only cause the dishwasher tends to be a little rough on the steel and non-stick coating. I recommend this pan for anyone looking for a quality tool for home cooking."
4,Farscape: The Game,Farscape: The Game has to be one of the best looking games of this genre since Diablo. I really enjoyed playing this game and the character's are exactly like the show.
1,worst game ever played,"i bought this game thinking that as it is based on space and aliens, it must be a great entertainment. i was shocked to find that it was so under the grade and i think if there had been stars for negative marking then i would have given it 5 stars for the worst game. don't buy this game, it is so boring and so bad, u will be very upset that you have spent money on such a bad game like me."
5,Best Extended Dance album ever,"A complete 5-star remix album. Nothing beats the Pet Shop Boys of 1986, as they introduced themselves to the music world. If you know the normal versions of each of these tracks, you'll love these ones even more. One of my top 5 favorite albums."
3,"For a Remix EP, still not a bad job from the Boys!","I rate this album lower than some other PSB albums I own because of it's short length. The inclusion of remixes of two of their early B-sides, ""In The Night"" and ""Paninaro"" would later be included on the double collection ""Alternative"". They're still pretty good, and I also like the lengthy versions of ""Suburbia-The Full Horror"", ""Opportunites"", ""Love Comes Quickly"", and especially the Boys' classic ""West End Girls"". All in all, not really too bad, not as good as the ""Discography"" compilation, but still worlds better than the purely awful ""Disco 2"". But that's a story for another time..."
3,A nice extra,"This is really meant for the hardcore fans of the band. The mixes are average and only cover the earliest time period of the PSB. Dedicated fans will find that the best version of ""Suburbia"" is found here."
2,not up to their high standard,"you want great songs like Paninaro or in the night, get their Altenative album (those versions are shorter but otherwise pretty much the same). this remix of Love comes quickly is better than the original but, let's face it, it is not that great. Making West End Girls longer and changing its beat does not really make it considerably better. Anyway, this Cd is for huge fans only and even they should get it used. Instead of this nonsense, get other PSB Cds. my favorites: Introspective, Very, Bilingual, nightlife. if you are new to the PSB, get their greatest hits, discography."
4,Control,"This book is very interesting, found myself reading more than i planned to every time i picked up the book!! very good"
5,Bring on more Lane and Gray...,"I loved ""Control"". It was a real page-turner with sharply drawn characters and lots of plot surprises, and how delightful to have humans with problems who don't feel the need to endlessly whine about them. Bring on more cases for Lane and Gray to solve in their intelligent fashion, Ms. Tienne!"
2,"Oh, come on... let's be honest...","...He can't sing and his songs are kinda lame. Having a famous ne'er-do-well dad and a limitless capacity to try and shock the squares can really only go so far. I mean, if you really like this record, more power to you. But it really isn't very well made or all that engaging. Yes, he might not ""sound like everybody else,"" but that doesn't necessarily make him a good alternative to what's out there."
3,Nero Wolfe plays better at home than away,"The review below describes the characters and I will not repeat it. In this book Nero Wolfe leaves his brownstone and established routine and goes to Montana to assist Archie. I had read the Rex Stout series some thirty years ago when I was in a hospital in Staten Island and the medicos were trying to stick a lymphoma diagnosis on me. (They were wrong.)It is fun to go back and spend time with my former friends Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe. Objectively, this novel is not as good as some others. The Montana characters are not very well defined and the plot is not what I would call a pageturner. However, it is enjoyable to read how Archie adjusts to and copes with the tyrannical and ultra-opinionated Wolfe. Also you will want to eat a Montana trout deal."
2,Wolfe out on the range,"It was delightful to encounter NW out and about, wearing a poncho, sitting on a rock, cooling his beer in a stream. And it was interesting to witness NW and AG interacting, at least for a brief time, as equals instead of employer and employee. But the story itself was nonsense. I hate it when there is no way for the readers (or in this case, even the detectives) to figure out who the culprit is with the means at hand. If you're looking for another fun adventure with Archie and Mr. Wolfe, pick this book up. But if you want to read a conventional, challenging whodunit, pass it by."
4,A good easy read,"As a female director myself in the more kinky side of porn I really enjoyed and related to the women that wrote for this book. I loved that the articles are all around 10-15 pages each which is the perfect length to read in a single sitting at a coffee shop, over lunch, etc. Some of the women I know, some I know of and others from more behind the scenes had a really interesting perspective on what they do. Agood, easy, lighthearted read from women proud of what they do in pornography.My director name: Chanta Rose"
4,Not bad.,interesting perspective from some of them. But it's only interesting if you happen to like the actress in the book recounting the story.
5,Timberland Rocks,"I got these boots for my wife at Xmas and they immediately made her day. Smiling for DAYS! She had a pair back in high school and has longed for another one for years...happily they have not disappointed. Comfortable, rugged, good looking. Worth every penny."
5,Oh My God!,"We first saw this on the German TV - HEAT and we said ""Latino clubs better get a copy of this quick."""
4,Bailando is a hot dance song!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I heard this song was in a dance club in Mexico, I couldn't get the song out of my head the whole time I was on my trip. I was so mad becasue when I left I still didn't know who sang the song. I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon.com!! Its hot spanish song!!!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST SONG OF THE 1990'S,"I'VE PLAYED THIS SONG ABOUT 100 TIMES AND I STILL LOVE IT. THIS SONGS COMES IN EVERY ( MIX ) THAT I MAKE FOR MY GIRL FRIEND. PEOPLE JUST LOVE THIS SONGS EVERYTIME I PLAY IT. YOU KNOW? THIS SONGS REMINDS ME WHEN I MEET MY GIRL FRIEND . I RECCOMEND THIS ""CD"" TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HAVE FUN IN A PARTY BECAUSE THIS SONG IS THE ""BOMB"" ""UNA BOMBA AS WE SAY IN SPANISH."
3,Loona version is much much better,"Paradisio fell short in doing their rendition of Bailando. A female by the name of Loona did this song as well and it's much much better. Her vocals are stronger than Paradisio. If you would like to listen to the Loona version, search at Audionet for bailando.Amazon.com personnel, try to find this title for your website. It is available on urban recordsThanks"
3,Still worth a read,"Goldfish is an easier read than its companion, Jinx, but still fell short of ""groundbreaking"" to me. I liked the Goldfish character better in this story, being he was a lot more confident, yet weathered. But, the story seemed to drag on without making any real point. The dialogue, as with Jinx, frustrated me for the same reasons: ""reality"" conversations just don't work on paper. Bendis is definately a great writer, I will not dispute that, but, Goldfish did not continuously capture me throughout the entire tale. Since this is not a spoiler review I will not reveal any plot. But, I'll just say, the end is worth the wait."
5,A pleasant suprise,I must admit I was skeptical of this book when I started but it won me over. A very compelling and detailed look at Orthodox Missions and the theological structure needed for such endeavors. If you have converted to Orthodoxy you would do well in reading this book to flush out your ideas of what Orthodox missions entail verse what you have been exposed to in the west. Well written with just a few points that I personally had some issues with but felt no need to ding the rating over.
3,"Softer, Touchy Side of RED FLAG.....","I love Red Flag and have recently have gotten back in to them. This is the second album from them under thier own label and mind I say its amazing. The entire albums caries the music of ""Enigma"" along with voice that we have come to love from the Reynolds brothers. The lyrics are sad and all about LOVE. Every song compares love to the ocean and that is why its called ""the lighthouse"". Red Flag always amazes me with their style as they change with time but never they leave thier synth sounds for anything less."
2,"Sorry, I didn't like it","It's nice when your favorite artist makes a cd with a relaxing, down tempo music. Like PSB's behavior. This albums is certainly no behavior. Mark's beatiful voice is mixed down and most of the time you only hear the synth sounds. The songs are unmelodic and not at all innovative. Certainly too this album is no Enigma. These album felt very short from the album ""Behavior"" or from Enigma albums. Don't allow this album to make a wrong impression about Red Flag. Red Flag is a great group and if just heard Light Album and are dissapointed don't dismay, just buy the follow up cd Caveat Emptor album and I will assure you will be HAPPY very HAPPY again with Red Flag's sound."
2,More Plastic Junk,"If you already have a house full of plastic toys, you will probably love this. It's bright, it's big, it's quickly assembled and quickly broken. My kids got this as a gift, played with it for a couple of days, and then went back outside to the swingset, the bubbles, the sidewalk chalk, and other more active diversions."
5,Great Fun,"This was the first littlest pet shop toy for our household and its a hit, our daughter just loves it (age 6). We have already added several pet shop animals to the set. Great toy full of hours of imaginative play."
3,Littliest Pet Shop Playground,My daughter received this for a Christmas present and within the first five minutes the merry go round stopped working. But she does love playing with it and will for hours.
4,LPS-neverending supply of things to step on...,"Great toy--lots of fun things to do--more so than many of the other ones to come out. My daughter received the Get Better Center, the Round 'N Round Pet town and this and she loves this one the best. Lots of little accessories to use (and step on)..."
5,A Winner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best toys I've bought in years. Sometimes people don't realize the value of pretend play.My daughters spend hours playing with this toys. It's much more functional than the Littlest Pet Shop Playhouse. This toy is very well built for a plastic toy and I don't impress easily. Definately the best $30 I have spent in a long time! BTW it doesn't come with the monkey shown on the commercial, my advice is look for those too..My daughters love these pets.."
4,Great fun!!,"My daughter just received this for Christmas. This is by far her favorite present. She loves all the different things to do with the pets like the hammock, the wind up swing, the elevator, the magnetic race course, and the slide. The pets are absolutely adorable and I love that they are magnetized so they stay on the sled or swing or whatever you put them on without flying off. Certain parts will occassionally come off like the hammock and the tunnel on the race course, but they are easy to reattach. Overall, a fun and creative toy."
5,Best maternal care,"This is a passionate view of the most dignified and underrated of professions, Mothering. Dr. Kawasaki defends a mother's right and need to breastfeed and participate in the daily care of her children and has researched her subject thoroughly, providing a look at contemporary parenting with an informative and balanced approach.Every new and expecting mother should read this book, as should the obstetricians, doulas and pediatricians that mothers often turn to for sound advice."
5,Simply the best CD ever,"I have a very stressful job in Sales and I am often on the road. There is one thing that I cannot forget when I pack: this Simple Medidations CD is just amazing. After 30 minutes in my hotel room, I feel calm, de-stressed, so relaxed that the following morning, I am serene and I can deal with even the most difficult clients. I highly recommend it."
4,good system - hard to program,"We run these phones (and the associated PBX) at work. They work well and are durable. Panasonic tries to keep programming for dealers only - probably because it is so poorly written that you need to attend a seminar to understand it. It only runs on Windows and seems to be DOS based. Before you buy any propretary phone system check out how easily you can access and change the operation of the switch. It has nice features of which we only use a small subset, you can program buttons to do all kinds of things but when you run out there are a lot of keystrokes to access other features. Very scalable up to 8 lines and 20 extensions. It also does doors and pa systems. Caller ID is limited to incoming call info with no history."
1,It basically sucks,It's tiny. And the dirt is in the middle with a little piece of tape over it. It's so obvious that it's a prank.
2,Thought it'd be funny,I thought it would be funny but the thing is that the dye is inside of a small backdoor on the soap. The opening is covered with a piece of white cloth or tape or some kind of fabric. It takes a few times of use perhaps in the shower before the dye starts coming out. Either way its black dye and basically I don't think this prank can go unnoticed with the way they back opening is on the soap. darn!
2,Fell apart,when i went to go put this in my friend shower it broke in my hand and the dirty stuff got all over me so i pranked my self i guess. i can't speak for everyone but my experience was not a good one.
4,Actually 4.5 stars...,"This CD combines the diverse voice of Sarah Brightman with amazing music to create a CD that you won't want to take out of your CD player. While you might be hesitant about buying an opera singer's CD, you will be amazed by how many different types of songs Sarah Bringtman can perform. Some are pop and others alternative, some mellow and others uplifting. I won't lie to you, a few are opera-ish, but even non opera lovers, like myself, will find this CD extremly enjoyable."
4,Not Quite Eden,"Sarah Brightman's fourth thematic recording (preceded by Dive, Fly, and Eden) is the most classical to date. It is among the most beautiful albums I've ever heard, and Brightman's vocal performance is right up there with Eden and Phantom of the Opera. The only problem with this CD is that it doesn't quite contain the force of the previous CDs. That fits in well with the moon theme, but makes for a slightly less interesting listen. Overall, though, this is among my favorite CDs, and it's a must-have for any Sarah Brightman fan. Her tradition of meaningful lyrics, as opposed to the abstract and/or trite lyrics popular in today's market is not broken here. My personal favorites are Figlio Perduto, Hijo De La Luna, Gloomy Sunday, and First of May."
2,Not her best,"As a big fan of Miss Brightman's work, we felt this was poorly produced. Her voice does not come through with the pure magic that she has available to her. The producer(s) has over done it and drowned out her beautiful voice that makes her shine. Earlier CD's are much better than this one, in our opinion."
4,"Definitely pretty, but not innovative","La Luna is beautiful throughout, but I did miss the hip hop/classical amalgamations she is so good at doing. There are no surprises like Anytime Anywhere off of Eden. Even her earlier effort ""Fly"" had more innovative tunes. I would've loved to have given this CD 5 stars, but I feel it's a slight step backwards in terms of adventurousness."
2,Arf Arf,"Time To Say GoodBye was my first experience and it had me thinking that this lady could sing to me anytime with that sultry voice of hers. WOW. And Eden was even better. How much better can she get? So, I read some very much positive reviews about La Luna and bought it thinking this must really be good. What a disappointment. Scarbourough Fair? Hated it then. Hate it now. I think the song selections are unfortunate in that the songs in themselves are unremarkable for the most part but also prevent her from displaying her remarkable voice like In Pace did or O Mio Babbino Caro on GoodBye and just about everything on Eden. La Luna...might as well go bark at the moon than waste your time or money on this one."
2,La Looney,"Most tracks are just wrong. Maybe she could tone down on the special effects. The ones where she's singin like she's in ""heaven"" are okay..like serenade. Focus on those maybe. Plus I think it's corny the way she sings in so many languages. She spreads herself too thin.tries too much."
3,Not as good as her other discs...,I'm not saying this CD is bad by any means... it's just not as good as her other ones. It's too artificial. :-(
2,Charlotte Church + ABBA = Luna,"Yuck, yawn, gimmie my money back.Lacks real compositon and production value. Not worth spending your $$$ on. I'm sticking with Enya for my cosy fireplace nights.Who needs spacy remakes of ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" anyways?"
4,Angelic Voice,"Another triumph for Sarah. Her combination of classical and popular tunes is wonderful. Her sweetly melodic voice in ""Scarborough Faire"" and ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" is a joy to listen to. She blends these songs with more classical faire, which really doesn't challenge her vocal abilities enough. This is a wonderful CD to listen to on a rainy evening. It is calming and relaxing and a pure joy to experience."
5,A wonderful album!,I would highly recommend this album. Sarah Brightman has suchan angelic voice. I have been a fan of hers for many years.Her album are always wonderful. I'd give it more stars if I could.
5,This album is my companion!,"I have enjoyed other albums my Sarah Brightman, but was never REALLY thrilled with them. However, this album , for me, is absolutely fantastic. The production is careful, there has been a lot of thought in it, and the sound is spectacularly beautiful! It is an album that permeates the soul, leaving one wonder why there is anything to worry about. It is a 'crossover' album in the most proffessional sense. UNIQUE...I have never heared anything like it, and I am sure,(as a 27 year old) that it shall remain with me on my travels for the rest of my life!!!!!"
4,Eden: The Sequel,"Sarah Brightman is the epitome of middlebrow kitsch and, if you like that sort of thing (I do), you won't be disappointed by her newest release. A couple of reviewers have noted that the music, at times, almost drowns out her pretty little voice and they're right. Perhaps it's time for SARAH UNPLUGGED."
2,Sterile,"I loved Eden, but La Luna pales in comparison, suffering both from a cringe-inducing rendition of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" and rather bland orchestration through every other song. Her attempt to out-Dido Dido (on ""Here With Me"") is not outright embarassing, but shows how a passionate song can be dragged down to muzak-level (or not quite) when the re-invention is given generic production. Who is to blame? Frank Peterson, the producer, should have realized the whole album was taking on a quaalude-in-Southern-California ambience and tried to bring some real life back into it."
2,A different opinion,"I love SB, but I don't love this CD! To me it is totally boring, with every song sounding the same. I have several of her CD's and love them all. This one is a disappointment. There is no excitement to it, just boring songs. She has a marvelous voice and I prefer her other CD's to this one."
5,Breataking and Insirational!,"Sarah is an absolutly INCrEdIBLE vocalist with an unmatched authority. I am a teen who stumbled across sarah in my art class, where one of the students played the cd, and am in absolute awe at the grace and purity of Sarah's voice. She is angelic and majestic, and her voice fills the gap between the emotions and how the mind interprets these feelings. Her entire heart seems to be on the edge of her tongue, expressing untold feelings into her music that any music fan can enjoy. Her classicle style mixed with a more popish sound is a huge breakthrough and is step towards perfection! Absoluty incredible!"
3,Oops...I haven't got this yet.,"And in spite of being a fan of Sarah Brightman and buying seven of her albums, compared to five of Andrea Bocelli's, I am now unsure as to whether I actually AM interested in getting this album when it hits US stores in September. My favorite is ""Time To Say Goodbye,"" and ""Eden"" and ""The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection"" aren't too far behind. Maybe I'll have this album either for Christmas or on my 18th birthday. Still, the way I'm feeling about this Sarah Brightman domination thing in the world (but ""Time To Say Goodbye"" must be excluded from this dilemma), I'd rather save my money for Andrea Bocelli's next album."
5,"beautiful songs sung by the ""angel of music""!","La Luna is a wonderful cd, which nobody should miss out on getting. The songs are magical, and will capture you immediately. Sarah's voice seems to be perfect, and is maturing with every cd she does. La Luna has the perfect mix of music, and is ideal to listen to at any time in the day. Don't deprive yourself of this wonderful cd!"
5,Sarah returns with her voice of an angel,"I love her voice and everything she sings! In every one of her CD's there is always one special song of significance for me. In ""La Luna"" I especially like ""A Whiter Shade Of Pale"" this takes me back 20 years and reminds me of sweet and unhurried days, hoop earrings,cheap wine, and parties with lots of LP records."
3,Over the top,"What pulls this up to 3 stars is Brightman's voice; what pull it down to 3 stars is the extreme way-over-the-top production. I had to make sure it wasn't produced by Phil Specter. Well it was actually Frank Peterson who manages to throw everything at us, including an echo chamber, reverb, distortion, lush strings, drums, a choir - I think I even heard a bagpipe in one cut. This is what they did with Paris Hilton to hide the fact she can't sing. Well, Sarah can sing but you really have to work to hear it. She got some bad advice on this one. Hope she can find a producer who can highlight her marvelous voice and not cover it with all that extraneous noise."
5,Hija de la luna,"She is just what every opera singer should be: a star that shares her talent with anybody, no matter what kindda music is. Contemporary opera singers (Placido Domingo, Pavarotti, Bocelli) try singing more popular music, but they keep their liric style with no other attempt. Sarah is the most transparent voice I've ever heard. Of course I love her liric side, but with this CD, she is amazing specially singing Hija de la Luna. Her spanish is almost perfect and the way she sings it is just a phenomenum."
1,Pale as the Moon,"This La Luna is La Nada for me. It's tinny, thin, transparent, vapourish, no soul, sung as tho' she's ""camile"" two steps from her death bed.Darn, I like Ms. Brightman's singing, pleasure to hear/see her on PBS concerts... but this album is dull as dish water.The ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" was so pale as to be non-existent and drove me to buy the original Procol Harum version on The Big Chill CD.If this be cross-over, then cross-over be damned."
5,A Wonderful Tribute to the moon,"Sarah fan's...she's done it again. Following the same style that made Eden the best album of her career, Sarah gives her fans another radiant experience. ""La Luna"" is a tribute to the moon. She brings a folk feel to many of the songs on this album, as well as the classical crossovers we have all come to love. The use of Beethoven's 7th in ""Figlio Perduto"" is just beautiful. Her cover of Dido's ""Here With Me"" is excellent. The title track holds in it a bonus for fans who don't shut the album off right away. I'm a big fan, and was in no way disappointed in this album. Well done, Sarah."
4,"A Fine Accomplishment, yet not the Best","Sarah Brightman, the ethereal soprano who has enchanted audiences with such albums as ""Eden"" and an underrated performance in ""Phantom of the Opera,"" continues to show both her range and vocal ability. In this collection, ""La Luna,"" Ms. Brightman shifts the theme to the moon, which comprises such songs as ""Hijo de la Luna"" and ""La Luna"" itself, among others. Yet it is her variant songs that prove most intriguing, such as the haunting ""Winter in July,"" her own superior version of Dido's ""Here with Me,"" as well as the enjoyable chant ""This Love,"" all of which, however, are more captivating than other songs on the album, such as her fine, yet breathy, homages to ""Gloomy Sunday"" and, ironically, ""Moon River"" (Extra Track). While it falls slightly short of her last labor of love, ""Eden,"" one can not say that the album does not come together in the traditionally wonderful cathartic experience that is Sarah Brightman."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this CD after falling in love with Sarah's work on Time to Say Goodbye and Eden. It was a big disappointment. It was labor to listen to it, whereas with her earlier mentioned CD's it was joyous and effortless to listen to her. After forcing myself to listen to the first 9 songs, I started skipping over the remaining tracks. The songs on this CD don't show off her fabulous vocal range at all. If you want to listen to another CD like Eden or Time to Say Goodbye, save your money and don't buy this one."
1,Poor,I and my wife were very disappointed by this recording. We both are Sarah fans but this recording appears does no justice to her voice at all.
5,"THE WHOLE ALBUM IS AWESOME, 3 TRACKS IN PARTICULAR.","I prefer Sarah sing more POP music, for I knew her since "" DIVE "" her best album so far, in my opinion. And since she cooperate with Frank Peterson, I even consider her as a member of "" Sandra's Family"". For they both got similar ethereal atmosphere in their music.Sarah's ambition obviously more than this. When classic meets pop, "" LA LUNA "" is a brilliant showcase of diverse musical elements, from classic to trip-hop, jazz, good combination, better than "" EDEN "". I'll single out 3 tracks as my favorites : "" SCARBOROUGH FAIR "" everybody loves it. "" WINTER IN JULY "" kinda like Sandra's feel, I think so. "" HIJO DE LA LUNA "" She sing in fluent Spanish, so stunning. Let alone the melody is hauntingly beautiful. A worth-while album."
4,Another great album!,"I have collected almost all the Sarah Brightman albums and enjoyed adding this to my collection. Her voice is so tender, yet of such perfect quality, that I can sit back and relax while listening."
5,what can you ask for more?,i bought many of her CDs. this one a pure enjoyment. what can you ask for more in this world? i enjoy playing this album at night because it has the power to bring me to another world where my heart can find a moment peace. LOVE SARAH!!!!
4,Very beautiful magnets,"I bought these as a party favor and they are very pretty. The magnets are oversized, and the artwork on them is very unique."
5,Great Grammar Reference!,"Kate's, ""You Can Learn To Write"" is an excellent book. It gives step-by-step methods for teaching grammar. It also includes techniques to use in teaching the skill of writing sentences, paragraphs, and essays."
5,"Es tan amplio, tan bien documentado y","tan limpio, que en varios estados mexicanos, se esta usando como libro de texto en las secundarias.Puedes ponerlo a ciegas en manos de tus hijos y tus hijas"
1,Not happy,I bought two tailgate cables from this company on two different occations. Both were for the exact same vehicle and both were different lengths (by at least 2 inches). I would not recommend this company.
2,You might as well read an Arabic newspaper,"I bought this book after hearing the praise about it; I sold it a few days later. Despite the title, this book isn't much of a course at all. Most of it is just straight Arabic text for you to read, with no translations, so you don't even know if you're reading correctly. The book does a better job of teaching you (if you know Arabic) about the Middle East than it does teaching Arabic."
4,Alabama : Atlas of Historical County Boundaries,If you're interested in this sort of thing as I am this book could be of great value however the price is unreal. I have a CD that does much the same for the entire country at a third the price of one state however this book is MUCH more accurate and shows county boundaries that only occured for as little as three days. The CD is also easier to use. That said I'll likely ask for the book as one of those Christmas presents I wouldn't buy for myself.
5,Brilliant and utterly compulsive reading,"This is a brilliant and compulsive book, though in its dissection of our cultural malaise far more terrifying than any escapade by Hannibal Lecter. Read it if you care about the future of civilization."
1,"in science, truth matters","For heaven's sake, do not assign this to students as part of a ""psychology"" course. It is inaccurate, sloppy, and discredits the science and scientists. If you are teaching psychology, you should be teaching about the importance of evidence. If you really want your students to learn something important, have them investigate the controversy surrounding this book and critique it using the original studies and scientific standards. Now that would be educational!"
5,an excellent companion to course work in psychology,As a professor of psychology (both grad and undergrad) I have long sought out texts that reflect and expand upon the major trends in psychological literature. OSB does this beautifully. It manages to tell the tale of experimental psychology in a way that's accurate and compelling. I just wish Lauren Slater would next write an actual textbook; what a blessing that would be.
5,a great book,I'm loving OSB; I'm almost to the end and I have found it to be one of the most insightfulbooks re: psychology that I've read in a long time. Great book!
1,Unreadably overwritten,"Slater has OD'd on early Tom Wolfe, but she lacks Wolfe's ability to get under the skin of his subjects. Slater's prose is heated up but the author's viewpoint remains entirely anchored within herself. The most vivid psychological lesson of the book has to do with the author's self-absorption."
5,best psychology book out there,"OPENING SKINNERS BOX provides a fascinating journey through 20th century psychology while also illuminating the conflicts and achievements particular to that century. From Eric Kandel's work on memory to Milgram's infamous shock machine, this book tells the tale of each experiment in gripping narrative form. As a psychologist myself I can speak to the accuracy of the text. If I have one complaint it's that Slater has left out of her book several novel experiments. Still, read this book if you want to learn about the core issues in the history of psychology, or just read it for the pleasure of its extraordinary stories."
5,disturbing and fascinating,"I am a clinical psychologist, so many of these experiments I had studied during my graduate (and undergraduate) training. Slater's book is brilliant at bringing these experiments back to life, and into the public discourse, with her sharp wit and powerful imagery. I was able to see Stanley Milgram's obediance experiments and Harry Harlow's monkey experiments through a new lens the book made available to me. A lens that shed light on a terrain sometimes chilling, always thick with questions. I thought Slater's chapter on the Rosenhan study was especially fine. The book covers such a huge amount of terrian that it wouldn't surprise me if there were occasional small irrelevant errors (as the NYT reviewer points out) but as for the experiments themselves, Slater's research and reporting are top notch. This is a book I will read and return to many times."
5,Amazing Book,"It's an amazing, beautiful, brave and brilliant book, one meant to raise vital issues for the common reader. ""Who are we? What makes us human? Are we truly the authors of our own lives? What does it mean to be moral? What does it mean to be free?"" (Opening Skinner's Box, page 3) Yet those who perseverate on items best left to copyeditors and factcheckers threaten any chance at genuine conversation. Again, read Slater in her Introduction: ""Our lives, after all, are not data points and means and modes; they are stories--absorbed, reconfigured, rewritten.""Her book and its reception is perhaps a psychological experiment of the 21st century, one in which too contemporaries in Psychology come across as viscious, vengeful, myopic, and just darn illiterate in the literary experiments of the 20th century essay."
4,Read more.,"I am surprised that multiple reviewers have not been able to read past the second page of this book before coming online and writing a review to the extent of ""SKINNER'S DAUGHTER IS ALIVE!!!"" Don't you think that if you, random hokey of the world, realize that B.F. Skinner's daughter is alive, than the person writing this book would also know? Perhaps not.. But! If you continue to read past page 2, past the interview with Skinner's other daughter, past the various places where she emphasizes that both daughter's are alive and well, and that Skinner was not such a bad man, then maybe you can come to the conclusion that Slater doesn't know what she's writing about. Don't let her style of writing confuse you. She is not only writing a book on psychology but also telling a story with a personal narrative. Read past page 2."
1,But is it True?,"Slater is a very talented writer, and she has produced a book that purports to allow non-technical readers in on the most important psychological experiments of the modern era. She has chosen well, and the experiments described are indeed very important ones. Unfortuately the book is filled with errors, distortions, misinterpretations and, probably plain lies. Slater is a self-confessed liar, who has written a memoir about her own pathological lying. Apparently she cannot stop."
1,I got to page two...,I made it to page two of the text (page seven of the book) and got disgusted with her style.From this page alone: ka-boom. And this man Skinner. maniacal psychologist. baby in a box so as to raise her. whatever humanity he touched turned to bone. [?]. This I know to be true. This much we presume we know. Genuine court of law. Boom-boom went the gun.Note there is not one quotation mark here. THIS IS HER WRITING and the editor's editing. I don't know if I can go on! I'm very sorry I bought this book.
5,I've really enjoyed this album,It took me a while to get into some of the songs on this album but now that I have I think they're great! Each of her CDs are good and she puts on a great live show. I definitely recommend this.
4,"Fascinating search for the Fifth Man, true life intelligence","Story of British spies ~ MI5 in particular ~ from one who livedthrough it. Wright was the first scientist to join MI5, the domesticspy-catchers, and led the way for others. The bulk of the book is taken up with the search for the Fifth Man ~ Wright's candidate is Roger Hollis, who was head of MI5 during the early Sixties ~ a well-hidden Soviet mole like Philby and his ilk. Reading it, at times, it appears that Wright considers himself responsible for every innovation in spy technology during the '50s and '60s, but if you can get over his view of himself, the book becomes a fascinating read, on a par with anything Le Carré wrote. As far as the Fifth Man goes, my mind is still open, but Wright gives excellent cause to suspect that Hollis probably was at least bent, if not broken."
2,Sigh.,"Well, the book is certainly engrossing. Unfortunately, it's likely to be 30 to 70% fiction. A lot of what he writes about the Venona project is contradicted by official histories at the NSA web site. The several chapters on his ""discovery"" that radio receivers could be tracked by their emissions is completely false. US Navy radios since 1935 were specially designed to avioid this well-known effect. There's absolutely no truth that he informed the CIA about this circa 1960 and they didnt previously know about this.Now some of his stories may be true, but when an average Joe Schmoe like me can poke holes in 35% of them, just out of little tidbits of radio knowledge, how likely are the other stories likely to be true?"
3,decent inexpensive speakers,These speakers sound pretty good and are decent speakers for the price. The bracket is very cheaply made and will bend if you twist it or pull on it. The mounting nuts do not fit tightly so the speakers swivel downward when mounted horizontally. I had to add extra screws to hold the speaker upright. I have not had these long enough to rate their longevity.
4,nice sound for the size,These little speakers have a nice sound for the size. I have them outside on the eaves of my sun porch so the acoustics aren't the best but the sound is still clear and the bass is good.
3,Read the specs,"After deliberating to buy these or not, I read the specifications. These are not for home theater or stereo systems. The rating is 4 ohms not 8 ohms which is a requirement for home theater and stereo systems. Anyone hooking these to a system that delivers 8 ohms will kill these soon as you turn up the volume if they work at all."
4,Pretty Good Film,"First, I watched this film because of the Director. I loved his film The Caller. It was awesome.This is an earlier work, and I think it shows some lack of maturation. But overall it is a good effort.My main complaint is with the first half of the film. Before the audience gets the ""surprise,"" it looks like a very undeveloped, cliche and one-dimensional love story. Once the surprise part begins, the film picks up tremendously.Perhaps the first half should have been shortened. I actually stopped watching it, but then went back and finished. I'm glad I did. Before reaching the mid-point, however, the film seemed quite cliche.Finally, most of the second half was excellent. The very final moment, however, was a bit flat. Still, it was enjoyable, aside from the criticisms I listed. It is worth watching. Just hang in there and keep an open mind."
2,trimming could have saved it,"Clearly the writer/director of this movie needed the discipline of a Hal Wallis-style producer. The ""love triangle"" surface story should have been trimmed so that the plot got to the twists quicker. The cast is also too youthful: more sophisticated and mature characters could have helped lend credibility and weight to the triangle without such ""frollicking otter"" time wasters as the stolen room service meal (some date!). The surface story's romance was so tepid and dull that I watched most of the film with the commentary, from which I glean that Parkhill was too much in love with his own script and directing duties to turn a nice concept into a tight thriller. I guess that's why they call such fans of their own perceived genius ""amateurs."""
1,DVD won't play,This DVD wont play in my DVD player. No good if its not multi-regional. No good therefore in Europe!
3,Gael Bernal's Bizarre Faux ENGLISH language,"A ""LATINO THEMED FILM SET IN ENGLAND"", that cross cultural pollination, by the director's intent, comes off as stiff, uneven, and displaced like the two main Latino characters: an expatriate Spanish woman able to work in London via European Economic Union labor rights, and a male British national of Portuguese descent. Latin American actor Gael Garcia Bernal, in his short, olive skinned compactness LITERALLY looks like a VISA overstay, with his loud, tinny English role chilling one's skin. HERE, when a wealthy, adrogynous and cruelly manipulative British film director casts his unsuspecting fugitive fiance and a desperate Latino actor in a ""reality based"" movie on romantic betrayal/hardcore sex, the two duped actors plot their revenge as their movie becomes a financial circuit hit, culminating in the director's murder, and his tech team's rigged imprisonment."
3,Very Good,"This film is quite good, it has a very interesting story line.While watching the movie, I found the flashbacks to be useless (not providing enough information), but once I came to the end of the movie, I realized why so much was left unsaid.I think the movie would have been MUCH better is Gael Garcia Bernal and Natalia Verbeke had spoken in Spanish to one another. It would have made it less awkward for a Spaniard (or a fan of foreign films) to watch, and much sexier."
4,very good and a surprisingly entertaining movie,this part of documentary style movie is very good and very interesting. it's fun to watch and quite worth it!
1,Disappointing,"After reading the first two (excellent) books in this series (100 Winning bridge tips & 50 Winning Duplicate Tips), I was eagerly looking forward to this book. However, this book was really disappointing. Having run out of good material, Mr. Klinger apparently decided to go ahead with a sequel anyway. Instead of the excellent bite-sized and extremely applicable tips of the first two books, we get vague descriptions of far-fetched situations and how to handle them. Defintely useless at the table!"
5,Fight Fat Works . . .Even if your'e not 40+,"I know this book is designed for women in and over their forties but the program can be accessed by women (and men!) of all ages. Trust me because I have been a patient of Dr. Peeke's for 6 years (I am 20 yrs old--you do the math!) and the strategies for weight loss and maintenece as well as coping strategies for stress she outlines in this book are issues anyone can relate to. I have integrated these strategies and gameplans (along with Dr. Peekes pearls of wisdom--I call them ""Peeke-isms"") over the years since I began this journey and they have become my lifestyle. Through following her program, I have grown over these six years into a confident, healthy, fit woman (I have also lost and maintained a substantial weight loss--over 80 pounds!). Dr. Peekes program and motivational coaching leap out of this book and any reader will find that they have their own personal lifestyle coach--and she's along with you for the journey of your life!"
1,"Promises a lot, but doesn't deliver","This book promises original ideas, and new information, but I studied it at great length, and couldn't find anything I hadn't read elsewhere, or hadn't found more informatively and better presented in numerous other better-known books. This book is really a disappointing rehash of things you can find in other, better books. You'd be better to read Andrew Weil or Larrian Gillespie's books on diet and nutrition, or even Barry Sears' Zone books, than this one."
4,How I cut my stress and lowered my blood pressure without Rx,"It took me years of failed dieting and finally two years of therapy to discover that the root of my weight trouble was caused by low self-esteem which led to excessive spending. I wish I had read this book years ago along with the other book mentioned, ""SIMPLE MONEY SOLUTIONS,"" by Nancy Lloyd. Each book has shown me unique ways to control the ""excesses"" in my life and slim down my debt and my waistline. My blood pressure has also dropped (without the use of medication) because I no longer feel stressed all the time and I am finally HAPPY!"
4,Be Prepared to Fight Back!,I first heard about Dr. Peeke on Discovery Channel's Body Challenge. I read this book cover to cover and it hit me; this is why I've had trouble losing weight! It helped me to understand how stress-eating was affecting my inability to lose weight; or to keep it off. I highly recommend this book and I'm not kidding about how much help it's been to me. The proof is in the 24 lbs lost and 4% fat loss in 10 weeks! What do you have to lose???
1,Who is Nancy Lloyd?,"Reading through these reviews has left me with one question: ""Who is Nancy Lloyd and what is her connection to this author?"" Does it strike anyone else as just a tad bit too much of a coincidence that every fifth reviewer just happen to have her life changed by reading these two books?Use these ""reviews"" with caution folks. Often they are just paid sells pitches and Amazon plays along because...hey, it moves books right?"
3,Fight Female Fat over Forty--better title.,"If you're a woman, buy this book. If you're a man, don't waste your money. Dr. Peeke has written an excellent book for women. Unfortunately, the marketing for this book suggests it is for everyone over forty. This is a gross misrepresentation, and a major miss by the book's editor of a much larger market for the book. After receiving the book and discovering its unadvertised gender bias, I had still hoped there would be enough crossover for men to make it useful. Not so."
2,I Expected Better Behavior From A Female Doctor,"""Doctor"" Peeke may know her physiology, but she doesn't understand the human heart. I found her rather cold, hard and analytical, as are many doctors. She seems that way on ""Cooking Thin"" and it's verified in her writing. I don't think Ms. Peeke has ever experienced a binge.I don't appreciate being patronized and insulted, especially by another woman! The ""menopot"" remark was uncalled for. If I wanted a drill sargent, I would have joined the Marines.It mystifies me that she does not take into account that height, weight and activity level play a part in how many calories each person can burn. I expected a little bit more accurate science. This is very much a one-size-fits-all approach.The material is the same old song you've heard from everybody else. You'll end up eating something like ""The Zone"" diet. So save yourself the insult and just buy ""The Zone Diet"".Shame on you, Pamela."
4,Menopot - a new phenomenon?,"When you're in your fifties and you can't get down to a reasonable size, when you've tried just about every diet under the sun and Trinny and Suzanne tell you you're a bell shape, apparently you have a menopot!! Or so I found out. This book looks at what happens after menopause and helps you understand what has happened to you over the years. I'm still studying it, but it is making a whole heap of sense."
2,Lacking in substance,"While the book does offer some helpful eating strategies, there is really nothing new to be learned here. Eating smaller portions & earlier in the day is not exactly rocket science. I expected more & was dissappointed. I have the audio version & the author's voice is grating to my ears, I wish I had gotten the book instead or better yet, waited to get the book from my local library. Aside from the recently confirmed findings that stress does contribute to overeating, there is nothing in this book that hasn't been stated better & in more depth in many other books or articles. Since the author is a doctor, I certainly expected more substance."
4,Covers the facts you need.,This book was recommended to me by a physician colleague also an over 40 female. It presents the research and data to help understand what's going on with us ladies that we gain weight. I like facts and data. I want to see the research and here it is. So one doesn't need to give up. It's not strong on a specific diet plan and exercise program. Get some other book for that! If you want to understand what is going on and be able to explain it to some other frustrated lady who feels like she can't loose weight this is a great book.
3,"Can the arrogance, doc","This book has some useful information, but it suffers from a couple of major flaws. First, the author ridicules her readers and clients by coining such terms as ""menopot"" to refer to perimenopausal abdominal weight gain. These cutesy-isms are unnecessary and demeaning. She would've been far better off using more respectful terms than ""pot"" to refer to abdominal fat deposits.The book also is cluttered with anecdotes and has a difficult time getting to the point. Many readers neither need nor want the rah-rah of all those case studies -- they want INFORMATION. The book feels padded, rather than substantial. Hmmm...I guess I could call that ""bookopot."""
3,Fight Fat After Forty,"The book is very informative, but too technical for me. I want to know how to fight fat after forty in simple terms. I know I am asking too much."
5,Great book!,"As Nouwen typically does, the book moved me. It was palpable and spoke with insight about the real emotions and observations that go into experiencing death of a loved one."
3,was well needed,at the time i was deployed on the USS Carl Vinson and i was in need of this textbook to complete an english class i was taking onboard which was great due to the impressive condition of the used book.
3,A Good Start,"This is one of the Queensryche albums I don't listen to often. It's not a bad album, it just has never lured me in like ""Rage for Order"" and ""Operation:Mindcrime."" It's quite different from their previous EP. The songs that I think best stand out are ""NM156"", and ""Take Hold of the Flame"" (one of Queensryche's classic songs). I think the guys were still kind of looking for their sound on this one and the next album was a true classic."
5,IF ONLY,"this is one cd that is a must in every metal heads collection. from the beginning to the end of the cd there is no compromising. ultra high pitch vocals and classic heavy metal riffs blaze through the entire album. VERY FEW BANDS in metal history have come close or have topped this gem. if only they pursued this genre, it really is a pity they wimped out after this. for those who own this and are longing for a sequel to warning i highly recommend crimson glory's first two cds and lethal's programmed album."
4,A Warning you won't mind,"This is a great cd, full of intriguing science-fiction-inspired tunes. Geoff Tate's voice was at its peak on this recording. He later became a chain smoker & lost a lot of his high end, but has quit now & seems to be regaining it a bit, as evidenced on ""Live Evolution"". Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I love this disc, always have. I hope this won't be judged just because it's a metal disc out of the 80s; why don't you stupid people give it a rest? If you weren't alive or growing up in that era, you have no idea how exciting music was back then. It sure as heck beats today's ""standards"". When I saw that a QR fan had given this two stars, I was compelled to write this review to ""up the ante"" so to speak. It's great & the remastering & bonus tracks only help to improve this 80s metal extravaganza."
3,Good album.,"This second album from Queensryche is pretty good. The Warning consists of nine tracks. It's hard rock with a progressive edge. It's not quite as heavy as their first release, though. ""NM 156"" is a song that's very progressive and futuristic in sound. It's quite an interesting tune. The Warning sports good musicianship, songwriting, and production. Geoff Tate does a skilled job with the vocals, too. His operatic singing and falsettos are cool. The guitar playing is also satisfying. My favorite song is ""Take Hold of the Flame."" The intro is really nice. This is one of their best songs. All of the songs are good. The Warning is respectable and worth a listen."
2,Not good.,"Sorry gang, I've lived with this album for 15 years, and I love Queesnryche and everything, but I just can't excited about this recording. The songs are not up to par with those on Rage, Operation, Promised Land, Q2k, and frankly, their sound has improved 1000 fold since their fledgling Iron Maiden-esque years. Other than ""Take Hold of the Flame"" and ""NM 156"" I cannot really see the point of owning ""Warning"", and thankfully those songs are available elsewhere.Only for the most die-hard fan of Geoff Tate's voice, in my opinion, or for people who couldn't get enough of that oh so distinctive 80's metal."
2,Helloween / Queensryche,"Helloween made an indelible impact and a significant contribution to the world of music. They are respected globally and inspired a generation of metal. Their influence is great and their career is prolific, with over a dozen albums. Their talent is unrivaled, not just the obvious killer speed guitar riffs, but their vocalists, especially their first, possess a depth of range (Yes - ask someone knowledgable in metal - and they will tell you that the first vocalist could hit lower and higher notes than even the Queensryche vocalist).I'll employ more efficient diction:Anyone who says Queensryche is of better quality, better sales commercially (especially this point, helloween blows queensryche out of the water here), or longer lived than Helloween - provides ample evidence of their ignorance.Helloween are metal gods in Europe, respected and known everywhere.Where as Queensryche had one good album, operation mindcrime, and then disappeared into obscurity."
1,"This isn't Power metal,this is totally Weak and Sorry!!!","I totally hate Queensryche!I listened to album's by them just to see why people compare them to Mid career Helloween,my favorite Power Metal band ever(Not to mention,band ever).And all I learned is that Geoff Tate doesn't equal a hair on Michael Kiskes a**!HE SUCKS!!!Beyond belief!His voice just annoy's me,when it's high,it's annoyingly high,and when it's low,it's to stinkin low.although it does match the glammy,rocky,poppy styled cr!p that they play.Only in the fact that it's usually Slow!sorry!and lame, musically,vocally,and Lerically.Although it's not as bad as Operation Mindcrime,the extremely glammy,and badly written album.In short,to compare this earlier band to mid career Helloween is an insult.To compare Geoff Tate to Michael Kiske,""is also,a Huge,"" insult!"
5,Masterpiece,"If you are a metal fan this CD should definitely be in your collection! Geoff Tate goes all out in this CD. His vocal prowess qualifies him as the most skilled singer in this genre being able to sing up in the stratosphere so naturally without strain. This album tends to have more of a metal edge to it than their later albums. Great profound songwriting, guitar work and superb vocals make this CD a metal classic by all means. Get it!"
2,"ABSOLUTELY, MASSAVELY GINORMOUS","This player is huge! I regret buying it every time i look at the darn thing. I have had it for about a year, and it constantly freezes up, and requires me to remove the battery to get it to turn off. The software has lots of options, and is not too user friendly. overall, do not get it, looki for something the same price and size, but much smaller in size. ii bought it because i did not want to fall victim to the iPods monoply, and i do recomend something besides ipod."
5,After a year Creative's Nomad still proves to be a great buy,"I was given this MP3 player last Christmas and over the year it has peformed great for me, which silenced all of the doubt about this player that other reviewers spoke of. This player has some nice features such as the EAX audio, quick song or artist search, and great easy to use software. I dont really like the Media Source software much for playing audio and video on my computer, but I love using it to manage all of the music and files on my MP3 player. The only thing I can complain about as far as features is the fact that this player doesnt have an AM/FM tuner built in, which the new Creative 30GB out this year has. However, with all of the songs you can load onto this puppy, finding something to listen to wont be a problem. If you are interested more in great storage, sound and value, then check out Creative's line of MP3 players. They will definitely beat out anything that Apple has to offer."
5,Simply GREAT,"I purchased this item the 4th of feburary of this year. So far so good. I love it: the 30GB lets you save up to 8.000 songs!! te soun quality is incredible you feel like you're in a concert!!. You can choose your songs by artist, genre album or all tracks! if you can't find the song you simply click on the letter which it begins with and the mp3 player will find it for you. The instructions are very easy to understand and it comes with its own CD to help you download songs into your mp3 player. If you buy it, you wont be dissapointed."
2,"Terrible battery life, & Creative Software stinks...","Battery life sucks big time! It's always on low.The iPods are nice, but overpriced. This unit gives you a lot of storage, but creative doesn't put too much thought into their products. Their software always sucks... For example you cant just use windows explorer to copy files, music over. You have to install a large software install which then gives you an explorer ""like"" interface. Why didn't these bozos just make this thing plug and play and act as a hard drive? It's not very convenient that way.They do however give you a leather case which apple charges too much for.I wouldn't recomend this unit."
1,IPOD is way better,If you are going to get this product be sure to get a waranty for it. I got this for christmas this year and luckly I got the warranty for it because it broke after one month and I didnt do anything to it like drop it or get it wet. I used my warranty and payed the extra money and got the 15GB Ipod and it is worth it for the money. I have even dropped the ipod once and it is still in good working condition. I would reccomend getting the ipod instead of this even though it is more money but if you are going to get this then i would highly reccomend getting the warranty.
5,BEST PLAYER,I love this little gizmo... I have everything I own on this... I only wish it could be embedded in my brain...
2,horribly outdated,"I can't believe Creative is still manufacturing these. This was my first MP3 player... BACK IN 2004! five years ago, and they haven't touched the clunky setup, tiny screen, or gameboy graphics. they haven't even come up with a slimmer model! That would MAYBE be worth 100 bucks.You might as well just spend a little more and invest in a nano or something similar. Ipods are pretty reliable and apple's customer service is excellent. Plus, It'll last you a lot longer and nobody will make fun of you."
2,Unreliable - the hard drive will break!,"I have bought three of these for my kids, and I'll certainly never buy another! All three have broken and been fixed under warranty, and now they are out of warranty and are breaking again. Each time the problem is a hard drive failure -- for no reason the drive just stops working, and none of the ""rescue mode"" options will fix it. It costs $130 to replace the hard drive and receive only 90 days more warranty, so it's not worth a repair. I don't know whether other Creative Labs products are more reliable, but I think that having all three of mine break is pretty terrible. For $675 I was hoping for better. I wouldn't recommend that others take a chance by buying this product."
4,If you buy this...,"...you'll probably need to make sure you carry a paper clip in your pocket. I use mine to reset the player when it freezes up when starting, this happens about once a week.The sound is very good and I had plenty of capacity to store my 400 CD's."
3,Don't drop Will break,"I had Creative Zen Xtra Mp3 player for 6 months. I bought it because of the low price. My wife has a ipod mini, the ipod sofeware and controls are much more user friendly than the creative. The software was very hard to find on my desktop once it was in installed, veryy odd. My Mp3 fell 3 feet onto a hardwood floor and that was the end of the hard drive for my Mp3. If you do get player make sure to get a extended warrenty. My next player will be a ipod or iriver."
1,Beware the NOMAD (non) warranty,"Before you buy this awful product check out the warranty- it is for only 90 days. NOMAD's business plan is to sell an expensive piece of equipment that will most definitely fail after 90 and usually before 365 days so that the unwary buyer will then pay an exbortitant fee to replace something that should not have broken in the first place and should have been under warranty if it did.Our first NOMAD's drive crashed in one week - the second lasted about 7 months. Our experience here is far from unique. When customer service wanted to charge us $120.00 to repair, we took the high road and bought an IPOD. We also shipped the dead unit to the company's president, who is apparently content with his dupe the consumer program.Caveat Emptor"
2,headphone jack,"wow...i really liked this player...then i opened the box. the software is horrible, headphone jack stopped working after 30 days. i returned and got an ipod. way better. the sound is good coming out of the zen xtra, but it doesnt work for very long."
1,WORST MP3 PLAYER ON MARKET,I BOUGHT ZEN XTRA AND THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS THE OS CRASHED OR FROZE UP ON ME. FINALY THIS THIN STOPED WORKING DUE TO HARDDISK PROBLEM. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY AND I RECOMMEND AN IPOD OR IAUDIO X5.
2,Their Warranty Says It All,"I have semi-mixed feelings about this player. The one upside is the price per gigabyte. It's close to the lowest in the industry. The sound is average and the software isn't much buggier than average for an MP3 player.On the downside the dinky 90 day warranty tells all about what Creative Labs thinks of the quality of this product. Mine died after just after the warranty gave out and I won't buy another. The second weakness is the directory structure. Everything goes in the root and is simply sorted by ID3 tags.Finally there is no support for any lossless file formats such as FLAC or APE formats. Lossless music makes all the difference in the world to those that prefer quality over quantity. With all the sleek 1GB flash players on the market, that's really the only reason I can see to have a player this bulky. I think I'm just going to wait and save for a Cowen X5 30 to compliment my iRiver 799t."
2,"Works well, for however long it works","I'm in college and I don't have enough money for an iPod, but it would have probably been worth the extra money if i had it. I treat my Jukebox like it cost me half a month's pay too. It worked great for a few months, and when the headphone jack broke, I assumed it was just my bad luck. I paid the $20 service charge because it was a few days out of the three month warranty, and went back to rocking when they returned a replacement. Now, just out of warranty again, it stopped working completely. I've sent it back a second time and when this is over, I will have paid at least $300 dollars total for the thing. It works well when it works, even if you hold it while jogging or working out, but you better be prepared to pay if you want to keep it working. Looking at the other reviews on here, I guess my case is unique, but I surely would have gone with the Dell DJ or even shelled out the beans for an iPod if I had it to do over."
1,Bad design :headphone adaptor,"Can't help feeling that another reviewer's comments about Creative's business plan might be accurate. Looks nice, performs well but the headphone adaptor seems almost designed to break. I suspect the 30 day warranty is because Creative knows this.I'm certainly not an Apple freak and would rather buy something else, but feel MOST reluctant to buy anything from Creative ever again. Oh - maybe that wasn't such a cool business plan on their part after all ..."
2,"Had bad luck with this, or had bad luck inflicted on me","I had two versions of this, both lasted no more than 14 months. In the first case, the headphone jack died (the left side just stopped working one day). I didn't feel like cracking open the case and soldering; I shouldn't have to do that.The second one suffered from incessant hard drive failures. I would spend a great deal of time transferring music, only to have the hard drive die. There are several online ""solutions"" for this, firware upgrades, resets, etc. but most of the time I was only able to load 25% of my files before failure.The final straw was that the power jack failed - I plugged in to recharge one day, then nothing. It was great while to the extent that it worked, but ultimately proved unreliable."
3,Headphone jack sucks,This worked fine for the first year or so I had it but eventually the headphone jack needed resoldering since it detached from the insides.
2,not good,it needs the disc to install it but it not on the box not even the cable to connet it to the computer
4,Thanks Santa,"I received the Zen Xtra 30 GB for Christmas after posting it on my wish list. I have to agree with other reviews regarding the software. The manual and help information wasn't specific enough for me, a moderately computer literate person. It took me about a 1/2 hour to figure out how to get things from the source to the player. Now we're up and running and perfectly happy. While surfing for stuff to download last night, I ran across an e-book sight. Being an avid reader, the idea of being able to download a book onto my player is exciting. The all-knowing web is telling me that the 40 or 60 GB player is compatible with this function. The 30 GB is not on the list. If I can't find a way around it, I may have to trade up."
1,Harddisk failure after 6 months,"Note that the user manual says you cannot jog with this device, which to me means it can't take normal teenager use. I'm not buying another one."
2,Reconsider buying this player!! An unhappy customer!!!,"Well I just passed the 3month mark with this Jukebox, and of course it stopped responding/playing. It was fun while it lasted. The sound quality was great. But that is moot now that it does not work. I wish I would have bought the extended warranty. Dont bother with Creative's online support. Have not received any help from them yet! I guess it goes without saying, you get what you pay for. I just wish I would have bought an Apple. Maybe it would have lasted longer!!"
2,Wait before buying this,"This is a decent product in respect that it`s fairly reliable, it`s small, holds a lot of files, and is cheaper than the ipod. The major problem is how it organizes music. You can`t just have files within files like windows explorer. You HAVE TO sort the music into genres or albums. For me, this is a major problem because, for example, I have about 2000 howard stern files. I wanted to just have something like a folder with howard stern, and then sub-folders with different bits. But you can`t organize in this fashion. It`s unbelievably moronic. Wait a few more months until something better comes out."
3,good while it lasts,i liked it. it was good for a year and a half... then crashed a few days ago. i bought it for under $200 instead on an ipod.... 10 gigs more for $100 less...good deal to me. one thing i hated about it was that it's so huge and bulky... somebody actually asked if it was a walkman. it was my prized possession... i had 2500 songs on it and lost them all....so for that i'm pissed. i plan on staying with creative and getting a 20 gig Zen Sleek Photo.
1,DON'T BUY.,"I got this Christmas 2003 and after the warranty had expired in July, a circuit blew and the screen stopped working. The cover ALWAYS pops off. I'm using it as a backup drive until I buy a Dell Jukebox 20GB or Ipod because I can't listen directly because of the screen.Go for the Dell DJ or Ipod... they make quality products. Creative Labs have awful support and makes shoddy products. Dell Jukebox has the exact same setup for the on-screen menu so just buy the Dell."
1,Expensive paperweight - 0 stars,"I bought a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 60GB player in December 2003. The headphone jack immediately failed within the 1st month, even though I took extra care in handling this unit, always had it in its protective case, and never dropped it. I received a replacement unit from Creative and wouldn't you know it, the headphone jack once again failed. Thanks for the previous review from ""seleniumdream"". I will be doing my own maintenance on the headphone jack since it is now out of warranty. Bummer that I didn't stumble across these reviews on this unit earlier. Now I only wonder if the hard drive is going to fail like so many other reviewers have experienced. The only good thing that could come from buying this unit is that hopefully it malfunctions within the 90 day warranty. If you want a good MP3 player buy any other unit except this one."
2,Zen Xtra Review,"Well, I my parents got this for me for my B-day in January(after I convinced them) and it worked....until about mid april, when the Hard Drive Shut Down...I had to call tech support which had me send it to be replaced. THis took about 10-12 days total. After I got it back around May 1st, it was problem free until now, when I got the ""Hardisk-Problem"" message again. I personally regret getting this and today, I will call Tech support to request a refund. I'll Prbobaly buy the I-pod Mini. Overall, expect it to break down alot. It is a cheap piece of C*** so don't buy it unless you want to go through a lot of repairs."
2,Nomad plays well but has battery issues,"The Nomad plays well and contains all the features that are advertised. However, after only 3 charges, I let the battery run down all the way and it wouldn't recharge. Called Creative and they asked me to pay for a new battery. I would not recommend this product because electronics are only as good as their power source. In this case the power sources does not function well at all."
1,Design Flaw in Headphone Adapter - Steer Clear,"In comparing the price of this player to others, be sure to factor in having to pay an additional $175 every 60-90 days of use. That's how much it costs to have the headphone jack fixed by Creative. Unless you're good with a soldering iron and don't mind fixing it yourself, this is a product to be avoided. Sad too because it worked great for the first 60 days. Shame on Creative for not fixing this defect free of charge."
4,Nomad Zen Xtra,"I have owned a Zen Xtra since they were first put on the market and have encountered few problems. I still have the original battery and the unit only needs to be reset occasionally. Its 30 gb storage is as much as anyone needs in a mp3. Though this model is probably dated by today's standards, it has been very reliable and has none of the battery issues of the ipods."
2,An oh-so-cliche-review....,"I bought this item in May of '04 and it worked perfectly...for ninety days. I tried my very best to take care of this expensive piece of equipment and the headphone jack STILL went out on me. You're lucky if you purchase this and don't have a problem with it. Sure, in my opinion its the best MP3 player out there- that is, when it works. Luckily, I bought a 2 year protection plan on it and I'll get my money back. There's just no reason to take yhour chances on whether you'll buy one that has a faulty headphone jack- you're better off going with the more expensive Ipod, or maybe even the new Sony Network Walkman."
3,"Good, but not perfect","I have a Nomad for about 8 months now. On the whole, I am glad I bought it, but it has its pros and cons.Pros:1)More memory for the money, compared to any other brand that I saw.2)Easy to add music.3)Controls can be operated with gloves on (very important, as I walk for fitness, all year.)4)Unlike the Ipod, battery can be replaced by the consumer.5)Backlit screen is easy to read.6)Good battery life.Cons:1)Included case is poorly designed- no viewing window and a belt clip that falls off your belt. (I bought a small camera case, to use instead.)2)Included ear buds were not comfortable for me (a problem with most jukeboxes)3)A bit bigger that the Ipod.In short, it's a good product but could be improved upon."
1,Batteries Need UpGrade,"This unit is great for meeting storage needs,30GB. This player has huge, unacceptable flaws. The bad news starts with the lithium battery. The battery(fully charged) does not hold charge longer than 70 minutes at a Volume setting of 19 or higher. What's worse, is that you cannot hear audible sounds under a volume setting of 16 through headphones. Even at full volume of 25, it is difficult to hear sound in outside environments. One more thing_If you shutdown the player after a full charge, and leave unit alone for anytime longer than 48 hours:the unit will need to be manually reset.In closing, this MP3 player is definitely not worth the hassle. Note:I bought two replacement batteries only to get the same disappointing results."
4,The only MP3 player I've had for two years now...,"And it keeps working great. Great sound, lots of capacity, the software is quite simple to use. My only complain has always been it's uglyness, it's so large and ordinary, but to me price and performance is more important than trendy devices disguised with eyecandy, so I've managed. But it did cost me $240.00 and for such a price, I've been more than happy with its performance. Great deal."
3,Decent,"I've owned one of these 9 months, but about 2 months ago the power jack started getting screwy. It basically refuses to charge unless I fiddle with it for an hour. I opened it and it needs to be resoldered in a very hard to reach place. I finally broke down and bought an iPod instead, and I can say for an $80 difference the change in technology is astounding (much better screen, interface, less annoying software). I far recommend the iPod to this nowadays (at the time it was a good deal for 30 gigs) The design is pretty ugly, it's larger than it needs to be, easy to break, the interface is irritating to use and the software is *horrible*. However, it *is* $220 so if you can live past these problems it will get you by."
5,This player is great! I would suggest it to everyone,I work with computers and know some of the deficiencies of mac. I wanted to share my music with friends and this player is great for doing it. I have had this since last christmas and have not had one glitch.I have friends who have ipods and say they hate Itunes. Well here is your chance. I like realplayer and it allows you to use realplayer to download your songs as well as other places. Do not stick yourself with just I tunes - get diversified. This player is easy to use and light weight for when I go for my morning runs. This is a great buy!
2,"If There's One Thing You Ever Do, Make it Not Buying This!","I find it difficult to describe how little I like this product. It paused, froze, shut down on its own, and even erased its own hard drive before I finally got rid of it. The battery, when fully charged, only lasted somewhere around 4 hours. And, in case you were wondering, it is emmense and horribly ugly. So save yourself the trouble and the money: Don't Buy It! Though it does work well as a paperweight - an incredibly offensive-looking paperweight."
1,to big and crashes,Get an ipod. This thing is the fatest mp3 i ever seen. It crashes and doesnt have a recorder or FM tuner.
1,Not Happy,"After my iPod was stolen, my wife bought me one of these. I stuck with it for about 2 weeks, but then I had to eBay it. In short if you've had an iPod, you simply cannot make the switch to such an inferior product. If, on the other hand, this is your first mp3 player you won't notice what a raw deal you're actually getting. I would only recommend this product for first time buyers, or those that value cost over quality. Just my two bits ......"
2,questions,does anyone know if the charge that came with is usable in europe or asia?and wat is the sliding piece on the charger for?
2,Not Road worthy,"I work in the music business, both in the studio and on the road Internationally.Thus, the concept of a device that could play thousands of songs, enabling me to listen to board tapes and compare studio mixes was intriguing.A friend generously gave me an I-Pod for Christmas.Having heard that there were stability problems with the I-Pod I decided to compare it against other players.The Creative Labs 40 GB was less than the price of an I-Pod 10 GB with a bit better sound.Being a grown-up I bought a protective case, never dropped it (or the subsequent units) and was very careful about charging it (them.)After several returns I decided that, like many expensive sports cars, while a nice unit, (when they work,) the unit's poor reliability record, the time it takes to load and catalogue songs from the computer and the further time consuming hassle through which the stores put the buyer trying find and exchange the units, make them more trouble than they are worth."
1,good but not so good,"I got this mp3 player for christmas and was very happy with it untill one week ago. I was in school and i wanted to turn it on but it wouldn't go past the title screen. When i tried to erase all the memory it said ""hard disk"" problem. I had this mp3 player for 3 months and it broke on me for no reason.It was a waste of money and I would reccommend a different mp3 player.(I'm 15 years old not 13 )"
3,Amazing.... while it lasts,"I bought a Nomad because I needed a lot of memory for as little as possible. I'm on a tight budget, there aren't exactly a lot of jod oppertuneties for a 15 year old. I bought the thing about a month ago, and I loved it. In fact, I wrote a review for it here, ad gave it five stars. Then, the thing clonked out on me. I can't get music onto it, the software won't recognize it, etc.. So now I'm stuck with a 220.00 dollar usless lump of trash. I hope I can return it or something. Anyways, I plan on getting an Ipod, i suggest you don't make my mistake."
1,Poor performer in the MP3 line,"I bought this unit because of the 30G storage and the price was decent. I must admit the sound quality was very good. After charging it up initially, there were many preloaded tunes that were inaudible even at max volume. Same thing with tunes I loaded. Tech support was OK, they suggested bringing it back to the store to get a new once since the firmware upgrade didn't help or reformatting the hard drive either. 2nd unit worked ok for about 2 weeks. Went to use it after 4-5 days of no use, and I could power it on and that was it. No response from the wheel, power button etc...nada. Had to remove the battery to shut it off. It went back to the store and I got a Rio Carbon instead. Awesome sound, more compact, sleeker and functions much more reliably. No more Creative products for me."
5,"Excellent, great storage, sound, quality","I recieved this as a gift, and was astonished when i first downloaded my cds onto the unit. they transferred lightning fast, and no loss of quality. AMAZING storage capacity, up to 8, 000 songs. i already have 150, and i have only had it one day!!! I would recommend buying an extra set of headphones/earbuds. The stock set is usable, but cheap, breakable, and not great sound quality. It is better than the Apple iPod's because it had way more features, it may be slightly bigger, but the compromise is way worth it. this is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!"
1,American Pie,"I would not recommend purchasing this pressing! This album is one of my all time favorites and I was replacing my ancient original with this purchase and I am not impressed. The album arrived in a timely fashion, but the quality is certainly not audiophile. The pressing was not deburred and so many bits of loose vinyl were present in the jacket that I immediately threw it away and used a fresh one. After several cleanings to remove the residue, the album was finally playable, but has numerous visible and audible surface defects. I do not expect perfection in vinyl, but at this price tag, I do expect a much higher level of quality control and workmanship!"
4,bob dylan..youre not the only star lyricist out there,American Pie is a lyrical gem. It captures the tragedy of Buddy Holly's demise while using allusions and metaphors that defy even the most ambitious poet. Its in my top 50 list of the best rock songs of all time.
5,This cd is excellent.,"This cd is an excellent example of the singing and writing power of Mr. Don McLean. This one (compared to some of his others), has the full version of ""American Pie"", which was the only reason i had bought the album. But soon found out the album has alot more to offer. So just check it out and see what you think. It's worth the money."
4,Remastered And Sounding Better Than Ever!,"In the UK the 1971 single American Pie flew to the top of the charts where it stayed for many weeks and enjoyed massive radio airplay.It's a landmark song which continues to sound fresh and relvant even today.This reissue contains the lyrics, some of which I had not been able to deciper despite hearing it countless times.The album itself, to me at least, does not follow the title track's ""hit you in the eye effect"", with far too much introspective stuff and the depressing The Grave is a definite downer.Even the second single, Vincent, is hardly a bundle of fun.There is a far lighter song, the excellent Everybody Loves Me, Baby, which is rather a shock after all the low mood songs.I do like Babylon, which is based on Psalm 137, it really blows away Boney M's version.The bonus tracks are from 1992 and are no way essential additions to this varied work."
1,BEWARE: Ultra-Cheap Cardboard Packaging,"Nice CD in this reissue, but beware--the packaging is just a cardboard sleeve! Not a digipack which at least has a plastic tray, but just a VERY CHEAP-looking cardboard sleeve. Mine was already bent when I opened it. And I'm sure the CD itself will get scratched in time without extreme care in taking it in and out of the sleeve. Capitol Records should be ashamed of this shoddy product."
2,Product Good - Shipping Costs Exorbitant!,"The product, a music cd was a very fair price and came quite quickly. However, the shipping costs were almost double the cost of the cd, making this not a good buy. How much does it really cost to mail one CD to an address in the USA? They have to be kidding."
1,Don't get,Do not waste your money on this CD. It does not have the full-length version of American Pie on it!
3,He meant well..,I am a huge fan of Buddy Holly and as such was touched to hear that Mr McLean had written a tribute to his hero. The tune is pleasant enough and I was tapping along happily until we got to the chorus. Why is it that Mr McLean feels it necessary to repeatedly refer to the late Buddy Holly as 'Miss American Pie'. I think this is a preposterous and inappropriate epithet for such a wonderful musician. A pity.
4,American Pie...Title song is Awesome...,"This CD is great if only for the title song... Most people that I have talked to know American Pie by Don McLean, even if they don't know it by name. I enjoy some of the other songs on the CD as well, and Don McLean does an excellent job of conveying emotion into a very well themed CD, however, none of the other songs live up to the reputation established by American Pie. If you are a lover of oldies music, or even just rock and roll music, Don McLean's song American Pie is sure to delight you with its sad, rock and roll style antics. For the price that you are paying, it is well worth the music of this somewhat underappreciated artist."
2,oldie but goodie,Don Mclean did this song which tells the story (the day the music died) after the airplane crash that killed Buddy Holly and other well known music makers.I can listen to this every day! There are other enjoyable songs on the CD as well. I keep it in my car. I happened to see him on Public T.V. recently and that was the first time that I ever saw him.Any fan of the 60's music would probably enjoy listening to this.
4,strange but true,"The songs that weren't on the original album, that were included to fill up space just fill up space. I'm glad to have the music from the old American Pie album, but you'd think they would have chosen something worthwhile to put on the CD with it. c.tunney"
5,Happy in Haugen,"Received the DVD in alloted time and in good as new condition! I`m spell bound by the the feeling and depth of this man`s performance!My 51 year old son can`t understand how his 80 year old mother can so enjoy the music that she couldn`t tolerate when he was 16. Life lingers and people`s choices do change!Spellbound by,""Starry,Starry Night"", Sincere thanks Amazon andBob McLean,Happy in Haugen"
1,A Thoroughly Inadequate Treatment of the Natural Law,"This book provides a thoroughly inadequate treatment of the Natural Law. Fortunately, wonderful alternatives exist, such as J. Budziszewski'sWhat We Can't Not Knowand Germain Grisez'sWay of the Lord Jesus."
1,Critique of: Maxi-Matic EDB-302F,"The product is attractive enough, and heated up well enough, albeit somewhat slowly for as long as it worked.However, the reason I'm giving it only one star is because the large burner simply stopped working after less than 60 days use and it was light use at that.The double burner was not immersed at any time, it did not have liquids splashed on it, it was not abused in any way. It simply died!For the price there is simply no excuse for the quality of the merchandise to be so poor."
3,"It's OK, but heats slowly","For something that brands itself as ""elite,"" this hot plate sure heats slowly, and ultimately doesn't seem to get that hot. It cooks food just fine as long as you add your patience, and it is easy to clean up, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have a little more cash to spend."
1,Disappointed in Amazon,"I was in the middle of a kitchen makeover and needed a hot plate to cook on and heat up water. I ordered this hotplate thinking it would be perfect for me. When it arrived I noticed that it had obviously been used and that worried me. I tried out the smaller burner first and tho' very slow to heat up, it seemed okay. Then I tired the larger burner and immediately the house started smelling of burning wires. This had been returned as damaged to Amazon and it was just put back in their warehouse and sold again! It was a lucky thing I had remained in the room when I turned it on, as it very easily could have caught on fire.That was something that never should have happened and hopefully I won't experience that again. I purchase a lot from Amazon, and this is my first time being disappointed with them and hopefully my last time."
2,Not so good,It only heats up enough to boil if you have both burners lit. Otherwise it just keeps things warm. Not what I expected.
3,Seems good,The last one I had only lasted 5 years. This ones a different brand and maybe it will last longer. Works well.
1,Don't buy this piece of c##p!!!,This is the SLOWEST heating plate !!!!!! Don't waste your money! A small pan with about 5 oz. of water takes about 15 minutes to boil!!! Worst product I have ever bought from Amazon. JUST DON'T BUY IT!!!The worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,not working,"i bought this doble burne for a gift to my uncle in Mexico,, today we open the box to check it, but the small burner wasnt works only the big burner is working,im not going to take it back from Mexico in spend more time for return item,,, we all very disappointing about this product, i will not recommend this Maxi-Matic ed8-302f Elite Cusine double burner,,, beware..."
4,"fine, but scratched","Works fine, had a few scratches, but is not on display. So I am satisfied with my purchase overall. R.R.T."
2,poorly packed,"Original package was padded with inferior foam. It arrive dented and had to be returned.The second time arrived dented, but usable."
3,Great potential - average result,"There are parts of this book that make for a great spiritual adventure....but as the other reviewer stated......you are just hit over the head one too many times with theories on big brother and their ""implanted forehead chips"". And really watch out of you don't fully believe in reincarnation 100% as the author does. All in all a good read if you can overlook the heavy handed treatment and the reincarnation push."
1,Horrible Translations-Tolstoyans stay clear,"I am never one to write reviews but felt compelled to share my opinion on this collection in order to save a true Tolstoyan time and money. The Translations used in this book are choppy, inadequate and in many times looses the feel and intensity I've come to love and enjoy from my favorite novelist. I have read almost everything written by Tolstoy from War and Peace to Aloysha the Pot and come to know his style quite well and none of these translations captured what I've come to love. I have read these stories several times in different translations and found these to be the worse, the great bonus of this book is that it is an excellent collection but I would personally look else where before commiting to this one."
3,Tolstoy Short Stories,"Overall, I was pleased with this product. The book arrived before I expected it. The book itself, which was advertised as brand new, did not come in perfect condition. Also, the selection of short stories in the volume was lacking in quality."
4,worth reading,"I may be missing something, but the three short stories I read from this Tolstoy collection were good but nothing superspecial. From what I understand War and Peace and Anna Kerrenina are really his masterpieces, but The Death of Ivan Ilych is also well-known. There may also have been something missing in translation as well as across time and culture.I also read The Devil and The Kreutzer Sonata. Curiously, all three stories all inevitably lead to a death. Cossacks was written 1852-62, while the others were written much later in the mid 1880's. I felt that the later stories had a much more refined writing technique, so I never finished Cossacks.So those of you who want to get a taste of Tolstoy, these short stories may suffice, though I have a feeling that the only way to ""taste"" Tolstoy is to take that really big bite and read his major masterpieces."
4,Great guide with too few pictures,"This is a great guide with lots of information on everything. But the number of images could be higher to make it even better. Still, the best guide I had chance to use."
4,Good research and a believable plot,"Once i started, i found myself difficult to put it down. The plot recalls some movie scenes from Jackie Chan's, Speed 2, and The Hunt for Red October, but it's believable and well-thought out. Henrick did his sound analysis on China's accession to the status of a world power. One thing from the book-- Chinese subs have successfully infiltrated the US Kitty Hawk's Carrier battle group in the Pacific Ocean...wow!"
2,A Queen-sized disappointment.,"The premise sounded exciting enough, but ultimately the novel proved to be a huge disappointment. The ship doesn't even set sail until Chapter 9, and by then the book is half over! The chapters leading up to that are filled with long, dull set-up and a subplot that goes nowhere. And while the action in the remaining chapters is adequate, the ending feels very rushed. In addition, there are many boring technical descriptions that sound like the author trying to prove he did his homework, and some of the dialogue comes off as nothing more than the author giving the reader some background through the characters, rather than in the narrative. ""Air Force One"" is certainly is not!"
4,Nice Ring Organizer,I have a lot of rings and this is just what I was looking for to keep them organized. It seems well made--suede interior is a nice feature. Outside of case is just okay but the inside is what matters. Should hold up very well.
5,Very Happy,"I like jewelry, but my particular fondness is for rings specifically. I have a lot of beautiful rings, none of which I had worn in a long time. Why? Because of the way they were stored. I had kept the individual, original ring boxes they came in and most were put away in them when I wasn't wearing them. Those boxes were tucked in a dresser drawer. Out of sight, out of mind - I didn't even know how many I actually had and when I went through them it was like Christmas because I had even forgotten I had some of them. When I saw them all together I knew I needed one nice ""ring box"" for them all so I could actually see what I have. I am thrilled with this product. Now all I have to do is open this one box and I can see all of my rings at a glance...and am wearing my rings again. This box is attractive, functional, and a great value. I highly recommend it. My very thin ring bands as well as a couple really wide bands all fit just fine."
5,Dance/House/Techno/Progresive,"This is very addicting music. If you like house, or dance music at all, then this is definatly the CD for you. I have personally listened to this CD many times more than any other CD I own, ant thats over 140! This I strongly recommened."
4,Kickass tracks!,"So, I'm an avid fan of trance, dance, house, and most other forms of electronic music. I've been listening to (and collecting) this style of music for quite some time now. Many of the tracks featured on this 2 CD album are featured on some of the better trance compilations out there (Gatecrasher, Euphoria, etc.). I must say that despite the fact that these songs aren't beatmixed, I'm enjoying them quite a bit. =-)"
2,Dream Dance slowly deteriorating...,"Dream Dance 14 and 15 was without a doubt much better than the current volume 16. Volume 16 presents the listener with enormous amounts of electronic music, which is too much to handle. Previewing both house, techno, drum `n' bass, trance, and hard trance, the album is overloaded with short, un-mixed samples of music. Most of the songs are weak, and cannot even be listened to more than once or twice. A real disappointment."
4,Nice...,"I bought these at a local ballet shop, and they're very pretty... I like the leather much better then canvas or oh I forgot what it's called lol nvm.The pros: Pretty, easy to sew on ribbons... I haven't broken them in yet but they seem easy enough to break in...The cons: Low ankle in the back,and they are really wide, which ribbons help a little bit about; but I need the strings to keep them on my feet."
3,Good material - carefull with colors!,Good ballet shoes. Just be careful as it is not pink as it is shown in the picture. These ballet shoes are bege (or peach) - not pink as I expected it to be.
3,"good ideas, but not in 15 minutes","I like this author because she has great ideas for family traditions. But very few of these ideas can be done in 15 minutes, so I was not sure where they got the title. If you simply want some great ideas for starting up special ""family"" times and ideas for inviting other people to celebrate your faith with you, this is a good book."
3,Unsentimental telling....,"Overall, this is a clear-eyed look at a doomed relationship. Very engrossing until the major event--her lover's death. Then becomes merely interesting. Maybe Ms. Allen was so afraid of overwrought writing that her telling of her descent into grief-induced madness comes across as very detached. Another strange thing: she didn't adequately communicate just how madly she loved Jim Beaman. That's central to understanding her deep grief after such a short love affair (about 6 months).I found Patricia Kenneally's account of her life with Jim Morrison a far more effective memoir of a deep and desperate love. By the time Ms. Kenneally is literally trying to dig into Jim's grave with her bare hands, I was very caught up in her anguish."
1,Nothing like what I expected!,"I was expecting something new in the afterlife field and was dissapointed!!! The author rambles on and on, takes you back and forth in time settings sometimes you don't know what's going on. I found myself skipping chapters to see if anything further on interested me enough....but no luck!!"
2,Doomed romance,"Something was off-putting in the tone of this book. Perhaps it comes from lines like ""I love when working-class people say smart things."" Besides that, Allen struggles to understand a tragic romance, but she seems selective about what she reveals of herself."
3,Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional...,"Mary Allen's suffering made me wonder if she was merely stuck in the ""moratorium"" state of her own development since meeting/knowing/grieving over the loss of her beloved ""Jim"". Until she mentioned his age in her book (40!), I thought they were a couple of kids (more like early 20's!)! I really hope she's caught up to the emotional maturity her age would suggest by now! As far the topic of ""suicide"" is concerned, it is and will remain the most narcissistic act anyone can commit---don't buy the ""politically correct"" version that claims otherwise. Sorry she got dragged into the drama of his life at her expense! Just make sure you don't pick Jim II next time around! Mary in Northville, MI"
5,True Love,"Mary Allen could have easily been preachy in this book. ""You do drugs?!? Look at what happens!"" But instead she concentrated on the love story aspect of it. Although a main part of the book/plot does involve drug/alcohol abuse, it's shown as being integrated with their lives, not as seperate entities. It does lead you to hate drug abuse, but not by Mary Allen telling you to, but by the way you can see the role it played in tearing apart two people who loved eachother. Love was the main theme here, drug abuse and alcoholism were peripheral beings. I liked this book so much, I thought this love story was amazing and would leave anyone longing for their own significant other."
2,Not All I Thought It Would Be - Disappointing,"As a survivor of three suicides, I was eager to read a book with some substance. The beginning of the book was written very well. Mary is an excellent writer, however, she really missed out on the expression of her gut retching pain emotions that result after a suicide. She sort of skipped over those feelings and lived in this denial world. I have grown extremely in my spiritual realm as the result of the suicides that have touched my life. And I can tell you, the aching, can't get out of bed emotions were definitely not expressed in this book. Perhaps they are still too painful for Mary to write about, thus the jumping from one time period to the next. The gift of spiritual knowlege gained from a suicide was not presented in this book. I was quite disappointed."
3,"Too many questions, not enough answers","I really wanted to like this book. Its premise looked so unusual and thought provoking. Ultimately though I could never really connect with who Jim Beamon was or who Mary Allen IS. There was not enough background information which could help the reader understand why these two behaved the way they did. I remained detached from both characters and therefore, although there were several interesting concepts- I just couldn't relate."
4,A sad and very open story,"Mary Allen has written a very candid account of her love affair with an alcoholic cocaine addict that is, at times, so unguarded as to be embarassing. Why doesn't this intelligent, articulate woman take charge of her life and relationship? Love, and all of the inexplicable things it leads us to do, is the answer. I was engrossed by the first part of the book wherein Mary recounted the love affair and eventual suicide of Jim. The second half of the book, in which she recounts her search for answers rang true to me, as the surviver of a loved one's suicide, but was ultimately (and inevitably) unsatisfying. There are no answers out there."
4,rooms of heaven,"When I read the cover on Mary Allen's book, I expected a description of heaven revealed as a result of the death of her boyfriend. This, however was not the case. It was an outpouring of emotion, from start to finish.. a story of true love, gutsy, and uninhibited. For the strength of this woman alone, this book is worth the time. You just have to give Mary credit for putting into words, the affairs of the heart, and head, no matter how horrible they may sound. And, if you have ever been around a addictive personality, this may open your eyes to the light of day."
5,Unforgettable,"This suspenseful and elegantly written book seized my attention and wouldn't let go even after I finished reading it. As uncategorizable as it is powerful, ""The Rooms of Heaven"" recounts Mary Allen's attempt at transcendence in the aftermath of her lover, Jim Beamon's, death. For her, his drug addiction and suicide are not simply miseries endured but cause for meditation on the shock his personality, in all of its contradictions, has on her own. I have never seen grief depicted with such raw immediacy. But her, and our, passage through such grief leads to the soaring ending: literary art has become Allen's most faithful medium in bringing Jim Beamon vividly to life."
5,The best Beach Boys compiliation you could possibly want,"I am only 23, but I have grown up listening to this album. First on vinyl, then as my very first casette tape, and finally on CD. The Beach Boys became my favorite band of all time, via this album, and I have never been able to find a better compiliation of their greatest hits. Every other album seems to be missing some of their most well-known songs. This is truly the best Beach Boys album ever made. It is a must. It's just unfortunate it is also incredibly hard to find!"
5,Great Intro to Beach Boys Music,"This is the first album I bought with my own money. I already was a Beach Boys fan, but this gave me an overview of their music about sun & surf and hot rods. I couldn't listen to it enough. This southern California girl wasn't even born when the Beach Boys first got together, so the southern California romanticism really knocked me out. Brian Wilson's beautiful, harmonic arrangements just constantly put a smile on my face.While there is so much more to Beach Boys music than the simpler, carefree fare compiled on this album, it's a great introduction to anyone who's been hooked by the Beach Boys sound."
2,Sidetracked,"I've owned several of the Beach Boys compilations and few have been disappointing. This one is. I can't believe that a major record company would put out a product like this and not realize the mistakes involved. ""Help Me, Rhonda"" has an entire track missing, and it's blatantly obvious to anyone who has ears. ""Be True to Your School"" is an inferior cut. Why this one is included I fail to understand. It too is missing an entire track. There are other excellent compilations of Beach Boys material out there worth your hard earned money. Let this one slide!"
1,How dilightful this CD is !,"From the first time I heard this CD, I couldn't forget the chorus line of ""Sirfin' U.S.A"". Whenever I listen to this CD, I can feel a lot of fun and satisfaction very easily. I recommend every family have this. My favorite song is ""Be true to your school"". This song is covered by another surf music band, ""Trashmen"". This version is very good,too."
4,Flawed but timeless,"""Endless Summer"" is an essential compilation, supposedly the new 'remastered' ""Sounds Of Summer"" is so-called 'definitive,' but I don't think so. ""Endless Summer"" is more than a compilation; it turned the Beach Boys around since they were rapidly declining at the time.The LP/CD release is notorious for having stereo versions of the singles, and also incorrect versions of ""Be True To Your School"" and ""Help Me, Rhonda."" The gold DCC release fixes this by substituting the actual single versions, but it still has stereo versions of some of the singles (which is not bad at all.)If you can snag the gold CD, especially if it is a bargain, go ahead and get it, otherwise don't even bother with this disc. Get the double disc ""Greastest Hits"" from Razor and Tie instead."
5,Best Beach Boys Album Ever,"When I was in 6th grade my Math Teacher and I argued over who was the best band, he said Beach Boys I said the Beatles. After this he brought in a tape (I am after all 28 years old)I fell in love with them right away and haven't stopped listening to them. Up until 1997 I was going to the Beach Boys Concerts every year and they just happenned to play every year around my bitrthday. This was the first tape I ever bought by them and I later found out that my mother had the 33 (for those who were born after 1985 that is a big plastic disc that used to play music and believe it or not they had better sound than CD's). Anyway I just want to say that I love the Beach Boys and this disc is a good introduction for anyone to their music."
5,Forget the rest. Get the best!,"Don't mess with the box sets and all of that. THIS is the only Beach Boys CD you need. It says it all. It was the soundtrack to my high school years. The only other song I wish that was on here is ""God Only Knows"". A classic. You can't go wrong buying this one...."
4,"Decent for what it is, but be aware of PS/2 plug size","The keyboard works fine, and it's not as mushy as most keyboards in this price range. Don't expect the same feel as buckling springs, though. My primary concern is that the PS/2 plug is greatly enlarged for no reason around the middle, making it connect to my KVM switch at an angle pushing against the VGA connector, and I imagine it would not work at all on some motherboards if it were close to other connectors in use. The white paint lettering on the keys reminds me of keyboards from 25 years ago, but how that reflects its durability I can't comment yet. Also be aware it uses the small backspace and L shaped enter key style, which may or may not be to your liking. It's unfortunate so few PS/2 models are still being produced to choose from."
4,Easy to follow,Great book and easy to understand. Well worth the money for a beginner writer or even an experienced one.
5,A treasure trove of information,"I read the reviews for this book before I purchased it and agree with those who found it to be helpful. I am the new leader of The Random Writers Workshop in Bakersfield, CA that was started by Nick Belardes. When I needed to write my first lecture notes, the information in this book was invaluable. The author shows not only tremendous talent in writing an interesting and informative book, but uses an engaging style to deliver it. It is positively jam-packed with easy to understand advice for writing a book that will sell."
1,A horrible waste of time,"I have not learned a single helpful thing from this book. The ""techniques"" are totally useless and sometimes counterproductive, like the suggestion that a write not review his work with another person. Terrible. I instead highly recommend ""Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, Second Edition: How to Edit Yourself Into Print (Paperback)by Renni Browne (Author), Dave King (Author)."
4,Best Book Ever on How to Write Fiction,"If you want to learn to write fiction, then read this book. From the beginning, middle, and end, each element of the novel is explained in very careful detail. Here you can learn about the story question that starts the story and climax the process that resolves the story question and is the beginning of the end. Also the author explains how to move the story along using Motivation-Reaction units (read the book to find out what M-R units are).The author has been dead for many years, but the book is still in print and it is still being recommended. I found out about this book at advancedfictionwriting.com. In my opinion that shows that Dwight Swain's book has stood the test of time and is a necessary addition to any fiction writer's library."
5,Excellent!!!,The absolute Bible on writing commercial fiction. Study and practice the techniques in this book and I promise writing fiction will make so much more sense. I have my copy sitting by my computer at all times.
2,Is Everybody Not Tired Of Them!?!,"This collection by the Not-So-Fab Foursome is O.K., O.K.!?! 'The Long And Winding Road' is basically a lounge song (pretty, at best) overrun by Phil Spector's grandiose symphonics. 'Across The Universe' is more Lennon being a cosmic William Blake! I like 'I Me Mine' some, the Harrison track. But aren't his vocals always very nasal? Should a melodist like McCartney be in this band?... Oh! He got out!?! Thank God! 'Band On The Run' is so superior to anything here... Isn't eveyone tired of all this!?! Give me Neil Diamond! Am I the most hated man on Amazon? Ooooh! I'm shaking! Sorry Beatle fans, I have to let it be..."
5,The Stones wish they were this good,"When Let It Be came out it was already cool to hate the Beatles. Hard rock ruled in 1970 and that didn't include the Beatles. Even the Beatles were hating the Beatles. And without George Martin around, Phil Spector did some very unBeatleish things to some of these songs. Despite all that, Let It Be is still top drawer Beatles. With five songs that are as classic as anything on Sgt.Pepper and the rest brimming with the fun and spontaneity of A Hard Days Night. Has Paul ever written anything better than The Long and Winding Road or the title track? Across the Universe is John at his cosmic best and what is more poignant than Paul's Two of Us(even if it is about Paul and Linda). Forget comparisons and just appreciate the goodness of it all."
2,"Nice charm, but terrible clip",The charm looks very nice and went well with the charm bracelet my wife has. The downside to this is that the circle connector that comes with the charm very easily gets separated and the charm falls off. We had to go to the hardware store to get something a little more stable so that it wouldn't fall off and get lost forever.
1,Wayyyy too big!,I bought this for my daughter and she won't use it because it's way too big. Great for hikers.
4,Its good,This cd is good but not the best of Soulflys stuff. I would rather get the non imported stuff.
5,great music from a great tv show!,"this is alot of wonderful music on 2 cds. the song ""santa maria"" is just fun. even if you didn't see the tv show the cd is worth getting just for the music."
4,It senses oxygen.,"As another commenter mentioned, this is not actually the correct oxygen sensorfor the rearmost position on a 96 Honda Civic. The original had an O-shaped gasket and a shorter wire. Because I was attempting an unorthodox installation, this was not a problem for me. It's likely not a problem anyway, but if you buy it for that purpose, the wires will not be as protected as they may otherwise be. Besides that, what can I say? It worked. My check engine light went out.I will say that if you are replacing oxygen sensors in the exhaust, you should ensure that you are getting a proper spark in the engine. The reason I had to replace this was that I needed a new distributor, plugs, and plug wires first."
5,"Replaced both sensors, and check engine light turned off","My 1996 Civic (163k miles) check engine code for the (recently replaced) catalytic converter came on, and I read that the oxygen sensors that measure its health go bad after about 100k miles. I replaced both oxygen sensors with this product and this one: (Bosch 13007 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment), and sure enough the light turned off!One of the plugs was a slightly different shape than the one we took out, but I think that is a non-issue."
4,Still yearn for shared stories on our Romanian babies !,"I am happy to see this book. As a parent of an adopted (in March 1991) Romanian girl, I too, knew before I traveled, the effects of institutionalization on a child. I think that many parents do and did not. the book is a valuable tool for this purpose. It also shows the joy a child can have when loved and nurtured by parents willing to give what it takes !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,An okay read,Worth a read as it is interesting to learn about life in those times but a bit slow at times and most of the book set in one location.
4,"Another ""Grapes of Wrath""","The tone of this story is very melancholy but poetically so. I certainly wouldn't call it a romance, but it is a love story, and I applaud the craftsmanship required to pull off something this unique. I also admire the beautiful prose, the incredible historical detail, the way the author breathed life into her characters and wove her setting so tightly into the story. The book made me grateful for my own life and made me want to be happy for the sake of others, if not myself. That says something--when you apply what you've learned from a work of fiction to your own life. It means what you read was powerful. The closest thing to it that I recall is Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath."""
5,Wonderfull,I was lucky enough to see Jin-Roh in theatres in New York city. The movie is a wonderful example of filmaking that evokes emotion. The music is by the very talented Hajime Mizuguchi who is well known for his collaboration with yoko kanno on the soundtracks for vision of escaflowne and Macross Plus. The musical score goes with all the other elements of Jin-Roh perfectly. BUY THE SOUNDTRACK AND WATCH THE MOVIE.
5,Love the Book and the Author!!!,"Needed the updated version for a class given by Harriet... Herself! I had an older version, still good. She is an excellent teacher and the book is a must for my library. I think you should have it too! The techniques are valuable to any quilter! So much more in the book than just how to quilt.I want to turn my quilts over to my loved ones and say without flinching!!! that ""I quilted this for you!"" After all... If I didn't ""quilt"" it I cannot say ""I quilted this for you"". This is not to say that I haven't and don't have a long arm quilter in my rolodex! But simply that there are quilts that I want to begin and end at my hand only!"
5,4th Edition is an Extreme Makeover! Worth buying again.,"I bought the 3rd edition a couple years back as a ""supply"" for a beginning machine quilting class. I have referenced the book many, many times. I saw the new edition out, but assumed it was just a colorized version of the 3rd edition. I found the 4th edition at the library and checked it out for the sake of curiosity to see how different it really was. The 4th edition could be considered a completely new book. If you have an earlier edition of this book, the 4th edition is worth purchasing without a doubt."
4,Great step-by-step guide,"As with all Harriet Hargrave books, this one gives great detail, and lots of photos. Everything is covered from preparing your workspace, machine and quilt, to basting and finishing. Fourteen pages of heirloom designs for continuous line quilting are included to get you started. Lots of great tips!"
5,"Comprehensive guide, offering info on more that the process of machine quilting","This book was purchased in preparation of a class with the author. I expected patterns and information on how to use your machine to free motion quilt. However, this book is jam packed with extensive information that I was not expecting. Most books I have on this subject (8 already) all have a little bit of new information, and lots of fluff. This book is a wonderful resource and replaces all of the other books I own."
5,Walvoord,"Any book that John Walvoord writes is well worth reading. He is one of the greatest theologians in the history of the Christian church. He is extremely sound in his interpretation of the Bible. His interprets from a dispensational position, the only position that can bring about an accurate understanding of the Bible."
2,The Millennial Kingdom,I have studied prophecy for 40 years and found this book to one of the most difficult to study. I have other Walvoord books that are much easier to grasp.
1,Just Buy A Computer And Save Money,"Nice simple device, but $1.5K for this? You can buy two or three nice, small-format computers, *with* the little LCD, that have much more advanced features like a DVD burner, not a CD burner, and gigabit or wireless ethernet, not a 56K modem, USB 2.0, firewire, more format compatibility, more control over output formats, the ability to output to a TV for games, movies, etc., the list goes on.Rio is lucky I'm feeling generous. The one star is for being able to give it to me in one package. The pricing is atrocious though."
2,Kit is Incomplete,Kit Doesn't include necessary adapter needed to use the lenses and filters on Panasonic DMC-FZ8. Bag is very low quality. Very poor packaging. Expected more for the money.
3,Just okay,"I bought this book, because it was our Book Club Choice. Just okay. Others in the group liked it a lot."
3,1999 Suburban install,"I watched videos on the install before I bought the product but the install was a lot different on my vehicle. It came with extra clips and the instructions were a little unclear. Not as clean of a look as I wanted but I hope they work OK out on the open road. I have them installed and you are supposed to let them set in the windows for a while to seat in the window liners.Time will tell.Update.The deflectors did not work out on the rear windows, they just wouldn't stay put.Had to remove them before they fell off.Also, I like to leave my windows down a little in the summer time, this has created some fit problems with the front deflectors. It unseats the fit a little and the memeory on the weather stripping goes back to stock."
5,earthy,"This is a woodsy, mossy scent with a touch of sandalwood. It is different and earthy, which is why I like it. I have worn it since the 80's. I would not call this a flowery fragrance. More of a earthy spicy smell. It lasts a long time, also. This is a great price."
2,Bad smell,"I bought this fragrance because i saw the good reviews, but it smell bad and it is away too strong for a woman. it smell like cheap fragrances. fortunately i bought just the smallest bottle they have. but I'm giving it to someone else. i just can't stand to this weird smell."
2,Maybe I'm spoiled,"Maybe I'm spoiled by our high-tech society, but this DVD has terrible sound. It sounds like it was recorded in mono. Is a DVD supposed to recreate the experience? If so, Canada has some serious techinal sound issues to resolve. If you don't mind the sound going in and out, this might be the DVD for you."
5,JOHNNY CASH IS COUNTRY MUSIC,"This is johnny as we all remember him--pure classhis voice only got better the older he got,and you also get to see his beautiful wife -June carter cash -the raunchiest 60 year old ever.if you want to put some class into your life-get this and anything else he ever recorded"
4,Johnny Cash - Live at Montreux 1994,Have not viewed the DVD. I bought it as a gift for my daughter. I'm sure she'll enjoy it.
2,Sound,"Johnny Casgh was great, as always. However, the Quality of Sound was very poor. One would think, that when you have Johnny Cash on your stage for the first time, you would double check and double check. Shame on them, they'll never a second chance with one of the greats!"
5,An Amazing Concert,"No Matter Who You Are, How Old You Are. You Gotta Appreciate This. Johnny Cash Was An Amazing One Of A Kind Artist. When I First Saw This Concert I Was Blown Away! The Song Choice Was Great, And He Sounded Great (As Usual) I Was Happy To See Some Of The Songs From The American Recordings Album. The Best Songs Are Ring Of Fire, The Beast In Me, Bird On A Wire, Folsom Prison, And Walk The Line. If You Love Johnny Cash As Much As Me, Get This. Get Ir Now. You Will Not Be Disappointed. Rest In Peace Johnny :)"
4,"Watch an Americana Legend, Live","The Johnny Cash live show is captured in this remarkable performance from the 1994 Montreux Jazz Festival. Johnny plays through nineteen of his songs, with an appearance from his wife June Carter Cash and their son John Carter Cash. The band performs most of Cash's biggest hits and a few surprises. Being from his later time period, the show balances Johnny's ol' time rockabilly days with the 'folkier' songs from his American (Rick Ruben) period. At this point in his career, Cash's voice aged and matured like a fine wine. While a European jazz festival may seem like an odd gig for Johnny Cash, he nonetheless makes it work in style. Voices are difficult to hear during introductions and stage banter, but the musical sound quality is perfect. The video footage is straight forward without bells or whistles -just Johnny Cash and forty years of his music."
4,The Man In Concert,"Johnny Cash rules (see American IV), but the sound mix on this disc could have been a lot better. Thankfully, they give you a DTS track, but it's not a very good one. Fortunately, the songs make up for it as does Johnny. The highlight for me are the songs off the first American album, but plenty of oldies round off the collection. Anyway, for the money the disc is worth picking up, just don't expect sound like in Roy Orbison's Black and White Night DVD."
1,Lame then AND now,"This album , band , heck the whole genre was a joke . The same type of song played 12 times over gets soooo old real fast . The riffs and beats are just plain goofy and the cheesy lyrics , The vocals aren't bad though but who cares this is just stupid it's allright at a party I suppouse but as far as real rock goes this don't cut it . You want real good rock from the 80's look into - Guns N Roses , Iron Maiden , Van Halen , Metallica or Anthrax and AC/DC . Skip this pile of cheese ."
2,Drag It Out,"Poison burst onto the scene with this 1987 release and quickly became hair metal gods. There are some very catchy songs on the album like their ode to teen lust ""Talk Dirty To Me"", ""I Want Action"" and requisite power ballad ""Don't Forget Me"". The rest of the album is warmed over Kiss sound alikes."
3,This is where it all began.,"This album gets points for the cover alone. A four-panelled split image of dragqueen musicians who called themselves ""Poison"" scared the living daylights out of parents in 1986. Children were rushed into churches, medical clinics, treatment centers--you name it--so to be kept from the evil glam quintet. And we're not even talking about the music! Titles such as ""I Won't Forget You"" made senile old ladies with walkers jump off buildings. It was shocking! Oh, wait. No, that was ""Talk Dirty To Me"". That was the one (great solo, CC!).In the 80's, people were seperated into three concentration camps. It all depended on the music you listened to. You were either a Poison fan, a Motley Crue fan, or a *GASP!!* Bon Jovi fan. If you liked Madonna, they would just throw you into a cellar and let you starve to death. But the 80's hadn't ever really begun until 'Look What The Cat Dragged In' had been released."
4,"""Look What the Cat Dragged in by Poison"" 3.5 out of 5 stars, classic '80s cheese","Do they look ridiculous? Yes. Is this groundbreaking stuff, are they great musicians? No. I don't care, I like it anyway. The best Poison album in my opinion. Parts of most of the songs kind of sound alike(I think its CC's playing)but I still don't care. This is a fun album to throw in for a '80s flashback. I like it better start to finish than their later albums that followed, the later albums each had some hits but I like the rawness of this one. They do look ridiculous but you know what? It worked. Everyone knows who these guys were. There were hundreds of other bands that were probably better but didn't make it, these guys did."
3,Seemed Like a Good Idea At The Time,"I remember seeing the cover and thinking, ""hey those chicks are pretty hot"" along with my friends. Later when we discovered the horrible truth, we were disgusted, yet intrigued. But this is about the music, not how they looked. Most of the songs are 'Ok' but not in the ""Dream On"" caliber by a long shot. This disc is basically Poison trying to get their foot in the door, which they did. The only track that really throws me is the title track which almost sounds a little punk-ish! Strange! I wish I would've bought stock in Aqua-Net at the beginning of the 80's."
3,Glam?,"Is Poison glammy? Absolutely. Are they without any real musical merit? You bet.Is this disc worth getting? Yep.They may be simple, and somewhat cheesy, but they are also a fun band. They never pretended to be any more than that. It's that simple."
1,boring glam rock...who likes this music???,"I bought ""Look what..."" after having heard the title track, which was ok (the first 2 times I heard it), but I was more disappointed than ever. The music lacks intensity and the band doesn't have the same sparkling feel and drive that a lot of other glam rock bands, like Mötley Crüe and Cinderella, had."
3,Be honest,"When this album first hit the shelves, what hardcore heterosexual guy didn't look at this cover and point to the chick they wanted to bang? Yeah they looked that bad. Until the videos and Hit Parader photos came out, I thought this was a chick band.The music? Yeah, it's mindless piffle, but it was hair rock taken to the extreme. Did I like them then? No way. Maybe I'm getting old and long for the 80's, because I'll play them every now and then when I'm thinking about all those high school girls that looked just like them. For nostalgia, they're better now than they were then."
4,Poison's debut album,"Great debut album re released for the 20th anniversary with bonus tracks. Should've included more demos from that time like 'Rock like a rocker', 'Steal away the night','Razors edge' and 'Ain't sayin nothing'"
2,buyer beware,The sound quality of this supposed audiofile pressing on 180 gram vinyl is really bad. I could only assume I got a bad pressing. The amazon marketplace store I purchased from will not return my email. I would like to see if a different pressing sounds better or is this just a horrible mastering job. I have other 180 gram vinyl that sounds great.
2,"eh, not the best but it'd do in a pinch","not overly predictable, but an ok mystery novel. nothing too new or different about this story. it's ok. it was recommended by a friend who liked it so it's possible it's just not my kind of thing. maybe somebody who likes light reading better would appreciate it more."
5,Love everything about it!,"Easy to apply, and looks flawless all day long! Doesn't easily rub off onto your hand or clothes!"
4,A little quite but good overall,"Bought for my 10 year old. They have held up reasonably well. Sound quality is good, though maybe a bit quieter than I would prefer."
5,A dream come true,Finally the best of the best are in one tape - A dream come true for the practitioners of traditional Japanese Martial arts
1,"a most bigoted,partial,prejudiced account that ignores truth","as a previous reviewer noted,mr preston ignores such critical facts as the atrocities committed by the so called republicans.my family was an overwhelmingly republican one composed of lawyers,teachers,artists,writers and assorted intellectuals that were basically middle class.i consulted with them as well as many other people who were witnesses and they felt this is a very untruthful account and does no favor to spanish history scholarship.sadly omission of other central and essential facts stains what could have been a contribution alone the lines of hugh thomas who while no franco lover is a more balanced and accurate histarian."
3,Too long and repetitive,"The author takes 750 pages to say (over and over again) that Franco was a conniving power monger. There is almost nothing in the book about Spain or even the Spanish civil war (one of the most fascinating episodes in the 20th century. I rate it at a ""5"" because of the effort the author made to research his topic"
2,Not as great as they seem,"I purchased these for my baby nursery because I live in an apartment, and wanted an easy removal when it is time for us to move out. The instructions sounded simple, and the product sounded ideal. However, I discovered that they are not very easy to adhere to the wall. You really have to wet them, and then hold each figure for several minutes (or mine started peeling off right away). I can't comment on the ease of removal, but considering they were so hard to get to stick, I think that they will be easy to come off. Just be warned that you need time and patience to get these on the wall! Also, shipping from the supplier was more than the cost of the product, and it easily went into a manilla envelope, so it should have been inexpensive."
5,Great Product,I was very satisfied with this product. I realy like the fact that there is a separate volume control. It makes the product that much easier to use.
2,iPyle of junk,"Decent sound, small and convenient to travel but it doesn't charge your iPod while playing. Overall it's not worth it if you ask me. Spend a few extra a get one that charges"
1,Defective unit,"Unpacked the unit, set it up, plugged in my MP3 player and powered it up, and it made a lot of popping noises. Turned if off, checked connections--all good, back on. Popping noises were gone, but only the left speaker was working. The right speaker, not a sound. Turned it back off, re-checked connections--still good, back on and still no sound from the right speaker. As I began folding it up, the right speaker felt like it was very loose and could fall off.On the other hand, after MANY purchases from Amazon, I had an opportunity to go through the online return process. Simple and quick process to print the RMA and label. An A+ for that process."
3,Broke them immediately.,"These broke the first time that I used them, as I turned one speaker the wrong way to unfold it and snapped the plastic connector, causing one speaker to always dangle. That eventually (maybe a month or two) caused the wire connection to come out of place, resulting in a static noise all the time until the wire finally snapped and these became completely unusable. While I had them and they worked, the sound quality was decent all around. If you get these, make sure that you are very careful to unfold them in the correct direction."
1,Terrible works only 20% of the time,I would not purchase this product. It was a gift that sadly cost over $50 and is not worth the sale price of $20. I could not get the product to play my ipod nano most of the time or my iphone. I would unplug and restart then try again. Sometimes it would work but most the time not. Also I could not charge my nano and play it on the speakers which is a big one for me as it was drained within 2 hours. It looks pretty but that's about it in my opinion.
2,"Poor Performance, Blown Speaker after 4 hrs of use","I didn't expect much from this little speaker set. I just needed something mellow for camping etc. I think they lasted roughly 4 hours before one of the speakers blew and only high's could be heard from the unit.The battery life is also poor, too bad it didn't come with rechargeable built in batteries. You will end up replacing the batteries every couple of hours.Sadly... this unit is a Pyle"
2,Easy Listening? Cole Fans Deserve Better,"Oh my goodness what a big disappointment this was for me. Holly went from phenomenal jazz standards to the poppy Dark Dear Heart to this easy listening pap on Romantically Helpless.Helpless about sums up my feeling after listening to this one -- helpless and hopeless as Cole is an awesome talent whose studio producers seem lost in a fog. If you are interested in Cole and love jazz vocalists, buy ""It Happened One Night"" and just skip this one altogether, alas."
2,Sickly sweet,"Why do so many people think EJ is the God-gifted talent he is?Just because he makes some violonish sounds in his guitar? I don't mean to say doing that is easy--hell I can't do it, but does that mean that I need to make my guitar sound like a violin to be classified as a ""genius""?And yeah, that battery thing.....ummm let's see. Wow. Yeah.But hey, there are people who can walk on their hands. That's impressive too isn't it?I don't mean to take away from Mr. Johnson's abilities. I know he has a houseful of them. But there's something supremely hollow about the way he plays guitar because all what he wants to do is create the world's sweetest, most pleasing sound. No edge, no bite, just honey. As does Kenny G."
4,I disagree vehemently with Mr. Buxton...,"The reviews of material by Mr. Buxton tend to be on the rabid side.Sir, If you don't like prog rock, why review it?Johnson is a superb player, but evidently your appreciation of differenttypes of music is absent....I listen to anything from Rachmaninoff to Grand Funk to Wishbone Ash, depending on my mood...that's why we make different types of music available to people...."
4,Finally a live album from EJ!,"I am really really enjoying this album, and it really shows that Eric's reported perfectionism carries over to his live performance. Is there ANYONE who can control his guitar sound better than that? He is a true virtuoso.His cohorts Billy and Chris function as perfect counterpoint and support to his style. These are some excellent players.My only downside on this is that Eric seems almost too medolic and this makes his music very accessible on first listen, but I start to hunger for him to branch out more and challenge his listners more. He has the chops to do anything, I'd like to see him fully test his limits in the future."
4,Blows Vai and Satriani out of the water...,"Eric Johnson should not be in the same category as Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Johnson is a much much better player, and has so much more feeling then the others. And his new album Live and Beyond proves it...it's the best of his career.I tend to think this album is the best album Vai and Satch never did. Eric's soloing is great, the songs are great, and his tone is great. He fails to get the massive and excellent tone Jeff Beck gets, but it's great nonetheless.Eric's gonna be around for a long time...this album proves it."
4,Infectious,"I am an avid metal enthusist and a guitar player of 10 years, when I was about 12 yrs old my guitar teacher gave me a copy of this cd, I listed once and didnt give it much of a chance. 4 years later I decide to pick it up, and wow, I was missing out. This cd is really great, the whole band is super tight and is a great backup for eric johnson who's playing is near flawless on the cd. Zenland really set the tone for the cd, and is a great opener as an instrumental. Great cd!"
4,Even better live,"I didn't like this that much at first; I don't think it really captured the shows as well as it could have. A couple of cuts I was hoping for weren't there, including Malford tearing up ""Tears of a Clown"" the way Janis Joplin might have. But after I got over that, I enjoyed it almost as much as the concert. It's not perfect. I think Eric went with the cleanest performances instead of the best ones, but if so, well, that's who he is! And it's still a very good album. I got this and the G3 Live Album at the same time, and tended to alternate between them, and them alone, for a week. Malford's vocals really work with the blues numbers, an dthe more classic Eric Johnson cuts are just that - classic Eric Johnson. Often understated, but excellent."
5,"Eric, it was worth the wait!","The first time I heard of Eric Johnson was in early 1995. I picked ""Cliffs of Dover"" as the recessional for our backyard wedding in June, 1995. My nephew Brian, an avid guitarist was impressed and he introduced me to more Eric. This past summer, Brian's mom and I have traveled far and wide to hear Eric & the band play from their new release. So often, a recording does not do justice to the live performance but ""Alien Love Child"" definitely lives up to it. It's been a LONG time since I was this excited about an album. The blues feel to it is most impressive and Eric's unique style is evident throughout. A great stand-out is the exceptional Chris Maresh."
1,Not very good...,"Aside from the fact that all the songs run into each other, something I loathe in CDs, the compilation is nothing to write home about. I know, DJ compilations are supposed to run into each other, that is the point, but this one is not well done at all. I like ""Run to You"" and ""Everybody's Free"", and that is about it but they are shorter than the original versions, I feel cheated. It would be nice if the info on the CDs mentioned whether the songs are partitioned or not. I appreciate it when other reviews mention this! I spend a lot of time pressing the ffw button on the remote and am already totally bored with this CD!"
3,Son of Fury,"Sons of Fury was ""pretty"" good. Not sure that I would purchase it again if I had itto do over again. I would rate it between a 2 & 3. Three because I love old moviesand Tyrone Power."
4,Charming and Unassuming,"""Son of Fury"" harkens to the 1930s black and white costume dramas which visually looked like a novel's illustrations come to life. By 1942, that era was over except for this film. The black and white photography contributes significantly to that 1930s feel. Tyrone Power was an okay actor with enormous likeablility and he brings it out strongly in the character of Benjamin Blake. Everyone is first rate with George Sanders in perfect nasty form. The friendship between Power's character and John Carradine's adds significantly to the film. The beautiful Gene Tierney displays wonderful chemistry with Power and brings a naive charm to her island woman. ""Son of Fury"" tells its story in a professional, richly textured and yet lean manner. This movie is high entertainment not to be missed."
5,A true love story,I am 82 years old and this is the first movie I remember seening in 1939.I never forgot how it left me that is why i looked it up.Good acting nice and sweet love story.
4,book,This book came fast and I really like it I think everyone wanting to make candles should get this book./
5,very useful,"This is a great book for beginners. It's true that it's all about paraffin wax, but it will be very useful also for those who prefer soy wax like me"
3,"When they say basic, they mean basic.","This is a great book if you've never read anything about candlemaking previously. I didn't realize it was going to be so 'simple'. It's extremely basic and I found it almost childlike. It's very easy to understand, has good pictures, and would be great if you are a real beginner."
1,Terrible,I sent it back after four uses! The product did not stop my Rottie puppy from pulling and then it fell off! Luckily I had a buckle collar on him so I could get him home safely. Turns out that the buckle on the halter just pulls apart. Don't waste your money.
5,A Grump to Love,"Esbeth Walters is one of the most memorable characters to spring to action on the pages of a mystery, and what a hum-dinger this one is. For someone in her seventies she navigates the speed bumps and hurdles of this case in heroic fashion. She does not brook fools gently, but it is the determined and Machiavellan minds out to thwart her efforts with whom she must contend and do mental combat. A small Texas town with plenty to hide, greed and pride, and not so hidden motives combine for a complex case that is beyond the powers of the local law to unravel. There are plenty of fascinating characters up to no darn good in this compelling yarn, and there's one grump to love."
2,Cassette version different from CD version,"In 1992 I got this on cassette,and although the CD has 15 tracks vs.10 tracks on the tape,the tape has several songs that are not on this CD. Some of the songs not on the CD are rare early NGDB songs where they sound a little like The Association like ""Shadow Dream Songs"".I can't seem to find many of those rare tunes on other NGDB CD's,so I better hang on to my old tape.Why EMI/Liberty didn't include those songs on this CD,along with the bonus tracks the CD has to offer is beyond me. It would have been a great CD with all the songs from both tape & CD."
4,The Entourage Continues to Grow,"Spinner and Haft are still one the run from the invaders and still looking for a safe pot in which they can seek passage back to their home islands but that goal is looking more and more remote because their entourage keeps growing. Refugees keep joining their caravan and the occasional fighting man shows up from time to time as well. That's a good thing because they need all the fighters they can get with the bad guys in pursuit.Having a couple of marine privates become feudal lords is not without its difficulties. This is especially true when their sergeant, long presumed dead, turns up. He naturally feels that the privates are still ""his men"" (they are) but the 7000+ camp followers and men at arms have other ideas on the matter..The series seems no closer to reaching a resolution than after the last book but it is still a series of interest."
4,DEOMONTECH - SERIES,The series is very well written and keeps you wanting more. But I understand the publisher has killed the Series. I think they have made a very big ERROR IN JUDGEMENT.
3,Frustrated to insanity,"As a web design student, I found Painter 6 wow to be fairly difficult to follow. It doesnt do me any good to have examples that make reference to terminology not listed in the index. The step by step examples don't include any of the stock materials I need to replicate the work. I need something simpler than this, I need a Classroom in a Book. I can't understand what the book talks about, and FEW of the other students in my class have had much success either. Please, rewrite a version for college students, before we all drop out of web design!"
3,Old News,"I bought this for my granddaughter about five years ago. Because it pops up on the list of items for review I will try to recall the results.This was not an item that she found particularly useful. However, it worked as advertised. I don't know if this is still available but if it is and you are considering a purchase I would not suggest that you base your decision on this one review. She had other items she found more entertaining and useful. However, to be fair, it did work as it was supposed to do and another reviewer gave it five stars."
5,Mixing Noted artists with Up and Coming Talentt,"Chapter One - Songs Inspired by Literature is not only a wonderful collection of established artists and unknown artists, it is also a CD that raises awareness and funds for the adult literacy epidemic in the United States.The five celebrity artists serve as a nice collection of fine songwriters. Aimee Mann contributed her song ""Ghost World"" which was inspired by Dan Clowes graphic novel of the same name. Grace Slick contributed her classic ""Rejoyce"", Suzanne Vega contributed ""Calypso"", Ray Manzrek (from the Doors for those who can't quite place his name) contributed ""He Can't Come Today"", and the haunting song from Bruce Springsteen ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"".This CD is a great addition to any CD collection. And, as I have discovered, it's good for car trips..."
5,"This will fit all your big rings, no problem!","Buy it and you will not be dissapointed. This fits a lot of rings and will fit all your big rings too. You cant go wrong, no complaints from me."
4,does the job,This is great for my wide band rings! Outside is like a smooth grain black leather - not sure what material is but it looks like leather-ish material. Inside lining is felt and the foam padded slots allow you to put really wide band rings. I just bought my second one this company (Caddy Bay Collection) and am happy. Only complaint is that I wish they gave the option to have delivered to a PO Box as it is very difficult to get my packages via ups. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the quality is just fine but not expensive quality and I feel like it is just a bit over-priced.
4,"Now, I can call myself ""organized"".","I have recently become ""ring insane"" and thought buying tons of rings would somehow make me flashy. I became flashy but also unorganized when I couldn't find any rings because I had them scattered all over the place. That's when this ring box came to the rescue... Not only does it house the larger rings I own, it also is slim enough to be tucked into a drawer. I plan on buying another one as soon as I've filled up the first one - which should be later this month."
5,great,i have two of this holds my rings perfectly. everybody thinks that i sell rings lol but they are all mine great product
4,Very nice,"Very nice ring organizer. The actual box is relatively cheap looking, but it's an excellent organizer for rings.....any size rings. I have quite a few huge rings that I didn't think would fit, but it will hold them, plus thinner rings. Great purchase, very pleased!"
5,Ring jewelry box,The ring box is exactly what I was looking for. I had multiple rings in separate ring boxes and I needed to consolidate them so I could put them all in a safe. I can now grab one box instead of going through several to find the one I want to wear. The qualaity is also very good and what I expected. Thank you for the timely delivery also.
4,nice ring holder,it is nice but I have a couple of bulky rings and they often come out the ring space. other than that it good.
3,Decent,"Decent, but very hard to grip to get open. Also, the slots are too narrow for a few of my rings. Overall, the case is nice, but the lock is cheap, so its really not even necessary. My 8 year old niece could break into it."
3,I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK BUT...,"I'm not reviewing this book but I'm going to comment on the author's essays on MacNeil-Lehrer years ago, some of which I'm sure mirror this volume. One in particular stands out. He mentioned poor white students and how dislocated they seemed to him. They did not know each other, didn't see themselves as a group. They were individuals trying to advance themselves without the benefit of money, connections or affirmative action. Meritocracy was their only hope. I don't think I've ever encountered a minority person who acknowledged this. Being poor and white, I could certainly relate to this."
3,"""A Cultural Review""","Richard Rodriguez's book, Hunger of Memory is an interesting view on the part of Rodriguez about culture. He thoroughly goes through his experiences and his beliefs. It is interesting to read how Rodriguez believes that his past Mexican culture no longer plays an important role for him. This is unfortunate to hear because I believe that culture is important in building an identity for an individual."
5,BiLingualology,"Richard, never calls himself Ricardo, shares his ""fictional"" family life and his growing up years as a youth in catholic school. The reader sees into the study habits of a middle class spanish speaking child who is shy to learn english and become educated. This reader wonders if Richard the Minority Student was just passed along with good grades, all the way to his PhD degree. Everywhere he studies, he is the token brown/chicano minority student. He doesnt realize it until he is in Grad School. Richard has a way with words, that held my interest. I have started reading Days of Obligation. It is an enjoyable read that offers insight into the life of the brown student in middle class white america."
4,Open and honest view of Richard's public and private life.,Richard Rodriguez draws the reader into his life as a non-English speaking Mexican trying to cope in American society. The early depictions of his childhood fears caused by the nuns who intimidated him are vivid and endearing. He doesn't fail to state his views on bi-lingual education as well as affrimative action. He is poignant in illustrating his opinions on these issues. He is no longer afraid to speak out on situations that irritate him. Thumbs up to Mr. Rodriguez.
1,Why this book is not worth the price,This book has got to be one of the most random books I have ever read. Maybe you would enjoy this book if you are going into a new world but otherwise do yourself the favor and don't pay for this book! The thoughts are some of the most random books ever. DON'T BUY THIS!
1,I feel justified in my actions,This book was the worst piece of garbage I have ever had the misfortune to read. I cut it in half and threw it away after reading it to make sure nobody else in my house stumbled across it and started to read it.
1,This book is terrible,"There is absolutely nothing impressive or interesting in this book. Rodriguez relates to us the story of a boy who rejected the traditionally held values of his family, yet failed to assimilate into the dominant society. It should therefore be very uninteresting that he was a successful student because people who do not assimilate well, are likely to excel in school because they have less distractions."
2,"bad, bad, and bad","although this book has some potential, it is such a slow boring read, that the actual message is over looked!"
1,Tio Tomas,"Richard shed himself to become a white man. He defines himself by the success standards set by white people. Although I don't disagree with him on everything, he clearly has been white washed and it's really sad. HE rants about himself like his 'ethnic' look is so mesmerizing to people. He's got a big head that I really can't empathize with. He made a choice many people of color make, assimilation in most extreme way. If you need a reason to feel pride in your cultural, read this book and see how you cold turn out if you have no pride in your culture"
1,"Whine, whine, whine","I read this book as a part of a college class on marginalized/minority writers. Out of a class of eight, I and another girl both thought this fellow was an unmitigated whiner and the book was terrible. The rest of the class thought it was compelling and thought provoking (or else they just wanted a good grade that week.) It seems to me that it is almost forbidden to express dislike of a minority writer in a classroom environment these days for fear of being branded a racist. I did not like this book. I was in the minority--read it and decide for yourself."
1,make it stop...,"This book could possibly be interesting for minority students, but for anyone else, it is boring beyond belief. His writing style makes me want to find his thesorus and burn it. While he has mastered the art of attempting to make the whole world pity his life, he has completely lost the art of writing a book to be read for enjoyment.I want this book burned. It is a symptom of our overly PC society that an upper middle-class white girl is supposed to read this books and be ""uplifted"" by it. I find it drivel."
3,A must read for all 1st generation American immigrants,"Immigrants from all races can relate to Rodriguez's experience. Being an immigrant myself and growing up during my teen years in melting pot Los Angeles, my experiences were in most cases similar to the author. The book reveals the personal issues he had to face with becoming an assimilated educated Mexican-American and losing his native cultural identity and how it affected his relationship with his family. However he neglects to mention what most immigrants had to face with, racism. Reading this book helped me to deal with my own personal issues with regards to assimilation, race, and family."
3,Assigned in a class- pretty interesting,I read this for a class on autobiographies that I took. I think this was a pretty good autobiography; pretty straightforward and no nonsense. Most of what he wrote was interesting but sometimes I got bored; it was a mixed bag. I don't want to say anyone has an uninteresting life but sometimes I felt there were parts that I wasn't really into. That's just my opinion though.
2,not particularly interesting to me,"I believe that this book was not meant for all audiences. I for one did not care for the book. It did not apply to me as a book like this should. In my opinion, I could not get past the fact that he was whining throughout the book. He makes it sound as though he is the only one in this world that had any problems growing up. Although some of us cannot relate to his personal experiences we do have our own problems. I am not totally disregarding his book, it may apply to a lot of people, I just believe that the book does not hit any nerves in me."
1,fact or fiction,A reader- This book doses not really apply to people who had been 3rd or 4th generation Americans. This book on a boy becoming a man of middle America is told in so many ways that one more in the pool of stories about something that doses not matter to the majority of people. It has good bases story and content but to read it for more then it is worth is not logical. Should be taken as a fictional story about an ideal and nothing more.
1,"Overwritten, self-hating tripe","If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic!"
