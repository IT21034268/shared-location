2,Not that great!,"Mr. Maltin's reviews are limited to what he likes or dislikes. The book is not complete, lots of movies are left out. The list of actors in the back is not complete. He leaves out a lot of people. I have read Movie Guides that are much better and more informative than this one."
2,Leonard Maltin's movie guide,"I'm disappointed in the movie guide since it doesn't have a guide to the old movies. I think he should put one out that's of the old movies, separately, also do another guide for the later movies."
3,"""OK"" compendium","While what is included in this edition of my favorite quick reference film guide is impressive, I was disappointed by what's still not included. There are movies readilly available (from Amazon) on dvd that are omitted while there are many out-of-print titles still listed."
4,Another Great Edition,"This is the best of the movies on tv books published. I agree with the reviews in this book more than any other. Reviews are also updated which I don't believe other books do. There are now two editions, a classic movie guide that covers moveis made before 1960, and the main movie edition.This had to be done because they were running out of room, and some titles had been deleted to save space. Many older movies are now only in the classic edition.. This was done so that they could expand the number of reviews of older films. Both editions are a necessity for any film buff. My only complaint is that some movies made after 1960 that were deleted to conserve space have not been put back in the main edition."
3,One Over Par,"I ordered this book hoping it would be to Sam Snead what ""Ben Hogan: An American Life"" was to Ben Hogan and ""Grand Slam"" was to Bobby Jones. Unfortunately, it's clearly not in the same flight as those two exceptional biographies. While there are some spectacular photos that capture the brilliance of Snead's wondrous swing, the quality of the writing and scholarship does not quite make the cut."
3,The big problem is delivery,"The magazine itself is the classic Italian puzzle magazine, but the delivery to the U.S. is unreliable--it runs routinely 2 weeks behind, and can go as much as a month before two or three issues show up together."
4,His 2nd Best Album,"Besides Breakaway (which is terrific) this is the only Art Garfunkel album that has consistently quality material. Every song here is good with several that are really great including, Since I Don't Have You, Sail On A Rainbow, Miss You Nights, Bright Eyes, Beyond The Tears, Oh How Happy and When Someone Doesn't Want You. Highly recommended (along with Breakaway) - with any of his other solos albums you are taking a HUGE risk!!"
4,Wonderful,Lots of lovely little baby patterns. Great for beginner as well as experienced knitters. I would have preferred more charts and schematic drawings as well. All instructions are written. Still not disappointed at all.
5,Gorgeous book,"This is a beautiful book with fantastic photos. The baby knits are absolutely elegant and NOT ""knitty"" or tacky. A great gift knitting book. The instructions are a bit simplified so they're not the best for a beginner knitter. Highly recommend."
2,Needs full pictures or diagrams of projects. Desperately.,"I returned this book because of the lack of adequate pictures of the projects and complete lack of diagrams. For example, there is a baby shawl pattern, but the only visual of the completed object is wrapped around a baby. How am I supposed to knit a shawl (or decide I want to knit it) if I don't know whether it is a triangle, square, or circular shawl? There is no hint in the book! Numerous other projects in the book have the same problem: cute, arty pictures of babies wearing and using the finished product, but no helpful pictures or drawings that show how to construct the project. If you are loking for a coffee table knitting book, this one is fine, but if you are looking for clear easy to follow instructions, do not buy this book."
4,Cute projects with incomplete instructions,"This book has some great projects in it, and I'm certainly glad that I bought it, but both of the patterns I've followed from here (hooded sweater and stuffed rabbit) have been confusing in parts. I fumbled through on both of them and they both came out very cute, but I'm pretty sure they're different from what Debbie Bliss intended, and I can't figure out if the instructions are outright wrong, or just unclear. (I've checked the errata page on her website, and neither of these patterns are referred to.)"
2,Not worth the price,"I wanted protection for my iPod for when I throw it in my purse. This case looks ok. It feels like rubber though, not very pleasant. Also, this product claims to to thin enough that you can still plug it your iPod in other products (speakers, radio connection, etc), but it's just not true. This case is not THAT thin and your iPod won't fit unless you remove the case. Plus, the case is really hard to put on/take off, so that's not an option. The screen protector is just this thin piece of plastic that doesn't stick or stay on the screen, it won't protect your screen at all."
1,Garbage Media,Stay away from this brand of DVD media. They are beyond sub standard.The quality of playback is unacceptably poor. They skip and freeze constantly. Pay the extra cash and buy quality!!
2,so-so,my experience wasn't good with this one. I tried to make dvd copies but all failed...no success. However it good to burn data files on to it.
1,Money down the drain,"First off, for the record, both... both of my burners support these Ridata Double Layer DVD-R 4X discs (format) and I do have all the necessary/up-to-date CODECS. My burn application is VSO's ConvertXtoDVD, and it is up-to-date.For years, I used Verbatim's DVD+R DL discs and I never encountered a single error.I do have the necessary skill/experience to properly burn video (avi, mkv, mp4, etc.) to DVD media.Now, my problem is that only 1-in-5 of the Ridata discs will accept the burn without errors. Why... I do not know.I guess I have only myself to blame for switching to Ridata. Want a ""clean burn"" on a Double Layer disc, think Verbatim. I know I will in the future."
2,Doesn't work with my Toshiba Tivo.,I am hoping they will work for my son's computer since they won't work for recording on my Tivo. They arrived in good condition. Rating is only because they don't work in the machine I need them for. Nothing wrong as far as I know otherwise. Arrived promptly.
1,Absolutely Worthless!,"Money flushed down the drain. Do yourself a favor, and if you need DVD-R DL, get the Verbatim 3 pack. Verbatim may be more $$, but they work."
3,Hi density DVD-R,"I purchased this product because I had an 8 Gigabyte DVD that I wanted to make a copy of. I made an image file of it on my hard drive and then burned a copy of that image to the disk. This eliminates a lot of errors when you have to swap disks out or have enough memory to make a copy of a large image.These disks basically work, the problem is that one out of every 5 (on average) fails. That means that out of 25 disks, you only get 20 usable disks. I am using an XPS-M1530 (Dell) with Vista 64, 4Gigabyte of RAM, a T-93 Dual Core Processor running at 2.5 GHZ with a TEAC DVD Drive.The video copies that I made that completed the burn process are excellent! My only issue is the failure rate on the disks. When you look closely at the failed disks, there is a discolored area that almost looks like a chip in the edge of disk. No breakage on the actual plastic, but the ink layer looks damaged.If you need 25 disks for a project, buy TWO packages to ensure you wind up with the 25 you need!!!"
5,Border Storage,"Let's just say this is a classroom staple. I assistant teach and we all know how those classroom closets are too small not enough storage. Well, when I searched online and came upon these. I told my teacher we have to order these to store all our unruly borders. They are just what the doctor ordered exactly the perfect product,and now our closet is not an accident waiting to happen. Love these would recommend to all teachers everywhere!!!!"
4,POWERBACK GTO5200C-WK-1,"The PowerBack GTO5200C by DeVilbiss,I found to be strong &reliable; generator. The gasoline capacity allows for extended hours of operation .Directions for safe operation are posted on the generator,step-by-step including leveling of the generatorWith the correct power cords especially those for 3-Pole 4-wire Grounding twist 30A-125/250V circuit.Additionally there are four 125volt circuits.Manuals for this generator must be read & this generator must be grounded for safety.Units are shipped with no oil according to DOT Motor Freight regulation, oil for 10HP Tecumseh Engine is provided by manufacturer as a first step.Voltage /amps are consistant with Manual ,operator should review the load draw from connected appliances...Very Reliable unit during a extended power outageBob F"
1,Noisy as could be and backfires like mad,This is a lousy generator. I was using it to power my coffee vending machines at an art fair and they asked me to leave. They even refunded my $125.00 vender fee just to get rid of me because the generator was making so much noise that people were compalining.
1,Don't Buy This Generator,"Lasted 3 hours before the generator stalled and electrical problems. Key parts, the stator and rotor burned up and are no longer available. You will be left with a $600 Tecumseh 10 hp engine."
4,Great machine for the money.,"I bought my machine from a guy who has to keep up with the Jones's. He bought a new Kubota brand, and I bought his Devilbiss. The machine works great! Only once, it wouldn't start, but I drained the old fuel, put in fresh gas, and it started right up. Pro's - It is a great machine for the money. Con's - It is a little on the noisy side, and a little too heavy to be called portable."
3,Companion 5250w generator,"I bought this generator just before Y2K used it a couple times when I got it, Camping and for building a storage unit. a friend borrowed it around 2007 and told me the plastic gas tank was leaking around the seam. I checked on the price of a new tank $144 at sears. (I'm only filling it half way up now). We had a power outage from a snow storm (11-9-11) got home, tried starting it for the first time since 2007, pulled and pulled and couldnt get it to start, when I was ready to give up my wife reminded me to turn the gas valve on under the tank...guess what? started on the second pull! our power is expected to be out for 2 days. glad I got it! its worth its weight in gold. the temperature is around 21 degrees. on the down side it sure is a loud generator even when it was new. Im going to the hardware store this morning to see if I can find something to quite it down."
2,Less than expected,"The editorial reviews led me to believe that this book would have a wealth of information on technique and tactics, with examples of how they were applied by boxing greats. Instead, the information was very basic."
2,I can't believe I bought this book...,"The information is so basic, it's a waste of time. It only gives about5 drills. Basically, if you know what a push-up, sit-up, and pull-up are, andthat you should lead with a stiff jab, you already know most of what they'll teach you. I gave it two stars, because if you have never seen or heard of boxing this may be enlightening. Otherwise, steer clear. Oh, yeah, the grammar is terrible. I caught at least 8 incomplete sentences, and there is no coherence to the discussion at all."
5,Absolutely fantastic,"Damn.... This book was great. Totally and completely heart-wrenching, moments of absolute agony, but the needed and predictable triumph at the end made it worth it."
2,A difficult story to relate to.,Istopped reading this book when it got to the teerrible way that Maura was treated when she arrived in the US. It was very difficult to read the gory details of her treatment by terrible men. I could not complete it. I hope it had a happy ending but I can't see how it could. Sorry.
3,Soap Opera,Easy read for a slow day. Very predictable. Does shed some light on the Irish immigrant experience. Not up to his usual standards.
1,not to great for homeschool!,"This book started off ok but as the lessons got harder there weren't enough examples or enough explaining of the problems. I compared the way they outlined there steps to another book and on some math skills they seemed to skip some steps. I don't know, I am the type that needs step by step for hard problems & this book didn't give us that. I ended up buying another type of book......this is the student book, i purchased but my review is based on the teacher book I purchased on another site."
4,algebra,"Please advise if this book has been translated into Chinese, I will be very interested if you have Chinese version of this book, please advise."
3,"Works like its supposed to, but...","This product works like it says it does, except that I found it really hard to get a thin coat of paint over it and have a smooth surface. By the time I got a smooth surface, which included a lot of sanding, I had gone through about four coats of paint. The extra paint weakened the strength of the magnetic paint and weaker magnets were no longer usable on the surface."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this video for a friend, who is a huge Lombardi fan.He was extremely disappointed with the content."
5,Guitar To The Max!,"I was one of the lucky ones to see Frank do his thing live, shortly after this title was released. All I can say is get this, and get it quick. All Along The Watchtower is alone worth the cost. If you haven't heard Frank's version, you haven't heard the song. There's great guitar work throughout, and this will definitely challenge anyone who might try to learn his riffs. Do yourself a favor and buy this one!"
5,It's a Rainbolt of Baseball Legends,"Baseball Homerun Hitters is about the best the homerun hitters in baseball.Just to name a few,Lou Gehric,Babe Ruth,Roger Maris,Hank Aaron,Willie Mays etc.It talks about their life and their baseball carrers.I recomend you read about Mickey Mantle he is also in this book.This is a great book."
4,The Sensitivity of the Spirit,"Perhaps a better way to look at it, is that we have been working on such a loving relationship with Jesus and are trying to immitate His Character Traits and when we stray from this path or sin we disconnect or put other things in the way. They have always been the same for all times. We hopefully are the ones getting better and better. There is also another thought, that sometimes God places adversity in our path and we in the beginning of this process think that it is bad. But this is just his way of making us stronger and shaping us the way that He wants us. At this period, we see and feel things that we don't ordinally have seen or felt before. This phase stops, not because we have done somethings wrong, but because we now understand what He wants us to do. (Kind of like a gentle push)"
5,Beyond our head to our spirit to God's Spirit,I have preached and studied the subject of the Holy Spirit for many years and Kendall's book has touched a very important area that has been neglected concerning the Holy Spirit. We are too insensitive to the Holy Spirit and His work in our hearts and world
3,Just an okay book.,There were some good points in this book but some of the analogies were referred to over and over again making them redundant. He made way too much of comparing the dove & the pigeon. The best thing that I got from the book was about how not to grieve the Holy Spirit.
5,LIFE-changer!...still reaping benefits after 4 1/2 years.....,"First heard Dr.Kendall discussing this book and its most powerful spiritual analogy when being interviewed by Dr. James Dobson on 5/22/2008. Three days later the Holy Spirit put a giant exclamation point on this by sending a dove then a pigeon to me (literally, as I am a veterinarian)...not enough space here to share but if you'd like to hear about my experience with this book and these birds I'll e-mail you my short story (request at w.salter@charter.net). Order Dr. K's book- I promise you'll be blessed and changed by it. Enjoy His Peace!!!"
5,Excellent,"I received this item with in a few days, it was packaged good and came in one peace. The record from what I could tell was not scratched."
3,I Expected more.,This book showed me some solutions but I must say that the first part was just so so. I don't believe in chacras or things like that. But the other half was helpful and opened my eyes a little bit.
3,cool ska but not the rockin' mad the mopeds from usa,"These mopeds are good rockin' fellows and the tracks are good but they are not the mopeds of legend.. No my darlings, they cannot compare to the bruteish intelligence of the ""real"" mopeds also known as the mopes. The Mopeds, an electric duo from the east coast usa (not the uk) broke up in 1987 and blasted crazy punk rotten psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast. You can checkout a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3's( www.themopes.com ) Compare for yourself. The old dive bar broken down shaman heroes or these newer ska-men?"
2,Poor Quality Rendition of Newton's Masterpiece,"I can hardly believe Hawking lent his credibility to this edition. Although his motivation of getting people to read classics is great, this edition barely contains any Hawking commentary, is riddled with errors and omissions, and fell apart after just a couple of months of use. Buy the Green Lion or the big Blue edition instead!"
5,Just Excellent,"I didn't expect much from the Rally Cordless Spotlight, considering the great price. I figure you usually get what you pay for. In this case, I think I've gotten much more. It worked right out of the box and it holds a charge for quite a while. I can't say I've done any scientific testing of its brightness or battery charge holding ability or anything, but I am very pleased with its performance."
2,Could not use it,"The shipping was good, but the bar that slides on the clamp did not have holes drilled, so i could not put it together and use. Im currently deployed in Iraq and tools are a little hard to come by, otherwise I would have drilled it myself. It now sits in the box awaiting my return home. Bottom line, poor craftsmanship."
2,doesn't work well without shoes,"Maybe it's just me, but I found this next to useless if you aren't wearing shoes. As you can tell from the picture, the footbar can be secured in one of three positions over your feet. However if you're in bare feet or don't wear your shoes indoor like in my house, I found that even the lowest setting is still too ""high,"" meaning it is still too far away from the door/floor and doesn't hold your feet down firmly at all. I tried using it a few times and have gone back to just sticking my toes under the couch."
5,"Lalo, Saint-Saens: Cello Concertos Yo-Yo MA",Thank you for having this selection available. Ordering somethingthis specific through Amazon saves me a lot of time and energy.
5,Amazing tool,"Worth every penny, see that ugly stack of cards by your keyboard you have been meaning to get rid of for a month. Alittle time and they are gone! As it states, I recommend checking manually each card before accepting. A great tool, only minor complaint is interns generally use the old pc and making sure they have the usb connection is necessary."
4,Why didn't I get it sooner?,"This is an excellent product - easy to set up and very stable; the instructions were straight forward and simple. I had accumulated nearly 1,000 business cards and never got round to entering all of them on my PDA (a Psion 5) or in my Lotus Notes name and address book. Two evening's scanning with the CardScan had them all on board and a quick synchronisation to my PDA completed the job. My only major complaint is that there is no ""find and replace"" facility to alter telephone codes or make company name changes etc.[...] I have now parted company with my aging Psion 5 and am using the Nokia Communicator. Even with an upgrade to the V6 software, Corex appear to be totally US centric and does not support Symbian (just Palm) so the only way to update my Communicator is to synchronise CardScan with Lotus Notes, then Lotus Notes with the Symbian based Communicator; a convoluted exercise. It's still a great device though - but it could be outstanding..."
5,This thing is great,"The Corex Card Scanner is a must for anyone going to a trade show or conference where you might come home with an unmanageable number of new contacts' business cards. Everything about the setup was a piece of cake, even on Windows 2000. Hardware connects with a USB connection and all was up and running in minutes. Once set up, you just slip a card into the scanner and watch it convert the graphic information to text. You do have to be careful in this process as the character recognition is not perfect and will often mistitle a field or just read the data incorrectly, but overall, quite accurate. When you verify the information as correct, it keeps the card in the desktop program, both graphically and in labeled text fields. From there, you can seamlessly trasfer data to other programs (including Outlook) with the click of a button. I don't know how I lived without this."
3,Can be much improved... but good idea,"The scanner was larger than I expected and is flimsy with a bulky adaptor. The main problem is software; it's buggy, not intuitive (Ctr-X is ""cut"" and ""Ctr-V"" is ""paste""), it is also slow to load the database once you get to about 200 cards. On my NT, some screens did not display properly. Set up of sync with Outlook was way too complicated; it is also not possible to sync with Outlook AND Palm; you have to chose one or the other. I have to sync with Outlook first and then with Palm. On balance, the product is helpful and it does save time, but it can be much much improved from here. I recommend it to those with hundreds of biz cards like me but do not expect too much."
5,Dope backpack,"Met all of my expectations and looks sick! Like I'm not wearing anything, even on my fixie. Would def recommend to others."
1,My favorite James Wood book!,"I have already read three books by James Wood and I have to say that this one is my favorite. This collection contains his reviews of the novel ""White Teeth"", perhaps his most famous review; his review of Dostoyevsky's biography (""Dostoyevsky's God""); and the really mirthful review of a Tom Wolfe novel (""On Tom Wolfe's Shallowness""), which really made me laugh out loud; and many more. I always find myself returning time and again to these reviews just for the sheer joy of immersing myself into James Wood's beautiful prose, acute observations, and gracious style of literary criticism. Unfortunately, this Kindle edition contains lots of typographical errors. Don't they ever use spell check?"
3,Who knows,I still don't know why children don't listen. I get a sense of it but I find it extremely difficult reading the antrophosofical way. To me it is just beyond my understanding. I just understand more reading real life situations. So this book was not for me. I'm sure someone that is more understanding with the right mind or understands the'Steiner' approach will do a lot better. I just can't concentrate on 'theory' and tried really hard reading sentences over and over again. So as of today i still would like to know why children don't listen.
2,Really average book,"I had to use this book for a graduate educational assessment course. The book uses a lot of doublespeak and circular language. It also seems to be woefully short on examples. Several chapters need supporting discussion of the topic (i.e. Chapter 5 Generalizability theory would benefit from a discussion (or at least a comparison) on Classical Test Theory). Although, I believe the creation of accurate, reliable, and consistent measurements is imperative, this book is more geared for scientific creation of assessments than it is for high school testing."
5,Awesome chairs and unbelievable price,"We love these chairs! We have been looking and didn't want to spend 1000 dollars just for one chair. We ended up buying 4 chairs and the sofa. The look great around our pool and all our friends rave, about them. We had seen some chairs from frontgate and these were just as good, but at a fraction of the cost."
5,Hard to beat value,"This chair is stylish and comfortable. It's hard to tell what the wicker is made of, which DOES NOT look like plastic (even though I suspect it is). The wicker is smooth and looks high quality. The cushion is firm and deep. We've had it a while now and it's stood up to rough treatment from our kids. Delivery was unexpectedly quick, within ten days."
2,"love the chairs, hate the cushions!","i bought 4 arm chairs, and 2 end tables. i wanted the coffee table as well, but it is apparently out of stock, with no date of re-stocking. i love the lines and the look of the chairs, but the cushions have completely mildewed, and i can't get them clean. i thought i could leave them out, because i thought they were waterproof. they are not! any ideas on how to clean them? i am afraid to bleach them since the fabric is already fairly thin."
5,Great design and comfortable,We got 4 of these right before the 4th to go around our firepit.We have since bought coordinating pillows for the back as for sitting a while around the fire at night it helps to have the lumbar support. Seats are nice and wide and quality seems to be excellent. They really look nice on our flagstone patio and we have received alot of compliments.
5,Affordable quality,"I have the whole line and love it. I did replace the cushions with ones that are thicker and made for outdoors, and the price is still better. Well made quality."
3,Are you expecting to get more chairs in?,"My friend has this item and I love it. I went online to try to buy it and it's out of stock as it was when my friend bought her's. Are you expecting to get more in? As I mentioned it's a really nice chair, but I wouldn't buy the couch and table without the chair - I'm looking for a complete set."
5,Wow!,"After listening to this it truly seems as though these guys have serious intent on conquering the metal world! (literally). I absolutely loved their first release 'Glory Thy Name' and I like this one just a touch more! That's really saying something considering how great their first cd was.This is fast powerful epic sounding melodic metal that has GREAT vocal harmonies and tasteful extreme vocals at times. Lots of orchestral parts going along with the blistering (yet melodic) guitars and quite simply these guys have their own formula for creating true masterpieces.With this release I easily place this band right at the top along with bands like Kamelot, Pagan's mind, Rhapsody etc.... Only this band is not a copy of them at all as Divinefire has it's own sound but no one can convince me that this band is not as good as the above mentioned bands! Divinefire has claimed their right to join the utmost top position now.Enough said."
5,mass metal mayhem,I just got this with the Glory Thy Name album by these guys and they are killer metal albums. Read my review of the GTN album and then apply it to this album. They are both awesome and deserve more recognition.
2,well well well,"Well I know that there trying to send a good message but their music is prety lame. They get 2 stars becalse of the message their trying to send. Onto the actual music its self, its Black Metal nock off. And they do a really poor job at it. Sorry to those people who like it. But this is only one persons opinion."
3,"Interesting History, Passable Hiking Info","The Swell is a great place for exploring interesting slot canyons difficult and easy. This guide has a very good history section, but is a little weak on the hiking info. Why do I say this? Because Kelsey's information is not always accurate - he often makes a few guesses, underestimates difficulties or distances, and sometimes just gets things a little confused. Steve Allen's 'Canyoneering' is a much better primary source, and this makes a good secondary source."
1,"Bad maps, bad estimates, but good pictures","I talked with a park ranger who made the comment, ""We use Steve Alan's book to find all the people who get lost from Kelsey's descriptions."" I didn't believe this until I went down to the Swell and did the Virgin Spring hike described in Kelsey's book. He said that he did the hike in 9 hours. Using GPS I would estimate the hike at just about 30 miles total. Steve Allen recommends 2-3 days to complete the same hike. Kelsey's descriptions of this complicated hike are dangerous and sure to leave you searching for hours for the trail in a place where getting lost is easy because of infrequent use. He also puts a large disclaimer in this book ""Don't blame me"" because someone blamed him for getting lost on the local news. The only thing good about Kelsey's book are few good pictures. Save your money and buy Steve Allen's book."
4,A great guide for all skill levels,"I've used this books for years, and Kelsey's descriptions and maps are fairly well done. Sometimes he underestimates the difficulties of hikes, but if you're going to the Swell, this is the book you want."
3,Clipper Add-ons,"I brought this item assuming it would work with my Andis Clipper; however, it does not fit into them. I brought a trimmer, so I guess these are supposed to be used for regular attachments on other Andis products. Therefore, I can not really say how good they are. I wished Amazon did not recommend this to me when purchasing my item, or else I would have not purchased this item."
4,Not for Andis AGC 2 speed,"I bought these for my Andis AGC 2 speed clipper. They are too small. It says on the back of the package that it fits ML, GC and MBA. I bought them from a site that didn't state this fact. They are quite rugged and have a metal clip that attaches the comb to the clipper. It appears that it would hold VERY well."
1,Does not work with T-Outliner,"This item does not work with the Andis T-Outliner - Amazon are entirely misleading customers by saying that they are frequently bought together as clearly it indictes that they are the correct attachments. Also as a previous reviewer pointed out, the product is dispatched from a different company than listed - they are sent from BEAUTY4FAMILY not HOUSEWARES as listed - I would not recommend anyone to do business with either of these companies as they simply ignore any communication when there is a problem with the order."
3,andis clipper combs,the product is nothing special.. it does exactly what the combs are supposed to do. It is definitely a necessity.. The tips are kind of sharp against the scalp.
4,Sturdy,The attachments are made well and can be used for a long time. The don't break easily like the Speed-O-Guides.
1,Andis Detachable Clipper combs,This product did not fit model of electric clipper which was ordered.It was returned but I have not being reimbursed or offered the adequate model!!
3,not the best guards for the master clipper,"if your planning on getting guards for your master or fade master just buy the magnetic guards, the purple ones because these clips can fail over time and the material is pretty weak ,i dropped my 1/16 guard a couple times and it broke within like 2 weeks ,same with my 1/8 .. with the magnetic guards they are strong and durable so i recomend you just pass on these"
1,Trimmer combs,I have two Andis clippers and these combs fit neither.I also purchased these from the previous seller who is not responding to e-mails.
4,Andis Clipper Combs,"Plastic is cheap moulding. Fits Andis 1557 Professional clippers. Sizes are standard (inches) and not ""#'s. A little confusing when I went to look for the ""#2"" attachment. Then again, I'm no professional."
1,Trimmer Combs,"I thought the combs, sold by a different manufacturer, would work with my Andis trimmer - not even close! The combs were a total waste of money and not worth the cost of returning."
3,PHILIP JOHNSON'S POLITICS AND CYNICAL SURVIVAL,"Philip Johnson was an active propagandist for the Nazi government and active fascist sympathizer, who had tried to implement fascism in USA for at least 8 years between 1932 and 1940. Details of this past are described in ""WE CANNOT NOT KNOW HISTORY:"" PHILIP JOHNSON'S POLITICS AND CYNICAL SURVIVAL by KAZYS VARNELIS in Journal of Architectural Education, November 1994 published also on the Internet, and also discussed at http://arch.designcommunity.com/viewtopic.php?t=3709."
2,Lenmar Battery for Toshiba PDA,"I received this battery and the back panel fell off. I sent this battery back to amazon for an exchange, which I promptly received. The replacement battery however had the same problem with the back cover falling off. Apparently the glue batch does not hold well and when this happens, the battery will not work properly, since there is a contact (negative, I believe). I used glue to make it work again. I feel the manufacturer of this battery should use better glue material so the back panel does not fall off.I recommend this battery if you have glue available to fix this problem."
1,Wobbly & Cheap,This mic stand seems very cheaply made. Right out of the box it couldn't even properly hold up a mic at certain angles. The whole thing seemed really wobbly. We're taking it back to the store.
4,Great story,"I really enjoyed this book because I liked the change of pace for the story line. I loved the Captain's personality and Jacinda's as well. Mystery, murder, romance, this one has it all!"
2,"Not enough drill for a serious home repair person,","I bought this after Christmas and was snagged by the price. Only Craftman comes close to this price for a 12v.I needed to drill and torque down a banister. After charging both batteries (over 6 hours for both). I started on the project but the drill lacked the needed torque for the lag bolts and the batteries were quickly depleted and needed another charage.The real issue of a serious drill is torque and ""Durability"" of the battery(s)... With this B&D the battery charge took a very long time and then the batteries were not, using the definition for ""durable"" > ""able to exist for a long time without significant deterioration"".IF you are a serious a serious home repair person spend the extra [price] and move up to B&D 14.4volt Firestorm Drill - both torque and battery durablity will be significantly better."
1,Don't Buy Firestorm!,"Listen to the other reviews, please! Firestorm is a waste of money! I sold tools at Sears for three years and I have never had a satisfied customer. O.k., if you are drilling 1/8"" holes or driving 1"" screws, you won't have a problem. But you don't need an 18V drill to do that.This drill only has 125 in/lbs. of torque. The new Craftsman 12V with a Diehard battery has over 300 in/lbs. of torque. Plus it is $20 cheaper at normal price.While I worked at Sears, I am not a fan of Craftsman cordless tools. I much prefer Milwaukee, DeWalt, or Makita. However, any Craftsman cordless drill is better than any Firestorm POS. Do a little research, go into the stores and play with these things. Find a tool you like using, not just one that is cheap."
1,Poorly made,"I can attest to the low-power issues of this electric drill. It has a difficult time generating the force needed for many jobs.My biggest beef, however, is that after only 2 years, both battery packs are literally falling apart.The replacement packs run in the 40-50$ range, and since you need 2 (one to use while the other charges) that means that you are paying 100$ each time you must replace them. This smacks of planned obselescence to me.I will definitely be thinking twice before purchasing another B&D; tool."
2,Xmas scam,Not a bad drill and screw driver for light household tasks. The problem comes when the batteries need replacing. Few places carry them and those that do charge more than I paid for the drill which was being pushed as a Xmas item. I will now buy a De Walt.
5,flirtin' with greatness,"this just might be the best southern rock album . not the best band as in career. but one single cd, this is it."
5,Excellent cd but not Skynryd,"I dont know how people can say this is just like Skynryd. Skynryd has sappy, over done ballads.Hatchet just purely rocks out with amazing guitars. Im happy that I bought this cd because I loved the song Flirtin with Disaster, and wanted to check this band out more. The cd is well worth the price, and Boogie No More is one of the greatest rock songs ive ever heard. The guitar solo in the middle will have your hand banging, guranteed. I dont know to much of this band, but they deserve more credit then they get."
3,Expanded?,"Isn't an expanded edition supposed do feature EVERYTHING from the earlier edition plus new stuff? Well, where the hell did the lyrics go? Why not include them if they were present on the vinyl and previous CD editions? The live tracks aren't worth the purchase of this CD. If you're a die-hard fan of the band, get it for the one unreleased studio track."
1,"Buen Diseño, Mal Desempeño","Despues de 6 meses de comprar el producto, aparecieron problemas tales como, se apaga solo, el control remoto deja de funcionar, la pantalla se apaga y el reproductor sigue funcionando, a veces no quiere prender. Y todo esto atado al nivel de calor q pueda estar en el carro. En conclusion este reproductor es bueno solo para climas frios donde no pegue sol, y es malo para el resto del mundo."
1,Damage to the last sheet,"The last sheet was glued to the cover, which caused a damage to the sheet when I tried to separate them.I am not happyHarith"
5,Grandson's 6 months of age,I bought this for my grandson and was pleased when I saw the variety and quality of the items included. My daughter and son in law were also delighted as was my grandson.
4,Excellent Advent devotional!,"This is an excellent devotional for the Advent season, even if you don't belong to a denomination that practices Advent (I don't). A little different than most devotionals for Advent, this one runs from Dec. 1-31, right up to the new year.The book is small and easy to carry on the bus or wherever. It includes a ribbon bookmark to keep your place. The pages are think and glossy - this book is built to last over many Christmas seasons! The daily Scriptures are printed in the book, so there is no need to go digging through your Bible unless you want to - there are additional readings for each day that do need to be looked up, but only if you have the inclination.I give it four stars. I don't agree with everything in it, but I would recommend it to everyone. Can I give it 4 1/2 stars? ;)Buy this book! :)"
4,finally food that I can relate to!,"What I really like about this book is the simplicity and the ""all-American"" style of the food. I am not enticed by gourmet food-I just love good eating! The sweet onion smothered hamburgers, herbed garlic bread, raspberry coffee ring, Denver omelets, and four cheese stuffed shells are out of this world and make you wonder if you're really on a diet. There are even recipes for macaroni and cheese, pot roast and pound cake! I am thrilled to attest to the fact that I've lost weight eating these foods. Weight Watchers really got it right with this one."
4,Decent,"Residential grade. Brass finish over zinc. The finish will eventually wear down. It's hollow. Inner mechanism is not as solid as commercial grade and their higher end residential lines. Life expectancy is probably 5-10yrs. But for the price if you are looking for a mid-term solution or don't plan on being in the house forever, or are just flipping a house, these lower cost levers fit the bill.Hope that helps."
3,Bob,"Had the product for six months, no problems. Initial impression was that it was somewhat 'flimsy/light weight' and it is. However it functions as designed and advertised. You will definately have to secure the winder to the patio floor or some sort of solid mounting surface. You may want to drill a couple of drain holes in the interior tray.Winding the hose back is no problem as there is a 'foot step' to hold the winder down but pulling the hose out, if the winder is not secured, it is not heavy enough to stay put."
4,Good,This came almost over night and quickly. The only porblem was there were no washers with it for the hose hook ups and the directions weren't very good. Product is very nice looking and durable.
1,Don't waste your money,I just bought this hose reel based on the reviews to replaced a smaller Suncast hideaway that lasted about 3 years. This one leeks the same place that the older one did before it broke completely. Save your money and don't by the Suncast Brand Hose reels. I am waiting for a response to my e-mail from Suncast
4,smart trak,"works well all summer, but when I put it away for the winter the base broke off. I was able to fix it, but we will see how it does this year"
1,Off Base,"The base would not stay attached to the hose cabinet making it impossible to use the hose reel. When I took it out of the shipping box, the swivel was detached. I put the swivel back on, started to carry it outside and whole base fell off. I could not get the base to securely fit to the cabinet. I think it was due to the plastic tabs not being strong enough to secure the base to the cabinet. Not a quality product - lightweight plastic all around."
4,Hard to wind up but otherwise good,"This product is as advertised and smart trak guide does make it easier to wind up but it is still difficult if you have an over 100ft hose to wind because you have to bend over pretty far to crank the handle, especially if you're tall. If the handle was just a little larger and/or higher it would be much easier. It is all plastic but it still seems to hold up well and it does hold a 150ft hose with no problems. It does not move much after being staked into the ground but when you are rolling the hose it is best to but a foot on it to keep it steady. Other than that decent product for the money"
1,Not So Sure,"The jury is out on this one because my husband got completely frustrated trying to secure the base down with the stakes provided because the holes are so close to the unit you cannot use a hammer to drive them into the ground without scarring up the sides or even being able to hit the darn thing. If your ground is sand maybe it's not a big deal, but with hard ground it's a killer. I've yet to use it because without the stablizer stakes it will move around. Bummer. Seemed like a good idea at the time.UPDATE: THIS PRODUCT BROKE AFTER ONLY 1 YEAR AND A FEW DAYS. Now I am totally dissatisfied."
1,Bad product / bad support,Ours broke after a day. Customer support was difficult but after many frustrating calls we had replacement parts sent. There were no instructions but we eventually got it back together. It broke again a couple days later.
3,Connector disappoints,Cheap plastic connector threads stripped out when attempting to change to a better hose and now connection leaks. Must throw entire unit away now. Waste of money. Will go with a metal or brass hook-up from now on.
1,don't buy it!,"only plastic material, low quality, was broken after using it two times! looks great, idea is great! was great the first time I used it, but the manufacturer once again trying to save money used low quality, low cost plastic, and the engine was dead after the second use! very expensive for what it is! don't buy it!"
5,Hose Reel Cart,"Very pleased with the Suncast hose reel - larger than we thought it would be, very sturdy, like the automatic reel, our old one didn't have this feature and it really works well. It is best to turn off the water and empty the hose before reeling in. Ours is sitting on the edge of a concrete carport not anchored to anything so it doesn't swivel as easily as it would if we had it anchored to the ground or a wooden surface, but that's not a problem at all. Highly recommend."
3,Should have shopped off line-,Paid way too much for a plastic box with a plastic reel inside. Over paid about $30.00 from Amazon and then really feel ripped off by how chintzy it looks. Waiting for housing gestapo to tell me it can't be in front.
3,Neil could do better,"""September Morn"" is perhaps one of Neil Diamond's few low points in his storybook career. There are a few high points here: The sad, yet sentimental title track, the jazzy, euphoric ""Jazz Time"" and the downbeat ""The Good Lord Loves You"". I didn't care for Neil's own version of ""I'm A Believer"", a song that was really made to be an up-tempo number, as the Monkees' version was. ""Stagger Lee"" just wasn't cut out to be an easy listening tune. But, if you are a true Diamond fan, you'll want to add this CD to your collection."
3,"worth it for ""Mama Don't Know"" alone","September Morn has many covers,but the best are the few originals.""Mama Dont Know"" has an intoxicating techno beat and bassline,and Neil doing his ""Brother Love"" preacher thing.Love the big ""Heal Me,Make Me Holy"" chorus.A great song.""That Kind"" is also a great song-a very pretty old-hollywood tale.Kind of like a low key ""Candle in the Wind"".the jazzy remake of ""I'm A Believer"" is well,interesting.the only covers I like are ""The Sun Aint Gonna Shine Anymore""(amazing how melancholy and big-sounding Neil turned this little oldie) and ""The Good Lord Loves You"" (a strong cry for tolerance and peace instead of war).September Morn is uneven though-why cover ""Dancing in the Street"" in 1979?Just sounds lightweight and weak.I always skip the title cut.And the ""Stagger Lee"" cover is a weak way to end this album."
2,Schmaltzy Snooze Songs,"This is Neil once again crooning unbearably schmaltzy stuff that puts me to sleep in an instant. Neil had long ago slid into the comfortable adult-easy-listening-contempary category and thereby ceased to make any interesting and/or exciting music. Go back and listen to ""Cracklin' Rosie"" and then put this on, and you'll get an idea of what I mean. For lovers of ""sap"" only."
5,ABOVE & BEYOND,"The product was shipped timely and carefully. A minor oops with one of the items shipped was immediately taken care of, and customer service was top-notch."
3,Balloonists,Did not realize it was poetry. Quite good actually. I don't usually read poetry. I will stick with historical fiction.
4,A fanastic mystery book by Colin Dexter,"This book is good, yet it is just like any other ordinary mystery book. It has a boring start, but as the story progresses it gets more intense. It starts off like a mystery book. The detective meets with a lady. They get to know each other and later on the lady is found dead in her home. Murder? or Suicide? --The detective is on the search for answers."
4,Brilliant,"This is by far the best Morse book. It contains all of Dexter's classic elements -- Morse's brilliant mind, his drinking, his limited lady skills -- and inserts them into a classic storyline to create a perfect mystery. This is detective fiction at its finest."
5,Inspector Morse is a winner,"As a fan of the Inspector Morse series on television, I thought I would like to see the original story in print. I found Colin Dexter to be an excellent writer and the story and characterization to be outstanding. I plan to read more of this series."
5,If you love the show you'll also love the book,This is a really nice companion book with lots a photographs and dialog from the show. It only covers seasons 1 and 2. If they had continued and done additional books for the rest of the seasons I would have purchased those too.
2,disappointing once over lightly.,"As a WW fan I waited expectantly for what I had thought was a more in depth retelling of my favourite episodes. Instead this rather glossy overdone manuscript runs through the synopsis of each episode with the same brevity which can be found on any West Wing website, and there are a few. The insider narrations of each of the main characters and the actors who portray them are interesting enough but not good enough reason to buy what is in the end only a fan magazine for die hard addicts. Adam Sorkin you can do better than this..."
1,A DISAPPOINTING RE-RELEASE,"For those of you who already own this great recording and are hoping for a polished re-release I have bad news.These recordings have not been re-mastered at all nor have any new queue points been added. Il Tabarro still only has one, only, at the very beginning and Angelica and Schicci both have only two each.It's a shame that Sony chose to re-issue these recordings, unlike EMI and Decca which both re-mastered their old sets, without any kind of improvement over the originals. If you haven't heard these, because they have been out of circulation for a while, please, with my blessing, the casts and the conducting are nearly perfect. Worth it for any fan of Marilyn Horne especially. Her Zia Principessa is, to me, the best ever recorded. But it's ridiculous that Sony put this set out without even adding the traditional queue points...again. It's not like they don't know better. A real shame and a waste of money."
3,I agree,"I can only agree with both previous reviews: Yes, it's a lovely set, yes, the casts and conducting and playing are, mostly very good (I don't like Cotrubas, I never did and never will) Scotto, Domingo, Horne, and others are very good indeed. Especially in Suor Angelica, but also in Tabarro, one can hear that the singers of smaller roles are Brits, with some tell-tale Anglo-Saxon consonants, and occasionally murky vowels, but that hardly detracts from what is a top set, at top value. BUT: Sony, SHAME ON YOU!!!!! To release this without remastering, well, OK, I can let that slip, but without some cue-points, IS RIDICULOUS!!!!! Tabarro is a single block of music, not one cue-point!!! What was the thinking behind this? WAS there thinking behind this?! Very below par, Sony!!!! I still think you should get this since it is a lovely set at a lovely price. Maybe Sony knew this... So five stars for musical content, but NO star to Sony, makes an average of three. Basta!"
1,SONY should be shot,"What is the point of reissuing without cleaning up the set? Also, where are the queues? STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!! They do this on their La Rondine with Te Kanawa and Domingo. Truly annoying..."
3,Get the Kindergarten Version If You Have a Pre-Schooler,"I agree with the other reviewer. If you have a 4-year old who is about to go into (or has already started) pre-school, get the Kindergarten Brain Quest (yellow) deck. While this deck is useful (especially for gearing your little one up the summer before pre-school), you'll find that after once going through the deck, your little one will find that most of the questions are not challenging at all. This deck is almost PRE pre-school. If your 3 1/2 or 4-year-old is somewhat bright, skip this deck and go for the yellow Kindergarten Brain Quest deck."
4,Very Nice...could be more challenging.,"I Bought this after reading many reviews and liked what I got. However, I gave it only 4 stars because I feel it could have been a little more challenging for the age group specified. If the child has gone through the previous brain quest series... they know what to expect and are able to answer it very quickly. To keep them interested and get them to think a bit harder, they could have taken it up a notch."
5,Great product but may be a little easy for a 5 year old,My daughter is 4.5 and this is kind of easy for her. It's still good practice though. If your child is on the brighter side you might want to look at buying the next level they offer.
3,Not a good value,"I bought this for my 3-year-old because we really enjoy the grade-school versions for my 7-year-old and he wanted ""his own."" The questions are really too easy, but more than that, the cards have only 3 questions, and some have only 1. We are almost done with the first deck and it's taken less than two hours, for sure. Meanwhile, my older daughter's decks are still going strong for us after hours and hours of use.I think they could have had some questions without pictures and enhanced the value of the decks. It's still a cute product, but it doesn't have the same value as the other decks."
2,"If your child is 4, get the next level brainquest","My daughter is 4.5 and I thought preschool level would be just right for her, but it's too easy - and she's your average preschooler. Luckily I've got a 3 year old too, and she is enjoying these cards, so it's not a total waste of money. I recommend those for kids under 4-5."
5,Great for standing in line,"I purchased this item to expand my 3 and 4 year olds' minds. Well, they both loved this game. And the best thing I ever did was take it to Disney World with us and played it with the kids while we were standing in lines for the rides. It made the time go so fast, the kids were learning and even the other children standing in line were interested. This year we are going back to Disney and I just purchased the Pre-school and the Kindergarten ones. I am planning on more success standing in long lines with small children. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Just okay.,"I purchased this card set for my daughter (who turned 3 in September) and she is able to answer/complete 99% of the activities on the cards already, thus making the learning purpose of this set pretty much insignificant. While I would like to believe that my daughter is a smarty-pants, I think the cards are simply too easy for preschoolers. I wish I would have purchased the next level of these cards for her instead.On the plus side, I like the durability of the cards and that they are bound together. I think these would be great for idle hands (and minds!) in the car or on a trip."
3,fund and educating,we bought Molly edition for 3-4 and liked it. so bought this one. my son loved it and apparently he flipped through before we started doing the games. i was very surprised to see him answering quickly on some of the questions not that easy for a 3.5 year old
3,OK,"I didn't like this CD as much as Willie alone. I was a little disappointed and think his other CD's are better. I didn't know what to expect so if you like Leon Russell, you will like this CD very much."
4,"This album's a gem,and contains songs unobtainable elsewhere","This one should be in the stable of every Willie Nelson fan. It also features Leon Russell, but he is clearly the sideman on this album. It contains many old sentimental favorites (Autumn Leaves,Danny Boy), haunting torch songs ( Because of You, Stormy Weather), and even western ballads (Don't Fence Me In, Ridin' Down the Canyon). The selection of songs is fantastic. One drawback is the age of the album, which has a channel-to-channel vascillation. One assumes this is to approximate true stereo. I had the eight track of this album years ago, and the CD sounds the same, hence four stars instead of five. But-this minor issue is eclipsed by the talent of Nelson and Russell singing together. Fans of the Stardust album will welcome this collection of twenty songs as an asset to their library. I couldn't imagine not owning a copy."
4,Great People; excellant tunes,"Fine older country standards preformed by two ""old hands"" at the throttle. As for Willie Nelson of course everyone not living in a cave somewhere is well familiar with the myriad of songs he's written and certainly the many he's recorded. Leons reputation should also at least be in the back of any ones mind that's over 30 or so, from his early career through his association with Joe Cocker and still playing that backyard size piano as backup with various notable bands. All and all I consider the working together of two such musical greats an absolute credit to the rather crass and certainly fickle music industry a hit of large proportions."
2,A bit of a mess,"The Virgin Doctor Who novels allowed the writers to do something that couldn't be done on TV--they could bring back old companions. This is mixed blessing; on the one hand, it's great to see Ace, on the other, Ace is now a jerk! I know she was upset at the Doctor at the end of her last appearance, but that doesn't make it any more appealing.The other problem with this novel is it's vagueness. The Doctor et al land on your typical generic planet, with typical generic people. Nothing about the setting is terribly interesting. While it does turn out there's something significant about this, it doesn't really make this a very gripping read. The reuse of the maze scene from ""Horns of Nimon"" is a bad idea."
5,great lyrics,"Bob Dylan's first album since he became a born-again Christian. This album is filled with meaningful songs (as with his other albums), and it's great to listen to whether you are a Christian or not. Some of my favourites are ""I Believe In You"" and ""When He Returns"" musically and lyrically. I also very much enjoy the words of ""Man Gave Names To All The Animals"", especially the end of the song. (you should listen to at least this song!) I would definitely recommend this album!"
5,Chillin' with the Dylan...,"I dont care what those other folks say bout old dylan how he left for christianity , dont give me that...there just mad casue they dont believe in it and there ""leader"" now is into it so they make fun of him? thats sad but all in all this cd is awesome , nice relaxing scene it gives to sit back and listen to and sing to , this is a really good cd all put together and needs more credit but I guess it wont sence he left his ""old beliefs"" but everyone has stayed with him over all the years so just listen to the music..."
5,Excelente,Una de las grabaciones clásicas de Dylan. Temas con letras muy espirituales y llenas de emoción. Todo coleccionista debe tener este cd.
2,"SOUNDS good, but...","The music is good, his voice is still that lovable, scratchy drawl, but there's something different...the lyrics are awful. This is his second album from his born-again christian stage. Leave this one alone, skip it, don't even bother with it, unless you can completley ignore the lyrics and focus soley on the music and his voice. ""What God has given us, no man can take away"" - Precious Angel. Arghh!Go to Blood on the Tracks, or Blonde on Blonde. Some older stuff. Leave this alone."
4,much better than I expected,First one of the three religious natured albums I listened to and was plesantly surprised by how much better it actually was than I had anticipated.
3,another new morning,"bob goes off and does another church album here.""i belive in you"" and ""when he returns"" are the 2 best songs.the rest sounds like a musical genius doing church songs.theyre good and all,they just lack that dylan oooooomph we hadnt heard since the 60s."
3,Good If You Like Florida History,"If you are interested in early Florida living back when it was a sort of tropical wilderness, this is a great book. Very interesting and entertaining."
4,Café Pilon,"Being new to making my own espresso, I thought this coffee would be a good place to start since several reviewers liked it.I used it with a Bialetti Brikka stove-top espresso maker. The Brikka requires making(and throwing away)4 or 5 pots to season it.At first the Café Pilon tasted bitter, but with successive pots it became""smoother"", as did my technique.After more like 7 or 8 pots I was able to get better taste as well as the much desired crema."
5,Love it,"I purchased this product because I have a very bad problem with getting swollen feet due to reaction to a pain medication that I have to take. It get so bad that I can hardly walk. I saw this item online and decided to try it out. It is the best purchase that I made in a long time. It is so easy to use and boy does it help, you wish you could stay with your feet in it all day. Love the toe touch option on it . Just with a tap of your toe you can change the setting and turn it off. So easy. Everybody should have one."
2,FOOT SPA,"This products is good to use but not as good as what I expected.water temprature kept too softly, I need to add in more hot waterduring the foot spa."
2,Dr. Scholl's Foot Spar with bubbles model # DR6624,"Hello Everyone.I just pulled this foot spa out of my neighbors garbage. It was manufactured in 2007 and does not appear to have much use.The unit has 2 identical a/c motors inside, one of which would not run. Unfortunately, these motors are inexpensive and suffer from the lubricating oil drying out especially after they have become overheated. Please note on the bottom of the unit the warning not to use longer than 20 minutes at a time. I lubricated both motors with sewing machine oil and now the unit works perfectly.Could I now wrap it up and give it to my wife for Christmas? Who said I was cheap!!"
2,Way too loud,"It's cute, I'll give it two stars for that, but way too loud to actually turn on and enjoy."
2,Home Foot Spa,I found this product to be quite loud which takes away from the objective of relaxation...disappointed in Dr. Scholl's.
3,"Works as a foot bath, however","I purchased this item because I am seeking a method to soak my feet due to athletes foot and toenail fungus. So for that purpose, I'm satisfied.This product could be improved by the following recommendations:1. The vibrate mode is a little too noisy for my liking. And once the air(spa) mode is engaged, the noise volume is even higher. Definitely interferes with trying to soak and watch TV at the same time!2. I wish the manufacturer would have focused more on the heating aspect of the device. It claims to keep warm water warm for a longer period of time. I suppose this is true, but barely noticeable, if at all. I wish they would have installed a full fledged temperature controlled heating device. I could do without the vibrate and the bubbles :0).Given the relatively inexpensive price, I think it's still worth it, but you should know about the noise before you buy it."
3,EXTREMELY Loud,"Wow, this sucker is LOUD. It's like someone vacuuming the house- my husband tried to sit on the couch and use it, I could feel the vibrations through the floor and forget trying to talk or watch tv!"
3,okay but defective,"Interestingly enough, the bubbles on the right side doesn't work on my brand new machine, either. Amazon makes it super easy to return things so I'm going to try a new one. I was disappointed in how gentle the massage is but still like the way it felt. Also, it didn't seem to keep the water warm as long as my old and now leaky machine. For the price, it's just fine."
4,Bubbles didn't work,"The bubbles didn't work at all at first. Eventually they did barely start coming out - but only on one side. Yes the motor is indeed quite loud. However, I still give it 4 stars simply because of the rediculously low price and my fiance still enjoys the hot water and vibrations. What can we expect for less than $20? It's hardly even worth my time to return it for one with working bubbles but I am going to."
3,Foot Massage,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance but it doesn't quite meet the standards that he was looking for. He seemed rather disappointed with it.
3,"Alright, but nothing more.","This is the first footbath I have ever had. There are a lot of them on the market and I did not want to spend $100 on my first one. I found it a little to small for my feet, not the lenght of it, but the height. The water just barely covers the top of my foot, moreover the water got cold after a while, it is noisy and the bubbles were not that strong. However, if you consider the price and what you get it is not a bad product. I believe that ratio between product quality and price is among the best on the market."
2,Way too loud with the bubble on,"The good part-- it's really simple, easy. The bad part-- the noise is really loud. Forget relaxing before bed. It sounds like the Mother Ship is going to take off."
1,Wish I had listened to the bad reviews :(,"Doesn't massage, doesn't keep heat, doesn't really do anything that a tub of hot water couldn't do. It's so loud I can't use it and watch TV as well. What a piece of junk."
2,Doesn't keep water warm,"I got this when I was healing after ingrown toenail removal. I wanted the water to really stay very warm. This didn't do it. It would feel like there were strips on the bottom of the bath that kept my feet warm as the water cooled. Also, when you put the air jets on it is very noisy. I questioned how good it could be when we bought it for around $20 at Walgreen, and I was right. I should have just plunked the money and a bit more into one decent foot bath rather than wasting $20 and now having to go find a better one elsewhere. This will definitely cost me more money in the long run."
1,Broken already,"I have used this foot spa exactly twice, with only water the first time and with very little lavender Epsom salt the second time. Rinsed, dried, stored carefully. Tonight I was looking forward to it, but it won't turn on. Hopefully I can return it. $40 for two uses is a bit steep..."
1,Motor died after 2nd use,"I am 8 month pregnant and my feet has been killing me so I decided to order this foot spa after reading so many positive reviews. The bubbles were strong but you can't pour in too much water. The maximum level is not deep enough to cover your entire foot. I followed the directions exactly not to let it run for more than 20 mins. The second try, the motor died. I could hear some sounds but there were no bubbles whatsoever. I was able to receive full credit from the vendor. Product was bad but on the bright side, I received great customer service from the vendor."
1,died within 5 minues of FIRST use,"i purchased this product shortly after finding out i was pregnant and had started a new job where i was on my feet 50 hrs a week. needless to say my feet were very sore at the end of the day and i felt bad asking my boyfriend for a foot massage every night. so i bought this, thinking it's dr. scholl's they know what they are doing when it comes to foot care. i couldn't have been more wrong. i brought it home, set it up plugged in it, and it was nice for the first 4 1/2 minutes. then the power started to slow down and eventually shut off all together. within 5 minutes my brand new foot bath was completely dead. thanks."
3,"Not bad, but had better ones","I ordered this since I left my old one behind as I was moving. The product is not bad but much smaller than the one I had earlier. For women it is o.k., but for men with larger feet the space is way too tight.In several reviews it was mentioned that the unit does not heat up. Instructions say that it will NOT heat up water, but keep the temperature. Therefore these complaints are unjust.It is easy to carry and empty. Generally a good product but the next one I will buy in a store to check on the size."
5,"Worked for me, as well.","WARNING: NOT for persons with diabetes or if you have an open cut on the foot. (From the tag on the AC power cord.) Do NOT stand up in it -- it will break from your weight! (From the manual.) Recommended session length: 10 min. Max time turned on for one session: 20 min (from the manual). That said, it works for me. I used the elbow test to select desired tap water temperature, poured it into the foot spa, and turned on the vibrator/heater. Ten min. later -- enough for me -- temperature seemed the same to my elbow. The spa is very noisy when the ""bubble machine"" function is turned on; sounds like a 1950s vacuum cleaner. I'll do without that feature. It holds five pints of water to the --MAX-- fill line; its design makes it v-e-r-y easy to lift and empty without fear of spill."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Have had this for 2 weeks. First use, OK, felt good, nice bubbles but the attachments for the top didn't connect tight enough to stay on when you ran your foot over it. The attachment for inside the tub felt uncomfortable. Second use, felt good until I turned on the bubbles, not working on right side. It does keep the water warm. Now I have a foot spa from many years ago, no bells, no whistles just bubbles- it splashes all over the floor, is big & heavy plus water gets cold in minutes so you bale out & pour in hot water to keep it warm. The Dr. Scholl's is small, light weight but big enough for hubbies size 12 feet & comfortable to use if you just want to soak your feet with vibration plus water does stay warm. The foot control is an added plus, electrical cord is long enough, cleaning ability OK."
4,Relaxing,"If you expect the heating element in this unit to heat your water, forget it. I still love this foot massager. I didn't find the unit too loud (and I'm in my early 30s, so not deaf).I would suggest buying or using some sort of salt solution though...it makes the spa that much better. I also usually boil two cups of water and keep it handy after filling the spa with my hottest tap water. That way, the temperature is kept hot enough for the ~30 minutes max you would want to use it."
3,It's okay...,"To be honest, the only difference between this and a bucket of water is that you have the choice of vibration. I guess it is up to you whether it is worth the money. I rarely use mine."
5,foot spa review,"i bought this for my mother for mother's day. she loved it, and she said that i was so ""thoughtful!"" i am very happy with this product. but you should know that it doesnt heat up the water that you fill it with for you: you fill it with the water with a tempature to your liking and i guarantee that it'll maintain that temperature. and the bubbles are just awesome! thanks amazon :)"
5,best foot massager on market,"Bought another brand of foot massager at a well known chain store and it had alot of features that was built in the bottom of foot massager that made it very uncomfortable, and when you removed those features the grips for them was raised higher than the rest of the foot placement and would scrape the bottom of your feet so that brand was not a comfort for achey feet. I bought Dr. Scholl's because my father had one when I was younger, and true to form dr. scholl's was the most comfortable foot massager out on the market."
4,Good for price. Not spa-level though.,"This Foot Spa is very reasonably priced and does what it says: it keeps water warm, it produces bubbles and it has a vibrating massage. The shape and size make it easy to use whilst watching TV or surfing the net (yes, I surf while I spa).That being said, it is rather loud (so you can't watch a serious TV drama, etc, with the full bubble setting) and the vibrating massage is very basic. The attachments are not comfortable.Ultimately it's really quite cheap and if you just like a good soak then it's fine. If you're looking for the same experience as at an expensive salon, this isn't for you."
4,"Overall good, The only complaint is the noise.","Overall the foot spa is good, just a little bit noisy when it is turned on. But it is much noisier if you turn on the bubbles, as noisy as a vacuum cleaner. So I just don't turn on the bubbles."
1,Not worth it,"A big disappointment.After filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the ""warmer"" as advertized.It was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.I returned it for a refund."
2,Meh,Small for someone who has size 13 feet. Water splashes out of it while its on. I am not even sure if the warmer works. I wouldn't recommend.
2,Not a great product,This is just an ok product overall - the attachments inside are not very comfortable and the bubble mode is way too noisy to relax.Wouldnt recommend it.
1,foot spa,"I am disappointed as the piece I got , the bubbles didn't work on left side , so I had to return it."
2,dr. scholls foot spa,i purschased this item for my husband and it suppose to heat water or keep the water warm while soaking your feet. but this in fact was a waste of money cause the product did not do exactly what it said it suppose to. i wont be buying another Dr. Scholl's foot spa. 20 thumbs down from me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,bought as gift,"A friend of mine is a teacher, she is up on her feet all day. She said she uses it all of the time. The only thing is if you switch your foot position, the vibration changes intensity. We are not sure if this is supposed to happen, but other than that it's great."
2,not what I thought it would be,this dose not do what it says.One it dose not keep water warm .It is made for small feet. I have a size mans 13. Not big enough for me. should be wider for big guys like me.Would send it back but its to much to deal with.Just another bad choice.
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this to help my foot after surgery. The 'smart heat' did not keep the water warm at all, even though I made sure the water was very warm when I filled the spa. With or without the bubble action, the water cooled immediately. The 3 stationary massage attachments are in a very uncomfortable place for me, and cannot be re-positioned. This spa was a terrible disappointment, definitely not worth the trouble of setting it up and putting it away afterward."
4,Rewards!,This product I found to be quite rewarding for feet that need some extra TLC and the noise is tolerable (I've tried another and it was atrocious--plus didn't work that well). I did soak my feet for about ten minutes and felt quite a difference!Thank you Dr. Scholl!
1,This foot spa is not worth even one star,"This produce it extremely cheaply made. I had it one week and it began to leak. It did not keep the water warm even though it stated it would. You had to start off with hot water, but the heated feature did not keep it that way. Also the water cooled off very quickly if you turned on the bubble massage. The rollers on the bottom were very hard and hurt the bottom of my feet. I would give this less than one star if I could. Don't waste your money."
1,foot spa,It looks nice and the water moves vigorously. If that is what you need it's the right choice BUT it doesn't heat or keep hot hot so basically it's a tub of water. The moving bars in the bottom move if you move your feet across them and make them move.
2,Just okay,Pieces fall out. It is some work to get it out and fill up plug in and water gets cold quickly.
2,"Good massage, but no heat","Bottom of bath massage feet and feels great, but even when I feel it with very hot water, it does NOT retain the heat well. Has 2 settings. The second setting is too noisy to use for relaxation. Also hard to clean because plastic top part doesn't detach."
5,Great!,I got this product for a Chirstmas present a couple of years ago. It is great! My feet feels really good and relaxed after I use it!
3,Foot Massager,"I recieved the product on time, but unhappy that it doesn't keep the water warm. The water cools down tooo fast. But over all, the product works and get's the job done."
3,Eh you get what you pay for.,"It's not quite what I expected but what does somebody really expect for $20-25 dollars. The water heater could be much warmer and the message part is ""alright."" If I was to buy another foot massager I would have upgraded and spent more money. I recommend you do the same."
3,Too noisy,It does provide a good foot bath and keeps the water hot (you must start with hot water). My disappointment is the noise level. It is loud which tends to distract from the relaxation aspect.
1,Quite useless,"Just like a lot of other people who have written, it had a problem with the right side not producing any bubbles. Even with the bubbles that were being produced by the left side, it was just a whole lot of noise and very little substance or movement of water. In short, don't buy this product. It is a waste of money."
3,"Much too small for adult feet, arthritic feet","Works fine, but only if your feet are fairly small and supple. Bought it for my 86-year-old mother who really needs good footcare (diabetic, arthritic). She has difficulty bending her feet to fit into it. Also, the ""textured"" bumps that stick up into the soles hurt her feet, so we had to put a washcloth under each foot to relieve the pain. We're going back to the plain old rectangular basin."
3,Not upto my expectations,"When I purchased this item, I was under the impression that it'll maintain the water temperature...but it doesnt.Water gets cold after 5-10 min.Even the vibrating massage is not very good. When I switch to bubble mode....it makes lot of noise. I had similar kind of item previously....i guess home-medics/conair as well......that was far better in terms of vibrating massage and maintaining water temperature."
5,Sweet Fellowship,"I own this recording in Audio cassette form, originalcaseband artwork. This is,by far. the best recording that acapella has produced. I get emotional everytime I play it. I would be willing to trade for a CD of the same title."
5,you want revival? you got it...hits the soul and heart!,I love this Acapella collection! It's an old one but the words of these songs and the harmony just tug the soul. This revives my heart and renews the joy in me. You want sweet fellowship w/ others and God? You wanna get saved? You wanna view that Holy city and meet Jesus? You wanna share with others the love of Christ? I tell you...get this cd! It's great! -Nichole D.
3,"Brian, freestyle fan for over 10 years","This Album has most of his hits, but they left out a few really good tracks. Thump Records must have not done their homework! Why didn't they put the songs; ""Runaway Love"", ""I Know That You Love Me"", ""I Wanna Make Love To You"", and maybe ""Don't Go Away"" on the album? They even messed up tracks 11 & 12, by printing track 11 as a ""Highways of Love"" remix when it's actually a remix of ""I Gave My Heart to You"" and also printing track 12 as The Music's Got me when its a remix of ""Memories"". Sloppy work Guys!! Johnny O deserves better! I wish I could of compiled this album and then maybe fans could experience all of his Hits with higher quality!!"
2,not what i expected,"when i was looking to buy this book i could only see a picture of the cover and didn't know what's inside. when i got it i was sort of disappointed. all that was inside was a few pages with openings for pictures, which is a cute idea but i would have liked to have known before i puchased it."
3,Wasn't what I expected.,"When the book arrives I was enchanted with the presentation, but when I opened it I was a little dissapointed because it only have spaces to fill with photos ,but no other thing at all. I thought that it may have something written , like a family member title or any space to write family's information."
2,Confusing Examples,"As a struggling calculus student (ended up in calc I three times and calc II four times) I found the book at times to be difficult to understand and the many of the example problems seemed to skip over some of the steps. The worst part of the book was the solutions manual, which often bore little, if any, difference from the answers in the back of the book and was therefore largely a waste of money. In some cases, the back of the book provided more detailed solutions than the solutions manual. I originally took the course at a major institute of higher learning. I repeated calculus at a community college that used a different book. The other book was about twenty bucks cheaper and provided better examples and solutions in the solutions manual. Granted I was a poor (as in not good) student when I was a freshman, but the other book seemed much better."
4,Sinbad And The Soundtrack of the Tiger,"Another kid-hood fav, the music transports me back to the days of the Saturday $1.25 (!!) movies where first I saw Sinbads adventures a good soundtrack that complemnts a legendary movie."
3,12+,"I'm always looking for stories I think my children might enjoy, even if they are too young for them at the time. Call it whatever you want but just as I screen tv shows and movies they watch I also screen the books they read.The story behind the Grey Griffins is entriging and well suited for children 12 and above. There were parts to the story that I felt would be difficult for younger kids to follow and really didn't make a lot of sense. Although most of this was cleared up at the end of the book, I felt some kids might become lost and confused. For those parents more on the conservative side, I would recommend reading the book yourself before allowing your kids to read it."
2,Shadow King,Book would have had potential if authors had made up their mind what age group they were writing for. Characters were very young but action is too mature and intense for the target age group. Plot seems to drift somewhat too.
4,Worth a read,"I didn't know what to expect with this book. I never figured it would be based around a game. I enjoyed the characters, Ernie is a wimp, but he grows on you as the book progresses. This isn't a page turner, nor is it boring. It did seem as alot was going on and the Grey Griffins were supposed to be saving the town etc etc, however, they did alot of talking. Not alot of action on their part. This book felt like the first Harry Potter book where you know its full of magic but you just don't seem to find alot of it actually practiced in the first book. This was a good book, not excellent, hence the 4 stars. I will be reading the rest of series."
5,I devoured the book in one day,I absolutely loved the Revenge of the Shadow King. I couldn't stop reading it. I read it as I walked home from school and read it every spare minute that I could. A must read for anyone!
1,Trite - don't bother - Here's some other recommendations,"I pre-view books for my neice, nephew, and my frined's sons (ages 4, 7, and 10).Don't bother with this book. The story has potential but it's writen for a reader that is assumed to be completely unintelligent (and so are the characters).Example: Kids are told not to do something...in the NEXT SENTENCE they go and do it. No story build up, no circumstance that forces the kids into it.Example: Here's a common writing method in this book...""I don't get it"" said Ernie. He was confused.-Obviously he was confused. The writer doesn't have to spell it out for the reader because the character says it himself...but to make the book longer, the author does.Spend your time on better some better series:The Children of the LampThe Last ApprenticeChronicals of Ancient DarknessHarry Potter (of course)The Hobbit"
5,Amazing,"This book kept me intertained until the very last page, if you loved harry potter, you will love this"
5,armchair,"Destined to be beyond the Harry Potter series--More beliveable real life problems, with all the creatures that an adventurous mind would do battle with- in the closet, under the bed, in the forest and all the other far reaches of our imagination."
5,Tis a GOOD book!,"This is a great beginning for what hopefully will be the foundation of a fantastic and imagination filled series. I enjoy fantasy writings, but sometimes books just don't cut it, which I happily say is not true with this book. Though the book is about 11 year olds in 5th grade, it is still action filled and has few mistakes as far as I have seen. Read. Enjoy."
4,Its Great,"The tracks are good, and some of the scores are very well played and very well precived by the musicians. It is a great soundtract for a fast-pace and mellow tone in the car or at home."
2,Flashes Of Brilliance,"Intonation good. Drugs bad. Nothing a piano tuner, an outside producer & a couple of days to clean up couldn't fix. I was gonna write ""for hardcores only"", but I'm a hardcore 'Blood fan & this pretty much just made me sad. Can't blame Gaylord Birch though, who's skin-tight throughout."
5,Violanta ; Korngold's first opera,"Excellent cast, orchestra and recording. This opera is closer to Das Wunder der Heliane, Korngold's masterwork, than any of his other operas; heavy modern orchestral effects with eclectic Puccini, Strauss , Mahler and Wagner ideas recognizable. The CBS version is very expensive compared to the more recent Sony reburning.However it has much fuller documentation which was useful to me for some lectures i'm giving on Korngold."
4,"Good, but missed a few songs!!!","Where are ""Remember Tomorrow"", and other songs that made Maiden, otherwhise is a good start in a new Maiden fan!!"
1,disappointing!!!,"I am Chinese American and have recently discovered Iron Maiden through a friend. I became a big fan and own most of their stuff. I highly recommend Iron Maiden for all rock fans but its a bad start with this ""essential"". This is more like a ""Single Collection"" with some additional tracks. Where are all the epic songs, their real gems ""Rhime of the Ancient Marriner"", ""To Tame a Land"", ""Mother Russia"" and so on? These songs are the real essential songs. So donts waste your money with this CD and buy all their great albums."
3,Essential?,"This isn't a bad collection. But I'm not sure how they can consider it essential since 95% of the time it sticks to a rigid 2 song representation from each album. Many times this just doesn't work. The Number of the Beast has the title track and Run to the Hills, both here, but Hallowed Be Thy Name is just as essential, and it's missing. Only their first album gets more than 2 tracks, but Sanctuary is still missing. Space has to be considered, I know, but Powerslave and Rime of the Ancient Mariner should be here. Why not include Mariner instead of Sign of the Cross? It's a much better song. Can I Play With Madness is definitely essential but missing. Wildest Dreams should be here too. Get Best of the Beast (2 cd version). It's getting a bit older now, so it doesn't include any of their last 3 studio albums, but it's still much better. Ed Hunter's better than this too. Edward the Great is pure garbage. Better yet, get all of their albums, these guys couldn't make a bad album if they tried."
4,Good Compilation of Heavy Metal from a Great Band,"I am not an expert on either heavy metal or Iron Maiden. I'm more of a Stones fan. However, I love Iron Maiden's sound, and have for many years. They are an intelligent band, both musically and lyrically. This two-CD compilation offers most of their tops songs, unedited (I think) and the sound is incredible. While heavy metal may not be as big as it used to be, those who remember it with nostalgia and long for its energy, layered beauty, and sheer overpowering sound will find this collection to be manna for a heavy metal soul.These guys were simply the best of the genre, for over twenty years. Put this on your CD changer and prepare to bang your head."
2,Greatest Hits? Where?,"This album is another way of the record labels trying to put their hands in your pockets. Even though I am a Maiden fan, I would avoid this one and pick up Edward the Great instead for a GH album.PS Varg Vikernes, this is a second time I had to correct you, Holly Diver was DIO, not Iron Maiden."
2,Essentially a money making scheme,"Wow!!! Here it is the Essential Iron Maiden compilation we have all been dreaming about. NOT!!!Essential Iron Maiden includes songs from the albums, IRON MAIDEN (1980), KILLERS (1981), THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST (1982), PIECE OF MIND (1983), POWERSLAVE (1984), SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1986), SEVENTH SON OFA SEVENTH SON (1988), NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING (1990), FEAR OF THE DARK (1992), THE X FACTOR (1995), VIRTUAL XI (1998), BRAVE NEW WORLD (2000) and DANCE OF DEATH (2003).If you're a fan of heavy metal, and you're seeking the best introduction to Iron Maiden, this will only give you a tolerable track list of this bands history, but where are the epic Maiden tunes. Regrettably, the finest Maiden compilation was the two disc set ""Best of the Beast,"" which is no longer available. This collection is more like a single collection with a few supplementary tunes. Buyers beware!"
5,It is essential,"Great CD. It is what it says: an essential collection. Sure, many good songs were not included, but a CD has limited room... if you are really into Maiden, get their albums!Good quality. The songs sound good remastered."
4,"Too many Blaze tracks, not enough Paul Di'Anno*","This 2 cd set is hands down the best Iron Maiden collection out there...only one problem- Why only 3 tracks with original singer Paul Di Anno, and 4 with Blaze Bayley? This boggles the mind, or a piece of it anyway. Cut out ""Man On the Edge"", and put in ""Remember Tomorrow"" or ""Sanctuary""...then you'd have a perfect mix. Other than that, this is a great cd. Of course, all the Bruce Dickinson stuff is essential, but Paul deserves a little more respect, in the track selection-especially in comparison to Blaze. But hey, that's just me."
2,Compilation again ?,"Iron Maiden is most popular heavy metal band at the world,but these compilations of this big bands are not very interesing.Classics tracks of first album Iron Maiden to the last Dance of Death.With no bonus songs,or rare live and studio outtakes tracks.So,with no good idea.maybe for people who's don't know what are I.M.boring!!!!"
4,Overall Good But...,"Where is ""Murders In The Rue Morgue"" off Killers, or tracks like ""Powerslave"", ""Losfer Words"", or ""Flash Of The Blade"",""Where Eagles Dare"" is also missing."
4,Iron Maiden? One of the best metal bands? Nope.,"Iron Maiden is not one of the best bands of all-time. I was listening to one of their records and it seems tame compared to albums released by Judas Priest, Pantera, Megadeth, Metallica and Guns N' Roses. The heaviest album that I have heard in recent memory would be anything by Pantera. ""Mouth for War"" is one of the heaviest songs recorded.Iron Maiden is a great metal band- but not the best of all-time.Iron Maiden's album, No Prayer for the Dying, is one of their worst albums.Here's my top ten metal bands:1. Black Sabbath2. Metallica3. Megadeth4. Judas Priest5. Pantera6. Anthrax7. Skid Row8. Guns N' Roses9. Motley Crue10. AC/DCPlease feel free to change the order- but these are the ten best metal bands of all-time.Sorry, Iron Maiden just ain't one of them!!"
3,The not quite essential Iron Maiden,"There is some terrific material here. But there is a mindbogglingly large amount of filler. For a band with so many great songs, this is inexcusable.The Blaze Bayley songs should not be on here, end of story. 4 bletcherous scabs taking up space that could go to good songs. Really, Hallowed Be Thy Name is not on this, but Sign Of The Cross is? Why Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter? That has got to be the worst Iron Maiden song not sung by Bayley.I really don't care for Paul Di'anno, but appreciate the contribution he made.Also missing is Dance of Death, and Stranger In A Strange Land.The best track on this CD is Fear of the Dark, which really shows how great they are live.All and all this is not bad, if you don't have many(or any) Maiden albums, this is a good place start."
4,Some of Iron Maiden's best,"Most of the band's best songs are on this set, although they let off Sea of Madness. Nice assortment though."
2,essential to who?,more than half the set is essential but redone 6 times before the other 40% is new non essential songs.
2,Why?,"Gee another freaking greatest hits package from Maiden. It seems that the once mighty metal machine is starting to lose some of its energy!! It's the same material that has been released for the past ten years! Maiden used to pump out records like George Bush spends the budget, fast and furious!! Now Maiden follows this cycle, new album, greatest hits package, live album, greatest hits, new album!!"
5,An excellent book of an extraordinary story,"Being Italian I had the opportunity to read the original book. I began reading at night time, and it was a big mistake because I could not put it down. The book is really cool it has funny parts and you really laugh. But the book makes you emotional when Alex talks in details about the horrific racing accident. My mother, who does not like racing, liked the book a lot and found it very inspirational. I think it's a story that crosses the motorsport community. If I could paraphrase Lance Armstrong I would say ""It's not about the car"". I just bought the US edition because I'm eager to read Mario Andretti's foreword and the exclusive new chapter that was not in the Italian edition. My suggestion is buy it, it's worth it!CiaoGabriele"
1,Very disappointing,"I tried this CD after reading it's wonderful reviews but get very disappointed. The rhythm of all the songs in the CD is truly slow and drowsy. Even for songs that should bring out passion, I feel weary when I listened to the music. I don't know why they choose this way to play classical hymns. I would prefer to listen to hymns sang by ordinary choir in the Church than this one."
4,The Meters Major Label Debut,"Many fans of the Meters are of the opinion that Rejuvenation is the best LP from the group's Reprise tenure. I am not one of them. Cabbage Alley is the best LP the Meters made for Reprise. The songs are well written and compact, which differs from Rejuvenation which relied more on the groups musical dexterity. Cabbage Alley displays the writing talents of guitarist Leo Nocentelli. He creates songs and arragements that really dig into the soul of a person. The Meters, who are known for their funk tunes, show a conscience and tenderness on this album without sacrificing the funk they delivered on there three Josie albums. Cabbage Alley is artistry at its finest."
1,Insulting,"Please do not buy this book to read to your children. It is insulting and pushes overused stereotypes. I read it, and was so angry I wanted to burn it."
1,Makes a good gag gift,"This book is so dumb, it actually made me laugh. I didn't think it could possibly be for real. The house that crack built...? As another reviewer mentioned, it has every bad sterotype in it. Only the poor and downtrodden use drugs, right? Give me a break. I bought it for a friend as a gag gift. He thought it was so ridiculous that he had a good chuckle. Don't buy this to ""teach"" kids! It won't teach them the right message. At best, this book is so over-the-top that it's funny. At worst, it is an insulting and prejudicial little book."
5,Celebration of a renowned Irish folk poet,"This is a fine book, paying homage to a unique and rare woman of Irish history and literature. Máire Bhuí (1774-1849) was one of the last true Gaelic bards to write in Irish in Gaelic Ireland. It is all too easy to lose oneself in the wonderful content of this book and all the thoughts and visions it provokes. It contains a generous selection of her writing, both in Irish and in new English translations. Irish-language lovers will relish the poetry in all its lyricism and English-language readers will benefit from the concise accompanying translations. Her laments, love songs, religious meditations, and aislingí (vision poems) fairly rise up off the page with passion and faith. It should be on the mandatory reading list of every Irish-language class and in the hands of every lover of Irish culture and history."
2,Bear Scout handbook,I was disappointed with this item. Partially due to my own lack of knowledge. I thought when an item was listed as -like new- that it would not be written in and usable for a new scout. I had to buy another book and throw away this one.
4,Sex Appeal by Lori Foster,"Shadow Callahan needs to find 10 guys to enter in the sexiest man contest. Fate steps in when Brent Bramwell, falls in front of her window in front of her shop. Sex Appeal features all kinds of interesting ""stuff"". Brent never thought he would be drawn to someone like Shadow. He always was in control and realised after meeting Shadow that his life was a little too much in control. It is only fitting that Sex Appeal is being used to launch the new HEAT line, since it provides alot of HEAT. Sex Appeal is wonderful. Brent and Shadow are a classic Lori Foster couple and you get to visit a couple of old friends as well. Hurry and get this book, because it will surely fly off the shelves."
4,Very Appealing!,"Wow - Lori Foster certainly knows how to thrill her readers with a steamy romance! Here, Brent Bramwell and Shadow Callahan fall (almost literally) for each other and they are truly a delightful couple with her free-spirited honesty a perfect foil to Brent's more rigid and professional attitude. I did find myself wanting to yell at them occasionally - when you are being stalked you don't do anything alone - aaarrgh!!! But other than a couple of obvious plot devices, this was a lovely story about two charming people. I recommend this as a fun afternoon read with your favorite beverage and munchies!!"
5,Ms. Foster is a writer I enjoy ...,"I have been reading the books of this writer for a long time and I have to tell ya, Ms. Foster is a writer that I enjoy...a lot! Her characters quite simply rock!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!,I am a big Lori Foster fan but I found this book a huge disappointment. I found the heroine ditsy and not very bright. The story itself was just so-so. I just know Lori is capable of better.
5,Not for the faint...,"Sex, death, and zoophilia are a few of the themes presented in this collection of madness. Die Puppe is probably one of the least accessible Die Form albums I've ever heard (in a canon of works that are already in themselves far from ""accessible""), so unless you are an advanced lister of gothic/industrial (and can fully appreciate Philip Fichot's disturbed nature), take the other reviewer's advice and go with a Best Of. If not, prepare for your decent into darkness."
5,Charts of the Gospels and the Life of Christ - Very helpful !!,"Very helpful charts and summaries. It shparly reduces research time. It is a ""must have"" for teachers and pastors. I am teaching the Gospel of John and it is so helpful to find the parallel passages. THe chronology presented is also very helpful to put it all together.I highly recommend it."
4,A coffee table book worth browsing,"Definitely worth looking at but maybe not as compelling as a ""reading book"" if you don't have much interest in Ms. Merser's own garden dilemmas and adventures.Massive and clean photographs bring a variety of styles and landscape features to life. For it's ease in thumbing through and printed excellence, it qualifies as an amazingly well designed book; it meets and exceeds the challenge for a book based on the subject of design. The content structure, illustrative artwork and captions are outstanding, too.If a subsequent publishing were to be printed, I might suggest a little less base editorial and more photographic and illustrative artwork, with each given more insight and history in the caption. Hardly a criticism though, this book certainly could excite even the casual gardener. This is a very worthy book to either borrow or own."
3,Pretty pictures but not very helpful,I was disappointed with this book because I was hoping to get information that I could apply to my own garden. The author shared her enthusiam for gardening and much of the book seemed to encourage us to be creative and follow our heart. I was hoping for some practical information about garden design.
2,Cover very nice BUT,This $50.00 book has a beautiful cover--but when you try to look inside--the images are purposefully hidden--are you ashamed of them?? I would NOT spend $50.00 on a book that I could not preview! VT
5,Nicely organized with alot of vaiety and food for thought,I liked this book very much. It had gorgeous pictures and an interesting way to look at gardening. It showed me things about my own style of gardening that I was doing but not really aware of what exactly or why exactly I was doing it. It was inspiring and motivating.
5,Vintage R&B!,"I've been playing two tracks from this CD with the help of Live365.com's music library. I've gotten some positive response from my audience with the tracks, so I decided to request a copy from the artist for a review. The style of the recording is R&B with a mix of funk and soul blended in. Bostick has some quality names helping out on this recording. Among others, longtime R&B producer Norman Connors (You are My Starship) and veteran soul singer Jean Carn. Together, they give this recording class and prestige. The highlights of the CD are the tracks, ""You Need Love"" and ""Kelli's Theme"". Both tracks are clearly highly regarded and produced with outstanding quality. This CD has allot for for everyone. Consider purchasing this great recording. Highly recommended!"
1,Horrible - especially for the price!,"This video did not go in to very much detail about any area. It seems to have been sponsered by local sites/restaurants. Also, I ordered it because it was a 2009 release. Most of the video was obviously shot in the 1980's. The quality of the picutre is horrible. I would not buy this video."
5,Listening to Nature...We surely need to!,"Cheri's work is a sincere, sensitive and unique exploration of the 'inner realms' of Nature, and an expression that we would be well advised to consider in this age of dire warnings about the degradation of our environment. The 'inner beings of nature' come alive as they reach out and send us 'messages'. I suspect Cheri would encourage us all to 'tune into' nature, however we can do it, to cooperate with the forces that 'hold our planet' together, and hopefully, to find a way to ameliorate and if we are fortunate, reverse the present negative trends into positive adventures of spirit."
3,Episodic Roller-Coaster,"Haldeman & Co. throws multiple techniques at the reader: sections dealing with adventures on different planets, coming-of-age chronicle, and discourse on mankind's future in the galaxy. Here, authorities rigidly enforce co-existence, limiting most conflicts so they do not spread between planets. There are intriguing predictions on commerce, terra-forming and First Contact with other races. And strangely, the plot twists hold it all together.Contrary to the cover and title, this is not really a military or space novel, but I cannot tell what sci-fy genre it should belong to."
5,"One of my firsts, still a favorite","I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and it has stuck with me throughout my life. I have litterally read at least one copy to tatters, and will be soon buying a new copy.The book is basically a coming of age story of Carl, a genetically engineered ""giant"" from a planet where only giants could stand up in the windstorms, let alone survive.The book covers his travels to 3 planets on an interstellar university: Earth, Hell and Construct. All three stops show insight into his character, and you can watch him grow mentally, emotionally and spiritually.I highly recommend this book for purchase."
2,Young Adult Action Adventure,"This is a minor adventure novel best appreciated by young adults although there is probably more violence then parents would prefer. Basically the book is three novellas describing the adventures of Carl, a tennager genetically engineered for ""giantism"" to survive the dangerous environment of his home world. He's getting an education aboard Starschool as it travels between planets. The first two novellas are strictly action adventure with the barest hint of science fiction. There's lots of animal wrestling, fights, and battle scenes, but very little learning or smarts on Carl's part. The last novella has Carl and his friends exploring a Contruct that contains the many different alien species and their home environments.Although Joe Haldeman does briefly revisit his favorite topic of a conscript soldier this books is nothing like his award winning novels ""Forever War"" or ""Forever Peace"". This is for young action adventure fans; Thought provoking SF this is not."
4,Good Story,"I read a number of Monica Hughes' books back in 1999 because she is the favorite author of a friend. Though some were harder to find, I enjoyed all I could lay my hands on. Her books have been translated into dozens of languages.This is an interesting little book about a society's attempt to make a perfect city - a city run by a computer, where the computer becomes the tyrant instead of man. The fight to save the city is lead by two friends, Caroline the computer designer's daughter and her friend David.This is a great book and I highly recommend it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"

4,My take away,"I got the audio books and listened to it at work. It was a pretty eye opening perspective to listen how young people came out of the depression, went to war and came home to build families, companies and their lives."
3,From the author...,"In answer to some previous reviews, the book was written against 8i, 9i and 10gR1. The book was finished and with the publishers before the release of 10g Release 2, so it doesn't contain event based scheduling.The scheduler updates in 10gR2 are explained on my website.CheersTim...PS. I rated this post to match the current average rating, so as not to affect the overall rating of this product :)"
1,Incomplete (for 10.2) repeat of Oracle Manuals,I bought this book after browsing the DBMS_SCHEDULER sections of the 10.2 manuals. I didn't find anything that wasn't already better explained in the manuals. A lot of DBMS_SCHEDULER functionality was missing (e.g. creating job chains).
4,Nice canister set,"Attractive set and color true to picture. Seals could be a bit tighter, but still have worked fine for me."
3,The Gold Cannisters are more Mustard colored,"Very cute canisters. Nice size and has a seal on each lid. One of the seals doesn't seem to fit snug on the middle size canister. I purchased the gold colored canisters and it looks more of a mustard color, nothing I expeceted. Kind of a drab mustard color."
4,Good deal for the money,"The color doesn't really look ruby, during the day it's an orangy-red color, at night it looks more red. The seals aren't the best, but they stay closed and look nice on your counter."
3,One-time only mistake?,"Well, these are what they are... cannisters with lids for storing things. There isn't a lot about these that are special, but there was one thing quite concerning about the lid when I got it.I don't know if all orders come this way, or just mine... but there was a fine layer of what felt like fiberglass dust coating the silicone stopper on the underside of the lid.I'm not particularly comfortable with the idea of people using these to store food (flour, sugar, etc) and not noticing this powder."
3,Nice but too small,"These canisters do look nice, but they are too small to hold flour, sugar, or anything else for that matter, unless you just want to fill them a little at a time. Too expensive for what they are."
4,Pretty nice and heavy duty,"Great seal, heavy duty, decent sized; these canisters are durable and eye catching.I did run them through the dishwasher initially to verify cleanliness which left occassional dark brown striping. This gives a somewhat rustic look and isn't too noticeable, but I would have preferred that not to have happened - just a heads-up."
3,Not quite Ivory,"I ordered this set to match my kitchen, thinking that they would be the color as listed. The color is more like a buttery-cream than an Ivory. Other than the color, I love the quality of these items."
2,"Lovely, but not Airtight","I was disappointed to find that the lids did not fit snugly enough to be even remotely airtight. The middle canister's lid was the worst one with a 1/4"" gap on one side. The seals are very thin and seemed kind of flimsy. They were really lovely though, but because I was needing airtight canisters, I had to return them. I didn't order another set because I didn't expect the quality to be much better on the 2nd try."
3,Seals are NOT airtight,"When I received my order, I loved the look of the canisters. They looked exactly as they did online. I was glad that the color was true to the pictures at Amazon.However, once I stored sugar in one of my canisters, the problem with the ""airtight"" seal became apparent. Water got into the sugar and it hardened. The problem is that the seals are cheap. They don't seem to be made for this set. They make it difficult to seat the lid on its base properly. On the other hand, the seals come off so easily (some may say too easily) that they're easy to clean."
5,"Problems at first, but Signature Housewares made it right.",When my canister set arrived I found that the lids on two of the canisters didn't fit properly. I contacted Signature Housewares and they promptly arranged for a replacement.I am very happy with the product and even happier with the customer service I received.I won't hesitate to buy from them again.
4,Cute set,"This is a cute canister set... looks great on the counter. The design embossed into the ceramic adds a nice touch to make each piece unique, yet still has a uniform appearance. The color is nice, but I wouldn't really call it ""burgundy"" as advertised. It is more of a wine/apple mixture... don't really know what the real name would be for that color! I read a lot of opinions about the seals before I bought this set... no, they won't be waterproof if that's important to you (they're not that tight), but they do seal well enough to keep your flour/sugar fresh. My only disappointment is that I was hoping the largest one would be big enough to hold a 5lb. bag of flour, but that isn't the case. The largest one will hold a bag of sugar, the medium one holds a bag of brown sugar, and I'm using the smallest for storing our homemade hot cocoa. Overall, a good ceramic set (especially for the price) that looks cute on your counter."
2,Sorrento canisters green,I purchased this set through Amazon. The finish is very poor. A lot of brown clay bare spots showing through the green glaze. Not attractive! Would only buy again if I could hand pick pieces.
1,cannisters too small,"Loved the colors of the cannisters and loved the way they sealed, but they are too small. They don't hold a 4 lb. bag of sugar or the 4-5 lb. of flour, so you would have to leave some in the bag. For this reason I returned them."
5,Very Nice Canisters,"Smaller than I anticipated, but they are very nice and the color matches the picture on Amazon. Arrived quickly and in good shape. The seal seems to fit very well."
5,Lovely Color and Seals Are Airtight,"Heavy weight, well-made with a seal so tight that it 'hisses' when i put the lid down. The color is more what I call 'berry' than a true red, very nice. I wish they were bigger but these will do just fine.The bottoms are smooth and don't scrape on my quartz counter top. The detail on the sides is raised. And the seals are removable which I very much appreciate. Easier to clean.The biggest plus is the color and seal. Don't pass these up!"
2,Loose Seals,"The seal on the large cannister is not tight. I called Signature, but they said I'd have to call Amazon to straighten this out. Very disappointed."
3,Pretty but not sturdy,"These canisters are just what I was looking for, but the packing used is not infallible. The smallest canister came with a chip in the top upper edge. Returning it was more work than I wanted to go to. So I display the canister with the chip is on the back side. Not ideal. Each canister should be wrapped a little better so that they will ship without any damage."
5,Canister set,This canister set is great......love the red color and the seals work very well.would recommend to my friends and family.
2,Small,"I don't now about you I use canisters to store items I use in the kitchen. The large will hold maybe 5lb sugar if you tamp it down as you fill it. Flour forget. it,it won't fit. The med. size will hold a 13 oz can of coffee and the small size a few tea bags.They are next to useless to me. If you are looking for canisters to hold supply's as I was,don't buy these."
3,smaller than they look,"Cannisters arrived fine, but were smaller than they looked. The largest could not hold a 5 pound bag of flour."
5,Perfect shade of red canisters,"I had been looking for a set of red canisters for my kitchen and came across these, hoping that they would be an attractive dark red shade. Perfect. They look very nice in my kitchen with my other red accents. I also like the Sorrento look. I may have to purchase some other Sorrento items. Fast delivery too."
5,It's perfect in every way,This set is totally perfect. I broke a lid from my previous set. I decided to take my time and shop. Voila!! the red is the perfect color. The size is perfect. The seal on them is really firm and I need that. I might buy a set to give someone a gift. This set is superb.
2,Nice canister set,"Item itself was very nice, however the color (burgundy) was not quite as dark as pictured. The item was returned but ordered in another color (ruby). The second item arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition."
4,Love these . . . but,My husband and I recently did some upgrades in our kitchen and I decided to purchase these and get rid of my hideous white canisters to give our kitchen a little pop of color. I love the color that I choose (Ruby) and it happened to match our wall choice almost perfectly.The canisters are very cute and well made. The seal I am not so sure about but for now I am happy with it.My only issue is that these canisters run small. The largest canister will not hold a full 5lb bag of flour and/or sugar and I have googled to see if I can purchase additional canisters without purchasing another set and unable to locate. I have also tried to look for a larger canister and was unsuccessful.Would love if the company come up with a larger canister as I could use a few of them.
4,Pretty vs Practical,"I ordered this set of canisters for a splash of color and I got what I wanted. Problem is, I really DO cook and bake and these are REALLY teenie (e.g., the smallest one does not hold a full bag of coffee); not at all practical."
3,Glass top required,"The table looks nice and is a good size. The problem is that it does not come with a glass table top. In the heat, the top gets warm and stretches, making things on the table tip over or sink. It is also difficult to clean with no top. I would give this table a 5 star rating if the glass top was included. I had to purchase one separatly for $160, making the overall cost of the table somewhat expensive. I do LOVE the strathwood collection though, a good value and beautiful furniture."
4,coffee table,Bought this table for our weekend house in the woods. It looks great. I would say on the light side but we have not had it long enough to give a notice of how well it holds up. But so far so good. It is not quiet the same color as the chairs and sofa.
4,A good buy,"The coffee table looks good and is a great size, although it could be a little taller. It was very easy to assemble. The weather is still cold here so I don't know if it will require a glass top as mentioned in one of the reviews. I plan to use a large serving tray on it."
1,Terrible substitute,"I purchased a pair of these brackets (same number and photo) about 2 months ago and was very happy with them. I just purchased (9/2011) another pair that were very sub par to the first purchased even though they had same number and picture on Amazon, they did not look anything like the picture and are junk, not nearly bas high quality as first pair."
3,"Work ok, not cheap","These don't work quite as well as I had hoped. I have ended up using tape to ensure they don't fall off, so now I'm wondering why I bothered paying so much for special blocks instead of just using leftover bubble wrap or something."
2,Dry as sawdust,"I am a history buff and familiar with the area to which the book refers. Unfortunately, I found it dull and it did not sustain my interest. I had great difficulty finishing it. Very disappointing reading experience."
3,poor image quality,"This monitor is great value of you don't really care about the accuracy of color. It's quite bright and has great contrast though it has an occasional faint swarming grain that does not go away with auto-adjust. You may or may not notice the grain. I tried for over an hour to get the colors calibrated and eventually gave up. It has a few pre-defined color profiles and they are all useless and wildy inaccurate. Colors are bright and over-saturated because they are clipped so it's pretty, just not accurate.For games and text it's probably great but side-by-side with a good quality LCD you can definitely tell the difference. I would pass on this one if you do any photo editing or create graphics people are going to look at on other monitors."
3,OK but made in China so will die in couple of years.,"This monitor has a beautiful picture when it works but it's made in China so expect it to die in just a couple years. I picked up one at Goodwill for $15 that looked to be in good shape but it wouldn't turn on and the power button blinked all the time like it was in power saving mode. Upon taking it apart I found that all the capacitors in the power supply were bad which is something that also happens with motherboards, PC power supplies and other devices made in China. The capacitors are easy to replace though and it's working great again now. For some interesting reading Google ""China capacitor problems"" and check out badcaps dot net for photos of what they look like."
2,Faulty Manufacturing,"The monitor itself works great. There was 1 pixel missing when I opened the product however. Over time, the metal pieces connecting the monitor to the stand have allowed gravity to take its toll - the pieces bent so that the monitor now looks down. I have it set really high on something and it is still kind of awkward. It is not able to be fixed either. This happened to both me & my brother, who also has the same monitor."
3,buy the 206bw,the Samsung 206bw is a newer version of this monitor. cost is comparable. image quality should be better.
4,Lenox Holiday dessert set,This set will be great addition to my dishes at Christmas. I am looking forward to using these dishes. The table will look very festive.
5,Glimpses into the psyche of a comix genius,"It is easy to deconstruct the graphic ouvre of R. Crumb. This does not mean that understanding his creative mind is an easy task. This collection of his letters from the early years of his career gives the reader a glimpse into the passions and motivations of America's formost cultural iconoclast.This book is not for the Politically Correct crowd, which is a blessing. Crumb is not only honest in his creative work, but in describing his attitudes about American popular culture--the more obscure the expression, the more he appreciates it.A must-have for any scholar of pop culture."
3,"Very Good, But Could Have Been Better.","I purchased this book because I've long wondered why that portion of Canada south of the St. Lawrence River didn't get lumped in with the U.S. colonies. That question was answered, along with a lot of others. Very enjoyable, clear, concise with a bit of cheek. Would have given it 5 stars except for one glaring shortcoming-- Where are the maps? This is after all a ""Dummies"" book.Its readers by definition aren't familiar with the places being discussed. Some maps would have been very useful to put the narrative information into context."
5,Canadian History for Dummies,"Have not received this book yet. Hopefully it will be in the mail soon. Was ordered quite a while ago. However, I have used this book before and it is great for teachers. Has great information, easy to follow and find different periods in the history of Canada. Love the write-ups on the people who made history in Canada. Used all this information to help be better understand the history of Canada. Added interesting facts to share with my class."
2,excellent choice fo one of them,"One came with a flaw. Since I live outside of USA, It's not easy to return the product. Sorry Kodak, but I am not happy."
5,Best Camera for Realtors,"Very versatile. Dual lenses make it perfect for my real estate business. Wide angle lens is perfect to show best view of certain rooms and home exteriors and vistas. Telephoto lens is perfect to show off specific details and features like cabinetry, mouldings, fireplaces, etc.Picture quality is excellent. Glossy black styling is very hip. All in all, a solid value."
5,Compact & Simple,I am a REALTOR in Lexington SC and this is a great camera for my work. The wide angle is great in taking picture of rooms. I have used stiching programs and the results sometimes come out distorted. It saves me time from editing my pics for my virtual tours. The movie mode is fantastic. Not the greatest resolution but good enough to create a dvd on the Mac. I have used it to take a video of my home listing for the wife of my client who wasn't able to come and see the home. Mailed her a dvd of the home and a day later we have an offer on the home! This camera just paid for itself. The wide angle is great for family reunion pictures. Now no one is left out.
1,BOYS BECOMING GIRLS,"FEELINGS are more important than PERFORMANCEWHAT?In Sports, competition is natural. Competition makes you stronger.- If you aren't good enought to be on an All-Star team, practice more, try harder, learn to learn and improve yourself.Have fun. Try hard. Do your best."
5,Language of the Heart,A really lovely CD from a really lovely Christian singer. Janet has the most beautiful voice.
5,WONDERFUL,EACH AND EVERY SONG IS STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SING IS WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT YOURSELF AND IT SHOWS IN JANET'S SINGING.
2,Flimsy roller frame,"I had used this product a decade ago and was very satisfied. The new roller frames are plastic, flimsy and cracked in half before the room was finished (I had painted only one wall). Not a good product in my view."
3,It does what it says but with a lot of effort.,"I liked the roller, but it takes quite a bit of work to get the pattern on the wall. The rollers are just made of foam and don't hold a lot of paint. The pattern that results looks like marble but it's too busy for me. The rag rollers produce about the same effect, but don't require as much work as they hold more paint."
3,wall magic marble roller covers,"I had this product when it originally came out 15 or so years ago. I loved it then. The new model is now foam and doesn't hold up nearly as well as the old type roller. The sponges seem to be coming off the roller as I used it. Also I could not make the application as lightly as I needed to uniformly. The walls I painted did turn out amazing, but it took a lot more effort than the old type rollers did."
1,Flunked out,"This is very possibly THE worst album i have ever listened to .I was expecting powerful Funk rock , somewhere along the lines of Funkadelic but heavier. And i blame the reviewers who praised it so highly as just that. Its terrible, over here in the UK this would be saturday morning POP music. I have tried hard to find something anywhere near Funkadelic or similar, alas in vain.I love the combination of Funk Rock but this aint it at all , not even close. These people should give up .Also the biggest laugh is some jerk reviewer( who knows ) thinks its good , i despair of you yankee chappies i mean you know very little of what rock is all about . Just leave it to us ."
1,"""Anybody who loves great music should probably skip this disc""","Difficult to understand the enthusiasm of the 5 reviews here so far. I agree with James Leonard at AMG, who concludes that ""Anybody who loves great music should probably skip this disc."""
5,Matcless or Mission Top Secret a 1967 classic spy spoof,"A classic and old spy movie where an ex-Koeran War veteran Patrick O'Neal now a free lancewriter goes on a mission for the government to recover a Secret formula and ends up in a Chinese prison where he meets an old Chinese ""monk"" who gives him a special secret ring with magical properties.Some old classic actors you may recognize when they were very young,Lot's of fun and probably a b movie, but worth it's weight in gold as a classic.Loved it very much.The color is a little faded, but maybe they will enhance it digitally?Download it from Amazon Instant Movies. Always a good bet.Enjoy it. Not as good as The Man From U.N.C.L.E., but very realistic ""politically"".Always be careful what you wish for or get into with the Government. It is usually not very good.I know, I was former USSS."
4,Everything FITS!,"I own the Canon VIXIA HFS100, and this fits the camcorder, extra battery, charger, and even my point and shoot digital canon. Great case."
2,Not very custom.,"I was very disappointed in the case. I do not see anything custom about as to fitting my video camera, which it allegedly is made for. The camera fits ok but most small video cameras would also fit in it. It's cloth with a little padding and a bottom insert which lifts out. You have to take everything out of the case to get anything out of the bottom. I assume the bottom storage is for cables. I could have done better with a generic case which this is in my opinion."
4,"Not what I expected, but it'll do","After reading all the reviews about how large this bag is I was expecting to be able to put the kitchen sink in the left side pocket. It's bigger than necessary for my Vixia HF G10, but the extra length provides a nice little pocket on the other side of the adjustable divider for the removable lens hood. In the zippered pockets I put all of the cords, adapters, and little extras and still have room left over for more stuff as it accumulates. If you're worried about it being too big, read the dimension specs and measure it off. As for me, the only problems that I have with it is that it's overpriced and whoever made this for Canon couldn't even bother to sew the Canon name tag on straight. I think just as nice of a bag could be had for half the price if you knew what you were getting."
1,A bit too much...,"Our Canon 500 swims in this case. Too big, too much, just too much going on here. Not sleek at all, simply screams ""I'm a big camcorder bag with an expensive camera in here - please steal me?"" I rather wrap up my camera in an old tshirt than use this dinosaur of a bag."
4,Canon SC2000 Soft Carrying Case,"Nice case, lots of roomy pockets and dividers including a ""shelf"" for the loved ""basement"" section."
2,TOO LONG!,"This set is SIX HOURS. Who edited this, man? It's probably one hour total of Ronnie in the gym, one hour of him eating, and four hours of close-ups on his cars, his clothes, his shoes, etc. This documentary should not have been longer than two or two and a half hours. They show this man cook his burgers with excruciating detail, like five minutes.Don't get me wrong, if you want to see him in his everyday life, you see everything, so this is for you.Ronnie seems like a good guy though. I'd like this dvd a lot more if they just did some EDITING!"
4,Good video but Unbelievable was far more superior.,"Ronnie Coleman ""Unbelievable"" dvd was by far a better video. ""Relentless"" is good but a lot of mundane stuff that made the video a bit boring and make you want to say ""big deal?"" I did enjoy his workouts, watching him practically do superhuman feats. But overall, I enjoyed it. The road just before Mr Olympia was just a blip in the video. Too bad they couldn't show part of the footage. Also, Ronnie has really done well for himself, he has 4 cars and an SUV (Escalade). One of his car is a 2 door/seater Bentley."
4,BEST JOKEBOOK I'VE READ IN YEARS,"Whoever selected the jokes for this book really knows what's funny. The title means ""laugh out loud"" and I did on a number of occasions. In fact, my wife wanted to know why I was laughing in the bathroom. Some of the introductions to the various chapters are almost as funny as the jokes themselves. I recommend this book for anyone who likes to laugh -- and who doesn't?"
4,an anthology of jokes that have appeared on the internet,"EVERYONE HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO A JOKE LIST ONLINE, YOU KNOW THE JOKES YOU READ AND SEND WHEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING. THE TROUBLE IS,MOST OF THESE JOKES ARE EITHR LAME, OR SO OLD, YOUR GRANDFATHER KNEW THEM. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT THE LAME AND SENSELESS ONES ARE ELIMINATED AND THE GOOD ONES ARE CATAGORIZED. ALOT OF THEM ARE TIMELY, SUBJECTS THAT WE CAN ALL RELATE TO. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK, AND IT IS GREAT TOILET READING MATERIAL."
5,IT WILL INDEED MAKE YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD,"I not only laughed out loud, but sometimes till the tears rolled. LOL is the perfect antidote for a gloomy mood and it's a great bottle-of-wine alternative for hostess gifts. I heartily recommend it for everyone with a vital funny-bone."
5,Very funny stuff,"I was skeptical about this book when I first saw it... after all, why would I pay for jokes, however good, that I could get for free on the net? Then my wife pointed put, ""Because the people who made our toilet forgot to include a laptop!"" I bought it for reading in the, uh, places I don't have computer access... and it's great!"
5,Best Laughs Of 2001,I just got this book and will be sending one to my son for Christmas. I know he will laugh as much as I did! Laughter is the best medicine and all of us need a bit of this medicine everyday. This book is a treasure trove of laughing matter. I hope Steve and Patty collect enough new jokes to publish another. They certainly did a good job on this one. It's gets 5 stars in my book!
1,Inappropriate for Children,The content of this book should be R-rated. It is completely inappropriate for children and the book description does not capture the adult nature of the humor.
5,Tracks are...,"1. Good Bait2. Blue 'N' Boogie3. Dizzy Atmosphere4. Salt Peanuts5. I Can't Get Started6. Hot House7. Shaw 'Nuff8. 'Round About Midnght9. Dizzy Boogie10. Night In Tunesia11. Ol' Man Rebop12. Anthropology13. Ooh Bop Sh'Bam14. One Bass Hit (Part 1)15. That's Earl, Brother"
3,Ambivalent,"My son loves the pictures in this classic board book, but I have misgivings. I don't appreciate Scarry's stereo-typed portrayals of mothers and fathers: his mommies are always in the kitchen, while the daddies do the yardwork, males drive vehicles, females play with dolls, etc. It mucks up an otherwise good book."
4,Mundial Small Cutlery Case,"This was a gift for my son, so I have no other comments other than he seemed very pleased with the gift. He was happy that it was a hard-sided case and well made."
4,A Winning Album,"Solid Isley Brothers Album with there Trademark Vocals,Organ&Fire Hot Guitar Licks from Ernie Isley who still is sadly Underrated.this Band in the Studio to Me was as Bad as anyone out there during the same time period.between the Solos&Vocals you can't go wrong a Good Blend of Funk&Slow-Jams.One of the Few Acts from back in the day still on the scene."
3,"""The Start of their Downfall!""","It was an ok album, but it was a bit too much. To me the Isley's were not double album artist, and I think that's where this fails. Don't get me wrong, there is still high quality songs, both funk and roll, and very good ballads. But the balance is primarily gone, and it feels like one big mess. This would be the start of the downfall of the 3+3 unit."
1,Trite,"This book is, put crudely, hog wash. It is as not ""original"" or enlightening in any sense. It is watery and lacks substance or even basic analysis. If you want to understand history in this innovative manner Marcus claims to present then take a intro to sociology class. Nothing in this book even worths mentioning."
3,Meh.,"Tribute Trail isn't a bad read, but the authors just don't deliver on the promising set-up. Kherin, a prince and mage, is betrayed and sold into slavery in a foreign land, where he befriends the new ruler of a warrior culture, eventually becoming his lover and teaching him to wield his own gifts. There are lots of threats and dangers, most of which just kind of unravel or are left hanging in the end. People and plots are left half-developed. And if you're looking for hot, sexy moves, you won't find them here. The descriptions of intimacy are very vague."
4,We need more music like this!,"I gave this album a four-star rating because one or two of the songs aren't great, but overall, it's very good. Sergio had a way of taking hits and making them even better. Witchita Lineman and Norwegian Wood are a couple of examples. If you are a fan of his earlier work, you should be pleased with this.By the way, why is it that it takes a Japanese company to produce many of these old A & M albums?"
4,Great american pop and latin mix,During the late 60's as america looked for an escape from the the news of war and violence they turned toward latin music.Artist like sergio mendes and herb alpert came out with music that mixed latin music with american pop.This album came out in 1969 when the interest in latin music started to wane and was not as popular as earlier albums by Brazil 66.My favorite songs are Wichita lineman with it's great vocal arrangment and YE-ME-LE.Both of these songs were performed on the tv show music scene and are available on dvd.
1,"Nothing ""Extended"" about it","This is the Sykes/Gorham Lizzy ""One Night Only"" show with several songs missing and in a different order."
3,"A review of this edition, not the masterpiece","I won't bother to review Dante's ""Divine Comedy"". The fact that it has withstood the test of time, and its depicitions of heaven and hell have become ingrained into our mythology, reveal far more than anything I could say.This translation, however, was simply too difficult to read. It was too full of ""thees"" and ""thous"", and quite frankly did not flow at all. Reading it was a real struggle for me. The annotation and Canto introductions, however, were very helpful, and gave me a better picture of what Dante was saying than the actual text itself. The book also has the advantage of being compact (all three parts in one average-sized book), and reasonably priced.However, I would recommend searching for a translation written in a more modern style, so that Dante's message isn't obscured in a linguistic haze. What he said was too important to be lost in a struggle with the langauge."
3,cousin interested in literaure,I purchased this for a cousin. He heard about the book in school and was talking about it. He loves it. Took him only 3 days to read it.
2,"Leave all hope, ye that enter","I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing. What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy. This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga. Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent. In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell. Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter'"
3,read it if you must,"possibly the most overrated work of literature in the western cannon. Dante in his writings emerge as a provincial moralist. The tale is tedious at best, the Inferno being the most readable of the three parts.Read this work if you feel morally and culturally obligated, but not for enjoyment."
5,World's Greatest Seasoning,"This is the world's greatest seasoning. I call it my ""Jalapeno Salt"" because it is much like Lawry's Seasoned Salt except that it uses Jalapeno peppers instead of Paprika/Tumreric/etc. like Lawry's does. This seasoning is perfect on a wide range of dishes like grilled chicken, popcorn, tater tots and taco meat.However, I must warn you that the 8oz canister is really a 6oz canister. So it may be hard for some people to justify the $11 (including shipping as of 01/12) price tag for this can of seasoning."
4,highly reccommended!,"this book is a great, funny, scary and descriptive book, although it's not scary it a Great book! i highly recommend this book and recommend you to try it!"
2,"cunning, funny, & just plain weird","This book was pretty good. I expected it to be better, though. The best part was when the beasts showed up. It describes them perfectly. The game that the beasts play is pretty funny. The part that got me confused is the ending. It leaves you with many questions."
5,Cool!,"I think this is one of his best books. Some of them i don't think are scary and suspensful, or read it once and think they were pretty good, but not great. This one is soo suspenseful I couldn't put it down. I LOVE IT!"
5,Garrett's beast review,"The Beast From The East is a wonderful book! She gets lost in WY. They live in Rapid, SD. Ginger is a ten year old girl that gets lost in the woods with her brothers, Pat and Nat. She meets some beasts called Fleg, Spork, and Gleeb, and they play a game. If you're it in the end , you get fried. Fleg and the other beasts went to hide. Nat and Ginger had to find them. Finally they saw a beast and they went to find it. But he was not there. What will they do? This book is for all readers because the words are easy. ""This book is good,""I think."
3,Pretty good book,I like this book because i like books wich they play tag and if they lose they get eaten
1,Works but with limited efficiency.,"I found Trombotine slide cream to be less effective than other products I have used. It is very difficult to avoid applying an excessively thick layer of the cream when working with a professional level instrument such as the King 2B. This results in a very sluggish slide response. Trombotine might be best suited for well worn slides or slides with less precision than a professional level instrument. The viscosity seems ""thicker"" than slide creams which perform better."
2,"Did not work with my 1/4"" pegboard","I've used similar peg locks with my 1/4"" pegboard with no problems, but these ones do not work - the locks fall out as they are too loose.Maybe they work better with 1/8"" pegboard, but that's not what I have."
3,it was OK,"The ""32"" pieces were quite small, and most of those pieces were to keep the pegs in place, there are NOT 32 steel pegs."
5,GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book is amazing. The writing style and word choice is superb buy this book immediately
5,GREAT COLLECTABLE,"THIS DOLL IS A GREAT COLLECTABLE. IF YOU COLLECT BARBIE'S, HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT THE CARNAVAL BARBIE? THE COSTUME AND MAKEUP IS TERRIFIC. I COLLECT ALL ETHNIC BARBIES AND THIS IS A SURE WINNER."
3,"I KNOW THAT THE DOLL WILL VARY A BIT,BUT NOT LIKE THIS!","Every year, the city of Rio de Janeiro erupts in a frenzy of music, dance, sequins, and feathers while the Cariocas (local inhabitants) and countless visitors celebrate carnaval! In tribute to Rio de Janeiro's joyous, week-long celebration, Barbie doll wears an incredible Brazilian costume featuring a bright purple outfit with a striking, midriff baring halter top and a short skirt. Golden platform shoes and a fabulous headpiece complete the hot-hot-hot ensemble.Thats the description of the barbie.Not educational.This is what a barbie would wear if she went to the celebration.NOT THE PEOPLE THEMSELFS.I would only give it 3 stars.the shoes wont stay on.the clothes DO NOT COME OFF,dont try it,want to remove clothes on this doll,cant.Main reason I bought em.SO aint good for little kids.better for PINK LABEL collectors.but gorgeous."
2,Simple and Sweet,"For musical theatre fans only.a clean recording, that sound clean. A typical first run musical, with a top notch effort from the cast and production team, just no where near the standards of off Broadway.its only worth one listen."
3,A Mixed Bag,"It's okay. Nice to have a small original musical, but it's uneven musically and lyrically and hard to follow the story."
5,Wonderful Stove Top,Installed this top in our rv and wow what a difference easy to install within mintues you have a new looking kitchen close adds extra counter space and great price and packaging was great didnt come with directions to install but easy pull out stove enough to install 5 screws to back edge of countertop behind stove and push stove back in and your done that easy
5,Must Have For The RV,"All RV owners know about limited counter top space. This is a simple and effective solution. Mounting is simple. However, you may need to be a little creative. I needed to have the hinge face inward when mounting on a Magic Chef oven/stove in a 2011 rig because this stove's backside ridge precluded the easier hinge outward configuration. After drilling 2 holes, I had a tight fitting and attractive stove top which effectively doubled my counter area."
5,Good buy...,Exactly as advertised. Fit perfectly. easy to install. Gave me alot more counter space. Would recommend to anybody. Reasonably priced.
3,Only for non-recessed stoves.,"I had a new range put in our RV, and I thought that this cover would work. The only problem is if you have a range that is recessed in to the counter top, this cover will not work. You can not open the cover completely, so I had to return it."
2,didn't fit as pictured.,Didn't work on my stove even after I put in measurements. Still didn't work too small. Needs small stove to work.
3,Too Small,"This was way too small for our Frigidaire gas oven. Take your measurements, it's not universal. This had to go back."
1,Change Address,"Hi, once the product has a long time to arrive, I''d like to change the address of the shipment or even cancel the order. Is it possible ? I'll leave the address I gave you on March 6 and won't back before March 2012.Feel free to cotact me.liliane.noga@e-skynet.com.br"
4,If you like Bill Laswell...,"...you'll enjoy this album. As all his relases, this is very high quality music that you can listen to over an over and hear something different each time. A must buy for any Laswell fan."
5,Best Laswell disc I own,"Granted... I have only heard snippets of mp3's, bought Imaginary Cuba (letdown), and Sacred System, Chapter 2 (letdown... but barely). Still, this one is great. I'm still checking out the others!"
2,waste of time,"The plot is very slow, and not in a good way that lets it unwrap and draw you in. It simply lacks any kind of substance in terms of dialogue and it drags."
2,Female identification film,This film is neither romantic nor a comedy. Two New York women spend their time being condescending and denigrating toward men. One decides she wants a baby so opts for artificial insemination. Then through stealth finds out who the doner father is and stalks him. The film overall proves that women do not know what they want nor what they are doing and that they pretty much resent the fact that they actually need a man in their lives. More of a disillusioned chick flic than anything else.
5,The good deal,I purchased the Insten battery to use in my Nikon D70. I have so far not been able to tell a major difference between this and the orginal battery pack except for the price. I definitely recommend.
3,Mediocre with bits of brilliance,"One of Taylor's later efforts.It has a couple of lovely songs with Taylor's signature harmonies - and they're really great.But a fair amount of filler.""I Will Not Lie"" is a gem."
3,Underrated Gem,"Flag is one of those JT albums that no one ever mentions much anymore. With the core of his great old band (Kunkel, Sklar, Kootch), it has some wonderful tunes that FM radio played way back when. My favorites: Sleep Come Free Me, Millworker, and Company Man (featuring a terrific harmony with Graham Nash).The real tragedy about this album isn't that it never got its due. Those who love JT know this album and probably have it in their collections. Rather, the concert video that came out shortly afterwards and featured the tour to promote the album is no longer available. The Flag tour was one of the last that featured the ""core"" of JT's old band (including Waddy Wachtel and David Sanborn for this particular tour)."
4,"Beautiful, lovely, but would like a different clasp","The set is absolutely gorgeous in person, and I'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster. The clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design, and it's incredibly secure when fastened; however, it's difficult to maneuver and I can't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on - or get it off - without assistance. That's the only reason I wouldn't give this five stars - the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great."
4,Simply a must-have for the serious CT fan!,The book tells it all from the group's beginning to their most recent album with all the trials and tribulations they've endured. Plenty of trivia for each album i.e. a picture of Rick's wife on one of the album covers. Want to know which one? Read the book. You won't be disappointed!
5,Thank God for Mike Hayes & Ken Sharp!,"As a long time fan of Cheap Trick, I consider RIAFT to be THE Cheap Trick Bible. It is full of information about the band. Anyone who knows the band well is aware of the fact that they like to keep their private lives private and Mike and Ken respect that. I refer to this book all the time and keep it handy. It is also full of never before seen early photos of the band. You might also like to know that I tried to order this book originally through Amazon and they accepted my order only to tell me that they could not obtain it. That is ridiculous as Mike Hayes actually helped me (and many other fans) obtain this book directly through Ken Sharp. Afterward I informed Amazon that it is available through Ken Sharp and my email to them fell on deaf ears."
4,A Good Refrence book for Dylan Fans,"This is a good reference book for Dylan fans. It has no analysis or commentary and just an occasional opinion. At times the details may seem a little excessive, but the information is not too expansive as to be overwhelming (I can't say the same for some other Dylan books)."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with these rollers - all they did was soak up paint and when I tried to rollthem on the wall, the paint just squirted all over. I would not recommend these to anyone.The foam rollers work much better."
5,You aint a gammer till you've beaten it,"It all started here, with this game. This was the beginning of the first person shooters. Playing it and sticking with it till the end well it's like tracing your roots, going to Macca and all that. There is something about the sounds of the doors as they open and close, the loneliness of cells that I return back to this game every 3 or 4 years. It centers me and it's fun killing those Nazi guy's. You have got to try it."
4,Noplex,"Wolfenstien is always fun, and the coming of the new game just makes it better to play. I can still remember playing it on my old 90mhz computer =\ those were the days.And for the person who posted above, Duke Nukem 3D works fine in Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows XP, just go out to the store and buy it... including the many paks =\"
1,It sucks,"This game is stupid. It makes my stomach hurt to play it. It reminds me of some random Sunday afternoon in the middle of summer when the sun is setting sitting in some old dusty single-wide in Central Georgia right next to a cotton field with no one else there except some big fat nasty woman named Louise, and she's wearing some cloth black shorts and some nursing home looking t-shirt and flip-flops."
5,A very highly recommended original source material for Native American Studies collections,"Translated for the first time from the original Dutch into English, Montana 1911: A Professor And His Wife Among The Blackfeet presents the diary of Wilhelmina Uhlenbeck, the wife of anthropologist and linguist C. C. Uhlenbeck, who traveled to Montana to conduct fieldwork among the southern Piegan Indians. Her diary is reproduced in full, chronicling her perspective of the three-month stay, and also thoroughly supplemented with notes, an introduction to Blackfeet and their mythology, a biographical sketch of the couple, and a selection of the writings of C. C. Uhlenbeck that parallel the text from his wife's diary. Black-and-white vintage photographs illustrate this remarkable hands-on, up-close and personal perspective of Native American daily life and culture. Montana 1911 is a very highly recommended original source material for Native American Studies collections."
4,Simple and Practical,"The pros on this knife are that it is simple, having the basics I wanted- knife, screwdriver, bottle opener, and nothing else that I'll never use and have to lug around. You can clip it on a belt loop or wear it in its case on your belt, its well built, beautifully designed and thoughtfully put together making it comfortable in your hand and easy to open the blade single handed (if you're right handed) because of a small thumb bolt on the blade. The cons are that its too bulky for a pocket knife, and the two double headed screwdriver inserts will slip out of their holder if you are reasonably active and wear the knife clipped and hanging from a belt loop. I just duct taped them secure seeing as I use the blade the most and prefer having it outside my pocket for quick access."
1,Bloody Awful,"This might ave been a good movie, had it had more money spent on it.Unfortunately its shortcomings are all too obvious. The acting is beyond cretinous, the camerawork shoddy, and the picture grainy and wobbly.Sound is also chronic in parts with voice sound volume decreasing abruptly when actors walk away from the boom mike.Although the gore is plenteous and quite well delivered, it seemed that Mr Cavalline was just direcing a series of horrific scenes to shock.There was no cohesion and it came across like he was trying just that bit too hard. There is not much (if any)storyline, so all in all not a success.I'd recommend this film to horror boneheads who can understand gore when they see it, but would be confused by any semblance of plot or realistic acting. Strictly Amateur Hour i'm afraid.PS Ignore Todd Proesl's review. Not only does he ""act"" in this film, he is the worst ""actor"" in the entire thing."
1,meh,"You could go out and buy 100 other movies just like this if you wanted to. Nothing new, nothing original. I'm not saying someone out there wouldn't like it but for me it was a waste of time to be honest"
5,Outstanding,"A must read for every serious law student and attorney - even if you are an experienced brief writer, this easy to understand book, filled withe clear examples forces you to think and improve your persuasive writing."
2,Needs to take his own advice,"It amazes me that those who teach legal writing always advocate simplicity, but usually fail to follow their own advice. This author writes in one or two paragraphs what can be said in one or two sentences. Perhaps he is being paid 'by-the-word' rather than by content?If you want to learn how to write short, to-the-point sentences, take a class in journalism and news writing. If you want to learn how to write a persuasive brief, go to the appellate court files and read the briefs written by those who have consistently won reversals on appeal."
3,Helpful but won't have time for it,"The book looks helpful at first glance but we'll see what happens when the semester gets rolling and it matters. I usually find that buying these books is an inevitable trap I fall into with disappointing results. But, in all fairness I haven't given this book much of a shot yet. Amazon is excellent - obviously."
5,Must Have,"This book is a classic; a ""must have"" for anyone who drafts briefs. If you're going to take the time to document a persuasive argument, do it right."
4,no title,"I don't want to write a review, I want to know what the book story line is, I think I read this book in the past but would like to know for sure before I order it."
2,Not for the layman,I collect and repair audio equipment.I wanted a book to help me delve further into diagnosing problems and testing individual components.This book didn't do it.Way too many item specific examples and not enough general testing information.
5,Good Book,It is a good book to hellp learn to repair audio equipment. It is good to keep to refer back to for future times.
4,Its a book,Need some reference to electronics then buy it that's about all I can say about this book and it has allot of pages....
3,Suncast Swivel Hose Hideaway,Worked great until it broke and started leaking.The water connection came apart spewing water everywhere. Tried pushing it back together but would not work. Still leaking like crazy.Don't know if it was just a defect in this one or not. Have another model by suncat and it has worked with no problems.
2,Not what I thought it was,"When I purchased this litter I thought it was going to be a clumping litter. It is NOT. It says on the bag that its a clay litter but its not like a clay that I've ever seen before. Its white and blue and doesnt clump and my cats dont like it either. If you're looking for a clumping litter, definitely do NOT purchase this. I was very disappointed and now have to buy more littler."
4,Purchasing Careers,"Opportunities in Purchasing offers a discussion of the transition in the field. The book describes the functions of the department, the importance of purchasing and the organization of companies. Described are purchasing positions and opportunities in the field. Included is changes to computerization, strategies, and centralization versus decentralization. Included is a University listing of purchasing programs, salary information and interviews with purchasing executives."
2,Badly made book,"This is a great translation of the Commentary, and is laid out in a very helpful manner as far as having the original text together with the commentary. The book, however, is very poorly made for the price. The ink rubs off easily even with one's thumb, much less and eraser, and the binding is weak. The spine on mine broke after a few months of careful use and the pages are beginning to come loose there. I own a few other books in the commentary series (De Anima, Ethics, Posterior Analytics) and they are all similarly of poor quality. I recommend the text(s) highly, I do not recommend buying this book new. If I was doing it again I would save myself a few dollars and buy it used and not expect a good-quality book."
3,Zinkl - 'Lovely Night Creatures' (Prudence),"Believe this might be only the second Prudence-label release I've ever reviewed. Zinkl is a 'new age' electronic artist based out of Munich,Germany. For some odd reason(s),his CD covers were the main reason my attention were ever even drawn toward his work. Zinkl's influences range from European classical to British progressive. A couple of tunes here I thought showed some promise were the laid back title track ""Lovely Night Creatures"",""Dark Hope"" and ""Blind Sessions"" was pretty decent. Problem is I can't THINK of a single other band or artist I could honestly compare him to. Good chill out music to listen to late at night,when you're 'in the mood' for something different."
5,ACCOUNTING EXCELLENCE,"We have purchased this for our own use and for the use of family members in the Accounting profession. If you are an accountant, this is a MUST."
1,Bob Dylan : The Karaoke Version,"I suppose my title tells it all. While I would go the distance to purchase a new Dylan item to listen to - this live recording at Budkoan leaves me nauseous. I am left wondering what Dylan and/or his promoters, were thinking about when they came up with this musical format. The 'up tempo' musical background coupled with Dylan's attempt to join in by adding his own uptemp vocal elements put simply, destroys the poetry of his songs! This is one live concert to be avoided - even by the collector!!!"
1,Just awful,"I am a Dylan freak, really hard core, but this album is an embarassment. Not quite as wretched as Saved or Self Portrait, but pretty doggone close. Save your money, and buy Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61, Blood on the Tracks, or Desire. If you want a live album, try Before the Flood."
1,The nadir of Dylan's career,"I could never finish listening to this album. Dylan butchered and bastardized his songs so badly here that it made the album unlistenable. After getting partway through side three on the cassette version, I tossed it into the trash can. Like another reviewer said, Dylan has every right to re-write his songs, but to do it in such a shoddy manner is almost unforgiveable. I would give this album no stars, but it wasn't on the rating scale. The quicker this LP goes out of print, the better. Bob Dylan does not need to be remembered for this abberation."
1,bob dylan's at budokan concert,"bob's concert ""a budokan"".Tape was missing eleven songs.sent a couple of emails;receivingno reply but was refunded.thank you forrefund, jayne"
2,only for the true fan,"this is by far dylans worst live album (at least among those that have been offically released). he messes with all of his songs and changes them almost beyond recognition to very ill effect. however, this is still an interesting cd. it characterizes the way dylan was constantly reinventing himself, and for that reason is fun to have as something of a collector's item. usually, however, he reinvented himself into a better or different but equally as good performer. here, he is just terrible.if you are a big dylan fan i would buy this cd just because it IS interesting. however, the music itself is pretty dreadful, just force yourself to suffer through it."
3,Do not buy this album if you don't really like Dylan,"When I first bought this album, I couldn't stand it. After about two years, I brought it down from the shelves and I still hated it, but not as much. Now I actually listen to it sometimes as i go to sleep, and for that, I really enjoy it. And the flute has actually grown on me, but I'm glad he never used it again. I also like the versions of Simlple Twist of Fate and Love Minus Zero and All I Really Want To Do and a few others. I was in Jamaica when I first started liking it, so maybe that has something to do with it."
2,not worth it for a few good songs,"When I first got this album I couldn't stand how Dylan butchered songs like ""Don't think twice, Mr. Tambourine Man, and The Times they are a-changin'"". The sax is great, but who wants to hear Dylan with a sax? The background vocals have to go! However, this version of ""All along the Watchtower"" is one of my personal favorites. ""Shelter from the Storm"" is pretty decent too."
2,Should have stayed in Las Vegas,"There's not much to say about this album, other than whenever I hear it I immediately picture Dylan in a scraggly beard singing to a bunch of depressed folks aimelessly shoving coins into slot machines in a seedy Las Vegas casino. Probably the most hillarious song on here is ""Ain't Gonna Work on Maggie's Farm No More."" It's almost worth buying the album just to hear this song. ""Shelter from the Storm"" is actually not half-bad, but that's about it. Don't buy this cd."
3,For true fans,"Recorded live, not studio, so quality of sound differs. Arrangements are different from standard versions. If you are a true Dylan fan you will appreciate this but if you are a casual Dylan fan and prefer studio recordings, and funds are limited, add this to your collection at a later date."
5,Amazing rewrites!,"I listen with astonishment at the man's ability to rewrite his own songs and to sing with passion. He has more pathos than any greek. Excellent concert, great saxaphone."
2,"Sure It's Interesting, But Even That Wears Off","I bought this album on vinyl when it was released, at the same time as I was exploring some of the classic Dylan albums. For some reason, I could never bring myself to play the second LP--I just got bored with the whole thing halfway through. There are some good moments scattered throughout--I like ""One More Cup of Coffee"" and its sax solo; ""Love Minus Zero"" is catchy; ""I Want You"" is a beautiful reading of what was a throwaway ""pop song"" (tho' still one of my favourite Dylan tunes)--and there are a few other highlights. But it's hardly an album to run out and buy, unless you're very interested in how Dylan reinvents himself in all his stage shows. This time out, the big sound obscures the lyrics, without the glamour and myth of the Rolling Thunder shows. This album was a mistake, and it's probably no accident that he ended up veering completely in another direction (""Slow Train Coming"") after this."
3,Lukewarm version in my opinion,"I spent quite a while comparing versions of the Odyssey. I tried this one for a short while before I ended up with my favorite...the Rieu! (2002 reprint/revised edition).What I like about Shewring's version is the poetic and imaginative strength he brings at times (but not throughout) to the reader. The other thing I liked was the Font style.What I didn't like was his modern stale middle of the road intellectualism. Because of his choice of wording in sentences, it lacks the raciness and grip the story NEEDS!- Try it out for yourself, compare a few different versions and see which one resonates with you more!"
5,Amazing.,"Like all Intec produts, this surpasses all the other competition. It doesn't have static overloads unless you're playing a bad game at full volume, and it fits in beautifully with your gamecube for travel, and then are easly re-conected in a hotel.This has let me hear sounds that I couldn't hear with my T.V. This will blow you away if you are into feeling like you are in the game, espesaly if you play in the dark(It's black, really helps alot)This is a must have for any serios gamer."
2,good but not good,"this is great except for the fact u could use 30 bucks ona 3-piece speaker one or spen 50 on a 4 piece on or, like i might buy, an 8-piece surround sound system for 80 bucks."
5,One of the best CD's ever released!,"1/3 Guided By Voices + 1/3 Bob Mould + 1/6 U2 + 1/6 Fig Dish = Creeper Lagoon. Plain and simple, this is one of the greatest CDs ever created. If I were stranded on an island and could somehow only get my hands on one CD, this would be a strong contender for that CD. Not only is it one of the best CDs ever, it also contains ""Wrecking Ball"", one of the greatest songs ever written. If you have any love of indie pop rock, then I can promise you that you will fall in love with this CD from the first listen, and you will always be able to put it in without getting bored. GREAT!"
1,nothing original here,"absolutely nothing stands out on this record. it's like a tom hanks movie ie. makes the masses very happy but offers no real challenge or artistic pay off. since the masses haven't caught on and they haven't exploded into rock stars, this record will be stacking up in the used bins in about 6 months."
1,generic alterna rock = bad,"ok, so there's a song that sounds a little like Third Eye Blind, there's a song that soounds a little like U2 circa joshua tree, there's a song with grungy guitar riffs a la Smashing Pumpkins. basically there's a lot of stale 80's and early 90's stuff here. i have one suggestion: throw away your chain wallets and gas station attendant jackets and join the 21st century. you guys were new like 10 years ago."
3,Under the Tracks rocks,"The song ""Under the Tracks"" is a standout perfect pop song, from O.C movie. It's a very happy song, it would be a good choice for a Hollywood cigarette theme, if cigarette ad were allowed in Brazil.The other songs are forgettable, but are some OK songs, like the slower ""Here We Are"" and ""Cellophane"" and the upbeat ""Wrecking Ball"".Some reference in Internet are assigning ""Under the Tracks"" to Coldplay. No chances."
1,Watered Down Ghost Garden,"What a let down! After the catchy/quirky Become Small & Go and the beautiful, lush Watering Ghost Garden, I had high expectations for Creeper Lagoon's new album. Well somebody (Dreamworks?) sucked the life out of it and it is a boring, tepid, weak stab at commercial top-40 stardom. Wrecking Ball should be a 'big hit' on MTV and commercial radio, but none of these songs have the bite of their earlier material. They have so much more talent and potential than is reflected on this coaster. I hope they get their mojo back for their next outing."
5,"Great band, great record, greatly overlooked......","I first heard of Creeper Lagoon on a compilation CD featuring their song ""Wrecking Ball"". What a song! I immediately loved this band and bought their CD. Many great bands over the years, with great artistic creativity, such as Creeper Lagoon, very often go overlooked by mainstream promoters and therefore are virtually unknown. Too bad for those people who don't search out great new alternative rock and shame on the mainstream morons who run the music business like a flower shop. Creeper Lagoon's songs are really EXCELLENT. There's something very, very catchy about each song, yet they're not superficial pop tunes that get played out after 10 spins. Just when you think C.L. will go cliche, they sharply turn the wheel to something different and pleasing. This CD demonstrates a band that's really enjoying themselves yet gives much enjoyment to their listeners. I highly recommend this CD to true rock fans."
4,Still Ripe,"Poised for major breakthrough with their Dust Bros produced debut ""I become Small and Go"" this San Francisco indie power pop band was the next slated as the next best thing by college listeners around the country. Their much anticipated major label sophomore effort ""Take Back the Universe and Give me Yesterday"" finally was released last month with a mixed reception and varied applause. Although many indie purists maintain the band has sold their dynamic and emotive guitar driven pop noodling to the Everclear's of Hellfire and corporate damnation, these San Francisco darlings no doubt have created a solid, beautiful mix of intricate guitar fueled melancholy. Mature beyond their years Creeper Lagoon is still a force to be reckoned with in the years to come even if their musical chops are laced with more corporate sheen the songwriting is still ripe and tasty in the middle."
4,Good all around blues compilation,This is a good blues CD if you're looking for one with artists spanning many decades. It has older stuff as well as some of the latest artists. I enjoyed it although some of the songs are a bit lengthy.
3,Not as good as I expected,Just another compilation that teases one into thinking it will be another good BLUES recording.
4,Not bad,"These are a bit smaller, softer, and sweeter than classic fruit sours. Very good, but I think I prefer theusual kind."
3,could not find this locally,"I use the nipples for a watering system I made, over time the nipples break and in my area the big and small stores do not carry this item."
1,How much sleep do you need?,You might as well read one chapter go to bed and say you read the whole book... the book repeats itself OVER and OVER again. Very dry and BORING
4,Fair undergraduate book,The authors skim over theories or sometimes do not name them at all but it is a standard undergrad book. I'm teaching from this edition right now and am curious as to what the newer editions are like.
1,Ugh,This is by far one of the worst books I've ever had to read. I dread every second I have to spend reading it.
5,Stop picking on Lisa,First of all this book is awesome! If you haven't read this book you should because there is a ton of action and excitment! For those of you who are picking on Lisa I would like to say that Lisa wasn't acting stupid! She was nerviouse and wouldn't you be too if you were compeeting in that show? She was also mad and wouldn't you be mad if everyone was paying attention to your horse but not caring about you or think that you are a good rider? All the people did was think that Samson did everything and I think that lisa has a right to be Nerviouse and Mad!
4,Dead Ringer ... Another Meatloaf Classic!,"For those of you who are true Meatloaf fans, or those who have enjoyed his music in the past, the ""Dead Ringer"" C.D. is a must for your collection. Classic Meatloaf, especially on the slower tunes, and Jim Steinman does some great work on this project. There are many good ballad type songs, like ""Read 'em & Weep"", ""Gonna Love Her For Both of Us"", and ""Everything is Permitted"". Also on the album is classic rock, as Meatloaf does a great job on ""Dead Ringer For Love"" and ""Peel Out"".On ""Dead Ringer For Love"", Meatloaf teams up with Cher in a great tune. How's this for classic Meatloaf lyrics ... ""rock 'n roll and brew, they don't mean a thing when I compare them next you"". This duet with Cher is worth the price of the C.D. itself!Don't let the fact that this album didn't get a lot of radio airtime fool you ... it is Meatloaf at his best and I strongly recommend it!"
4,"A ""Respectable"" Follow-up to ""Bat""","If you know the story of the next few years of Meatloaf's career after ""Bat"" in 1977, you know that these years were difficult. The 1979 attempt at a follow-up album was never made.So when I bought this CD, I didn't expect much. But, it is actually a very good CD. It isn't Steinman's best work (his worst is better than most composer's best!), but it is still fine material delivered in an excellent fashion by Meatloaf.One of my favorite moments on the CD comes at the begininning, when ""Peel Out"" start with the sound of the revving of a motorcycle's engine. Does anything else better stand as a symbol of Meatloaf and Jim Steinman!This was one of the most underrated albums of the early 1980's, and if you buy it, I think you will agree. The one negative thing I will point out is the song ""Read 'Em and Weep"". I much prefer Barry Manilow's 1983 version of it, which was also produced and directed by Steinman."
3,Dead Ringer = Dead on Arrival,"Definitely not Bat Out of Hell caliber. Another side of Meat Loaf that is a bit uncooked. Not an album that I listened to over and over, but there are a couple highlights."
2,Feh,"This album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane. Every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world. The end of 'I'm gonna love her for both of us', when he keeps saying the title with different inflections...don't you just picture Rainman rocking in a corner somewhere? And if she doesn't love him back, he'll kill her! Unless she's in bed with a group of his best friends?? No wonder 'Everything is Permitted.'This is bad. The production is bad, the tone of the guitar is godawful, Meat's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far (I know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back. I don't hold it against him, but I'm the one that has to listen to it.) The band is fine, and I like some of the actual music. It's the song titles and lyrics that are awful."
3,More Adam West than Christian Bale,"The world of Batman lends itself to the medium of short stories very well. I have only ever read one Batman novel before,Batman: No Man's Land, which took ages to get going and only featured the Batman character after the halfway point. I like stories that start up right away and none of these stories, by some of the biggest names in fiction, disappoint in that regard.What is kind of off-putting though is how 'quaint' these stories seem now. The book was published in 1989 but the stories themselves date as far back as the 50s and the technology and the way people talk feels a bit dated for those of you who are used to the more modern incarnations of the character.It hasn't put me off reading more and I understand that there are several further volumes in this series from Bantam (itself an anagram of 'Batman'). I just hope that there's less Robin next time."
3,A tilt-a-whirl look into the Dark Knight's world.,"The Further Adventures of Batman is a theme anthology and it suffers from the same problem that befalls all of its genre. Wildly uneven stories about the same subject matter. Some of the tales contained in the book edge toward the camp of the maligned television series, while others are firmly rooted in the dark gothism of Tim Burton's first two film's in the series (which this and other DC comic character anthologies were tied in with). Which story best captures the 'flavor' of Batman is, of course, highly subjective. But the story by Joe R. Lansdale was the one that struck me as the best of the lot. Recommended strictly to Batman fanatics."
2,Disappointed,"For the most part the stories are extremely boring (let me hasten to add that i've been an avid Batman fan for the last 10 years), i only gave this book 2 stars because it had batman's name on it. the stories were childish bordering on moronic, not to mention out of date (1 story had bruce wayne ordering vacuum tubes for the bat computer). another flaw is that the book focuses more on bruce wayne than on his alter ego. for persons looking for good batman prose try the further adventures of the joker by the same editor or no mans land by gregg rucka."
2,Very Childish,"I found this book in my personal collection, since it is an anthology, and I had already finished most of it, I decided to finish it. I started reading the book when I was 14 years old, I remembered being enthralled. As time passed and I have grown up, my opinions have changed. The tales told in this book are very formulmatic and childish. As I was finishing the book I would read aloud to my wife the most ridiculous passages just so I was not the only one who had to suffer. To a 12-14 year old fan of the Batman character, this would qualify as an interesting read, to a grown man who has distanced himself from the caped crusader, this is an awful collection.T"
2,Leaky,Product was cheap and now I know why. The threads on the cap are sloppy and hard to get on without cross threading. Not only that it would not seal so it's a leaker.
2,"Pretty, but not useful","So, you get what you pay for. Purchased this as a gift - more as a joke than for actual use. It looks pretty, but is packaged cheaply. It does leak."
1,LEAKS!!,"After receiving this item, I washed it out like other reviewers had said. Here, it seemed fine, however when I went to actually fill it for an event, it started leaking immediately, through a small hole on one face of it."
2,just adequate,"I suppose you get what you pay for. The price is very low. The flask looks fine. But the big weakness is the screw cap - its poor design makes it very tough to easily screw back on. It keeps wanting to go on crooked, and usually takes me several tries for the screw threads to catch properly.Shouldn't be this tough to take a simple drink."
1,Piece of ...,I dropped this thing the very first time I used it and it cracked at the bottom. It's absolutely useless!
1,leaks,"I bought this as a present. The first time it was used, it leaked. It seems to close all the way, but fluid still came out. Looks good, but completely useless if it cannot be used."
1,It does leak,"The first thing I did with this flask was fill it with water, tighten the cap snugly, and shake it towards my hand. Water came out. That's the kind of flask you're looking at here. It's not even the threading on the cap, either; it leaks where the neck meets the body. When I squeeze the flask a little, water bubbles out from there. The box it came in was undamaged, so the leak must have been due to plain old shoddy manufacturing. That's what I get for trying to be too cheap. I'll be recycling this one and spending a bit more on the next one.Update: I bought a replacement flask on eBay for about $10 that appears to be identical to this one. This new one, though, doesn't leak, which leads me to believe that these particular flasks are probably just hit or miss and you'll either get a great deal or a worthless paperweight."
4,Simple flask @ good price,"Nothing special about this flask. It does its job and seems to be sturdy enough for occasional usage. It won't be passed down to your grandchildren, but for the price, it is a great buy. Comes with funnel. Made in China."
2,Stainless Flask,Flask is cheap. Guess you get what you pay for. Some of the caps were bent and didn't seal tight. I ordered 6 flasks and 3 were in good shape.
2,A Reason for the Sale?,"At least some of these flasks seem to have a leaking problem. It seems that after the pieces were assembled, the weld was ground too far, creating gaps. Otherwise, they look nice and have smooth function."
4,Quality Flask,"It is a good quality flask. It is larger than most typical flasks, so it is harder to conceal it. I hollowed out a book and put mine in it and it fit, barely. The more you put in it, the better it is right?Another reviewer said it came with a funnel, but I did not get one. It could be the distributor that I bought mine from.I would recommend it if you want a larger flask."
1,let down,"I bought this flask and I was very disappointed. This is because it was leaking!! There was a very small leak at the bottom of the flask. Overnight, it would be stuck to the counter in the morning. I then contacted Jillian Leather, and in turn they responded, but never did anything about it. I was very disappointed with the flask and the customer service."
2,Funnels nice but flask is useless,"item shipped fast but when i looked at the bottom there was a small gash, i poured water in it and it poured out a hole in the bottom. ill use the funnel but the flask can not be of use if its dripping. not all of the flasks have a hole in them but if you order this theres a small chance there might be, just sayin'"
3,Worth 80 cents but won't last,"I bought this and it lasted me for only one semester. The cap ended up coming off so I couldn't use it any more. But believe me, it got more than 80 cents worth of use. It's a good size too since it's equivalent almost 5.5 shots."
2,Just Don't Drop It,"I barely got this flask in the mail & it's broken. By the 3rd week I had it, it was filled, fell from a chair I shouldn't had left unattended, & the bottom corner cracked. Luckily I didn't put it in my pocket because it leaked out all of Gin. If you do decide to buy this product, [...] foot around this wimpy flask. It ain't for the hardcore."
1,leakage,"bought this a while back, had a pretty significant leak. Used some super glue to patch it up. It was a gift so this was not ideal."
3,2 out of 3,"I have bought 3 of these flasks. Two of them are fine, one leaks. Nice size. Not worth returning since I would have to pay for shipping."
2,Hole in flask,Looks nice. Except for the tiny hole along the upper edge. Not so surprising considering the price. Will try again.
5,Cheap and Solid,Looking for a quick and cheap way to carry around alcohol to those odd parties and events. This did the trick. I didn't experience any leakage as mentioned in other reviews and the flask works well.The cap is a little cheap feeling but I can't complain because it was only 4 bucks!For the price it is great.
4,Surprising...,"I must say that I am impressed by this album. The only real term that comes to mind is pure Gothenburg. There is really not that much to say. Though Hollenthon is no Tristania or Therion, there are many stand out tracks on this album. ""To Kingdom Come"" is by far the best track on the album and ""Fire up the Blade"" is another great track. This is by far one of the best ""one man bands"" out there. I would really reccomend this to anyone who really is interested in black metal in the vein of Cradle of Filth and Tristania. This isn't really the best album that has been released in the genre, but it is worht picking up...-BM"
5,BIG ... epic ..Insanely awesome..DEATH TO FALSE METAL!,"This is a big album. Not the length but the through the roof compositions. I might go as far as to say it is as epic as Luca Turilli..Prophet of the last eclipse, my favorite album. Hollenthon comes close. Martin Schirenc is the mastermind behind the guitar,keyboard,bass,and vocals(shared with his wife who also wrote the lyrics).Mike Groeger did the drums and percussion. Y Draig Goch(translates in welch to the red dragon)and Fire Upon the Blade are immediate standout tracks. Anyway,do yourself a favor and do not let your brain turn to mush listening to mainstream,money making,non-artistic shizzle. Purchase this album and sleep easier knowing you are now full of hardcore awesomeness."
5,amazing,"What is most difficult to grasp about this band is that it really isn't a ""band"" at all but rather the brainchild of one person. All instruments (with the exception of drums -- and a 19 second solo on one song) are played by Martin Schrenc (not sure on the spelling). All vocals with the exception of some well placed female vocals (his wife by the way)and use of samples for the chior, are again by Martin. This cd is amazing to listen to. The other reviews pretty much cover the styles of metal on the cd but what they fail to mention is that the production -- again by Martin -- is also excellent -- the entire cd was recorded in a studio in his house! I was vaguely reminded of older Therion (Theli era) but it would be oversimplifying things to say that this band sounds like any other. Buy the cd and be amazed. I haven't been able to turn it off since I got it in the mail two days ago -- 12 full listens and counting."
5,I love it.,"When I got this I was unsure about it, but now that I've tried it I'm hooked. As someone that has always had questionable cooking skills, in the past I didn't cook much. Having lived mostly on prepared meals. Now with this I can cook, and well. I can make perfectly cooked steaks, hamburgers and chicken. Just thaw the meat, put a little seasoning on it and cook. Plus clean up is a snap, takes less time to clean the grill than it does to wash my plates. And it's great for someone like me who lives alone. Perfect for one person. Would totally recommend this to anyone else."
5,Great little grill.,"I have one of these and bought this one for a gift. Great for a quick meal. Grill hamburgers, chicken and sandwiches. They always come out perfect and in just a few minutes. GREAT LITTLE GRILL!George Foreman Foreman Special Edition Super Champ"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this grill about three months ago. I noticed about a month ago that the grill was getting too hot. The top plate turned black in one big spot, and the outside turned a brownish, off-white color. The food would burn, and I had to unplug it during cooking to cool it down. I had to stop using it.I emailed the George Foreman Grill customer service, twice, and no response.I am just glad I didn't pay much. If it had been one of the larger models, I would be out the money. I decided against replacing the defective one with an adjustable temperature (the Panini Grill) due to the poor customer service. After much research, I ordered a different brand of panini grill, Cuisinart, with a stainless steel body, removable and reversible grill surfaces, with a THREE year warranty. It is a much better product than any of the George Foreman grills. The customer service folks have done me a favor by ignoring me."
5,review of susan's cd,"Yet again, on this CD, Susan brings the best of her music, a soulful disco house. Along with I Love To Dance, this is my favorte CD by Susan.This music will keep you going, and going, and going..."
4,Unobvious fun with frustrating parts,"This is more fun than you might think from reading a description of the game. If you are looking for non-violent games, this will fit the bill. If you are looking for no profanity games, it is up to you to avoid cursing when you mess up.There are some frustrating puzzles where it isn't clear how to get to the end even after you study it for awhile. We gave up on a few. And what is it with those gravity wells?"
1,Not worth it,"Not fun, pretty confusing game. I thought it would be a fun family game but too many details to follow."
4,Challenging and fun,If you like puzzle games that require you to think a bit then this one is fun! Also takes some good reflexes and precise control of the wiimote.I bought this along with Kororinpa and I really do like both. My friends think this one take a little too much thinking to be casual though :)
1,Needs lots of improvement,The actions in the controls of this game do not match the responses. We finally figured out that we need to hold the controller sideways. This is a flaw. The game seems very crude and not advanced at all. Frustrating for all ages. There are much better games out there for the same price that are much more advanced.
1,Disappointed again!,Games should be more descriptive on the label.I gave up on this one only 1/2 hour later.Don't like it and don't reccommend it!
5,Mercury Meltdown is so good!,"Just like all the reviewers have already shared -- this is an excellent game -- challenging (but doable with practice), multiple levels, bright colors, different views of the mazes, sound/music is cool (not irritating). This game is for the little kids right on up to the grandparents! GREAT FAMILY FUN or INDIVIDUAL PLAY (get some practice in before playing with the family so you have the advantage!). I am sure this game will continue to be used often through the years.WELL WORTH THE MONEY -- way better than many games that cost 2x or 3x the price!Did I mention the useful tutorial? Also, handheld wii control responds swell -- no problems -- no delays -- hangups, etc.You won't believe what they have done with a blob of mercury! (it's alive!)Do any of you remember the wooden labryinth game with the knobs on two sides -- you maneuvered the little silver ball through the maze and tried to avoid dropping through the holes? Think of that -- HIGH TECH!"
5,Mercury Meltdown,It is a great WII game. Perfect for single player or group. My family takes turn trying to advance the mercury to the next level. Loads of fun!
4,Really Fun Game,My 12 year old son loves this game and is have having a lot of fun trying to beat the clock on the different levels.
4,"pretty fun, worth $20","i've played this game for a couple hours now and it is pretty fun. reminds me of the old ""marble madness"" game, but with an updated feel and technology. it gets pretty difficult, so it isn't a super easy game that you'll blow thru in minutes. it's a good level of challenge."
4,We all loved it.,Was fun for everybody in the family. It takes skill at higher levels but its very good. I would say a good game for skilled hands.
4,A good bargain game,"For the price, the game is good. The controls are responsive, the graphics decent, and the puzzles fun."
2,"Good on Scripture, Weak on Content","This is a brief, hardcover book of short snippets from the author's life, along with related ""lessons"" she says she learned. While she tries to write in a ""rah-rah!"" style, the content/stories don't rise to that level; although the Bible quotes are good. Also, I got a vague sense that she's not telling all the facts concerning the little tales that she states as true. And finally, the only information I can find about this unknown author is that she used to play the part of an obscure character on a tv soap opera twenty-five years ago. Writing is just ok; not great nor inspiring. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book."
2,Pretty Dumb,"This book is pretty much a waste of time. Its mainly little 'letters' relating to how this woman who used to be a minor tv actor 30 years ago used to do everything wrong and now shes became a Christian and supposedly a wise person with all the answers but who cares and who is she? Its nice she got saved but how does that make her an authority? The writing is hohum, the book is short and and kind of dumb and its not fulfiling or have any great revelation or insight. Get something by Ormartian or Meyer if you want depth and meaning. This is kind of a waste. I'm sorry."
4,Excellent Product,The Product was exactly as stated. Highly recommended to anyoneThe Price was extremely expensive
5,Very lovely and a good price,"I used this curtain over a plastic liner for my bathtub and shower. It really is reminiscent of a tiki hut looking out over the ocean, and that's perfect, since my whole bathroom is done as a tiki hut! Good way to get window art at a good price!"
4,heartland trompe l'oeil window art,I love the way the curtains look and they arrived quickly. The only thing I didn't like is that there was an inch difference in panels so at the bottom one curtain was higher than the other. Just poor quality control on the manufacturers part. The seller would have no idea and if I would have complained I'm sure they would have taken them back.
5,Wow!,I bought this to add some cheerful relaxing ambiance to my home and it does just that. Wall tapestries are so expensive but this curtain works well as a tapestry and for the amount of space that it covers is very economical but does not look tacky.
2,Not as pretty as we thought,"They are not as pretty as we thought. They are also quite thin, the light goes through them easily and you can't see the picture well looking against the light. For this price we were not satisfied, so we decided to return them."
3,Very scenic,"The scene depicts a beautiful outdoor image, however, the quality of the curtains was disappointing. The fabric was cheap and flimsy but it does brighten a room."
3,Not what I expected,"Not wide enough to cover my whole glass sliding door, however that is my fault for not measuring. Also it is pretty thin, you can see through it in the day time so you lose the 3D effect of it. It will probably look better next to doorways or windows drawing very little sunlight. Will be shipping this item to my mother."
4,Boba!,Loved this item. Came quickly. Tasts great. worth the money.Normaly costs me 4.75 a cup to buy now i save that money and i get to share. yummm
5,A wonderful source of support!,"Although I have been aware of my daughter's disability for years, I found Ms. Featherstone's book to be a source of support and understanding which I couldn't find elsewhere. This book covers a wide range of disabilities from physical, to mental, to emotional handicaps and gives first-hand accounts from people who have various relationships with the disabled. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a niche in the world as a relative to a someone with a disability."
5,Mais uma vez!,"Acustico 2 starts up where 1 left off...incredible music, brilliant convidados and vocal harmonies that only Boca Livre and MPB-4 could hope to equal. This is another fantastic set from the world's greatest rock band. The extras are nice as well, particularly the interviews with the fans who reveal their love and admiration for this unique group.If you don't own it yet, waste not another second before securing this (and the initial release as well). Viva o Toni Garrido!!Why can't I get the new Boca Livre dvd?"
4,Recomended & Succeeds!,"If you wanted to be lulled to sleep by a person with a good voice and an interesting narrative, choose this tape set. A good value. Is interesting and engaging without overstimulating the listener."
2,Games ok,"The game is ok, my daughter doesnt really care for it, she gets board with it within a few min. Also when we recived it, it looked like it was used (dirty)and i could have sworn i read it was new."
4,Preschoolers will like this a lot!,"I bought this for my 5 yr old daughter for Christmas and she really enjoys playing it. I think that it's fun but at the same time it teaches some hand/eye coordination. My 3 yr old daughter likes to play, but she enjoys one of the mini games that's played separately. I like the fact that there's no cartridges to keep track of and not a lot of pieces. Very simple yet fun for little ones to play!"
3,Game,"I've searched everywhere for a video game that is suitable for my 4 year-old. This game was just fine for about 1 week. After that the replay value dropped from an hour to about 5 minutes, before being bored. She really only likes 2 of the 5 games and I agree. The two of the three she doesn't like are INCREDIBLY easy and the other game, ""Up the Water Spout"" is surprising hard.There are no instructions, so you have to figure out every move through trial & error. Which can be frustrating for a 4 year-old. I also bought this game for the ability to plug in additional ""Game Key"" hardware to add more games. However, the company no longer makes these keys and I haven't been able to find a used one anywhere.It was a good purchase for about 10 days."
3,Great toy for Dora fans ages 2-4!,"The controller is incredibly sturdy, and will stand the test of your child.Including your child's favorite characters from the show, (all the way from Isa to Diego!!) this plug-and-play consists of 4 mini-games played board game style.The games involve a balloon action stage, a digging stage, and a canoe stage all involving beating Swiper Fox, as well as shape puzzles. Frantic fun for your toddler!It is a GREAT game for 2-4 year olds, and with such a short learning curve (courtesy of Dora, naturally), they'll be recognizing hexagons in no time!"
3,The magic of Gershwin,"The wonderful music of Gershwin is the final touch to what I consider the best film by Woody Allen (Story, scenes, the Black and White and so on..). It's a pity the recording has not been re-mastered: It's only an AAD and I think Zubin Mehta deserved some more consideration.Fulvio Arman, Italy"
5,"great soundtrack, well played, fantastic songs. Buy It!","This soundtrack from the WOODY ALLEN film, of the same name, features a 16 minute version of the classic George Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue, and a song called ""Mine"" which sounds a lot like the end theme to Everybody Loves Raymond on CBS. Anyway, well played, by Graffman, and conducted by Mehta. Some of the songs could have been longer, even if it meant this would be a 2 disc set, it's that good. Nice, mellow, music. Buy It!"
5,He Says and She Says,"Track #15 on this cd ""He Says, She Says,"" says it all. Gershwin's gorgeous music carries you along over a musical waterfall with each song on this cd. I wore out 2 cassette tapes before I bought this cd. It is a perfect blend of all that is spectacular about Gershwin. You'll daydream your way to ""Manhattan"" without leaving home. ""Do, Do, Do"" buy this now."
4,"Loud, but heats up a room VERY quickly","This heater pumps out a lot of heat very quickly, and the reddish light it puts out when hot is nice.Perfect for a bathroom or kitchen (though keep it away from water!), but probably wouldn't be good for a bedroom or living room due to the volume."
3,Saxon History,"This book begins with a lovely picnic in the woods, and then dives directly into Saxon history, with a missionary emphasis. I haven't read any further, not being interested in Saxon history, but this would be a good book for someone who was."
2,bad smell,I couldn't live with the smell of the plastic and the shower curtainsfelt too heavy. I decided to return them and go with a machine washable fabriccurtain instead.
2,tweeters,"Well the look of the tweeters was great. It came in tow days, but after i installed the last of 4 speakers i realized that the last onw was blown out it clicks when I turn the raido up. I would like a replacement but i no longer have the contact info. If u can hel me out and make me a happy coustomer please respond asap to jaydash63@yahoo.comThanks"
2,Get this if you are clueless about basic human interaction,"Networking is all about building relationships. If you can't muster up a basic relationship with the people you work with, then go ahead and get this book. Otherwise buy something else."
5,Good stuff,"This book really didn't break any new ground, but then again, it's a ""Dummies"" book. I made an oral presentaiton out of it and it was a smash hit!"
2,Pretty mediocre,"A lot of filler, a lot of common sense. Not a whole lot of techniques, useful advice or even general theory to help you out here. Basically be outgoing and nice to people."
1,I Can't Believe This..Holocaust Revisionism!,"The most shocking aspect of this book is that author,probably to make his subject more coherent,skiped the fact that Bulgarian police arested several thousend jews in Macedonia,and send them promptly to Treblinka.How could Jewish author possibly miss this war episode?This is most horiffic aspect of this book,regardless of the fact that it contains (half)truth about events in Bulgaria during the war.This is Revisionism remiscent of recent statement by David Irving that ""Auschwitz was Disneyland builded by Poland in order to atract tourists.""This book is corect if one think that arest of 7.000 jews by Bulgarians,giving them salty food and packing them into train,is act of heroic rescue!This fact is too well known to be accidentaly neglected,and that is indeed strange aspect of author's presentation of WW II Bulgaria."
1,Biased Book,"Apart from the omission of the deportation of the macedonian jews by the Bulgarians, I would like to point out that at that time (and even now) all Bulgarians would have gladly deported all Turks if they had been the target of Hitler's hate. The jews just simply weren't their scapegoat. And having read the original papers of the correspondence between ""Bulgaria i Tretiat Reich (Bulgaria and the Third Reich)"" that were published in two extensive volumes in Bulgaria 1992 I have to say the author has not done his homework. And having read one reader's reaction thinking that this book justifies Goldhagen's thesis - I have to say it's a dangerous piece of biased writing too. Maybe the Germans are our scapegoats now."
2,"Toys, not tools","I bought this set of pegboard tools to augment my already large collection of pegboard hooks & hangars, etc. I was disappointed in the quality, especially of the plastic bins and bottles. Weak injection molded plastic is not going to stand up to the hazards of my garage. The steel hooks were not much better-- weak and flimsy.Another lesson learned: don't buy hooks that claim to be 1/8"" and 1/4"" compatible to use with your 1/4"" pegboard holes. They are going to wobble and fall out, period."
1,Not Worth It,"Don't pay much for this low quality set. Yeah, I know it's constructed from the thinner diameter wire. I needed a few pcs from it for a project so ordered it knowing what to expect. Again, don't pay much or you'll be dissapointed."
2,"Have a 1/4"" pegboard? Don't bother.","If you are in need of pegboard accessories for a 1/4"" pegboard, don't bother with this product. The product description states it will work for both 1/8"" and 1/4"" pegboards, and while the accessories will fit in the holes of 1/4"" pegboard, they are ridiculously loose (to be expected) and the biggest surprise is that the plastic locks they include to keep the accessories in place don't work at all in pegboards with 1/4"" holes. All in all, the product's price was low enough to make the cost of returning it a moot point but the bins and jars, while flimsy, are usable. If my pegboard was drilled with 1/8"" holes, I'm sure I'd be completely satisfied with this product."
3,Mostly okay,"So, while this set has a good variety the single hooks and containers are very low quality.The single hooks have no second pin to hold the hook on the pegboard when you remove whatever is hanging on it, granted, they provided ""clips"" that are supposed to do just that, problem is they are made of plastic and not something strong like spring steel / metal.The Tray and jar are both made of plastic and the hooks on them are made of the same soft plastic the tray & jar is made of. Don't plan on storing much weight / using them repeatedly as the hooks will break off eventually.All the double hooked pieces work well!"
2,quite disapointed,"The pegs themselves are decent quality, but they DO NOT fit 1/4"" boards. When you put them into a 1/4"" board they don't sit flat against the board and so you can't put those plastic clips on to secure them. They also don't come with the 2nd peg (not sure what you call them) that keeps it stable. As stated by a few others too, the plastic bin and jar pegs are very flimsy, I was very apprehensive even putting them on afraid they would break.On the other hand, the longer tool brackets and multi-tool hangers were pretty decent. The entire set is still far less than just the few parts I liked bought individually, so I gave it 2 stars. But don't buy this expecting to use the L or U shaped hangers."
3,It does make the work area neater.,This is the nicest my husband has ever had his work shop. For that I am grateful.
5,"GREAT MUSIC FROM A WONDERFUL, HAPPY MOVIE","Its a really cute movie, and just an all around ""feel good"" flick. Not to mention the great food prep. in it.The music is wonderful, and I'm listening to it now. The CD came quickly and for a good price.I just want to get up and dance when I listen to it!!!"
5,AWESOME Voices from Germany,"Will not be disappointed if you buy this single. This single is awesome. These two guys have great voices. I just saw the boys at the popstar casting 2 in berlin, Germany. My best friend told me that they have already had a single called Baby Genial. So I listened to the single and I was speechless. I love this song, it doesn't matter if you don't understand German, this song makes me always happy.It's worth it."
3,"Not enough usable, real-time resources for initial start-up funding!","Needs more specifics for initial start-up funding, some actual, proven resources would be great, after all that the purpose.Provide that and this would be an invaluable resource. Right not its not, and the rest of the information is all stuff already available for free."
4,Nice!,Very informative! I took off one star because the CD was broken when i got it. Im trying to start a non profit charity for madagascar so this really helped!
4,AAA Customer Service,"My book arrived with a very minor crack in the included CD. It could have easily happened in transit. I e-mailed the supplier and they immediately sent me a replacement CD... The book is straighforward and as expected with any from the ""Dummies"" series, but I will go back to the vendor again and again based on their fantastic response!!!"
1,Not helpful at all,"As an attorney, I read a lot of publications about creating nonprofits -- here's what you need to know about this book:1) No clear instructions on how to incorporate or how to fill out (very complicated) IRS forms necessary to obtain tax exempt status.2) Covers a lot of topics only lightly, skipping important details.3) No detailed info on state laws, which is extremely important to every nonprofit corporation.If you really don't want to visit an attorney, Nolo's book ""How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation"" is the best one available, and addresses everything this Dummies book doesn't."
3,Decent introductory guide,"While I wish the book covered more specifics, it does offer a helpful broad-based introduction to the main aspects of fundraising. I would recommend this book especially to small community-based nonprofit volunteers and board members who want to gain ""the big picture"" and research the particulars (e.g., state-wide tax laws) elsewhere."
3,good music... terrible singing,"What the hell happened to Page Hamilton's voice? He used to have a great cathartic clean voice and a growly scream, and now it's like he's regressed into a bad 80's metal shrill. The music's good, but I can't buy this album cause he sounds like a tweener."
4,File under honest Rock n Roll... and I love it!,"Page Hamilton is a guitar master who has changed the landscape of music. Countless bands owe him, Henry Bogdan, Peter Mengede and John Stanier for their muse and thriving careers.Ok, now I'll tell you something you may not know:Forget Meantime, forget anything Helmet has ever done before. Enjoy Monochrome on it's own terms. It's different. It's stripped-down. It's honest. It'll rock you silly. The songs are hauntingly good - just give it a chance. I've been singing myself hoarse to songs like ""Almost out of sight"", ""Monochrome"" and ""Bury Me"". Page is back!This album will endure the test of time. Monochrome will and should be regarded as a great rock and roll album from a great rock and roll master."
5,"Similar to Meantime, But Still Great","I've been a fan of Helmet since 1991. As pointed out by Mike (Death to the Metal Purists), the band reenlisted Wharton Tiers, collaborator on Strap It On and Meantime, Helmet's best albums. That accounts for the similarity of sound between those earlier albums and this one. I was startled by the first eight or so bars of 'Brand New' on Monochrome, because it is uncannily similar to the start of 'Turned Out' on Meantime, down to the time signature of the opening riff.That being said, this album rocks in its own right. I really like the opening track, 'Swallowing Everything', and the guitar solos are vintage Page Hamilton, violent and beautiful.If you have ever been into Helmet, I would recommend this album. I would also recommend it if you like heavy music, and your tastes also include Explosions in the Sky, Pelican, System of a Down, or Tool."
3,"Good Music, Bad Vocals","I agree with most others that the music is pretty damn good, but Page's vocals are just way off course. Some people might like this, but having been a fan since 1992's ""Meantime"", I'm not one of those people."
2,Napalm Death?,"Man, was I excited when I saw this CD in a store in Newfoundland. Unfortunately, I have to agree with Messr. Ashton, the vocals on this album are terrible. Page Hamilton sounds like the hair farmer from Napalm Death (a compliment that ain't). Don't know why he's shreiking his vocals. The two songs Page takes a more restrained approach are much more listenable. As well, the production seems to be lacking somewhat too; doesn't sound very bass heavy. I'd love to see these guys succeed, but sadly, I think their best years are behind them. How about an album of Sabbath covers instead????"
1,"Shameless Ploy to reuse the name ""Helmet""","This album is by farrrrr Helmet's worst CD....if that what you want to call the band. With the only surviving member Paige helming the band, this CD sounds nothing like the 1st 4 CDs of the band....nothing. This CD sounds like a shameless ploy to produce lame tracks with Paige's crackling faded voice slapped with the famous band name on it. Ughh...i bought this CD the day it came out hoping to be better than the last ""new"" Helmet album, and this one was far worse. I couldn't find a single song to jam out with so i turned around and sold it on eBay for $8.00. ****WARNING!!!! If you are a Helmet fan and LOVE their music from the 90's era (Betty, Aftertaste, etc) than DO NOT buy or even listen to this CD**** ....you have been warned, mooahahaahahhaha"
1,Nice idea but very flimsy,This seat protector is a nice idea but the quality and endurance are disappointing. After using it for about a month the corners started folding down and the velcro bottoms never reached below the leather on the car's seat. My 15 month old daughter can kick them until they end up in her lap. In order to get the velcro to reach the seat bottom we had to tie the tops with the least amount of tie. This makes the tops floppy and the velcro never stuck for long anyway. The blue trim comes apart from the plastic and makes the whole thing look very shabby. I threw them away after about two months of use. They may be cheap but they aren't worth it.
1,bad investment,I purchased these seat back protectors for my suburban that has leather seats. I have a 3 year old and a 10 month old and the 3 year old is constantly putting her feet on the seat. The ties on the protector don;t line up with the head rest which makes it bunch up at the top and I didn't put the velcro adhesives on the bottom of my leather seats because they are too expensive. The protector just hangs on the back on m seat. I have recently thrown the protectors away. I would suggest investing in a good cleaning agent instead of buying this protector.
1,don't waste your time... or money,i agree with some of these reviews about the velcro down the bottom. it will not stick and stay on my VW Jetta cloth seats. tried everything but just eneded up throwing them away. GO TO ONESTEPAHEAD.COM. they have the new ones that tie around your car seat. MUCH BETTER!
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNKJUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNKJUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNKJUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNKJUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNKJUNK,"I just received these a few days ago and already have thrown them away. What a waste of $$$$! The sticky on the velcro will not stick to cloth seats, leaving the bottom just hanging there! It is cold here and the first time these got cold, they shrivel up and pop out in the middle so your child's feet will now be on the seat one on each side of this plastic thing. Junk junk... I ordered the ones another reviewer recommended. Hopefully, they will be better!"
2,Just hanging,"I bought these seat protectors for my leather seats hoping that they'd help protect them from my 3yr old who's constantly kicking the seat. My biggest peeve with them is that you have to stick the velcro onto the back of your seat. I didn't just pay all this money for leather only to stick stickers all over the seats, not knowing if the glue will ever come off.(ie like a price tag) I guess that may have been my own fault. Had I researched a little more, I'd have seen that. Anyhow, mine just kinda 'hang' there. The good news is, my seat is protected from her shoes."
2,Pretty flimsy,It was a great idea but they are pretty flimsy and I wanted another alternative to sticking it to my seats. Doesn't work well in an SUV wher the seats are higher off the ground. The top corners started folding down after a few months.
2,Not worth the money,I originally bought these for my VW Passat with cloth seats. They worked ok in it but I now own a Volvo V70 R with leather seats. They velcro does not stay affixed to the seat so they are useless. I'm going to either have to live with the footprints from my children or find a way to rig it up by tying it to something under the seat.
4,protects,i purchased these for my suburban. i have a 2 and a 3 year old. other than the fact that the ties for the headrest were a little off from mine (no big deal) these are great and do just what they are supposed to. i have cloth seats and the velcro that is on the plastic did cling right to the seat back fabric. these have definately saved the back of my seats. i have now purchased them for both of our vehicles.
3,not the best,"i got these for my toddler and i'm not that impressed with them. i wish i had read the reviews first, but it was an impulse buy at the store. i have cloth seats and the velcro stuck for a few weeks and is now worthless. it is not a huge problem though, because my son knows that he is not allowed to put his feet under the plastic. but he is still 2 and doesn't always obey. i'm thinking of attaching my own string on the bottom to go around the seat. we'll see how that works out. there are better ones out there that i've seen since my purchase."
4,Please with product and delivery,The seat back protectors are just what I wanted and I was very happy with the quick delivery. Thanks
2,"Some good, but some bad too","The good is that this book does not overwhelm you with flashy pictures like a lot of Physics books do. However, the book loses 2 stars for too many typos. It seemed like every week I would get an email from my professor with corrections to the problems. I'm docking it another star for some sections which I think could have been explained better. The chapter on semiconducters was not very englightening. I had to read another book before I felt comfortable with the material.If they ever make another edition of this book, I'm sure it will be great, but this one is just a little too rough around the edges."
5,solid book,"Since modern physics is hardly modern anymore, most of the important topics were developed 100 years ago, so it doesn't matter that the book is 11 years old. the best part is the lack of bright colors, useless notes on the side of the page, confusing layouts- all of which add unnecessary cost to already expensive textbooks. Furthermore, if you compare to other books, the problems are generally better, with similar treatment of main concepts.The book does suffer from the common problem of the first two chapters being mostly an historical review of concepts from 100 level physics."
4,A Must Have Resource for the Do It Yourself Investor,This book contains 1000's of important websites for the do it yourself investor. The author has a small paragraph describing each site. This book will save you hours of search engine work.
1,Complete waste of money,"This book must be a joke. It really takes 'pocket book' to a new level - miniature would define it better. It has very scarce information about the characters (wonder why...), and its size makes it somewhat difficult to handle.Not recommended at all!"
1,this is not a good book!!!!,"I hated it, it was a waste of money and I think that id you want to know about a charactor buy the Esential Guide of star wars charactors because this was a waste of money and time TRUST ME!!"
4,KEEPIN IT HOT,"Is KEEP THE FIRE Loggins' best album? I don't think so but it's an effective sample of Loggins proficiency as an entertaining pop musician/performer/composer.The nine tracks range from upbeat dance songs to tender heartfelt (somewhat schmaltzy) ballads. THIS IS IT and KEEP THE FIRE are the two biggest hits and are still listenable today. JUNKANOO HOLIDAY and MR. NIGHT are notably infectious and NOW AND THEN is a beautiful ballad. The remaining tunes are passable though not truly remarkable.Released in 1979, its really the last in a series of radio-friendly discs that exemplified Loggins commercially focused works. Soon he would beome a little more bolder and eclectic in upcoming releases. KEEP THE FIRE is a probable inclusion in any Loggins fan library."
4,"What's Great Shines, What's not Festers","Let's see, those who've seen my review of ""Celebrate Me Home"" know my stand on KL's Music...Huge fan but not of every aspect of the man's career. Here is a prime example of how the sound can vary. This is It...Masterpiece with amazing potential, grace and style. R&B/Pop at its best. Junkanoo Holiday...Cheesy pop tart of music. Who's Right, Who's Wrong...It has Michael Jackson on it, need I say more? Whats good you can for sure tell, what sucks you know for sure. You decide...I like this record when you get to hear whats great, and skip what's crap...See for yourself"
4,Works Great,This waist trimmer is a good addition to my exercise program. The velcro closure fits secure. I just wish it had the magnets like my other one that is very old but still usable. This one is light weight and as stated has a secure fit. I am happy with it.
4,Iron Man Wais Trimmer,"Although none of these products will melt away stomach fat without diet and exercise this product is slightly thicker then most and adds extra support for your back, which is the main reason why I use it. It supports your back as well as making the whole region sweat and stay warm, whicks keeps your back loose during workouts."
1,Good idea but...,"Comfortable and makes you sweat good, but when taking it off after wearing it the first time the velcro tore the top layer off. If they had stiched a seam all the way around the waist trimmer, it would have been perfect. I don't suggest this particular one. I returned it and purchased the Danskin brand. Same product but w/ the seam all the way round it and I love it."
5,Waist Trimmer,"The item was received promptly and was as expected, it was not any better or worse quality than was discribed in the specifications."
2,"The basics, repackaged","This book has a catchy title and an eye-catching design, but the content of the book fails to live up to its promise. If you've read any basic sales books at all, you can skip this one. If you haven't, it may hold some value... but there are better ones out there."
4,CUTE Shoes a little narrow,Love these shoes they are cute and I get lots of complements. They have lasted well over time. They are a little narrow in the front because of the pointy shoe thing but I only feel it after a long wear.
4,Songs for Li'l Praisers - Good for young children,"I found this music to be very entertaining for children, especially those 2-9 years of age. I do music with children at church and have found these songs to be easily learned and fun for the kids to sing. There is also a video available which will show motions to most of the songs. This tape has been available for several years, but I find that my children enjoy it as much today as my older nieces and nephew did when they were younger. Songs are scripturally based. They are fast paced, but are not ""dance"" mixes. If you purchase this tape, I believe you will enjoy it as much as your kids."
5,"Fits my black hawk, comfortable to wear.","This is a great holster. Comfortable to wear. My only issue was that it did not come with the ammo slot holder as seen in the picture. Iam a large man, so no problem adjusting to my enormous girth. Very nice quality, firm leather."
3,A great collection in 1979,"This album was released in late 1979 a few months after Discovery although nothing from that album appears here. At the time of it's release in the days of vinyl and tape, it was a pretty good hits collection. However, over the years and in the days of cds, there have been no shortage of ELO hits packages which not only include the songs featured here but more. If you're looking to own this one for nostalgic reasons like you used to have this one way back when, cool but if you're looking for a fuller overview try Flashback, Afterglow, All Over The World with Ticket To The Moon or even Strange Magic. In fact, All Over The World really does feel like an updated and expanded version of this album. If you end up buying All Over The World, I'd recommend getting Ticket To The Moon with it."
5,70's memories,"Back in the days before the term,80's metal ever entered my vocabulary,there was my 70's childhood and ELO was a part of it.I've always considered ELO to be a Beatles soundalike band and this album contains a lot of their best known FM contemporary radio hits.Their unique rock/pop/classical fusion sound was hugely successful.You can't go wrong with Telephone Line,Evil Woman,Strange Magic,Livin Thing and the sweep you off your feet track,Turn to Stone.Some people might consider this to be bubblegum,but these songs are very catchy and fun to listen to and after all,it was the 70's and songwriter/band member Jeff Lynne was at the top of his game.The only notable exclusion from this collection was Don't Bring Me Down but if you're just a casual fan,this will work very well.This is a good album to pull out every now and then when you want to hear and remember music from a bygone era with irresistable melodies and feel good lyrics and is very enjoyable and will definitely perk up your ears."
4,Needs more songs,"At first when I saw this CD I was shocked to see that Don't Bring Me Down wasn't on this album but I later figured out why and I wonder how come this CD is missing some songs like It's Over, Do Ya, Fire on High, Boy Blue, Daybreaker, Roll Over Beethoven and Poker but overall this is a good ELO compilation album and it's way better than ELO Classics, if you're a new fan of ELO I would start off with Strange Magic: The Very Best of ELO, I wish that they didn't edit out the intro to Strange Magic."
3,"Good but Better, Comprehensive Collections are out there!","This album has great early tracks but as a previous reviewer stated, there are more comprehensive discs out there with better sound as well. This disc is not remastered and so does not sound as great as it really should given today's sound technology. However, if you are getting this as a summary of their earlier stuff and then going on to get ""Discovery"" and ""Time"" remastered, you'd have gotten pretty much the best that ELO have ever done. Value for the money you pay but I'd recommend going straight for ""Strange Magic...."""
3,Can't get them out of my head.,"To me, ELO is another one of those bands I thought I knew little about, until I got this collection, at which time I realized I knew half these songs well. A nice mesh of classic rock, pop, and a hint of disco, many of these tracks are standard radio play. The more well known would be ""Evil Woman"", ""Livin' Thing"", ""Strange Magic"", and ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"". The rest however hold up, and some are easily as good as these hits are. There's only one song I really miss, maybe because of my age, and that's ""Don't Bring Me Down"". It's possibly my favorite ELO song, and because of that I might search for a different collection myself. ""Hold On Tight"" is missing too. I'd even like to have ""Xanadu"" on here, even if it did sound a tad out of place. Overall though these are the better songs from their best years."
4,A Classic Rock Collectors Must,"ELO's unique blend of rock instruments with the synthesized orchestral accompanyment leaves you looking for many more people on stage. The songs have distinct and audible lyrics, and some of the more upbeat tunes have a driving rock backbone. Many tracks on this CD bring goosebumps from memories of their live performances and all the good times we had singing along with each song in their debut years. A thoroughly enjoyable album With ""their own"" sound, jammin' keyboards, guitar licks, and a listenable soft side for classic (hard) rock fans. You'll reminisce with every track!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MUSIC?,"I ORDERED THIS CD CAUSE WHEN PREVIEWED I LIKE WHAT I HEARD. HOWEVER, WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE SONGS I REALIZED THAT ON MOST OF THEM THE SONGS WERE CUT SHORT,IT WASN'T LIKE IT SOUNDED WHEN I PREVIEWED IT NOR DID IT SOUND LIKE IT WHEN PLAYED ON THE RADIO.I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE & WISHED I HAD RETURNED IT.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF THE SONGS?"
2,stick with the name brand on this one,Not a fan of this flash. While it works as intended it is very limited in what it can do. I'd stick with a Nikon and be able to expand later down the road. If you are doing any wireless work you should always stick with Nikon if you can.
5,Very Convenient!,This product worked great and it worked with all three popular systems which allowed me to switch from one to another without having to purchase different cables. I would reccomend this product
5,The Best Of the New Bolivian and LAtin american music,"Two marvelous musicians, joined together as players and composers of a very well selectioned themes. The sound quality, plus the feeling both artist put on the interpretation make this CD a valuable piece of art."
3,Good textbook,"Great textbook for those looking to learn about how communication is and can be used in the business world. Though, it may be a little outdated. Compare with other newer versions to get complete picture."
1,This is the study guide,"Beware!! Even though it says ""Excellence in Business Communication"" as the product title it is actually ""Excellence in Business Communication Study Guide"". I will upload a photo to show that. I did however get a full refund from betterworldbooks within 48 hours."
3,tarot music,Well created music for tarot reader. Graphic on the album cover remarkable to look at. Very enjoyable music to listen to.
5,Beautiful and soothing....,"This music really has me swooning (in ecstasy). This is not the typical synthesizer stuff. This is a great compilation of music, played live by musicians who gathered in India to perform this at the Osho Meditation Resort in Pune. There are many pieces here to be enjoyed....but I think my favorite is ""Wings of Love."" Excuse me while my heart goes flying around the universe again!"
5,nice,"I bought several of these earrings as a gift, and they really are cute. They are a good size not too big or too small."
3,Cute earrings,"Although these are really cute earrings, I didn't realize that the emblem was plastic. However, for the price, I can't complain. I still wear them to games!"
5,what you see is what you get,"They are a bit small. Maybe a half inch-3/4 tall logo but I expected it. I got them for my lady, who is sensitive to metals used in jewelry, and they don't irritate her skin. She loves them."
3,good product,"Good product, I love my earrings. My only complaint is that they shipped them in a plain old regular letter envelope with no padding. Luckily, the earrings arrived in one piece with no damage!"
4,not bad for the price!,"I saw these ones and immediately thought of a friend who's crazy about the Dallas Cowboys and also has quite an earring addiction... I thought they would be quite big cheap plastic-like earrings but I ordered them anyway... I was pleasently surprises (and so was she) because they are nice, metal earrings with enamel colors, not the cheap plastic thing I was expecting... on the downside they are a little small (a little smaller and they would be little girl's earring).. but overall really nice, you can't get that quality from wally-world or other stores lol..."
5,Perfect!!,"The earrings came on time and look exactly like the picture. My daughter loves them. Not a cheap material, just right!"
1,Awful,It's been over a month and I have not received my item. I only put one star because it wouldn't let me put zero.
5,Very Solid Freshman CD,"I certainly hope to hear more from this kid. On this CD, Stephens displays a very cool bluegrass banjo style with a ""down home"" feel. Not as flashy as Scruggs but not as raw as Fairchild either. Somewhere in between. A very tasteful very cool very bluegrass style that respects bluegrass traditions yet sounds fresh. There are no lyrics on this CD. Recording quality is excellent and his fellow musicians are superb. Stephens mixes in some clawhammer and even some of his own guitar pickin but this is still primarily a bluegrass banjo cd that will not disappoint the bluegrass banjo lover."
4,Meet The Future!,"Jeremy Stephens is only 16 years old - and so talented. One listen to this album will convince you that he will be around for a long time. He makes the banjo sound so effortless to play, and it is not. He does a fine job on originals and covers of Don Reno, Flatt & Scruggs and the Dr. Ralph Stanley.With a fine support cast (the most recognizable name being Ronnie Stewart) this is a CD of strong instrumentals and strongly recommended to anyone who likes or plays banjo and recommended slightly less to bluegrass fans (those who like lyrics)."
4,"Maid Marian's Story, Changed","I read this book as a child of 9 years old and loved it so much, I checked it out multiple times! It was also the first book I checked out at the new library after we moved. The simple tale of Maid Marian, Robin's companion & friend, had always intrigued me and I always wanted to know more so I could imagine their whole story. This book was a good something to scratch that literary itch. However, it is a completely un-historically accurate retelling (and a complete re-telling is is).The names are different, as well as the back stories, time period even and events that take place. Very different from the traditional story but highly enjoyable to read all the same. A quick, beautifully-spun read."
5,"Factors of a great read: action, romance, intensity","I happen to love fantasy books , though I only truely enjoy the ones that allow the characters to seep into you and you become them. For me this was one of those books that take you away and into the story Marian was a wonderful character that you never hear anything personal about but this told it from her . With this book, I have learned to see Marian more as Robin Hood's mate, not annoying female pest. Love the romance, intensity, and action."
5,Absolutely beautiful,"This is a believable reimaging of the tales of Robin Hood told from the POV of Marian and the women in Medieval England. It is rich in detail and historical fact. I highly recommend this book to anyone...As to the previous reviewer's comments about anti-Catholic sentiments. Have you never studied history? The Catholic Church in the Dark Ages were full of bishops and clergy similar to those portrayed in the book. The Church was bigoted, violent and prepared to go to any lengths to ensure that women were kept underfoot. Before slamming this book for revealing history, perhaps you should take a look at the real history, you will find it is much...much worse and it was all done in God's name"
1,Sorry...,I agree with the review about innappropriateness. I'm a huge fan of Robin Hood legend (and a girl myself) and I think that Maid Marian (she's supposed to really represent purity and chasteness and feminity) is really skewed in this book too.
5,Creative retelling of an old story,"I thought this book was a good read. It tells the story of Robin Hood from a different point of view: Marian's. Though I don't think you would ""get"" this book if you don't know medievil speak. I think it keeps you guessing about some parts of the book. Like who really was Marian's real mother? That answer will be found later. Though it makes me sad that some of the main characters die. I think that this was a well thought out book. A real page turner I thought. With some very interesting main and secondary characters. I can tell that the author likes women's legins and history."
5,100 Greatest U.S. Coins,"Just an incredible book. Beautiful color pictures and very interesting information on each coin. A complete history on each coin, market value and a very detailed description of each coin. This book isn't just for coin collectors. This book is for anyone who has an interest in the history of U.S. coins. A truly excellent addition to anyone's library."
4,I think it was good,it shows a different side of stevie. this book barely has anything to do with horses though. my fav character is carole and this book was totally just about stevie. allot of the books are only about stevie. its a good book though
3,Hidden morals,"This was a good book. It kind of showed Stevie's comptive side. I though it was neat that there was a Tenn. Walking Horse, but what was with the pink breeches? I have been riding scence I was four and I have never seen Pink breeches! i've seen purple, green and some other werid colors but never pink. But anyway you should read this book, it's got some hidden morals in it.PS Bring Back the old covers! These girls look like they have no confedence around horses, or look like they know what there doing. They Don't even look old enough! Plus....would you were that to a barn? What happened to tall boots and breeches?"
3,Those girls on the cover are WAY too young!,"Okay- I really love the Saddle Club books, but what is up with the girls they're using on the cover?! Carole, Lisa, and Stevie are like 14 or 15 years old now, but the girls pictured on the new covers look like they're about 9 or 10. I thought the Saddle Club girls were supposed to be getting older and more mature, but it seems like just the opposite is happening. Please, the stories are great, but go back to the paintings!"
2,Ugh,"I think that Bonnie's writing in this book was horrible. The girls are turning childish and stupid. Not to mention, the books are getting unrealistic--pink breeches? Yeah right! And I hate the real people on the cover. They're way too young. Anyways, this was the book that made me decide to stop reading the saddle club series. I used to LOVE them, and it felt kinda like I was growing up with Carole, Lisa, and Stevie, but now the girls just act younger and younger. To make a long story short, I don't recommend this book."
4,IMPRESSIVE,"When I first heard this record, it caught me off guard, but in a good way. Venice 13 brings something new to the table with their energy-filled style. Their sound is a mixture of break-beat, hardcore elements, dance, and hip hop. ""Razorhead"", ""Juice"", and ""Maker Taker"" were off the hook tracks. I'm really impressed with this CD and think it's gonna do extremelly well."
3,Easy Gardner 6030 birdblock 28 ft X 28 ft,We made a frame to go over and around our blueberry bushes. Glad to see that we could order netting that was 28 ft by 28 ft. It would be perfect to keep the birds away from our blueberries. Not so much.......the netting came in 2 pieces - for almost $40 we really thought we were getting a piece of netting. We already had scraps that we could have used but we thought this would work better.Wasted $40
2,Bird Netting,This netting is very hard to work with. It does control birds from getting at the berries effectively.. I would help if it was a little more substantial; so that it wouldn't tangle so easily and catch on everything it touches. I would not purchase this product again!
1,A waste of money,"This phone is horrible. I bought it for my son for x-mas and have been meaning to review it, to save someone else the disappointment. The animation itself is funny, but after the phone rings it gets stuck and you can hear the motor running. We had to physically tilt Homer's head down each time to shut it off. The other complaint is that if my son picked up his phone and then I answered another one, when he hung up it made this horrible screeching noise. I ended up just unplugging it. I wish I would have kept the box and sent it back."
4,"If It Were Longer, It Would Be Better","I enjoyed this book, and would probably have loved it, if it hadn't been so underdeveloped. The outline or the bones of this book are great, but the story really needs to be fleshed out. I also think this would have been a bit more interesting if the heroine were older than 18. In short, this would have been absolutely wonderful if it had been a full-length book. Maybe this is one of those instances when an author ought to consider an update or rewrite, because this has the potential of being a best seller. (But, please, please don't do it, Miss Ballogh, unless you love the story and characters enough to do a better job than Catherine Coulter in her attempts at rewrites). With these provisos, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. If not entirely satisfying, it was nonetheless a quick and enjoyable read."
2,An adulterous husband is never a good thing,"I have to admit, I never really got beyond the husband's adultery. I like Mary Balogh's novels, but for myself this isn't one of her best. The heroine is rather wishy-washy, and it's always difficult for the hero to overcome being unfaithful to the heroine. I preferred Balogh's ""Lord Carew's Bride,"" ""Dark Angel,"" ""The Famous Heroine,"" ""Dancing With Clara,"" etc. to this one."
1,truly disappointing,"As a fan of Ina Garten, both the Barefoot Contessa cookbooks and her TV show, this recipe organizer priced at $20 is a sham.First, to have an item for sale and show no photographs and no proper description should not be allowed. Thank goodness for my local Barnes & Noble for obtaining a copy for me to preview before purchasing it. It saved me the cost of shipping it back to Amazon.This organizer is nothing more than a cardboard accordian-style file folder. It comes with a few (not more than 10, I believe) glossy, full paged recipes from Barefoot Contessa cookbooks.For me, I was looking for a place to store and organize all of the various recipes I have collected throughout the years... the ones I have ripped from magazines and newspapers and the ones jotted down by friends. This organizer doesn't seem any better than the kitchen drawer they are currently stored in.I expected more of a product that bares the Barefoot Contessa name."
2,Fitment issues,"i have a 1989 F250 4x4 5.8 IFS. the headers were both a little wide for the truck, like the head flange was welded on wrong. hooker has great support, and a 90 day return policy (unlike Amazon). the first pair needed to have the passenger frame ground 1/4"" or so. the drivers side got smashed by the driveshaft yoke. i returned these and got another set, and they fit worse. i heated them up (installed) with the engine and a torch, and used a come-along to get the clearance i needed."
1,"It disintegrated, but company rufunded my money.","After on a few months I began to notice that the fabric was flaking, leaving a dusting of material on my patio set. Then it began to totally disintegrate covering my furniture like a snow of fabric dust. Update: Easy gardener said that it was from a batch of defective material and refunded my money for the material in January of 2011."
1,"Fabric disintegrates and leaves ""snow"" on patio","I love the color, the look and the shade provided by this product. Unfortunately, the fabric started disintegrating in less than a year and now it consistently leaves ""snow"" on my patio and on anyone who's attempting to enjoy a relaxing few minutes on my patio. Installing it was no easy task. Now, it has to be completely redone with a different fabric. I offer this review so that you might avoid a similar frustration.Easy Gardener 72012 Sun Screen Fabric - Saddle Tan - 6-Foot x 12-Foot - 75% Sun Block"
2,Does not last long,"I purchased this item in tan two years ago to cover my succulents. Noticed this summer that it was flaking and crumbling. Read an earlier reviewer who stated they had the same problem. I have used shade cloth from Lowe's and HD for many years and still have some of it. Either I purchased better quality in the past----never noticed the brand before, or the formula for manufacture has changed. I am going to try the ""Coolaroo"" product and see how that works."
4,Nice shade. Not easy to put up.,"Our four hens spend all afternoon under the shade cloth. It a little ""cooler"" there, but doesn't bring the temperatures down all that much in the Arizona heat. We attached the cloth to a frame using grommets and washers screwed into the frame. It's a task that requires a ladder, a power screw driver, and time. But once it's attached, it stays put."
2,not what I expected,I thought the color(which is what I wanted)would be the same as the picture on Amazon but it is a brighter green and doesn't match my other screen fabric(different brand). When the description has heavy green I thought the fabric would be heavier and less see-through than the one I have. Found it to be lighter and more see- through so put one on top of another for more privacy.
5,And what would YOU do if you inherited a million dollars?,"This book is an interesting existential analysis of the human condition as seen through the eyes of a former office clerk who, after inheriting a large sum, decides to leave his job. From then on, he alternately exists experientially and through hallucination. He views the rush of the individual through the world in moments both intimate and clear followed by gigantic, historical events that pass in a blur. I found it to be a complex work of great style and vision. That sounds like a real cop-out but he really does make a fine set of statements in a vivid, yet surreal way. A good read but you gots to pay attention."
1,Disappointed,I order from Amazon all the time and this is the first time I have ever had a problem with my order. I purchased one jar of the Walkerwood Solomon Gundy and when it arrived and I open the package and noticed right away that the seal was broken. It was leaking all over the place. I was so grossed out I threw it in the trash. Very disappointed.
5,Spiritual Therapy,"I highly recommend this book as excellent reading for any therapist who comes from a spiritual perspective, especially those who are student of A Course in Miracles or any of many other spiritual paths. It reinterprets some of Freud's ideas of transference, countertransference and projection in spiritual terms.If you have ever wondered how to solve your own issues that come up when you work with others, this book can be a great help. It is best when used in conjunction with the whole Course in Miracles."
5,Love it,"This small, simple toy is surprisingly fun to play with. Not only is it really pretty to look it and superb quality, but it's educational and fun."
4,"Solid construction, suvives little twin boys","We got this toy for the boys, both about 17 months, and it has survived their best attempts at destruction. The wood is good and thick, and the paint is more of a very bright stain than paint, so no chipping. All in all, it's a durable toy that the kids will love to whack."
1,this is a stupid design,"This is a retarded design. I don't know how come other people's children didn't take it apart immediately, but I saved it from my first child, who just took it apart instead of banging the mallet onto the REMOVEABLE lever that flips the ball up and gave it to my second child born 3 years later. He did exactly the same thing! Both children were far more interested in removing the piece that makes it work than actually using the toy as designed. There's not much entertainment value in removing the lever. It's pretty much a dead end street for fun. I think Plan Toys stopped making this toy, and that is good, because Aunt Tamar wasted 30-40 dollars on this dumb thing."
4,Understanding Personal Identity,"Not only does the author weave philosophy, traditional social science, and contemporary narrative theory and methods together, she does it with a grace and anticipation of the reader's next question that are not found in other books on the subject. There is depth, complex analysis, and a light touch that encouraged me to read right on to the last page."
2,Not One of Their Best,"I usually love to show Eyewitness DVDs for my science classes. The kids enjoy them and they usually remain engaged. This video, however, did not keep my students interested for longer then 10 min. The graphics are very outdated and some of the information seemed pointless (comparision of dinos to building machinery). I realize they cannot have live shots, but the claymation was obviously far older then the dvd production. A few CGI scenes would have helped immensely."
2,Don't Bother With This,"Let me just say, this video is only 30 minutes long. In comparison, Walking with Dinosaurs is 180 minutes long. Don't bother with this. It's just a waste of money. The animation is OK, but nowhere near as good as Walking with Dinosaurs. THe narration - useless. Now, by no means I like the Walking with Dinosaurs narration, yet I can't stand this one's narration. Okay, if you are REALLY REALLY desperate, you might want to check this out, yet I wouldn't waste your money if I was you - just get Walking with Dinosaurs."
5,Blood Curling Story,This book is about a girl named Laura who goes to sleep away camp. She hears a girl singing in the woods every night. When no one is around the girl who sings in the woods tries to run Laura over with a boat. Will she escape from the girl in the woods? Read this story to find out.
4,This book was good. Not Great. Good.,A good book with a twisting end. I like the camp books. It was very interesting. R.L. Stine should make a Curse of Camp Cold Lake II. It would fit in better.
3,An okay book.,"Mr. Stine's popularity increases every year,but he fails to succeed in books #50-56. Maybe it is that his characters lack superiority. His books are suspenseful but give way to comedy. It is also that they are too melodramatic. I think that it is only that he is not having good ideas. The Curse of Camp Cold Lake is an alright book. Of his many books, this one is about average. And it is successful. Ben H. Rensselaer,N"
5,youth fiction,"These books are helping my grandson learn the enjoyment of reading. He was having a hard time, but these books hold his attention and he really looks forward to getting a new one in the series."
5,Goosebumps: The Curse Of Camp Cold Lake,This book is about a girl named Sarah that goes to a camp with her brother Aaron. Sarah really hates the camp and doesn't really get along with her bunkmates. One time Sarah tries to worry everyone with pretending to drown. But the way she had planned it didnt work. Suddenly a ghost came and wants to be Sarah's buddy. Sarah tries to get rid of her but can't. So everyone thinks she is crazy. Later Sarah tries to escape and finds Della the ghost in the forest. And suddenly Sarah's bunkmate shows up and rescues her. One thing happend though the bunkmate was actually a ghost! And that's how the story ends.
1,Don't Waste your money!,"First its funny, Its not mention if it is for boys or girls. its not comfortable. Finally its was not what I expected."
3,Sir John's love is more impressive the first time around,"While I generally agree with the review of Ahmed Ismael, I must give the nod to the earlier EMI recording, which has greater depth and spread to the sound. Chandos engineers have practically placed the voices in our laps with a resultant loss of orchestral detail. The work is, of course, lovely but if the ear is fatigued by the sound the myriad beauties cannot make their full effect. If one adds to this the fact that the EMI is a midprice reissue the choice becomes even more clear. Bravo to Hickox and company but no standing ovation this time."
4,700c x 37,"These are the tires that can on my (May 29) 2012 Surly Long Haul trucker touring bike. I didn't know anything about these tires and asked my bike dealer if they were any good or just cheap tires that came with the bike. He said they were pretty good tires and there was no need to replace them for the loaded touring I do (country roads).Well I have 1,276 miles on them now and not a single flat (knock wood). I should put another 1000+ miles on this year, but so far they have been great - no complaints. Only 4 stars for now, because I want to see how they are at the end of next year. I'll probably buy another set if they hold up well."
2,Not as pictured -no reflective stripe!,The tire pictured has a reflective sidewall stripe. The tire I received does not.
2,Let's Not Distort The Issue,"Unfortunately, this book, and the review of it offered by Ashutosh Chatterji, is more about defending Calcutta from the western view of it than it is about the ""cultural and literary history"" that is the title of the book. I bought this book in Calcutta so that I might have a more in-depth history of the place I was visiting. Instead, I got a book full of opinions and one-sided propaganda. This is definitely an Indian's nationalistic view of the city of Calcutta and not an objective history lesson, as the book's title advertises. Whereas Krishna Dutta is indeed a gifter writer, she, or her publishing company, should have come up with a less-misleading title. Next time, pick up the ""History of the Republican Party"" by Rush Limbaugh or ""The Cultural History of Russia"" by Josef Stalin - just kidding of course."
2,A waste of time!!!,"This movie is about a woman who goes to Madrid to write about ""machismo"", and believing in the old stereotype that all Spaniards are machistas she embarks in a futile search for the ultimate macho. It was a horrible movie with horrible dialogue and force acting. The main female character lack desirability, and in the scenes that were suppose to look or be sexy, she failed miserably. The translator, a macho Spaniard and an Antonio Banderas aficionado, only looked well with his mouth tightly seal. I don't recommend this atrocious experiment."
3,"The Golden Era of Naval Aviation: An Aviator's Journey, 1939-1959",The fact that this is a very poor publication (quality of photos very poor) shouldn't keep readers from thoroughly enjoying this fine read.
3,Spanish Version of The Rock Cries Out,"Ok... same music, same voices as the english version praise album The Rock Cries Out. Spanish lyrics. Its an interresting thing to hear if you are used to english. Its not every day that you hear Spanish Rock. We took this one to Mexico on a missions trip and got good reviews there. And its a great way to learn the song in the other language for those that need to... for whatever reason.. :)"
4,Understanding the USA in 2003,"Fascism and Social Revolution may open your eyes to what you can see on the evening news or read in the newspapers everyday. Dutt's analysis of the economic, social and political events in Germany provides a wake up call. Reading this book can educate political activists. The movement to the political right in this country is running full speed ahead. Awareness is the first step towards action."
5,Not to be missed!,"My favourite Leonard Cohen album of all time is ""Songs of Love and Hate"". And it wasn't until I heard ""Recent Songs"" that I found an album that matched ""SOL+H""'s lyrical and musical beauty.After his ridiculous collaboration with Phil Spector - ""Death of A Ladies Man"" - , ""Recent Songs"" was a wonderfully welcome return to form. Among my favourites songs on this album are ""The Window"" - a beautiful song in the tradition of ""Last Year's Man""; ""Un Canadien Errant"", sung entirely in French by the Montreal born Cohen; ""The Guests"", ""The Gypsy's Wife"", and ""Ballad of the Absent Mare"".This is a must-own for any Leonard Cohen fan. And it should also be pointed out that this is the last album Leonard Cohen recorded before his voice transformed into the gravely sound which has been his trademark since ""Various Positions""."
4,"""But the rumors of my virtue, they moved her not at all ...""","I don't know how to describe this album. The songs it contains are beatiful, but somehow intangible. I am moved by the music and the words every time I listen, but when the album isn't on, I find them hard to recall. I guess I would say it's like a pleasant dream that evaporates upon waking. And that's not a bad thing."
3,He is a good song writer but...,You have to be in the frame of mind to listen to him. I've heard about him for years and I was interested in that European folk sound that he sings.I can say for me the stuff gets boring after awhile. I should have bought just a couple of songs I found interesting not a whole album. One thing that bugs me about some of his songs is that they sound like one big run on sentence. the songs aren't compelling enough for me and he tries to hard to make his lyrics clever. Another thing that I would like is just a stripped down acoustical album without the background singers those are the songs that I felt had more weight.I can tell he has songwriting abilities but I just find his work boring and tired sounding. I'll just stay with Dylan.
3,An oddity in a marvelous canon,"Being a transitional album, it's hard to view this in terms of Cohen's previous or future work. The songwriting remains strong, although stylistically there appears to be a lack of continuity. ""Un Canadien Errant"" is the very first French spaghetti western placed on a record anywhere. ""The Guests"" points to the density he would explore on future albums. ""Ballad of the Absent Mare"" is very much like his past catalogue, as is ""The Gypsy Wife"" and ""The Smokey Life"". For fans only."
2,For fans only,"I am a Leonard Cohen fan. I think he's great. This is not his best effort by any means. 'Came So Far for Beauty' is a good song that approaches his other work. For the rest ... Well - to each their own, but I have no idea where the folks who are raving about this album are coming from. Get it if you are already a fan and want to round out your collection/experience. If you are not already a fan start with one of his first two albums. Probably I should have given this 3 stars - it is Cohen after all!"
5,Expanding my Musical Horizons,I first heard this artist when my son visited me...he had several of her albums on his ipod. I intend to purchase more of her albums. A wonderful talent.
4,a few good songs,"i'm not a fan of these kind of music. but ""to the indian sea"" totally got my attention"
3,Deep Blue? Shallow Hue!,"The content of Ms. Matsui's latest effort does not live up to the title, ""Deep Blue"". As a devotee of one of Japan's greatest musical exports, I found many of the tracks disapointingly TOO SIMILIAR (SAME HOOKS) found in her earlier CD's, sans woodwinds. On the positive side, there were 2 fresh, lively tracks-(tracks 3 and 8) that make the purchase of this CD justifiable. In this writers' humble opinion, Keiko should get kudos and heavy airplay for the two certified winners, and a slap on the wrist for copying some of her earlier hooks that have been incorporated into many of the other songs offered on this CD. If you are looking for ""Dreamwalk"" style, hit after hit, smooth jazz, you will get beautiful piano playing in its place. The great thing about Keiko Matsui is that even her ""3 star"" CD's are superior to pretty much anything else out there in the same ilk. Buy it and enjoy it. There's nothing wrong with a little dejavu once and awhile."
2,Great features...all except reliability,"I bought this desktop in February, received and set it up March 2006. It has great features like being able to insert media devices on the FRONT of the PC, Lite-Scribe, etc., however, it crashed - either motherboard or hard drive - just five months after I bought it. HP was helpful and will fix it under the one-year warranty, but it should not have fritzed just five months after purchase!!!! I'm always very careful with my PC's, virus protection, firewall, turn off at night, etc., and hadn't even learned how to use many of the features before it crashed. Very disappointed. I hope it lasts more than another five months when I get it back. In any case, I won't buy another HP. Thank goodness for my trusty old Gateway which I kept after the ""new and improved"" PC came in, which is what I'll use until the HP is ""fixed."""
2,Too Flimsy even for Cats,"I purchased this DeerBlock Netting to use as a temporary cat fence in an area of our back yard. Needless to say, it was so flimsy that within 10 minutes my cats had run through it. If it can't keep a cat in, I don't think a deer would have any problems compromising this fencing material either."
1,Bird Netting NOT deer fence,"This netting is identical in every way to product honestly labeled as bird netting, other than the 7X100 dimension. It would be fine for that purpose, but it should not be sold as deer fence, which is much heavier. I should have known by the price, but the detailed product description is lacking the sort of information that would have confirmed my suspicions."
1,Very Light Weight for Deer Fence,"I purchased this material and installed it parallel to our existing wood fence, which the deer were jumping over. It is very difficult to discern how tough the various deer fencing products are based on the pictures on Amazon. When I opened the box, I was surprised it was not much heavier than the bird netting we use on our cherry trees.We installed the fence. The first night, the deer ripped several holes in the net. They just leaped right through it. We patched the holes with zip ties and put reflective flagging up, hoping the deer would see there was a fence, but every couple of days, they would just tear another hole in it.After two weeks, I took it down and replaced it with a Square Mesh Barrier Fence product I found online. The deer won't be getting through that."
3,a little on the flimsy side,"I bought this because I was being ""frugal""--I didn't want to pay the $56 plus shipping for the heavier weight material option--and now I'm sorry.Although this might do the trick, while I was putting it up it was tearing, just by my pulling on it a little bit. As my confidence in this product is slim I'm probably going to cost myself more in the end by now buying the more expensive option anyway. Bottom line, I don't want the anguish of putting in a garden, letting it mature and ripen beautifully, only to find that deer have gotten in and eaten everything in one dawn escapade. It's worth the extra bucks (pardon the pun) up front."
2,I'll use it again OOPS - had to throw it away.,"Bought it to keep rabbits out of vegetable garden. Split it in half to go around a 20'x60' ground level garden. Just step over to get in and out of garden. It is sort of hard to handle because it is rather light weight, unruly, and snags easily on things. I used tee posts about every 20' and tied with tie wraps. I left about a 6 inch ""skirt"" on the ground, turned it to the outside of the fence and weighted it with bricks. Dogs run into it. Grandkids run into it. Two snakes and a Texas spiny lizard got caught in it and died. One cottontail found an unsecured spot but it was generally effective in keeping rabbits out. I plan to buy more this year.UPDATE: I bought more. Had to take it down. Rabbits just cut holes in it (and the patches I made)and came and went at will. I've watched them come and go. Did catch and kill another spiny lizard, however. It was not effective for me and kills things I don't want killed. Replaced it with metal wire rabbit fence."
5,Safe Gardens,Deer are not my problem - squirrels and my beloved cats are. I have laid this netting over my garden beds and have not lost one plant to diggers or had my garden beds disturbed.I am very pleased with this product.
1,Do not buy the electronic sounds pumper for your toddler,"This toy uses no imagination. It is not sturdy. It falls over when you try to pull the hose. My grandson, age one used it as a pull toy! It is a total waste of money."
3,Pretty good,I hoped it would be a little bigger. I think the concept is great. The hose is a little stiff. The blue thing that you have the noise buttons has popped out a couple times. The kids were excited but haven't continued to play with it as much.
2,Gas pump,This isn't the greatest. My boys like the idea of filling their trucks with gas but this is not very realistic. It just doesn't interest them much. The sounds are pretty quiet and the toy is knocked over easily. They have been sitting/climbing on it more than using it.
5,Learn through play,"I decided to replace the discarded pump at my daughter's nursery school, since a lot of the kids were asking about it.The teachers there couldn't thank me enough because the kids were excited to see their pump again and loved to service their little vehicles."
3,"Cute, for what it is","My son likes this, however I think he'd use it more with his cozy coup if it was more realistic, or at least if the sounds were. It is very light so it is difficult to pretend to pump gas without the unit moving around a lot. I do wish the credit card slot would make a noise or something. My son loves to take his wallet out and slide his card, but I know he'd do it more often if it worked like the real thing. He LIVES in his car and loves to pretend play. I thought he'd use this more and know he would if it wasn't so flimsy."
1,Nice thought...,"When I spotted this adorable gas pump, I thought that it would make the perfect addition to my son's toy collection. He played with it for the first 5 minutes and then put it to the side. Twice in two years, he has pulled it around the house by the handle, but done nothing else with it. It's not very stimulating, and is a space hog for something that is only collecting dust. Nice thought, but not a real investment."
3,Pumper,I purchased this along with the Cozy Coupe but was disappointed with the pump. It is very light weight which makes it hard for toddlers to handle and they become frustrated with it. The electronic sounds are very low. Not the best.
3,It's durable - but fun?,"This toy was bought for my son's 2nd birthday. He didn't even play with it once. My daughter who is 5 attempted to play with it but the nozzle wouldn't come out of the hole. The toy is durable and the sounds are cute, but it just sitting in my son's room taking up space. I'm just glad I didn't spend more than $20.00 for it!"
2,Disappointed,When we received this product the stickers were all put on wrong and in some places they were folded up on themselves so that we could not reposition them without tearing. We had the toy less than 2 days and the electronics that produce the sounds died. We brought it to the a ToysRUs store and they said that there was nothing they could do - not even store credit. Very disappointing!
4,Great accessory for all those cars!,My son received this gas pumper with his cozy coupe police car and loves to fill er up on his own. He loves to watch me pump gas at the gas station and this makes him feel like a big boy when he can do it to his own car. We have 2 cozy coupes so he pretends to be the gas attendant while my daughter is driving and also tops his own tank off before taking off in his police car. The noises and real acting buttons give this toy the extra + over just a piece of plastic so he really feels that it is doing something and interacting with his imaginative play.
3,Needs twicking to stabalize toy.,"This is a fun thought for the coupe cars. However, upon opening the box, I was very disappointed, I expected more. The toy would be better if the bottom was weighted so that the pump does not tip over everytime. I thought the price did not justify the toy. The value was not there, (...) dollars for a toy that needs to be twicked by adults to be of use to the child does not warrant the price tag, (...) However, after drilling a small hole in the top and filling the pump with sand until the toy is stable then voila!!!! It becomes a fun toy, even if the pump is difficult for a toddler to insert into car gas tank."
2,cute idea....,This item was a christmas gift for my four year old boy and two year old girl they each have a cozy coupe so I thought it would be a cute addition to our backyard toy collection but to my surprise neither of them were very interested in it.I also run a home daycare and none of my students seem very excited about it either.I brought one of the cozy coupes inside along with the gas pump on a rainy day to spark new interest and still no-one seemed interested cute idea but not enough interest this is a twenty dollar dust collector in my house hopefully this is helpful to you and maybe if you do buy it your little ones will enjoy it better than mine
2,Not What I Expected,"When we received this product, the stickers were all put on already (very sloppily I might add) and we could not reposition them without tearing. It also arrived in a shipping box--not in a Little Tikes product box. Finally, the $19.99 price seems way too high for this very simplistic piece of plastic. For a Little Tikes product, I am surprised of the quality and price of this product. I am usually impressed with their products."
2,Not as great as I expected,"The album is only 37 minutes, which is the first disappointing thing about it, but not the only. Unfortunately, a lot of the humor seems timely, as in: it wasn't funny to me because this isn't the sixties. I think a lot of the references and humor are based around issues of that time or characters of that time. Our concepts of folk singers, of artists, of actors have all changed--perhaps not terribly much, but the cultural landmarks have shifted since this album. The 2000-year-old man is pretty good, but not even that was as hilarious as I had been led to believe. I'm going to give the album to my dad, as he knows the times (and the material) first-hand and I'm sure would appreciate it much more than I."
5,FUNNY,I looked all over for this album and was so happy that Amazon had it. I loved this when I first had it years ago and still laugh at it now. VERY funny
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTED DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN I RECVD. THIS ITEM IT WAS ONLY 1 DISC... AS I RECALLED THE ""ORIGINAL RELEASE HAD BEEN 4 DISCS..."
5,Mr. Reagan was God's Gift to America,"At a time when Americans measured their misery on Jimmy Carter's Misery Index, Ronald Reagan came on the scene with a clear plan, firm convictions and faith in the American people to pull ourselves out of hard times. All government had to do was lower taxes and get out of the way. How right he was... Everyone that is NOT paying 70% or 80% income taxes today should be thanking Ronald Reagan. Everyone that is not living behind a wall in East Berlin or behind barbed wire in the Eastern Block should be thanking Ronald Reagan for bringing about such change. I am old enough to remember Reagans original radio broadcasts. I listened to him and remember thinking... wow, I wish this guy would run for President. Listening to this CD brings that feeling back. We were very lucky to have had him for our president. Thank you Ronald Reagan and God Bless America."
5,The Series Is Complete,My Devil May Cry Anime series is complete now. At 2.89 that is to good to pass up. I love DMC.
4,Wanting more,The video is a good one. I only wish that this series would be longer than expected. It would leave you wanting more.
4,Many of Eva's best songs,"Very nicely written book including most of Eva's most popular songs. I particularly love the chords above the music to remind you what you need to do for each particular chord. Also nice is capo placement. If you are an Eva Cassidy fan, I recommend this book even if you are a beginner guitar player due to the ease of chords etc. I would have given it 5 stars, but some of my favorite songs are not in this book, so I need to figure those out for myself."
4,Accurate,We got this book because we were playing one of her songs at my cousin's wedding. The chord changes are very accurate and easy to follow.
5,Excellent Saucer,The saucer is very strong and almost invisible when placed under a pot.I've purchased them in several sizes and plan to purchase more.
5,Great Resource,Good details for hiking from your boat and how to find the interesting historic and archaeologic teasures in an already amazing area.
1,poorly researched and titled,"Mr, Kelsey apparently made a rush trip to Lake Powell to write this book, which is poorly researched and titled. It does not have much to do with boating on Lake Powell as it has to do with hiking into and out of the canyons surrounding Lake Powell. Mr Kelsey's blatent disrespect for the archeological sites that are unsecured is going to cause the loss of some of the treasures of the area, one's that will never be gotten back. His advice to visit them regardless of the fact that the National Park Service has asked for the sites protection to please not publisize or visit so as they may be preserved and cataloged is extremely disrespectful, on a number of levels. Poorly printed and photographed, unless you like seeing every ""foto"" in the book being one of Mr Kelsey. Overall a waste of money."
3,Boater's Guide Lake Powell,"Lots of information, pictures and maps. Print is so condensed, it makes it hard to read. Adding a map of Lake Powell with numbered reference squares to the detailed maps would make it easier to use. Not everyone knows all the names of the canyons..., but they know about where they are on the lake."
2,Not a great book for skiers,"Better suited for the adventurers. It did give decent descriptions but once I flipped through it, it was obvious that it didn't suit our water sport needs. Take advantage of reviewing a few of its' pages (if possible) before ordering to make sure it's what you're looking for."
2,Hard to Read,"The book has some good info and there is not much out there as far as detailed guides to Lake Powell but the print is small and really crammed in on the pages, it makes it very difficult to read and I have 20/20 vision. So the info is good but read it twice before you go or else you will have no use for it."
2,Not what I was looking for!,"I wanted a houseboating guide to Lake Powell. Although this book is full of detail about every inch of the lake, it is absolutely NOT user-friendly. The print is minute and the writing is atrocious. All of the maps are small and cluttered, and look as if they were done on somebody's home PC. All of the references are metric, which makes it extremely tedious to decipher. Although there is a metric conversion table at the begining, it was very frustrating to have to keep refering back to it. If you are looking for a basic, easy to follow guide, this is not the book for you! If I had picked it up in a book store and thumbed through it, I never would have bought it."
4,Good hiker's guide to the canyons around Lake Powell,"I used this book to plan a 4-day boating/hiking trip to the reservoir. Lake Powell's huge, with hundreds of canyons. Using Kelsey's maps and descriptions i was able to arrive at a list of specific destinations, and i had a great time. The book contains a lot of interesting local history too. Great literature it is not, but... so?"
2,This book is a waste,"It's called ""You Can Bet On It!""It should be called ""Here's some dumb stories that probably won't help.""This book is chock full of examples lacking both in explanation and instruction - it says what you need to do, but fails completely to explain either how or why. For example, the Handicapping section stresses the importance of handicapping. Well, any moderately intelligent person already knew that, but they don't know how, and that's really why they bought the book!Save the money to lose to a sportsbook."
2,smells great doesnt last long at all,"Paco Rabanne has a wonderful scent so far as the cologne is concerned. The Deodorant stick seems like a good idea but I was so dissappointed in how quickly it ran out. The stick practically ""liquidates"" and is way too soft. I think you would be better off developing a Paco Rabanne body wash or bar soap. JFM"
4,It was great,"I love this cd, though it has some slow songs on it. But to every slow song there is atleast 4 or 5 upbeat and great songs."
2,Not so much,This product was hard for us to see in the picture offered. It's weave was not as tight as indicated in the picture.
3,Very deep,"A bit difficult to enjoy without setting ones mind and heart to deep study.I would not recommend these volumes to someone without comprehensive knowledge and a deep background. Due to the age of the works, one should be expecting some anti-Jewish ideas, supersessionalism and bigotry. If you are prepared for that and aware of the last 200 years of Judeo-Christian relations, and open-minded it is possible to get something from this collection."
4,SIDE WALK SLAM!!!!,"I love this Cd! It plain rocks! I am not dissappointed although I had my doubts, but they were wrong. Tracks 2-7 are a bit repetitive but the rest plain rocks. Definate buy for fans of Pennywise!"
1,"Boring, uninsightful and a waste of a dvd disc","This video is just an attempt to separate Beatle fans from their money. There is nothing new or revelatory about this program. It is just a group of guys talking about the Beatles as if they had a connection to them or the filming of ""Magical Mystery Tour"". Save your time, save your money - just leave this tripe alone."
1,Not the show,Talking heads. Miniscule clips in the background but what you see are more talking heads.
5,wonderful series!,Read this series! You won't regret it. Michelle west is a fabulous author. I read the Elantra series but I am so glad I found these ones.
2,Inadequate copy - pass this one,"Completely inadequate copy of the standard. Difficult to read, as it is without chapter breaks. Does not include any illustrations, although the text repeatedly refers to illustrations. Don't buy this copy unless you have a full working knowledge of the information and just need a paperback with text for reminders. Definitely not for folks trying to learn about showing poultry!"
1,Not worth your time or money.,"Purchased this for my FFA and 4-H poultry members, there are no pictures the index is not accurate and there are no chapter breaks. It is not User friendly at all. Avoid purchasing it at all costs!"
3,A book that personal injury lawyers must also read,"This book may be good for insurance adjusters and is no doubt a jewel for Defense counsel, but it is an equal must read for personal injury lawyers as well. It is very readable and in plain English, which we all want, especially in dealing with what can be complex medical issues. It takes the confusion out of much of the medical literature. That is why it gets 3 stars, even if I do not agree with all of it. The book has a definite Defense slant, but it also confers such an expansive knowledge of whiplash issues that one cannot simply give ""the other side"" the advantage of sole possession of this knowledge. Personal injury lawyers should take equal advantage of this book and keep the playing field of knowledge level. There are parts that are quite neutral and informative regardless of what side of the argument you are on."
1,How come I have to give it one star,"Pain and loss of fun ction suck and so does this book. As a crookropractor I keep a copy of this book in my waste basket. I was going to sell it but no one wants it and its to big to throw out. It's as heavy as a telephone book and my neck and back are killing me now that I was rear ended in my Ferrari. All those god loving whiplash patients are causing all this pain. Calgon take me away. What did I tell all those people to do, oh man I forgot."
1,May Ferrari and buddies get a real good WHIPLASH injury,"As a whiplash chronic pain sufferer, all I can say for these ignorant folks is ""may you get a good one""....""may you get to know whiplash real intimately""...I am usually a very kind hearted person however, these people with their erroneous and damaging opinions should get a taste of what whiplash is really like for some of us. I have endured so much pain and to have these supposed ""experts"" express their views is incredibly frustrating...so, perhaps God will provide some justice..."
1,a reader,"I am sorry to say that this was probably the biggest waste of paper that I have in my library. Dr. Ferrari obviously is cashing in on his 'there is no late-whiplash' syndrome rampage. His reliance on his favorite Lithuanian study reminds me of the witnesses for the tabacco companies raising their right hands and swearing that smoking didn't cause cancer. I thought that doctors took an oath to first do no harm . . . Maybe not in Canada. His pollution of the literature with his tripe culminates in this most worthless collection of misinformation, and I pity anyone shallow or heartless enough to subscribe to his zealot rantings. Donate your money to charity. Don't waste it on this trash."
4,a splendid account which eschews the polemics,Ferrari has marshalled the medical and dental evidence about this contentious subject in a sophrosynic manner and in addition he has included research findings from other countries.This book is a great help to those who have had a whiplash in that they can follow a prudent therapy and not waste time and money on charlatans.
1,????,"As a practicing physical therapist, this book is fiction. It's written from the point of view of an academic without any clinical knowledge. I would not by this book."
4,A Fine Solo Album by a talented Singer and Songwriter,"As you know, Jack Russell has a great singing style, and an excellent vocal range. He is the voice on all of the Great White Albums, and he takes on a new direction with ""For You"". This album is filled with soothing, and heart-felt lyrics about the power that ""true"" love holds over us all. Having been lucky enough to experience true love more than once in my life, I completely related to Jack's well worded songs. This music is a bit softer than Great White, but that is because the songs are designed to place emphasis on the vocal mastery of Jack Russell. This album is similar to what Robert Plant has done apart from his years with Led Zeppelin. I only wish every song on the album was a winner. But like most rock albums, there are a couple of songs that are less than impressive. But I don't blame Jack Russell for anything I didn't like. He will always be a great singer, regardless of the style of music that he sings! Buy it!!"
4,Jack Russell's soft side,"This CD is heavy on very popish songs & ballads. It is definitely one notch softer than a typical Great White album. Nevertheless, it's a good CD for what it is."
5,Great carrier for older babies.,"This carrier has come in handy for carrying my 10 mos son(28 in, 21 pounds)through busy markets, parking lots, malls, when using a stroller is incovenient. This carrier is much easier to put together than the baby jorn, and it carries the baby in the same way I would have carry him naturally: in the hip. The weight feels to be well distributed and I've not felt any discomfort nor pain, and most importantly, my son seems to be comfortable too. I will recommend this product for infants over 5 plus months. Is well made and looks good."
5,Great power pop album,One of the best albums of its kind. Why this disc is out of print befuddles me.
4,Pretty Good,"You gotta luv these guyz. Esp. if your from Vancovuer you hear about them alot. This wuz there first CD and it's still kickin... It's good, but the other two albums are better *Bad Dreams and Monsters in the Cloest* Still, they can rhyme and Moka can sing. Gotta luv them!! Any CD of there's is worth every peeny!!"
1,"I may be from Ohio, but I'm no hick!","I have to agree with the person who said this book contains horrible stereotypes of Ohioans. I live in Columbus, which is one of the 20 largest cities in the United States. Other large cities in Ohio include Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Dayton. There are very few farms here, and I've never seen one remotely similiar to the one described in this book. Ohio is actually best known for the Ohio State Buckeyes (the 2003 NCAA Football Champions), and its ever-increasing crime rate. You would think that after an extremely inaccurate portrayal of Londoners in ""Lightning Strikes"", the ghostwriter would be a little more careful with this type of stuff.I've also noticed this trend in the other Shooting Stars books. Ice is from Philadelphia, so she's a poor ghetto black girl. Rose is from Georgia, so she's a somewhat inarticulate beauty queen. Cinnamon is from upstate New York, so let's make her some sheltered social outcast. Let's grow up a little, Mr. Ghostwriter, okay?"
3,ok,"I had found some of these at Goodwill and they seemed interesting so I got this one to complete the series I had, but they ended up not being as good as I had hoped. I've read others by V.C. Andrews that I liked so I was disappointed by these."
4,Sax Grooves Galore,"This is a very upbeat, funky, urban groove collection produced by Down To The Bone saxman Paul ""Shilts"" Weimer. It's hard to say anything bad about this cd other than the steady hip-hop beat does get a little monotonous after the first 4-5 tunes (as mentioned by the previous reviewer) & I would have enjoyed more extended sax solos. Every track is 5-6 minutes long and the only track that slows it down a bit is #9 - ""Your Place Or Mine"". My favorites are the title track and ""Mind The Gap"", which got me interested in Shilts when I heard it on a local jazz station. The 5th track, ""Short Island Iced Tea"" has a nice Latin flavor. I bought this cd together with ""Natural High - Pacific"", which definitely suffers by comparison. If you think Shilts is monotonous, Tim Best will put you to sleep on ""Pacific""."
2,Uninteresting party jams that don't hold the listener,"I picked this cd up based on a great review in Jazz Times magazine. The first two tracks are ok, but after that the cd became very repetitive and IMO boring. Each tune has pretty much the same canned drum beat and the bass player hangs on to one note for dear life. Shilts is a pretty good sax player who seems heavily influenced by Maceo Parker, but he's not someone I'd go out of my way to find out more about. None of the tunes stood out as being particulary good (or bad for that matter) although track 4 ""Down in the Village"" stayed with me because I swear the opening riff is Whitesnake's ""Slide It In"" (which doesn't surprise since Shilts has played with Jimmy Page, a contemporary of David Coverdale).I recommend passing on this cd unless you're just looking for background music for your next barbecue w/hip-hoppers and folks with some interest in jazz. Instead check out Maceo Parker's ""Funk Overload""."
5,great.................,"Great product, works well. Didn't arrive the first time sent, so seller resent promptly. Thanks so much!!"
4,Good but thin,"Good to place over plants and leave in place or move minimally. Strands are somewhat thin & if they get caught on something, they break. Easy to cut into smaller sizes."
3,not good for trees,"I bought the 14 feet by 45 feet to cover my peach tree. It was very difficult to put it on a 8 foot tree. It was also too narrow for my needs and I ended up with an open area that made the netting useless against squirrels and birds. I would not buy this if you intend to cover your fruit trees. This will be good for covering vegetables though. This would make a great ground covering, I also use it for strawberries and it is great in that respect.Overall, I am looking for something different for my fruit trees but will be purchasing this for my strawberry patch."
3,"Works, but I will never use it again","I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons, but with the help of another person and two long poles, we did it.) I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them. I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats. But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die. :( I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days. So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them."
5,This stuff is great,"Other than being ""sticky"" around sharp objects like twigs and limbs, this netting is perfect for keeping unwanted creatures out of our little garden. Very recommended."
4,It was a really good book but some things didn't make sence.,"I think that if some one is interested in sea horses alot, they should read this book. Really, if you like something like sea-horses, read it! I think it was a good book. The only problem is: I think people about 7 and under should read it. I think that someone my age, 11, would read through it real fast. But it's still a good book!"
5,bully-proof,"The series is perfect for predator proofing anyone, and has come in handy for me about 2 or three times in my life since 1998. I think it would also be the perfect way to bully proof youngsters who have to deal with America's public education system."
3,A good follow-up to the excellent Zimbabwe Frontline One.,"Zimbabwe Frontline Volume Two serves as good introduction to the mbria-based rhythms of Zimbabwean music. Leaning to the traditional side, this CD features the ever-present chimurenga of Thomas Mapfumo (Zimbabwe's most well-known bandleader), as well as the jit of The Four Brothers (feat. singer Patrick Mkwamba). Rhumba bandleader Jonah Moyo closes out the album in fine fashion. Zimbabwe Frontline Two is definitely a great addition to any CD collection. Less danceable than its other Frontline counterparts, Vol. Two provides a well-rounded and enjoyable representation of Zimbabwe's chimurenga guitar music."
2,not good for avid bird watchers,"this book is a great guide for backpackers who want to have a light load while on vacation. since there are so many birds in australia many are not included. i found several other books to be more informative, although they were much larger. there are good books available at national park visitor centers in austalia, and the price conversion makes it much cheaper to buy one out there"
1,Extremely disappointing,"""10 attitudes"" could have been a very nice film. But it's not. It fails on every single level.Where shall I start.Acting - wooden, forced, boring.Plot - has got a lot of flows. Lack of consistency.Sound - POOR! There are moments when it's impossible to hear the dialogues!Picture - POOR! The pictures must have been taken by an amatour.Yet another unsuccessful attempt to make a funny gay-theme comedy. Made in USA."
1,A high school movie project,"I would think with such big names that this picture would have had a higher budget for filming. You could hardly tell how bad the acting was because the film was bumpy, grainy and seemed like made from a home video camera. I am not one to mind when movies do the fake documentary look but this didn't even act like it trying to do that. It has a great story behind the scenes but could really be fleshed out. I recommend you skip this movie."
2,10 Attutudes,"I start by saying I have seen worse movies. Picture quality was poor but the concept was good it just could have been done better. Witty yes but some of the acting was wooden. It wasn't a total waste of money. However if we had the ability to sell as second hand here in Australia it would be in the 'For Sale"" bin."
2,"Boring, silly, unmoving flick","I guess if you're in the mood for some mindless, silly flick, then this little fluff piece might work for you. It's a little tired (man finds his boyfriend cheating and goes on a series of predictably comical dates until...) nothing.That's right, nothing. It ends with a thud. I got tired of the whiny lead and his ceaseless ""dates"" in this movie with little plot and no story. It reminded me of ""Lie Down With Dogs"" which was similarly semi-entertaining and similarly without point. But ""Dogs's"" pacing was better as well as its ending.I didn't recommend ""Dogs,"" even though it's better than this. I wouldn't bother with either."
4,Cute movie,"I thought this was a cute little movie. At times it was contrived, and stereotypical, but I guess something resonated in the movie with me. The movie is about Josh, a gay man in his 30s who finds out his boyfriend of 10 years is cheating on him with a younger man. His friend talks him into going on 10 dates. The dates I thought were kind of funny, he meets all these losers but maintains a humor about it that was funny. The ending I found to be overly cliche, where it is assumed that he starts dating the guy who made fun of him in school years ago. I thought it was a cute movie though that was fun to watch. Nothing groundbreaking or anything but just fun."
4,Satisfied Customer,"Humunga tongue is definitely good for people and pet amusement. My dog is a chewer, though, so I'm a bit worried he's going to chew the tongue part off of the ball. It's definitely hilarious and makes for great photo ops.Shipping was quick."
5,Think positive when you order......,"This is a great item for any shop and does fit into the holes of shop grade pegboard (4x8 sheets) from Home Depot, etc. The one disappointing aspect was in the shipping from Amazon; out of the five units I ordered, three were damaged in shipment. The small plastic tabs that hold the unit on the pegboard are very fragile and break easily. The shipping department needs to be more careful when packaging plastic items. When I wrote to Amazon this week concerning replacement, I was told the PB2 unit wasn't available from their supplier any longer. If you order, be prepared for that issue. Other than that, I would order more if they become available again."
1,JUNK.,"Item was received with most of the plastic pegs broken off. The pegs that remained weren't enough to hold any weight (one side of the organizer only had one peg left). The plastic pegs are way too delicate. This item is just plain junk, complete waste of money."
3,Don't like plastic pegs but convenient,"This product has plastic pegs that hold it to the pegboard. When it arrived some of the pegs had already broken off. However, it still stays on the pegboard so I didn't send it back. I haven't had any problems with it falling off but I would prefer metal pegs. All in all, I've enjoyed this product. It is very convenient for storing fasteners and small parts."
5,Excellent,I don't know what the heck Home Depot is selling (comment on other review) but I have 3 different types of pegboard in my shed (wood and metal) and it fits perfectly fine in all of them. This is a very well made product. I've owned three of these for over a year now and haven't had any problems with them. Here today to buy more.
1,organizer,"Pure garbage, cheap, not well built. Wouldn't be surprised to see these show up in the bargain bins up front in Home Depot where they dump other poor quality tools on people"
2,average product,was expecting alittle bit more from this product. didnt seem as though its very well made. i had to bend the latches abit to get it to fit. doesnt look like its going to hold up very well though.
2,ok...,"what you see is what you get. doesnt line up to our peg board holes, but we were able to kinda bend and wiggle it in. cheap."
5,Multi Bin Portable Peg Organizer,Very handy. Perfect storage container. Will be ordering more in the future.
2,lacks vocabulary,"Perhaps for basic 1-2 year Spanish, this dictionary may be adequate. However, anyone who wishes to read literature in Spanish will not find the vocabulary words they need in this dictionary. I speak from experience. Instead, I highly recommend the Oxford Pocket or the Oxford Desk dictionaries."
4,"Great braces, but a little hot","I have really bad knees and needed new braces for both knees for my daily 2-3 mile walk. These are great braces and provide good lateral support and patella support in the front. Unfortunately, they are hot (of course it's 90 degrees and 40% humidity this time of year where I live). The braces do dry out rather quickly if you lay them out after use and prop them open to let air flow through them overnight."
3,Decent for price,"Considering what this product costs it isn't too terrible. It is somewhat difficult to cut because it is more plastic than fabric. No stakes included so you will need to pick some up if you want to use them. I would probably use this for small section if you need something cheap, however, for large sections I would buy a higher quality weed fabric product."
4,Great for lining flower beds,"I like this weed block a lot because it's a little thicker than most I've used. The little bit of weight it has makes it much easier to use. I'll have to say, I still get a few grass patches sticking through it every once in awhile, but it could be that I didn't get the complete root out before I used the landscape fabric. I'd buy this again for sure."
2,Thin and plastic-like.,"This product, labeled as ""landscape fabric"" is very unlike fabric, and is more like the plastic bags that you find in your grocers produce section. It tears very easily, and the grass continues to grow (for a while anyway) under the ""fabric"" because of the level of light that gets through. Cutting it with scissors, it tears and rips, even with sharp shears.I would recommend using Scott's landscape fabric instead."
3,Easy to recognize plot device.,"Not up to previous high standards; this could be the bottom of the Morse mysteries. Easy to recognize plot device, and a wild guess will be as good as any."
3,"Good Dexter, Morse",This is vintage Dexter and vintage Morse. What I appreciated about this book is how the author took an aspect of a character (deafness) and built a classic mystery. This is a fine addition to the series.
4,Reviews somewhat harsh,"My only complaint is that this item is very overpriced. It works fine, looks nice, but I don't expect it to last more than a few years. I only use it to slice eggs, I would not recommend using it for anything else."
2,BROKEN,This item BROKE the first time I used it!!!! Would not buy this product again or any of there other things either!!!
2,Kitchen Kat 13505 B Cook's Series Egg Slicer,"I must be honest about this item, it appeared that this item has been used, I was not happy getting this item it does not and did not have the ""Kitchen Aid"" signature on it. I think this was a used item and I paid for a new item."
4,sure thing,The tape arrived packaged and in good condition. The seller lived up to promises made in quality of product and shipping time. I am fully satisfied.
5,Love this movie,if you're a john cusack fan this is a movie you must check out. Cute characters and a cute plot.
5,Silly fun,"I look at this lovely film as a precursor to Say Anything, and it's fun to watch them both in one night, if your kids will leave you alone long enough.John Cusack is excellent as always, and has a wonderful opponent in Daphne Zuniga, together they take off on a road trip and naturally fall in love. Rob Reiner kind of perfected this later on with WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, but here it's kind of imperfect and more touching because of it. Lots of great cameos from Tim Robbins to Anthony Edwards and so on.Worth a watch!"
4,Romantic teenage comedy - with an '80s feel,"John Cusack plays a university fresher lost in school work and failing hopelessly in romance too.It is simple, funny and charming, a film that can be watched time and again."
5,Cusack's best!,"great 80's comedy. John Cusack's best role-hands down. He is classic as Gib. Coming of age tale with great writing. No guilt involved, no strings attached-a Sure Thing!"
5,a very good one!,"Such a funny,exciting romantic comedy film I've ever watched! John Cusack is great! I like to watch it over and over again."
5,Great funny movie,"This is great.I pick this movie up one night at the video store thinking it was either a hit or miss. To my suprise, this was one of the funniest and engaging movies i had come across in a while. Cusack, in his very early days, is a natural in this opposites attract kinda teen romance with an also very young Zuniga.Watch out for Tim Robbins, in a bomb of a car... there a plenty of memorable scenes that will make you laugh well after the movie has finished. Highly recommended !"
5,An old-fashioned love story . . .,. . . disguised as another insipid 80s teen sex flick. What a wonderful surprise!
5,The Best Movie Ever!!!,"I first saw this movie when it was in the theaters and have loved it ever since. I have owned the VHS copy for several years and just got the DVD. I practically did a dance when I found out they were finally making it available. I couldn't tell you how many times I have seen it but it still makes me laugh out loud. I charged this DVD with Amazon on my credit card but honestly, it was an emergency!!! There is a great trivia track on the DVD which is perfect for Sure Thing obsessers like myself and some nice featurettes. Weird to see the actors (and Rob Reiner) all these years later. Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD. You won't regret it!"
4,A Fun Cusack-Driven Comedy,"Rob Reiner (""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Stand By Me"") directs another fun, spontaneous movie that is as entertaining as it is unique. Maybe it is another teenage romantic comedy that came out in the mid-eighties, but why does that mean it's predictable or cliche? It's another fun film that John Cusack can add to his list of classics. He delivers another stellar performance with every bit of his distinct flavor -- his off-beat humor, his sincere acting, and of course more female rejection. I recommend this movie to all Cusack fans, 80s teen film buffs, or just for anyone who wants to escape reality for 90 brief minutes."
3,What's Important,"This 1980's teen genre comedy is not as good as the earlier ""Ridgeway High."" It's not as good as ""Pretty In Pink"" or the other John Hughes movies. But it has its moments and certainly is far better than the awful ""Valley Girls"" which appeared in 83. Rob Reiner has an easygoing hand on the direction. He's not going to be remembered as Hitchcock or Ozu, but again, sweet comedy is Reiner's best stuff. I always found John Cusak movies vaguely unsatisfying. His roles are the smart aleck kid that revolts against middle-class etc... But in this movie of boy-girl opposites, he's good, even handsome in a Tom Cruse way. Alison Bradbury is fine as the anal co-ed, and thank you movie god, she's a brunette, not a blonde. This is a ""Road"" flick and the usual rain drenched hitchhiking scenes unfold. America is big and beautiful. Hard to miss with this material. The moral, getting laid is less important than finding someone you adore. Not a bad idea."
5,couldn't find it anywhere else!,We just love this stuff!! Couldn't find it anywhere else.... I like it so much I sent some to my sister!
2,Gangsta Bitch Barbie,These guys were better when they were gangsta bitch barbie. They got signed made one catchy tune and then made 10 more as close to the same sounding as they could them. Even throwing in some GBB songs with a new catchy radio friendly twist. Fred Durst is a suckbag and this cd kind of reminds me of Limp Bizkit.. so thats dissapointing. I know these guys can come up with something better.
1,Lame and Repetitive.,"Eh, The guitar work is at best...okay. It does indeed sound like Limp Bizkit, which is not a good thing. VERY formulaic. Very few of the songs stand out, and it all gets vrey tiring after but a few listens.There is nothing unique or new in the vocals, perhaps a touch of Rage thrown in with the Bizkit.Don't expect much."
2,Silent first,"Paul Hater is an international thief known for jewel steal. He know more than anyone can guess and may even lose an eye while trying to uncover facts. When Hater is arrested in possession of a stolen necklace, the police wants to persuade him to reveal the location of the rest of the collection by using every possible motive He remains silent and has to go to prison for twenty-year sentence. The International Detective Agency, acting on behalf of the insurers, must patiently await Hater's release before they can hope to find out more because they have tried all mean possible to get their fact to no avail. But just as his day of release approaches, Hater is kidnapped by a ruthless international gang determined to force the secret from him and prepared to go to any lengths to do so. What a damn mishap. A freed prisoner isn't free yet."
5,"Haunting, Profound Work of Art","This book is a pure and simple, masterfully crafted work of art. It is the rare book that can bring tears to my eyes, and this one did, easily and unexpectedly. It is short, simple, concise, beautiful and so profoundly moving. It will surely stay with any reader long after it is put down."
4,I would like to learn contents from book,"To Whom It may consern I would like to buy this book. Therefore I have need some nformation it. If you could give a knowledge this book which contents and index, I will be very happy.For Example: As you know that ICMSF,1986, Microorganizms in Foods vol 2. Samling for Microbiological Analyss, Principles and Spesific Application for Foods. 2 nd. edn. University of Toronto Press. This book is very useful for working Turkish codex. But I have'nt got all of the copy it. With best regards Betul Faika SONMEZ Agricultural Engineer and Food Technology Chief of Food Control Primary Health Care Ministry Of Health Ankara/ Turkey e-mail: bsonmez@saglik.gov.tr e-mail: betulsonmez@usa.net"
5,I Love Honees,I Love Honees Menthol Candy. It reminds me of my childhood. My Mother used to buy them for me. I loved the minty taste and the honey treat inside. Buy it you won't be sorry.
3,Disappointing,Ordered these for my son. He won't use them since they are uncomfortable and way to large for his hands. He says they are annoying.
2,The product is fine,"The product is ok, but to tell you the truth...we just dont use them. It is sort of a pain to get the controllers in place on the gloves and it doesn't really do anything for you performance wise."
5,Nice for playing wii,"It is so funny to play box at wii with this pair of gloves, you can really feel the emotion and it becomes a great experience at the same time."
2,strange fit,"I tried using it yesterday in my cardio routine with a workout video for wii that I got and the wii remote doesn't fit well, it wasn't much fun using it. They fit strange."
3,Boxing Gloves,"I like the gloves, but the game has an option for 2 remotes and the gloves only give you an option for a remote & a nunchuck, which means you have to squeeze the other remote into it and then it doesn't have the same sensitivty to the sensor. But overall I like having the gloves they give you a little extra weight for a little more sweat."
1,wasted my time,"these are listed as everlast boxing gloves. obviously now that you brought them up, you see they are not in fact everlast boxing gloves per se but rather a game adjunct toy.as such just looking these up wasted my time hence a one star.but i might add; i did buy everlast gloves ...actual ones...but be warned, mine had a heavy chemical smell that just would not go away...made in china...so with all the bad news about the safety of items coming from china, i would not at all take the risk of putting these on anyone's hands...do you want whatever creates that horrid chemical smell to be absorbed by your body? not i."
1,Just using the controllers works better...,"I bought these in hopes that it would feel more like actual boxing. Unfortunately, the holders (on the gloves) seemed to interfere with the WII controller = not as responsive as just using the controllers without the gloves. So, I like the idea. I just wish the gloves worked."
2,Average at best,"I loved the author's Stranded and bought this books after reading the reviews, which suggested that this book was more of the same - an hilarious page-turner that I wouldn't be able to put down. However, this was anything but the case. The book was boring and predictable. There were a couple of twists in the book but even they were underwhelming."
3,"Mixed bag, mixed styles","This CD is extreme fundamentalist Christian -- for example, the song Chicken Soup ridicules the theory of evolution (""You can make soup / From any chicken in the coup / But you can't make a chicken from [primordial] soup!"" It's a weird album, as there are some relaxing, adult-style, less-overly-religious acoustic songs, but you also get songs with kids singing ""I love Jesus."" However, the ultra-relaxing ""Backwards In The Back"" makes this entire CD worth it, regardless of your religious views."
2,Not a proper tribute...,"Listening to ""Midnight in the Patch,"" I found that I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the covers created by ""Goth/Industrial"" artists. First of all, many ""Goth"" artists take offense at the naming of the album as a ""Goth/Industrial Tribute."" These bands, they say, do not typify all goth artists. Secondly, I find very few of these songs to be enjoyable, much less acceptable covers of one of the greatest alternative bands ever. I found the vocals to be shamefully bad. It was a valiant attempt, but it fell short in every way."
1,This is not a Tribute.,"I can't believe how bad Tribute albums have become these days. It's bad enough that most bands today lack any original creativity. I'm tired of these boring independent label Tribute albums, the only good company is Cleopatra Records. All the other labels that spew out Tribute albums have the worst production on them. I could not even listen to this album. This album is so boring and tedious that I literally fell asleep half way through the CD. The songs are so mismatched too. When you start putting out a ska or polka version of a Smashing Pumpkins song, then you know this idea is completely wrong. I'll wait for a true Tribute album to come out for Smashing Pumpkins. Feel free to pass on this ""tribute"" album to save time and money."
1,If you are going to buy this here's your warning,"Most of the songs were pretty crappy, although the all instrumental ones ( Disarm; Mayonnaise; Tonight, Tonight) were kinda cool. It's always interesting to hear other people's take on a beautiful song.Stand Inside Your Love way okay, and I actually liked Try Try Try.But there are two songs which left me with a puzzled look on my face. Today- What is that, Polka? And Rhinocerus-Huh?Some of the songs were ruined by the people singing. Bullet With Butterfly Wings and 1971 could have been okay but then the droning starts. Are they trying to immitate Billy? He could sing the ABC's and make it sound emotional, these people sound bored."
1,Bad Tribute - Not good.,The Smashing Pumpkins are one of the best bands ever. The covers on this CD stink. None of them do a good job at the songs. I think I have said enough.
2,Seems like bad Tribute CD's are in the air lately,"While this one is better than the Gothic Tribute to The Smashing Pumpkins, this one still falls completely flat. Please, stop making Smashing Pumpkins Tributes, you're music should not be associated with them in any way."
1,returning item,"the item was defective and had missing pats and some minor damage, it was not what I expected it to be"
2,Really fun for 15 seconds,"And then it crashed - both wings cracked and one of the engines fell off. Tried to glue/tape and found this was difficult to fly for an adult without crashing. And when it gets too far out of range it will also crash. Crash, crash, crash and in the trash."
1,The worst plane in the world,"this is the worst plane in the world, it flies only 3 m, and falls to the ground The engine is weak, the glue was dry and only works as rc car"
1,hate it,i love all r/c things. this does not take off!never ever buy it!it just drives in a circle for 3 seconds then looses power and brakes and snaps in half.i hate it so much.it says $30 but with free shipping they charge you $60 dollars in flieing fees.
1,Very Good if You enjoy Sticking Thermocol with Glue.,It arrives well packaged in a Semi-knocked down condition. As you start assebling it.. the thermocol parts already stuck with glue start falling apart. The manufacturers have anticipated this and have supplied a small tube of Glue... but the tube contains dried up glue... After a little effort and some fresh glue you get it all ready to fly and you realise.. it does not work...Makes for a good showpeice or a Model to explain the kids the principles of flying and aviation.. expecting anything else.. would be dissapointment.
1,"Sucks, broken and used.","I recived this plane just a few days ago. I was excited for it was my first rc plane and i was hoping this would jump start me into the hobby of flying rc's a little bit. So far this is disapointing. The plane dosen't fly. It only goes full throttle and half, also mine only goes right, no left turn. That caused me to crash twice. The plane also has a high stall speed, which isnt to good comparing speed is what you need to climb. Also when I was putting the plane together the glue that was included started to eat the foam around it. I later wiped it up and put elmers glue on which worked ok. Overall i would reccomend saving your money for something more of quality. Im going to return this item and save for a proper plane. Someing 3 Channel and not a piece of #@$!"
1,Didnt last long!,Seriously it took longer to put this together than it lasted after a couple of semi-rough landings!
1,disappointment,"I purchased this as a chiristmas present and the plane broke on it's ""maiden voyage."" My husband and son were very disappointed. The plane can not be controlled once it starts nose diving. You can only turn it right or left. Not worth the money nor your time."
1,Horrible!,"Well, I got Super Sonic Radio control RC...I was not able to make it work... after the second try one of the helice didn't work again.I think is trash!Don't buy it!"
4,Not bad for the price,The plane is made for beginners so it's fairly inexpensive. The engines are pretty good and sufficient enough to get some height and distance. The construction is glue and two sided tape so you have to use a little bit of care with it. Don't fly it into trees and your ok. As long as you purchase this as a beginner you should be happy. If you are expecting to do some aerobatic stunts then you will probably need to add several hundred dollars to your budget and not even bother with this little guy. My son (5) loves it and gets a big kick out of playing with it and that's all I cared about.
3,OK for the money,"For the money the plane is OK, Charging system is nice and convenient. Plane is just Styrofoam so it is not very durable. Due to the lightweight construction and small engines it must be flown in 0 wind. Decent for an 8 year old's first plane"
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this plane,"I know this is an inexpensive plane but really don't bother. We only got three flights out of it before it was trash. The first time it ""flew"" for about 15 seconds before taking a nose dive in the ground. This mashed in the nose and knocked the wing off. Home to glue it back together and recharge battery. Next day it ""flew"" for about 20 seconds before nose diving again and doing more damage to the nose and knocking the wing off again. Back home to reglue and recharge. Third time up and another nose dive and broken wing.When it does fly you really have no control. you can try to turn left or right but it doesn't help much and forget any kind of controlled landing. After each ""landing"" you can expect more damage to the nose and body.Do not buy."
3,"Well, the production's on point...","Seriously, the production couldn't get much tighter, but the lyrical redundancy is UNBEARABLE! Listen to Madchild's stunning words of wisdom: ""I'm a bad man/ baseball bat in your brains, like Bam Bam/ Ask me... if I give a damn."" HOW CAN SUCH NICE BEATS BE ACCOMPANIED BY THIS? My God... PEACE!"
3,It's Like the Reverse of Jay-Z,"Much like Jay-Z seems plagued by occasional sub-par producers, Swollen Members seems to be the opposite. A great producer(s) stuck with mediocre members... Listen to the hook on 'Horrified Nights' and then try not to laugh at the weak attempts of the lyricists to keep up with the intelligence of the music. The dime store lyrics don't do justice to the beats and hooks, which come through like the love child of Dr. Octagon and RZA.Hopefully the producers read this and hook up wih some worthy rappers (Blackalicious or Guru, maybe?), otherwise..."
3,Starts Strong - But No Staying Power,"I give this CD 3 stars because the first two songs (""Who Am I?"" and ""The Love For Me"") are very strong, catchy songs that show Lily's melted-vanilla-ice-cream voice. The rest of the CD is not as great as it could be. All in all, it's not a BAD CD...just not very...memorable. Her newest, ""Situation"" promises to be better."
4,Great toy,Our 3.5 year old son loves it. He was able to learn how to operate it within one day and likes riding it. There is no risk of it tipping over (as we had seen with his trike) and he enjoys the control he has riding the vehicle. We also love the fact that he has to use the pedals to ride it which gives him a chance to utilize the endless amount of energy he seems to have.Would definately recommend it to another child. One point weakness though:The front steering is not protected - he hig a concrete step causing the steering bar to pop out - no problem - it could be pushed back and he could continue to ride it without problems.
1,false advertisement,"I looked all over for a peddle powered ride on vehicle for my son that wasn't for a toddler. I thought that I had found the perfect Christmas gift when I saw this Kettler Kettcar. My son is 6 and weighs 57 lbs. This item was advertised as suitable for 8 to 12 year olds and able to hold up to 120 lbs. My sons knees are up almost to his chest and it's difficult for him to peddle. I cannot return this item because of the fact that ""Santa"" gave it to him but I feel totally RIPPED OFF!!!!! This was total and complete false advertising when my 6 year old can't fit into a go-cart advertised to fit 8 to 12 year olds. Don't buy this item unless you have a very small, young child."
1,an attempt to rip off the popularity of Colin Tipping's best seller,I agree with the reviewer Mr./Ms. Cooper who pointed out that this book doesn't hold a candle to Radical Forgiveness by Colin Tipping. Ms. Barnhill's use of the bestseller title seems to me to be an attempt to grab some of the market of folks seeking Tipping's wisdom. Barnhill's concept and her book itself trivializes the depths of what it is that Tipping attempts to get across in his book. Shame on Julie Ann Barnhill for not coming up with a title of her own and for her publisher for this shameless marketing strategy.
1,Radical Forgiveness: It's Time to Wipe Your Slate Clean!,"Not to be confused with the excellent Radical Forgiveness, Making Room for the Miracle by Colin C. Tipping!!"
1,wouldn't buy again,"Get one that is filmed in the ocean not a tank. The film quality is low, nothing is in focus, and the lighting is poor. I would not purchase this item again."
1,Clearly (pun intended) this is a no buy,"I second the previous review, ""The film quality is low, nothing is in focus, and the lighting is poor. I would not purchase this item again."" Big disappointment."
4,Great cable but what is up with the packaging,This is an excellent set of component video cables. They are constructed very sturdy and fit very tightly in the ports so you don't have to worry about anything ever coming loose. But what drives me crazy (and the reason for only 4 stars) is the packaging. Why on earth do cables need to be packaged like Fort Knox???? I realize theft is a concern but there must be a better way to package them so it doesn't take an hour just to get the cable out of the industrial strength plastic. And I can't imagine the cost of the packaging. If any cable manufacturer and packing company reads this PLEASE think about more customer friendly ways to package cables. Someone needs to take the first step to change what has become an industry-wide nightmare!!! :)
5,The best band you've never heard,"This is one of the best live recordings available by any band in any genre. ""Roadhouse blues"" serves as a good general description of the music on ""88"", but it's infinitely more than that. The Seventy Sevens start from a blues foundation that blossoms into catchy, captivating tunes performed with the kind of passion, integrity and virtuosity that makes one ask, ""How come they never hit it big?"" ""88"" will knock your sox off. Buy it!"
5,INCREDIBLY COOL-ONE OF THE ALLTIME BEST LIVE ALBUMS EVER!,"I had known of the Seventy Sevens since my dad met Mike Roe while mastering his album at Ralph Stover's studio. He told me they were a prog band, and finding their EP and Mike Roe's 7&7iS album at a flea market confirmed this. A few months later, at the same flea market, i found 88. I had no idea the 77's were a blues band, and was surprised by their fantastic guitar work on the album-because their EP lacks complex lead guitar work. All in all, a five star album."
3,Go All The Way Does not Deliver All the Way,"The product itself arrived fast and in excellent condition.The music on the album, however, represents a decline in the Isley Brothers' musical influence.Even if what Chris Jasper said in the jacket (that more and more he was writing the songs to be sung by the younger members) accounts for a different musical shift, it still sounded way too stilted and not as vibrant as their previous outings. In short, it was way too old for a group, that by even the early date of 1980, had become living legends.I still enjoy the songs, especially ""Say You Will"" and ""Here We Go Again"", but it was only because of Ronald's voice that the songs got anywhere at all. His vocal stylings and quality are what makes the songs listenable. But there was too much programming and not enough rawness, and the improv that was done was in the predictable places. ""Go All The Way"" was a good endevour, but did not accomplish what the album title's intentions."
5,Yes!!!!!!!!!,"Man, I can't believe I found this on CD. I really thought this was out of print. This brings back a lot of memories! Amazon...you're the best!!!!!!"
2,go all the way,"the boys were running out steam on this track not some of their best work,but if you are atrue fan buy it."
4,Perfect for Preschoolers!,"My son loves this 4 pack of DVD's. With four to choose from, we don't get overly bored w/ the content. What's great is that it's educational, too."
5,"Enthralls my ""spirited"" child","My son is 3 and is what you might call ""spirited."" We have all they typical DVD's that are action-packed and fast paced and they will interest him for a few minutes before he is off ""multi-tasking"" and playing with toys. Mighty Machines, with its slower pace, and interesting (albeit cheesy) characters my son will actually sit and watch the DVD, giving him some much needed down time whenever he starts to get a little manic. It is not documentary and doesn't go into much detail on how or why things work, just leisurely paced video of big machines in action. After watching the DVD's he will often playing nicely with his toy trucks and repeat things he's seen or heard on the DVD.I would highly recommend these DVD's to any parent of children who interested in big things."
2,Boring and not formatted for wide screen TVs,"Not formatted for big screen TVs so images are distorted. The four DVDs are boring. There is excessive detail without meaningful information. For example: Getting a race car ready: hand remove nuts, deflate tire, remove from rim, check tire, tire good so return to rim,etc. Does not explain why or how the tire is checked or what made it good enough to put back on. It would be OK to sacrifice action if there were some interesting and true information being given. We have some old big machine VHS tapes that are very action packed and give some relevent information without being boring. I wish I could find something like that in on a DVD."
4,Great for the Grandson,"""Mighty Machines"" 4-DVD set is just what we needed for those rainy spring days when 'outside' just isn't going to happen. I bought these for my almost-three year old grandson, and Mom says they're a hit. An earlier reviewer was disappointed because they didn't include letters or numbers or other 'educational' enhancements. So what's wrong with FUN???"
5,Amazing photos fo the human body,I work in the health care field and the photographs in this book are the most detailed I have ever seen. They are amazing in their detail The comparisons to other living things in nature are fascinating. I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in how the human body functions.
4,Good short term solution,"Moved to a new state, and had to wait a week for furniture delivery. Bought this mattress and was able to camp out at the new place in comfort. And, now have an easy-to-use guest bed. Needed to add about 45 seconds of air several times, but otherwise, was just great. If it was several inches higher, would have been even better."
2,Seam split within 9 months...,Thought this was a good one but one of the seams on the top came undone so there is a huge bulge and no one can sleep on it anymore :/
1,Hitting bottom....,"Very disappointed with this air bed. While inflating was easing and quick, we also found on it's very first use that it looses air quickly. Within an hour we were laying as if we were on a chaise lounge chair, with our butts hitting bottom. Not a comfortable night. Nor was the next night after we inspected for leaks...found none, and tried again. But more deflation. Do not recommend."
1,Problem with intex mattress,"I had the mattress for a month, now there is a big lump in the middle. The mattress also loses air quickly. I was disappointed and would not buy again."
2,Semi-comfy mattress that lasts about 3 months,"I have went through 4 intex mattresses now. I swear, I keep them in their bag, in the closet and when I use them, they are used on carpet. For whatever reason, after about 3 months, they start losing air. We can't even find a hole in them (with the exception of 1, which WAS our fault). One of them just lost its ability to DEFLATE after a little while. Overall, these are really cheap mattresses, while pretty comfy, are just not durable. I am going to spend more money and get a more durable one. I could've bought a $200 super rugged mattress by now!"
2,Not satisfied,I wasn't satisfied with my purchase and I returned it. It started leaking from the first day. I don't recommend anyone to buy it.
5,"Easy, practical.","No problems at all. Good suprise, real fast and easy to use. No complaints. Confortable enough. Realle recomemended for unexpected visitors..."
1,DOA: Dead on arrival...,"We bought this for our houseguests to use during the holiday season. Unfortunately, it was DOA: dead on arrival. Wouldn't inflate because it had a hole in it already. The repair kit was missing the glue. Wonder if this was someone else's return? Anyway, Amazon took it back and processed a quick refund."
5,review,The product is much better than I thought before I bought it. I like it very much as it is large enough and the leaking is very very weak. It is a good choice with this price.
2,Intex is not all that....,"The airbed starts out fine but after a few uses the welded seams start to give out and you get these big bubbles n certain sections. This happened with ne of he queen sized and the twins,and of course it all happens after the time that you can exchange them."
4,Good Value,"I purchased this air mattress and the Intex Nylon Flocked Queen air mattress. I think for the pricing difference this less expensive Pillow Rest Queen air mattress is the better choice than the more expensive Flocked mattress. Both worked well, needed a little more air added after a few days, both inflate and deflate quickly. I have owned other air mattresses in the past, low profile instead of the high profile of these two. BEWARE that the higher profile air mattresses allow more body heat to escape than the low profile, so be sure to insulate with blankets under you as well as over you if you are sleeping in cold conditions."
3,Loses it pillowiness in 4 hours,"My fiance and I went on a road trip with this air mattress, and were impressed the first night as we went to bed. About 4 hours later I awoke with a cramp in my arm and I was holding on to the edge of the mattress for dear life, so I wouldn't roll into my fiance. I turned over to see how my fiance was doing, and he also was holding onto the edge like a life preserver.I will say the one pro is the inflation process. It took minutes, and if we mustered the energy four hours into our sleep we just turned it on, and it would inflate with us on it.I guess thats what happens when you don't spend the extra money on a Aero bed. We've both slept on those before, and they were awesome.Overall, for the money it was good, but don't plan on having perfect sleep unless your a teenager."
1,Leaked brand new~,"I bought this, left it in the box two months before I decided to try it out. Took it out of the box, inflated it(which was pretty fast), woke up with a sore back, because 1/4 of the air leaked out.Horrible."
1,Great...while it lasted,"I bought this mattress 9 months ago. I use it primarily when I go visit people or when someone comes to visit me, which isn't all that often. I'm only 190 ans use it by myself, which definitely doesn't exceed the weight limit. About 7 months (maybe 8th night being used) one of the wavebeams separated and caused for a giant bump on the one side of the bed about 10-inches above the regular sleeping height. It was only one beam now making two so I didn't think much of it (other than it obviously being faulty). Yesterday I blew it up for the first time since and when I woke up this morning I was almost pushed off thr bed; the second wavebeam seperated as well, making for a giant bump that's bigger than a second person.I loved how comfortable this bed was the other times I used it and recommended it to my friends, but now it is essentially completely unusable."
1,Seems good but does not last long,"I bought this airbed couple of month ago. Two people can easily sleep on it and the pump comes in very handy but unfortunately it lasted only 1 month and all the walls that separate the chambers detached from the surface and exactly one night after that the bed was completely out of air! Buying this kind of mattress was a big mistake. If you want one to last-long, go for a bed with just one chamber."
5,Best Air Mattress EVER,I bought the air mattress for my niece's home in Chicago. She said she had a futon to sleep on for her guests. I just spent the weekend with her and the mattress was WONDERFUL!!!! The queen size is the height of a normal bed and OH SO SOFT!!!I recommend this to anyone looking for a great bed at a great price.
1,Most TERRIBLE air-bed EVER - Lasted only 1 week,I bought this air bed in queen size and after 1 week following things happened:1. The line separating the pillow and the rest of the bed blew up and made the bed crooked.2. Next day all the separations blew up and the bed was like a balloon.Moreover the bed is really uncomfortable because of the separating lines and causes back pains in the morning.Buying this bed was the biggest mistake ever and I hope that I can get a refund.Bottom line- DO NOT BUY
4,Airbed,The airbed iss comfortable; howerver the the ridges (lines) in the bed do make it a little uncomfortable at times.
2,too small,"bed is too small, not a queen. Also it is made so that both people roll to middle. Buy 2 twins instead of this"
4,airbed,"I used the intex pillow airbed and was very satisfied with its comfort and how easy it was to use, Inflating it was very easy, deflating, more of a challenge to get alll the air out so it coould be stored. Because it wasn't totally airless, getting it into the bag was a llittle difficult for one person to do."
5,Excellent product,After reviewing the costs between Aerobed and Intex we decided to purchase the Intex Pillow Queen Airbed. I find no reason to pay the price for the Aerobed as the Intex is equal in quality. I would recommend the Intex products to everyone.
4,It's a good deal,"I bought this online and it deflated the first night I was frustrated because when it was full it feels so very good!! So I gave it another shot and bought it locally...it's really a good night sleep, I put a memory foam on top with my favorite sheets and I wake up feeling really good. Less aches and pains I'd recommend it."
2,Lasted 8 months,"I bought this mattress 8 months ago and it slept one average sized adult on a regular basis. When it worked, it was great, extremely comfortable. Then all of a sudden one night one of the seams in the middle broke and it became one large bubble. It is now unusable. Very disappointed because had that not happened, it was great. I did read that this had happened to others but I figured it wouldn't happen to me. There is no way to fix it. I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Did not receive credit for returned order.,I purchased an Airbed for Christmas guests in early December. I did not use it or open the packaging. I returned it promptly but still did not receive a credit and it is almost March. I have tried to contact the seller but could not.
1,Junk,"I purchased this air mattress while I was moving into a new house and waiting on my furniture. It seemed good at first, then all the air cambers separated inside after a few days of use and became useless. I've owned other air mattresses before and this was the worst. I give it zero stars, but 1 is low as it goes. After I bought it, I might as well put straight into the garbage. What a waste of time and money. To think this company is fill up our landfills with this crap."
1,"Fair price, but it really sucks","Well, at first, I was really satisfied to buy it at this price with free shipping, and it looked good when it was inflated at first time when I bought it on Last November, I thought it should have been used at least half a year or longer, but it was totally a kind of tragedy, after the first month, the bed became out of shape, it should have been kept in rectangle, it became a round one, ok, I didn't care about it, anyway, it still worked functionally. But things went worse, until last week, it automatically deflated when I heard ""bang"", I was so scared,i could not figure it out what was wrong with it. Thus, if you really need a bed, choose a really mattress and bed box, not like me who just want to make it temporary, the truth is the inflatable bed cannot last long, the quality of this stuff really sucks."
1,Ehh,"The bed was only used for 4 days, but the 4 day the bed had a air bubble. there is a huge air bumb on the right side, the bed is higher on the right side then left. Im sure you can find something better , if you paying money for it."
3,Positives and negatives,"Positives:Powerful built-in pump inflates mattress quickly and quietly.Added height makes it easy to get on and off mattress. Not outrageously expensive.Negatives:Material and construction not as sturdy as claimed. Built-in ""pillows"" are too low, and adding your pillow on top make it too high. Pump located at head of mattress, which makes it difficult to get to. Not as comfortable as my old air mattress with ""individual coil"" design.UPDATE: Barely a month, the wall that separates the chambers have popped, causing a big hump in the middle of the mattress. Looking for the 90 day warranty in the manual, but there is nothing. Save your money, this is a POS."
5,guest loved it,I got this for my sister and her boyfriend to sleep on New years eve and they said it was very comfortable and that they slept well on it. It does smell like plastic so make sure you use a sheet on it.
2,Good if you plan to use for very small period,I have bought this in June/July2009 time frame. The unit is good if you want to use it occasionally for small duration. Once I have to use it for a stretch of 3-4 weeks and thereafter the size of the Aired increased and now it is bigger than a king size bed. So please use caution before buying and keep your intended use in mind. It isn't meant for long term usage.
2,600 Pounds May Be A Longshot,"Bought the bed in Sept 2010. It is easy to use, very comfortable and comes with a great price.However, a week ago, it suddenly developed a hump consisting of popped cell(s) in one entire half of the bed, and last night, with a loud sound and a heavy jolt, it violently woke me up from sleeping on the remaining side, nearly throwing me off. My weight is below 180, and this should not happen, even if used daily (for practicability, mobility and small space).Have to buy a new air bed, because there's no real guarantee; the 600 LBS are merely implied."
5,Air Mattress,"I needed an air mattress for visitors since I have a 1 bedroom apt. and although I have a comfotable couch, this matress accomodates visitors that are able to sleep together as a couple and prefer a better arrangement other than sleeping separately on my couch............"
4,"Worked Great for 6 Months, but then Busted",Used as my bed with a 4 inch memory foam layer thrown on top. Most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. But after 6 months of use one the of the seems broke on the top and bubbled out. Its now just unusable. However it lasted pretty long for me so I liked it.
3,good,great for my parents when they come to visit (they are older and its hard for them to get up and down) Iv used it 15 times in the last year iv had it and its just now poped a hole.
1,Index pillow rest,It was suppose to be long term use. This was not the case. The seems came apart after 2 to 3 weeks of use
1,Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built in Electric Pump,"I am extremely unsatisfied with this product. One month after I purchased the product, the walls that separated the pillow rest and two of the sides were completely detached. I also found one hole and although I was able to patch it, I found another hole a few days later. All of this started happening one day after the return deadline passed. Do not buy this product, it is a waste of money!"
2,terrible air mattress seems great for about one month,"Bought this air mattress and thought finally an air mattress that might not leak, or deflate while I am sleeping on it.Well, that was wishful thinking, however it doesn't leak or deflate it is worse than that. Approximately two or three months later I was sitting on the mattress and I heard a loud pop, seems the air in the mattress moved to on side of the mattress and now it has a mountain on one side and a perfectly flat area on the other side it looks like there is a three hundred pound thing sleeping on one side of the mattress absolutely even and comfortable. The opposite side of the mattress is inflated more than twice the height.I deflated the mattress and inflated it again but this had no effect I could not do anything to the mattress to pump air into it providing an even surface. Total waste of money and I will never purchase an Intex product again as long as I am living.Unsatisfied disappointed customer"
5,A must have,Great to have for guess. It fully inflates in 3 minutes and deflates fast. Very comfortable to bed on. I'm glad I brought one.
5,Good deal great quality,It came on time. The air bed is great. The built it pump makes it easy to pump air in and out.
1,Don't buy it,The air bed didn't last 3 months. It fits two people with a combined weight of 295 pounds. It is well built and was used everyday but it lasted less than 3 months.
4,so far so good,"bought this for an emergency for when guest spend the night, seem to work well. very inexpensive bedding. o k to buy"
1,Holy unchambered batman,"OK so at first: awesome. It was great. I used it in my living room as a cheap replacement for a couch, before I bought one. with in 45 days one chamber seemed to overinflate and stole air from other chambers requiring more air in then was needed. Then I got that fixed as it became two ... wait fixed I mean made worse my bad. Recently I re-inflated it and 1,2,3 chambers were over inflated and well was oddly comfortable (for one person) then chambers 2,3 combined at some point. The best part... tonight I was laying there watching TV had my glass of beverage relaxing playing Temper pedic commercial, when the mattress said hey you know what would be fun? Throw the glass in the air! When the full aspects of two chambers combined, in a violent (only because I silly thought I could keep a glass resting while I did not move on it) but yet scary motion, said hey 2 becomes one giant bubble! Awesome... oh wait. -1"
1,A waste of Money,"I bought an Intex Pillow Rest Mid-Rise Air Mattress and Pump on 4/25/11 and as of a week ago I need to pump it up 2-3 time a day. They have a lovely 30 day replacement warranty so you know where that leaves me. Prior to this mattress I had a AeroBed that lasted 3 yrs and I paid about the same price, so I guess I will be going back to AeroBed."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,THis BED IS HORRIBLE. AFTER HAVING IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH EVERY SEAM ON IT BURST AND WE WERE LEFT WITH A 50 DOLLAR BALLOON! THE PEOPLE AT INTEX WERE EXTREMELY RUDE BUT LUCKILY AMAZON HAS MORE TACT AND GAVE ME A FULL REFUND. INTEX BEDDING PRODUCTS ARE POORLY MADE. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND BED THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS WITH.ORIGINAL MESSAGE:I have had several aerobeds in the past and I must say the quality of this bed surpasses that of the Aerobed brand. Also my fiance is 300+ pounds and I weight 250. We both have been sleeping comfortably and I have not had to fill it up with air again since I filled it. The built in pillow rest has added comfort to my already comfortable Serta side sleeper pillow. My fiance and I are using this as our regular bed for daily use and we both sleep like big babies!
1,Deflated...junk,"This bed went flat within 2 nights. I wasnt jumping on it or anything crazy and Im not a big cow putting too much weight on it so I guess its just cheaply made. I reinflated it, and it went flat again within a day without me even laying on it. Its crap if you ask me"
5,Fantastico,"Ordene 2 de estos Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump y son fantasticos. Los use por 9 noches y fue como dormir en una cama regular. Mi esposa, mi hijo de 9 años y yo dormimos muy comodos en él.La bomba de aire integrada funciona excelentemente, tanto para llenarlo como para vaciarlo. En cuestion de minutos esta inflado y listo para usarlo. Las sabanas tamaño Queen le caen muy bien. He mantendo uno de ellos inflado por las ultimas 3 semanas y no se ha desinflado ni perdido rigidez.La altura y el tamaño del colchon son magnificos.En resumen es muy buena compra por su precio."
2,Was great until ...,an inside layer broke and made the airbed useless. Happend on the 4th time I used it. Better don't blow it up too much
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this airbed for my 12 year old son. At first we were very happy with it- the built in pump is awesome and the bed took only minutes to inflate. Over time(a few months)the seams began to leak air, we have patched 2 spots, but within a day another leak has sprung. I'm not sure what i expected for under $60.00. ALso you should be aware that there is no warranty available. Very disappointed in the bed and myself for buying cheap."
4,"""Bed-Like Comfort"" - Just like the description says!","For the money, this is not a bad bed. It is pretty ""bed like"", pretty soft. It does lose a bit of air overnight though."
1,Deflated and can't return it!,I purchased this bed in Jan. The return window ended in Feb. I only slept on this bed once and it started leaking in April. Piece of c.r.a.p!
1,NEVER HELD AIR - Intex said TOO BAD we don't offer any replcement or refund.,"from the first day we put air in it it leaked. Intex told me to use a spray bottle with soap in it to find the leak. I tried that, but you it is impossibe to get between the two mattresses. DO NOT BUT - YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE THE MONEY OUT TO THE BON FIRE."
3,Very Comfortable But Cold and Loses Air,"This is a very comfortable air bed, no doubt about it. I use it about once a month while visiting my mother and lay it out on the floor in the den. Air beds are cold, even in summer. I have to put an electric blanket under the sheets.I have the same issue with it as other reviewers have found. After about 4 uses it started losing air from the intake/output valve. I wake up 3 or 4 times during the night, reach over the edge to push the air pump button to get it back up. It's annoying. It's a nicely made mattress, certainly more comfortable than a sofa bed, but you'd think they would find a solution to the air loss problem. I've been dealing with this for 2 years now and am in the market for a new one because I'd like to get a full night's sleep."
4,"good, could be better","Over all I am happy with my purchase it inflates and deflates quickly although I did notice a few flaws. It does lose some air during the night and also tends to be cold to sleep on with just a sheet on the bottom if it is cold outside. Will try a blanket under the sheet this weekend if it is cold out. A little combersome due to weight and size, was also a challenge to get it back in the bag. Overall it's a great addition to our race trailor."
1,"You get what you pay for - lasted three months to partial failure, mostly failed within four.","We were pretty excited when we received the Intex Pillow RestQueen. It's high, off the ground, reasonably comfortable, and fits all of the queen sized sheets we had. We got a couple of good months of sleep on it. Guests will love it. Unfortunately, on month four, 93 days after receiving the Bed, one of the ""seams"" that holds down the mattress inflatable components ""popped up"" - and so there was a 2-3"" high bubble. That was okay for a while, as it was on the edge, and you could crawl over it, but on month five, about 120 days after receiving the Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed - a second seam popped up in the middle - resulting in an almost impossible to sleep on surface.So - great price - I think I paid $40 for mine, but only count on it to last four months."
1,did not stay pumped up,"we bought this mattress to sleep on for my husband and myself while on vacation. It was very comfy at first, but after several hours it deflated somewhat and was uncomfortable. we put more air in it for the second night. And it did it again. I'm dissapointed because we didn't use it until two months are we bought it and now it's too late to return it. I'll call the manufacturer for the warranty. I wonder if they are all like this, or if ours has a leak somewhere.I went out and bought a Coleman mattress with a PVC pump. I hope we have better success with this one!"
2,Comfortable...when it has air,"I bought 2 of these beds. One is ok, the other loses air to the point that it must be re-filled several times a day if being used. There are no holes in the bed so we believe the valve is faulty. I guess these are hit or miss."
4,Envy of the other campers,"I would have given the product 5 stars, but it didn't stay fully inflated all night long (but I did have to get up a lot with a little one so that might have had something to do with it). It is VERY large, I'm not sure how we are going to get the mattress back into the box without a magic wand. Other then those two things, we were very impressed with it and how tall off the ground we were. Had the wind not been so loud, it would have felt like sleeping at home or a hotel."
1,worked well for a month,"Worked well for a month, then heard a popping sound when I sat on it. I am not a very big person, so I don't think the weight was an issue. Now it is uneven and uncomfortable. Amazon will not take it back even thought it is defective because it is outside the return window."
5,This bed is a great,I had to replace my other air bed that I had gotten from Walmart. I spent triple the amount on a smaller bed and it was horrible. This one is perfect. I don't wake up with back pain. It is higher off the ground so i feel like I am in a real bed.. I love this air bed
3,It's ok,"does not hold air good for the first night but after that seems ok, comfortable, cheaper than buying at the store"
3,Intex queen airbed with pillow,"I bought the Intex airbed for camping and decided to test it out at home to make sure it holds air before the trip. I was disappointed to find it didn't! I thought I did my research and picked one that had good reviews. Luckily it is 18 1/2"" high so we didn't actually end up on the ground by morning! It was comfortable although it lost air. We realized that you can fill it up though while still laying on it so that made it a little easier in the middle of the night when we had to fill it up again. I feel it takes a little longer to inflate and deflate than it said on the reviews as well. It did come with a nice carrying bag and amazingly you can fold it back up to fit back into the bag. The kids now enjoy laying on it to watch movies."
1,They don't last,I purchased four (4) of these air mattresses to use while my family waited for our furniture to be shipped cross country. Two of the four mattresses lost their internal chambers and one side of the mattress blew up like a balloon. Rendering each air mattress unusable. These mattresses will not last short or long term.
2,Probably good for part time use,"I bought this item as a cheap fix after I moved, and slept on it every night for about a month and a half. It was comfortable, and convenient, but the chambers burst, and now it's not even use-able. I'd recommend it for camping, or as a guest bed, but if you're looking for a permanent bed, I wouldn't buy this one."
2,Deflating problem,"I had ordered this item based on a friends raving review. They had claimed it was the most comfortable air mattress they've ever used, and by all means, they're not exaggerating. The first time I used my mattress, it was excellent. It was firm, yet comfortable, and it held its air the entire night. However, on the second use, the top compartment (it has two), deflated within about 15 minutes of inflating the mattress...without anyone even lying on it! I took this as the product having some fault, so I returned it to amazon and had a replacement sent. Mattress #2 acted the EXACT same way. First sleep was a comfortable success. Second sleep...well there was no second sleep because it partially deflated before it could be used. Unfortunately, considering an air mattress is not an item that is used all that often, my return policy has run out, so I'm stuck with an unusable product. Very disappointing."
1,Don't buy if you want something long term,"I had this air mattress for less than 6 months, with only light use when guests come over to the apartment. I probably did not use this mattress more than 15 times and now it becoming undone at one of the seams and leaking air bad. I know people who have had better experiences with better quality mattresses, so next time, cost will not be the overriding factor."
2,No wonder the other ones are so much more expensive,"At first this airbed seemed great. It was comfortable for about a month but then the baffles on one side came undone and it's too lopsided to use. It might make a college room sofa since one side is SO much higher than the other, but since it's a guest room bed and can't be slept in, it's going in the garbage. It doesn't appear that Intex or Amazon stand behind this product after 30 days of use."
4,Good air mattress for the money.,This is a good product for the money. Easy to inflate and deflate. Comfortable too and the pillows keep the head a little higher than the rest of the bed.
4,Great Air Bed,This is the third Intex air bed that we have purchased. We are using them in our new beach house until the checkbook cools. We like the beds so much that we have decided that we can wait awhile before replacing them with mattress/boxspring sets. Easy to set-up and easy to take down with the blow-up/take down air pump built right in. An excellent buy for the money!
4,Does the Job,"We've only used this once so far, as it's meant to be a spare bed for when we have too many guests stay over. It worked great and stayed inflated all night. No complaints here."
4,"So far, so good","We've had this airbed for 2 months, it's only used for when we have more guests than beds. We've only used it once and it worked as expected, the bed is comfortable, holds it air, and expands to a good heights (you are nowhere near the floor as with some airbeds), it's also a good sized queen. My only complaints are that it takes a while to blow up but you don't have to actively pump it up so it isn't that bad and also folding back into it's bag is not fun - ours seems to have outgrown it's bag!"
4,good bed for the price,Have only used this bed a couple of times. Easy to inflate and deflate. Cord an pump are all internal to the bed. Perfect for extra occasional bed. Good price.
2,"Very comfortable. WARNING: use occasionally, doesn't last","We may have over-used this bed, but I ordered it only 5 months ago. It has 3 months constant use and now has a leak For occasional use I recommend it for comfort and ease."
1,You'd better hope it lasts...,"Ths air bed while impressive at first, quickly looses its ability to retain air. The company is no help at all with this, you can't even submit their email response form. I guess if you were able to it old only matter if it was bought in the past 30 days. Gamble your money if you please, I'll never be buying another one of these."
3,Nice but smelly,This air mattress is comfortable but it is sooo smelly from the plastic or the flocked top it has. It was blown up for two days before sleeping on it and was still almost unbearable. I had trouble sleeping and woke up with a horrible head ache. My five year old even complained about the smell. It has been a few days later and it still smells. I like the mattress itself but will be returning it due to the smell which Im sure is a chemical the is definatly not good for anyone to be breathing in all night long.
2,"Good in the begining, died in 3 months","I was pretty happy with this airbed in the beginning. It was very comfortable, fast to inflate. But with time I noticed that material of the bad gets stretchy. Mostly on the sides. After that I decided to return it (and Amazon kindly accepted it coz I didn't have any guaranty from the manufacturer in the box). But I decided to keep it since I didn't have time to ship it back. And few days ago when I came from work I found that the bed got the big hole underneath. Seems like the reinforcing rig just pulled the surface material so strong so the material broke. And now I have to sleep on the floor :-)"
1,intex does not stand by there product,I bought this queen airbed less then six month ago and has developed a leak in the motor assembly. Contacted intex said they have no warranties on product and when talking I asked why they do not stand by there product with a no answer response. Never again would I buy from them
4,Airbed review,"Bought this airbed and it was just as advertised. Looked at several vendors - large range of prices for the same product. It is heavier than the previous model I had, but it is also twice as tall - we like that. Had a power outage and ended up buying a spare battery pump so it works under all circumstances. Comparably speaking, I think it is a good buy."
2,a rubber tube of air,"Feels like sleeping on a rubber tube of air. Would not recommend if you have weak knees, weigh over 300 lbs, or suffer from sea sickness.Mattress was punctured by a porcupine while in my tent."
1,not happy,dear siri was not happy because i didn'tknow that u.s.a voltage was a lot different than australia i think you should mention it when some one over seas is buying a productcheers john
1,Not a happy camper,"This bed blew out on the second day. One person weighing 125lbs was sleeping on it in a travel trailer (no rocks, sticks etc..). I was not happy and returned it and got my money back."
4,Great Airbed,I used it when my family comes over and the girls sleep on it! They love it and its very comfortable.
1,Don't buy it!!,"There are two positives about this airbed, it is high off of the floor and it has a built in pump. You need the built in pump because the bed loses air and you need to add air to the bed at least once per night. I have been sleeping on this airbed for 2 weeks; I have a neck ache and a back ache. My short sofa sleeps better than this bed...I guess you get what you pay for. I thought the price was too good to be true and it is! Next time I'm going to pay closer attention to the reviews before I purchase another airbed!!! Don't buy this one!!!!!"
4,Happy Camper,We were well pleased with our Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed. It did have a tendency to loose a little air but the overall review is our house guest rested quite comfortably. We would recommend this porduct.
4,Inex Air Bed,This Air Bed is a great buy for the price. Comfortable & sturdy too. It wont deflate when you leave it on standby (2 wks) while on vacation.
3,Bubbled Bed,"Well, unfortunately within a week after starting to use this bed, we heard loud popping noises and were awakened by the bed mutating on one top side and enlarging unevenly along the top seams. Kind of like it was changing into almost a sofa. Needless to say this was quite startling in the middle of the night. It was such a good deal though with Prime shipping discounts that it is probably not worth returning. Could just be this one was defective though but thought I would convey our experience. Perhaps we had too much weight on it with close to 400 lbs. so maybe we were amiss ourselves therefore I gave it a ""3"" rating.Thanks!"
1,Defective,Got it out of the box inflated it and..... it leaks air through the air intake/outlet when its closed. If your looking for an airbed spend a few more bucks and get something else.
2,Disappointed,"This could have been a great product. I ordered two and unfortunately was disappointed to find out that both products lose air very quickly-does not even stay inflated overnight. I don't know if there was a malfunction with the products themselves or if they had some kind of damage from the warehouse. Only got to use each one once. If they would have stayed inflated, this product would have been a great one. Inflated, it is very comfortable and so easy to inflate with the built-in pump. Too bad-very disappointed."
2,"Leaky, Leaky, Leaky","I purchased this mattress in August 2009 and again in June 2010. Shame on me. Loved it the first time and used it regularly until it developed a leak, which I had hoped was a fluke. The second one developed a leak after just two uses.The mattress was very comfortable and functional, and everyone who slept on it raved about its comfort for an air mattress.I wish it was more durable, but I really can't recommend it unless you are willing to pay about $25 a night for the privilege of resting on it!"
2,Airbed falls flat,"I purchased the Intex Pillow Rest Queen Air Bed late November 2009. It was used 4 times, always on carpet. When I used it in June, 2010, for the 4th time, it went flat in about 15 minutes. When I contacted the company they refused any help and said ""go through the store"", which, in this case, was Amazon. The bed was comfortable and easy to use -- but it should definately last for more than 4 uses! Also, Intex should be a little more concerned about standing by their product."
2,Disposable airbed,That bed came with a hold. We had to use the patch from the first night. The quality is disposable.
4,Nice air mattress,"What can I say about an airmattress other than what most people know. They aren't the most comfortable but it beats sleeping on the floor. I don't know what catagorizes anything as a ""Pillow top,"" because this mattress did not have any ""Pillow"" on it. It just had a fake suede feeling top. My wife and I were able to comfortably sleep on it with minimal deflation over night. I have had some cheap air mattresses that have required me to wake up in the middle of the night to reinflate it because most of the air was lost.Overall, it is the best airmattress I have ever slept on, but I just hate them all in general.Pros: No more batteries needed. It plugs into the wall. It got the job done, and was able to comfortably fit my wife and I.Cons: Still lost some air over night. Not the most ergonimcally supportive air mattress.Overall: You get what you pay for."
4,sr,"i bought bed 6 month ago,most of the time i sleep alone ,and i t is very good until now,i use and sponge blanket before the regular blanket to feel better to my back,it lose little air so twice a month i turn on the pump for half a minute,that is all.i recomend for the price ,i dont know if two people sleep daily,but as i state it is a very good air bed."
3,Not bad!,Only gave this bed a 3 star eating because I knew eventually it would malfunction because of everyday use. But after 3 weeks the seal popped and my bed has a new headrest. It's still comfy just no company.
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this product mainly motivated by the price of the product. As I should have expected, previous reviews were correct in that this mattress does not last at all. I looked for a leak and while the plastic was fine it was actually the motor which was letting air out in the night. This perfectly encompasses the inferior quality of the mattress as its not even tearing plastic that's typically an expected issue but a fault in design from the very foundations of the product. I don't really have another product to suggest, just don't buy this."
1,first nite losing air,"already losing air after sleeping on it 2 hrs. inflated it again, will try i more nite. think i will return. will update review."
1,Leaks. Didn't make it through the 1st night,"I purchased this item on June 11, 2012 for my 14 year old daughter and her friend to sleep on during our week long family vacation. As soon as it arrived, I inflated it and it seemed perfect. I was so impressed with the ease of inflation that I showed a few friends how nice it was and inflated it again. It seemed perfect. Went on vacation the 1st week of August and the 1st night it was slept on it did not make it through the night. The poor girls woke up on the floor every morning. When I got home I checked my return options and found out that my return window expired on July 20, 2012. My husband checked the air mattress and found that it is leaking around the built in pump. It is a piece of junk. Will never buy an air mattress with a built in pump again."
2,Defective,"Yesterday I possibly would have rated this item a five, but after having it for only a month, today one of the chamber seals broke. So now the right side is significantly higher then the other it looks and feels really awkward. There is also the small issue of it losing air a bit faster then I anticipated. Otherwise, the product was great. It is super comfortable, especially with a mattress topper.Hope that helps!"
5,Very good product,"I bought this product because I received guests for more than two weeks and I needed a good air bed. No complaints! Very good bed, easy to inflate etc.. I recommend it."
2,Not for everyday use,"I purchased this in January 2010 to use as an everyday replacement for my old bed. For the first three months, it worked great. Very comfortable, quick inflation/Deflation. After that, a coil burst on the upper and lower mattress parts and a queen became two twins. It's not unusable.I bought it because it was a great price for a queen with free shipping on Amazon prime. That was a mistake. I should have spent a little more to get a better quality mattress.If you need a mattress for visiting family/friends, this may work. For everything else, buy something else."
4,Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed,My guests were very pleased & comfortable. It was nicer than the Areobed I had purchased a couple of years ago.
1,expectations not met at all,i bought this product to use while my house hold goods were being shipped over seas. it wasnt even 3 weeks before the vinyl seal spit and it started leaking air. and the patch provided was for punctures and didnt work at all for this defect. we are average weighted people and the seal didnt last for even the time we NEEDED it to. we are not happy to sleep on the floor till our shipment arrives.
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. MY DAD BOUGHT IT FOR ME AS A REPLACEMENT BED, AND I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AND THE BLOODY THING GOT A HUGE AIR BUBBLE IN IT. I COULD STILL SLEEP IN IT BUT LAST NIGHT IT POPPED AGAIN AND NOW ITS UNUSABLE."
1,Inferior Product,"I received this item on June 27th. It has already sprung a leak. I called the manufacturer, and this item has no warranty nor service attached to it. They will only advise how to patch the leak. Such an inferior product with no life span is creating more ""stuff"" to throw into our land-fills! This is a lose-lose product! I do not recommend!"
1,Worked well at first but soon failed...,"DO NOT BUY! This air bed inflates nicely and is initially comfortable, but the internal seams soon give way and the thing puffs up like a big balloon and is unusable. And THERE IS NO INTEX WARRANTY. Intex does not warranty their airbeds, so their is no recourse. Very disappointing."
1,worst airbed ever!,I bought this airbed less than four months ago and the stitching popped and the bed now looks like a balloon. Never order anything like this from this website.
1,Boken after a few use,"It's already broken after just a few nights use. I also noticed quite a few recent negative review about this product. It is not an coincident. Don't buy it.We also called the ""customer services"" who said NO WARRANTY. Hope my review can save you from wasting money !!"
1,Horrible - Intex Pillow Rest Queen,"I first purchased this airbed in February and have had 4 replacements so far, the first one just started swelling within the first month and the following two developed holes within the first month and the last one swelled so this is it for me, refund. Also, it is not high enough so it's difficult getting out of bed especially for someone that's about 5'7"". It's like doing a squat - I do appreciate exercise :) but that's a choice not a requirement."
1,Needs constant re-inflation,"Sorely regretting purchasing this air mattress. Reviews looked so favorable, but the first night of use, it required multiple re-inflations throughout the night (and the one person sleeping on it was only about 115 pounds!). Tried a second night and again it could only go a few hours without deflating. My guest had to sleep on the couch for the rest of her stay. I can't find a hole anywhere, and now it's too late for me to return it and get my money back."
1,Intex worst customer service.....I called the BBB...,"I purchased 5 beds at different times over 5 months...the queen size 16"" in height kept breaking...the chamber on one end kept expanding and made the bed impossible to sleep on..I had to return it to the store where i purchased it over and over..5 defective beds..I called intex up about this issue and they told me there was nothing they could do and no returns..Rude and not helpful."
1,"Crap, Super Crapola","3 weeks old and the seam @ the pillow has ""blown"" so now there is a GINORMOUS hump @ the top of this infernal thing.dont waste your time or money on this piece of junk!"
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!,"I have bought two air beds made by this company. BOTH have failed me miserably! The air stays very cold, so you are cold all night long. Inevitably, in either a few weeks or a few months, your comfortable investment deflates. This time, I wound up inches from the floor, cold and struggling to get up out of the deflated mess, not to mention the state of my aching back. Save your money. I am still shopping around for an air bed that will live up to its claims."
1,I would not recommend this,"This air mattress does not hold air well at all. Every time I have used it, it looses at least 50% of the air by morning. I have bought and own other Intex air mattresses and have been very happy with them. This particular air mattress is very unsatisfactory and I would not recommend it."
5,Amazing,"Amazing can sum this up with one word, but I cant to that. We bought this air mattress a couple of weeks ago for our camping trip, inflated it and when we went to bed that night, it was like sleeping on an actual mattress bed. I would totally recommend this mattress to anyone. Simply AMAZING."
1,waste of money,"i agreed with previous review from ericamericaafter few weeks usage, my airbed popping up like this and its unusable [...]waste of money !! and there is no warranty covered"
5,Excellent,"This bed is just the ticket. Easy to inflate, excellent to sleep on, stores well. I have loaned it to my friends and they think it does a fine job as well."
2,Worked great twice,"We used this air mattress twice and it worked great. It was very comfortable and a nice height off the ground. Since we only use it when company comes, it was at least 3-4 months before we used it again. The third time it wouldn't hold air. There are no holes in it anywhere and I cannot figure out where the air is leaking from. Of course now it's too late to return it. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Leaked on the first night.,"We got this air mattress to be an extra bed when we had guests. Unfortunately the first time we had a chance to use it 1-2 months after we bought it, it deflated to the point of feeling your bottom on the ground half way through the night. Given the return policy of amazon we had to try to repair it. I am hoping with the repair it at least makes it through the night."
1,no good,"I bought this airbed to use as a mattress until I have the money saved for a new one. after a few weeks, 2 of the panels popped up & now only half the bed is really usable. I'm only 120lbs so it couldn't be a weight issue. total waste of money, should've payed more & got an aerobed."
1,Horrible,"The mattress was fine on the first two night, but the by the 3rd night the seems on the mattress has come out, so one side of the mattress is higher then the other. The mattress started leaking air as well, so keep having to fill it back up over and over. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Intex Pillow rest Queen Air bedwith electric pump,"Length:: 0:52 MinsAfter using the air bed for about 1 1/2 months it started to loose air somewhere. A review I had seen before I bought the air bed said that they had the air valve leaking. I checked the vale but there was another problem. I then checked the whole pump housing and found that the whole seam between the pump and the vinyl of the bed was leaking. As the manufacture only warrants the bed for 30 days if purchased directly from them, I'll have to check what warranty might be available from Amazon.While I believe I can fix the leaks why should I have to when the bed is only 1 1/2 months old?I do not recommend this brand of air bed.When you see the video notice the soap bubbles as the air bed starts to fill."
1,Would have been an awesome product except...,"At first I thought this matress was really awesome. We were using this because the movers had just picked up all our stuff to ship it. Not even a month of using it, it was already leaking. It did not come with a patch kit so I patched it with kit that came with my other air matress. However after a couple of days another cut appeared in the same area. This time it was leaking more. I patched it again but tonight, it's leaking again from somewhere and I'm still trying to find it. This matress is not for long term use. I am warning you, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!"
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,I bought this as a guest bed - it didn't even make it 5 days without leaking. It only had one 120lb women sleeping on it! I do not recommend this product.
1,Avoid Intex!!!!!,I got an Intex Airbed a few months ago and the air intake valve stem was faulty. That basically meant no air bed for me. Th ey will replace it if YOU spend the money to have it sent back. Needless to say I wrote this brand of Airbed off and will be informing everyone I can not to make the mistake I made... ordering from a slipshod company!
2,Not good at holding air,We bought this mattress to take with us to Oklahoma to stay at my hubby's parents house (we just got home a few days ago). The first night was fine but by the second night the air began to leak out. I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I was in a hole because of how much air leaked out. We started deflating it every morning because of space issues and even re-inflating it every night didn't help the situation because we still lost air halfway through the night. Not sure if mine is defective or if all of them do this but I didn't like it!!
5,air mattress,"This air mattress was a great value! It's well made, easy to use (built in pump), and comfortable to sleep on...What more could you ask for?!"
2,Its OK,"I bought this, was looking for a good deal on an air mattress. The first night or two, it was perfect, but a leak must have developed because now, it inflates and is deflated by the middle of the night. Problem is, I don't know where to look to find the leak. It could be anywhere and I may or may not see it. Haven't spent much time looking for it and I just packed it away for now, but hopefully the next time I use it, I can patch it up.I didn't expect it to be amazing and I got what I paid for, but wish it would have lasted a little longer."
2,Did not last long,"Bed was great for 2 weeks, but then the bed came apart. The seams started to detach and a big air bubble formed. Baically unusable now."
2,I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH SERTA,"I bought this mattress as I move quite often as a student and so wanted something mobile, and yet comfortable so I researched and came up with this product. I must admit I really liked it in comparison to air mattresses I've had in the past, except for one thing.... ""IT RIPPED AT THE THE SEAMS""... I am 200 pounds, and due to a back issue don't jump or throw myself on my bed and couldn't understand why one night the ribbed seams on the lying surface just popped and I found myself sleeping on a mound, so now I find myself three months after purchase looking for another bed, as I cannot return this one, despite it being defective, I should have just bought a normal spring mattress from Serta... sigh"
1,no air bed,We bought this to take with us on vacation and ended up with half the bed losing air by the middle of the nite.We tryed for 5 nites and all 5 nites I ended on the floor in the middle of the nite upset.
4,Very good for the money,"When I was starting out in NYC just out of school, I slept on an air mattress for about 8 months. Fast forward 8 years, and I needed a mattress for a weeks while I was waiting for my bed. For only paying about $40, this air mattress is great. Very easy electrical pump, and it even has a little nook to contain the chord when not in use. I did notice it would lose a bit of air during the night, but again, at this price it's a great mattress."
2,looks nice night good buy,after a few weeks of use to of the seams popped out and made 2 huge lumps on 1 side of the bed and 2 seams over toward the middle split at the ends now it's slowly leaks air until we wake up on the floor in the morning
4,Queen Airbed,"I loved this air mattress the first few times my dh and I slept on it. It was very comfortable. I actually woke up with no back pain. But it was short lived. After a few times of sleeping on it, it develop a few air bubbles which eventually came into one large air bubble. This happen less than a month of having it. Money wasted. I would consider buying a new one but I don't know how to avoid the air bubble therefore I would not want to waste more money on a product that will not last. Sad!"
4,Queen Air,For what i bought this air bed for it works great.I only bought it for extra bed space when all my family are here from out of townI did put it up & slept on it one night just to see how comfortable it was or wasnt as for now im very happy with it &Im considerind building a platform to set it on & putting it up permenantly for me to sleep on
5,I *LOVE* My Mei Hip!,"We started out with a Baby Bjorn after my son was born that a relative gave us. It was fine for the first few months but, once he hit 17 lbs the shoulder pain was just out of control. We did a bunch of research online and found lots of positive reviews for the Ellaroo Mei Hip. I ordered it and have truly never looked back. It is so incredibly comfortable, even now when he is far heavier. (He is nearly a year old now.) All of the weight is down on my hip and I regularly walk the 3 mile path around the lake by my house with him on my hip with very little effort and no pain. It also packs so small & light that it is really easy to keep in the diaper bag and pull out whenever we get somewhere in the car. A great product!"
1,Completely useless !,"Waste of money, that kind of DVD I could make myself,and I am only amateur musician. The guy even stated that's not going to show you anything.I returned it!"
1,Very disappointed with this DVD.,"I bought Boogie Woogie Piano by Mitch Woodsbecause there is very little about this style on the marketbut I didn't know Mitch Woods at all. I wasn't lucky.Hoping for some good tips and examples, I got beginner level of samples that kids even would be bored with.BTW Played not very precisely as somebody would expected.Also not a one even complete song was presented.You won't learn anything from that DVD unless you are in kinder garden.If you want to learn something buy great Dr. John instead."
1,This video is a waste of time,"With all due respect Mitch is a quality player but this video does not showcase that in the least. In fact, the video is a complete waste of time. 99% of the information on here is for complete beginners. There is very little insight in to what makes this style. Most of the information is common knowledge for anybody that's even remotely attempted to play blues. I didn't need a 10 minute conversation in the middle of (60 minutes video) on how a blues progression works. I would imagine if someone is attempting to play boogie woogie they already know how 12 bars blues is constructed.Here is the worst part for me. I bought this video off of Mitch's site for $35 (with shipping and handling). It's about $20 cheaper on Amazon. I was ripped off. I'm hoping I can prevent others from the same. Skip this video."
2,"chatty, disappointing","For heart and soul learning to play boogie woogie this DVD has too much commentary that isn't helpful in this directiion. Mr. Woods comes across with an air of quiet, self satisfied arrogance that is off putting - plus a reluctance to his revealing his boogie woogie expertise. A student wants to feel the teacher is enthusiastic about his learning the subject. That feeling isn't here.To be fair, Woods does carefully demonstrate a number of left and right hand patterns. And there is a booklet of sheet music enclosed. However, from this reviewer's experience, some of the how-to-teach-yourself blues/boogie woogie books WITH A CD are a better value and more fruitful for the learner."
1,A disappointment,"I had high hopes for this DVD, being both a fan of Mr. Woods' CDs and an intermediate-advanced pianist.Unfortunately, this DVD is very basic and introductory- it's for beginners only.Mr. Woods doesn't share any of his signature right-hand licks, and so, anyone with even a basic knowledge of boogie-woogie is unlikely to learn anything new.Not recommended."
1,"Oh, Lawd have mercy!","Mariah has completely lost it! What happened to her signature pop gems? This Rap nonsense she's gotten into since '96 or so has comletely drowned out her voice! It seems like she's just re-hashing past songs with generic titles like Honey, Heartbreaker, Dreamlover, and what-not. Mariah's Vision Of Love is over 'cuz she just whines her way through this song and is Dream-luvin' her career down a dirty toilet! Man, this stinks!Someone get an air-freshener, quick!!"
1,"OK, what's up with all the different car colors!?!?!?","Blue. purple. NOW RED!?!??!?! This song is the worst pop song ever and I love pop so much I can't describe! Through the use of computers she sings two totally different things at once...ONE-I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, need a, need a, need a, need a, lover, lover, lover, lover WOOOOO!!!!AT THE SAME TIME-He's all mine and I think he's oh so fine, all I need is him to be my loverboy!!!Sucks."
1,Tired,"What a waste of time. Mariah Carey needs to look inside and find something-anything at all. This has got to be the worst song of the year. It is a crime. Not only only does this song cement Mariah's unreal ability to release the same song over and over again, it pushes her farther and farther away from any respectablity. The song is tired and weak. Mariah ""sings"" in that sing songy tramp voice she seems to love so much. The music is nothing new(or even good), and Da Brat doesn't do it for Ms. Carey. Unfortunely as time progresses Mariah's talent decreases. What once was a truimphant talent is now a nothing but a waste of air space."
1,The biggest sell-out joke in history,"I heard this song recently and my God I felt so insulted by this tripe of a song. It's so sad that the her hip-hop-rap direction has been dragging her down ever since the Butterfly album which was amixed bag for me. But God this song is so idiotic. It sounds like some juvenile noise that some 8 year old could easily surpass in artistic quality. Mariah sold out big time. I can't believe that this tasteless, embarrassing garbage song came from the same woman who did Dream Lover, Hero, Someday, and Vision Of Love. It's really sad that her hip-hop direction has ruined her sound completely because she has a great voice and deserves to sing real music. She might be proud of such mature, sappy songs like Vision of Love, Love Takes Time, Can't Let Go, and Dream Lover but will she be proud of such juvenile, childish songs like Sweetheart, and Heartbreaker?"
1,What was she thinking?,"I'm a fan and was eagerly awaiting Mariah's new project. Unfortunately, the first single ""Loverboy"" is hands-down the worst song I have heard in ages. There seems to be no melody, just an assortment of noises all vying for attention, to the point that it is unlistenable. Hopefully, this is not representative of the remainder of the soundtrack."
1,"FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, WHAT IS THIS ???!!!","Never knew Mariah Carey, for sure. It's not my kind of music. All I knew about her was that she was another female singer with a great voice singing pop tunes, in the same vein as Celine Dion, Houston, etc, etc. One day before, I was changing the channels and by chance I stopped on MTV. It was showing the clip of the song LOVERBOY, by Mariah Carey. I could believe what I was hearing. I thin maybe it is the worst ""pop"" music I ever heard in my entire life. Everything bad taste. And, as for Mariah, she doesn't even sing, she just screams and wails and put short clothes. There's not even a coeherent line in the entire ""lyrics""...!!! What is this? Who wrote this garbage ??!! Can someone please guarantee me that her other albuns are a little better than this thing???!!"
2,what a stinker,its not that i hate mariah- been a fan since music box and loved her past albums...but since heartbreaker she's sort of gone downhill...i dun know how this is any listenable to you people- i tink she should just do mush ballads and scratch any faster than that from now on. pity- cos i really liked herdreamlover/fantasy (were faster songs)
1,What is this?!,"This song is bad with a capitol ""B"". It has a bass line that cuts in and out for no apparent reason. Plus you can barely hear Mariah's voice. I just hear cooing and moaning. I think it's safe to say Mariah's career has dribbled to a end..."
2,why?,"i am a very big fan of mariah since 1990, after hearing her first hit, vision of love, i always admire the way she sings, as if she doesn't give any effort. bought her cd's and singles. and grow up with her music and witnessed her music evolved and grow from soultry ballads to hip-hop, r&b grooves. i love her but i most admit that this single is way too far. and i don't like it, in my own opinion. it seems that, it's not her and the song doesn't really fit her. her voice really did change too. like it's coming from her nose or back of his nostrils. like some blonde teenage singers that are having hit albums one time to another. even the video is not really that good. i'm really sad that i had to rate her 2 stars out of 5. i hope mariah could still do something unique and timeless in the near future like the way she did into her 2 albums naming butterfly and daydream."
3,FIRST SINGLE FROM HER UPCOMING MOVIE,"Now this single incudes the original version featuring Cameo and a remix featuring Da Brat, Ludacris, Twenty II, and Shawnna. I like the original version better especially the ""Candy"" sample. This is the first single from her movie Glitter and her first single with Virgin."
1,A SHAME TO POP MUSIC,"This song is a disgrace, even for today MTV-orientated low standards. Never imagined Mariah could ""sing"" (a thing she does not here !!!) so bad, never imagined a song could be so boring and embarrasingly bad, bad, bad. This is her lowest point in her career. What shocke most, beyond the low quality of the tune, is the clear lack of any emotion or belief in what she was doing. THis song is an example of how far bad music can go."
4,A Taste Of The 80's,"From what I understand, Mariah wanted this song to sound fresh from the 1980's, and she succeeded in doing that. I would say that ""Loverboy"" is one of the best dance tracks I've heard from Mariah in a while, but the only problem is, while it is great and all, it isn't too original. In my point of view this song sort of sounds like ""Honey"" without all the hip-hop elements. But aside from all of that, this song features Mariah's shining vocals as always hitting those high notes near the end. Pick this single up today, and don't listen to what the critics have to say, because they are so wrong."
1,Forget it...,"I'm shocked, I'm stunned... I just listened to this thing called ""Loverboy"", by Mariah... Then I watched the clip... Then I saw some people reviewed this five stars.... That was too much for me. Mariah, you beat me. If you release garbage like this and keeps on selling millions, then you must be a real ""musical"" genius and I am the one who is dumb..."
1,Mariah's gone off the deep end,"This single is proof of how far Mariah has fallen: Sampling, using rappers, oohing and ahhing with unintelligible lyrics to boot. And throw in a video that is a disgrace to someone who is capable of so much more."
1,Very bad music from Mariah,"I only give this song 1 star because it is a poor song. Mariah used to be so good. Her music gets worse and worse with each new release. You can't even understand what she is saying and it's so overproduced. The remix isn't much better either. [....] Ah well, it'll make a good coaster. Don't waste your money unless you're looking for a cheap set of coasters."
2,"Not All That, Lovergal","It is hard to believe it, when an artist does try to make themselves into another kind of sound, it doesn't really have a feeling all the way anyway. That was the case with Mariah Carey. She began to stretch herself out with a Hip Hop style in the late 90's, and experimented her way to the top. Unfortunately, it wasn't in this song. Loverboy, the first of only two singles from her movie, Glitter, really isn't as strong or as upbeat as any of her earlier songs, when she was a down to Earth diva. The song also includes Cameo as a guest appearance, which really wasn't the right mix from the Funk band of their day. Anyway, Mariah did improve with Through The Rain, but not here."
2,No Credit to The Cars?,"It is suprising that no credit for the cover concept is given to The Cars album ""Candy-o""."
2,What The Hell???,"I've liked Mariah Carey since 1995 when she came out with Fantasy and those hits. So when I heard that Glitter will be based on music of the 1980's, I was real excited since I love 80's beats and Mariah's voice, but Loverboy was a disappointment. Cameo's Candy(the sample in the song) is a great song, but it didn't go well with Loverboy's melody. Instead it sounded like a musical mush of Dreamlover, Fantasy, Honey and Heartbreaker thrown over a beat. Mariah, I love you, but this is not your best work. I'm still looking forward to seeing Glitter the movie, but I doubt that I'll be updating my Mariah CD collection this year. Hopefully hearing the other music will change my mind."
1,Sample queen reigns supreme!,"More PopSoul from the diva of PopSoul. Another ""hit"" single featuring yet another sample from a proven hit. Well I guess if you can't make good music, sample it from someone who can. This time the victim is ""Candy"" by Cameo. ""Candy"" is a true classic and Mariah jumps on Cameo's back to the top of the charts just like she did with ""Genius of Love"" and ""Hey DJ."" Blame Puff Diddy? Naw, place the blame on the sample queen supreme herself, Mariah Scarey."
1,Oh My Goodness!!!!,"This song belongs to the birds. I have never heard such horrible crap in my life. And it's really sad because Mariah has so much to prove and the only thing she has proven is her ex-husband is the reason for her success. Now the rumor is her new label Virgin Records is firing the people who brought her to the label. They also want to get rid of her because they don't think she's worth $20 million an album. And now, she wants people to believe that her ex-husband is the reason for her declining career. I don't buy that, she's doing that job well by herself. PS. Avoid the album at all cost!!!!"
1,Steaming pile of crap!,"I am very disappointed in this pile of crap. It may be harsh but it's true. With loverboy Mariah proves that without a doubt this is a contender for the worst single release by a big popstar in years. What is she even singing? Now I am a fan of the old Mariah, but this is just unlistenable. What idiot decided this should get released? Surely there has to be a better song on the Glitter album than this. She is killing her already rapidly eroding career, and her fanbase is dwindling down into the hundreds stateside - her career abroad has pretty much been dead since Butterfly.This is just downright embarrassing. I can honestly say that when I hear the song or see its video I turn red, and it isn't because she has little clothing on - I am truly embarrassed for her. I think it's safe to say that Mariah's successful career has come to a screeching hault. Mariah has really proven to be the epitome of the dumb blonde persona."
5,Excellent song,I love this song. When I first heard it I ran out and bought the Single. She is the only artist I know who can remix a song and it still sounds great!! Unlike J.Lo who can't sing a lick.Us
1,scraping the bottom of the barrel,"Oh, why isn't it possible to give zero stars? Mariah's descent started a couple of albums ago and has surely now reached its nadir. And that's without the trailer trash video in which our Mariah proves once and for all that she aspires to be Samantha Fox. Back to the song - what song? There isn't one, and just because she can hit those high notes, doesn't mean it's good singing either. Total rubbish!"
4,A little tricky to get to work,Used this to enclose a 7 ft x 2 ft x 5 ft area. I needed to be fairly liberal with the measurements to get it covered (I used the whole roll)
2,Where's Quality Control??,"I just bought this game for my kids and most of the player names are wrong. Batistuta is Batistini, Owen is Owe, Buffon is a the new stylish hairdo Bouffant and Seaman is Seabird. Someone needs to learn the name of the players or at least learn how to type. The screen is Dark and the players are tiny. Get a magnifying glass for this one. The only redeeming thing is the adventure of finding out how they butchered the rest of the names ""the kids are having a good laugh""Hey David B. did you really authorize this??"
2,alright for younger kids,"I bought this cd for performing at a christmas party type thing in my city, it was definitely not appropriate for that. The backup singers are in too much and in some songs it sounds like they are singing the entire song, it sounds ... like something you would hear in your kindergarten class. So unless you are planning on singing these songs with younger kids, I would not recommend it."
2,Timolino Travette Tea Server,"I have purchaced this tea server in the past (smaller 20 oz. size) and it had a mesh basket for steeping which was much better. The 34 oz. one I just purchaced has a plastic basket which lets smaller tea leaves into the container, your cup when pouring and then of course into your mouth when drinking. I spoke with a representative of the company and they indicated that their development team is working on getting the mesh basket into the 34 oz. but no ETA. I was able to order the mesh basket from them though at $3.00 plus shipping. I was hoping for FREE since the pictures on amazon (who they suggest purchasing through on their website) show the mesh basket but no success. Guess $3.00 plus shipping is not bad to keep the tea leaves out of my teeth in the morning! :)"
1,Broken,"Computer will not recognize my k800i with this cable, the original cable that comes with the phone works fine."
2,Fell Apart,Good idea bad execution. We thought it would be a helpful item when teaching our young children to learn how to fly a kite. It fell apart the first time we used it. Definitely not worth the money.
4,i have to agree with the other reviewer....so be careful on install...,"these storage containers are awesome....but the little plastic pegs are quite brittle. so unpack it carefully, install it carefully and hope you do not forget when you move it. BUT...once installed.... it is great... and ideal addition to the pegboard fanatic's 'habit'!"
4,Really quite good,I just ordered five more and am waiting for delivery. That should tell you that they are quite good at holding small parts.
4,lilo-stitch-soundtrack,"it's one of the best soundtracks i ever heard! a mix of good old rocken roll and fresh holliday sounds that brings summerfeelings whenever you hear it!so if you're still missing THE summerhit for this year, you'll shurely find it on this cd!"
2,The remastering stinks,"I love the content of this CD, but I must say the remastering job is the pits. It starts off okay, but about halfway through it starts to sound muffled. My favorite song, ""Loving Her Was Easier"", has no high frequency content at all. I've heard this album on LP, and sad to say, the LP sounded better. And be forewarned: ""Loving Her Was Easier"" also sounds lousy on the 3-disc set ""Revolutions of Time."" It sounds as if they just lifted it from this CD. Shame on you, Legacy!"
3,Sounds Like Willie Is Singing Under A Pillow,I love this album and on vinyl the sound is OK. But the cd sounds like it's made from third generation cassete. What a huge dissapointment. There is no way this disc is made from the original tapes. Don't buy this disc unless a remastered version comes out.
4,Willie,What a combination--Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson!!!Product well packaged and received in a timely manner. Very good condition.
3,Willie sings Kris,"Willie's great, and so is Kris. I was hoping for a more than just the 9 selections in the CD."
3,Somber Willie,"I don't know, this just didn't make it for me. Some of the instrumentals are great, but it lacks some angst. Also shows its age abit, as it was done in the 70s."
4,Not the old willie!,"Not quite what I hoped it would be. Obvious, Willie is not the singer he use to be."
1,pragmatically speaking,"If you can get a vinyl copy of this album, you will notice that on the back cover there is a close up head shot of willie and kris together. If you place the back side of this album slightly under the covers of your bed while still exposing the majority of the picture, you can make it look like they're in bed together. other than that, this album is not of much use."
1,Willie's album for the IRS,"Willie was nailed for tax evasion and had to come up with some cold hard cash-fast!! What was the quickest way of getting some cash? Doing an album of Kristofferson songs. It sounds like he knocked this albuim off in about 40 minutes. The music was alreadly recorded by half-assed studio musicians. Willie waltzed into the studio and laid down the vocal track. No time or effort went into this album. The result is heartless music, void of depth and emotion."
3,They work,"Not the best, but if your brake pads are worn down and squeaky, these will be a welcome change. My brakes now have a decent grip and don't squeak. I'm not sure how long they'll last, but even if it's just a year or two, it will be worth it. For the price, you can't beat them."
4,Mystics and wanderers,"I read these short stories before heading off on a trip to the middle east and north africa. Eberhardt's extrodinary life detailed in the introduction by Paul Bowles is as interesting as her stories - especially as a female negotiating the Arabian world of the mystics. Her short pieces are sometimes eloquent petitions for the rights (and the joy and the rewards) of the peniless wanderer. I was inspired and it kept the business of worrying about money, and the motives of the many hospitable and amazing people I have met in these regions in check."
3,"Disturbing, Suspiscious Collection","Isabelle Eberhardt's collection of short stories is intriguing. It is a bit dark yet uses beautiful imagery, esp of the natural surroundings of the Algerian Desert (Sahara). However, be forewarned that most of these stories were put together after her untimely death, and may not all be her own. Only the last 2 can be confirmed as penned by her word for word."
1,mini sd 4gb,This memory really i dont recomend because it doesnt work on any device even on my pc and lapto i dont know why and i returned and i bought a sankdisk and that one is pretty nice
1,It's a theft case,"Don't be mislead, this is a theft case. The case comes empty without any memory at all. No body makes a 4 GB miniSD so don,t get be fooled by it."
1,Didn't work for me -- But seller promised refund.,"I purchased this product and couldn't get it to work on a PC, laptop, or pda (cingular 8125). Not only does it not register in any SD/MiniSD card reader, but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well. I am currently pursuing a refund."
1,It did not work,I had to return the card because it did not work. Not sure if this was a fluke or represents a larger problem with this provider.
1,half star review....didn't work,"This product did NOT work in 4 different new media workstations (one of the pre-packaged gateways that are supposed to be able to handle all common portable media), my moto-q, my gateway laptop, or my friend phone...Seems ALOT of people have had the same problem. I'm trying to return it for either a replacement, or swap it for 2- 2gb normal mini-sd cards."
5,Great Pillow,I purchased this pillow to stuff a cover my daughter bought for herself. It fit perfectly and it's plump and will last her leaning on it to watch tv for years to come!
3,goodbye Willis Hello tigers,"Great album. Nice smooth sound, and arrangement. A little mellow at times but the uptempo tunes really kick ..."
2,6TH RATE PAUL SIMON RIP OFF,"I have seen this band develop in Seattle clubs over the years - first as Willis and now as the Actual Tigers. At first listen, this record seems pleasant enough - crystalline production, good musicianship. After a few more listens it becomes clear that these songs are nothing more than lyrically weak ditties cribbed from the portfolio of Paul Simon circa Graceland. The Actual Tigers see themselves as an ""Indie Band"" - listen to this record and you will see what a laughable, ridiculous notion this is. They have more in common with Air Supply that Sparklehorse or the Flaming Lips. Disappointing and boring. I guess that's why the label that signed them (Capitol) decided to ship them off to a Canadian indie (Nettwerk)."
3,Good oats at twice the cost of Walmart rolled oats,"I eat oatmeal for breakfast every day. Nutritionally the Old Wessex brand is identical to Walmart's Great Value Old Fashioned Rolled Oats. The price of the Old Wessex oats is $2.42 a pound and the Walmart oats cost $1.14 a pound. So my yearly cost for Wessex is $106.50 and for Great Value it is $50.16. Thus the Old Wessex oats cost $56.34 more per year. The Old Wessex oats definitely taste better, no question about that. But do I want to spend $56.34 more per year for the identical nutrition? I don't choose to spend that extra money."
5,rachel perry products,I have been using Rachel Perry products for about 20 years. They are reasonably priced and work just as good if not better than the higher priced brands. Everyone tells me what beautiful skin I have. One thing in particular I like is that there are two nighttime creams that you switch off every other night. That way your skin does not get tired of the same cream. Very smart. I highly recommend this brand.
3,17,"You know the record. You know the Living in the Past songs. In case you don't know 17, it's an eight-measure phrase repeated nine times (the eighth and ninth repetitions are instrumental, and the ninth is a fade-out). The phrases uses just two chords, tonic and subdominant, an A major triad and a D major triad, approximately two measures each. The sparse vocal part involves just five pitches spanning a major sixth (a pentatonic scale), of which the upper two (E and F#) are used just once per eight-measure phrase. I can't completely make out the rambling lyric. (17 first made its appearance on 20 Years of Jethro Tull.)"
4,"An incredibly varied album , funny as well as moving","I found this album on vinyl by accident many years ago .I liked the cover and went from there .I don't love every song , but the ones I enjoy , I will always love for the feelings they evoke .There are a number of styles covered but never having heard songs like this on any other album , I can't compare them to any other band - that would be inappropriate anyway .The album moves through a number of moods , uses interesting instrumental textures and is extremely eccentric , adventurous , vibrant and surprising .What more could a listener want ?If you've not heard it , I encourage you to pick it up ."
4,The First Real Tull Album.,"Jethro Tull's first album ""This Was"" never sounded like a Jethro Tull album to my ears. ""Stand Up"" was the first Jethro Tull album I heard, and I loved it from the very beginning. Some many great melodic tunes, and a new exciting was of playing the flute. The classical based ""Bouree"" was a clear favourite in the beginning, but soon the other songs grew on me.Their blues inspitation shines through on many songs like the great opener, ""A New Day Yesterday"" and ""For a Thousand Mothers""There are quiet thoughtful songs like ""Look Into the Sun"" and ""Reasons For Waiting""; acoustic tunes; ""Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square""""Nothing is Easy"" shows them at their most rocking.""We Used to Know"" is one of the great highlights - beautiful melody.Of the 4 bonus tracks, ""Living in the Past"" is a great song ""Sweet Dreams"" is also good.My favourites are: ""We Used to Know"" ""A New Day Yesterday"", ""Back to the Family"", ""Look into the Sun"", ""Bouree"" and ""Living in the Past"""
5,Masterpiece. Not a bad track.,"This is an early Tull masterpiece that should be in every CD collection. ""Reasons for Waiting"" still gives me chills each time I listen to it. It is that beautiful. ""Look Into the Sun"" is also gorgeous. The rest of the songs are equally masterful. I can only imagine hearing this album when it first came out. It must have knocked everyone's socks off. But even 34 years later, it's better than just about anything else that's popular today."
4,Still Great After All These Years!!!,"After purchasing their first album ""This Was"" when I was in high school, I eagerly awaited the release of their second album, which of course, is ""Stand Up"". I only hoped it would be as good as the first album. Lo and behold, it was even better. The songs, the muscianship, the quality are simply superb and amongst the best albums of the late 60's. Highlights include ""A New Day Yesterday"", ""Bouree"", ""Nothing is Easy"", ""Living in the Past"" and ""Driving Song"". However, the overall quality of the songs is an improvement over ""This Was"", so I rate it slightly higher. This is a must CD for any avid Jethro Tull fan."
4,This album best displays jethro tull's diversity,"With a combination of classical music,""Bouree,"" and some the best produced acid rock of the times, ""Look Into the Sun,"" this album should be a favorite of jethro tull fans who tire from the band's overplayed tunes on the FM stations like ""Teacher"" and ""Aqualung."""
4,Retrieving my youth...,This is one of the albums I liked in the 70's. Great to listen to on motorcycle rides...
5,Definitely my favorite Jethro Tull album.,Very few albums from the late 60's have stood the test of time as this one has. I have been looking for it for sometime on CD so was happy to see it finally released.
5,Bravo!!,"This CD and ""Benefit"" should have been made into a double LP/CD set. They are only mirrors of each other and more or less a continuation of each other. Stand Up and Benefit are Jethro Tull's Shining Stars. I rest my case."
5,Stand up stands up,"Simply the best Tull album ever. This record has stood the testof time. Fitting name, Stand Up. If you like Tull you need to add this to your collection."
2,From an outsider...,I stumbled on this book while websurfing. It seemed promising until I realized it was another book far too couched in Christian language for me to get anything out of it. Most of what Fox talks about is what I had to leave the church a long time ago to find out. Now some intelligent Christian authors are trying to catch up with the diversity of a new culture. Sorry; this book didn't grab me.
5,Hard to Find Full Length European Trance Tracks!!,"I love the Deep Trance Series. You get 3 CDs of rare full length trance tracks by top acts like DJ Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, and Josh Gabriel. Great set! Great price!"
4,Proof of the fact that money does not buy everything!!,"This book appealed to me because I have always been fascinated with the high-society lives of teenagers my age, especially those livng in Manhattan. Crissy, the main charcter, is smart, talented, and witty. She learns that things aren't always what they may seem, and that money and being ""on the A list"" doesn't necessarily bring one happiness. Read this book if you are interested in the upper-class lifestyle....it will teach you a lot."
4,Book review for McIntyre 4th per.,I think this is a slightly realistic story on how it compares with teens lives today. i like the scandalous twists that exaggerates societies bad sides. it's one of my faveorite books to read.
2,Disappointing effort to relate to teenagers,"Friends to Die For, a novel set in the '90s New York, is lacking in character. At first glance, it seems like a typical teen novel. However, it soon becomes boring and unrelated. The book tries to pull lures from mystery, suspense, and murder but truly fails in all three. The scenes are not as well written as they could have been, destrying even more of the book. I enjoyed a few small parts, but the book never really interested me. Certainly not a one sitting read, as it fails to hold interest.This isn't one of the best books I've ever read, but not the worst. Still, disappointing."
3,Berlioz Requiem,"It's impossible to rate this CD. You need to show more detail. Berlioz is the composer, not the performer! Which orchestra, which conductor?"
1,A very UN-Christian Perspective!,"In this book, John Ankerberg continues his anti-Masonic bias by continuing to promote his lies about Freemasonry. Mr. Ankerberg has made a career of lies and half-truths in a sensational manner about Freemasonry to sell his tapes and books! This is just another in a long series designed only to put money in Ankerberg's pockets. It certainly does NOT relate to Freemasonry in any truthful manner! Save your money! Buy ANY other book!"
1,waste of time & effort,"Started to read the book and lost interest immediately. The Authors in truth do not have much information on Freemasonry. Neither was a Mason. This book is using Religion as a means to scare people into believing things about Masonry that simply are not true. If a person wants to learn about Masonry I suggest reading a good book ""Born in Blood"" By John J. Robinson or contact a Lodge in his city or via e-mail. Sincerely & Respectfully, Manny Blanco"
2,Amusing at times but as a whole is inaccurate,"As a man that has spent years studying the connection between Freemasonry and the Bible, I have to say that like ""The Da Vinci Code"", this book too is amusing at times but as a whole is inaccurate. Many of the assumptions made about Freemasonry are unfounded or make such huge leaps that it is difficult to accept. Many of the attempts at using scripture to back up specific claims were pulled out of context, misinterpreted, or twisted and forced into a conversation. If Freemasonry was so anti-Christian, the claims and evidence should fall into place. The evidence does not do this because modern-day Freemasonry is indeed NOT anti-Christian.I enjoy reading books that challenge my way of thinking because one of two things will occur. Either I will find a flaw in my ways and see light that wasn't available before or I will further realize that I'm on target. In this case, it is certainly the later."
1,SELF-SERVING EVANGELIST GARBAGE!,"Look at their motives before believing a word they say. The leaders of the various groups defined as the religious right are cult leaders, guilty of the grossest forms of priestcraft. They are driven by a LUST to first gain political, economic, spiritual and mental control of their followers, then of YOU and YOUR children. They fear Masonry because it has always stood for freedom of conscience. PROOF: Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Stalin, and the Ayatollah have all persecuted Masons. That should convince any thinking person who loves the next man's freedoms as much as his own, that these guys are the sheep in wolf's clothing, the very devils they accuse Masons of being."
4,Good overview of Masonic worldview,"This book provides a thorough inquiry into the question of whether a Masonic world view is compatible with a Christian worldview. The authors do an excellent job of refuting the assertion by many Masons that Freemasonry is not a religion, and that it is compatible with evangelical Christian beliefs. Christians who are involved in Freemasonry will be challenged by this book, and it provides an excellent resource to Christians with friends and relatives in Freemasonry."
3,wow!,"This book, to me, is very interesting because it's a graphic novel that some girls can relate to. I mean like they have a bad life. I didn't expect anything like it. I opened it thinking it was just a regular comic book, but it wasn't. It's good for older teens to read because, to me, it tells you about the dangers of teenage life. For example, having low self esteem, drinking and having sex. It shows people what girls these days would do to feel happy about themselves. I think it's really bad to think that way about yourself. It's not good to have anyone under 14 reading it, even though it has a lot of bad content and is not good for anyone in my opinion. But I would not recommend it for other young teen girls to read, but for older teens from about 17 and up, because they would probably understand what is going on."
1,It would be best to find another book on this subject.,The book has a rather caustic introduction stating that other fluid mechanics books fail to properly teach the subject.Extensive use of wierd units such as slugs/ft3 make rather simple problems difficult. Many problems are reduced to exercises in unit manipulation.No references for equations or tables are given to enable further study on a particular subject.Lack of symbol definitions complicate reolution of problems.
3,Disappointment.... at its finest.,"Well I bought this book and the only good thing about it was that it gives sort of a good overview to everything that goes into running a haunted house. The bad thing is it was way too short. I opened the book and read it in a matter of hours. It's just over a hundred pages and a lot of the space is taken up by worthless illustrations and example forms. The room designs are for the most part stupid, (I got maybe 2 good ideas I will use) and it doesn't elaborate on anything important really. However this book is a must, soley for the fact that it is one of the only books out there on the subject."
1,the last marshall 1999 scott glenn,the person that created this dvd forgot to turn the subtitles off and had spanish subtitles which you could not turn off. ruined the whole movie. dont waste your money on this
2,Pugster,"I ordered earrings and they never arrived. After two weeks, I inquired and was told they would ship them ""again"" ASAP. Another two weeks went by, and still nothing. However, once I requested a refund, that was promptly processed within 48 hours. That's the only thing positive that happened in this experience."
3,Some good info but misleading title.,"The first part of the book covers Tesla's mechanical oscillator (principle of operation, etc.). Later, a series of blueprints are presented to detail the construction of a small oscillator. A knowledgable person with access to machining equipment should be able to construct one with the information provided. It will not, however, guide you through the proccess! It simply presents the ""bare bones"" info. After that, the book strays from its title. There is some rather strange talk about alternative religion and some Zen philosophy stuff. Then, were shown text and construction info for some other neat devices (heat pump, motors, etc.). Anyone who enjoys science or wants to build an ""Earthquake Machine"" will probably be satisfied with the content. Be prepared for some of the off topic discussion though.Adam Parker"
2,Earthquake machine,"I was hoping that this book would shed some light on the concept of creating artificial earthquakes. Instead, it was loaded with ideas and inventions that had NOTHING to do with Tesla's Earthquake machine. There is one little chapter, and they should seriously change the name of the book."
3,A place to start,"The book has loads of theory. The plans for an oscillator are fair and will give you a place to start. A mention is made that it resembles a modern control solenoid, agreed, but perhaps should include salvaging parts from other such items to build up one. Im sure it could be done, and once again this book gives a start. In any case it does show how to use a commercially available air vortex unit for heat and cooling, in conjunction with the oscillating device."
3,AOR Lite,"Does a band qualify as a ""supergroup"" if its membership is made up of relatively unknown session musicians from Eddie Money, Air Supply, and the Storm? Whatever you call them, Ransom features vocalist/guitarist Tommy Girvin (Eddie Money), bassist Don Cromwell (Air Supply), and drummer Ron Wisko (the Storm).Given the players involved, it's no big surprise that Ransom's 1997 album Trouble in Paradise tends towards the lighter side of AOR. In fact, I'm not really sure the ""R"" in AOR is appropriate, since the band sounds more like adult contemporary than rock. It's well done if you like this kind of lighter, poppier AOR. If you're looking for an album that rocks however, you'll probably want to skip this one, as its heaviest moments barely reach the Eddie Money/Brian Adams level."
4,Bringing the Magic Back In,"Moore addresses a very important question: How can we bring back magic into our lives? We are used to living in a rational, practical society, argues the author, with the result that we have neither time, nor ability to stop, think, and savor the strangeness and beauty of things. We have over-rationalized our existence to the point where spirituality suffers. Some things, the authors counsels are, well... not very practical. Can we really afford to keep old and dilapidated buildings because they can enchant us when we intentionally romanticize them? But the utility of Moore's book lies in learning how to accept what is and endow it with spirit, magic, and meaning. Even if we must grow up, we need not give up the romantic spirit that makes life fascinating."
2,Thomas Moore's Writing is Somewhat Shapeless in this book,"I like Thomas Moore's work, but find him difficult and sometimes impossible to follow. He rambles about things that are not connected to his subject. He has much to say but doesn't always say it succinctly. He floats from idea to idea without any real practical application for daily life, at least for this average Jane. This is definetly not one of Moore's better works."
2,Uninteresting and dull.,"After borrowing Moore's first two books from the library, I decided to purchase this one. The book has now been donated back to the library. It was forced and uninteresting. Maybe someone else can find it enchanting. I just thought it boring."
5,LOVE IT,"I love this color! It is very simple and you need to do at least 2 coats to see just that light touch of color. I don't like colored nail polish on my finger nails because I have pale hands. This is a warm color and when I tried it at the salon, I just had to have a bottle of my own."
2,Not for Intermediate Programmers or Beginners,"As have other reviewers, I found this book gives enough information to get me in trouble or to get me frustrated but doesn't give enough details or explanations or even examples to get me out of them. You could do several things using the book but if you tried to do something very different from what he illustrated you'd probably get mysterious error messages and little or no help understanding what the problem is.I have used the Missing Manual for going from Windows to Mac and found it far more helpful than this book.I'd urge you to spend a bit more and get something much more complete. I just bought ""Applescript The Definitive Guide (2'nd. ed.)"" by M. Neuburg and I'm hopeful it will meet my needs. I notice there are several other books available here for beginners and I'd consider some of them before getting this one."
4,Great introduction,"I have not programming background, but I do like automating as many tasks on my computer as possibly can. So for the last year or so I've been playing around with AppleScript, mainly copying the scripts I found from different sources, but along the way I'm slowly beginning to understand how to put together scripts almost from scratch. This book has been very resourceful because it has the familiar Missing Manual style of breaking the essential features of a program so that almost anyone can understand. Some of the examples in this book are not very practical, but for those who want to learn AppleScript, you won't waste your money and time getting and reading this book."
5,Great beginner reference,"Once again, the Missing Manual series comes to the rescue. Anyone wanting a comprehendible primer on Applescript should look no further. This book is well organized, advancing logically chapter by chapter. Like all Missing Manual books, it explains technical concepts in plain english."
2,More like a travel guide,"This is not a ""manual"" in any sense of the word. A manual tells you how, where, and when. This is more like a tour guide of Applescript. Sure there are scripts, but few of them make the Mac easier to use than its own OSX interface. The information is presented in such a scattered form, that it is hard to follow for very long, and therefore hard to learn. It's like trying to learn to be a chef by watching the Cooking Channel."
2,A bit off the mark...,"As a long time hobbyist, im not really impressed. This book doesn't really touch on too many of the 'hard' issues one would face when first getting started with applescript. The languages syntax, for example, is not as intuitive as its description suggests. Its english like, but its not english, and english takes a decade or so to master.The book says little about the language, and a disproportionately large part of it is just a series of example scripts categorized by the programs being scripted.This book is more like the answers to the test than the course that would prepare you for the test. I learned close to nothing from it.Im sure it has its place, but as someone pretty familiar with programming, I find that practical examples _aswell as_ some deeper, language directed discussion is nessesary to get anything other than a weak grasp on any language. Especially a language as slippery as applescript. But I guess I got what I paid for... its a pretty cheap book."
2,"Okay for beginners, not for programmers.","This book is very basic and doesn't really get into any depth. Rather than teaching the fundamentals of AppleScript, it's more of a guided tour to what you can accomplish with AppleScript in various common applications. For the average computer user, this may be helpful, but if you're a programmer and want to learn how to write your own scripts, other resources would be a better bet.I also wasn't impressed with the writing style or organization - while I *am* impressed that a high school student could write a book like this, for most technically inclined people, I'd look elsewhere."
2,OK as an introduction but lacks depth,"""Applescript - the missing manual"" is OK as an introduction to the basics of Applescript - it explains how to edit & run a script, gives a feel for what applescript looks like and what its capable of, and describes some useful tools - but I was disappointed by its coverage of the heart of the subject: the syntax of the language. To learn how to do anything even slightly beyond the examples given in the book (which are mostly rather trite) I had to go to the Applescript Language Guide, on the Apple developers site. This actually explains the language, though its way out of date and pretty heavy going.Overall, an OK book to get started but you'll need something more detailed to really use applescript. If you already know how to program, I'd recommend looking for something a bit more technical."
4,"To ""A reader""","I am sorry for your loss and will make no positioning to state I in any way know how you feel. However, if you had taken the tiny extra bit of time to look at this graphic novel you would have noticed that not a single artist or writer made money on this. It was all a voluntary work basis and all the profits, every last dime, went to charities to help those that lost loved ones in this human atrocity.Peace be with you."
2,A gimmick,"I tried the Hyaluronic Serugel and I feel like it's a gimmick. All it does is tighten the skin - like you have a clear, thin mask on. Maybe that's how you get an anti-wrinkle affect, like a botox shot that prevents you from moving your face. If you're looking for a moisturizer that makes your skin feel plump and healthy, this product won't do the trick. Spend your money on something else."
4,Young Life Friend,"Tony has a special gift for connecting heart felt feelings to gospel truth. The song, ""Why?"" pierces through the noise and confusion of life and allows us to see what is really going on from a higher plain. Songs like ""Found,""Lisa's ""Prayer"",and ""Our Father"" make you realize how personally God desires to know each of His creation.And, from a vocal standpoint, there is no better crooner anywhere! I highly recommend By Chance!"

4,Good Buy For The Right Price,"This is a great buy. I have not experienced any problems, plus you're only spending more money for the name."
4,Ghosts,"A broad, but entertaining, overview of how concept of ""ghost"" changed from ancient Greece to the twentieth century. Dr. Finucane's theory is that the ghost fills a social and cultural need. The Greek ghosts were insubstantial, ""gibbering and squeaking"". Roman ghosts were generally annoyed at being disturbed by the living. Medieval ghosts helped to form ideas of purgatory and reinforce the Church's authority. Ghosts helped to reassure the Victorians that there really WAS an afterlife.The book was published in 1996, but apparently written in the '80's. It's too bad there isn't a new edition dealing with all of the ""reality"" ghost shows!"
