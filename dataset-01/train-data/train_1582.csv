1,Don't throw out the box. It worked for less than a month.,I was so excited to take the Shark Sweeper home. It worked great until I needed to charge it. The motor never started again. I could not return it because I threw away the box. What a waste of $40.
5,Great little sweeper for the price,"This sweeper really does the job for me. When you have a small child, crumbs and such are the norm on a daily basis and I've grown tired of dragging out the large, heavy sweeper to clean up. This has solved that problem for sure. It picks up all the crumbs,cheerios, and other small dirt including hair and surprising to me, even dust. It does a way better job than I figured it would. It was very easy to put together, is very light weight, and I'm finding it to hold a charge quite well. I'm mainly using it on bare wood flooring too. A very handy sweeper all in all for a great price!"
5,Great litle sweeper!,I have had this sweeper for about a month & used it several times; it is handy between vacuums & great for touch-ups on my carpet. But I especially like it on my cermaic tile kitchen floor. It grabs everything & is easy to empty. No complaints yet!
2,The product is fine......Euro Pro is a problem,"I loved this when we first got it home. I'm handicapped and can't push a big vacuum. So, this was just right to pick up the ""top & showing"" dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week.But after two months the AC adapter cord just snapped in half. It was oddly brittle from the very beginning. I contacted Euro Pro who would not replace it under warranty. So, I ordered a new adapter from them (which came to approx. $15) with shipping. Now six weeks later, they sent me a card saying ""due to overwhelming demand....."" the adapter is on back order. I wonder why they have such a large demand? Funnily enough, the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it's last charge. But, no more. I think it's time to bury it and move onto an old fashioned (no power) push sweeper."
4,Great Little Gift!,"Okay, so it wasn't the most romantic gift I've ever received, but it sure is one of the most useful.This little sweeper makes quick pick-ups so easy, and I really enjoy the fact that it is very lightweight. Sure beats dragging out the big vacuum!By the way, you WILL need to bring out the big vacuum if you have heavy-duty cleaning to do. As I said, this is for quick pick-ups. (Which is why I gave it four-stars, I was hoping it would be able to handle the heavy stuff.)Maybe mom would like one for mother's day? She won't be swept off her feet, but she'll enjoy sweeping the floors much more! ;)"
4,I use this ALL the time,"I bought this sweeper because my 2 year old daughter is always getting into something. I hate dragging the big vacuum cleaner out to clean up her messes. While this does not have the suction power of my clumsy corded vacuum, it cleans up 90% of the messes she makes (including playdo pieces). The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star is I have noticed it generates a lot of carpet fuzz and I'm concerned this may be ""eating"" up my carpet. However, for less than $[...] I would definitely recommend this for easy daily clean ups."
2,Euro-Pro Shark V1725 Sweeper,I like this product but because it simply rotates the brush to bring items into the trash container - it will not pick up slightly heavy things. Great for a fast simple pick up though.**UPDATE**This sweeper did not stand the test of time. Was dissappointed. For the price it should have lasted longer. :(
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this to pick up little messes in between using my big vacuum. I have two birds, and I wanted something to pick up their food messes. It worked great at first, even on thick carpet. I was very surprised by how well it worked. But just like a lot of the other reviews about it, it broke quickly. It started making a loud clunking sound and it won't pick up dirt anymore. Amazon won't give me a replacement because it's been more than 30 days. According to so many bad reviews about it, it seems almost guaranteed to break. So save your money for something better."
2,Save your money,"This is a simply awful cordless sweeper. It gets no where near the edges of a room so after using this item you must use a broom for the edges, not exactly a time saver. The battery lasts a very long time, probably due to the complete lack of suction the vacuum provides....SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,Good Product,It's quiet and holds a charge for a long period of time. Worthwhile purchase for small areas or RVs!
5,I use this at least 5 times a day!!,"I have 3 kids ages 5 and under... this is my lifesaver! This is such a great tool for quick cleaning up of crumbs after meals/snacks and even craft activities. I only use it on our hardwood floors and leave the carpet for our Dyson. If you are in need of something to leave things spotless, I suggest a broom and mop. But, if you want something that can pick up 99% of crumbs so you aren't tracking them around, this has worked well for us! :) (My 4 & 5 year old kids also love to use it, with supervision... bonus!)"
2,Dissapointing,"I purchased this little sweeper to sweep up bird seed and crumbs on the floor from the kids. For the bird seed it's ok as long as you make a couple passes. For food and feathers it seems to pick up about half. Also, I've only had this sweeper 6 months and the battery slowly died and I always fully discharged and then charged the battery. I would suggest getting anopther sweeper that has suction and not just a revolving brush."
1,Horrendous customer service!,"We purchased our Shark Quick and Quiet last January. In July, the battery died. I went to the Euro-Pro website and ordered a new battery. That was in JULY! It is now OCTOBER, and we have received 3 postcards from Euro-Pro saying:""Due to the large response, the item you've requested is temporarily out of stock. WE have ordered new stock to cover all orders. you may expect delivery in 3-4 weeks.""It is obvious they have a problem with either the product design which causes so many dead batteries, or their supplier.Whichever one is the root cause, I have a worthless piece of junk sitting in my utility room which I can't use.Just furious~"
1,Been through 3 of these in a year's time,"This little sweeper works so great in the beginning. My first 2 worked great and then the battery wouldn't hold a charge. After a month each, I couldn't get the sweeper to run for more than a minute before the battery would die, and that was on a full charge. This 3rd and final sweeper motor died after 5 months, I turn it on and I can hear a low wurring sound, but not the roller won't budge and the roller is completely clean."
1,Don't buy this sweeper.,I had this sweeper for all of two months before it died. I can't get any response from the company regarding the warranty. It never worked that great to begin with - I'd always have to use the broom after using this sweeper. I'll never buy another Shark product.
1,For about a MONTH - it worked great,"This product is wonderful until after about 2 months.After a few months - mine stopped working.And this was my second - the first stoped working after 3 months.I just got off the phone with customer service and they tell me that for another ~$20 I can get a factory refurbished replacment.In my opinion, Euro-Pro demonstrated to me today that they will not stand behind their product. I will never buy another cordless product of theirs."
4,Does the job,I own the Shark and use it all the time...it is light and quiet....it does the job for a light clean up. I actually just ordered my second one for my 4 year old grandson's birthday.....he loves to vacuum and gets mad when his parents put the vacuum away. We took one of the bars off of the handle and it is just his size.....the house is nice and clean!!! He loves it!!! LOL
2,Almost a good product,"We used this Shark Sweeper for about two weeks. It picked up everything that would fit under it. If you use it near pet areas, it picks up hair like crazy, and you will have to empty it more often. Quiet as advertised. The power is enough for a sweeper of its size. The Shark works well on high-traffic carpet and kitchen flooring. The reason for two stars is that the handle broke off the unit at the base -- unexpectedly. As far as I can see, there isn't any way to remove the remaining piece of handle. Now the unit is a hand-held sweeper. I will contact the manufacturer and see if there is anything I can get from them to fix it."
2,"Works well a couple times, then hard to clean and weak!","Not good for areas with pet hair, it gets clogged in brushes and requires extensive and messy cleaning. Loses power gradually and is generally not very good at sucking hair and dirt. Disappointed in overall, long-term performance. Got louder over time."
5,I LOVE my shark!,"I purchased my shark back when they were a new item; I still have my first one all these years later and it still runs great. You just have to follow the instructions to fully discharge the battery before you charge it again and it will keep going and going and going.After a few dog tumbles, we 'carpeted' our kitchen with those sticky-backed carpet squares, and the shark cleans the kitchen floor better than our vacuum. It's also great for all those quick little emergency jobs without lugging out the big vacuum or spot cleaning when company is coming and you don't have time to vacuum. I also use it several times a week to clean up the cat genie granules the cats track a good 15' away from their cat genie.When this trusty old fellow finally gives up the ghost, I will definitely cough up the money to replace it."
3,Shark sweeper,"Tried the Swivel Sweeper. Dust picked up, kept falling out of thesmall dust tray. This happen at the very beginning before the traywas full. Battery lasted long time on the Swivel.Main problem with Shark is the battery only last around fifteenminutes. Used right after a couple of days charging . Luckily I onlyneed about fifteen minutes of use. This is my second Shark and bothdidn't hold a charge very well."
1,Waste of money,"The euro-pro shark sweeper used to be a great sweeper-I don't know what they have done to them-but they are a piece of junk now. Work o.k. for awhile,then just quit. Would definetly not reccomend this product to anyone!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Too cheap to last,"For 5 months, the wood floors in my kitchen and dining room were wonderfully clean, thanks to this little vacuum which we used whenever there were crumbs or dirt. Then the handle broke off. As you would expect, this thing is made out of plastic and it just doesn't last. I recommend against buying a ""disposable"" vacuum. Save your money and the environment."
1,Useless sweeper,"I bought this sweeper and tried for a week to like it, but it hardly picks up a thing on my hardwood kitchen floor. Forget about using it on rugs, too. It's simply a sweeper with no suction that randomly picks up debris from the floor. Maybe after the 4th pass the floor will start looking clean. I returned the sweeper and picked up a Eureka Quick-up for about $10 more and it works great! Don't waste your time on the Shark."
2,Stopped working after a while.,"This vaccuum was actually very good, when it worked, but after about a month it completely just stopped working. It wasn't because of the batteries or charging. I do not recommend any of the Shark products. I have bought three vaccuums from Shark, and they all just stopped working after a while."
3,So-so,"If you're limited in your hand mobility, DON'T buy this sweeper ... odds are you won't be able to empty the ""dust container"" without help.And if you're looking for anything with even half the suction of a Dust Buster, look elsewhere. Not only does the sweeper leave dirt after the first direct pass, but it deposits tiny patches of whatever it just picked up a moment earlier, especially anything grainy, such as litter. The fuller the dust container, the more likely it is that you'll see leftovers, but the problem happens even when the container is empty.Pros: Sweeper is light weight, easy to maneuver with a low profile, and the battery life is good"
2,Worked well for 4 months then stopped.,"Like other reviewers I purchased this item 6 months ago and at first it worked great. Then, out of nowhere, it stopped picking up dirt. Called the company where they also tried to get me to spend more money to get the thing fixed but I refused and threatened to report them. They agreed to send a battery pack for no charge. Unfortunately, the new battery was not the issue and it still doesn't work. I called back again and if I was willing to spend the shipping money, they would fix it for free. Since the item only cost me 30.00 to begin with it's not worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM..."
1,Not well built,"The cordless sweeper was delivered on 10/15/09 and stopped working about 15 days later. There was a smell of burning rubber, probably the belt that moved the rotating brush was binding, then the brush just stopped. Given its performance not worth repairing."
3,"Ok, not great","I bought this sweeper to use on my tile in my new house. I have a few cats and they will get litter on the tile. This sweeper works pretty good for what I bought it for. I can't see using this sweeper at all on carpets, it just doesn't work on carpets or rugs. On the tile however it does pick up larger items, cat hair and little scraps of paper. I do have to go slow and sometimes go over the area twice for it to pick up really well for me. The product itself seems a little cheaply made though, I was expecting better, however I am not very disappointed, just a little. I haven't had any problems with the battery or charging it so far."
3,"Works great, then breaks","This unit does a great job of picking up dirt and dust. After about 4 months it becomes extremely noisy because the drive slips, making it ineffective. There is no easy way to fix this."
3,Euro-Pro Shark V1725,"Having owned several other Shark models, I was disappointed to find that this one was a stripped down version, without even the usual silver finish. After using it for about a month, I am already finding that the drive belt is making noise when it runs. For the price I paid, I expected a bit more."
1,Completely disappointing,"I returned this item to the store after one week. The cordless that I really wanted was out of stock so I bought this one. It is the worst I have ever used. Not only did you have to go over and over something before it would pick up, but half the time it would shoot it out the back, particularly if you were vacuuming a tile floor. I would not waste my money on this one."
2,"Good, but no cigar","I don't like this product but it's mostly because I didn't read the specs carefully enough. I thought it was a sweeper vac. It's not. It's just a rather anemic sweeper, good for only the most trivial touch-ups."
3,Shark,The Euro Shark is an OK sweeper. It only picks up from the front and that makes it a little slow. I like it for picking up on carpeting rather than on tile floors. It seems to get the small pieces of lint and hair very good.
2,not good for fine dust,"Has some use, but if picking up fine dust from a hard floor it blows out the front."
1,Complete Garbage,"This produce is complete garbage. I ordered one, charged it completely, and when I used it for the first time, it started making a horrendously loud noise. I exchanged it for another one. After I fully charged the second sweeper, the battery would not last for more than 30 seconds before it shut off. I returned it that same day. My last sweeper lasted four years and I did not have a single complaint. Guess their quality control division is on an extended vacation...."
4,Works even on wool rugs,"Euro-Pro Shark V1725 Quick-and-Quiet 10-Inch Cordless SweeperEasily the best $20 I have spent on something for my apartment. Which small so things get dirty much faster.I have two cats, one of which is a huge fellow with long hair. Also I have these very tightly woving wool durmas I think they are called. UGHVaccum cleaners did nothing, unless I used it everyday, and I mean everyday! Shark gets everything up, plus it cleans so well now i only have to used clean once a week.Belive the infomercial. It is that good. I really hope this helps.My ONLY complaint is that you can not go backwards or the stuff bunches and comes out. Usually it just means you have to empty the container."
3,Buy only if you are looking for hard surface sweeper,Works ok on flat or hard surfaces only. Will not pick up on even the shortest pile of rug. A bit disappointing.
3,Charge Problem,Followed directions regarding not leaving plugged in but unit does not work but a few minutes before it runs very slow or stops.
2,Shark Sweeper,This shark product is nowhere near the quality of the first shark I purchased about 6 years ago. This has certainly been cheapened and I am now looking for one of their older models.
2,Not much suction,I don't suggest this unit unless you are picking up hair. I purchased a another brand after this because anything over the weight of a cat hair won't go into it.I don't recommend it.
2,CCRCA5,I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS ITEM. THE SUCTION IS VERY POOR.THE BATTERY LIFE IS MUCH LESS THAN STATED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS.Due to the poor suction it taked forever to do a room and since the battery life is so limited I barely get through 2 rooms before it needs to be charged again.
4,For a quick spruce up,This little sweeper is perfect for what I wanted it for: picking up crumbs and debris after a 15 month old toddler. I would not recommend it for major clean-up.
3,Nice as a broom and dustpan,Had mine for about a year or two. Just recently stopped working correctly. The rubber on the bottom work out. Now it scratches the floor. But when it worked I used it after I would sweep up my floor with a broom and then picked up the pile with the vac. I used it like a dustpan and this worked great. When I was in a hurry I would just go over the floor with the vacuum and it worked fine. I just recently purchased a different brand that has two brushes and is smaller and we will see what happens with that. I only bought the other brand because this vac was not available locally and I was too cheap to pay shipping.
1,Piece of CRAP!!,"After using one time, the sweeper began making a clunking noise. After charging the battery the second time, it would only last a few minutes before needing recharged. The manual says to charge several times to realize the battery's full potential. I did that and each time I charged it the amount of time it lasted got less and less. The last time I used it the motor started burning up (at least that is what it smelled like). Now it doesn't work at all. It makes a horrible noise when I turn it on and the brush doesn't spin. I have only had it just over a month. In order for me to use the warranty to get it fixed, they want me to pay to ship it back to them and enclose a check so they can ship it back to me. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap. If there is a sweeper out there with a lithium battery- go with that."
1,Cannot recommend this item,"This cordless sweeper was charged immediately when received. I was able to use it after it was charged. I have not been able to use it since as it will not charge. I do not use it often, therefore, [...] I called Shark, they told me to clean the battery and the inside unit. After doing this it still would not charge or work. I called Shark again, and they sent out a free new battery (after first wanting to charge me for the battery). This battery would not charge the unit either. After another call to Shark, they told me to clean this battery and the unit (which I had already tried). [...] Now I am waiting for the charger. Shark's customer service is horrible if you have a problem with one of their sweepers. According to the manual there is a one year warranty on the sweeper - they should be taking care of this problem in a more professional manner. I will never buy a Shark product again through mail order."
3,"Look Santa, no batteries",I loved this sweeper for the first 8 months I owned it - better than sliced bread for my busy work schedule and three cats. It worked amazingly well on my dark throws that tend to soak up my long hair's fur. Also did fine on both carpet and tile/hardwood. Last summer - my batteries died and I notice they say these need to be replaced every 6-12 months. I went on-line and ordered in July. It is now almost Christmas and I just keep getting these postcards saying it is on back order and to expect arrival. I re-ordered once and so I now get two sets of these postcards. My guess is Santa will arrive first and perhaps the Easter Bunny and the 4th of July parade. I hope that Easter bunny is short haired and Santa's beard is not shedding!!!
2,Falling out of love - The Honeymoon is Over!,I LOVED this little sweeper when I first got it! It was so light and so easy to use - and it picked up so much dirt and dog hair! It was so quiet and easy to maneuver! I didn't need my old broom and dust pan any more - my upright electrolux seemed so heavy and clutzy in comparison - and cleaning didn't seem as much of a chore.For about 2 months.I discovered that my little shark HATED the fringe on my oriental carpets. We had several little episodes before I finally stopped going near fringe - or loose threads - or electric wires.It also had issues with debris on bare floors - it liked to shoot them around on the floor so I could get more exercise chasing them!And now my little shark isn't so quiet - or so thorough - or so much fun.Would I buy one again - not for the $60+ I paid - especially since there are others out there that pick up going forward AND backward - but it still picks up stuff more easily than a broom and dustpan - just WAY louder!
3,good,"Nice to see some of the old acts, tiring to see others, overall worth the price. blah, blah, blah, blah"
4,If you have the other two volumes...,"you're obviously going to want this one as well. I'm not only a fan of the performances, but also the format of the show as well as the intimate setting. (which as the presenters describe, was a matter of circumstance more than design) The presenters themselves are extremely knowledgable about music and very well spoken without the hype that most Americans are used to when music performances and performers are being discussed. Quiet, serious discourse on the songs and excellent performances. I can't think of anything better.One other thing, it's actually cheaper to buy these separately than in the box set which is very unusual."
4,very good,"It is a good Kenshin sword, but it is a bit short compared to a traditional katana. The blade was very dull needs sharpening. It is a 440 stainless steel, so once sharped it should be good for a while. The handle is mostly a hard plastic, so it may get loose in the future. The sword will wiggle around in the sheath due to too must extra space in the sheath. All in all, it is a good sword for the price but is recommended to be on its mount."
4,First time purchase,"This was my first time purchasing a sword/katana, and overall I am quite satisfied. I don't know the names of all the parts, so I'll try my best. The blade seems very balanced and straight. The tsuba (guard?) seems pretty well made. The end cap on the handle is a little loose. All in all, for $35, this was a great first purchase. I have always been a fan of swords, so I think I may start a collection soon."
4,Nice!,"I love this sword. The blade is sharp, and the sword itself is well taken care of. Over all, I love this sword!"
4,Good,Its real nice. I don't get the correlation with the Last Samurai other than its a Katana. The Metal hand guard is really cool. the only problem is the clip on the sheath is not attach properly.
5,Awesome product,At first the sword was damaged due to handling when it was shipped. I called and they replied right away and sent a new sword free of charge. Awesome display item!
4,"good sword, 1 minor flaw","The sword it's self was in good condition minus the glue on the handle charm showing. The only part I didn't like was that the Tsuba kept coming loose. This is a shelf and cosplay item. As such it makes for excellent decoration! If you enjoy the anime Rurouni Kenshin or its forefather show Samurai X then this is the sword for you! Get it, you know you want it, what are you waiting for! lol seriousely though, it's a good sword and even with rough handle it can last a good long time."
3,Reverse Blade Katana Black with Stand,I got this just today and i did not get this sword i got a Ichigo Tensa Bankai Replica Sword so think before you order
2,Photo needs updated,The punches shown in the photo are made in the U.S.A. but the ones I received were made in India. I would not have paid over $30 for these if I had known they were not made in the U.S.
3,The only PAL Action Max game made,"Sonic Fury is said to be the only PAL (European) title released for the Action Max game system, and for good reason, it sucks!Could you imagine going to the store and purchasing a game system and finding out that it is not only horrible quality, but that the system only has one game? Anyhow, the only reason I would recommend buying this p.o.s. is if you like torturing yourself with bad games, or if you are a retro game collector, or console collector, and need this system to complete your console list, or are just curious about VHS games. Just check out the Action Max youtube reviews if you wanna know what it's like, and you will be glad you didn't buy the system in reality."
5,Is this the quintessential Neo-prog album?.....,"I don't what it is about this album that makes it so good. It must be that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It is like a distillation of what makes great Neo-prog - inventive use of time signatures and tempo, intricate interplay of instruments, lyrics that are about more than just sex, drugs and girlfriends, and the understanding that the song is more important than your 15 minute solo (something that was unfortunately lost on some of the original prog bands). Milliontown packages all this in a fantastically well-produced album."
5,You Gotta Here It,"With so much progressive rock that is really retrogressive (which is not necessarily bad)this band has a refreshing twist. I have certain bands I would consider modern progressive (I Mother Earth, Oceansize, and ____) but Frost does go beyond 70's bands like Yes, Kansas and Crack The Sky (who I love) to add a different sound. If the goal was to have a listenable progressive rock with a slice of pop, they hit the goal, but it goes beyond that. If there were a retrogressive 80's genre, this might fit that sound--1980's Rush fans will love it. I won't dissect every song, just listen and you'll love it. Black Light Machine is one of the best songs I've heard in quite a long time. It's got mood, great vocals, musicianship and it rocks! Buy this CD!"
4,I don't like much these days...,"...But I do like this. Even while listening to the title track and expecting it to end about 5 times, I should have been annoyed but not so.This is just well written, executed and produced Neo-Prog. It has it's hard moments and soft while maintaining a melodic atmosphere.I leave it at 4 stars becasue, well not much get's 5 stars.Too bad there will be no more from them (famous last words)."
4,New style,"I bought this a long time ago but don't listen to it much now, however it really is a cool cd although its a bit more ""poppy"" than i like. The sfx are nice, the lyrics are good, the composition itself is well done. Its really not a bad album just not one that I think ""oh man I really want to hear that track RIGHT NOW!"" like I do with some of my music."
3,False positives,"Starting deceptively sophisticated, the album recedes into more accessible neo-rock before dipping back into bold power progressive."
4,Good Stuff and True Progressive Rock,"I definitely enjoy current progressive rock bands like the Flower Kings or Spock's Beard, etc., but they do have a distinct retro feel to them (not necessarily a bad thing). Frost, on the other hand, is progressive rock for the new century. Crafted with up-to-date studio processing and industrial rhythms, Frost sounds different and fresher than many bands in the genre and is worth a spin for any fan of progressive rock. Warning: they do not sound like genesis, '70s yes or Pink Flyod, but more like Nine Inch Nails/Arena/Trevor Rabin era YesOne weakness is the vocal performance...or more specifically, the vocal recording/style. Frequently heavily processed, the vocals simply don't 'shine' or carry a song. In fact, in the begininng of the last track ""Milliontown"" the processed vocals are almost whispered growlings that conflict with the beautiful solo piano in the background.The weakness aside, this is a great effort that will get frequent play in my CD collection"
4,Refreshing,"The one word that comes to my mind after hearing this album is ""refreshing"". It's technical and progressive, melodic and fun. At times it reminds me of music from Sonic The Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis. This album sounds like a mix between Liquid Tension Experiment and Spock's Beard, with a dash of video game-esque influence. My favorite band is Dream Theater, so if you enjoy them, you'll probably like Frost*."
2,This should have remained on the drawing table.,I am a huge fan. I have read everything Ms. Gilchrist has published. Why this was published at all is a mystery. It did nothing but sully a stellar reputation. The characters were annoyingly transparent. Her usually rich lexicon seemed pedantic and forced. This book was published before Ms. Gilchrist could hone it with her usual grace. Somehow I blame it on the publishers. Too eager to meet a deadline? Signed her to a multiple book deal and pressed the issue? Something just does not set well.
1,entertaining but basically ****,"First of all, there are so many errors in this book, such as: Sarah takes 10mg of xanax when the usual dosage is between .5 and 2 mg.Secondly, the dialogue is pitiful. Just plain horrible.Thirdly, the characters are unreal. Sarah fails as a likeable protagonist--she is self-centered, cruel, and basically despicable. Her attitude towards Elise certaintly does not add to her charm--why does she repeatedly refer to Elise as ""ugly"" and blame Elise for the initial failed relationship with Jack?I cringed my way through this book wondering how it managed to get published in the first place."
1,"""Sarah Conley"" - a big disappointment","I have always enjoyed Gilchrist's novels for their off-beat humour and color. ""Sarah Conley"" has none of the same charm. Gilchrist keeps telling us what to think about her chracters but never shows us. Sarah and her lover, Jack, are supposed to be exceptional people - smart, accomplsihed and admirable. Instead they seem conventional, dull, and self-indulgent. The writing is laughably melodramatic and at the same time boring. It is difficult to care about what will happen. I only finished the book because I couldn't believe it would not redeem itself. It didn't."
2,Disappointment for Gilchrist fans,"I'm a big fan of Ellen Gilchrist's previous works. Over the years she has created a large array of fascinating characters, characters that take on a life of their own in the mind of the reader. In her latest book Ellen Gilchrist introduces a completely new cast and, unfortunately, doesn't make us care a whole lot for any of its members. The one character that seems most like it could have jumped out of her older books commits suicide . The storyline is sketchy and at times does not ring true. My advice: read or re-read her older books."
1,How did this woman win any fiction prizes?,"OK, I confess this is the first book by Ellen Gilchrest I've read. But the whole experience was excruciating. How could she take such a rich topic and destroy it with hackneyed dialog, completely flat characters and none of the texture that could be afforded by settings like Nashville, New York City and Paris? I'm not rushing out to buy any of her other books."
2,Boring,"When it became apparent to me that this book was boring, I kept reading anyway, simply because it was so bad. There is no one to like in this story. The self-centered, whiny characters don't even like each other. Jack and Eugenie don't like their kids. Eugenie didn't want them because she doesn't like kids. Yet she's a pediatrician? What was the author thinking in that choice?The narrative is yawn-worthy. The sun was shining. The sky was blue. She walked to the elevator and pushed the button. She went to the sixth floor and got off. She went to her office and took off her coat. She worked until ten o'clock.Shifts in point of view from author to characters is clumsy. It's mostly third person narrative and suddenly Jack or Sarah is thinking, in first person. The dialogue is trite and unnatural, as if it's a script and the actors are reading their lines in dress rehearsal. When Jack and Sarah are together, the dialogue slips into the stuff of romance novels. Sometimes they sound like teenagers."
3,Not as good as her others,"Ellen Gilchrist's humor has always been my favorite element of her writing. Her characters are audacious and pathetic, but always funny. Sarah Conley is a little too impenetrable. She doesn't seem to really care about anyone- her son, her lover, or her old flame, but Gilchrist seems to want us to believe that she does. This depiction of a career-focused woman lacks the feeling of Gilchrist's other characters. Sarah's broad statements about life's travails seem trite and you end up wanting Jack to find someone else who will be able to give a little, not just take...I don't think Gilchrist succeeded in portraying the character she was hoping to depict."
1,Not worth your time,"Possibly the worst book written. Sarah Conley had absolutely no character development as she acted on her primal instincts which depicted her true character: back-stabbing, selfish, and arrogant. The only character who seemed to care for her, Robert, was ultimately shafted and eventually forgotten. Sarah Conley epitomizes the stereotype that women always make the wrong decisions.I think I actually lost brain cells reading this ""book."""
1,Where's a good editor when you need one?,"Does Ms. Gilchrist no longer require an editor? If she had one, this novel might not have made it to press -- unless it was at Harlequin. Unfortunately, lack of censure has unleashed a piece of sub-standard work from an otherwise talented writer. It's a real let-down for Gilchrist fans. The story begins well, with the young Sarah but quickly falls to shreds as soon as we meet the adult Sarah-- someone I would not care to know or read about. The story becomes melodramatic with plastic characters and trite dialogue. I began to wonder if Ms. Gilchrist was trying to drag us into her midlife crisis. No thanks. It's such a shame because her earlier short fiction was beautiful, lyrical and funny with a cast of rich characters and intriguing plot-lines. Perhaps the genre is the problem. Short stories and novels are two entirely different beasts...Gilchrist should stick to what she does best."
1,A waste of time,"With its cheesy dialogue and unconvincing characters, I couldn't even finish this book. Ellen Gilchrist needs to spend more time observing human nature and listening to real-life conversations if she wants to write well.The really bizarre thing about this book is that she doesn't tell you when it takes place. In the first chapter, the protagonist is 14. In a later chapter, 1996, she has a 32-year-old boyfriend. Because the boyfriend is ""younger,"" I assumed she was in her late thirties. Many chapters later, I discovered that she was in her fifties. Suddenly her fear of pregnancy as a college student made sense, but why didn't the writer make that clear in the first place?"
2,unlikable main character,"This book was awful. I could not find any redeeming or likable qualities in Sarah. Snobby, self-centered, and worst of all, boring. The plot could not possibly have been more blah. Not even good beach reading."
2,Flimsy light with bad connector,"I purchased one of these in lights in October 2006, and commuted with it for 13 months. At that point I began to get an intermittent connection in the waterproof battery connector, which snaps together very tightly and was always difficult to get together. My previous HID Light, a Cateye Stadium 3, lasted five years, so I was very disappointed in this one. I agree with the other reviewers that it works very well when new. However I wouldn't recommend buying a light that that is so poorly engineered. I've seen other reviewers elsewhere on the web that had the same problem: failure shortly after the warranty expires."
5,Morning Glory (WOW),"I met Gloria about four years ago, in Roswell, New Mexico at the UFO Museum. She was having a book signing, found her and her book interesting. Went to a lecture that night with my friend and about 100 other people. She talked for two hours and you could have heard a pin drop. She is the most sincere speaker. Be prepared to stay up late reading Morning Glory."
5,Fantastic,"A ferocious album marking yet another WR era, one far removed from their early days and moving beyond their flush with popularity of the Heavy Weather days. Swinging, inventive, with blistering work and grooves, beautiful tunes. Zawinul techno overkill on Rockin in rhythm, but it's kinda funny. My cd doesn't sound as good as the vinyl did, but maybe they'll remaster it someday."
4,The last good WR record.,"This is the height of the Zawinul/Shorter/Jaco/Erskine era, along with the live '8:30'. Wonderful production, playing their collective brains out, this is a perfect example of what real players sound like doing ""fusion""."
2,Virtuosic but uncreative,"Jazz fans must have been thrilled when Weather Report left the studio experiments of Mr. Gone behind. Unfortunately, Night Passage doesn't really go anywhere. There's some cool improvisation (this was the jazziest WR album since I Sing the Body Electric) but the compositions themselves are mostly generic fusion. Wayne Shorter only contributes ""Port of Entry"", a sort of ""Elegant People""-lite but easily the best tune on here. (Shorter also plays a lot of great tenor saxophone on this album.) Jaco Pastorius offers ""Three Views of a Secret"" and the band does a really cheesy cover of Ellington's ""Rockin' in Rhythm"". Zawinul does the rest of the songwriting and with the exception of ""Fast City"", it's unremarkable. Those who are interested in the chops of Peter Erskine and Jaco Pastorius will like the album but others may just be bored.[This review is based on the 1990 CD version; I do not know if the 2008 reissue has better sound quality, but the two have an identical tracklist.]"
3,Weather Report in decline,"This effort only shows how much W.R. had slipped from it's Black Market, 8:30, Heavy Weather, Mr Gone period. Night Passage is the beginning of the end. It seems that Zawinul became the ultimate control freak to the detriment of the band. 3 stars at best and only because of Jaco's brilliance did I not rate it a 1 star."
2,Out of ideas,"It's shocking how quickly Weather Report ran out of ideas. ""Weather Report"" and ""I Sing the Body Electric"" were rough but interesting, and then they put out two wonderful albums, ""Sweetnighter"" and ""Mysterious Traveler"" Immediately after that, the stream dried up. Jaco Pastorius is one of the major culprits. His bass playing is technically brilliant, but devoid of ideas. ""Night Passage"" is mostly aimless soloing over uninteresting tunes and arrangements. I think I've listened to it three times, and I can't imagine why I'd listen to it a fourth."
3,all right collection,Bought this collection for Force Five movie could of picked better B movie martial arts movies to go with such as Firecracker. Bruce Lee on cover is a just for art the movie they use isn't worth the extra money. (The real Bruce Lee) please. Poor movie selections.
2,Hard to get past,"Seton's justification and explanation for humans eating meat on page 54 is pathetically insulated in its logic. At that point I saw the limitations of the author's sensibilities and worldview and could no longer enjoy the book. She likens a human's choice to butcher and eat a mammal to an alligator's method of capturing and eating its prey. Ms. Seton, humans have a choice; an alligator does not. Humans can empathize with sentient creatures; alligators can not. It's very rare that I don't finish a book--this was one of those times."
2,"Not much Tai chi, none of it drunken","The only tai chi in the whole movie --toward the end-- is well presented, but the attempts at humor are fairly simple-minded and even infantile (fart jokes, fat jokes, etc.) The hero's uncle sports Jerry Lewis-style fake buck teeth, and there are a couple of brief break-dance episodes. Fans of Hong Kong movies would be better served checking out Shaolin Temple 1, Master Killer or Invincible Pole Fighter."
4,showcase for the Yuen Clan to do some nice work.,"Donnie Yen is great in this movie, but the Yuen Brothers give this movie a boost. The comedy served no purpose what so ever."
2,Not a very relaxing cd,"I was looking for some music for my massage room and had previously loved NatureQuest's After The Rain cd, so I thought I'd try them again. This was not the cd for that job. In addition, one of the tracks sounded like it was from the soundtrack to a zombie movie, even my (fortunately good-humored) client agreed with me."
5,A Primer for New Lawyers,"The book is a must read for future lawyers, particularly criminal defense attorneys. It fills a void for anyone wanting to learn more about the American criminal justice system.""Insightful"" ""Easy to read"" Can be read all at once or as 12 separate cases. Highly recommended for future law students."
2,Inaccurate,"Myths vary by culture, even by adherent, yet there are always general characteristics common to every popular belief system, most of which are well-known by experts. Forty, however, is either ignorant of, or else ignores this, as evidenced by too many entries wherein he presents either unsupported suppositions as unquestioned truth (ie, Gimbutas' old ""peaceful East European matriarchy was destroyed by evil male-dominated Proto-Indo-Europeans"" notion), or out and out misstatements (referring to Papa Legba of Voudoun as being a ""sun god"", where in fact, according to EVERY OTHER SOURCE I've examined, he is instead the ""Opener of Ways"", a sort of metaphysical key to the world of the gods). Since I noted these two and a few other errors, I thus find myself questioning his statements on other gods and concepts with which I am less familiar. In fact, the only reason I didn't give this one star is that some of the pictures are excellent."
1,Boring!,"This book bored me to tears. That I made it all the way through it is a testament to my will power, I guess. But then again, life is really too short to read boring books. If your tastes run to over wrought purple prose and sappy pop philosophy of the Rod McKuen sort, then you mght like this book. Otherwise, forget it."
3,"Well written, just not for my age group (YA)","It's a pretty good book so far, but I felt like an older lady would have enjoyed it much better :)"
2,Too Much Information,"This was one of the most confusing books I've read lately. There were too many characters to keep track of and too many stories within the story going on. The book held no ""special"" theme. It was very typical in the scope of a soap opera in book form. I am at a place where if the book fails to hold my interest before midway through, I am ""through"" with it."
2,Didn't make the connection,"After reading Departures, I thought this book would be funny and interesting. Instead, I found it confusing, annoying and just all over the place. I read Departures years ago and after all this time, I had forgotten the character's details and stories. I shouldn't need to re-read the first book to catch up to the second. I think the author could've done a better job of refreshing my memory. I also found many of the stories (Purdy's for one) to be so farfetched that I had to take a break before continuing. I would like to continue supporting the author, but I thought some of the loose ends could've been tied up better and there were too many characters and stories in this particular book."
3,A nice kids book,"If you are looking for some books for your young one to read and learn from ""The Best Book of Sharks"" is a nice start. Since it is directed to kids the detail level is minimal. If your kids like fish this book will have them asking questions.This is a nice book for parents to read to their kids, while they look at the pictures"
2,the best boo of sharks review,I was looking for a book with information on the sharks and pictures. The book had very small pictures of sharks and limited information and went more into divers and their safety. Not the best book of sharks.
5,Great purchase,"I bought thus for my 5 year old and am very pleased with this book. The information is complex enough to hold his attention, but not so complex that it is overwhelming for him. He loves reading and rereading the pages."
3,Liked it,I got this for my son for Christmas. He liked it - especially the quick facts that he can ask us if we know the answers. He's a budding trivia fan.
1,This book appears to be a hastily made attempt at profit,This book is an embarrassment and of little help to anyone on either side of the proverbial coach. Tragic that it may be the only book written on the subject of APD.
3,Nicer Dicer is Nicer,Loved this-saw on infomercial. Thought worth a try. Like the concept and truly does cut my chopping town by 15 minutes. Not a great cook mind you but I am certainly a more willing cook when you can cut out time and stop myself from cutting myself. Still have to slice potatoes into rounds before putting in the slicer but I otherwise love it. Do get the newer one with the redesigned Lever as it does take a little arm strenghth to cut through it. Overall a great timesaving invention. Oh and totally dishwasher safe. Easy!
5,Best dicer ever.,"This is Genius. I love it. Now my son wants one, since we both make our own salsa in the summer and fall. Dices those onions in a snap!"
1,Blades broke dicing a quarter of an onion!,We were very excited about purchasing our Nicer Dicer but gutted that it BROKE on the second use. The blades bent and came out of shape just chopping small pieces of onion. A real disappointment.
3,Not bad,"Works great cutting potatos into french fries and chopping onions into tiny pieces. Horrible with tomatoes; it doesn't cut through the peel well at all and left my counter soaked with juice. Worked well on apples. You have to cut the pieces small enough to fit under the blade, and by then you might as well keep cutting it with the knife. I bought it to save time during ""taco night"" but found it to get in the way more than anything and ended up tossing it aside while I chopped the rest by hand. If you only want it for potatos and onions then it's worth it. Other than that, don't waste your time or money."
1,Nicer Dicer,"This was the WORST kitchen ""gadget"" I have purchased. The blades were not sharp enough to cut and all I got when I tried to cut was a smashed up blob! I would have given it a -0 rating in I could. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Malfunctioned after a few uses,"This is great for cutting potatoes. However, I use onions in several meals a week, and after only a few uses, one of the blades started coming loose, bending, and cutting into the plastic cutting board below. I was no longer able to effectively use my Nicer Dicer.However, the booklet says it has a 5 year warrantee. So I sent it back to the company.WARNING - if you do not buy the Nicer Dicer directly from the Nicer Dicer company, they will NOT honor the warrantee.The quality of the product does not match the price! Buyer Beware!"
2,Front Pads pictured - rear pads shipped,"It is possible that the part number is incorrect for this pad. DP21441 is on the box (and also D876) and it says ""Rear"" and that is what is in the box."
3,"Tried to finish this book , but couldn't","The premise of the story involving Erevis Cale is a good one. However, after reading the scenes involving some the creatures and their ""deeds"" made me feel sick to my stomach as well as depressed. I hope Erevis is sucessful in his fight to right the wrongs, I just don't have to stomach to see this one through."
2,not my idea of splendor,"Judging from the title this should be quite a special treat. Instead it is a dreary monotonous compilation of songs with a few numbers for the theorbo which seem to drag on endlessly. Johannette Zomer has apparently done a lot of good work and the 29-second snippets of her disc with Fred Jacobs sound warm and quite appealing. By comparison with music from this period by some of the same composers, a disc called ""Nobil Donna, Musique au Palais des Barberini"", Suzi Le Blanc chose a lively mix of numbers which are a joy to hear."
2,Returned...And good riddance!,"I did not care for this card at all. Of the two games I tried (Myst 4 & HalfLife), both had rendering problems. Myst 4 was rendered awful, the sky would break up, and there was a certain point in the game that didn't render a certain puzzle properly. I was stuck until I bought another card! Half-Life looked terrible too, as any player model was rendered as silvery/white, and my on screen stats would be blurred over so I couldn't see them.I tried every nVidia driver out there, without success. Also, I couldn't use older drivers because they would crash Windows XP with a blue screen of death when I booted up. I'm returning this card and paying a few more dollars for the GeForce FX 5200."
1,THE WORST CARD YOU'LL EVER BUY,"I am actually quite apalled with this product. After buying it a year ago because it was pretty cheap, No more than 4 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE, I purchased a Silent Hill game, and the graphics card was NOT compatible. I thought to myself, ""fine..maybe it's just this one game"", But the more games I would purchase, the more those games wouldn't work...I've also found out that the geforce mx 4 SERIES is basically *similiar* to geforce 2! Geforce 3 is actually higher and way more compatible with 3d games--which makes NO sense!!! You'd think geforce 4 (since it's supposed to be an upgrade from geforce 3) would be better..Not in this case.I'm being honest here, some games work.. But if you're looking for the newer, exciting 3D games..(For instance, Silent Hill games, Godfather, etc..) this card isn't for you.If you want to have some great smooth gameplay & gorgeous graphics--save up and buy a graphics card that is WORTH it. Because in my opinion, this one certainly isn't."
1,Awfull... Awfull!,this card simply sucks... do not buy it. yea yea installation was okay but graphics sucked so bad. i tried to run 2002 jurassic park operation genesis and well.. it did worse than my previous S3 Unichrome 32MB card. and two weeks ago the card stopped functioning for no reason.a week ago i ordered MSI Radeon 9250 and omg this is the cheapest and the best card ever.nfs2 along with others run smoooothly.. only game i didnt get to work was Driv3r but that game requires much more.overall go and buy yourself Radeon. do yourself a favor and avoid this card at all costs.i bought MSI Radeon 9250 with 128-MB DDRAM for just 35$ and encourage you to do the same.
5,NOT HAPPY,"I was not happy with the product arriving after Christmas since it was a gift for my son and I also paid for faster delivery which I didn't recieve a refund for, I was also promised a 20% discount on the item which I have yet to recieve. I'm happy with the item but certainly not the service."
5,What a great voice!,Jeff larson has one of the most pleasant and interesting pop voices around. He writes good songs. All of his work is worth having.
1,AVOID - PIECE OF JUNK,It must be the rep from the manufacturer that gave it a 5 star. It is a piece of junk pure and simple. I know because I tried to use it. I will give it zero star.
3,broke the second week,"two wires broked the second week i had this i bought this to use at work,maybe around the house it might be alright but for everyday use i would not use it at a restraunt bussiness cause it will not hold up"
1,pedrini egg slicer,Broke 4th time I used it to slice a hardboiled egg!Too expensive fo rsuch a short life span! My metal one is still working and looks great(12 yrs old) but I gave it to my grandson!
1,egg slicer disappointment,"Arrived in pieces within original packaging. Concealed interior spaces difficult to sanitize. Difficult to open, no finger hole. Compares well to the 99 cent egg slicer at the Dollar Store."
4,egg slicer,This was a free gift for ordering ...I appreciate the gift but just havent had the opportunity to try it yet..although it looks like it will hold up well and perform just fine..txs
1,BORING!,"This is, without a doubt, the most boring egg slicer that I have ever used. It was so bland and uninteresting that I can't recommend it to anyone."
4,Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde,"Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde is Ted Hinton's account describing the early years and the facts leading up to the bloody end of two desparate criminals. Hinton speaks out as one of the six men who killed Bonnie and Clyde in a hailstorm of bullets without warning on the morning of May 23, 1934 near Gibsland, Louisiana. This book is well illustrated and provides several rare pictures. I recommend this book to readers."
4,Trim Kit,The trim kit was easy to install and provides a fresh look to the shower. Hope it holds up better than the previous trim.
2,Would have liked it if it fit,"We were desperate to replace our old Moen faucet without ripping out the wall to replace the valve, so took a gamble, since there aren't a ton of valve options. hey, maybe it would work.Didn't.On the advice of someone else on here, purchased a valve adapter, which looks like a cookie cutter, but fits around the old valve so the new one slides in on top.Still didn't fit - wiggled around.We gave up. Amazon took everything back with no problems and credited us. I guess we will just have to wait until we get enough money and patience to do a full remodel!"
4,great,"Got them for Christmas and installed them last week. For the money they add some nice high freq.Though not audiophile quality, they are a great add on to a stock stereo."
1,OMG,"I recieved the items in a timely manner, however one of the tweeters didn't work. I was unable to return them because my wife threw away the original packaging required for return."
4,Solid Performer,"Good looking silicone whisk. Much more solid and stable than a lot of other ones I have seen. So that pretty much makes it worth the price of admission right there.The handle is large and fits in the palm of your hands nicely, but if you have small hands I would think you would have issue holding this thing. The handle is large, and heavy. If you place it in a shallow bowl it will tip out in the way of the handle. Yup, unlike most whisks it is handle heavy.To me that is a design flaw. I can live with it I guess because unlike other silicone whisks, this one actually works rather well."
2,Too flimsy to be a multi-purpose whisk,"I love most of the Le Creuset products I have purchased with the exception of this whisk! It is too flimsy to be really functional for most items that I whisk with the exception of making gravey in a Le Creuset pan where one would be cautious about scratching the interior finish of the pot. This whisk does not handle heavy batters such as pancake batter well, as it is too flexible. I do love the color however, it matches my small 3 quart dutch oven (which I love by the way)!"
3,contour gauge review,"This is a helpful device, but the one thing that needs to be improved on is to make the metal out of some material that resists rust better. Those of us who live in humid areas of the country would appreciate that more.All said, this is a great gauge for transfering contours from one form to another."
3,stiff when new,The gauge I received works for flat contours. I tried it for shaping the feet of a new bridge to a violin and found that the fingers were too stiff to give a good enough pattern to make it worthwhile for that application. There are better ways to shape a violin bridge.
3,trammel points,"the trammel points worked fine for drawing some bigger over 14"" circles I needed fora woodworking project. The threads on one point were too rough to tighten and looseneasily so I made that the end for my steel point. The other end I was able to makework for my lead to draw circles. These are not a really precision set, but for theprice you get what you pay for. This is OK for someone who will not be using it alot."
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE OF THE PACKGING,"I don't know what to say. I am a stage carpenter and have been for 10 years. When I received the set, I looked at the two points and started to scratch my head.The pieces thread apart and I thought. ""Why?"" WTF? There is no way that even a math teacher can use these to draw circles. There is just no way these trammel points are usable."
2,terrible design for workingman tool box,"well they dont come with extra points and dont fit pencil lead so WHY are the collets not tight?!? i then had the top part fall off from unscrewing in my toolbox. I thought thses would be great as i could use stainless steel 1/2"" or 3/4"" banding for my beam as you dont find wood 3/4""by 1 1/4"" laying around that often, and a carryig a wood beam around on a contruction site is not feasabel and would get broken in toolbox. the odd part it that its beveled on one side and not other so i would have to cut into it with a hacksaw to hold that 22 ga. banding. oh..does anyone have a 24"" compound square? otherwise..dividers would be alot easier. they dont open wide enough for a rule. If you were in a shop and had small steel bar could work out, but in that case i would get starretts or stanleys that have more surface area"
3,Doesn't fit most 12 inch or longer rulers,"First of all it's hard to find a 12 or longer ruler that's less than the advertised 1-1/8"" maximum width. Most seem to be 1-3/16ths or 1-1/4 wide.Second, only a thin 1-1/8"" ruler will work because the beveled slot where the ruler fits is tapered.The trammel points wouldn't slide onto my 18"" Westcott ruler that's 1-3/16' wide. I used a hacksaw to open up the beveled slots. A triangle-file should also work.Before ordering, find a thin ruler that's less than 1-1/8"" wide or be prepared to do some hacksawing. (With a ruler less than 1"" wide, thickness isn't critical.)"
3,Humm.,Just like the other reviews sayed it's kinda cheaply made but it will get the job done. Has some nice features but needs to be refined.
5,"Fascinating real-life mystery, solved",If you're interested in literary mysteries - a real-life scholastic conundrum - this is the book for you. I was fascinated.
4,I AM 15,I am 15.But I atill LOVE fairy tales.The orignely story of ROSE RED and SNOW WHITE is one of my faviourtes.But it was retoled by Patrica and I liked that book much better.
4,Another gem by McConnell,"Another well-written, insightful book by Steve McConnell. It makes the case for not only process, but also for a more professional attitude by programmers and the industry in general. Some of his points will be familiar to those who have read his other books, like Software Project Survival Guide, or his columns in IEEE Software. The book offers a good look at where the software industry is headed from somebody who knows."
2,readable but forgetable,"This very short book summarizes software engineering concepts that we have all heard elsewhere, although the author does an excellent job of presenting it in a readable form.My biggest complaint is that the author's usual audience (the programmers) will read this rather than upper management, the people who really need to understand this stuff. McConnell has established himself as a technical, not a business expert. Maybe he should partner up with someone like Tom Peters to write a book titled ""A Passion for Excellent Software"" because then upper management would read it and think about. This book is essentially preaching to the converted."
4,Encouraging Better Practices,"Steve McConnell writes great books, and this one is another winner, advocating true and needed professionalism in software development. The thing I liked most about this book was its uplifting and encouraging examples; that there are people and organisations out there that are actually putting good methods into practice and seeing such great results."
1,Ewwwww!!!,Very durable but once you use it for a few weaks it breaks! I was using it and I launched my blade and it didn't launch. I was very dissapointed. When I looked at the part of the launcher that you put your BeyB. on it was bent after the 10th to the 30th launch! If you want a very durable launcher thay won't break easily DON'T BUY THIS ONE.It's not even worth the price!
3,Disappointed,"This is really a very good song, but I bought this CD Single because I wanted the ""Almighty Mix"", but all it has its the ""Almighty Mix Radio Edit"". Big disappointment, since the information doesn't say its the ""Radio Edit"". Still, 3 stars because it's not expensive."
1,Don't buy it unseen,"This book was very disappointing. It's not at all what I expected -- though other reviewers did warn that many of the pictures are just plain goofy, and this is true. There are maybe a handful of sexy images but as a whole the book is just an eyesore. I flipped through it once and immediately packed it back up for a refund.The moral I draw from this is: don't buy a book like this online. Go to a bookstore where you can flip through it before buying. If I had done that, I would have saved myself the cost of the return shipping, and perhaps found a better book."
3,Good read-aloud book,"With the repetition of sounds -- the thump, thump, thump of galloping giraffes; the tromp, tromp, tromp of trotting warthogs; the croak, croak, croak of calling frogs; and the adorable beeeeyo, beeeeyo, beeeeyo calls of the baby crocodiles -- this book begs to be read aloud. For a good storyteller, there is a lot to work with. It's truly fun to read with the frequent animal noises happening on every page.Sadly, I can't say the same for the story itself. It's rather bland. The suspense is contrived. Development of the plot gets lost in the author's attempt to slide in bits of information about the crocodile. The main point, the reason the Crocodile Listens, that she is listening for her babies to hatch, takes a minor role.Even with all the fun noises, neither of my crocodile-interested boys (4 & 2.5), ask for this book much. They *do* enjoy the noises and, oddly enough, remark every time on the croc being a Nile crocodile. Beyond that, their interest wanes."
3,Not as expected,"Shipment arrived in time and in good condition, but the CD does not real carry his best songs.The Live atmosphere does not real satisfy as i know it from other Singers or Bands."
1,julio iglesias In Concert (live),"enviarme los dos cd's de julio iglesias, mediante orden de pago al recibir el producto, por la vía de transporte más rapida que se encuentre en disposicion"
5,Message understood,This is a hip hop album in its own category! The lyrics that Common spits are phnominal and have an in-depth message. I think that many other rappers in the industry can learn a line or two from him!
1,Introduction to Elementary Particles,"When I purchased this book I thought I was going to be getting the 2nd edition, which was what I needed for my class, but I was unpleasantly surprised to find that it was the first edition. Looking back, there isn't anywhere that even said the edition on amazon, so that should definitely be looked at."
1,You might like it if you know nothing about the actual 40k fluff,"Blows my mind how people can give this pile of crap a good review. Well, I take that back. The only people I can see who might like this book are those who know very little about the warhammer universe. If you did you would see the vast array of mistakes and screw ups that the author makes.SLIGHT SPOILER-----------So basically the main character eventually becomes a half spider monstrosity, all the while thinking that he still follows the emperor. The chapter master confronts him of his various screw ups, mutations, and heretical actions, and what do they do? One on one fight to the death. Yeah okay. During the fight the spider legs just pop our and replace his legs and half the chapter turn traitor and follow along, still thinking that all is well and good after a very obviously mutated space marines just killed their chapter master.It's not C.S. Goto backflipping termy multilasers everywhere bad, but it's sure trying to be."
4,Good collection of W40K novels,"First reason to buy is the three-in-one novel collection that seems to be very prevalent for W40K books.Second reason is the amount of action that is entailed in the stories. Space Marines are always seen as being at the front lines never far from the action. In the Soul Drinkers Omnibus, this is primarily the case. I say primarily because there are some real dips in the action provided in the book where you begin to wonder what happened. They seem to go from imminent death to hanging out in empty space is a flash, which for me was a real buzz-kill on what could have been some really exciting moments.But don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of action available. And overall I found the collection to be an enjoyable read, I just wish that Counter had actually told more of the stories instead of just teasing us with them."
3,Good book for the 40K fan,"If you like 40K, you'll like this book- if you are not a fan- there are many better books to start with."
1,Discerning 40K fans beware,"I will admit to being entertained to a certain point, but beyond that I could not make myself go on. If you don't know 40K or are one of the millions out there that just enjoys turning your brain off for entertainment, then this book is for you. See LTSE's review for further details. I agree 100%."
2,Limited Nudity,"Its everything you would expect from a Troma film, minus the senseless violence. Most of the nudity is far from the camera in the background. Theres a good full frontal scene that earned the movie an extra star. Its totaly corny... to the point it is funny. Coulda been way more skin in it."
1,great music but dreadful sound,I bought this album after reading glowing reviews here. I already had some idea of the sweet charming music and badly wanted a recording. But the sound quality is probably the worst I have ever heard on an opera album. Recorded live in Mexico in 1949 the sound is like recordings from 20 years earlier. I find it almost impossible to listen. Mignon was recently performed live in New York City which means someone is interested in reviving it. I'd advise waiting for a new album no matter how desperate you are.
1,Poorest sound quality ever,"I myself sang in the chorus of this opera in New York City recently, and just wanna keep a CD recording for myself. After weeks of delay I finally got this CD, but it was so disappointing. The sound quality of the recording was the poorest I've ever heard. It could be worse than anything you could hear through a radio station when you are in the middle of a desert. And through the poor sound quality, somehow the lyrics didn't sound like French to me. Sorry, it is too unclear and I totally don't know what's going on."
1,Completely Disappointing...,"I understand that an author needs to attempt to keep a character within the bounds of the original creators, but I am sorry. Simon Molinar, one of the ""protagonists,"" was quite possibly the most despicable characters that I have ever read about. And I have read about many villains and heroes, not just cookie cutter stuff either. In fact, just thinking about him disgusts me. But this fact is not the reason that I was so let down. What really irked me was that the author almost seemed to want to say to the reader, ""Wow, isn't Simon awesome!"" The book nevers says this, but just something about the way the author describes the horrible actions of Simon makes me wonder. Terrible, just terrible."
3,Good service but more used than I expected,"The book arrived quickly, but was more used than I had expected from the description. There is some bending in the cover and quite a large amount of highlighting throughout the book."
4,great,This slip is what it says it is. seems like it's good quality-I've worn it a few times. good length. I got the 16 inch black slip and i think I'm going to get a white one too.
5,Enlightening!,"This book was given to me following the birth of my first child. At first I could not see the relevance, but soon thanked my wise friend. This book was of tremendous value to me as I developed my new identity and began to reprioritize my life. I was inspired to declutter my life -- not just of physical possessions but also of the trivial matters that I often allowed to irritate me. I have since given the book as a gift on many occasions. I've added the book to my ""library"" of other comfort readings: the entire Chicken Soup series, The Moral Compass and various devotionals-- specifically those of Stormie O'Martian."
3,Beware! Not for pagans or other non-Christians.,"This is a Christian book, so be prepared to have the Bible quoted at you and used to justify everything said. The concept may be OK, but why does the author have to Christian-ize everything and make everything revolve around the Christian God (and Jesus)?! Us pagans and Buddhists get really annoyed by this, and in my case I couldn't get past it. If you're Christian, I'm sure you'll love it."
2,It wasn't quite what I'd hope....,"I have been interested in simpliflying my life for a while now but most of the books are written by secular writers. So when I saw this I was interested but as I said it wasn't what I hoped it would be. To much personal stories and not enough how to's.A better book for book for how to's is simple living by janet Luhrs, although it is not written from a christian perspective either."
2,A magnet next to your brain.,"I regret buying these headphones. My previous ones where Panasonic and I was very satisfied. I discovered however that these ones have a magnet inside them that can easily lift a paper clip or two! Well, I am not a doctor but I do not like having a magnet next to my brain all the time. I checked and my previous ones (RP-HS45) could not attract the paper clip so I guess they do not have such strong magnet. In addition the behind the neck cable in these headphones (the RP-HS 102) is not comfortable at all for me since the cable always ends up twisted and it ticklish my neck. I will look for Panasonic headphones but not this model. 2 stars just for the high sound-quality, design and brand."
2,Not a very good Wood book,"Virtually all of Audrey Wood's books are really good (especially the one's illustrated by her husband Don), but not this one. This book was just ok."
3,Whit or what?,I read this book over the last week and found it very interesting and intelllectually stimulating. Unfortunately I really didn't understand more than 50% of what he wrote as he uses lots of big words that I couldn't understand.
3,Blah,"Not one of his better books, in my opinion. Perhaps it's all a Scottish/British/European in-joke, but the whole book just seemed aimless and meandering. At least Song of Stone had its surreal and dreamy language."
1,Boring,"Having thoroughly enjoyed previous Banks' books this is a real disappointment. I'm glad that I read a library copy and didn't spend money on such a piece of mundanity. The story is told from the angle of someone unexposed to normal society nad since we are, it really is boring to read her account of it. There are no surprises, nothing worth waiting for. A very sub-average book and just too banal for Banks' usual style. Enjoyed Complicity, Wasp Factory, Bridge. Couldn't stand this one and Crow Road."
5,1 of his 2 best,"I am a long standing fan and have many of his albums. If you only get 2, get this one and Stardust. They are both beyond excellent."
1,it's a pity...,"I received the wrong item and returned it back. However, I can't put the reorder on the original item because of the size is run out! it's a pity..."
3,banned in boston; memoirs of a stripper,GREAT BOOK BUT SHE DID NOT SHARE MUCH OF HER FAMILY LIFE WITH THE HUSBAND SHE LEFT BECAUSE OF AN UNHAPPY and ABUSIVE MARRIAGE. THAT WOULD HAVE ADDED MORE INTEREST TO THE STORY LINE. DID HER BEING A FORMER STRIPPER HAVE AN AFFECT ON HER MARRIAGE OR WAS SHE JUST UNHAPPY WITH HIM AS A PERSON. WE NEED ANOTHER FOLLOW-UP OF THE STORY. ANOTHER BOOK PLEASE.
5,Redskins Rule!,Excellent T-shirt good quality as you'd expect from this company. Show your 'skins allegiance with pride and it's cool to wear something other than burgundy for a change
3,Poor Packaging,"The competency of this product was compromised due to dents in the frame. The dents were caused by a poorly packaged item, that most likely occurred while in shipment. An email sent to the vendor was left unanswered. Due to the dents, a firm seal is not doable. The filter, itself, was intact."
5,Saves money,Did my research and I think this should save a lot of money over its lifetime. It will also keep a lot of waste out of the landfill.
4,Good text for an undergrad class,"A very hands-on, applied bent to this book. Designed explicitly to cater to engineering undergraduates, it forsakes strict mathematical rigour for what is more useful to engineers. Namely, there is emphasis on numerous examples, that are fully described. So much so that they may be considered case studies.The theme is one of a pragmatic approach to using statistics in an engineering context. Many algorithms are not presented as actual code in some computer language, but as pseudocode. This may be of use to an instructor wondering whether to use this book or not. The pseudocode readily lends itself to assignment problems where the student has to implement it in some actual source code. This has a moderate level of difficulty, and would be reasonable problems to assign. Each should not take more than a few hours (3?), assuming that the student is already competent in a computer language."
5,Lockers open,"If you want to know what really happens to a 16 year old teenager, this is the book to read. Ophir finds lust, love, betrayal, and tragedy all in a space of few months. This is a great book. If you happen to love this book, which i know you will, read Jester's Down, by Donche. The two books compliment each other."
3,Off the chain,"This book kept it real. It was was about ordinary people with ordinary struggles. Sonja didn't know she had a good man in the beginning and then marries a helliun.This book was really good from beginning to end. It has a few editing issues, but besides that it is off the hook. I would like to see a sequal to this book. The author could definitly make the story line longer next time.I felt as though the characters were alive and I knew them. The dialogue was easy to follow."
4,Great book,"This is a story of a relationship that is supposed to be built on love and trust, but instead built on lies, abuse and manipulation. Sonja finds out her husband Derrick has been having an affair and his mistress is quite possesive. In order to hide out from her husband, Derrick, she runs to her ex-husband Kasey. Kasey still loves Sonja, but remembers he wasnt the one who intiated the divorce. While he is trying to win Sonja back saving her from Derrick, Derrick is trying his hand at keeping his wife...not because he loves her, but he wants what she has."
5,Good,This item came very quickly after purchase. Good price for the product. Would deal with company again whenever i need staples
1,how inspiring...,"One day, someone good Christian, being inspired by what s/he's read, will up and write THIS book: 'Things Christian Leaders Doesn't Want You to Know'"
1,right......,"*rolls eyes in utter disgust* Yes, I think we should write a book entitled 10 Things Jesus Doesn't Want You To Know. And, for that matter, write millions of other books condemning the Xtian god and his followers and put them in the Christian section and see how all the Christians react when they go to their section and search for their ""manuals of light"" and find nothing but books filled with intolerance about their religion... I don't know if it's just me, but when will Xtians realize that most Satanists are amused by this Xtian philosophy of ""are way is the only way."" Heck, I'm writing a review because these Xtian authors are so stupid it's funny!"
2,Buttons small,There are too many things to do before playing a game or checking an entry. The buttons for everything are small and the writing on the instructions is very tiny. I did not like it and gave it away.
4,Satisfied,"The baking pan exactly fits our toaster oven--which was the reason for purchase. I didn't need another low-sided pan or broiling/cooling rack, but occasionally put them to use as a cover for the cake, and a place to cool it after baking.The ware looks like hand washing will be necessary prolong life - no claim was given to be dishwasher-safe."
4,Nice and cleans up great.,I like these items. They bake things evenly and clean up really well. I would recommend them to anyone. Nice items.
1,Eventually no teflon,"I had mine for a couple of years maybe, maybe less and being cautious not to use sharp objects and hand washing, for no apparent reason the teflon started to flake off...not a quality product to last and who wants to injest teflon. It's now a drip pan for my Weber propane grill..."
3,The Best Compact pans but...,"These are the best sized and heavier weight pans for compact counter top ovens, but the finish comes off after several uses. This has been a common complaint, but Nordicware hasn't done anything about it. I continue to use them at my own peril... (is that pepper or pan flakes?)"
3,Size is everything!,Should have payed more attention to the measurements listed. Can't hardly cook a half a box of chicken nuggets on the bakers sheet.
3,Measuremenst not as described.,Received item and the measurements are smaller than described. They are the outside measurements. The inside is much smaller. Had other dealings with this company and they seem to be very disorganized. Poor customer service. Would not buy a Nordic Ware product again.
1,Not the size it says,"Amazon's product review says these are 7 x 10 inch trays. They are not, they are 6 x 8 inches. Obviously much smaller than expected, rather disappointing."
1,Did not fit as I expected,I expected the items to fit and be usable in my Oster 6058 Toaster Oven. All of the items were too small. Why would they advertise these pieces for the Oster 6058 and not fit properly. My wife and I were Extremely disappointed!!
1,Awful!,"Ok, first of all, my set was light gold in color and did not seem to have any nonstick surface to it!The pans are so thin and lightweight that they bend easily. The tray has already warped after the first use. They are soooo cheap looking and feeling. As I was washing the deeper pan, it was bending and popping all over the place. This set is a HUGE disappointment. You might as well just go buy the disposable aluminum foil pans.The rack was inside the deeper pan during shipping and it made scratches and black/grey marks on the pan that did not come off.I saw that people have said the Teflon is coming off of their pans after the first use, but mine do not seem to have any Teflon or any other type of coating. It is like a raw, gritty finish on my set.I do not recommend this set unless you can get it under 5 bucks, you have low expectations, and want a more disposable set."
2,Flaky & easily scratched,"The first time I had to LIGHTLY scrub the rack, pieces of non-stick coating flaked off. The rack scratched the pan it fits in the first time I very carefully put it in. It's as cheaply made as it is inexpensive. Definitely disappointing and not recommended."
2,Should have paid attention to size,"I had thought (assumed) they would be size of toaster oven, not so small they could be used in a child's easy bake oven. But it is my fault, I should not have assumed because they where listed as ""toaster oven ware"" that they would be standard toaster oven size."
3,Toaster oven pans,this set of non-stick toaster oven pans are very nice but are much smaller than I expected
2,Not what I had expected,Although this may be of use for an individual it is not big enought for an entire family or even two people.
2,cheap,"I WAS A BIT DISAPOINTED WITH THE SIZE , WEIGHT , AND FINISH OF THE SET . THE NAME NORDIC WARE , CONJURED UP IMAGES OF TOUGH VIKINGS WITH SHIELDS AND BROAD AXES STORMING A CASTLE . IF THEY HAD TO COOK WITH THESE CHEAP TOOLS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH TO PLAY CAPTURE THE FLAG ."
4,Good size and purpose but hard to clean,"I like these 2 pans, they are used constantly in this house, but I have found the ""baking sheet"" doesn't clean up very well. Otherwise, I do like the sizes."
4,Decent Pans,I bought these pans so that I could use them in my Toaster Oven. They are okay. A little smaller than I was wanting and could use a little bit better non-stick inside them.
1,One of the worst products I've ever purchased,"I don't know why the other reviewers keep saying the ""Teflon is flaking off"". There *is* no Teflon. As far as I can tell, they just spray painted regular pans with black paint. Everything sticks to it. These pans are worthless, save your money."
1,"Not worth the shipping, even if its free","Purchased this set and on the first use the non-stick finish, started peeling off. Not worth buying."
2,"Nonstick comes off easily, but OK for the price I guess...","Mine arrived with some scratches in the nonstick layer on the shallow pan. I haven't used it too heavily, and have only had it for a few months, and already the nonstick coating is coming off the grill rack too. It would also be nice if it had a lip so it could be easily pulled out, because it's difficult to reach under the edge of the shallow pan with a pot-holder to get a grip on it to pull it out. I haven't used the deep pan for anything, just the wire rack over the shallow pan to drain grease (mostly chicken) while baking."
1,cheap!,Very poor teflon quality-flaked from the first time I used them. The weight of the pan and design are nice though; too bad they didn't put a few more cents worth into the teflon coating!
1,Teflon Peeled off,I also used these less than 10x and the teflon peeled off - too bad because this perfect size for a toaster oven.
3,Disappointed but satisfied in New Jersey,"I bought this set for my wife and we used it maybe 3 times and the deep pan started to loose its teflon coating, called Nordicware and they were quick to replace it upon receipt of the old pan. Not one hassle other than you have to pay the shipping to them. Over all I would rate it a great set and do agree that it could use a lip on all of them as it is difficult to grab them with a pot holder."
1,Disappointment,"I felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set. The grill cover started to desapair, and the last time I cooked a stek using this set, the paint sticked to the meat, leaving black spots. It started to show deteriorazion and everytime I washed I have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon.The deep pan it is ok, perhaps because I did not used that piece with the same frequency.I never used metal utensills or harsh detergents durig the cleaning, I always leave it in hot water first and later do the cleaning, to avoid scratches.Thank you for your attentionNilda"
2,Dissapointed in Wwashington!,"I too have a spot missing on the non-stick coating. I only usedit twice and then never used abrasives on it, was just fish cooked with olive oil. Too expensive to have this happen.I bought the kiddies cook set as well and it is great."
2,Not the size stated.,"According to the description this is supposed to be a 10x7 inch set of pans, which it isn't. Interior is 6x8 and with the edge is only 6 1/2 x 9. Either Amazon has messed up or Nordicware has misrepresented the size."
2,It Doesn't Fit,"It's a nice idea though. I bought it to use with my Euro-Pro 4 slice toaster oven to bake and broil in, since I use it moreso than my regular stove and oven. but the Pans are wider than the door to the oven, they won't even go inside except at an angle, which of course makes it useless to me. The rack does fit, but is smaller than the rack that came with the oven so, can't really use that either. I'm either going to have to get a bigger toaster oven or use some of those disposable aluminum loaf and cake pans and see if they'll do the job instead."
2,Horrible bottoms,The pans are eh but the bottoms are so uncomfortable to touch after a few watches..how many more pennies would it really have costed to coat the entire pan?
2,Dimensions,"I would not even think about buying any pans for my toaster oven with out knowing the dimensions, especially the outside dimensions. Why do they never tell the dimensions. I need a cake pan that has no handles and measures 10 x 11.5 inches on the outside. This would be about equal to a 9 x 13 in square inches and would fit in my toaster oven. Why doesn't some company make such a pan?"
5,Nordic Ware baking set - non stick,"The Nordic Ware set for the toaster oven was to replace the trays that came withthe Toaster Oven from Black and Decker - as their parts are so ""thin"" that tryingto clean them they bend and come out of shape. The Nordic Ware pieces are a bitsmall but - heavy duty and clean with a wipe of the damp cloth and do not bend or come out of shape. The price was great and ordering them was simple and fast."
2,you get what you pay for,"the non-stick properties last for one or two uses.the grate/insert is already peeling, and the twopans are less and less non-stick. i should haveknown. (and i should have checked the returndate sooner.)"
5,Handy items.,Produts are the right size for the toaster oven. Easy clean. They will also store without taking up a lot of space.. which is nice
3,well made-- too small,"This set has sturdy construction. Nice conductivity; baked goods seem to brown up adequately. There aren't many broiling pans this small, and it's about right for two hamburger patties or chicken breasts.I bought it for use with my Krups FBC2 Convection oven, and it's disappointingly small. It's generally fine, maybe, for most toaster ovens. But, I'd been searching for a good cookie sheet, and it's not this. I can only fit about two regular-size cookies on the sheet, but with my oven, I should be able to get six. The search continues."
2,Product didn't come yet,"I didn't have this product up to now. I would like to know why. I'm a great Tony Joe White's fanbut I couldn't watch any video about him. the ""expired date"" has been expired."
2,Not Pleased,"No problem with the store that sold this to me but the quality of the product is lacking. The handle seems cheaply made and the top part (above the black rings) fell off after a couple weeks of use. I super glued it back on and it's been alright so far but for about $20, it seems like a rip-off.The handle itself is very small and I hit my fingers on the sides of my mug when I'm mixing up my proraso shaving cream. The entire brush fell from the stand into my sink a short while ago and now there are also cracks on the sides of the handle - it seemed like a lot of damage for such a short drop.The stand is just cheap plastic and while I use it, it just seems silly. I can't just remove the brush from the stand because it's so light. I have to pick up the brush while still on the stand and then remove it.I've used an Omega brush before and didn't have any problems but this one isn't worth it."
2,Appears to be good quality,I ordered this belt to go with a holster I purchased at the same time. I ordered what I thought would be a little large for me and when I received it it was actually too small. I have returned it about 2 months ago an I'm still waiting for the credit to hit my account.The belt did seem to be of good quality and I would have just exchanged it for a larger one but they didn't have any in stock.Still disappointed about the return process. I should have received my credit by now
4,"""Jeffey drank soda wrong so Dave poked Jeffey in chest""","LOL! I wouldn't run out and buy this movie, but I got a few good chuckles out of it. Definitely worth watching."
3,"""Incredible; that guy is the Deion Sanders of retards""","Right from the opening of the movie, I could tell this was going to be far better than Johnny Knoxville's last attempt at acting in ""Daltry Calhoun"".The plot of the movie is ridiculous, which isn't a big deal when dealing with a comedy. Steve Barker (Knoxville) is talked into fixing the special olympics by his Uncle in an attempt to erase debts that both of them have acquired. There are some very funny moments sprinkled throughout the film, with some funny supporting characters. Actually, the supporting actors provide most of the truly funny moments... Knoxville does a solid job with his performance, though, and is fairly funny as Jeffy, the character/persona he takes on when infiltrating the special olympics.I would recommend seeing this movie if you're a fan of slapstick comedy, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."
4,Were're going to Hell for this aren't we?,"That's what I thought when I went to see this with my wife, but we were both so supprised by this movie that we saw it two more times. Yes it has a very basic formula dealing with moral redemption, but it also is very heartwarming and very funny. Sure all the special kids had the best lines, thats what made it work, you could tell every one had a blast making the movie, and that made going to the movie three times worth it. The movie is totally redeeming and uplifting, one of the few movies to make you happy from the begining to the end."
5,This Is A VERY GOOD MOVIE WITH HEART,I really liked this movie and i thought it was not in bad taste.There where plenty of laughs along the way.Keep in mind that this is a comedy!Not a drama!Go and see the movie and find out for yourself.
2,scratches,Halfway through the movie there are scratches and the movie froze up. It continued through the biggest part of the movie
4,Celebrates the disabled & the enabled people aren't so bright.,"I recall the theater groaning when a preview for this came on, myself included. But word of mouth convinced me to see it and it's a good movie. I give the filmmakers credit for treating the disabled respectfully from the get go and not having a movie with one of those miraculous changes of heart for the lead character at the film's end. I think it would have gone over better if Knoxville, who does do a good job, weren't the lead. With his reputation, you'd expect this movie to be as dreadful as it sounds. Had they cast someone else with more of an actors reputation (IE Matt Damon) it would have had a shot but that aside, it's a funny movie that respects the disabled."
5,funny,A movie that will keep you laughing from the first minute till the last. Does not make fun or people they should not they are great actors
2,Johnny Knoxville needs acting lessons....,Short attention span version:- There are some funny parts....few and far between- Very predictable- Acting is terrible- Might make you sleep- I love Johnny Knoxville but his acting was just terribleConclusion:Rent it if you must need a quick and cheap laugh (or maybe 2 cheap laughs) otherwise skip it.2 stars
4,BAD BOY JOHNNY,"Pretending to be mentally challenged and sabotaging the Special Olympics seems like a tasteless premise, doesn't it? Well to the credit of THE RINGER, the movie manages to really appreciate the gifted athletes and show how courage, honesty and love can conquer all. Johnny Knoxville is quite effective as the ""loser"" who fakes being challenged due to needing money and at the urging of his similarly financially strapped Uncle (the delightful Brian Cox). He falls for the lovely camp counselor (Katherine Heigl) and is soon exposed by the other athletes, but they want him to stay to defeat the obnoxious egoistic Jimmy. The movie has some fun moments and the first time actors who are really mentally challenged do a great job. It's a feel good movie that you can enjoy without feeling guilty."
3,"Silly Slapstick Sophomoric Humor, but takes a Touching Turn","The premise of the movie is enough to make you laugh: A man pretends to be mentally retarded so he can compete in the Special Olympics and win $100,000 in bets against the favorite. He needs the money to pay for a friend's surgery and to help his financially hurting uncle.About halfway through the film, the mood changes from silly to somewhat touching, as the protagonist Steve bonds with his MR/DD athletic friends (who want to see him beat the favorite). The friendships have such an effect on him that his conscience begins to get in the way of his financial goals.That, and a beautiful woman named Lynn who is dedicated to helping the MR/DD population.This is not a classic film by any stretch, but it is funny and will entertain you for 90 minutes."
5,the ringer,"it was very funny, I really enjoyed watching it. it was very entertaining and could watch it again. had great actors in it too."
3,Funny,"This movie was really funny and touching at the end. The biggest problem is getting past the fact it is making fun of people with mental disabilities, but in the end comes full circle to celebrate the achievement of those with disabilities."
1,I'd rather watch old people butter toast,"I'm a knoxville fan but I was really disappointed with his performance. I know a lot of people who could play a better retard. ""Denim Dan"" was the only believable character besides the real 'caps'. Maybe I should've have watched the movie on a rocket?"
1,Simply terrible,Wow.. w..o..w! This movie was awful. so incredibly awful I can't even write a review and waste another 2 minutes on this garbage. Thankfully I didn't pay to see it. Avoid it at all cost. This is not Knoxvilles finest moment. Excuse me why I go watch Glitter and Gili to wash the horrible taste from my mouth.
2,"Yeah, this movie isn't that great...","I bought this here movie out of the ""4 for $20"" bin at Blockbuster video. That's righteously where it belongs too.It's not too stimulating to the part of my brain that wants to laugh. It was too soft and cute and too scared to push any buttons. It must be pointed out though that the Farrelly Brothers were only producers of this film. Not writers nor directors. But still, yes, they have lost their edge.It's all good. At least Judd Apotow is bringing the comedic goods nowadays."
3,Good to Watch,"The movie is worth watching once. It does have its moments, but it is not laugh out loud as I thought. You will laugh and you will cringe during Johnny's training scenes, but that is about all. Rent it once and see for yourself. However, I would not recommend buying the movie. I hope this helped!!!"
1,wack Movie,sat through this mess of a film the other night&while it had a couple of ok moments it was truly a mess. the jokes weren't really there&the story just kinda was made up as it went along. not much to this film at all. this film felt like 4-5 movies put together for the sake of formula basic humor. no depth whatsoever.
1,A waste of time not funny at all it's just stupid,I am not saying it's bad becouse they make fun of hanicape peopel i thought they did a good job protraying handicap's and showed them to be nice. The reason this film was bad was for many reason's. the first the acting was bad Johnny Knoxville was dreadfull he's trying to be a good person but he's not and he cant act. Then there's the story which is a waste of time there's no plot and the plot is jsut stupid. Overall a wastre of time there are no laughs at all.
3,not tight enough,"I suppose it was a lot to expect, but the wingnut does not tighten enough to reliably remain at a consistent gap. makes it a bit difficult to rely on. a rubber washer between the major parts might help."
1,Piece of junk,Purchased this based on other reviews and found it to be a total piece of junk. Those others who gave good reviews obviously haven't used good measuring tools before. I couldn't find the compass I have had for 40 years so in a pinch I got this one. It is made of cheap materials and construction to match. Wouldn't hold a pencil or stay adjusted. It is great for making a circle where the starting point and ending point need not match. I'd have had more fun taking the money and throwing it on the ground and watching people pick it up. I think that's what I will do with the compass. I bet most everyone will pick it up and throw it back down recognizing it's a piece of junk.
5,Bar Set,I have been looking for a bar set for a while and was glad to be able to buy this one at such a great price.
5,One Bullet Away,This book should be required reading in secondary schools. It provides a look at the brave endeavors of our nation'smilitary leaders and how they had the 'right stuff' to get themselves there and through their tough deployments inIraq and Afganistan.
5,Extremely Meaningful,"I can honestly say that I learned more about leadership and being an officer from this book than from anywhere else. Fick is easy to relate to, extremely competent and capable, and a superb officer. His ability as a storyteller is unmatched, and he is very introspective, which allows the reader to feel as if they are actually developing, suffering, and learning right along with him. The last few pages of the book will almost move you to tears out of sheer pride for the fact that men like Fick exist. Anything I write here cannot do this book justice; you simply need to read it for yourself. This is a must if you are an aspiring officer."
5,A Fascinating Story from an Exceptional Human Being!!,"My favorite uncle was a highly decorated Marine at Guadal Canal and Okinawa in World War II. This book provides graphic detail that the U.S. Marines are still developing the kind of leaders this country needs to preserve the freedoms that many American's take for granted. Author Nathaniel Fick is now a hero to me, just like my uncle was when I was growing up.This book clarifies some of the foggy communication we received from our government during the early days of the second war in Iraq.Clearly, the U.S. Marine Corps continues to attract and train our very best young people. Semper Fi!. This book is a great read for all Americans, young and old.John Tyler Gibson, Livonia, Mi."
4,It's like getting deep into the reality,"Nice book, easy to read. Feeling like in action when reading. Many details giving you the understanding of what had happened really. For those who want to see the life of the Marines from the inside."
3,"Decent, but not great","I bought this book after reading the first chapter online. In it, he describes the Marine Corps' Officer Candidates' School with unerring accuracy. I've been there, and his descriptions of it are dead-on and bring back many memories. However, I can't remember any of the book past that.For a memoir, I didn't learn much about the author. He went to Dartmouth. Then he went to war. Then he came home. Finally he wrote a book. And what a book it was: it's average. There are books that stand up head-and-shoulders above the rest, like ""Generation Kill"" and ""Jarhead""Say what you will about ""Jarhead"", but the story was compelling and the narrative engrossing. Jarhead's like a secret dish: some like it, some think it's too spicy, etc. ""One Bullet Away"" is more like vanilla ice cream. Filling and good-testing, but it won't stick in your mind. It takes a middle-of-the-road position on just about everything, and the author doesn't seem to have very many opinions about what he did."
5,Stellar,"This is the best written book, especially about the Corps, that I have ever read. It is accurate, realistic, no bull blunt information, yet it is written as a story. Very stellar work. I couldn't put it down, literally. Any time I had some free time, this is what I did, and still do. Being one headed to OCS next summer (hopefully), this is a great read, preparing me for what is to come. As I could see in this book, MCRD is nothing compared to OCS and TBS. He covered OCS and his duty-time more than TBS, but all in all it was the most accurate and amazing book I've ever read, as stated above. If you plan to go to OCS, want to learn about it, or a military/USMC enthusiast, I suggest you get this book. STELLAR!!!!"
5,Bringing to life,"Capt Fick represents his story with honor. As an 2x Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran, and a Marine, I can relate to this book very easily. It is a great read. Anyone in the Corps would be honored to have Capt. Flick at their platoon commander. He brings the situation as it is and was over there to life for the reader. He gives you a exceptionally accurate view of what the front line is like in Iraq. Anyone who reads will feel like they are right there with the Marines. The only way to get even closer is to Enlist in the United States Marine Corps and see it themselves. Semper Fidelis.Corporal Peter ScottUSMC"
3,Not bad at all,"This is a decent memoir, but a bit too crafted for me. Looking at some of the other reviews, it looks like a major circle jerk. Dartmouth this, Harvard that. In the end, who cares? At any rate, I've served and know what good writing is, and there's plenty here. But if your looking for something really raw and from the gut, this is a bit too polished. Much better than Jarhead though, which is terrible."
3,"Not quite, Captain","I'm applying for OCS myself, so I'm going through absolutely as much Marine Corps literature as I can. This book was most valuable for me in its relation of Fick's life before the Corps and during OCS. Somewhere along the way, though, he really just lost my interest. I suppose Fick is an intelligent person, and that comes across in his writing. But the writing doesn't really get beyond that--it seems like an A- paper written by a Dartmouth undergrad. It's just not very compelling--light-years behind a book like Jarhead. So if you are looking for an entertaining book about the Corps, go for Jarhead, but keep in mind that its portrayal of the Marines is rather sour. I could really only recommend this book to aspiring officer candidates, and even then, WARLORD by Ilario Pantano, in my opinion, offers a more candid, gritty, unapologetic and entertaining view of a Marine officer's experience in Iraq."
2,Fell short and dry,"That pretty much sums it up.If anybody ever tried to eat those saltine crackers from an MRE in under a minute without water then this is what this book feels like.#1 I have never met a soldier or a marine without a sense of humor, but it looks like the author is the first exception to this rule.#2 I would consider myself an idealistic ""country and honor"" person but Fick's nonstop textbook propaganda tirades made me roll my eyes through some chapters. His OWN opinion and perception on the events barely show sometimes and it appears that he is scared to show what he really thinks or even say a word thats inappropriate at a family dinner table. Come on, man! Haven't you trained with regular guys, and shat right next to them in the field? Loosen up! This is not a book for kindergarten. You're not in front of your chain of command or giving some motivational speech in front of your platoon."
2,Wait for the Paperback,"It must be the fall because all the Iraq books from part-time soldiers are out in time for school for the college kids and the urban elite to drool over. This is one book of many (My War, I Love my Rifle, This Man's Army) memoirs written way too soon. O'Brien waited 20 years before writing Things He Carried. The reason I come down on this one is that while the others are brash and undisciplined, at least they have a point. One Bullet plays to all audiences without taking a stand. I liked the writing and the opening, but darned if even a single sentence stayed with me a day after putting it down. This book cost $24. It's got all the right reviewers and background. But for anyone who's been in the military, the question will be...""And?"" Wait until it's out on paperback before you blow any cash on this."
3,Not bad,"While I'm tired of memoirs from ivy leauge officers (as if they are making a greater sacrifce than any other sodlier/marine?), this one isn't bad. Come on enlisted guys, get off your ass and write something!"
5,A truth-teller,I couldn't put this book down. It gives a fascinating account of Fick's progression through his career to become a Recon platoon leader. More importantly it shows his development as a combat leader and as a thoughtful professional. Exceptionally well written.
5,Right on the Money,"I am a retired Marine Corps officer, albeit 30 years older than Captain Fick. If you are looking for the truth about the thoughts, feelings, fears, hopes and concerns of a Marine Corps Officer---this book is right on the money. Captain Fick has captured in a very easy to read book, the true feelings of all Marines who fight for their country---and are motivated by selfless concern for their fellow Marines. I admire his ability to capture what he felt and I felt during my service. I guarantee that once you atart to read this book you will not be able to put it down before you have finished it"
5,A nonstop thrill ride that virtually cannot be put down until it is done,"When some people go out of business, they cut their losses. Corinn Michaels is not one of these people. ""The .40 Caliber Mousehunt"" is an exciting action novel from author Stephen Pytak following Corinn Michaels and her elaborate involvement in a contract killing ring that uses the internet to find its clients. When the ring falls to pieces and she's on the run from government agents, she doesn't intend to run forever. ""The .40 Caliber Mousehunt"" is a nonstop thrill ride that virtually cannot be put down until it is done."
3,Bad pencil holder,"This is an excellent tool except for one thing. It is a pain in the ass to put a pencil in this thing.It does however, adjust very easily, very well and precisely. As as machinist, I will have to fabricate a modification to correct this situation."
5,There's a New Heroine in Town...,"... and her name is Kate. This terrific new spin on the old ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" story is fresh and exciting. While the old version was fun, I always felt a little uncomfortable rooting for a protagonist who was a sneaky, shiftless thief. ""Kate"" retains the adventure of the old story with a twist -- instead of committing larceny, our heroine is retrieving stolen property from the giant who swiped them from a poor, starving widow. Best of all, the illustrations are gorgeous, and evocative of the best folk art. Boys and girls alike will welcome the spunky Kate into their pantheon of fairy tale favorites."
3,Same premis as Jack but with a twist at the end.,"Mom gives her daughter, Kate, their only cow to sell at market for food before they starve. Daughter exchanges cow for magic beans and the mother is furious. She throws them out the window and that night a huge beanstalk has grown up to the clouds. Kate climbs up stalk, takes on an adventure, disguises herself to complete her mission successfully and winds up avenging her fathers death. Heroine story good for young girls. Illustrations are decent but all characters have the same face. I liked the idea of the book and love the front cover but the book left me wanting more."
5,We loved it!!!,"An awesome book! I love the feminist retelling of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". My four and a half year old granddaughter loved it, too."
4,Girl heroine in classic fairy tale,"Summary: In this version of the classic tale, a girl climbs to the top of a giant beanstalk, where she uses her quick wits to outsmart a giant and makes her and her mother's fortune.""It's refreshing to read the old magic story with a girl as the central character. Most kids nowadays just accept this and don't think it's unusual."
5,"Looks nice, works well, great price from tigerdirect.","This is a nice looking TV, with good picture quality (assuming good source quality). Have played games on it and watched several action type movies and have seen only one instance of ghosting. This is a smallish TV and best for a bedroom/kitchen type room. A DVI or HDMI connection would have been nice, but at the price they were offering it, it still should get 5 stars."
5,One of the best CDs ever recorded!,"I have heard songs off of this albums since it came out when I was only a school boy. I never putt it together that this was a super-group or even that these songs were on the same album. When I was old enough to put this together it then became impossible to find this recording. Now that I have and I have it, I realize it's even better then the few songs that infected me earlier in life. I love the up-beat rockabilly songs like ""Heart"", ""Teacher, Teacher"", and ""Play That Fast Thing"", but I also love the less rocking numbers as much. Add to all of this the bonus material now available on the CD and ""Seconds of Pleasure"" now translates into hours of pure listening pleasure!"
1,bad service,"cd was supposed to be new, but was obviously used with many scratches, also delivery was slow, price also not fair, very unhappy with order."
4,written and produced by Mack Sennett,"Written and produced by Mack Sennett, the film made ''in 1919, belongs to the tendency of patriotic films. A little later, because in 1919 the war is over. You can see the film as a cartoon against the autocratic political system of Germany. Neither the emperor, his son or the Marshal Hindenburg are not spared by Mack Sennett. A fun movie."
1,Never had much capacity and died!,It only worked for about 3 hours for the first month until it progressively gave out two months later.
1,Sucks,Bought this to replace battery which died..it wouldn't charge much and could hold a charge initially for a few minutes then not at all.. Waste of money.
4,"Good sound, but uncomfortable","I had a little bit of an issue with situating them properly, and when I did, they are a little uncomfortable (possibly because of all of the metal).However, when I plugged it into the laptop, and pressed play on a film I was watching, the sound was excellent. I suppose I can live with the discomfort as i probably won't use them often.******UPDATE 26 august 2012******For the past week these have been giving me this static feedback. Then today, they broke. I have had these for a month. I have bought dollar tree headphones that have lasted longer."
4,Chill Sessions review,"I was introduced to this album through Pandora. I really like this. It's good for driving or just hanging out, listening to good music."
3,A good primer for Ra's al Ghul,This was not what I thought it would be when I ordered it. I found this title on a list of the 25 best Batman graphic novels so I gave it a try. Unlike most other graphic novels which cover an entire story this is a collection of stories with Batman and Ra's al Ghul. So if you are looking for an introduction to Ra's al Ghul vs Batman this is for you but if your looking for a more detailed story skip over this one. Some of the stories were very short and sort of ended without telling what happened.
1,I would avoid the new edition,"Oh man, this new printing of TOFD is really bad. DC put new coloring in this paperback and obscures alot of the the great artwork.Since this book has Ra's al Ghul (who appears in the Batman Begins)As a tie-in to the movie DC decided to update the colors, using new advances in printing; then they could sell it to a new generation of comic book readers who might have seen the movie.I would try to get the original edition with the colors untouched and avoid this new one at all costs."
1,pathetic,"As a big batman batman fan, I thought I would get a good volume of original Neal Adams work. When I first opened this book I saw perhaps, the most color enhanced work since Batman: Gotham After Midnight. For some reason,the publishers thought that they should color enhance Neal Adam's masterpieces of Ra's Al ghoul. WE WANT THE ORIGINAL ART! This stuff looks like it came from 1995. Go with the original version, not this stuff!Batman: Tales of the Demon"
5,Freedom House brought back my soul.,"It has been forever since I have been so touched completely by a book. I am a product of the Viet Nam era who became an English and drama teacher. Every character is either someone I knew or a part of my own growth. When one reads this wonderous piece you are touched by the various genres of literature and music included from Hesse, Kerouac, Brigadoon and Carousel! I have strongly suggested this book be included in the A.P. Literature curriculum. A must read for all of America! Academy Awards here it comes!!!!!"
4,A fond morning after,"Wallenbrock has captured the feel of being in the Army in Germany at the end of Viet Nam. His characters are real, the situations are real (hard to believe but that's the way it was), and the blanket of fuzzy haze recaptures the mood. I wonder what happened to all of those serious, far left German university students who were so sure the decant west would fall apart against the shining model of the future the eastern block displayed?"
2,Beyond bad....,"I knew I wasn't expecting much from this movie after reading some of the reviews,but it was far worse than I thought.The narrator was annoying,as was the commentary.It wasn't even good bad,like Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster or The Astounding She-Monster.When I had it on the commentary and the guy was saying here's a good scene or this is really good,I was thinking,You have no idea what you're talking about,do you??? If any of you out there like bad movies,either rent this or stay away completely.You won't find much cheap entertainment here..I'd rather watch Monster A Go-Go instead..."
3,Chevy Chase's famous fall and trips over things on SNL!,"My favorite part of every classic beginning on Saturday Night Live television history during the seventies is when he falls down or trips over things that were waiting to happen for Chevy himself. As he says in every opening credits to this show was ""LIVE FROM NEW YORK IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT! And don't forget his zany antic on weekend update as he was the news anchor person."
5,so fun,"This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again."
1,Flexible but not precise,"This rule is generally of fine quality, the markings are etched and in a nice contrasting black so it's easy to read and the markings are not likely to wear off.It's got graduations in 8ths, 16ths, 32nds and nicely 64ths for those who can see that small.This ruler is indeed very flexible which is handy for measuring curved surfaces.The biggest flaw however, is it did not live up to its claim of being a precision rule. The starting end of the ruler is visibly ground or cut 0.5mm too short rendering measuring from the ends useless!I originally bought 2 of them but both had the same flaw, so it's not a fluke.Pass on this ruler for precision unless you can work around this or can tolerate the lack of quality."
3,12-Inch Flex Stainless Steel Rule,"The good: It was flexible and it is 12 inches. It has inches on one side in 32 and 64ths. The opposite side has 10 and 100ths. It's stainless steel.The bad: The inch graduation is not as a regular rule with long inch, little shorter half inch, little shorter quarter inch lines. If that was there I would have given it a 4 star.I am trying to learn to use the 10ths on the other side because I can see the numbers and the difference in the line marks are not that important. It does work good for a thin gauge to see if my saw blade is lowered into the table top grove. My old eyes can't see the markings to good. I gave it a 3 star because of my eyes otherwise I would have given it a 4 star."
4,Complete History of Mariner,"Extensive list of casualties, each crew member by name. Also extensive bibliography. Covers broad spectrum of Mariner history. Selected action reports. Good history of support ships and Seaplane Tenders."
5,Captivating and Thought Provoking,"Comfortable and effective delivery of very heady, thought provoking ideas by two well established professionals in their fields. Educational, entertaining, and humorous at times, this moves along at a very nice pace. It is so refreshing to see folks expanding their art forms, producing results that are easily digested and enjoyed. Very cool. I wouldn't call this a lecture exactly, but it is easily the most interesting presentation or lecture I have ever witnessed."
5,This is a marker...,"There's not too much you can say about a marker and this one is no exception. So...Fiber tip. You depress it to initially start the flow of ink. After that it stays full.The ""oil-base"" that is mentioned isn't oil. It's a solvent that quickly evaporates, leaving the pigment behind. I'm not sure that I'd want to spend all day in a closed room using these!The marker housing is an aluminum tube.Lastly, the black marker is nice and opaque."
4,Does exactly what it's supposed to do,"A sturdy, well built stapler that functions smoothly and feels comfortable in the hand. Staples are easy to load and clear if they jam. I used it to install and secure coaxial cable to very narrow baseboard where it performed well delivering staples to a tight surface area."
1,Jams Often,"Jams about every 20 staples. I exchanged it where I bought it, at Home Dept, and had the same problem with the replacement."
2,"Stapler received is ""reconditioned' and definitely not new.","T25 wire stapler received promptly with packaging in good condition. The plastic packaging for the stapler had been opened and the stapler has a sicker barely noticeable under the handle stating ""reconditioned"" The stapler had metal shavings in the staple track that had to be cleaned before the stapler could be loaded and used. Works OK now, but definitely not new."
2,not orange,"as a different review said, the best thing about these are that they are orange. not necessarily. the pair i received are black. i ordered these over other wheel chocks that were black for obvious reasons. back they go."
2,Cheap set of chocks,"These chocks are okay if you're using them on flat level ground and only need ""light-duty"" performance. If you use them on an incline for a heavier trailer, they could get flattened as they aren't very rigid.."
2,"Made for lawn mowers, not cars.","Described as ""Safety-orange"" - received ""black"", an unacceptable color for chocks. Also, poor quality to the level of being dangerous."
1,"They sent me BLACK chocks, not orange!","The chocks themselves are great, but when you advertise something in ""safety orange"" color, don't send BLACK which is the worst color in the world for a wheel chock!UPDATE 07/22/2011:Okay, after complaining about receiving BLACK chocks instead of orange as advertised, they send me a SECOND shipment hoping to correct the error. Well, guess what, now I have 2 shipments of BLACK chocks. Somebody seriously needs to fix this problem."
2,instructions on the sticker: two needed per tire,"These are quite light-weight/light-duty.The manufacturer probably realizes this, and the instructions on the sticker state that two chocks should be used for one wheel. (One next to the other, not one on top of the other...)As such, the product description is misleading. Two sets of two (four chocks total) would be needed for one axle of the car. I had to buy an extra pair, doubling the price I expected to pay... I need to chock the front of my car when I lift the rear. (Chocking the rear is not a problem - the hand-brake does a good job.)A side note: How many users read the instructions and actually use two per tire?... In case of failure, the manufacturer can now decline any responsibility..."
2,Is your life worth more than $7?,"I looked at these yesterday at Pep Boys and O'Reilly. I wanted to like them, but they are so lightweight and flimsy feeling, it didn't seem like a place where I would want to save money. Do yourself a favor and find the Buyers WC1467A. They weigh almost 3 pounds each. Hold it side by side with this Blitz product. Considering their role in the safety of you and your vehicle, a pair of Buyers is clearly worth the $13 up-charge."
3,Fewer than expected,"By ""2-pack"" I assumed they meant for two wheels. Not so! Two of these things screwed together = one wheel chock, which is what arrived."
2,Pin stuck together with tougher than light weight chocks,Took me alot of effort to get these two little chocks apart. Stress I didn't need considering I am going to be working on my car and need to focus on that. I would think something for safety would be a bit more heavy weight than these. But I sure hope they are better than nothing at all.
1,what kind of idiot would use this dumb product,"if your idea of fun is playing russian roulette with getting crushed by a car - use this product. these wheel chocks are flimsy and more like toys than something that is supposed to prevent a car from rolling forward or back. in fact, many toys would be more substantial and useful for this purpose than this inferior product. i really do not understand why this dumb product has so many positive reviews - i will not even bother to use mine. you don't have to jump in a river to know you'll get wet. on the plus side: made and designed in the USA. on the down side: see the plus side. is this the kind of thing we're building?"
3,Be Careful!,"I bought these for cheap money and got what I paid for. It is hardened plastic and I suppose it would chock a wheel if you jam it in there just right. These are a safety item and I didn't feel safe with them. Instead, I delayed my project and ordered some rubber ones (raceramps). Night and day difference and gave me a better sense of security.I give it 3 stars because in a driveway, it is probably ok. In a garage without the rough driveway surface...no! Chocking a wheel on ramps...no! Recently while raising my Odyssey in the front for maintenance (both front wheels raise at the same time), there is noway I would use the plastic RhinoGear to prevent it from rolling backwards - that's with it in park and emergency brake on...still need that security. These chocks didn't give it for me.For general applications it is useful but it is NOT for every application."
5,Work well and keep the car from rolling,"What do you say about wheel chocks? They are light, compact, and do a nice job when jacking up a car. They don't slide on my driveway or garage floor."
4,There's one reason to own these...,"...they're orange.I'm not so forgetful that I need a full blown checklist when I change my oil. I've never forgotten to replace the drain plug, or put in oil, etc. However, black tire chocks can sometimes do a good job of... uh... hiding themselves.Seeing the bright orange chocks serves as a reminder that you're not totally done yet.As far as durability goes, I have to agree with other reviewers here. If you're like me, and go all out to ensure you're doing things ""the right way"", they're fine. Would I trust them behind a small to medium sized car with a working parking brake? Sure. Would I trust them to keep a full size pickup with a bad emergency brake on ramps? Never."
3,Don't Feel Safe Enough,"Before I continue, please note that the chocks I have are caution orange instead of the black shown. I honestly think the orange makes it harder to forget about them when cleaning up. That said . . .I'd say that's one of the few redeeming factors for this product. Despite the bottoms having ""teeth"", they don't really have any purchase on solid surfaces such as concrete or tarmac. The vehicle noticeably rolls when wrenching on a lugnut: NOT what I want to see.One chock always seems to ""lock in"" after the first rock or two, but the other stays loose. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect the car to run me over. I'm just not excited about the idea of the car rolling at ALL while I'm fussing with it.I used a couple large bricks before getting these, I started using them again afterwards. That makes this purchase somewhat superfluous.Bottom line: They will keep your vehicle in the driveway, but not necessarily keep it on your jack."
1,Tiny POS,These are junk. Tiny blow molded junk. If you saw these in a store you would not pay $5 for them let alone $12. They are so small they were shipped in a plastic envelope. Do not waste your money.
1,Really cheap.,These are very cheaply made. Backed on to them to chock the front side of the tires on the camper and both chocks buckled. Sorry I bought them.
3,Like the color but expensive,"I like the bright orange color. As other reviewer pointed out, it only comes in as a pair, not four. You can find a cheaper ones at Walmart."
1,Would not buy,I would not leave these outside with the wind blowing. May keep car from rolling but I would not trust them too much. Cheap!
4,Chocks.. they work,"Lightweight, and they sit in each other.Mistakenly, I tried to get off my ramp with them under my tires and they stopped my car. Now I am sure they work. Thought they might need something rubber under it, but apparently they don't."
5,Wheel Chocks......,"What can you say about wheel chocks other than they work. They do work, and I use them in my shop, on my driveway, and any other place I need them to hold a trailer in place."
3,No ffor the MoJack,I ordered these because they were recommended with the MoJack. The MoJack seems to work perfectly without them. The MoJack secures the lawn mower and these have never been used.
3,Short changed!!,"We ordered these for our new RV, but when we opened the shipment (several items were shipped together) we only received one. A single Chock is not very useful when hoping to keep an RV from moving forward or backwards. Description states 2, but only 1 was sent. VERY sad........."
4,Better than a 2x4,"They worked as suggested. Seems kind of flimsy, but they somehow work. If they didn't come with the jack and stands that i bought, i probably wouldn't have bought the chocks seperately. My good old piece of 4x4 will stand guard as backup."
4,Nice stuff,"Light weight, rust proof and very easy to use and effectrive in stopping the wheel from movingBe safe and get this, dont use a brick or a log as wheel choke.Any accident will cost more, a lot more."
3,picture needs to be updated,"This is a very handy tool to have when you don't have much room to work with. But Amazon needs to update their picture with the new model that is made in India, like the one I just got. General has decided to join all the other companies that have left more American workers unemployed so they can increase their own profit margins. Thanks."
3,One major flaw!,"The idea is great - but there is a huge flaw. You cannot secure this well in the rear facing position! We have a 2000 infiniti I30 and a 2006 lexus gx470.In both cars after installation, the seat easily tips backwards ( baby's face can be smashed by car's seat ). granted most of the force in an accident is forward, but there is always some whiplash effect - i can't imagine what would happen in a wreck - we can easily flip the seat with one hand!the instruction manual recommends the use of a ""pool noodle"". that is unacceptable - there is no way to reliably make that secure. in addition, i don't wan't to carry some foam roller in addition to the seat. takes away from the whole portability idea.if your child is going to be forward facing and you use the tether anchor as well as the seat belts- i think it would be ok. but, think twice if your child requires a rear facing seat."
4,"GREAT for occasional/frequent travelers, but has some flaws...","I've owned the stroll-n-go for four years and have used it at least a dozen times flying around the country. It has made those trips much easier than they would have been if we'd been forced to bring both a stroller AND a car seat!That being said, I'm surprised that the consistent problem of the seat-belt coming across the child's chest too high has not been addressed. My son is petite (at four he's 38"" tall and only 31 lbs) and is just NOW tall enough that the belt is no longer a problem. I've wondered many times why the seat can't be made with space in the back through which to thread the seat belt (similar to regular car seats).One pro that is important to mention is the fact that you can steer the stroller with one hand - unlike most umbrella strollers! Having the other hand/arm available to hold another child's hand through the airport, or your coffee, or your shoes as you run from security to your gate, is priceless!"
3,Serves its purpose,Use only for travel. Thought this was kinda expensive for the quality but less than a stroller and car seat. Wheel fold out doesn't always work well- have to try a few times to fold and unfold them. Would not buy this for daily use!! Great for airport travel!!!
3,Great in the Airport!,I loved this as a stroller in the airport. I took my son to Chicago and was able to get around in the airport with ease. When I had to put it in the car as a car seat that is where my disappointment lies. I didn't feel that my son was secure enough in the car.
3,i'ts ok,"we bought this to take our 4 month old on flights and to use as a stroller while out of town. it is ok but make sure to get proficient at it before you leave home. my first problem- the lowest seatbelt level was not tight enough, we pulled the slack all the way out and i could still get my hand underneath and my baby is not small. we put it on the next level and it was WAY above his shoulders. so we put the head rest on thinking that would help, but it just pushed his head forward so his breathing was almost obstructed. the second problem was that it does not fit down all aircraft aisles as claimed. we take alot of ""connection"" flights(the ones with two seats on each side) and it is too big for the aisles. so we had to pick him up and carry him through the narrow aisles dodging people's heads. all this said, what choice do you have? we are still going to use it."
2,"Great For Travel, Not For Touring","As others have mentioned, this is a compact option for air and train travel, allowing you travel without having to pack a stroller AND car seat. That said, I would not purchase this item again because of the weak construction of the stroller portion.The name - 5-in-1 - is a bit disingenuous because 4 of the options (rear facing, forward facing, booster seat, airplane seat) can easily be applied to ANY car seat.Another reviewer mentioned this is ""not a stroller I would use on a regular basis"" and I couldn't agree more. The wheels are so poorly put together that navigating simple rises in pavement or the space between the jetway and the place are extraordinarily difficult. We've probably used this on 8-10 trips and the front wheels snapped off when exiting a plane this last trip - effectively making this a 1-in-1 sit 'n' drag. We ended up having to buy an umbrella stroller anyway, nullifying this product's main benefit, compactness."
2,Does not fit into airplane seats,This combo-stroller works well as a stroller and is quite adequate as a car seat. It is quite easy to convert and fits through airport security scanners if positioned properly.My problems with it are-1. It is unusable in most Economy airline seats as it is too wide. I was made to check it in on 2 consecutive flights.2. It is overpriced for something that is basically only a car seat- stroller combo.
2,Ok item - works for what it is,if you are traveling on an airplane this works pretty well - easy enough to change from stroller to seat and back - it rolled down the aisle of one of our flights but was too wide to fit down the aisle of the other; still have no idea how it works as a booster seat for eating at a tabletwo main issues: its kind of a pain in the neck to strap in and remove from rent-a-car all the time but the alternative is to travel with a both a plane/car seat AND a strollerandthe forward facing config w the seat belt/strap in front of the child always seemed like we were doing it wrong - for the seat to be tight in the car or on the plane the strap was pretty tight across our 17 mo old son's chest - just didnt seem 'safe'in the end it was fine for a week - although i am not sure i wouldnt go with the lightweight stroller/separate car/plane seat if i had it to do all over again
4,Functional and Priced well.,What can you say other than it works well and it was priced right. No sense paying top dollar for a metallic Sharpie.
4,Nice little gadget,It is a very nice little gadget. Handy and useful for both shop and home use. Tip reversal is a clever contrievance. It is a pity that it seems that it has been discontinued.
1,Only 1 Per Pack,"I ordered this November 4 - it took almost two months to get - and when it finally gets here, there is only one - for $16.99. I can get one for 8.99 at Wal-Mart. They work very well, but $16.99 is way too high for me."
2,picture misleading,The picture shows 2 filters but I only received one. And included with the filter was an order form showing a lower price than what I paid. I like the filter but could get 2 for the same price elsewhere.
1,Not happy at all.,I was expecting two filters based on the item description and pictures. I purchased this item only because I thought I was getting two filters - I could have gotten a better price elsewhere for just one. This is very deceptive marketing and I am upset with Amazon for allowing this to continue as I noticed others have made the same kind of reviews already. I would like my second filter to make this sqaure.
2,2-for-1...NOPE!,"**PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY**Their image shows 2 filters. Their description says ""Holmes HAPF22 Filters..."" (notice the ""s"", as in more than 1). I put two and two together, but only got ONE.Misleading? Yes. Do I feel like I deserved it because I didn't read the other reviews that clearly state the same thing? No.But, I do feel duped.Lame."
1,$18..for *ONE* filter from Amazon...,Photo shows *TWO* items. Only received *ONE* item. Horrible pricing for *ONE* filter. Had to check the site again..sure enough.. Been duped. Horrible.
1,Very Unhappy,I'm totally unhappy with this CD for the simple reason that I can't play it. There was no mention that I saw that the CD might not work on my CD player. VERY displeased.
3,Some good essays,"Some of these esays are really interesting, infact most of them are good. There are some really boring as well. This is light reading about Tolkein from a mostly Catholic perspective. If you want heavy duty scholarship, this isn't the book, but if you want something to read with the morning coffee I really recommend it."
5,"Great HP product, as always","I always try to go HP when possible for two reasons. They always do a solid job at building great products AND they back the products with the best customer service I have ever seen. I doubt I will ever need customer service for this USB floppy, but I am always willing to pay the extra bucks to get HP quality. I have bought anything from $40,000 plotters and servers to $400 photosmart printers to $20 keyboards from HP and they have always been solid produts."
1,"Does not work with Windows 7, probably not Vista either.","Windows 7 64-bit reports that the driver is installed successfully, you'll even see it in Device Manager, but no way to see the files in Windows Explorer or otherwise do anything with them. Probably the same if you have Vista. The positive reviews are likely from people still running XP, and they should identify their operating system before claiming ""it works great!!"".No warning from Amazon that this does not work under the current Windows OS, which has been out for a couple years now, no less, so it's going back for a refund."
3,Not impressed,"Item arrived and the first thing I noticed is that it is a Compaq and not an HP. I went ahead and used it anyway, plugged it in and instantly a problem, the cable is too short for it to sit on the desk. My case is a mid size case and is about an inch and a half short of being able to sit on the desk, can't put it on the top because I have exhaust fans there. Is everything gotten so cheap they can't give you a few more inches of cable? At least it works."
5,Equipment performed as expected,Good to have these available for those older fiiles! I can re-use my stock of floppy disks now. Thanks a lot.
4,"an old family favorite--sure to please, or get a laugh!","This album was one our family ""dug out"" year after year! It seems that it was there since I was born, maybe before. I was born in 1965. A lot of the songs are classic Christmas songs--Christian + secular as well. They are done w/ this wierd funky ""jazzed up"" twist...I distinctly remember ""Go tell it on the Mountain""--by the time I was a teenager, their rendition was SO funny! I no longer have a turn-table or I would buy it! My mom still has the origional, but it is scratched up from YEARS of use.If you like wierd ""oldies"" music, you'll LOVE it! If you grew up with it, You HAVE to have it for your children (if only to torture them!)"
4,I really enjoyed this book.,"I found I could not put it down. I have been trying to find other books involving Amazon Women and have not had much luck. I liked the concept of the Amazon women, and their show of strength and independence. I do not necessarily feel that they need to hate men in order to show this."
1,I TRIED BUT COULDENT FINISH THIS ONE,"Ouch!!! I'm a huge McCammon fan, hands down. But this is his absolute worst. His earliest work just dosent do it for me. Luckily the 1st McCammon I read way Boys Life. Man I was hooked after that. Bethanys Sin is boring, slow-paced & uggg just plain boring."
2,tried hard - but generally forgettable,My second Mccammon book after the wonders of Boy's Life and i knew not to expect much from this early attempt at a horror novel It starts ok-ish but ends up as some James bond story that is just beyond belief. The characters are tame and I just couldnt care how it was going to end. He tried hard to make it creepy but really over did it making everything appear scary and therefore taking away the surprise element. what got me was how he tried to introduce a quaint Englishness into the dialect by saying 'by God' all the time. But this is Middle America Robert ?
2,Difficult to get spare parts,"Robust tool Arrow looks. I got it as a replacement for Taiwanees swivel head riveter, what served me well over 1200 3/16 rivets. Arrow looks the same but after 46 rivets locking collets slipps do not hold rivet shank. Asked supplier for service just smilly faces . Great Taiwaneese tool it broke in hinge but never sliped. Now I am on Amazon try to get 2 collets for 40c. But no spare parts. Who will put the economy in to gear - Wall street ?"
1,What a terrible piece of junk,"I've used it several times but now that I'm in the middle of an important project, it completely fails. I've taken it apart to try and fix it but no go. If you're considering this product, I'd look elsewhere. While researching the problem I found a customer service #. Called it many times and just get a voice saying all lines are busy. Very frustrating."
1,This is an Arrow product?,"My first Arrow RHT 300 failed after 12 rivets. I did, as others, dissaseemble and clear it. Still didn't work. I returned it and the new one does nothing. I'm using Arrow rivets spec'd for this gune with Arrow washers. Completely confused how this piece of junk made it from a bench in the States to the factory in China. I've used Arrow staplers for years with great satisfaction. This product absolutely stinks."
1,Broke after 20 rivets,"It stopped pulling after 20 rivets or so. When it was woking it was difficult to use. Hard to use only one had, which is how is designed to be used. I would have taken it back even if it did not break. I replaced it with Harbor Freight rivter that looks exactly like this:Dorman 743-100 Rivet Gun. Works perfectly after about 500 rivets."
1,Don't get this one.,The head split and broke within the first 5 rivets I used it for. Wouldn't recommend this one. Try another brand or a higher quality.
1,Garbage!,"One of the worst tools I've ever owned. It jammed after about a dozen rivets. No way to clear it. Totally frustrating when you are in the middle of a project. The quality is so poor that I will do anything I can to avoid Arrow in the future. Luckily, the Arrow staple gun I already own has yet to fail. Maybe they should stick to staples!"
4,Works well for soft metal rivets,"This rivet gun pulls aluminum rivets fairly well. However this weekend I tried to pull some monel rivets with little success. I was able to get them tight, but the gun just would not grab well enough to actually pop the pop rivet (strength or not).It's a decent gun that will pull soft metals, but not hard ones (no matter how much force you put on it)."
2,Didn't last long,"This riveter seems heavy and as though it's a quiality tool, but it didn't last long. Like DT above, the riveter no longer pulls out the extract from the rivet and can no longer be used. I too disassembled it and put it back together, to no avail. I thought about getting another one because it seems like they used quality, solid metal to build it... but apparently this is a common problem with these riveters. I will look elsewhere."
2,Works for a short while,"Usually Arrow equipment lasts a while, and on contact you'd expect that from this unit. It's heavy and the exterior is strong. This riveter has features, but stopped working about the third time I used it; it jammed up and no longer can pull rivets through even after clearing. Even when it did work, it required a huge effort to squeeze-and-pull the rivets."
4,spent compost,"spent compost it can use to fodder for livestock , soil conditioner and fertilizer in addition to can ferment it to compost of Volvariella volvacea"
2,Don't kid yourself,"Yeah...don't kid yourself. Brian tyler only got the gig because Jerry Goldsmith didn't have time to rewrite the score on Richard Donner's request. The result?? A washed out score that has no backbone and is more of a Hans Zimmer sound (which is ironic because Hans Zimmer doesn't write his own music anyway) than it is a good sound. Don't waste your money on this horrible score. And furthermore, don't bank on Brian Tyler moving anywhere in his career if this score is an example of the chops the guy has."
4,Energetic Music,"When I first saw the movie in the theater I wanted the soundtrack right away, but it wasn't available at the time, as most movie scores are not avialable at the time of the movie release (annoying). When I saw the movie again after it came out on DVD I went in search of the music. It has a lot of ""driving"" rhythms that are very exciting and wonderful to listen to. The composer was unknown to me, but I was quite impressed. To me, great movie music lets you see scenes in your head when you are listening to the music, and this one meets that criteria. Enjoy! :)"
5,A true study from a true scholar,This was an excellent study of a complex topic. Professor Shimko should be congratulated for his thoughtful analysis of this issue. Highly recommended.
2,2 Flaws,"Amazon's price is right, (I paid $17+). This is a good product and nice design but has two flaws which I've experienced and I see in some other reviews. 1st is the screen unscrews on its own and you'll end up w/ grounds in you're coffee if you're not vigilante on tightening this down before each brew. 2nd, the cup tappers down at the bottom so the engineers challenge was to figure out how to design a screen that changes dia. from top of the cup to the bottom and they weren't 100% successful. If you fill the cup all the way to the max. you'll again, end up w/ grounds in your coffee. I measured the cup to be 15oz., subtract 2oz. max at the top and 2 at the bottom (coffee grounds)and you end up w/ 11oz.-13oz. of coffee. These are my measured estimates."
5,Best Mug EVER!,This mug is great! It's so quick and convenient for me to have my morning coffee even if I'm running late with this thing!
4,Perfectly good travel mug - but don't drop it!,"I find this mug does its job perfectly well, keeps my coffee hot and I have not had any spills. I do have to be careful that the rubber ring around the top is in place before closing the lid. This is the second of this clear bodum mugs that I buy. I bought this one as a replacement for the exact same mug that I had previously because it broke when I dropped it. So the only drawback is that it doesn't resist drops very well. Also, I am not a fan of the ""give up bad coffee for good"" logo, and would much prefer a plain mug, but that is personal preference."
3,"Bought two, one defective, other so so","Trying to find an inexpensive travel mug is challenging. I'm not sure that the great price on this one is worth it though.Pros:-Cool design-easy to drink from with no leaksCons:-doesn't keep beverages warm for long, although it is a little better than another mug I bought at the same time-I had to throw one of the 2 mugs I bought away after water got between the layers of plastic and wouldn't dry. This happened after about the third cycle through the dishwasher. They are labeled diswasher safe, and I only wash my mugs on the top rack as directed. Being a clear mug, I could see the water, and despite airdrying then heat drying the mug, it wouldn't go away. Definite source of nastiness."
2,Broke after one week,"I got this travel mug after reading several reviews, and like most Bodum products. Unfortunately, I happened to drop this mug within the first week of using it while washing it in the sink, and the liner became disconnected from the outside, and is impossible to keep together now-- definitely not okay to use on the go anymore with hot liquids. Unfortunate, because I liked the cap/mouth opening a whole lot, and it seemed pretty spill-proof."
3,this is NOT a FRENCH PRESS,"This came up when I did a search for french presses so I ordered it. It's just a mug. It seems like a nice mug so far and it's BPA-Free, but if you're looking for a french press, look elsewhere."
5,"Great ruler for home, shop, or business use.","An outstanding high quality product, you can usually tell how good something is by how many people try to steal it from you.I've had to buy my kids & girlfriend their own rulers so they'd leave mine alone."
3,Pre-rusted!,"Despite the packaging, the ruler arrived with little spots of rust on mm/32nds of a inch side. Nothing that ruins it for use, just a bit disappointing for a new product."
2,poor quality of stainless steel,I just bought two and found sporastic rust on the surface when I opened packages. They were also very thin.
1,Crappy,"3 months... and now dead. Lights flash, sweeper just sits dead as a doornail. 3 emails to customer service, not one replied.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this flimsy over-hyped piece of garbage."
3,not as powerful as I hoped,From the reviews I had pcitured a more powerful vacuum. It works decently but still pushes dirt around on tile and hardwood floors.
1,save your money PLEASE,"I got a shark 3 months ago. I have had to buy belts 9.99 + shipping. I had to but a new handle 7.99 plus shipping, Had to replace the motor 19.99 + shipping. ANd I replaced all that stuff in 3 months. It need another motor AGAIN and my hubby say NO way, take the thing to the trash. It was very nice to have and easy to use but dose not last. I am good with my stuff and this thing still broke.My Mom got one for Christams and she has put over 50.00 in it to keep it running. Her's is borke again so I will take mine to hers so she can use the piecs of of mine.......... O what a mess this thing is."
1,Never worked out of the box,"It turned on once briefly before I charged it and never worked again. I read the reviews on Amazon (should have done that before I bought it) and decided to return it. I bought a Swiffer Sweeper at Target instead, for only $30 and it's been working great (although not for carpet). Save your money and buy something else!!"
1,A piece of JUNK,"This arrived after nearly six weeks ! I charged it for 20 hours as recommended by the manufacturer. All it did after that was a bit of noise when I turned it on, and soon died. I put on the charger again for a day. It did the same thing. This item was shipped to be apparently with a bad battery. It is not worth the hassle of buying at Amazon which does not make sure that the item they ship out is in good working order. This is the last time I will ever order anything electronic or electrical from Amazon. I will simply stick to books."
1,Waste of Money,I have bought shark and used it for a month and the side brush stopped working . I replaced it with the new one from amazon and again the same problem . Please donot buy this product it is horrible as fully charged battery only works for 10-15 minutes and side brush damages easily . I will say if you want to waste 80 dollars then go and buy it . When I called shark they won't gurantee anything they were asking 25 dollar for that small brush .This whole system sucks except that it cleans hardfloor nice thats why it earned 1 star.
1,Returned item,"Product would never charge....After several appeals for assistance from both Amazon.com, AND Sharkvac.com, with no reply, I returned it to Amazon.com - Returns. Too much aggravation.........."
1,waste of Christmas money,I received this sweeper as a Christmas present. I used it for about 4 months and then the brush stopped turning. Then the sweeper stopped working completely - the lights flash but nothing else happens.The only reason I don't just dump it is I hate to put machines and junk like that in the trash.It really deserves zero stars.
2,Euro-Pro versus less expensive,"I have a less expensive cordless sweeper that is doing a great job but I thought I would give this cordless a try. I have been very disappointed in it's performance. I have allot of pets and hair has always been a problem. Instead of this vacuum picking up the hair, a large amount of hair seems to sick to the bottom of it so I have to constantly pick up the vac to shake it off and then let the vacuum give it another try. I have another vacuum, not a shark, that picks up almost every bit of hair and puts it where it belongs. The only thing I like about this vacuum is the disposal system where as it pops out to empty so you really don't have to touch the dirt in any way. I have also used it on the carpet but it really doesn't do a very good job. I am very tempted to return this vacuum and buy two more vacuums of the one I have for what this vacuum cost me.Linda (Florida)"
3,Operation of the Euro-Pro Shark Sweeper V1730,"After full charge the sweeper works well on flat surface but when using on carpeting and rugs it lessens it power and the third light turns yellow. On the flat surface it stays green. A similar sweeper was advertised on the TV at a lower cost. In conclusion, this rechargeable sweeper is not as powerful as first thought and has to be recharged constantly. Thank you"
2,Great sweeper when it works,"This is my second pro sweeper and my third Shark sweeper. The first model lasted almost three years so when I saw the Pro I upgraded because of it's few extra features. It was fantastic for about a year and then it just didn't work anymore. I bought a new battery and cradle for it, still nothing. After much thought I decided to just buy a new one to my dismay the cradle I had just purchased for the very same model didn't work for my new one... I am not a glutton for punishment, I just found myself invested in accessories for this model. As it happens the second ""improved"" pro model does not work as well or last as long as the first one did. Additionally, DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY WITH REGARD TO CUSTOMER SERVICE! If you actually get a living breathing person on the line, it is unlikely you will be able to understand them because of a thick accent and horrible long distance connection. Overall, I am done with Shark."
1,This product doesn't suck... that's the problem,"I don't get it- so many honest people struggle to stay in business each day, but these guys are still going. The sad part is, this machine would be good if it actually worked for more than 2 weeks. I want to say it sucks, but that's the whole problem... it doesn't."
1,Broke with light use,"I have had this product and used it very lightly for a little over a year. It has spent most of its time plugged in. I may have used it for about 10min per month, if that. Today when I went to use it, the handle broke rendering it very difficult to use - if the handle doesn't lock standing upright, then everything in the dirt tray falls out when the sweeper is picked up.I consider it a major fault when a product breaks with light use. I don't know if the newer models are better, but I won't be buying one to find out."
3,Shark v1730 Cordless sweeper,The product work ok. The supplier advertised that it contained the hand held sweeper but it didn't. When I asked about it they said they had a note about it. The note wasn't in an obvious place and the title said that it included the hand held sweep. This was the reason I had decide to order from them.
4,Great little vac,"I have an earlier model of this machine, and just love it. Mind you, it's not designed for heavy cleaning of carpet and so on, but for the day-to-day things like spilled kitty litter, it's perfect.It's maintained a charge well, and I've yet to purchase a new battery. It's quiet enough that the entire household isn't disturbed when it's used... Well done!"
2,Shark sweeper,"This is a great sweeper, but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery. We bought one a couple of years ago from Sears with a Sears replacement warranty. Since then we have replaced it FIVE times (we really got our money's worth from the warranty, at least!)It's getting to be a joke--one day (usually 2-3 months after we bring home the new one) the rotor just stops turning and that's all she wrote. Next time we will purchase a different sweeper, warranty or not."
1,A piece of junk,"This is the first time I've ever taken the time to write a review on a product I purchased. But I feel so strongly about the inferiority of this product that I felt it was necessary to help others avoid wasting their hard-earned money. When I first received it, it worked okay. Not long after, it just crapped out and customer service is horrible (no response to emails). Please, please - save your money. (I would have given it '0' stars but the lowest rating it allows here is 1.)"
1,frustrated,Used the sweeper twice and it never worked again. I followed all directions for charging and nothing. a piece of junk!
4,for large wrists!,"I love the way this watch looks. If you have a smaller wrist, do not buy this. My jeweler will not even attempt to shorten the expansion band."
5,Another winner,"I love how different Lone Wolf Films are from anything I've ever seen. The Harvest is a beautifully strange and interesting film, and the cinematography is great! I love and support independent horror films, and this is another great one to add to my collection."
4,Excellent Music,Thomas reaches the heart of those who love traditional african music.It simply emanates above any other of the african music diaspora.
2,Needs a rethinking,"This fan would be decent except for one thing: the pathetic control system. Aside from the intake/exhaust switches, there is only one button on the fan. Not a switch, a dial, or anything else but a lone button. One button to cycle through high/low, on/off, and the various temperature settings. Airflow is adequate and it is not terribly loud. Basically, this is a decent fan, but you can get a better one for less."
1,Not a great fan,"After reading several wonderful reviews on several different sites I decided these were the fans for my mother's house. I received them (promptly as always from Amazon)and set one up to try it out. They are the most quiet fans I have ever heard!! Probably because they move no air whatsoever! I tried it on intake, I tried it on exhaust, I can move more air with a paper fan than these can.I will say that they are quite attractive, easy to set up and operate. If your house has good cross ventilation they may lower it a degree or two on a hot day. If you want to really cool your house, find something else.I'm still looking :)"
1,The Left Blade Wobbles,"The left blade wobbles and makes a terrible waka-waka-waka-waka-waka sound. It also vibrates, which is not good for the window that it is mounted in."
3,Died after 1 year,"Fan worked ok and was very quiet, but that didnt last. Died after only 1 year of use. Too costly of an item to last such a short time."
3,Not much power,Even at its highest setting there is not much air coming in. We have a $20 fan from Walmart that works much better. Also the thermostat does not work properly and it turns on and off every minute or two.
4,Window fans,"Easy to install and seems to work quite well. It is not as powerful as the Honeywell dual control window fan it replaced, but then, the Honeywell died in less than a year of operation. The Holmes dual fan I have in the kitchen has been running steadily without a glitch for four years. I hope this one will do as well in the bedroom. I wish they had the power of the Honeywell-- but I guess, endurance is worth more than power when it comes down to dollar value."
4,Good window fan.,Good fan. Fits perfectly in my window sideways. I did a decent amount of research and finally chose this one. If you are looking for a window fan get this one.
4,pleased,the product is good especially with the reverse fan mode and does turn on and off at certain temps.r i'd recommened it for small space users....so far so good
3,Works ok but still a disappointment,"I bought a couple of these fans two years ago, and they are still operating. That's the minimum I would expect. In addition, the mechanism to secure the accordion-fold side shield works smoothly and it is possible to install the fan without pinching one's fingers--always a plus.However, the volume of air moved is quite disappointing--seemingly a fraction of the amount moved by my older Honeywell HW-628 Enviracaire Twin Window Fans, which inexplicably seem to have been discontinued. The difference in cooling power is noticible. In addition, while this model runs smoothly, it is noisier than I would like. I won't be buying these again if I can find a more powerful replacement."
4,Good purchase.,"I didn't install this in my window because I have a shelf under my window so I just set it on it and fired it up. My bedroom it typically at least 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the house and has poor ventilation making it seem hotter than it is. I was intrigued when I saw that the fans operate independently. Since it never gets cold in my room I can't ever see myself ever using the thermostat.It didn't take long to notice a difference. I wasn't expecting it to cool the room much as it is a fan not an AC unit, but it did cool it down a few degrees. Mostly though it made it so it no longer felt stuffy.I'm not giving it five stars because I'd have liked it to be a bit more powerful and a little quieter."
3,Works as advertised,Bought this fan a couple weeks ago. It does a pretty good job of cooling a room. The temperature feature is nice except the fan cycles on and off repeatedly when the temperature hits the set temperature which can be annoying. On the low setting there is a bit of a rattle in one fan.
5,This is great for what it is,"I would have preferred a single 12"" window fan. I haven't been able to find one for at least a couple of years. This double works well and the controls are easy to figure out. I bought another model that was a little more expensive because the controls were digital but I don't like it as much and it was more expensive. I've had this now for about 6 weeks. I'm pretty satisfied except that I wish I could have found a bigger one."
4,"good price, good fan","I was actually impressed with the power. For an inexpensive fan, it does a good job. It's not exactly ""whisper"" quiet, but it sounds like it should - like a fan. Don't expect perfect silence. Very easy to set up and the one-touch temperature controls are very cool, although mine is always set on high since I'm really, really fat and I sweat all the time. OK, I'm really not fat, just sweaty. Anyway, in my opinion, this a good deal and I would recommend buying it. Gotta love Amazon.com."
4,Not bad,"I have another Holmes twin window fan. Amazon.com only offers HAWF2043 model. So I bought one. It is not bad. But, 1) when you turn the fan on, both fans have to be turned on. There is no choice of only one fan being turned on. 2) When you turn it on, it has some machine noise beside the fan noise. 3) Cannot really tell the difference on low/high or between fan speed. If you have to buy it, buy HAWF2041 model. Same price, better function. It covers all 3 points mentioned above."
1,Horrible fan DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY- no power,"I bought this fan because it is starting to get hot in New York and I couldn't stand it anymore. I ordered this fan because it was the highest rated window fan on Amazon, but now I think the system is rigged because this is the worst fan I've ever bought. The fan has less power than my own lungs. There are several settings, none of which seem to do anything, and when the fan is on it's highest ""setting"" it blows with almost no power. If I could give it zero stars I would, but here I can only give one star. I'm sending it back to Amazon. I do NOT recommend this fan unless you just want to put something in your window that blocks your view and doesn't blow at all. I have no idea why people would recommend this fan, it really does not perform"
3,"works as advertised, but sensor hot even when off; must be energy vampire","Product works as advertised and reviewed, quiet, effective, fits in the window well. One small complaint; it has a temperature sensor which does not seem particularly useful to me, since I don't use the thermostat--I prefer to have it run constantly and turn it off myself when I don't want it on. Additionally, there's some part of it that stays on permanently and gets very hot even when the unit is off. From an energy conservation standpoint, that's just silly. I now plug it into a power strip and turn the power strip off so that it doesn't unnecessarily use power."
4,Window Fan,"I really like the fan. It cools down my bedroom quite nice. It is quite loud though, but if that doesn't bother you, this window fan is just right."
5,Holmes Twin Window Fan Model 2043,"This fan is one of the most efficient fans, I've used. Being able to set it for different temperatures, plus using it as an exhaust fan, takes the hassle out of having to get up at night to adjust it. It is also light weight and easy to install in a window, and take out during a storm. Storage during the winter is easy because of the small size. I think they are just as efficient as an air conditioning unit when used for pulling cool air in at night. I intend on buying one more for the guest room, then my cooling system will be complete."
2,Annoying,"The fan was purchased to sit above the doors of my greenhouse to exhaust warmer air during the summer. If there is any even very BRIEF pause in the electircal supply, the fan has an annoying problem of not turning back on when the electrical supply resumes. Since it is rather high above the door, this involves getting on a ladder to re-set the fairly needlessly complicated settings.When I called ""customer support,"" the lady kindly read to me from the instruction pamphlet which came with the fan and which offered no help whatsoever. She also said that the ""technical"" people didn't know any more information and would not be of any assistance. She also was good enough to point out to me that the fan was functioning as it was designed.Again, annoying! Sloppy design, and poor customer support."
2,low air flow,this fan is quiet but hardly moves any air on high speed. i have other window fans (discontiued) that move MUCH more air. also would like to be able to shut off one side if I wanted.
3,Mediocre performance window fan,"I was so excited just reading the reviews. They were all positive except for the noise. Well that noise part cannot be an clearer. This thing is LOUD, even at lowest speed it sounds like turning on your ventilation in the bathroom. As far as performance, it some what cools the room. This fan is meant more as an air exchange device, removing odor and pulling in fresh air outside. I wouldnt buy it again though. I rather save up for an air conditioner."
2,very weak,"The fan is sturdy, and as advertised; unfortunately, even on the 'high' setting, it is very weak. It does not move much air. While sitting about 10 feet away from the fan I could only barely feel a breeze."
1,THUMBS DOWN,"This fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room. Go for the industrial strength, expensive ones."
3,on/off,"Am looking for a twin window fan with seperate on/off switch for each side. This is not it! It's nice, but I want to be able to run just 1 fan at a time sometimes."
1,Window fan holmes,"I have bought this fan for a reason, so I can get a comfortable room temperature but Instead of cooling room this fan makes the room more hotter. Yes it works nicely only if the temperature outside is cooler when you really donot need this fan to be on. So to me for the price I paid its not worth. Unless u want to experiment. Good luck"
2,Themostat is useless,"Everything about this fan is fine except the thermostat. It limit-cycles. That means, when the temperature is near the set point, it switches on and off continuously every couple seconds. This is way less efficient electrically, and annoying to listen to. Instead, a control loop needs to implement hysteresis, preventing this from happening. (This is elementary -- did they take an 8th grade science project for the design?)The cheaper model doesn't have the thermostat but everything else is the same. Buy that one. You're going to use this one in that mode anyway."
2,"Overpriced, but so are all fans","I'm not sure this fan is worth $50. However, I find that all fans are extremely overpriced. I should have paid the extra $10-$20 for a tower fan, but I wanted one for the window. The high setting is not very high. Also, they advertise the one button to be convenient, but it's kind of annoying to scroll through 10 settings to turn the fan off; it goes through Low - 60,65,70,75,80 degrees & high - 60,65,70,75,80 degrees before it turns off. Other than that, it pretty much does what I wanted, bringing the cold air from outside into the room..."
4,"Quiet and powerful, but...","This window fan does a great job with it's primary function - moving air around and cooling a room, even a large one. Our bedroom is 20'x14', and this fan has no trouble cooling the room quickly. For that I'd give it five stars.However, when it comes to the temperature settings, this fan seems to be a bust. We have two of them for two different rooms, and the temperature controls don't work on either one. On one fan, when you set the fan to turn off at a certain temperature, it just keeps turning on and off, over and over again. The other fan will just keep running, even when the fan is set to turn off at 80 degrees and it's freezing in the room. We got these fans at different times and places, so I'm pretty sure we didn't just get a bad batch.So if you can live without the temperature settings, it's a great fan. The price is fair for the job it does, and we've had our oldest for over five years,and it's still going strong."
5,The right mix of price and performance,"Living in the Pacific Northwest, it never gets hot enough for long enough that buying an air conditioner makes sense. But living in a 100+ year-old house, when it gets a little warm outside, it gets very warm inside when the sun comes outI've bought two of these fans now and think they're terrific. The first I bought for the main bedroom, and setting the thermostat meant a comfortable summer night's sleep without having to get up and turn off the fan at 3 in the morning. The second I bought for the upstairs, converted to a room from unused attic space years ago, and now it's usable year-round. I don't know if this would carry you through a summer in Texas, but it has been great for me. There are more expensive models with remote controls, but I haven't missed having one. Oh, and it definitely works best to have one fan set to intake and one fan set to exhaust."
2,Not worth the money,"I've had good luck with Holmes fans over the years and have owned several of them. When one of ours suffered a fatal fall during the summer, I picked up this model at our local big box store. I should have spent the extra $ and ordered the HAWF3095 from amazon instead. First of all, there is a single button that takes you through the 13 possible settings: High, Low, High + temperature (60, 65, 70, 75, 80), Low + temperature, and Off. This sort of interface should be used when there are only 4-5 options to cycle through; with 13 it's ridiculous. The worse problem is the temperature control itself. Whenever the temperature outside approaches the target that you set, the fan will start to cycle on and off repeatedly. You're much better off spending the few extra dollars to get the ""AccuTemp"" model. The interface isn't a huge improvement, but the temperature control is much better."
4,"Great fan, thermostat really works","I ordered two of these and they work very well. They fit in the window perfectly, and the cord is long enough to reach the outlet. You don't have to turn the fan off to go from blowing in to blowing out, which is a plus.The thermostat is a mixed blessing. It actually works, which means that while you are trying to sleep, you can hear the fan cycling. So instead of a constant hum, it's up and down and fast and slow. I recommend using the thermostat when the noise doesn't matter, but just leaving it ON when you're trying to sleep."
4,COMPACT UNIT,"THIS IS A VERY QUIET FAN WITH NICE OPTIONS FOR TWO SPEEDS AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL. I WOULD PREFER IT TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE SETTINGS, BUT THIS IS NOT A BIG ISSUE. I AM HAPPY WITH THE WINDOW FAN. THE COMPANY OFFERS ADAPTERS FOR FITTING WIDER WINDOWS."
2,"Seems like a nice fan, wish I got one that worked right","Gave it 2 stars only because the shipping was unbelievably fast. Considering the size of the box and weight, I was surprised to see it at my doorstep in just 48hours.It would of gotten 1 star because the fan I received seemed like the axle the fan spins on was either damaged during shipping or was defective because when the fan was on low it shook so much it was like I had a washing machine in my window. VERY LOUD.And what really didn't make sense was that the High setting worked better (less shaking/noise volume) then the low setting.Luckily Amazon is taking it back, and I am using my refund to by the more expensive Bionaire model because of the remote and the 100+ better reviews"
1,Loved my old one but this has zero power!!,"I had a Homes duel window wan with exhaust 7 years ago and it was so wonderful. This new one.... Well I can make a paper fan and wave it at you and that's about as much air as you get!Shame on Holmes for making this weaker.Someone said they think they were trying to make a very quiet version... well it is quiet but at a cost. No power in the air flow. My box fan which is not that great is ten times the power and my same box fan use to pale in comparison to my old holmes. Thats why I bought this one, because the old one was so good. This is garbage so please do not buy this. Find a fan that blows air!"
3,good product!,this fan does its job in pushing air in and out. but it doesnt blow as hard as i thought it would be. i like to use fans in my window when it gets cold to keep the apartment cold and works ok for a decent size room but i wish it blew harder. fits good in the window and has extenders to fit wider windows
5,More than what I expected,I orginally bought a more expensive fan for a room with out an a/c also I wanted something to suck out the stale air because I live on a main street that has lots of trucks. I was so impressed by how that one cooled the air in the room I decided to get two more for my other rooms so I don't have to keep the a/c's on all the time and have an huge electric bill. The one I orginally bought was out of stock so I found this one and I found this works great I turn up the temp to 80 when I am at work and when I come home I lower it to 75 when I go to sleep I lower it again to 70. It cooled the room great. It even help when I put the a/c's on in those rooms since they don't have to lower the temp that much. I found that this was a great buy and would recommend this to anyone. I also didn't think it was very noisy at all I grew up with the old box window fans that made alot of noise so this is whisper quiet compared to them.
4,A breath of fresh air,"This fan is great. It's quiet (even at high speed). It does a good job for a large room (12x14, 8' ceiling). I wish there was a separate button to turn it off/on. You have to scan through speed/temp settings to turn off.Would have given it 5 stars, but I haven't had it long enough and the control settings thing."
1,died . . .,". . . after minimal use. Bought July 2011, used for the remainder of summer, went to set it up again for 2012, and its dead."
5,Energy efficient,"[Note: The fan I purchased has the model number HWF0910AT, but the picture, the description, and the price match the unit advertised.] I bought this fan two weeks ago. It works fine. I live in southern New Mexico, and use the fan overnight to cool the house down instead of using the air conditioner. It is rated at 0.6 amps. At 120 volts that gives a power rating of 72 watts. So running the fan for one hour consumes 0.072 kWh of electricity. Where I live, one kWh costs just under 12 cents. That comes out to less than 9/10ths of a cent per hour, or less than 9 cents for ten hours of operation. That's pretty good."
5,Holmes Twin Window Fan,"The fan was mailed promptly and arrived quickly to my home. It has been great these last couple hot and humid weeks. I especially like the fact that: 1. it is quiet and 2. you can set it in such a way that causes the fan to turn on when it is say, 75 degrees F and off when it hits 70 degrees F. Therefore, I never get too cold and have to manually shut it off during the night. It's a great fan at a very reasonable price and if the whether wasn't cooling down, I'd probably be buying another one for the guest room."
3,good but loud,"This is a good dual fan, but it's loud, even on low. I do not recommend it for a bedroom window -- you won't get to sleep. But for other rooms where a certain level of quiet isn't necessary, it's worth it."
1,Very flimsy!,"I purchased this fan about a month ago. It worked wonderfully for approximately 4 weeks, and then just mysteriously broke. When I press the power button, several lights go on, and nothing else happens. One month and $35 later, I have a lousy broken fan that is destined for the dumpster. I am sure this flimsy fan was manufactured with planned senescence in mind, but c'mon - one month?! Leaves me more than a little depressed about our throw-away society. Now I'm on a flea market lookout for a 1950s metal window fan that still works like a charm..."
1,JUNK,"Worked for two months and did a ok job. We had a rain storm and it broke the next day, not happy at all."
4,Does the job,I needed to cool off my bedroom during the hot summer months. Works well. Easy to install.I would recommend this fan.
4,Does the job,"I put this in my bedroom window when it's cool out at night and not hot enough inside to put the A/C on. I'm not going to get into scientific comparisons with other fans. It fits in the window, the fan is powerful enough and it has a thermostat. It's not going to cool a whole house instantly. What do you really expect from a small plastic fan? I'd buy another if I needed one."
5,great fan,"Works great, easy installation, not to loud. It is just what I wanted. The only thing I would change would be if you could run one fan without the other."
5,Wonderful effective fan,I already have one of these fans and bought another to replace an inefficient fan (not Holmes brand) that I bought a long time ago. It fits well in the window and provides air exchange on summer nights when a cool breeze is needed. I don't like air conditioning and this fan is perfect for cooling off a room!
4,Holmes HAWF2043 Twin Window Fan,"Mostly satisfied with this product. Works fine, but has no specific off switch. You control the off/on with temperature buttons. Materials in the fan are fine but, there is no easy way to take apart for cleaning blades, etc. I find that appliances last longer if they are able to be cleaned regularly."
4,On The Devil's Court,"My book is called On The Devil's Court.The author of this book is Carl Deuker. This book is a cross between fantasy and realistic fiction.Joe is a 17 year old red head that is tall and only passion is basketball. His dad is a really smart scientist. Joe's dad wants his son to be like him and go to stanford with straight a's but Joe doesnt want to. Joe moved from Boston with a promise from his dad to beable to go to a public school. Joe meets some friends like Ross, he goes to a public school that Joe wants to go to. Joe and Ross get in a lot of trouble togather and Joe gets caught by his parents so they force him to go to a private school. Joe wants to fit in so he sells his soul to the devil so he can be good at basketball. His team makes it to the state championship against the public school team who has Ross, who had become his worst enemy, on it.I really liked this book. I think it is appropreiate for middle schoolers and up."
4,Review for On the Devil's Court,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It grabbed my attention right off the bat and didn't let it go. I enjoyed the basketball game passages a lot. They were very well written and had a lot of depth and suspense. The plot was a little corny, but Carl Deuker wrote the story well enough that it wasn't that big of a deal. I enjoyed how the main character handled his situation. The end of the story was enjoyable as well.The story is that a high school basketball player moves to Seattle and has to start school with very few friends. He starts the basketball season and one day while doing some individual practice, decides to make a bargain with the Devil. ""Give me a full season of power and my soul is yours.""The book will have you reading the struggle of a teenage boy through temptations, superstitions, and trying to find his place in a new city."
4,On the Devil's Court,"On the Devil's Court by Carl Deuker is and excellent book about a kid named Joe who loves basketball. He tells the Devil that he will give him his soul if he is the star of his team and the team goes undefeated. After he sells his soul to the devil, he wishes he hadn't because his team somehow keeps winning anyway possible. Close to the end of the story Joe's dad has two heart attacks, and Joe gets a concussion. At the end of the story Joe's team goes 24-0, and he keeps his soul. On the Devil's Court is an awesome book that makes you never want to put it down until you are finished."
1,Not worth your money,"I was not happy with this curling iron. I have thick hair, and it did not even make a dent in my hair. It does not get very hot, which is why it did not work on my hair. If you have thick hair I would not waste your money on this."
1,Do not buy!,"Vidal Sasson VS184C Gold Series Professional Three-Barrel WaverThis product is a waste of money, it overheats and smokes and burns out your hair. This product is a household hazard and do not recommend this to anyone!"
1,Meh,"I ordered the three-barrel waver iron after seeing it on ""The Real World."" And it's...ok. I was imaginging beautiful curls ala Jennifer Aniston at the Golden Globes and I got two weak little waves. They were barely better than a rubber band crimp!"
1,Luscious Curls?,"For some reason I was expecting a bit more of a curl. Instead, I ended up with a flashback to 4th grade and the crimping iron. This didn't give curls, it just crimps on a larger scale. I felt much like my parents' poodle after just a few sections. If you're looking for a wider crimped look, this is perfect. If you're looking for 'a head full of luscious curls' as advertised, you're out of luck."
1,Nice... if you want to look like a poodle!,"Ugh! I was excited to use this when I received it some years ago but was very disappointed with the results. The ""waves"" come out very unnatural looking, more like a cross between a crimp and a curl. In fact, I think I'd actually prefer using a crimper over this thing, if you can imagine that! Just very unflattering. The barrels' size is just much too thin and I think if it had a thicker barrel it might be nice. However, the iron only has 2 heat settings also, which is a big minus. If you have VERY thin, fine hair this might be OK (well, just not AS bad), but if your hair is normal or as thick as mine, DON'T EVEN TRY IT! I would go for the Revlon 3-barrel Jumbo Waver over this (or something similar looking), which I think I'm about to try (the barrels seem alot thicker and better placed I think I could achieve the natural wavy look I'm trying for). But pass on this VS product."
3,Volume For Fine Hair,"I've always had fine, straight hair. In the 80s, I used perms to help, but I didn't want to fry my hair the rest of my life, so I looked for alternatives.I went through all kinds of styling tools fromRevlon RV261 20-Roller Ionic Professional HairsettertoConair CD103JCS Satin Finish 1-1/2-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron, and then some...even hair products like Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray Extreme 7 oz..I finally stumbled across this triple-barrel iron. While it takes much longer to style my hair, it doesn't fall flat after only a few hours...in fact, I've had my waves last overnight.I would not recommend it to someone who is in a hurry, or anyone with shoulder-length or shorter hair...if you don't have long hair, using this iron will make you look ridiculous."
4,Heaven sent.,"This works wonders on my straight, fine hair. Can be glamerous or funky. Only 4 stars due to the fact that it is difficult to master, but it is well worth the practice. Until you get the hang of it, it does make a really cute ponytail."
2,Difficult to use...,"I'm not sure if either I'm completely inept at doing my hair or this thing is just incredibly tricky to use. Nonetheless, the result that I've gotten has been very disappointing. I definitely wouldn't recommend this iron to someone who is not used to spending a lot of time on their hair and is very skilled at using all kinds of hair appliances. I think that this item will now sit in a closet never to be seen again..."
1,Waste of $$$,"I have long straight hair and was tired of the same old look. So I figured hang up the flat iron and get me a 3 barrel waver. Was so excited to achieve a different hairstyle than my usual without having to pull out the curling iron (and 1 1/2 hours). I ended up purchasing the VS waver due to the good price soon to find out that there is a reason that the price is so low- the thing doesn't work!!! It did nothing for my hair. It didnt give me waves at all. Nothing. I even tried holding it in my hair longer. But that didn't work either. Would put it in my hair and count to 30 before moving it and if anything it made my hair frizz at that point. I do not recomend this for anyone that does not have hair that is just super easy to curl. Because chances are, unless your hair takes to heat REALLY well, this will do nothing for you but add to your day's frustration and damage your hair."
1,"ummm, you can't ride the wave...","This is just like a crimper, and that, we already have. Not sure if a more expensive one would do the trick or not but I am no longer interested."
1,Frizz-a-palooza,"I used a friend's triple barrel fancy curling iron. I got lovely clean waves that still left my hair shiny but gave me waves, like the bird in the Pantene ad who is wandering down the stairs. It was fab. This nonsense made my hair frizzy and didn't really give me waves but a really ugly ball of mess.All in all, it was pretty rubbish. Don't recommend it. Another bloody hair implement destined for the basket of no use!"
1,Depends on your hair type...,"I have really thick, hard to curl, dry, asian hair. This iron did not work for me at all. The iron did not get hot enough to do anything. I guess it would work if I did small one-inch sections, but I have so much hair, it's just not worth the time. The waves it did create were fizzy and ugly.My friend, who has thin hair, uses this iron all the time and it works great.I recommend the Hot Tools Deep Waver. It worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves."
3,Master Unremastered,"While this album brought back memories I was hoping to hear CD-quality, remastered works to recapture and decorate Mr Shirley's voice and music. On that front, I was very disappointed. However, Mr Shirley's showmanship and theater remains a shining testament to those ""good old days"" when my uncle Jerry entertained, the numerous weddings, christenings, funerals, birthdays, and the countless 'blues' dances I experienced. Thank you Mr Shirley, you are indelibly part of my life. You're magic! :o)"
3,Entertaining if flawed,"This was the first book I read about the case-after reading several others I certainly don't support the conclusion-that Elizabeth Morrow ""did it"" in a fit of rage;nor, due to lack of documentation, will many others. That being said, it is a very entertaining and lively read and serves as a quite good primer for the actual story and sequence of events. It will be noted by students of the case that the scenario shares many of the elements of the hypothesis that I do buy, put forth by Ahlgren & Lemonier in Crime of the Century, that the coverup angle resulted from Lindbergh's role in the killing. Again, entertaining & hopefully will lead readers to further inquiry/investigation"
3,Tools.,"Very handy tool but after a two month it fell from the 2 fit and broke down the slider to control the direction. well, so just work good tool. Sorry ,but that part can""t change, is not possible. thank you. Buy but do not drop."
3,Roots of Trance,"Indeed, this is Indian music - Bengali, to be precise. The fortunate inclusion of lyric summaries for all the tracks helps guide the listener through performances that would otherwise be repetitive, despite the muscular musicianship and full-throated singing. I recommend this to fans of Qawwali or of any other vocal/percussion ""trance"" genre."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"Given his ""Real Sugar"" disk, I guess I expected more of the same. Not true. This is genuine Indian music with Indian instruments and all the rest. If that's what you want, this might be a fit. One aside, there is clapping from the live audience in some cuts. Well, audience... maybe 5 or 6 people."
3,Klein's Naturals Raisin Nut Trail Mix,"The ingredients are great, but the mixture was a little salty for my tastes. I washed the trail mix in a collender in the sink, then dried it out on a cookie sheet in the oven, and now it's great. If too salty is an issue, this step will help."
3,decent but not disappointing,it is what it is... it didn't disappoint but it didn't wow me either. the product arrived damaged and customer service was great. they satisified me with a credit on a future purchase which was fine since it wasn't a severe problem. for the money it is just fine...
3,"Beautiful songs, bad voice","Agustin Lara was a great composer and pianist. His voice is just not at the same level. If you like his songs, you might be better off by buying Los Panchos, Pedro Vargas or any of the many talented voices that interpreted his beautiful songs. Also, the recordings are old, and digital cleaning can only do so much."
4,A Perfect Balance,"Burmese Design and Architecture by Johni. Falconer, et al, offers a perfect balance between excellent photography and enlighting commentary, which together bring alive the splendor of Burmese, Mon, Arakan and other architectural styles.Certainly a recommended book for the Southeast-Asia enthusiast!"
4,Very interesting but not representative,"I think it's a very interesting book, architecturally. But as a Burmese person myself, I don't recognize most of the architecture as being from Burma. I think they are definitely Burmese influenced but I wonder who in Burma can really afford to have that built, and most rich people in Burma don't really live in those kinds of homes. In any case, I am sure there are some that do and then, those that aren't in Burma, I think it's great they use the Burmese elements in their buildings."
2,Mini Cabbage Patch Doll,I thought it was going to be a little bigger than it was. It's actually smaller than a barbie doll.
4,Relatively inexpensive and it works well.,"I bought this stapler a few years ago when I was running some indoor/outdoor carpet down some wooden stairs (a perfect application for the rounded staples). I have since used this gun for many projects - inluding wire tacking and various other projects using both the rounded and square type staples. I have not had a bit of trouble with jamming and this gun seems to have enough force to drive stables into any type of wood construction material. Also, I paid less for this gun at a local hardware store than it is listed for here (sorry Amazon!)Highly recommended!"
1,Jam - A - Matic,"What a hunk of junk. I purchased this gun to drive 7/16 T25 staples and was greatly dissapointed in its performance. In a half hour of use I had to clear close to 15 jams from the stapler. I was using arrow staples so it wasn't a fastener issue.To clear jams one must use a phillips screwdriver and a small (9mm?) wrench just to dissasemble the gun. This in itself is a pain, but the inability of the unit to fire more than 5 staples without a double-feed or complete jam is unacceptable. I would avoid this gun at all costs. A poorly made dual purpose stapler that should never have been brought to market.If you are looking for a unit that shoots T25 staples get the Arrow T25p. It is a good tacker that runs reliably."
1,Waste of money,"I urgently needed staple gun to run network and phone cable, picked up with box of Arrow staples.Thought it was a great price for a Arrow stapler that I could tack cable with.Now I know why it was only like $20. Multiple jams, require taking gun apart.Couldnt get tacks to stick in anything, like it didn't have the power to drive them in.Didn't make much different what setting I had it on for depth.Will look for a different model. This one goes in the trash."
1,Worthless,"Jammed after first use. Only used 10 staples. I downloaded manuel but wasn't even able to unscrew bolt to clear out the chamber. Home Depot employee pointed it out to me, so I thought he knew the best brand. May be the cheapest brand. Will never buy arrow product again if they can't produce something this simple."
1,Totally Useless,"I purchased this staple gun in order to do some very light work, running ethernet along the baseboards of a rental unit. I was driving the smallest staple type into soft woods. I used genuine Arrow T25 rounded-crown staples. Power was ample to the task.Unfortunately, this staple gun really does jam on every second or third staple. It took me three hours to do 15 minutes of work. I think my record was getting through five staples without a jam.I should have spent the extra $10 for a dedicated round-crown staplegun and not messed with this dual-purpose thing."
1,Jam Machine,"Bought this to tack christmas lights to some trees. When it worked, worked great and you can't beat the price. Mine jammed every 20 staples or so, however, just like many other reviewers. This ""Jam-proof mechanism"" discussed on the packaging seems to be an invention of the marketing department.Seemed to work better with a fresh sleeve of staples, once it got about halfway used up the jamming started, and it was worse when holding the gun at odd angles. This thing jams so often I actually replaced the hex nut at the back with a wing nut so I could take it apart easier to clear jams.Going to buy a better model for next year."
4,Maybe You're Holding It Wrong?,"I'd give this 5 stars except it has stuttered a few times. I've never had to disassemble anything to get it back on track though. I have routed hundreds of feet of phone wire with it and if it wasn't working very well, I guess I'd try a T-25. Usually if it doesn't want to shoot, I just fire it in a safe direction at the ground a couple times and it's OK. Maybe there is a QC issue that lets some sloppy tolerances through but mine is a keeper. I've only shot round back staples and in a couple different lengths. I appreciate the concave nose that helps me straddle a wire and out of many hundreds of shots I've only pierced a wire a couple times. In some contorted positions it can be hard to get enough leverage to fire it but then I just try a little harder. A cordless electric with collated coated staples would be nice (and probably expensive)."
2,"Ordered in November, deliver estimate February to March!","Ordered this and another magazine through amazon on November 15. Been waiting and wondering and finally remembered to check and find out what is going on. According to Amazon, I can expect to start receiving these sometime between mid-February to mid-March.This is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous. I will never order another magazine through Amazon given the horrible turnaround time. I could have got it for the same price elsewhere - went through amazon for the ""convenience"" which turns out to be illusory."
3,Not Bad,"I loved the beginning and was sucked into the story. After that, however, it bogged down for me. I liked the premise, but the story just moved too slowly. I used to read a lot of her novels as a youngster and enjoyed them. Maybe the era changed and now I want faster stories. Personally, I think she's better as a full-blown SF author."
3,"Original story, cardboard characters","The beginning of the story is pretty well-worn by now, but keep it in historical context. A man is transported to another world which is more suited to him than this one. Of course, the world is a magical one. Mix that character in with another classic character concept: the unwilling bride-to-be, donning men's clothes and miraculously being able to pass as a young man, while travelling under the guise of a fighter.This would all be bad enough, but the characters themselves are so lackluster as to make the entire thing boring. I was interested in the unwilling bride, up to the point where she escaped the castle, and then she faded right back into the background.Norton's work is characteristically this way, and one die-hard fan said she read the books for the story, not the characters."
5,Love this book -- wish there was a kindle version,I love this book -- the beginning of the Witch World series. I have the paperback of it and every other of the Witch World books I could lay my hands on. I just wish this one and all the others were available for the kindle. Her writing grabs me as no other fantasy author. Her writing is a treasure that needs to be preserved.
4,Good reading,"I have been looking for this book for a while. While on my annual retreat, the monks would read to us from this book during our meals. Glad I found found it."
3,"Good, but...",This is a great guide of Lectio Divina. I liked his survey of the Fathers of the Church as material for Lectio.
4,Scholarly and Thorough Treatment of the Practice of Lectio,"Father Casey's book is a thorough and scholarly walk through the history and contemporary significance of the practice of Lection Divina; almost too much so for the beginner who wishes to learn how to incorporate the practice into his/her prayer or meditation. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good treatise on the subject, albeit perhaps a little too regimented and ""monastic"" for me... for instance, his insistance that the practitioner of Lectio work their way slowly through one biblical book rather than attempt to target meaningful texts, strikes me as a little over-controlling; applicable to a serious monastic maybe, but for us regular folks who are just interested in deepening our practice, a gentler technique may be just as useful. A great book for beginning inquiry into Lectio is S. Thelma Hall's ""Too Deep For Words""; then tackle this book as you investigate more deeply."
5,Best book on the subject - easily!,"This should be the number one ""go to"" guide for learning the ancient practice of lectio divina. Why? Casey gets to the point about what true lectio divina practice involves, the difficulties in sustaining a true practice, and how to maintain a regular practice that will promote spiritual transformation. As Casey says, authentic lectio divina is a direct encounter with God's Word, not a whimsical search for good advice or inspiring anecdotes. There's any number of ""feel good"" books on the market if that's what you're after. Rather, authentic lectio is literally stepping into world of Spirit where self-honesty and surrender are everything."
5,"Hi, Pizza man",I love this book!! It is a very simple but a very cute story. This book is perfect for a pizza theme and kids love it!
4,Not as good as Volume 2,"For me, Volume 1 was more a rework of classic tango songs than anything. There were some nods to classic chillout vibes, but not as much as volume 2. Put 1 and 2 on scramble and it's a good balance."
5,Product review,I find the toshiba laptop which i bought from amazon to be be of good quality and worth the money.
4,Surprise !,"Most albums with ""kitchey"" titles are not too good. This one is an exception. If you have any interest in the hill-country style of Mississippi, then this is a great sampler. I was turned on to this sound by the North Mississippi AllStars, and wanted to hear more. Some of these artists are not around any more, so soak it up while you can."
3,Hours Of Holiday Watching!,"Hours Of Holiday Watching!That is the best thing I can say about this. From the old classic TV shows to very strange and forgotten Holiday movies of old - there is a lot to see on this DVD collection!Most everything on here is fun and some quite good. However the production value is that of its original broadcast or film quality. The video tapes of the original broadcast would never hold up to the digital quality we have now with HD and more.They compiled many Holiday Themed obscure TV shows, commercials and movies and made a really good comprehensive collection of some of the most extremely classic celebrities, performers and actors in the Holiday Theme.Great deal for the price - just don't expect much in the quality department. The DVD's are fine - its just these are the original broadcasts that go back to the early 50's and the quality of TV back then was very scarry!I enjoyed this collection - most of the time. 3-26-09"
3,great collection,"Some of the stuff here (and there is plenty) is good in an archeological sort of fun way. The cartoons are pretty bad. None are funny but little kids might enjoy them for their Christmassy themes. The movies are a hit and miss bunch that no one has ever seen--for good reason. But the greatest saving grace is the Mexican movie Santa Claus--the worst movie ever made. It begins with truly obnoxious children singing songs from every country for an unendurable amount of time and then somehow goes to outer space and ends up in Hell. It is a laugh riot for afficionados of egregious filmmaking. I highly recommend this set. I have yet to watch the Yule Log disc, but the rest is well worth the inexpensive price."
1,Poor Quality,"I was very excited about this collection of nostalgic Christmas programs because my family has been watching many of them year after year on my father's aging projector. It was definitely time to take a step up in technology. However, neither of the DVDs in this collection would play on the DVD player. We were able to get them to play on our computer, but the video production was of such poor quality, we would be better off watching them on reel-to-reel. The vids look like someone copied them to DVD from a VHS tape. Because they are not mastered, the sound differs from one vid to the next. Some videos froze and others skipped.When I requested a refund from Amazon, they were happy to oblige and said that I needn't bother returning the DVD collection. That should tell you something about the product quality when Amazon doesn't want to be bothered with restocking it."
3,Get what you pay for,"Since this was the only version of this product I could find on internet at time of purchase, it was satisfactory, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. (The shu eumura version is much better, but no longer available.) This one requires that you fill a flimsy unattached, plastic insert that falls out every time you open the compact, and has a miniscule lip brush that falls out just as often. However, the mirror is nice and big, covering the whole top cover."
3,Smaller than expected,"Even when it is very convenient I find it really small, you can only store a tiny amount of lipstick on each square. And is really difficult to do it mess free."
5,Japonesque Lipstick Palette...,"I LOVE my lipstick palette by Japonesque. It it sturdy and it does just what I need it to do...hold the lipstick from my tubes when it gets too low to put on directly from the tube, and once I put the last bits of my favorite lipstick in the palette kit, I am saved from having to buy a new tube of lipstick right away...it saves me money!!!"
1,[Not what I was expecting!!],I have owned this machine for approximately one year. It is a poor design with [inexpensive] construction. I highly recommend avoiding the purchase of this machine. If you have received one as a gift send it back - you will regret keeping the machine.
2,Scholl textbook,I was required to purchase this book for a class I am taking. It would not have been my first choice if I was just purchasing it for a reference book.
3,Something to Smile About,"I think that My Own Worst Enemy is a great song. I love the tones of their voices throughout the whole song. Also, Miserable great track, the surprised look on everyone's face when they hear it for the first time. Very real. Sorry to say NYC radio stations don't play enough of them. Keep up the good work!"
3,A disappointment,"While there are some standout stories (Thomas Tessier, Nina Hoffman, Joe Hill), there are also some clunkers. One author appears to think that ""Van"" is Van Helsing's first name, and many others appear to have little to do with Van Helsing other than having his name appended (a few don't even bother with that, and merely present generic vampire hunter stories).Extremely uneven."
3,Beware of Advertising,Sales add describes this product as a 1 gallon container. It is actually 0.8 U.S. Gallon (3.0 Liters). With that in mind you can buy the 0.8 gal size cheaper else ware.
3,Show fair,"The show has some very good moments, some is more social commentary rather than entertainment. OK, but not as good as I had hoped."
4,AMAZINGLY EXCELLENT!,"This book really potraits the different sides and things that teenagers go trough. I got this book from a friend of mine and I totally fell in love with this book. As a teenager, it is a very great book to read and see other people like you with their own little problems."
3,Whats in a name?,"I rate this book a 3 because it was good, but it wasn&#65533;t the best book I have ever read. The plot is about a town called Scrub Harbor. The rich people in the town want to change the name to Folly Bay. The other non-rich people want to keep the name Scrub Harbor. The Characters in the story are equal so there are no main characters. The theme of this story is to believe in something and fight for it. The setting is obviously in Scrub harbor/Folly Bay. The story is in the time period of the present. I liked this story."
5,The Sizzle of the Imperceptible and the Perceived,"In the electrically lyrical and hauntingly meditative prose-poems of Reproductions of the Empty Flagpole, Eileen Tabios is ""always drawn to the imperceptible,"" to aporias, abstentions, and disappearances, and to the lack in appearances, such as flags and mirrors, as well as the sizzle of the richly perceptible: ""A golden spark glints from a cufflink struck by a sun ray."" A poet who ""can be"" herself ""only in exile,"" who hovers over ""alien lands that are impossible to be grasped,"" Tabios seizes myriad answers to the question, ""How far will I descend for love?"" Sidestepping and sideswiping the tyrannies of fixed identity, this postcolonial poet, one who ""deconstructs rainbows,"" can help her readers feel ""Michelangelo's slaves surge out of stone"" as she shouts, ""The King is dead! Long live us all!"""
4,Good Book!,"I enjoyed this book! I mean if you can protray a male hairstylist as a drop dead gorgeous hunk of a man, well lets just say you've got my attetion!"
5,Hurry up and Write More,"I have both of the Commercials albums and was lucky enough to see them live a few months ago on tour. Although I liked both of these albums, which are fully of energy yet melodic, the new material they played on tour is light years ahead in their song writing abilities. I heard the new CD is coming out early summer. I can't wait to get it, as I had a chance to preview it when they played live. Easy to hear some influences, yet they are in a category all their own. Thanks Commercials, keep touring and don't forget to come back to NYC!"
2,end blows,"We continue our journey with Slith and Kang and the newly born female Draconians. The story is somewhat predictable. The plot does not really start to take off until the end of the book. The end itself is rather pathetic, it leaves a ton of unanswered questions, as if the authors wanted to write a 3rd book but just never got around to it. I paid 1.65 for this book, used on Amazon, it is probably worth about a buck less than that."
1,Lo Mejor de lo Mejor,"I have never received this item, so I cannot rate it. Can you please check on the status/thanks,emilia salinas"
1,Hipper than thou,"Oh dear.I realize he has an international reputation, but this is still second generation, second-rate Beat poetry. One can hear the bongo drums playing when reading it. I am sorry but writing ""deep"" lines of prose chopped up into lines on the page is NOT poetry...it is still just hackneyed prose chopped up into lines on a page. There is no music here, just an attempt to be hipper than thou."
5,"Informative, Professional, and very Straightforward","This is a great video for those who are new to the scene or need a few extra pointers at the intermediate level. Nico shows you several ways you can grow based on your income and depending on where you live rural/city/suburban. Nico tours professional grows and explains how they manage to grow 10+ pound trees as well as confined rooms where its manageable for the single person. Everything from what soil is used, nutrients, cloning, harvesting, lighting, growth rate, installation, varieties, biology and much much more. Everything that's needed to know in a 2 hour experience"
5,Excellent information 5 stars,This is for anyone interested in making there own medicine !Honestly one of the best videos i Have ever seen on the subjectI highly recommend this DVD because of its vast information complete step by step instructions.Another product for addition info is from Jorge Cervantes grow bible has the best wealth of knowledge on producing your own meds!
2,MIssing chapters!! Il manque des chapitres!!!,"This Kindle edition is missing 5 chapters that are included in most print editions of this book. I discovered this the hard way, while teaching the novel, when my students told me they had 5 chapters in their print edition that I had not read.List of missing chapters:La ToutouqueLe manteau de SaphiPrintemps passéLa couseuseLa noisette creuse"
1,just okey,"There are lots of slots but design flaw; they all run the length of the wallet, meaning small card like business cards fall into never never...the slots that dont go the length of the wallet are too small to hold business cards..there is no place for business cards..what a disaster!!"
2,Overpriced and not very good at all,I bought this having had very good experience with another Capresso product. It was a mistake. Very difficult to estimate the amount of coffee that you are grinding and the coffee sticks to the plastic container on account of static electricty. The coffee container quickly cracked.I would not recommend this to anyone. Mine is sitting repacked in the cellar.
2,don't buy it,"I bought the Capresso after reading reviews at this site, to replace an old KitchenAid machine that lasted 25 years. The Capresso quit working yesterday, after 14 months. Just cold quit, no warning. I finally took it apart to see what happened, and it appears that one of the two field coils on the motor has burned out. We have used this grinder in a domestic environment, grinding enough beans for two people in the morning, more or less each day since we got it. This hardly qualifies as hard use. While it was working, it did a good job with the grind, although as other reviewers have noted, it is extremely noisy, difficult to clean, and a bit awkward to use. I could (and did) deal with all of that, but there is no excuse for a burned-out motor after 14 months of use. Caveat emptor."
1,is the opposite of a star a black hole?,"This does not deserve even one star, so I will give it five black holes, as that's as close as I can come to the opposite of a star. The automatic shut off stopped working after five days. The grinder, after about one month, sounds as if it is ready to go at any time, pumping at about half speed. This is a piece of junk."
3,Messy,"I've used this grinder for almost a year. It does a really good job of grinding the beans. However, I've finally had it. It is impossible to remove the plastic holder without getting freshly ground coffee on the counter top. Every morning I have to clean the grounds off the counter. So this one is on its way to Goodwill."
3,Nice Product (good enough but not great),"This coffee grinder is loud and somewhat messy. But I still like it. I like that you can select the grind you want, hit a button and walk away. My opinion is also influenced by the great coffee this machine helps make. I've also come to like the noise -- the whirr is now a part of my morning routine.The catch bin is the biggest drawback. It's molded to suit the styling of the machine and has sharp corners. This is a drawback because it makes it difficult to get all of the ground coffee out with a scoop or a spoon."
4,"nice, but....","After wandering through pages and pages of reviews for coffee grinders, Capresso seemed to always get mentioned as good machine. The model 553 grinds wonderfully, but knowing how many whole beans to put in the hopper is tough to guess. Once you hit the button to start grinding you either have to let all the beans grind until the hopper is empty or interrupt the grinding by turning the power switch off. A preset amount switch would be much easier and less wasteful. I've learned just to turn off the power switch when I get enough grinds which is kinda dumb considering how well the rest of the machine is built and performs. If I had to do it again, I might have looked at the big brother which has presets and a hopper you can store beans in."
2,"Technically works okay, but...","This grinder technically works as designed, but it makes a huge mess. There is no good way to get the coffee out of the coffee container. Also, it is very, very loud."
2,"Pretty, but not practical","I bought this coffee grinder because it was an adjustable burr type grinder ans it was on sale at the time. It looks great on the counter top, but the ground coffee container is an odd shape. It is not easy to remove from the unit either. The two grooves on the front is the handle. It is also easy to drop the lid into the ground coffee container due to its shape. It is pretty but it is a messy and impractical design."
3,Burr Grinder,"This grinder is very loud and noisy when grinding the coffee beans. Yes, the grind is fine and the coffee takes good but the grinder is way too loud."
2,"Messy, messy, messy!","Product functions well but creates an incredible mess on your counter as you try to transfer ground beans to coffee maker. The ground bean reservoir is hard to remove from the grinder, ground coffee spills everywhere when you remove the top of the reservoir, grounds spill outside the coffee maker filter, grounds are left in the reservoir, ground coffee everywhere! But if you're a slob at heart & don't mind a mess, and want a good buy on a burr grinder, this one's for you!"
4,Very nice but...,"We recently upgraded to this burr grinder after years of using a blade type grinder. The quality of our coffee improved dramatically. More flavor, more aroma. The grinder does a great job. My only complaint is that the opening at the top of the receptacle that holds the ground coffee is long and narrow making it very difficult to get the grounds into the coffee maker without spilling grounds all over.Messy, but the quality of the grind makes it worth the hassle."
1,incredibly poor product,We purchased this based on earlier positive reviews. We made a mistake. The grinder is incredibly noisy (the loudest we've had)and the automatic shutoff stopped working within six weeks. We returned it to Capresso and they took two weeks to repair it. There are far better burr grinders than this one.
2,Good until now,"I purchased this coffee grinder after reading numerous reviews of all the grinders Amazon offered. For the price I expected more. At just over a year old, with normal use (we grind a months worth at one time), the automatic shutoff no longer works and the unit doesn't ""sound"" right anymore. After every use we dusted and cleaned it completely. It worked great until about that one year mark. This was our first coffee grinder; and we've found that it depends on the type of coffee as to whether you can contain the mess. Some coffees appear to be ""dryer"" than others. Overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean. I wouldn't recommend this grinder, and I'll be shopping for a different brand and style that may contain the grounds better and actually last longer."
2,This thing is great for a day or two,"Only reason I gave it a 2 star is because i got it half priced. This thing grinded enough for a total of 5 espresso's at fine setting. Then only 2 drip pots before going completley out. It just totally stopped in the middle of the grind and smelled like burnt plastic. Although I could have gotten it replaced, I simply put it where it belonged, with the other broken junk in my trash compacter. And thats that."
3,Nice but...,Grinds coffee perfectly (if you know how to set it--still trying) but it so messy. Maybe there is a way to get the coffee out without spilling it all over but I haven't figured out a way yet.
3,"Not bad, but a little messy","This is a good grinder, but it's a little messy. Read the instructions before you use it otherwise you may not get the results you are looking for."
1,Messy to the point of useless,A prefect example of a product design group that never used the product they designed! Messy is an understatement. Should come with an attached vacuum cleaner. Don't see any difference compared to a $20 blade grinder. This one is going in the garbage.
2,Lot of background noice,"The selections of the compilation are core treasures of Carlos Gardel. Unfortunately, there is background noice (sometimes harsh and irritating) in this compilation. It has not been remastered at all to remove at least the harsh sounds."
3,"""Historical Sketch""","This album is a beautifully executed collection of folk songs from the 1800s and a few new ones written in the style. That's its beauty and its curse, because in its mission to stay within the boundaries of the style, the record unfortunately becomes more of a historical sketch than a vital piece of music for current listeners. Imagine Woody Guthrie folk tunes or maybe your father's 78s if they were digitally remastered.I'm finding it hard to be passionate about the album, in other words. On the other hand, those who get passionate about, say, Civil War battle re-enactments, are going to love this record.Oh, and by the way, I really loved the book, ""Cold Mountain."" It was more three-dimensional than the record, in my opinion."
4,Liquid Mind VII,"Excellent used CD, but poor packaging resulted in a broken case. The CD is perfect, but poor packaging. Luckily I had a spare case."
5,Most relaxing album ever?,"I have several of Chuck Wild's ""Liquid Mind"" albums and though it can be said they are similar, ""Reflection"" is by far my favorite. The songs are the usual slow, slow, SLOOOOWWW tempo that is designed to trigger your brain alpha waves and then lead you into deeper sleep. The songs are somehow a bit prettier on this album.I like to put my earbuds on, set this to play for about 20 minutes and take a catnap whenever I feel stressed. I also like to drift off to sleep at night to this album or to the album that followed this oneLiquid Mind VIII SLEEP. I'm not personally a fan of sleep aids of the pharmaceutical kind and this really works for me.Do not play this while driving. I'm serious; it will make you doze off."
3,ok massage music,"It's a little slow and boring for my taste, but it provides for constant airy sound. Typical spa music."
5,Great Scale For the Money.,... Easy to program and very accurate. Would recommend it for anyone watching their weight and body fat %.
4,"Good, but familiar","This dvd follows a few of the strippers at Scores and outlines the familiar stuff of why they strip...what they do to stay in shape...how their families feel about their job...so on and so forth. If you've seen one documentary on strippers, you've pretty much seen it all, and this sentiment is true of this dvd also. There's just nothing new here for those of us who've been in the business or around it. I think this video would appeal to people who are looking to find out about strippers and what they do, but if you're looking for pure stripping action, you'll have to find other performance tapes."
3,Helpful if you already know the moves,"This video was actually pretty good. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who hasn't already done a fair amount of Taekwondo, as the moves are not explained, it is purely about the poomse. But if you are working towards grading or advancing for your own pleasure, this video is very helpful."
3,The view from above.,"This is what I have always wanted to be able to see. A view of mother earth and her cities, country's landscapes, that I would have never seen otherwise in my life. My disappointment however is that I have never been able to find an overhead view dvd of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, that would be worth the effort and time to watch it. Take the ad like commercialism out of such a product. I would pay a thousand bucks or more for such a product from one end to the other of that canyon and river, that which I could watch over and over for the rest of my life (now 81)."
4,Good Cookbook,Very good on giving an introduction on many modeling techniques.Exceptionally recommended for the new babe.
4,"HMMM, We didn't discuss this at KFBS","Fascinating work. Should be used in a course at your local B-school. Sit down, read it and enjoy, you may learn something that you will use one day."
4,Good for refreshing your finance concepts,"This book is good for refreshing your finance concepts. It simply describes how to use excel to calculate existing finance concepts and models, which should not be new to people who ever take finance courses. Not really useful for people searching for advanced financial knowledge. Some minor errors can still be found in the second edition."
2,"""OK"" for a beginner, but not for the Corporate World",I am a business analyst. This book doesn't have models that I have used in the business world. The example models are very basic in form and execution. There is no way that I would show the CFO these models. There are a few interesting pages. I will keep the book on my shelf for a reference.
3,"Ambitious topics, frequent errors","The book tackles some pretty sophisticated topics and tries to present them in a simple, logical manner. However, there are a large number of errors and inconsistencies that make some of the examples difficult to follow."
5,Strongly recommended to practitioner,The book has great practical value. It also applies to those who wish to implement financial models in other computing environment than Excel.
5,A very useful book in the practice of Financial Management,"Thank you for your very excellent text on financial analysis. I found the writing excellent and the examples very useful in developing models. I will be using the specific subjects of ""Financial Statement Modeling"", ""Valuation Analysis"" and ""Lease Analysis"" in my practice. I congratulate you on a well written and documented book. I would very much like further discussion on the calculation of terminal value in chapter 2, page 30....Again, thank you for a most excellent tool. I will continue to use this text in my future work.Steve Schroder"
5,Great Textbook for Intro. to Financial Modeling,"This textbook is a wonderful introduction to financial modeling. The sections covering fixed income and option modeling give the reader a sense of how to translate financial theory into practice. As a participant in the financial markets and employee of a private investment firm, I find this book to be a resourceful reference tool."
1,NO PIERDA SU DINERO,"Ordene este disco, porque tengo parte de su produccion en los viejos discos de vinilo, pero que sorpresa tan desagradable, la calidad de este CD esta muy por debajo de mis discos de vinilo. La compañia que lo edito no hizo ningun esfuerzo por eliminar el ruido de las viejas producciones, por ejemplo el disco numero 18 (Pierrot) del CD 1 no se puede oir, asi que si quiere perder su dinero ordene este disco. Lo que lamento que que siendo Juan Arvizu un excelente cantante que fue llamado en su epoca ""el tenor de la voz de seda"", lo que se oye es una voz llena de ruido.Si la escala de estrellas lo permitiera, me clasificacion seria 0 estrellas."
5,Great product!,Product came in exactly as described and installation was an ease. This chainring is great for one speed cruiser bikes if you're riding in hilly terrain.
4,Awesome,I love this DVD. It really puts me in the mood for the holidays. I don't have a fireplace so it is a nice way to get that holiday feeling with a fire.
1,"Right on, Mr. Arcuri!","I'm from the Bronx, and was eleven when the WPIX Yule Log made its debut, on a great kid's tv station. I feel sorry for anyone who didn't grow up in New York at that time and doesn't have the WPIX Yule Log registered in their Christmas memories. Thank you Mr. Arcuri for slamming down this impostor."
4,Quality of the Christmas Yule Log Fireplace,"We also have this product on VCR tape. The tape is not as clear as the DVD, but the DVD is much darker than the tape. We kind of like our tape a little better. Of course, the DVD has nice features the tape doesn't have since we can play it with or without music."
4,A good over all album,"This is a well rounded album. It has 10 songs: 4 instrumental and 6 vocal. An exelent singer and weather its vocal or instrumental you crave you will get a great display of guitar. The only reason i gave it a 4 is because there are a few wierd things like in ""the beast"" you hear a voice in the beginning saying ""i am the supreme love maker.....i make love till someone dies!!"" I recomend it."
3,Good solo effort from a great guitar player,"Some self indulgent stuff, but a good album if your a fan of Dokken or Lynchmob. Surprise of this album while George was auditioning vocalists for this album he included tracks from Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple) and Nelson (yes Rickey Nelson's kids)"
3,Alot of variety,"Some tunes are better then others, and 2 songs sound the same.There is a variety of singers in each song, and some instrumentals.Some really good guitar work, but you probably wont enjoy all the songs."
1,a reviewer from massachusetts,"this cd could have been great,but with the exeption of the nelsons the vocals were awful.here it seemed george was finally aproaching satriani,vai,and michael harris territory,but isn't as good as any of them especially harris.the two instumentals love power from the mama head,and tiera delfuego,which is in antarctica were ok,but instead of a heavy metal instrumental cd,it was mostly experimental boring songs.wanted heavy metal,instead got the black gospel hour,and a 2 part song about beastiality,with a guy yelling and screaming.''TOO WEIRD FOR ME''."
3,A slight disappointment,"Radclyffe has become one of my favorite romance writers. I confess to being a little disappointed with this book. She never let me know Jude well enough to understand why, other than lack of time, she had avoided commitment. The childhood chess doesn't suffice. Other than that this is a good book, an easy read and a charming love story."
3,Good but lacking a little,"I liked the premise of the story and I liked the way that she developed the characters. But after reading other reviews that made the author seem amazing, I was really disappointed in how it read like a bad romance novel from time to time. I know that it is a romance novel, but I expected it to be less cheesy than it actually was and that got to me a little."
4,Real Good Book that is Romantic!,"I read two Radclyfe books back to back. This one I liked a lot. It was romantic, and the characters seemed real (unlike Shadowland which wasn't good at all). This author is new to me, but I will read more if the books are like this one. Her characters in this book were very real and very true to life. I would recommend this book to people who like a good story."
5,Very well written romance,"Any regular reader of lesbian fiction will be able to tell right away this is a book that is a step above the rest. Well written, engaging characters, fascinating medical setting, realistic, passionate romance, well edited--all in one book. We have become used to settling for some, but not all, of the elements which make up an excellent lesbian romance. With Radclyffe's books, one is never disappointed. I highly recommend this book and all of Radcylffe's books. Each is a pleasure to read--more than once!"
5,Authoritative work,"Some people don't like the idea of a priest writing a book about Cheyenne myth and ritual. Too bad for them. Who better to understand it than one who is completely accepted by the Cheyenne people and, indeed, one of the holders of the sacred regalia of the Arrows and Medicine Hat? Peter Powell has done the world an undying favor by meticulously recording, with the utmost exactitude, in both words and pictures the sacred rites (and their meaning!) of the Cheyenne people? Ignore the reviews of those who just don't -or can't- get the point of this magistral work and instead buy it and enter into a magical world."
2,A Catholic Distortion of Cheyenne Culture,"Powell, a Catholic priest, has an agenda unrelated to the great mythic story of Sweet Medicine (Motseyoef in the Tsistsistas [Cheyenne] language; untranslatable in English), in which he has tried to blend the ancient indigenous spirituality of the proto-Algonquians with Christianity. Beginning only around 1830 with Suhtaio and Tsistsitas conflicts with the Pawnees and other Native Nations of the upper -trans-Missouri Basin, he doesn't even talk about Sweet Medicine, barely mentioning him and then going on to a standard replay of American history. It is a uninspired recitation of questionable information used to justify the missionaries converting the Indians to a better God and Civilization."
1,"A ""don't buy this book"" kinda Book","when I saw it's non-authenticity, I returned it for full credit. Fr. Powell has been duped!"
3,Seems Sturdy,"This looks to be a sturdy well made piece. The ""Made in China"" written on the side does bother me though. i have not pounded this into the ground. So we will see."
2,Can not review the copy,Can not review the copy as the top third of the screen is actually on the bottom and the VHS player controls does not have anything that allows me to try and fix whatever the problem is????? I have been sold a dud??????
3,Hmm...,"Good book, but it doesn't explain a lot of things. After reading it, I felt as if the author somehow missed the whole point. I know for a fact that many crop circles actually are man-made, but with fabricated crop circles, the maize gets broken in the process. With real crop circles (the phenomenon that hasn't really been totally explained yet) the maize is left bent to the ground but unbroken and the area is 'charged' (cell phones won't get reception inside them, electronic devices set on the ground no longer function, people feel tingling sensations while inside). The book was well written and the stories of the hoaxers were funny, but when I picked this book up, I was hoping to find an explanation for the real crop circles."
2,Both have some growing up to do,"It's pretty simple: Justice and Kelly are a typical Linz pair, and if you've liked her couples in general, you'll probably like them too.I didn't, partly because I found them both tremendously self-absorbed. Justice never once thinks of the family whose child he saved, or even of the child himself; he is too hung up in his own guilty dilemma. Kelly takes ages to even consider putting herself in her father's or sister's place, or even Justice's after he hurts her.Get over yourselves, folks."
5,GREAT CHARACTER - NEAT ROMANCE,"Justice Wilder, the oldest and 3rd of the Wilder brothers, to secumb to Love.Kelly Hart needs to be loved for herself. Most men take one look at her sister, blonde, luscious Barbie, and Kelly is history. Makes for in inferiority complex.Justice was dumped by Barbie, over 10 years ago, because he was a Marine first and a husband second. Well, Barbie needed to be the center of some man's universe. Silly girl.The attraction Justice felt for Kelly was not going to interfer with his Marine goals. He wanted his title ""Invincible"" back and to be back with his team.Actually he didn't know what hit him when he finally decided to look at other options.I loved the inclusion of his brothers, Joe and Mark, and an update of their lives - Now we look forward to brother, Sam's story next.Definitely recommended -- quite an enjoyable read."
3,Great until its early death,"I read the reviews, and took my chances purchasing this.I bought it July 26, used it about 5 times a week, and it died on Oct 2. I was hoping I would be the exception, and it would last - but like many warned, it burned out. However, while I had it, I loved it! I kept my packaging and receipt and hope that Target will return it or exchange it."
1,vidal sassoon hot air brush,"When I received this product in the mail I was very excited to use it. Unfortunately, after the first use of the product, I was very unsatisfied. The product turns on and off while I am using it, therefore making it defective. I contacted the seller and told them of this problem to try to receive a different one and they responded with that I would be responsible for all the shipping costs. After purchasing this thru that seller, I will never purchase another Vidal Sassoon product again and nothing thru that seller again."
1,Not Worth The Money,"I recently purchased the VS Sasson curling brush based on the reviews. I used it about 2 weeks, for a brief amount of time (just used to give a slight flip and fullness on top)and this morning there was a puff of smoke and it died completely. I have short hair so I certainly did not over work this product. I plan on contacting the company for a refund. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Does Not Last,"I have been using hot air stylers similar to this for several years. I was very impressed when I started using this one. My hair felt great. However, it only lasted two months. I usually use the Revlon styler, but I thought I would try something new. My advice is purchase the Revlon brand. They typically last over a year."
1,Don't buy this!!,"In the last year I've been through 2 of these things!! They worked great for about 3 months and then all of a sudden they started loosing power and then they made a popping sound and died. They both went the same way. I've tried to make contact with Vidal Sasoon to replace it, as of yet they have been very unhelpful. I bought the second one thinking i had just gotten a bad on the first time...it seems they all have the same problem."
1,Doesn't work for long,"The first one I purchased lasted about 2 weeks, then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working. Exchanged it for another one - it lasted about 3 weeks - then the same thing. Have now purchased a different brand. Would not recommend this product."
1,It was great while it lasted.,"I bought one and it worked great. At first it's hard to manuever because it's really hot, and the barrel's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot, but once you get used to it, it does a stellar job of straightening your hair. Around 6 months into using the straightner, the machine slowly overheated and died. Thinking I had a faulty model, I went out and bought a new one. Guess what ? A few months into THAT one, it ended the same way.So basically, not worth it."
2,Didn't work for long...,"Have had this less than two months and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times a week on slightly spritzed hair to tame the frizz. The thing died!! Did work great while it lasted.... Now trying a Conair, so keeping my fingers crossed."
4,vidal sassoon,"This one I have liked more than others. Since I use it everyday on my hair, the long life of the product doesn't usually last a very long time, which I hope it would. I love the heat levels to dry my hair, but most of all I love the cool level to lock in my style. I have thin short hair and these type of air dryer stylers have been important to me, especially with the cool setting. Although I wish would last a long time, I do hope they will continue to make this product available for a very long time, I would be lost without it."
2,Started Smoking,"I have purchased this same product three times. The first time it lasted about a year and then stopped working. I replaced it because I really liked the way it worked with my hair and the cost was less than $20. The second one lasted about six months, but I had traveled with it quite a bit and assumed it took a beating in my luggage. I bought my third one in October 2007 and it stopped working a few days ago. Actually, I don't know if it stopped working. Once the smoke alarm in my home went off, I unplugged the dryer, boxed it up and returned it to Amazon. It was really light puffs of smoke that I didn't even notice until the alarm went off. Just a warning, since it seems other reviewers have had the same problem."
2,Burned out!,"I bought 2 of these at the store 3 years ago and was so excited to find them here on Amazon so I bought 2 more. The previous ones lastd about a year with daily use, but the two I purchase on Amazon burned out within a month. The first one only lasted a week. Maybe a bad batch? I dont know but I don't think I will take a chance again. I am lucky to have kept an old one and have pieced together a working model. Beware! I'm out $40. Don't let this happen to you!"
1,I never got to use it.,The first time I tried this dryer it blew out as soon as I plugged it in. It started burning -- smoke came out. It was a total waste of time searching for this product and ordering it. I will never try another ionic hot air brush again. My advice is stick to the basics.
1,If only it worked,"I bought one of these and it worked for maybe two months. It wouldn't shut off and like the others have stated I had to unplug it. Next the ionizer element stopped functioning and I wasn't getting the frizz free results. I bought a second one and it didn't work for more than one day. Day one I was glad to have it back again and I worked like the old one but by day two it just stopped working in a puff of smoke. The motor apparently burned out. This time I had kept the receipt and the original packaging but I would like to have one like this that works. Sasoon, wake up, you almost had a good product here."
2,Not so hot,I have had this curling brush for a total of 4 months before the fan blew out and the burning element nearly burnt through base. I don't reccommend. It worked good for the four months but should be able to last longer that 4 months.
2,Great when it works...,I tried this product an initially loved it but after only 2 weeks of use it died. I returned it for another and in about the same time it died again. I have given up on it.
1,Defective Product,"I went through 3 of these in less than 2 months. After about 2-3 weeks of use, the first two dryers wouldn't shut off when the switch was placed in the ""off"" position; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off. The 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks. I definitely do not recommend buying this product."
1,good while it lasted... which wasn't long,"Initially I was so impressed with this product I bought a second one within a week, so I could have one at home and one at the gym. After 4 months, however, the first one refused to shut off. About 2 weeks after that, the other one burned out. I'm not willing to throw away money every few months on any product, so I won't be buying this, or anything else under the sassoon label again."
3,Great product... if only it lasted!,"I loved using this Ion Hot Air Brush... my hair looked soft and shiny... not frizzy. However, after two months of use, my brush would not turn off. I had to pull the plug each time I used it. I have short hair. No hair got inside the appliance. I called VS Sassoon and they are replacing it (after they receive this broken one). Should the new one break after a couple of months, I am just going to ask for my money back!"
4,"Scholarly, detailed...and rather interesting.","Gives history of relations between the Churches of England and Rome, from the beginnings until 1980 (i have the second edition, by Pawley and his wife). Annoying at times, because it assumes knowledge i don't possess (fluency in French, certain historical episodes), and because it sticks strictly to its purpose, refusing to be sidetracked by any of numerous tempting side paths. Nevertheless, a fascinating book, very detailed (at times), and clearly accurate (or a remarkable fraud) where it speaks. Slow reading, because of the detail and the convolutions of history."
3,an easy read,"Not O'Banyons best effort. This is the old hunky guardian-young orphaned ward story set in the colonies and england as the american revolution strikes. Good characters, not much depth,and certainly not a keeper."
4,Good Product,"Received this model as a Christmas present and have been using it for about four months. Like most electric razors, it takes a bit of time for your beard to adjust. This razor seems to have cut that 'adjustment time' almost in half. The built-in indicators are very usefull in terms of reminding you to charge or clean the device. Replacement screens are costly but probably not more so than comparable brands. Overall opinion: good product, average price, good-very good performance."
2,"Once the battery goes, the shaver is worthless","I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product. With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months. After that, it's time to either ship it to an 'authorized repair site' and incur a big fee or plunk down more cash for a new one.By the way, the battery bypass cord is useless if the battery dies. It can't bypass without some sustainable life in the battery so the shaver is dead when the battery goes. Not exactly what I'd call consumer friendly engineering."
1,Not for sensitive skin!,I bought one of these in January of this year. It was okay at first as long as I didn't use it every day. As the months went by I could use it less and less frequently. It causes red blotches and raw skin on my face. It is definitely not for men with sensitive skin. Now I use it for trimming exclusively. It's back to Braun for me.
1,Amazon - AMAGONE!,"I never had a chance to rate this item. I ordered the Remington MS3-4000 and was confirmed by Amazon, then I received an e-mail the next day from Amazon cancelling my order because THEY (AMAZON) made an error in their price, well why should Amazon punish me for their error. Any good business would sell it and eat the cost of their mistake because now they're just getting a bad reputation. Amazon shouldn't be in business if they're going to FALSE ADVERTISE. They lost me as a customer and I will pass the word around."
2,BEWARE - This inferior version misrepresents itself,"Despite being called The Complete Collection this set is 110 minutes shorter than the product of the same name sold by the BBC in the UK. Not only that but Volume One should be spread over 2 discs as in the UK but here 190 minutes are crammed on to 1 disc to save them a few pennies while delivering over-compressed video to the paying customer.Read the reviews for Volume Three to discover some of the fine acts that aren't included here but should be.Of course, I can't give it just 1 star because many of the performances are awesome and worthwhile."
5,this set is awesome is there more planned?,Love this set I remember seeing so much of it live and it's where I first saw Little Feat who I have been an ardent follower since. I hope the BBC plan to release more. We need to see Dr hook singing Sylvia's mother.
5,Herstory not history,Angela Y. Davis tells the story of women's blues during the 1920s and 1930s. She closely analyses lyrical content and sets the songs of the 'Classic' blues singers within a historical context of feminism. The text is brilliant to read. It is an exciting new (though written in 1999) way of conceptualising the political nature of women's blues.
3,Little dissapointed...,"As I love music of Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith & Billie Holiday,this book didnt open new ground for me at all.The author firmly concetrates only on interpretations of the song lyrics and I still dont know more about singers than I didnt know before.I agree with the reader who said that Billie holiday maybe wasnt the best choice for symbol of black feminism - Dinah Washington with her fierce temper was much closer to blues foremothers in spirit, than sado-masochistic Billie.This is the first time ever that I found all the lyrics from Ma Rainey & Bessie Smith songs at one place, so that is maybe the only brilliant thing about the book - everything else seems half-finished to me."
3,Research concerns,"I am a resident of Columbus, Georgia, the birthplace and hometown where Ma' Rainey was raised and died. It is from this premise that I will address this publication, especially since Ma' has surviving relatives. The data compiled on Ma' Rainey was not validated nor reviewed by her family prior to publication. If all of the researchers that have written about Ma', and those that are proposing to write about Ma' would come to Columbus, Georgia, they would have direct access to many primary sources on the subject."
5,Bought one....then bought another,"The remote is convenient. The thermostat works. It's relatively quiet. The exchange function with each fan going in opposite directions is more effective than expected. Easy to install and will be easy to store.One minor issue is that the thermostat is affected by the temperature of the air running through the unit more than the temperature of the room you are trying to control. It would be better to have the thermostat on a short cable that could be stuck to the wall, window, or just dangle below the unit. It would also be useful if there was an additional thermostat outside to sense when it is blowing warmer air in than is already inside.Still running after 4 summers of constant use."
5,Keeping cool at the lake,We now own three of these fans. We use them at our cabin as we prefer not to use air conditioning. They operate much quieter than standard window fans and the light sleepers really appreciate this feature. They haave a few more bells and whistles than needed but they are the best fans we've ever had.
1,Recall needed.,"This is the second fan I ordered. The first I returned after talking to their customer service people, because the thermostat was reading 90 in a 70 degree room. The replacement is doing the same thing. I really hated returning it and asking for a refund because aside from the temperature guage reading it really is a nice fan, moves a lot of air (bigger blades than most) quiet, and the remote control worked well. I ignored the other reviews here about this type of problem because I thought it was a one in a thousand situation. I was wrong."
1,Call back next year it's heater season,"I bought two of these. One of the fan on one of the units stopped working, it's seized. I called the support phone number on bionaires website and was told to call back next year, they didnt have any fans to replace my faulty unit with because it was ""heater"" season.WHAT A CROCK!"
1,It's Not All It's Creaked Up To Be,"Don't make the same mistake I did, and buy this fan.Not sure what the thermastat is reading for a temp, but it is not the real temp of the room."
3,So-So,"I have mixed thoughts about this item. Unlike most my thermostat seems to be working but I have another problem. One of the fans wouldnt spin until I helped it. Now it turns but doesn't spin true thus not providing the output as designed and causing a slight reverberating sound. This could have been caused by shipping. The item was packed well by Amazon but the product looks to take damage very easily. The fan does move a lot of air though so I still like it. I wouldnt recommend dropping this even on a carpeted floor from 3 feet high. To sum it upPros. Moves a lot of air, fits the window nicely, looks attractive. Price?Cons. Cheap construction, QA department needs to be fired or maybe the department should be created.You will be happy if you get the one that works."
5,Great bedroom fan,"This is a great fan for a bedroom or small apartment. It is whisper quiet and the remote allows you to change fan speed and direction without getting out of bed. It's thermometer and auto temp setting is an added convenience.It's a lot cheaper than an air conditioner and, as it is usually cooler outside when I retire, it's all I need."
4,Difficult to clean but bought a second one anyway,"I purchased this model to replace one I had acquired two years ago (same model). The previous one still worked, but the two grills and fan blades had become too dirty to clean properly. So my only complaint is you cannot remove the grills nor can you completely remove the back cover to get to the blades.Despite that drawback, I purchased the same model because it's one of the few window fans that can accommodate wide windows via extender panels. I had previously purchased three additional panels direct from the manufacturer.Overall it's good looking, relatively quiet and reliable."
4,Great with One Caveat,"These are terrific window fans - quiet and reliable. We now have six of them deployed throughout our home. It's not air conditioning, but they do a good job of moving air and they are easy to relocate as necessary. We've purchased these fans over three years and they continue to have one flaw. The thermostatic control bears no reference to reality. The auto on-off functions work fine; but the thermal sensors just aren't anywhere near accurate. The readings are all over the place and typically 10-15 degrees high. It's kind of a shame because everything else works really well and they could have just made them ""3 speed manuals""."
5,It's awesome,"I'm very satisfied with the fan. It keeps my room smelling fresh and well ventilated. It hasn't seen a real test of heat yet, but it does a great job keeping the room comfortable. It does exactly what I bought it for."
5,Excellant product,This fan has worked! It also has a thermometer lit all the time with the temperature of the room. A very good product
4,I liked this fan so much I bought 4!,"This is a really good fan -- it's surprising how powerful it is, since it's so quiet. It's perfect for our bedroom, since you can program it to maintain a certain temperature and it will automatically cycle on and off. Great to have a remote to operate it from the bed. We used to have a giant old Vornado window fan, and this works better and is much more quiet."
5,Great Window Fan. We're Buying More.,I am very pleased with this window fan and for many of the same reasons posted by other buyers. We are using this fan primarily during the summer nights to cool off our home with the cooler air from outdoors. We think that using this fan is more cost-effective than using the air conditioner to cool an entire house that has several empty and un-used rooms. I came back to buy another one.
4,Great fan!,"Love this fan, it's one of the best window fans I've ever bought. In fact, I bought 2 of them. The remote is very handy and I like the thermostat on it."
5,Best Buy on an Exhaust fan I've bought.,I looked all over for an Exhaust fan but I couldn't find one in any of the local stores. So I got one here. Best buy on this kind of item I've ever bought. Serves just what I needed to help take hot air away from the oven when we cook. Since we do not air condition the kitchen we needed something to keep down the heat. This did it! Great product.
4,quiet and easy to install,This fan fit my window and adjusted without difficulty. It is quiet and easy to reverse air flow. It cools the room quickly.
5,Bionaire Fans,These fans work really well. I love the options of both drawing in and expelling air together with the ease of installation. I consider this a product worth purchasing.
5,Twin Window Fan,"I purchased the fan for a second home in the Mts. put it in a loft window to ventalate and conserve the airconditioning. It works great, let me know the temperture in the loft and I could adjust the fan with the remote control from the top of the stairs without going all the way to the window. It kept the loft room at a comfortable temperture. Very quite while running. A good buy."
4,Nice fan with temp. glitch,"The fan does its job. Before we got it we did a lot of research, and it was hands down the best choice for the money. All the functions work pretty nicely EXCEPT the digital thermostat, but not to worry - half of us don't even set it up. For the other half you can do the same thing as I did, like I said we read the reviews on it and every one said that the thermostat is the main draw back but some one actually took it apart and supplied the detailed instructions how to move the thermo wire away from the board, I did it in 20 min., so if you are a handy man then there is nothing to it. Overall we are happy with this fan."
4,Very good fan,"Impressively quiet for the amount of air it moves.Three speeds, the lowest of which is fine for sleeping.Pulls air in, pushes air out, or does both at the same time using one rotor for each.Thermostatic feature works great for when it's cool outside and hot inside. Fans shut off when the temp inside reaches your desired temperature, so you don't end up freezing. Fans turn on when it gets warmer, to maintain your desired temp.I wish the labels on the remote, and on the fan itself, were easier to read. Very low contrast."
4,Great product - solid build!,I have had this specific model for five years and when I bought other Bioniaire window fans was not as satisfied as with this one ...sturdy durable.great buy..works well for summer heat as well in kitchen window to evacuate food smell
1,Have not recv merchandise yet!!!!!,Can't review. Have not recv merchandise. Very long shipment time. Will rate after I recv merchandise. It's been almost 2 weeks.
2,Exchange means in/out runs at same time.,"The exchange air feature means that while one fan draws outside air in, the other draws inside air out. But since the edges of the fans are about 2 inches apart, some portion of the air just drawn in is immediately pulled out. I could not feel much air movement 8 inches from the front on the fan blowing in. Alas, the best automatic operation I can get is to exhaust air when inside temp is above a certain temperature during the day. I have to manually change the fan direction to draw in cooler outside air at night."
3,I guess its worth the money!!,"I guess its ok!!! I mean I could have gotten worse!I had gone off the review where the guy had bought and reviewed all 3 simular competing models. That what I based my purchase from, and I am not disapointed....but I am not thrilled either.First off it is quiet. I have it in my bedroom and hardly hear the thing. I really enjoy the programable thermostat that will shut the fan off when it reaches the set temp, or turns back on when it needs to.What doesnt thrill me is that it doesnt fit my window perfect. One side is the usual acordian fan style adjustment, but the other is fixed. The other thing that doesnt exactly thrill me is that it only works great for that room.....I have other fans going to try and push air thru the rest of house to that fan.Shipping was great...showed a day earlier than expected.I dont think I would buy again, unless I got one for each room. Spend the extra money to get a bigger fan that will push or pull more air."
5,Love this window fan,I now have 3 of these fans through my home and they are wonderful. Nice to have fresh air also nice to have them turn on and off automatically. I love the remote control. Great product
2,Marginal,"Cons: The amount of air it pushes is pathetic, especially for the price. The fan housing developed a huge 14 inch crack on the FIRST day I used it.It wasn't cracked when I unpacked it. The plastic is just very cheap. I'm guessing the quick change in air temperature is what caused the cracking.Seriously... why would an engineer design an object that was designed to change the air temperature, and build it with plastic that's so cheap it can't withstand temperature change?Pros: It's a fan. It blows air. It has electronic functions that work as advertised. It still runs as advertised even with the cracked housing."
5,Bionaire BW2300 Twin window fan with remote control,Very good fan with remote.Quiet running and powerful with 3 speeds.Does a great job in cooling the room.Easy to install and use.Also has a digital thermostat.
2,Great fan - but you can't clean it!,"I bought this fan several years ago. I would give it four stars as it really cools down a workspace if the temperature outside is below 90 degrees. Above 90 - forget it. It's time for the AC. One more thing, if it's a very hot and humid day and the sun is baking down on the unit, it also won't be much help.I don't find the other complaints about the temperature gauge not working all that important. For me, it's the problem with cleaning the unit. You can't open it completely in order to clean the fans. (If you can, please post how to do it here). I called Bionare and I was amazed when the representative told me you can't open the unit!Bionaire is supposed to be THE company as far as allergy helping products are concerned, and yet they manufacture a unit that can't be cleaned! The fans are covered with soot, as are the plastic vents.If someone has discovered a way to completely clean this unit properly, please post it."
3,"Nice fan, but....","I have one and only one real complaint with the fan, I think all the past reviews that hailed it as a quiet and good fan are all correct, but...and maybe mine's busted, but the theromstat sucks!As soon as I plugged it in the thermostat starting showing ridiculously high temperatures, with the fan on or off and it actually would show higher temps once I turned the fan on. Now, its been a little warm in SoCal lately, but at 8am I don't think its 98 degrees in my kitchen...and then turning the fan on drives the thermostat off the charts so it can only read ""Hi"" because it doesn't read above 100 degrees.Since I'm going to use it in a kitchen the auto-temp thing doesn't really matter, but if I had bought this to keep things a regulated temp in say my bedroom, I think I'd be out of luck."
3,not strong enough,"I wanted a window fan with both exhaust and intake, and definitely wanted a remote. This was the only one I found that fit those conditions. My only complaint with it, besides from the thermostat problem that is not accurate, is it just isn't a strong enough fan. I want to be able to sit 8 feet from it and feel a cool breeze coming in when I have it on and it's cool outside, but it's no good at that distance. You have to be very near it to actually feel it. Same when it's on exhaust. I'm a smoker so I wanted a good exhaust fan, and again, this fan is not nearly strong enough."
3,"Ordered 2 - 1 works great, the other makes noise","I ordered 2 for the bedrooms in our home. They arrived 2 weeks apart. The first one that arrived works wonderfully - - I'd give it the highest recommendation. The second one however makes noise. The fan hits one of the wires or something. I tried taking it apart to adjust it but without success. It's not as easy as other fans that I've owned in the past to make adjustments to. Long story short....after trying to fix it, the second fan doesn't make noise when running forward but on the exhaust setting it still wacks into something. Anyway, we are sort of satisfied with this product and would sort of recommend it."
5,Great fan!,"This fan is great. Easy to install and so easily moved from one window to another at any time. The controls are easy to use and the fan is quiet even at the highest speed. The intake setting is very effective - more so than the big box fan I used to have in the window. The exchange setting also is effective at creating circulation, especially in a small room with only one window. It hasn't been as effective as I'd hoped at withdrawing hot air from the room (like in the evening when the air outside has cooled off, but the inside air is still hot), but I might just not have the proper configuration of fan placement and windows open. Overall a great purchase!"
4,Bionaire Twin Fan,"Love this product! I bought this product to keep my room cool and it does just that!It sit in my window vertically with a little help of some tape to keep it from falling off. There's a pull-out board to cover the rest of the window (to keep air from leaking in and out).The 3 airflow setting (In, out, and exchange) is very useful. Set to ""In"" when the air outside is cooler than the air in your room, but if your door is close and there's no where for the air to escape than set to ""Exchange"".This twin fan has 3 settings for power (Low, medium and high).The built in thermometer is somewhat useful (somewhat because the only time it is correct is when the airflow is set to 'In', don't know why, maybe you have to move the thermometer further away from the circuit board inside as recommended in other reviews of this product).The remote is really handy, never ever have to leave your desk/bed to turn on/off, or adjust the temperature, power, or air flow."
3,great until it broke,"I liked this fan a lot until it broke. It worked well for ~4 years. Then one day I noticed only one of the two fans was working, it was on all the time (regardless of temp), and you could only turn it off by unplugging it. I don't know if it's still covered by warranty. I bought a newer version of this fan that I like better, the Bionaire BW2100. I prefer that one because you can manually choose which side of the fan you want to blow in or blow out. This one has an ""exchange"" mode but you don't get to specify which of the fans blows in which direction. I am also curious about the Homes HAWF3095. That one looks exactly the same as the newer Bionaire except without a remote. And it's [...] cheaper."
4,Quiet and Powerful,"This is my fourth window fan. It is the quietest and most powerful yet. My thermostat did not work either. I adjusted the thermostat wire, which helped some, but it's not very accurate still. But I don't care too much, I like the remote control. If it lasts, then it will be definitely worth the 4 stars."
4,This item has a problem with the temperature sensor.,"I will be following the advice and instructions provided by ""Wayne-in-Seattle"" to open up the unit and stretch out/otherwise ""fix"" the temperature sensing wire. The unit was just delivered, and I plugged it into a wall socket where it would be used. I did not turn the unit on. Instead, I let it ""sit"" and let it acclimate itself to its new home. Later in the evening I checked to see what it's temperature reading was. The fan was standing vertically in an open window. The time was about 9:30 p.m. My room temperature gauge read 73 Degrees F. The unit temperature read 89 Degrees F. I suspect the unit has the same problem as described by ""Wayne-in-Seattle"" in the list of reviewers. I will have to play with the wire. All other functions seem to be working ""OK"" so far. The fan is quieter than I expected, and I use it to vent hot air out of an upstairs loft. It's cheaper than running a heat pump in the loft."
4,pretty darn good,"Works well and is quiet. Saves on air conditioning by pulling cool night air into the house, so it pays for itself!"
5,Excellent air mover!,"It cools the air in the afternoon from over 100 to something in the low 90s and by the time the sun goes down, the apartment is very close to a good temp."
5,big fan of the fan,"I've pretty much had this thing running non-stop in a window since I got it. The fans are powerful and draw plenty of air either in, out, or through an exchange. I can't wait for fall when I can pull outside evening air into my unit. So far, it's great!"
2,"Bad Temp Indicator/inpossible to get extender panels 4""","The temp indicator is off and do not work right. I was unable to find the 4"" extender panels only 3.5"". The fan comes with the 4"" panels but no one has them or making them. Over all I was disappointed with the Bionaire, BW2300, window fan.IGC"
4,wonderful,"This fan work wonderful its very quiet, you can always set it at a tempture example 79 degree if the temperture gets below 79 the fan automatically turn off.Its have many different features."
5,Worth the price - makes a big difference!,"I trusted the positive reviews of this product, and they were right. This fan cools any room in my house, dropping the temp. several degrees. I run it on the middle speed, and the noise is fine. (A little too loud on top speed, but then I never need to run it that high to cool the room.) It is light and easy to put in the window, and makes it possible for me to keep the a/c off a lot more often. Wish I had bought one years ago."
2,Ok if you want an outdated calendar,"I bought this (and returned it) because it was a 2005-2006 calendar. Who needs an outdated calendear? Amazon doesnt disclose the year in its write-up, if you look real close on the photo you can see it is not a 2007."
1,Frustrating book,"I guess the positive reviews come from Cold Fusion developers. I'm trying to use Access or SQL, and none of the examples worked for me. I noticed a bug as well. None of my correspondence to the author was answered, and there is no list of errata on his web page. The book was a waste of $50 for a project I needed done yesterday."
5,An excellent adventure with rich characters.,I loved reading this book. I read the whole book in one sitting. The characters are rich and the fantastic world they inhabit are vivdly drawn. The story moves at an unbroken pace that will keep you turning the pages from the first to the last. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves an adventure.
2,Not a Precision ruler,"Works fine if you don't need to be 100% accurate. The one I received was almost a full 1/64 inch short for the first inch. This item did not work for me, sicne I bought it to measure string height on a guitar."
4,Page turner,"If you like mystery, romance and Christian fiction, then this is a good book to pack for your road trip. I read it in a couple of stops because it moves along at a fast clip, leaves you hanging in the right spots, and develops its plot twists well. As a matter of fact, I'm about to go search for another Rushford book.The only minus to the book is the way everything neatly wraps up in the last few pages...but most novels suffer this similar fate. Despite the negative, the book has a lot to offer."
5,What An Singer,If you ever enjoyed an Conway Twitty concert or if you enjoyed great country music then this is one is for you so seat back and enjoyed the great singer at his best right before he died this is the last concert that he did so this is an must for any Conway Twitty fan.It has all the hits and then some so buy one and enjoy Conway as he was and always will be remember has the greatest voice that country music has ever had.Rondall Banks
5,the greatest show on earth,"i had the pleasure of being at fifteen of his concerts from 1983 to 1993 most of which were at a place called tombstone junction. but i also saw him in lexington and louisville and owensboro,ky. this show on this dvd was in late 1992 and was not the last concert he ever gave. it is an awesome show. for those of you lucky enough to have ever been to one of his concerts then you know like me how great he was and if you havent then this is the dvd for you."
1,Conway Twitty Greatest Hits Live,I was very disappointed in the poor quality of this DVD. I love Conway Twitty but couldn't finish watching it.
1,Conway Twitty DVD,I was so disappointed in the quality of this DVD. Conway Twitty is one of my favorite singers and I have enjoyed his music for years. I was so looking forwarding to seeing him perform via DVD. It was impossible to see him clearly because the video was SO blurry. There was so much blackness that just ruined the performance. It made me very sad.
1,blank cd,"ordered cd and received it on time put in player and nothing sent it back and received a second cd with the same results nothing what,s going on?"
2,Conway Twitty live,I was a little disappointed in the production of this DVD because it was poorly done. It does not measure up to the quality of other live performance clips I have heard Conway perform.
1,Inexcusable,"I have always enjoyed Conways music for years and haveseen him live in concert. This video is pure amature.The quality is as if someone was using the first video camera available to public for the first time. Most of thevideo was out of focus and not stabalized. Conway haddefinetly lost his awesome singing voice & his appearance showed he was totally out of shape, sweating profusely and constrained by a jacket that was several sizes too small for his expanded body. A truly painful experience."
4,Underground Doing Great!!,"it's like this,everyone doesnt like puffy.This is for people who enjoy hiphop not hippop.The dopest track on here is Dilalted Peoples ""Work the Angles"",a track that will make ya grandma wanna grab the mic.Other notable groups are Wildcats,Smut Peddlers,Hi and Mighty,and Mike Zoot.This is definetly for the true hiphop fans.Its a peek at the stars of tommorow,I hope taktikal@mailcity.com"
4,Good book for research,I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to research Rome in light of the New Testament and its role during that time period.
2,Not upto the expectations,"I agree that it is doing cleaning without usage of harsh chemicals. but, it is not upto my expectations when dealing with harsh stains on the kitchen & bathroom groves. it is not removing the black stuff as i was expecting to do it. i hope that i am using it properly. i got this one yesterday only and will make more attempts to clean it before returning it."
1,This is the Dumbest Product I've Ever Bought,"Bring on the harsh, toxic chemicals!!!! They work!!! This doesn't!! I bought this product at Bed, Bath and Beyond (with an expired 20% off coupon, which they'll gladly accept) for about $34. Wanted to use it to clean grease from the stove, dishwasher detergent residue from the edge of my dishwasher and soap scum from the shower door. The Shark didn't work for any of these tasks. I then started trying to clean the countertops and sinks, to see if it would clean anything at all. Why not just use a rag soaked in warm water? This is just silly nonsense. What a rip! The steam doesn't get hot enough at all. Returned product for a full refund."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased one, got it home, followed the instructions--thing never worked. Brought it back, got another one--followed the instructions--thing never worked. Decided not to waste my time and go for a 3rd try. If you buy one, just save the receipt, in case it doesn't work, you can return it."
1,May be the worst product I've ever purchased.,This product is cheap plastic and just does not work. I have pumped and pumped the trigger and still no steam will come out. Only little drips of water. I let it heat up for quite awhile. It is very hot to hold. This just does not work. I have a sneaky suspicion that my item may have been previously returned by someone else as the manual was already open to an inside page and the plastic bag with the attachments was already ripped open. I guess someone else sent it back since it didn't work and they just passed it on to the next unsuspecting consumer. I wish I could rate it zero stars.
1,Don't bother buying!!,"My husband and I were given the Ero-Pro Select Steam Bottle Model #SC618HD for Christmas last year. We did not try to use it right away because it was winter, and we wanted to use it to clean our outdoor furniture. In the Summer we took it out, read the owner's manual, did what it stated and it would not work! NO STEAM AT ALL, not even a drip of water!! We tried several times to get it to work with no results. We called Customer Service and they couldn't give us any ideas on how to possibly fix the problem. They did mention that we could have it serviced. This was a brand new item, and it should have worked. Due to the person who gave it to us no longer having the receipt, we ended up throwing it away in the trash! I would NOT recommened this item to anyone!!"
2,Little steam from a little bottle,"Luckily I got this product second hand. It seems to work as well as a spray cleaner. You have to scrub afterwards. I'm thinking that I may try putting some of my eco friendly cleaner in with the water. Hey I got it for 5$. If I ruin it no harm done.I do however think this might be a great help in my laundry room for de-wrinkling my husband's shirts. I think I'm going to try that first and then it'll be a 5$ garment steamer.Yeah, if you want a miracle steamer. DON'T buy this one. If you want a little extra help cleaning and no chemicals, I say go for it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have never been so disappointed in a product that I felt the need to return it (I just deal make it work. nothing is perfect) much less seek out Amazon to rant about it.This one made me do it. It takes several minutes of sputtering and hissing before it even produces steam. Fine. The handle gets very hot but you can feel that the container of water is still lukewarm.The sputtering steam blast lasts for all of 20 seconds before it needs to rest again. It then shuts down to ""reheat"" in which time you are to wipe over the soiled areas yourself to fully clean the area.I accomplished more with the scouring pad and water in that down time than this product managed."
1,No return information with product instructions,"I was not satisfied with this product for the following reasons;- There was no frequent problems and solutions for this product in the intructions booklet.- They do not include return instructions. You have to call the customer service line. One word-FRUSTRATION.- They charge too much for shipping and handling.Although I'm still in the process of trying to return it, I hope I don't have to go through a frustrating process to reurn it."
3,Typical official fiction single apart from title track,"Deja vu is arguably the best song released from official fiction, meaningful lyrics, nice music and beautiful string section.Losing my mind is a fairly straightforward song like many bsides from this era, nothing bad but nothing standoutBlueprint architecture as aboveYou only hide (live acoustic) is a nice clean unplugged version with great production.Stock standard single from latter days SFK, gone is the creativity of the past and the edginess and angst in the music and lyrics but nothing is overtly wrong with it.. ?"
4,Unbeatable for the price,"For $80, what is not to love about this lens? Yes, it has distortion and the contrast could be better, and the edge sharpness could be better, and on and on... but to get all that you have to spend $1600, and this is $80. It is a no brainer. It's built pretty good - plastic but solid. The focus and zoom are a bit clankie but again... $80. How does one complain?I am a pro - I shoot mainly actors headshots so I am not doing a lot of critical stuff on the 19-35mm, but what I have been shooting with it has come out fine, and a few minutes in photoshop and it is dandy. I even shot it out against a canon 17-35 L or whatever the number is, and honestly, the optical difference is nowhere near the price difference. Half the time I couldn't tell which was which - and I am shooting on an 5D Mk 2 which is pretty good about showing up problems. So, if you aren't doing critical work, or you are looking to get into wider angles, this is a good way to start."
3,Good lens for the amateur photographer,"This is not a superb lens, nor its pictures will be on the front pages of a magazine. Many people misunderstand the purpose of budget lenses, they want the sleeper lens for forty bucks, no, it will not happen.Lke most cheap lenses, they perform better in daylight at f8 to f11 or when used with flash. It may sound weird, but the flash pictures tend to come out better than even with brand lenses. Another thing I have noticed, at least on my D60, setting d-lightning and noise reduction off gives much better results. Its a tricky spontaneous lens, so expect to play a little with under-over exposure as sometimes the meter is not consistent with these kind of third party cheap lenses.Yes, I would recommend it, just do not expect magical jaw dropping results."
3,Amazon.com,"Very Satisfied with all items I have purchased from Amazon - it is one of the first places I look when I need something.Thanks for all the hard work!Rick HarganQuinton, Virginia"
4,Cheap price but does the trick,"Very decent lense for the Canon Eos, does the trick, shipped promptly.Vignetting is very low, while there is some, it is much better outside than inside. Construction is good, autofocus is good,very lightweight does not look cheap, hood makes it look much larger.Excellent value for the $ spent."
2,Works great for the money,The lense I purchased have served me well. I take a lot of pictures with it with my Rebel xt. I like to get close to my subjects as well as getting the background in. The zoom allows composition. I am pleased with the results when they are printed in 8 1/4 x 11 1/4 on a page in color. Would recomend it to anyone who wants an inexpensive lense for the purpose stated above.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I think it's a waste of money to buy this lens, I took some pictures when I received it and all were useless."
3,Cosina 19-35mm f/3.5-4.5 MC AF Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon EOS / EF,This lens is very affordable and at the same time produce comparable photographs with the original Canon 18-55mm take at the same distance.
4,Excellent book - Only a few flaws,"I think this book is one of the best Tobias books, but it seems so abrupt when he meets his mother. It's almost like Tobias says, ""Hi, I'm your son."" Then it's as if his mother says, ""Oh. Okay then. I knew that."" I don't really like that part. Otherwise, it's pretty good. There are good Rachel and Tobias parts, an appropriate amount of action, and a great deal of emotion."
2,NOT CARBON FIBER!!!!!!,These are NOT carbon fiber and don't even look much like it either... I may send them back. They look fair but not as they were said to be OR what I excepted.
4,A nice collection of Libertad Lamarque songs,"This set of CDs with 40 songs should be of interest to Libertad Lamarque fans.CD 1 contains mostly tangos such as: Besos Brujos, Caminito, La Cumparsita, A Media Luz, Uno and Madreselva which are my favorites but there are other good renditions.Although the sung tango is largely the domain of male artists such as Carlos Gardel and Hugo del Carril, Libertad Lamarque more than holds her own in this musical form.CD 2 has Jurame, Cuando Vuelva a Tu Lado, Cielito Lindo, and Maria La O. plus other Latin American favorites."
2,Surface skimmed here.,"The authors express a lot of their opinions and personal points of view within this workbook, versus really convincing the reader about the true nature of sins. In reading through the different chapters, it is hard to find a complete separation in their writing between one deadly sin described and another - perhaps there isn't any, but perhaps that is where the discussion could lead. As a result it seems that the surface is skimmed repeatedly, but the real meat of the matter remains where it was before the workbook! As a workbook for discussion groups studying seven deadly sins, this workbook would probably create the same exact discussion for every session. Another result of the authors' bias would probably create a trail of condemnation versus a pathway for enlightenment concerning these sins. In conclusion, this work falls short of what it could have been."
3,I now know what the 7 capital sins are,Short workbook which covers the 7 capital sins. I gave 3 stars because the workbook seemed a bit short. I thought it should gone more in depth about the sins.
3,"Worthwhile book, with a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking","This was a worthwhile book for those trying to understand the politics, economics, and organization going on behind the war effort. However, O'Neill often makes the cardinal sin of historians and forgets the context of the moment when passing judgement on decisions and strategy by both Rooesevelt and his military leaders. His assessment of Iwo Jima as being unworthy of the effort expended to capture it overlooks the fact that, at the time, the U.S. didn't know the war was going to end so soon. Should be read in conjunction with David Brinkley's ""Washington Goes to War."""
5,A genuinely brilliant treatise on America in World War II,"""A Democracy at War"" is absolutely remarkable. Exceptional breadth and depth - from the military to the geopolitical, from tactics and warfighting to grand strategy, from the human to the technological, from the soldier to the civilian and the statesman, from American democracy to foreign dictatorships. Spellbinding and absorbing. No wonder Stephen E. Ambrose calls it ""the best single volume on the American experience in World War II that I have read."" That is also my reaction."
2,can you say- textbook?,"After reading this book for my WW2 history class, also taught by Oneill, I am left wondering how such a brilliant lecturer can write such a bad book. The book is a poor read and reminded me of the common fact based stuff i read in high school. Information is plentiful, but to cover the entire war in such a disorganized way doesn't do it justice. In his class we also read ""Touched with Fire"" and ""Nazi Germany and World War 2"", which covered the Pacific war and Germany. Time better spent would be reading these two. They are both chronological and much better books in general."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"This is amazing! My hair is very thick and wavy--I have tried many other straighteners and none compare to this one! This dries and straightens my hair very fast! Also, it leaves my hair shiny and soft! I LOVE IT!!"
5,da realest female right now,"boo comes correct with her lifestyle even though i may not agree with what she do, but i love her honesty. she holds it down thug style in memphis.the whole cd is blazing, 3 6 mafia clik is about the few southern rappers who have not crossed over, boo keep it real."
5,Queen of Memphis still representing,Gangsta Boo the Queen of Memphis is still proving that she runs the south with her blazing lyrics. Everysong on this CD is worth listing to.My favorite song is #14 I faked it last night and #15 chop shop w/ project pat. If you don't have thisCD you need to go get it trust me it's worth buying
4,"Not Her Best Album, But I Loved It Anyway","This was Gangsta Boo's second album, and the last with Three 6 Mafia. Lyrically it was not very strong but it is her funnest album. She dosen't take on any really serious issues with this one so there is a lot of that crazy crunkness and some really good beats throughout it. Some of the stuff she say's when she's dissin or making fun of someone or something is really funny and just makes you laugh. She can really be in your face with it. My three favorite tracks are ""Can I Get Paid"", ""Love Don't Live"", and ""What You N****s Want"". It's a Southern classic."
3,Not the best album,This album is not the best by her This was the First album I bought by this Rapper. I liked Three songsout of sixteen. I was mad because alot of people wanted me to hear it first.
4,Tight CD!!,"Once agian Hypnotize Minds has came out with another solid album. Hypnotize Minds has a reputation of making beats that will rattle your trunk, and Gangsta Boo's album proves that point. Even though this might not be AS good as Boo's last album ""Enquiring Minds"", the cd will get serious play inside the car systems. Really I don't have any favorite tracks because I like them all, but some tracks that stand out are ""Mask 2 My Face"", ""They Don't Love Me"", and ""I Faked It Last Night"". One tight track is ""Same Block"", which has a tight scratching sound in the background. My only beef with this album is that she dosen't sound as fierce as she was as on her first album , but this is only a minor flaw. The album is highly recommended to your Three 6 Collection. Buy It! Out!"
1,S*!T,"This is a waste of money EVERY song has the same old school rap style by G.Boo.Mostly All of the beats are the same too in the biggining of each song the beats are good but once she starts singing the beats change.So all of this means this cd has:Bad beats,old beats.Bad rap styles& the worst of all the singer."
2,An okay book,"this book is well detailed in telling you about units,civilizations and technologies. It's not too good for scenerio or multiplayer tips. Everything mentiond you can get from Age's help index"
4,"Good, but not comprehensive","This is not a comprehensive book on heart disease prevention as claimed by Dr. Oz on the cover of the book, because this book's focus is on drugs and supplements. However, this book makes a great companion to a comprehensive book such as ""Heart 411"" or ""Take A Load Off Your Heart"" both of which are great books. So I think this book is good for what it covers and for that I will give it 4 stars."
5,Felling Better.,After three months of following Dr. Sinatra's nutritional suggestions I feeel 100% better. Now I am hoping to feel 100% better than this. I gave this book to my cardiologist
4,well structured. Integrated aproach,recommend to family. well structured. interesting. good basis for further study. integrated approach. science mechanisms explained clearly for the lay reader
4,A lot of information in an easy to read format,"I was recently diagnosed at the age of 41 with congestive heart failure. It came on fast, and I was not prepared for it. I have been researching on the internet the procedures, drugs, and supplements that might be effective in treating my condition, but the information is all over the place and difficult to bring together. In ""Reverse Heart Disease Now"", there is a lot of information on suppplements as well as conventional therapy, with excellent suggestions on dosages and what benefits might be expected. I read the book all of the way through and gained a better understanding of my own condition. In these days of fast and prepared food, stress, polution, etc. having this knowledge is a must even if there are no symptoms. I wish that I had come across this book 5 years earlier!"
3,Still confused,"a year after reading this, and taking most of the he supplements recommended, I don't know if I'm better off or not. I don't really feel any different. I did start to take a statin after a heart scan showed a small area of soft plaque. That seems to have altered the lipid profile the most.I just wish that the MDs that write these books didn't also go out and peddle their advice (with Sinatra, supplements) as I believe this has to alter their objectivity. I'll keep reading and trying to do my own integration of all the advice out there."
3,"interesting economics, but what's the greater relevance?","First off, this is not a book to read if you want to know how Marx critiques capatalism. Sure that's touched on a little, but most of the book is devoted to pure economics, without any talk at all about how the economics comment on the way society, and capatalist firms function. The book is locked into numbers, and I'm guessing that it was meant to be used in a college course as a supplement. He says that his math is on the level of intermediate economics, and he's probably right, but don't expect him to do any explanation, he just plows on through, leaving those who aren't so lucky as to have taken up to intermediate economics courses left in the dust. No empirical analysis whatsoever, except for a calculation of the social surplus and the labor value of money. If your an economist you'll have a ball."
5,Excellent Shaver,"Over the past several decades I have purchased shavers from a variety of manufacturers, including Norelco, Remington, Panasonic, Grundig and others. The Remington R-9300 is the best I have ever used. It provides a very close, comfortable and reasonably fast shave without the noise and vibration one would have with a foil shaver. It has several attractive features, such as a nice travel pouch instead of a small cloth sack and a useful LCD display of shaving minutes remaining. Please be aware that it takes a couple of weeks of use before one's skin adapts to the shaver. The manufacturer states that the shaver can be cleaned using tap water. I have not attempted to clean the shaver with water due to my unfortunate experience with a Norelco Quadra action. Instead I simply use the cleaning brush provided, complemented by an air cleaner which is particularly helpful when cleaning the combs. I hope this review is helpful."
1,Hard to adjust,This Caliper is much to delicate for use on a lathe for turning. I also found the adjustments both in and out hard to turn.
2,too vague to be useful for training,"This book provides some useful tips on choosing a Sheltie, but I think most people who buy a book like this have already bought one and want to train it!The training part of the book is the weakest area. It teaches how to do some basic obedience training (sit, down, etc.) but not much else. Basically, for advanced training it recommends that you find a good training school. Great, but I didn't need a book to tell me that.There are much better books that provide a more detailed explanation of the Sheltie, and give better tips on training. My recommendation is ""Shetland Sheepdog: A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog""."
1,Train your Shetland Sheepdog,"I was disappointed in this book. It was a ""read between the lines"" kind of book. Was not helpful in training my dog at all."
1,Bad bussiness.,"This is the 3rd time I'm sending a note, reporting that the book Flemish and Dutch drawings from the 15th to the 18th century(Drawingsof the masters), was in very bad shape, the hard cover is missing and the paper cover is all scratch and tore, I'm very disappointed of this order, the seller information was that the book with the hard cover was in good shape."
1,Don't Buy This Recording,The sound quality of this recording is unacceptable. It should not have been offered for public sale.
4,A look back in anger and wonder,Marvelous rediscovered footage taken by Swedish film crews in the United States. A combination of revealing looks at our history from an outsiders' point of view mixed with modern commentary and reflections on the time. A wonderful way to look back and get a feel for the times.
5,I want More,"The show was sooooo good. I loved the characters, even if we only met them a few times. I want to find out how it went the entire mystery that surrounds the missing mom. The hunt for whatever it was, all of it just give us some answers"
4,Real life Jonny Quest,"Veritas the Quest is a live action Jonny Quest. The young boy (although teenage here), the scientist father, no mother, the mysterious bodyguard, flying all over the world, it's all there."
1,Still can't figure it out,"This book was a big disappointment. First of all it was written years ago, before Mr Patterson was a good writer. It is an example of greed, trying to pass off an early work as new.Second, for the life of me I can't figure the supposed ""plot"" in the novel. Who is actually working for who. Who are the real bad guys? And then there is the discovery of who the terrorist is. It is so unbelievable, it will make you laugh.All in all, a great disappointment from a fine writer"
2,Black Friday,"I really enjoyed the Alex Cross series, so I thought I would enjoy this book as well. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The story line really dragged on, with very little action. The main character was fairly dull and boring. The story finally picked up towards the end, but by then, I was so worn down by the story, I bearly had the energy or desire to continue. Finally, when the story could have gone on another 50 pages and been worth the reading time, he abruptly ended the story with a cheesy ending. What a waste of my time."
2,NOT HIS BEST,"Fans of the Alex Cross novels are in for a BIG disappointment. James Patterson has strayed from his from his ""killer"" thrillers and has ventured into the Adventure/Espionage territory. I could not finish this book, I found the plot to be weak and the pacing of the book slow."
1,Absolute drivel,"The worst book I have paid for and read in a long time.The storyline is weak, the plot unbelievable and the characters could be drawn better by a high school student.It gets a big THUMBS DOWN from me."
2,suspence,I find that the novels which has Alex Cross in them are more enjoyable. This novel is a little slow for me.
2,"Mr. Patterson I love you, but I hate this book","Two stars is generous. This is one of J.P.'s worst books. There are only 4-5 of his books that I don't like; (in order of my least favorite) Thomas Berryman Number, The Lake House (although I did like When the Wind Blows), Black Friday, and Season of the Machete.The story did have promise, but I didn't like the final direction that he choose to go with it. And I had figured out who the ""bad guy"" was about 1/2 way through. I had to force myself to finish this book, which is not something I'm used to with James Patterson."
1,Worst book I've read by Patterson!,"I can't believe I would ever be saying that Patterson wrote a bad book, but I have to. I've read A LOT of Patterson books and this is the first one that took me more than a week to finish. It too me almost a month. It was terrible. I couldn't get into it and it was just weird. Too slow! I still recommend Patterson, because I've loved all the other books I've read, but will not recommend this one! Awful!"
2,Disappointing,"While this isn't the best Patterson book I've ever read it was overshadowed by the horrible editing of the kindle edition. This is by far the worst edited book I've read since I got my kindle a year ago and I've read a lot. At times it was difficult to read because words were wrong and punctuation was terrible. If I was Mr. Patterson I would be ashamed to have my name attached to such a poor quality book. I downloaded this book from my local library, I'm glad I didn't pay for it or I would have been very unhappy."
3,Black Friday,"Black Friday contained a lot of infomation about wall street and world economics so if you are not knowledgeable in this area, fast forward to the plot."
2,Intriguing idea that fails to deliver,"A spy game within a spy game within a spy game. That's what this book tries to be. Unfortunately, it fails on some very basic levels. The book is very disjointed: the different plot lines are sometimes very difficult to swallow (I was often incredulous) and they are not woven together very well at all. The author simply tried to include one too many story lines in this book. The book also suffers from a serious lack of editing. One minute the hero and his girl are talking about the rage they feel, the betrayal of ""the Twelve"", and the very next sentence is about how tender it was when they made love. (Yes, I find my best pillowtalk is always about terrorism.) Not one of Patterson's best efforts on many levels."
1,Check your work,"I am a huge fan of Patterson. This was yet another great story. However, there are so many typos in the Kindle version, at times one needs to use the imagination to suppose what is meant to be said. After reading more than 60 of Patterson's novels, I am switching authors. Not interested in buying more junk."
1,E book conversion badly done,"I read black friday on my Kindle Fire and was so frustrated by the lack of punctuation, poor wording, spelling errors and leaving out words needed to finish a sentence. Some words contained spaces between the letters and some phrases were badly misspelled. I can't imagine this was a direct reproduction of the book. It seems to have been translated into E book by writers not fluent in English. Don't download, you will be greatly disappointed."
4,Solid Patterson book,"I'm probably overrating this book a bit, since I read it after the dreadful London Bridges, and was pleasantly surprised at how good this book was. My expectations were low since this book was written in the mid 80s, and I was expecting it to be very dated. Also, I wasn't sure what to expect from a pre-Along Came a Spider Patterson book.The story revolves around a mass terrorist plot concocted by bitter Vietnam War veterans who want vengeance against the U.S. government and society in general. The way to hit them where it really hurts is by attempting to strike a severe blow towards the U.S. Stock Market, and thus, causing a crash that would severely hurt the U.S. economy. An interesting Pre 9/11 terrorist plot that I very much enjoyed reading."
1,Why I feel ripped off by this book,"OK, let's list the reasons that I feel ripped off by both the author and Amazon.com with this book.1. I bought this book from Amazon.com because I didn't recognize the title and, I assumed, (stupid me) from the copyright date (April 2000) that this was a new title. This book was originally published as Black Market in 1986 and later in 1994. Of course I couldn't tell that from the Amazon.com reviews.2. The book just wasn't that good. It was in no way up to Patterson's usual standard. So, why does the author change the name and copyright date? Hard to tell but it seems to me it is to get us a ploy to buy a poorly written book.The fact that I already own this book makes buying this book under the new title doubly irritating. I won't buy another Patterson novel."
1,Patterson's Black Friday--a weak retread,"I would not recommend this book. It represents the publishers' greediness--that is, an attempt to cash in on the authors' recent sucess. This book was clearly an early publication reject and the author has still not solved the problems for the earlier rejection--i.e., a nothing ending, poor plot development and a weak cast of characters. It's too bad the author allowed this to happen. This is not the first time for Patterson--another of his recent releases is also a retread. He's in it for the bucks, readers...be shy of his retreads..."
2,Dragging,I don't want to trash the book completely cos I am not sure whether you have to work on wall street to enjoy the book or be into the stock market.I read books by Grisham and I am not a lawyer or a criminal justice person and I still enjoy it. The book was kind of slow and boring to me. I had to force myself to finish it cos I needed to satisfy my suspicion about the mystery person and I was right. Apart from that it was somewhat graphic and boring.
3,Chaos and Conspiracy: a tired plot,"This plot is a formula recipe of a central character disoriented by the recent death of his wife, scars from Vietnam and a family of three children cared for by his sister. He confronts an event which is apparently designed to destroy western financial stability. The scope is too big; the villains too numerous; the soul saving ""new"" relationship too convenient. The twist the readers will find at the end of the novel may be intriguing, but this was a disappointing read."
2,Ugg,"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but I'm sorry to say, this book really isn't one of his best. It's awfully boring and the characters really aren't very interesting. I've had a hard time even finishing it. Usually, I can't stand to put one of his books down!For action adventure, I'd suggest reading any of his books with (one of his best characters) Alex Cross in them, or When The Wind Blows and continuation of this story with The Lake House. Suzanne's Diary for Nicolas for a really great, touching story too. Everyone who I've lent it too loves it."
3,"Beware, don't be tricked!","I read this book a few years ago and thought it was okay. BUT THEN IT WAS CALLED BLACK MARKET. Black Friday is not a new book, but a reprint of another book. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a sequel, since many of Patterson's titles sound similar."
2,Black friday,Numerous spelling and grammar errors. Good story but it's really distracting with run on sentences misspelled words etc. At least run spell check . That would have prevented some of the misspelled words and grammar errors.
2,Too many typos,"It was a pretty good book, however, it was very slow reading because there were so many typographical errors. If you need a proofreader, I'm available for hire."
1,No,This is the only book so far of James Patterson that I didn't like. I have read almost all his books. I stopped reading after several chapters. Service was good though.
2,Not Good,"I made myself finish this book, but not because I was enjoying it. I just kept thinking it would get better....sadly, it didnt. This was not the James Petterson that I know and love. The kindle version was also frustrating to read because it was so filled with mistakes."
5,Patterson Fan,It is difficult to find books that have been out for a few years and in good condition then at a price you can afford.
4,A good time filler.,"I read this book and thought it was new like most people who bought it did, and to tell you the truth, I didn't care that it was old because it had a great plot. Now, I'm not sure that I got the plot completely, but I got enough of it to understand it for the most part. Patterson is a great writer in a sea of great writers and that's all I've got to say."
1,Pure junk,This was the first (and last) book I read by this author. I could hardly finish this book. It is boring and primitive.
1,black friday,liked most of his works but this is worst so far... took to long to get plot....seemed like he was searching for it... Boring.
2,missing pages??,This book would be great except it leaves out some descriptions for Mercury and Venus. If one is going to write an astrology book there shouldn't be anything left out. And then the author doesn't give any explanation as to why these are left out. I find that puzzling and a bit unprofessional for book purposes.
2,deception,This book is cool and is interesting to an extent. It gives somewhat accurate description of the planets rulership and how each planet relates with other planets.The problem was that I wanted a book that talked about the weekdays and about the planets that ruled the weekdays. I had the impression that I was getting a book on that.
1,Airy Fairy at Best,Much too simplistic and general. I felt like I was being conned. I'll take Liz Greene any day.
1,Didn't work for me,"This book didn't tell me anything I haven't already read in every other astrology book. From the beginning it explains how the ruling planets are not the same as zodiac signs. I saw no difference, only the titles have been altered. The author definitely put effort into this book, but the reason I didn't like it is because I don't agree with his definition of what my sign should be. As a Leo, supposedly all I do is go to parties and be the one in charge. And I'm hugely popular. Not."
4,Great Source of Information of Countries and Ports of Entry,"This is a well structured book that provides a one stop source of information on port of entry procedures among other thing. However with that said. I have just returned from the Leeward Islands and found the entry procedures have completely changed. No longer do you fly the Q flag and wait, but the skipper can proceed directly to customs and immigrations. This is no doubt due to the increased yacht traffic. So talk with other yachts going to or coming from your destination to get the latest information on entry and clearance information."
3,"Good price, but show some imperfection","After 1 year of almost daily usage, I am pretty satisfied with the 10 inch frypan. Only one slight imperfection however, half year into it, the bottom of the pan starts to bulge outward. When I set it on a table top, it wobbles slightly. This creates uneven cooking on certain types of stove tops, such as the glass flattop that is getting ever more popular. However, I mainly work with electric ranges, and thus the effect of the bulged bottom is more of less diminished. All in all, for what I paid for it, I think it does its job well. I just can't give it a five star rating because it's not perfect."
5,Excellent skillet,"I must confess that I'm new to using stainless steel cookware, but having heard so much about their virtues, this skillet is really a great value for money. I made dishes on this that came out way better than when made on the non-stick cookware that I have. And I don't have to worry about any toxic non-stick coating flaking off into my food.Cleanup is easy too. Empty the pan of food, and pour in a couple of cups of very hot water and scrub the pan with a wooden utensil. Also, though you can wash this in the dishwasher, it's better to hand wash it as the ingredients in dishwasher soap can ruin the finish of the pan."
2,Warped within 2 weeks,"This is my first experience with a stainless steel pan, and overall I love working with this pan. However, the bottom was become warped after only 2 weeks of use. I have never put cold water into it when it was hot and followed all the included care instructions."
3,Deffinetly better chan all clad.,"Its heavier than the same all clad pan, and the handle is uncompfortable for extended use. Food deffinetly sticks less and heats more evenly than all clad. I didnt have any problems with side sticking."
5,Excellent skillets!,"Have been very happy with these skillets. I was worried cleaning stainless steel skillets would be tricky, but my in-laws showed me a trick. Just boil water in the skillet and everything wipes right out. Easy to cook with."
2,Not so good,"Didn't care for this pan, everything stuck. Matter of fact, I think it probably went to the good will. Would not recommend."
5,Great Skillet,"After years of using ""non-stick"" type fry pans we decided to give the Multiclad Stainless a try. I spoke with friends regarding use of this type vs non-stick and the only thing we had to remember is to get the pan hot before adding any oil. This little hint works great and makes clean-up easy. We use this on an electric flat-top stove. The helper ""loop"" opposite the handle is very handy for getting a full and hot pan off the stove safely. We also noted that the pan heats very evenly even though is somewhat larger than the largest burner."
1,unhappy,This pan is not flat on the bottom and thus will spin on the stove and therefore can be dangerous if the handle is hit by accident. This is very true if one has a ceramic glass cooktop stove. It also is therefore a problem when putting in cooking oil in that the oil will pool to one side. It is not a good product!
3,Inflated 'retail' price,"Guess what, this pan is $69.95 on the Cuisinart website! Where the heck did they come up with $135??? What does this mean about other retail prices listed on Amazon? Do your homework before buying!"
2,Pan lacks a lid,"The 12.5 inch Cuisinart Stainless Steel Skillet is a good product. However, both Amazon and Cuisinart rate a big fat zero when for help in finding a lid to fit it.You would think, either or both of them, should be able to help on this problem.Amazon should find out what lid will work, It would help their sales.Cuisinart gave me, eventually, a ridiculous price of some $60, as much as the pan."
1,"10"" isn't made from stainless steel.","I was astonished to find out that 10"" skillet doesn't work on induction stove. This means that it isn't made from stainless steel, since SS is magnetic material and 100% compatible with induction. The most ironic thing, is that i also have 12"" skillet and it DOES work on induction. How is that even possible that two items from a same series are made to different specs from different materials ?"
1,disappointed,You can't brown anything in this skillet. Everything sticks. The helper handle makes it too long to fit in the sink so you can scrub the stuck stuff.
3,Certain items can be defective,"I've bought several of these staplers in recent years and they've worked nicely until now. The main problem with these is its ability to get stuck on staples; meaning the staples are stucked and can't come out because it's somehow twisted in there. [I did use the compatible staples] My solution to this is to get a scissor and get them out one by one. The old one starts to have these types of problems after a year or two of use. However, the new ones that I had just purchase from amazon not only have this problem, but have another major issue as well. And that problem is the staplers' inability to move back into its original position. When I staple something, the stapler wouldn't go back open and just stays shut around the item. I work in a restaurant, I don't have the time to manually pull them apart. I'll buy another brand next time."
5,great product,"I've had these before & after a helper jammed the wrong size staplers into it, I needed to purchase another. It is a great product."
1,Junk,"In a word: junk. This stapler does not use standard staples, which is not clear when purchasing. I had to buy special staples from Amazon and pay to have them shipped. The stapler worked for about an hour before it started to jam. Jams on every other staple. It went in the garbage the first day, and I am out $30."
2,Did not measure up,"I had long owned one of these and continually had problems with the stapler jamming. I'd fight with a pair of needle nose pliers to clear the jam, after which the unit would work for some (usually short) amount of time. Finally reaching my wits end, I decided to try again. Thinking after all these years, surely this issue had been resolved. Surely it had not. Bottom line is 6 months later, the new unit too is in the trash. I won't be back for a third."
2,To many errors,"It's great that there is such a book. However, I checked a few names and already found a few errors: some diminutives are incorrect or not listed at all e.g. Krzysztof diminutive: Kryzys! (should be Krzys). Some feast days are incorrect e.g. Joanna fest day is May 24, not May 30. Some common Polish names are not listed at all: e.g. Ireneusz."
2,Not quite what I what expecting....,"I bought several baby's names book at tha same time, and to tell the truth I was expecting much more of this book, I know that the author try her best, but there is very few names on each letter that I think it is not going to help much to find the perfect name I was looking for...Although there is lack of variety on names, the ones that they appear come in a very organized manner, by gender and alphabetical order, and sometimes include a pronunciation description... Since this is not really what I was expecting I'll try to return it."
4,Pretty good book,"Aside from a few mistakes in the research for this book, it is a pretty solid look at this interesting family. I wish there had been a more substantial bibliography and a film listing, such as is found in the British Royalty book in this series. If you are interested in the Kennedys, buy this book."
4,Informative,"I bought this book for my interest in the Kennedy family. I really didn't understand why they were so popular and what made the Kennedy name so famous. I learned about JFK in history and knew the faces but not the real stories behind this famous family. I bought this out of curiousity and I can frankly say that it has enlightened me. I now know ""who is who"" and ""who married who"" and why JFK was the one ""picked"" to run for president. I wish the book would have delve into Jackie's life a bit more, but overall you get a very good picture of the men and women of the Kennedy name. And I guess I knew JFK was a player, but, oh my! I didn't realize the list was so long. I would recommend it if you are on the same level as I am about this subject. I had heard the rumors, the stories...this book just puts it all in order to make sense of it."
3,"Ambitious goal, poor execution","The author's attempt to explain difference in industries by financial ratios was failed.Indeed, he did bring insight in explaining characteristics of different industries and their independences. However, I could not find much insight in the author's methodology. I would suggest the author to spend more time polishing his academic work into a business-oriented book."
5,Holmes HAPF,These filters work great! We are both smokers and found that we need to change the filters about every other month.
5,Holmes Filters,Functions as advertised. Are much more lightweight than the originals. Don't know if that's good or bad. Easy instillation instructions.
5,"Standard Price, No Time to Acquire","This item cost the same at places like Target, but it only took me 1 minute to order this item. It arrived at my door 36 hours later. Going to Target would take 30 minutes from door to door. A net gain of 29 minutes makes this a no-brainer purchase."
3,Fits Well - Close Facsimile to Filter that Ships with Unit,"Overall I'm happy with these filters - but if you compare the filter material with that of the filter that shipped with the unit initially, it is not exactly the same quality - which surprised me because I thought it would be exactly the same. Nonetheless, this is a good, low price way to buy the filters."
1,Not Holmes Filters,"This product says holmes filters, however they are not.They are generic copies. I would not mind this however selected this option because it Said Holmes, not generic. the problem though that they dont fit exactly(close but no guide to snap into the existing bracket included), and, unlike the actual holmes filters, instead of being white, the filters are black, so there is no way to tell if they are used or new."
5,As advertised,"At first I thought I bought the wrong ones, but they did fit perfectly. Much higher quality than the cheaper cardboard filters."
2,I Didn't Expect This.,"As a smoker, I thought I woud try and clean the air in my livng room so I bought 2 of these because I liked the easy removal of the filters. Was I in for a shock when I went to buy the replacement filters. Who would beleive a years worth of filters costs as much as the air cleaner. I would like to see the price of these come down about 50%. It would almost be worth buying a new air cleaner so you don't have to clean the inside of the machine."
2,Be carefull you get what you order!,This is advertised as a HEPA filter however what is sent it a replacement HEPA-Type Filter! The true HEPA filters for the Holmes tower unit which is shown in the picture has a white filter section not gray and filters down to .03 microns of particulate filtering 99.7% of dirt and dust. HEPA type only filter out 99%. Not a big deal you say? Well if you are an allergy prone person or have an asthmatic in your family this can be the difference between living with pets or no pets at all! I hope AMAZON fixes this advertising flaw ASAP and actually starts selling the real HEPA filters!
4,Nice Filters. A Bit Overpriced.,"Nothing much to say except that these are nice filters. They are the only ones that will fit the holmes air filter systems and they are a bit pricey, but there's really no other choice."
3,Works well but doesn't last long,"This is a 2 pack of Holmes filters. They work well but do not last as long as they should. I have to change my filters every 2 - 2 1/2 weeks. If I would have known this information, I would have purchased a different air cleaner.The transaction with Amazon itself was smooth, quick and I received my item quickly."
4,altogether good,"neck was little tight, otherwise every thing else about this product pretty good...nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice"
2,Not quality checked,"I guess you get what you pay for. In this case it is thin stretchy material poorly overlocked. I will need to re-do the neckline, and hem it. It was left without any hem at all. Threads having off.One hole was missing from front lacing. Clearly no quality checking going on.Plus I will re-inforce the seperate neckpiece as it is very flimsy and was bent in packaging.I may write another review after it has been worn this halloween"
4,lovely costume,my daughter looked very pretty with this costume... she really liked it.. it was kind of long for her but I cut it and didnt have to do anything else... the only problem was the collar..it kept moving and bending...it does not stay up for a long time...
3,okay,Delivery was ontime! That was a big plus. The price was just right and that was another plus. I just didn't like the quality of the product as much; but it was ok!
3,Halloween,cheap fabric! ripped the same night she wore it ! and the collar wouldn't stay up was not happy with this order
5,gift for halloween ostime,my granddaughter loved it. And she is a 5 yr old Diva. The long drapes on the sleves were great as well as the neck.
4,Cute,"This was a cute costume, but the neck piece didn't actually stay like the picture shows. Other than the neck piece my daughter loved this costume."
4,"Great, inexpensive costume","My 7 year old wanted to be a vampire for Halloween and this costume fit the bill. Plus, it was not nearly as expensive as most costumes.It's very durable, and put together surpisingly well (compared to those cheaply made costumes).After adding makeup and crazy hair - she was a very beautiful and scary vampiress!"
5,great value for the price !,my daughter loved it ! It was very easy for her to put on herself for the school Halloween parade.
4,Daughter loves it...,"When my 7 year old daughter chose to be a vampire for Halloween we got online together to search for a costume and this is the one that she chose. It's not the best quality and is thin, she wore leggings and a long sleeve black tee underneath when going trick or treating. Also, the collar does not stand up on its own at all, but we took two safety pins and pinned it to the back of her hair and it looked perfect, lol. We did her hair just like the girl in the photo. Those are the things that mommy would notice, but as for my daughter she absolutely loved it and still enjoys wearing it around the house every now and then :)"
4,"fun, cute, typical",My daughter wore this for halloween and had a lot of fun with the costume. The neck piece was just a foam piece that really didn't stand up very well. It kept laying down around her shoulders. We bought a cheep pair of fake fangs from Wal-mart and she was very happy with it. The quality is typical of something from Wal-mart but for the price I wouldn't expect more. It is January now and it has moved into the dress up box and my girls still play with the dress part. The collar is now in the trash. It was worth the $ because they play with it. Funny thing is since they don't have the collar it is more of a princess dress.
4,"Makes a great evil queen costume, like in sleeping beauty","Comfy item, the front tie could be longer. Overall we are very pleased. Too big and very long (dragging) on my 4 1/2 y.o. Might fit a kid as old as 7 if she were small."
1,Don't waste your money,"This costume is terrible. It isn't made well. The collar doesn't stay up right and it doesn't fit right. My daughter is 9 average/thin and the medium was too short in the arms and length and the large was way too big. Also, the way it hangs when it is on, is very odd. We took it back."
3,recommended for anthology readers and superheroes fans,Demon Huntress: SACRIFICEDan okay story but felt like it didn't belong with the other stories.WITH GREAT POWERa dystopian story and my favorite out of all of these.HEROES INCORPORATEDhumorous. Liked it.SILKwould have liked a little more info about Silk's father's experiments.
3,Super Reader,"Erotica, pron, call it what you like, this is pretty much very well towards that end of the genre. A bit on the softer side, though, so more erotica than pron, if you want to be technical, most definitely. It is also an at times amusing superhero satire, and at others straight superhero tales.An example of the former is the tryout for new heroes joining a superhero group has a decidedly important sexual component.An example of the latter is when a female superhero must come to terms with an incubus type demon, and realise they can work together to stop a common problem. Not to mention do a bit of shagging."
4,blonde baby doll,"Okay, I admit to being disappointed because this pretty little doll's eyes don't open and close. It's entirely my fault for not reading closely. I chose this doll for my two year old granddaughter because of the resemblance and because of the review that said soft body. It does have a soft body, but the arms and legs are rigid vinyl. Nice, but not exactly what I expected. It IS well constructed, however, and has a sweet face."
5,Super cute!,"So cute! She has the cutest face, great hair and cute little sweatsuit outfit with shoes! She will be a hit this Christmas! Very cute doll for a great price! Highly recommend!"
2,You must have the correct type of toilet seat/lid for this to work,"They don't tell you this in the product specs: This product attaches to the toilet by a large bolt that goes down through the toilet lid/seat hinge, the riser, and through the toilet itself which is then tightened with a wing nut. If your existing toilet lid/seat does not have a hinge that allows a bolt to pass through it (mine did not), you'll have to purchase another toilet lid/seat in order to use this product. I haven't used the product yet (I'm on my way now to purchase a new lid/seat now) so I can't say whether I like it or not, but I certainly don't like buying products online that don't provide specific requirements for use."
4,Better for cleaning!,"Having had 3 joint replacements, I have become accustomed to the comfortable height of these raised seats. I installed one new toilet that fits ADA requirements, but That bathroom was getting renovated anyway. So for the second bathroom, I chose to switch over from my previous riser because it was impossible to clean. Because this seat is hinged, you can get under it and thoroughly sanitize it without unscrewing it. Why only four stars? The screws still need tightening regularly or the seat wobbles. But As an alternative to the very expensive toilets, this choice is the best."
4,Fastening Ceiling Tiles,"I have been using this fastener for about 4 weeks to fasten ceiling tiles and it has only jamed once which was easy to correct. The jam happened just before it ran out of staples, so now I load it just before it runs out. It has worked very well for me."
1,Arrow Electric Staple Gun,"This is a great little electric staple gun. I wanted to re-cover my dining room chairs and this little staple gun works like a charm. The reason I picked this particular stapler was another buyer's review which praised it's performance and stated that it's made in the USA. American made, that sold me on it.Arrow Fastener ETF50BN Electric Staple Gun"
1,All arrow staplers stink,"I have never owned an arrow stapler that could last for more than 6 months of steady use, NEVER! They usually just get jammed all the time, but recently I had a hammer tacker that broke for no reason, (unless they aren't suppose to be used as a stapler), (maybe they are for wall ornaments or paper weights). I will say this though, if you do buy one you will enjoy it for the first month or so, but just remember be gentle with it, it is a arrow stapler after all! Maybe I am misreading the label... Oh yeah, my bad, I've been buying the arrow ""disposable"" staplers."
1,Didn't make it through the first day!,"Didn't make it through the first day! I thought that maybe Arrow would make a great stapler only to end up disappointed. After using it for about an hour and a half and about 50 staples it just quit working. I was using it on a good work table stapling soft wood (Pine). Also I didn't mind the short cord (about 6-8"") but it is a little annoying having the plug at your wrist."
2,Good but not that good,"I have had this straightener for a few years now. I would use it maybe once a or twice a week. I used to think it did a good job. It does heat up quickly. I've never had problems with the light flickering and going off on me. But when I started trying to use it a lot, I noticed that it would pull on my hairs. There are gaps in the plastic that holds the plates together and my hair is FREQUENTLY getting caught in it. I end up pulling my hair out.Anyway, I had my hair straightened after getting it cut a few months ago. The stylist, using a much better iron, got my hair the silkiest I have EVER felt. I didn't even know my hair could look so good. This iron doesn't even come close. I am getting rid of this cheap one for a better one. I have decided that I am willing to pay more for an iron that makes my hair more beautiful and won't pull out hair."
2,not too happy... :(,"Hi,...I had to return this hair straightener in three weeks after I bought it. I wasn't too happy with it,..infact I bought it at a very good price of 14.99 from Fry's electronics,...it worked great the first two weeks I was so happy that my hair looked great and all, however all of sudden the heating stopped,...it would heat up and after I was done straightening about one quarters of my hair, the heat totally died down from hot to warm, and it didn't have any effect on my hair.I thought may be the thermostat turned off and it would turn back on again,...but NO!! it was gone! I had to return it,..thinking about buying the other one by VS, but not sure after reading the review,...could anyone make any suggestions?"
1,Say Hello to split ends and fried hair,"This iron is good for getting the hair straight, but along with that comes the harmful effects of metal straightening irons, were talking frizz, damage, and split ends galore. These metal irons really arent healthy for one who does some serious straightening, ones who just run in through maybe once a week they are ok, but if u constantly straighten your hair, stay away from this iron. ..."
4,died,"I love this product. I'm a little confused because I loved it SO MUCH until it just died on me. Same as all the other reviews said, the red light flickers, and just goes off. But for the first year (with not regular use) it was excellent. I'll probably just order another."
1,Not very good,"Knowingly buying a used book is risky based on somone elses grading. I have bought several listed as very good and was very happy with the purchase, this was not the case with the American Gardens book. It came with no dust jacket as pictured the pages looked water damaged and yellowed should have been rated fair to good tops. Disappointed with this one."
3,Great taste ok price,"I have to say, as far as taste its a 5 stare. Though i was expecting 1 lb of fireballs would be more then what it is."
2,Not the original,These are not the original Atomic Fireballs. They are small and not so hot. Still looking for the original ones.
4,A lot for your money,I was surprised when these came how many there were. Maybe my mind didn't grasp how much 1 lb of Atomic Fireballs would be or look like but they were definitely a hit at my house.
2,Somewhat disappointing,I received a jar of Fire Balls as a gift and it made me realize how much I like them....so I ordered some more. These are not that hot. It takes several minutes in your mouth to get any cinnamon/fire flavor. You can also bite these and they crumble...I wouldn't buy these again.
2,Not That HOT!!,"I used to love Fireballs as a kid, but these are very different then the Fireballs 10-15 years ago. They are smaller, and not that hot at all. I used to not be able to keep a ball in my mouth for the whole time, I would have to spit it out because it the ball was too hot. They also can be chewed pretty easily, which was not common for them back in the day."
5,Yummy,Love Atomic Fireballs but usually only find them in a variety pack at Halloween time. Was delighted to find a bag of just Fireballs. Yummy hot little goodies.
2,A Missed Opportunity!,"This book is a missed opportunity to really explain and show why James Beard was such an influential figure. The writing is tiresome, both oddly distant and overly cozy (for instance, calling the subject ""James"" instead of the usual journalistic ""Beard""). It's a laborious gathering of facts rather than a compelling biography. You can tell there's good material here, but it never fully comes to life."
4,"Needed it for a class, arrived on time and in excellent (new) condition",I only gave it four stars because I have not read it yet but as always it arrived on time and in the condition that was described. I am happy!
4,The Best Work on Slavery,"Quite simply, no other book on the history of slavery or its impacts has ever been written. This is a profound look at bondage and what it means to, not only break those bonds, but to live with them and retain humanity."
1,Do Not waste your money on this vacuum.,I was excited to get this vacuum because we really needed a new one. I wish I had researched it before I made the purchase. The very first time we used it the suction decreased dramatically. We had to take the vacuum apart and wash the filter screen and it had good suction until we had vacuumed another room and as soon as any dust gets in the filter screen the vacuum has no suction. You can't use the hand tools because there is not enough suction to pick up anything with them. You have to take the vacuum apart and wash the filter foam and screen to get another half vacuuming out of it. This product was a big disappointment. I emailed Dirt Devil about this problem and got no response from them. I guess their customer service is about as good as their product.
4,Decent Vac for the $$,"Finally...a long cord on a vacuum!!Powerful suction, I love the handle, easy to manuever.We have two black labs with LOTS of hair (and white carpeting) and this sucks it all up great! I'm not sure why the previous reviews were so negetive?For the gal who had the vacuum suck up her small carpet mat...you need to adjust the floor height on the vacuum for that...to the one who can't open the cannister?? I do not have a problem. Sure, the filters get dirty after use, and lose suction but, all vaccums do that and you need to clean them - that's why they are washable!! Why does everyone think a vacuum doesn't need cleaning?? Truly, no problems with this dirt devil over here and we vacuum once a day!"
1,Ugh.,"The other reviewers aren't kidding about this vacuum cleaner spitting dirt back on you. Vacuum wearing shoes unless you want dirty feet! Ridiculous. It definitely works better if you bang all the dust out of the filter, but good grief. My long hair has completely killed the brushroll, too. Wimpy machine."
1,The Worst Vacuum I've Ever Used,"Like the title says, this is the worst vacuum I've ever used. The suction is okay at first, but the problem is that the vacuum gets clogged within minutes, and so really soon, it starts spitting back all the dirt and pet hair that you have vacuumed right back onto the floor. It doesn't actually suck anything up. I have to go back and pick up the mess by hand or use a broom. It's uselessly heavy (considering its ineffectiveness), and if you even jostle it a little, the filters fall out of alignment and you have to fix them again. The attachments also don't work and just basically scrub the dirt around on the floor. The only good things about it that I can see are that it has a very long power cord (32 feet), and various settings for the kind of floor or carpet you're vacuuming. But if it doesn't clean, then what's the use? I would give this negative stars if I could. It's just that bad. Shame on you Dirt Devil, for swindling people out of $80."
2,"Not the best, but not the absolute worst either...","I've had this thing for almost a year. At first, I was satisfied. It seemed to clean really well. But, I noticed after vacuuming my home just twice, there was a dramatic loss of suction power. The filter at the top of the dust cup is the culprit - if you don't take it out and clean it every time you empty this machine, you will not have any suction. Even after cleaning the filter, it loses suction about halfway through vaccuming my home. Also, not impressed with the ""turbo"" hand tool - I have to use a lint roller to get the rest of the pet hair off of my couch when I'm done vacuuming it. All in all, I don't like it. I want something else...I'm thinking about going for a Kenmore or Hoover canister..."
4,Works for me,"I have had my vacuum for a few months with little disappointment. Works great on my carpets and hard wood floors. No problems picking up bird seed or dog hair. Power brush attachment doesn't have any ""power"" to it, but aside from that a very good light duty vac."
1,"Programed not to open ""BLOCKED""","Same problem as many others. The month after warranty expired it wouldn't open and said ""BLOCKED"". I called and was told to unplug it and press ""ON"" when replugging. ""BLOCKED"" again came up. It does not even have screws you can unscrew yourself without special tool. I lost hours of recordings when it would shut itself off during record or play modes! Over priced even if it did work for more than a few months.I'll NEVER buy Magnavox again because of bad product and run around service guy who said ""It is probably past warranty, they all should be"" It shouldn't have been on the market."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,I bought this toy as a xmas present for my daughter. It lasted six days! It will randomly stop playing her cds after a certain amount of seconds. It was her favorite part of the radio and now she can't even use it!!
4,Worth buying it!,A good buy. Product was a gift and the person who received the gift was pleased with it. I would recommend.
2,"Not a good book to learn ,but you get free 60-day tryout edition","This book is not good for anyone.It has very few practice excerises and it skips lot of necessary steps which you have to figure it out by trail and error method.I found it very bugging .You get a 60 day trail version ,but the catch is it's a student version and has less capability than a commercial one.According to me it's waste of money and time.Even though you get a CD-ROM ,I recommed to browse other books on market that has free trail version than buying this book just for the software."
2,Not good enough,Well there are some nice tangos on the CD but a tango master would have sequenced them better!! I found it very distracting that the mood and tempo changed and seemsed to have no real structure to it.
5,Great First Season for a SitCom,I never watched this show because it was a TV SitCom.This spring I caught a snippet from the show as I was channel surfing.I was rolling on the floor. I watched several syndicated episodes and laughed.I bought it for my wife for Valentines Day. We both enjoy this series.It beat flowers and chocolate.If you never saw the series this is the only place to start.
5,Umm... an AMAZING show!,"Give Scrubs a chance! Once I started watching it I was completely hooked. It can make you laugh and cry in the same episode. Scrubs has the uncanny ability to make serious, socially-conscious points, but also provide hilarious comic-relief. This show makes me really happy and I bet it'll make you happy too!!"
5,Outstanding,"Simply put, one of greatest comides to be on television in the last 10 years. The staff at Sacred Heart will make you laugh inside and out."
5,Scrubs is GREAT!,Everyone I know loves scrubs. My whole family comes over to watch it! We cant wait for the second season to come out so we can buy it!
5,V Funny... Grows on you,"The first time i saw this show, i was a little lost. I found it funny but i didnt follow the story line. But after seeing a few more episodes and watching the first season on DVD im a fan. Mind it, the show is outrageous and over the top, but the cast does a great job and the writing is hilarious.I look forward to seeing other episodes on DVD."
4,Nice Change of Pace,"I love the medical dramas, but still enjoyed this nice break in pace. If you're looking for a serious show, this is not it. It's a nice change of pace from all the typical shows out there:)"
2,Alright,The case was pretty scratched up and the DVD's are very scratched. I've only watched 1 DVD and it worked alright but the other 2 disc's are worse off but I haven't watched those as of it.
5,Such an underrated comedy - so funny,"When this first came out, my wife (then girlfriend) was a first year medical student. All of her professors and other people in the hospital told her that Scrubs is the best representation of how intern life will be (ahhhh!!!!). Sure it was exaggerated, but it was very close. Now she is herself an intern and we just started watching the first season DVD. She can relate to nearly everything that JD, Turk, and Elliott go through. It's such a funny and underrated show. To think that it almost was canceled by NBC in the early years (I think?). If you've never seen Scrubs, buy this set. If you have seen most episodes, like us, buy this set."
5,Genious,"Scrubs is absolute pure humoristic genious. GENIOUS!!! That's it for me, though.. no time for dilly dally."
5,scrubs,"a must for any scrubs fan! aboslutely hysterical, great to watch by yourself or with a group of friends!!"
5,Quirky humor and sometimes a little sad,"I started watching scrubs in the middle of the 1st season. And I continued to watch it. This season I only really got to see about the 1st month of it cause then I started to work on Tuesday nights so I pretty much missed every episode of this season and im waiting to watch the reruns. And when I heard season 1 was coming out I was like I gotta get it. I saw that best buy was giving an extra disc with it that contained more deleted scenes and outtakes some other stuff so I bought it there. Its funny but its very, very, very underrated. Pretty much how Seinfeld was when it 1st started. The first 3 seasons nobody really watched and it wasnt in the top 10 or 20 but when NBC moved Seinfeld to Thursday nights after Cheers thats when it became a hit in its 4th season. So Scrubs is going into its 5th season but wont be starting until midseason. But its all good. Sarah Chalke and Judy Reyes are hot."
5,The beginning,"I got to say, it's a great place to start...this is where you fall in love with the characters and follow their lives. It's a great series and if you have never watched SCRUBS (is there anyone out there who COULD resist?) you are really missing out. Try it, I guarantee you'll be hooked after 1 maybe 2 episodes."
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I've only seen one episode of ""Scrubs"" prior to buying this DVD set. But after viewing all of the episodes, I'm definitely hooked! The characters and storylines are top notched. Definitely a must-buy if you're into fast-paced offbeat sitcoms."
5,One of my favorites,"This show is one of my favorites. I've wanted to buy the DVDs for some time but none were ever available. Now they are and I'm so happy. This series is great, it is warm, moving and funny. Zach Braff is great in ever episode. All the characters fit throughout the series. I never watched this show until the 3rd season and now I TIVO ever episode so I don't miss it. Buy this DVD if you want laughs and everything else a sitcom can give you."
1,Broken and melting,The package arrived in a ripped envelope.I had hoped to use for part of wedding favors. They arrived broken and melted.You would think they would know how to package.
4,Way cool,"Going with the orchestra was an experiment that worked well, only on one or two tracks is the sound a little bit obtrusive, and it's a real plus on some tracks, especially the bluesy tone on St James Infirmary. Arlo's voice has gotten better as he's aged, and this CD reeks of class."
5,T he Best of the Best......,"This is a release that blends the strong Folk message Arlo's been known for with a Blues flavor, in a Classical music backdrop that is nothing short of Fantastic. His voice blends and unties with the music into one seamless work. His rendition of ""Goodnight Irene"" makes you want to cry as you really listen to the lyrics.It is a MUST buy/have across all types of music styles."
4,Another Step,"I've been a fan of Arlo's from the get-go, but haven't purchased an album in quite some time. When I read about this release on Expecting Rain I thought I'd give it a go, and the surprise has been pleasant. Folk singers and symphony orchestras may seem like over-reaching, but this work is a positive step in a new direction. The songs fit the arrangements and vice versa. A few of them are quite moving, and St. James Infirmary is nothing short of stunning in it's mixture of verbal pathos, and musical wit - and Arlo's guitar work is terrific. My only complaint is the sameness of so many of the tunes - a little more variety, and maybe a few up-tempo numbers wouldn't have hurt."
5,Well Made Rule,This rule is accurate and the lettering is well defined and easy to read. I recommend this rule for anyone requiring 1/64th of an inch precision.
4,Not for all applications.,"This tool might be a little too thin & fragile for some applications, but worth the price. It works well for setting up guitars."
4,i am happy with it,"very straight and durable, just needs a magnifying glass to read most of the measurements, but overall pretty happy with it."
4,Steel Ruler,"This is a simple, but decent steel rule that will last a long time with your various DIY and hobby requirements. A tape measure is often useful for larger measurements, but for smaller items a good measuring rule is invaluable. If you use a plastic rule with a Stanley/craft knife there is a risk that you will slice through the rule into your fingers and also the edge can get marked and ragged. A good metal rule will prevent this and will last a great deal longer in your workshop. The indices on this are machined well and it is easy to read off the scale. This is inexpensive and invaluable in the long run when you need to measure smaller items around the home and workshop.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Average and Inch only,"I had foolishly not considered that a US made rule would only have inch measures. I'm used to both inch and metric, I use both.The rule flexes, but does not flex back flat. It arrived flexed ... bit dissapointing."
3,bent,This is not a very flexible scale..but for the price it did the job. I bent it trying to measure something and now it will not stay straight.
3,-ok-,this is an ok case- there are tonz cuter ones thats for sure but overall it protected my ipod pretty good- the screen gets really dusty though and i wish it was in a cuter color! but overall it was ok
1,Short stories not Agatha Christie's forte,"Murder in the Mews is made up of three mystery short stories. The first is ""ok""; the second is really lame. The third I didn't finish, due to the fact that the disc was badly scratched (I got this from the library). Usually when that happens, I will repair the disc so as to continue; however, based upon the lackluster quality of these stories, and the lackluster quality of another collection of Agatha Christie's short stories that I listened to, I figured that the third story would not be worth the effort of repairing the disc.I suppose that mystery short stories are a difficult form to write; at any rate, even the masterful Agatha Christie could not master them."
1,Poor remasterization,I can't believe how an old record company like RCA has placed a product with tracks full of clicks & pops and other noises NOT PROPERLY from a cd. I DO NOT RECOMMEND A PRODUCT ESPECIALLY IF YOU PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO BUY IT.
3,You've Gotta be FAST to play this game !!!!,"A bit of a disappointment, but fun! The numbers are called out so fast, that you need to be ready and fast to play this game....I hadn't expected it to this way, but we played it and enjoyed it, but definately wish there was a speed control to it! Much better than boards & bingo chips all over...."
3,too fast bingo-slow down!,We were very happy to find an adult video version of bingo but we were unable to follow. The game is much to fast. Is there a way to slow it down. Our group really wants to play this but we cannot keep up with the caller. Any suggestions?
5,All I wanted to know and then some.,"This is quite simply the most comprehensive resource available in print. From equipment to technique to training to the physics of skating, Publow puts it all in one volume. There are drills to help the skater learn what the proper form should feel like and there are in-depth explanations of the physiology involved with the movements. While this wouldn't be the book I'd recommend for a beginning skater (See Liz Miller's books) it should be the first choice for the ice or inline skater who wants to refine his technique and analyze the details that will make him a stronger, faster skater. A note of caution. Some of the diagrams in the plyometrics section may require several readings to make the most of them."
5,The greatest resource a speedskater could ask for,"For years, speedskaters have lived on 15 year old books and magazine articles for technique and training tips. Now, there is one great resource for skate knowledge. Without going too deep for non-kinesiologists, Publow explains how and why everything speedskaters do works. He manages to show in photographs the basic components that we all need to learn and perfect to be great skaters. The drills for improving technique range from simple to genius. The book will warrant many, many re-reads to learn and understand more each time."
3,Speed on Skates,Good reference book. A little dated in terms of skate technology but great for workout and conditioning information. Has useful drills with training aids.
5,Give us more of the same,"I bought my first copy of ""Bottom Belle"" some two months after the CD was released. The cuts from this CD make for both great listening and dancing. However, I do not hear any reggae or soukkous sounds in the CD as the first reviewer in Amazon.com claimed and as is being advertized. I hear authentic Nigerian highlife of the late 50's and 60's vintage with enriched instrumentation and vocals. I loved this and have since bought 3 additional copies as gifts to friends. A friendly challenge: which of the cuts contain reggae and or soukkous sounds? Anyway, keep up the good work and produce more of the remake of these classic oldies."
2,For Children,This book is intended for very young children. It is 24 pages in length and uses very large print.
2,"""LP"" Killed the ""EP"" Star.","Early November's EP, For all of this, was an instant classic for me. Every song is good, catchy, and have great lyrics and stucture. After hearing ""Room's Too Cold"", their debut LP, I was extremely disappointed. With the exception of track 4, and sometimes 2 and 3 (depending on what mood I am in) the songs on this record aren't even worth listening to all the way through. Dont get me wrong, this cd isnt horrible (not to be confused with Courtney Love's record), but it isnt good. It is trapped somewhere in the middle in an area I like to call ""bland."" If you really want to know what Early November is capable of, pick up their EP, ""For all of this"" and forget that they even have an LP."
3,"Theyre okay..., everyone is being limited","Bands are being like limited, drive thru records have been comin out with the same bands over and over, same songs over and over, same voice and same rythym even other labels are trying to be like drive thru because of how drive thru is actually succeeding how long will it last?... i mean i like emo/punk and stuff but i wanna hear something new to make the emo/punk experience more thrilling, if you like this great i do in some ways too... but i think if you like this you'd enjoy The June Spirit even more, but atleast the early november are somewhere my band hasnt doen anythin for the last month... better get something done soon, well have a nice rest of the day"
3,it all depends on...,"The new ten cd is great... if you like soft indie rock. the music stands out as being original and having well thought out sound organization and lyrics. all of the songs roll smoothly over the lister's ears. Some of the standout tracks are "" something that produces results"",""ever so sweet"", and ""sesame,shemshame"".however i happen to be an enormous fan of their debut ep -- ""for all of this"". the variety on the new cd is not near as great as the e.p. it also lacks loud rock tracks which were present on the e.p.for the best of ten, get the e.p. if you dig dashboard, get ""the room's too cold""."
3,not too shabby,"Excellent CD. 'Ever So Sweet' has been stuck in my head for days. It's definitely one of the stand-out tracks. I don't feel that this release was quite as cohesive as the 'For All of This EP'. FAoT seemed to have a tighter feel. This album is longer, though, and the band has definitely matured (a good thing). Three stars is a very good rating - I'm not the kind of person who gives something 5 stars just because I like it. If you are a fan of the band, the label, or the genre, this CD is well worth your time. If you are listening to TEN for the first time, I suggest their EPs (FAoT and the Acoustic one, avail. only thru their website)."
2,Emo at it's worst,"Just saw these guys live, and they were just shy of horrible. Figured I would give their album a chance, however. Unfortunately this is not one of those bands that is terrible live and good recorded. They sound a bit like a really really bad Midtown. Their songs are uninspiring at best."
1,"seriously, listen","i can stand certain bands that fall into the same sound as TEN, brand new, TBS, Mae, but that doesn/t make them good. The problem with this album is that i have heard it done (and done well) by the afforementioned artists, this album would have been okay in 95' when the midwestern 'emo' wave was at it/s peak, but to release this now is just a disgrace.The band is definatly talented, both musically and lyrically, but it/s just very boring stuff, go out and buy a boy/s life or christie front drive record if you want 'emo', what kind of musical era are we in when bands are quoting The Get Up Kids in their songs (see Baby Blue ""I don/t want you to love me anymore); it/s just sad really.Do yourself a favor, stop listening to all the bands you see in the 'similar artists' section, and go buy yourself a Rites of Spring or Embrace record, at least if you/re going to listen to whinny crap, it will be stuff that can actually pass for 'emo'."
2,Could be better,"Well another failure for Drive-Thru Records. Can they bring any more? This album had mediocre lyrics with yet ANOTHER punk voice that sounds like a 13 yr old. If you took 98% of the bands on this record label and played each of their voices back to back I think you will think they all sound the same, which they do. I guess now thats the popular thing to do, instead of imitating Pearl Jam, now every band wants to sound like pop punk. What a shame...For any band out their wanting to get signed try not to go to a sell out record company like Drive-Thru!"
1,Bah!,"Emo is completely gay,I wish it all would go away.Everyone should listen to Slayer,And agree you have no prayer.The ""guys"" in these are so very ""femme""And I hope our Lord, Satan, eats them.Finis."
1,we need a new holocaust,any band with a season or month in their name needs to be put to death. taking back fall out autumns sunday november boy need to stop. they will never be weezer or sunny day real estate and they need to realize this. only fat girls with no friends listen to this garbage.
4,4 1/2,"This cd is good...but there's some intentional flaws that just shouldn't happen. First off, I'm sorry, but this guys vocals are terrible. He needs to do more than one cut, and even though I don't like them, put some harmonized vocals behind him, like in FAOT. However, the songs are great, besides number 1. Number 6, 8, and 10 are stand-out tracks to me. I'm not saying this is a bad cd, but I feel they kind of went backwards from FAOT. Good job though, and try to focus on the faster side."
3,not the best,"If your looking for anther stand out song like ""Every nights another story"" and ""Take time and find""... then you will probably be dissapointed with this cd. Most of the songs are slow with boring guitar riffs. There aren't really any stand out tracks because even the faster songs are a bit boring. The reason I began liking these guys was because of their strong lyrics and good guitar riffs. However it seems like they focused more on the lyrics than the sound of the song. Still a good cd, just a little disappointing."
5,Amazing band... great breakthroughs,"The Early November is so amazing! This cd is great and I can't wait to see them this Wednesday.. This is the 2nd time seeing them in a couple months and 3rd in a year... their progression from For All of This and The Acoustic EP is amazing... They really have evolved as a band, and its great to continue to listen to them.. Sleep Patterns Changes is a great song... The Course of Human life with the strings is amazing.. and of course Ken Vasoli's guest appearence is great... But I mean since I did see both Starting Line and Early November together I am partial.. This band is going to go very far with there career and I hope to listen to them as long as it is.. Keep up the great work.. And the Room's Too Cold is something anyone that likes emo/punk should have...Great work Ace"
4,Switching Up,"This Cd is great. I preordered offline about two weeks ago and got it last friday and ahvent stopped listening to it since. The first song has a little country kind of feel to it so while the lyrics are good I dont like the guitar too much, but songs like ""Baby Blue"" ""Something That Produces Results"" are amazing whats more incredible is the bands ability to switch from soft emo acoustic guitars to fast apced punk rock. They do it seamlessly and its good to ehar a band that isnt afraid to alternate acoustic tracks and electric. I recomend this Cd if you like Something Corporate, Dashboard Confessional, or Finch."
3,Could have and should have been expanded upon.,"This was not the type of hidden object game I thought it may be. Too much repetition and simple game play. No really ""hidden"" objects. ""Match three"" gamers may like it better. The graphics are good, though. Different scenery might have inproved this game a bit. After all, it IS called ""Mystery of Shark Island"", the descriptive word being ""island"" and not ""waves""."
2,Mystery Of Shark Island,"Did not care too much for this game. I love the hidden object games, but this one fell short. I like to find ""different"" objects, this one was the same one, just different shapes and colors.I was disappointed, overall....."
4,Mystery of Shark Island,I found this game hard because of the small pieces and the short time. I finally worked through it but had to repeat some findings several time. If you don't give up easy or have very good eye sight and work fast this is the game. Will play it again to see if I can beat the odds.
4,Holmes filters,These filters work as advertised. They remove 99% of the dust in the air and also filter out odors and pet hair. Easy to clean with a vacuum.
1,Not what advertised,I ordered two packages of the above replacement filters. The package was advertised to have two filters in each package as they had been when I ordered before. What I received was two filters.
5,Great product,I use these in the air filters for the bedrooms in my home. We have allergies and this is a great product for us!
3,Price is to high,"these filters work great but are too expensive, can't afford to buy every 6 months."
3,won't buy on amazon,"Normally I can find the same quality items at cheaper prices on Amazon. Not the case with this product. It was what I needed for my air filter, but I can get a 2 pack at Target for $39.99. I thought I was getting a good deal and ended up not to be the case after shipping."
4,"From Damo , Dig The cover , Great Art Work.","Stay ,what can I say. The debut is more so English , rock , folk , progressive rock.As the lps developed from 1970 t0 1977 , things took on a new shape and formmoving toward a more commercial sound as most bands did from that era.Stand up and be counted fuses alot of recording ideas together. Some tracks looseout in places , but most Stand up not un like the name of the lbum.The band have a rare beauty in places in terms of song writing ability.I had listened to some of their early period but this has soul and a little hill billybelieve it or not. Grab it and buy the debut ""Stray"" , its by far the most creativework. They are a band worth discovering and easy to listen to."
3,Helpful IEP book,This book is helpful in gaining more knowledge about LD and IEPs. Unfortunately not all public school have read this book or care to follow the suggestions in it. Wish they did.A good book for parents new to the daunting task of advocating for their child's FAPE.
3,Lots of Information and Details,"Unfortunately, as a special education teacher there is not much new here. This book will certainly be helpful to parents of students with learning disabilities, but as a teacher looking for ways to expedite my IEP meetings it was lackluster.A lot of pages were spent on the laws surrounding special education. I am more concerned about the actual child. I would have liked to have seen more examples of exemplary IEP goals in all the performance areas (reading, writing, math, daily living/adaptive skills, etc.) Instead I got page after page of due process laws and every other law imaginable.Overall, this is a helpful book that I will share with my student's parents in the coming school year, as needed. Other than that I will look elsewhere to find a book that will help me write a more effective IEP which will, in turn, benefit my students."
2,This is more of a TECHNICAL GUIDE not a Practical Guide.,"This book has many good items in it that help you understand what you should look for in pixcel size and other features. It also goes over the different applications. The key issue is that this is too Technical. I am a Computer Science person, and I found it too technical. I would prefer to see more set up, exposer issues, tracking hardware, tricks and tips. I expected more at a different level with a title that had ""Practical"" in it."
1,Worked for a few staples,"I bought this product because I needed to do a low voltage lighting job in trees, The product arrived quick so I very happy about that. When I went to use it it shot a few staples then quit I would try to unload the staples and try again but it just wouldn't work consistently so I packaged it back up and sent it back for a refund, I ended up using romax staples instead which took way more time and a loss of money"
1,Wasn't Pleased,"Usually VS Sasson is a good brand but this one I was not happy with one. I didn't straighten at all, even after I blew out the hair. Didn't flatten or defrizz. I do not reccomend."
2,Not Good!,This straightener only has 170 watts of heating power. That is not a very good number! If you want salon-straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts... especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair!
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive. What it boils down to is that this is a ""foot hook"" tied to a bar with a nylon strap. The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly. The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down. I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room. Negative on both accounts. You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down."
2,Who Knew?,"When I ordered this I thought all harmonica performances were alike. I was wrong!I LOVE the Harmonicats so I ordered this CD but what I got was mostly music by Borrah Minevitch whose harmonica renditions sound like cartoon backround music. Maybe that's what he is known for-I don't know, I only know that I was disappointed in the style of his music.When the Harmonicats' selections come on (#19-22) you can hear the difference. Now THOSE guys knew how to arrange and play real music for real people.Sorry but this is not what I expected and I'm sticking to only music by the very talented Harmonicats who knew how to make a song an unforgetable experience."
1,Easy to see through Michael Moore,"I thought this movie was nothing but weak entertainment. If this movie pursuades anyone's vote this November, then those people need to stop relying on the media to tell them the ""truth."" I thought it was interesting how Moore mentioned that Bush spent most of his time on his ranch and not running the country. I thought it was funny that one of the clips showed Tony Blair with Bush ""hanging out at his Ranch."" Bush said it himself in the film that it is possible to do his job outside to Oval Office, the same as Clinton doing his job from Camp David most of the time. There is plenty more I would like to point out, but I'm not real sure how much space I have to write on this thing. Regardless, I didn't like this movie and I think that Michael Moore needs to search outside of Kent Mighigan for concrete evidence of absolutely nothing."
1,Horrible Movie,Michael Moore is an insult to America. He is very manpipulative and distorts the truth on way to many aspects of american life. He has no right to go and lie to the public about our government. I would not reccommend this movie to anybody!
1,Anti American Garbage from Fat Boy,"Michael Moore does it again. Presents a ""Documentary"" filled with lies and Anti Americanism.He should be ashamed but I am sure he is not."
4,i can't complain it was good,i purchased this DVD and i was very impressed. it was worth the $ and i would definitely recommend to a friend.jim
1,Big Let Down,"I thought this would be a good movie showing ALL the details of 911 not just from one stand point. As in any situation there are three sides of the story. Thiers, ours, and the full truth. I bought the DVD to watch and ended up burning it in the fire. Not because of the content more because of our men and women fighting over there. Like stated ""This is another Vietnam"" My father was in that war and I thank god every day that he came home to me only to have people calling him a baby killer. COME ON PEOPLE. we need to support our men and women in any way needed and let them know we stand behind them and give them out stength. Peace to all and prayers to brother and sisters of war may god walk with you."
2,"""Unbiased""","A documentary should be an unbiased FULL look at the truth. The American Public needs to realize that Michael Moore is simply a voice with a slightly biased look on our American President. Why do I get the feeling that everyone who is writing these reviews are voicing their own hatred for Mr. Bush. Bush could have definitely done somethings different but instead of further pushing the gap between America, voice your opinion by voting."
1,I wanted to call 911,"Call 911 and report this crime against humanity !More bull from the maker of leftist political radical tripe. When will he quit victimizing all Americans?It is always sad to see this kind of exploitation of families and victims,especially when it is done to advance the agenda of a sick individual.We should deport all those involved in these kind of scams."
3,Brilliant Opportunist Ficumentary,I had the chance to view the movie for the first time on 9/23/04. I thought it was well done but contained a lot of fiction for a so called documentary. I recommend it only if you do your homework on the issues before watching the movie. If you choose to watch the movie before you do your research accept most information as fiction until your homework is done. Michael Moore is also a brilliant opportunist. He knows the sheep on the right and the left will either be outraged or in love with his movie. WHICH MEANS BIG BUCKS FOR HIM.
1,What happened to journalistic integrity?,"If you watch this you should atleast give the other side a chance by reading some of the criticisms of the movie. Moore is notorious for lying and misstating; this movie is no exception.""Hoorah"" for trying to bring the man down. [...] for being shadey while doing it."
2,What was all the fuss about?,"A strangely dull and unsurprising effort, given all the publicity. Right from the start I could see this was going to be far too biased and misleading to be taken seriously. Moore's efforts to discredit the Bush regime are pretty laughable in places. Then again, footage of Iraqi civilians killed and injured by the American army are powerful and moving, and interviews with soldiers who seem to find the whole thing ""awesome"" and a ""rush"" really do stir the anti-American, anti-war sentiments. All the more confusing when, after showing them to be such a brainless and dislikable bunch, the film turns into a tribute to the soldiers and the sacrifices they make. It all peters out rather disappointingly. Still, Bush does come across as a bit of an idiot, and you wouldn't trust that Rumsfeld chap to make a cup of tea. Just a shame Moore has to twist things round so much to fit his 'message'. Still, better than a kick up bum."
1,"Most deceitful ""documentary"" I've ever seen.","Please be responsible and research why so many people/journalists are saying that this movie is so deceitful. I've seen this movie and researched the facts, read the reports and have come to the conclusion that Moore is trying to fool all of you into believing these lies. Search on google for ""59 deceits in fahrenheit 911"", Kopel put together a comprehensive list of deceits backed up with facts. I pointed this site out to one of my misguided leftist friends and he said he felt ""duped"" by Fahrenheit 9/11. And be fair, watch FahrenHYPE 9/11 as well and then make up your mind. If you don't like Bush then at least have some intelligent arguments, don't be another ignorant person falling for Moore's lies while he makes a half a billion dollars worldwide."
1,"Entertainment - not ""truth""","Moore is great at what he does: Spinning a series of video clips to match his personal view of the issue. This movie is no exception. It's not at all a documentary, and if you know that, and loath/hate George Bush, and don't like to research the facts of a situation, but let a filmmaker with a hardcore view of the world dictate your views to you, you'll love this movie. LOVE it."
1,"It takes ""objective"" to a whole new level that is below all!","Be warned, this movie has facts, just like every bit of news and every documentary out there. BUT he has twisted them to bend to his will instead of objectively reporting the facts- he just hates Bush and Americans and that's what I get out of watching the movie. This movie was MADE to polarise the nation even more- makes Bush haters more hateful and thereby making Bush lovers love him more. I mean, if so many people who were actually interviewed by him feel betrayed by his fat ass because he twisted what they said, I think that speaks for itself. He's a liar. He's fat. And c'mon- he looks like the geek from High school that everyone beat on- and now he's getting his laughs because a lot of people believe his $20 pack of lies.If you buy this movie do yourself a favor and buy FarenHYPE 9/11 as well because then you will probably be more on the right track, since both movies are to the extremes."
4,Dumb rebulicans hate F/911,"This is a funny movie that is entertaining to watch. But Bush lovers bash this movie so much that it's getting annoying. It seems that you either love the movie or you hate it. Which is starting all these arguements. If you are a Bush lover, simply do not buy this DVD. You will only ***** and moan."
1,Moore hates america and freedom.,"Micheal Moore made me vomit while watching this movie. America would be a better place if he left here, which he should because he obviously doesn't appreciate everything that his country does for him. His extremely one sided argument has no historical value, and it a piece of brainwashing propaganda that he made in attempt to try to convince more people to hate that country that gives them so much."
1,Half-Truths and Blatant Lies,"The truth is that this is nowhere close to an accurate, objective documentary. It attempts to bash President Bush without realizing he has implemented successful and beneficial policies while in office. No president has been perfect. Many presidents have had to make the tough pronouncement of war. Michael Moore has no respect for the country or what the president has on his shoulders, and it comes through in this film. I wholeheartedly ask you to not consider this as truth or as the whole picture."
1,ZERO stars for Left Wing Lies,"Bush was not the best President, but this hateful clown does not care what lies he puts forth as truths. If you do not enjoy being lied to over and over, be sure and skip this one."
4,The truth (or at least part of it ) finally revealed,"First off, THIS IS NOT A BIAST REVIEW!This movie, or more like a story, as many pros, only to be balanced out with many cons.PROS: >A glimpse of war in soldiers' and parents' perspectives>A revelation of some of the truth>Many tear-wrenching momentsCONS: >Packed to the brim with exaggerationOverall, a fine film....P.S. Notice how I don't use the word documentary."
5,Fanstastic Genius Man of Truth,Mike you know you are a special man to tell the truth to the American Public after all these years of StupedMen Lying to the public. It is well appreciated.
2,"Entertaining, but not factual","Having recently re-watched ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", I felt compelled to write a short analysis of Mr. Moore's film.First off, he is a fine filmmaker who can use situations to effectively convey his intentions. He has a good eye for drama, and that must be commended. However, one must remember that this film is drama, not a documentary. It is filled with misrepresentations, and outright lies. Moore frequently takes words out of context to promote his cause: deframing the President.If you are really compelled to find out the actual facts, please check out David Kopel's, a lifelong Democrat, website which chronicles the inaccuracies in Moore's film. www.davekopel.com as this will present to you the deceits in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". As a good American, I feel it is necessary to view both sides of any tale. That is why I recommend every American see both Moore's film as well as ""FarenHYPE 9/11"" and also read what Mr. Kopel has to say in regards to the film."
5,A must see,"F911 is a great movie. I was laughing, crying, and laughing so hard I was crying. It's bias, but so are all political books."
1,"Truth-twisting, Biased Propaganda","If you don't care about the actual truth, enjoy! However, if you are one of those people who can compare different accounts, examine historical evidence and make reasonable judgements, watch Fahrenheit 9/11, watch FahrenHYPE 9/11, and do your own research. If you're capable of reaching reasonable conclusions, you'll see the twisted-truth propagated by Moore, the wild speculation (without any reasonable supporting evidence), his profiteering from this film and the fact that his film should be located under Fiction rather than Documentary. What he presents as FACT is an insult to an educated American society. Watch the films, do your own research and decide for yourself."
1,Garbage,"Moore is a showboater who will present half truths and facts out of context to further his ultra-liberal agenda. If you view this item, view it as fiction."
1,one sided fahrenheit 9/11 debauchery,"After seeing this movie I felt sick of the lies and misleading information slanted towards an extremist personal view and twisted debauchery. I am literally ashamed that someone like Michael Moore exists. One thing I have learned we should call him the PREACHER of HATE! The average people watching his movie I realize now are all followers and NOT Leaders and that is even a bigger shame, who needs the media and Hollywood dictating our lives...I examined several of the scenes and compared them to the true incidence and saw how he cut and twisted the facts. I along with several of my friends here in San Francisco are shocked to see how gullible our society has become and would actually give this move a negative 10!"
1,This Liberal Finds Farenheit a Little Fuzzy...,"I could not like Bush less, or agree with the sentiment of this film more, but I found it's methods irresponsible and sloppy. I am happy that Moore is not making films for the ""other side"" but he need to become more accountable and thorough as he is now only preaching to the choir. There is a slight Conan O'Brien sardonic, aging college boy' irony meets Enquirer tabloid sensibility. Stay with us on the left Michael, but do so with a litlte more responsibility."
1,buy it for a penny .01,the only people giving this movie high marks are does that hope you by this movie from them for a penny .01 save your penny pure garbage cant belive i paid 2.99 to rent this at blockbuster a few years ago !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Micheal Moore's so called ""documentary"" is nothing more than a personal attack...","Michael Moore has something personal against President Bush because this wasn't a documentary, it was a personal attack, and he has no idea of Bush's motives or even the way Bush thinks. I don't agree with everything President Bush has done, but if I were to try and create an anti-Bush documentary, I certainly wouldn't make it so personal with fewer facts than sarcasm."
1,hello...,"this movie is a lie about america, and bush!!! micheal moore should be shot for what he has done to this wonderful country of ours!!! i loath this man!!! i am beyond hate!!! he is evil! he is a terrorist! he is a scum sucking liberal who should be locked away for good! i cannot belive that he would do such a thing to our good, decent, right, justice-built, seeker-of-all-that-is-moral country!!! he has tried and unfortunately succeded in turning this greatest country on Gods green Earth into a laughing stock!!! i will never forgive him for that!!! i wish that he will leave our great country and die so we dont ever have to deal with him anymore!!!micheal moore is almost as bad as FDR, jimmy carter, and bill clinton...he's just a couple of quirks away"
3,It could have been worse!,"Simply, this is a security blanket movie for diluted leftists (as opposed to some of you non-diluted leftists who are reading and rating my review :D). This movie cannot and should not be taken seriously. I only enjoyed the entertainment value, but there is no substance. At times it can be boring, but overall it's interesting to watch.. and it could have been worse... there could have been a Michael Moore nude scene!*shudders*"
1,NOT a Documentary,"If you must see this movie, please go in with the understanding that this is political propaganda and not a documentary. The movie uses your emotions to try and sway you into seeing holes in the administrations policies... etc."
1,He's Fat,"And he's also ugly and stupid. Michael (I hate America, I hate white people) Mooron is one reason I am glad Bush was reelected. I am also glad his film failed to win a single Oscar and that he got kicked out of the Republican National Convention. He also failed to become TIME Magazine's person of the year, guess who became TIME Magazine's person of the year; George W. Bush!They say being on the cover of TIME magazine makes you look fatter. But when you don't fit in the darn thing, does it really matter?"
1,Worthless,"I really enjoyed some of Michael Moore's other works. However he now seems on a vendetta against Bush. He's not even going to let little things like the facts or the truth get in his way....Listen if you hate bush you'll love this movie, However if you actually spend some time checking the fact's you'll see that Moore's movie is more fantasy than reality.Oh and Please stop wearing that MSU hat your giving us spartans a bad name... Why not wear a U of M hat instead????"
1,Worst thing I ever seen,This has to be the worst thing I ever seen. He twists things around so much its hard to tell which parts are facts and what are lies. I would rather have seen a more honest aproach at this. If you want to show Bush is a bad light don't twist the truth and use half truths.
1,Fahrenheit 9/11 is a joke,"WARNING: SPOILERFahrenheit 9/11 is all lies constructed by Michael Moore. It is funny that Moore states that ""there is no terrorist threat"" when the title of his ""documentary"" makes use of the largest terrorist attack on the US ever. A funny example of his lies: the speech in which President Bush thanks his ""elite base"" actually occurred. But Moore failed to show the rest of the speech and state the environment that Bush made it in. The speech was at a dinner sponsored by the Catholic Church and Gore was in attendance as well. Traditionally at this dinner, politicians make speeches that mock themselves. Bush mocked himself and Gore mocked himself also. But does Moore point this out...no. Spend your money on FahrenHYPE 9/11 instead...it debunks all the lies and fabrications that Moore creates. http://www.fahrenhype911.com/"
3,Important Movie but Flawed,"Since when is highlighting the truth of what is really happening called Anti-American? I'll tell you what is Anti-American.....all those who are constantly striving to silence critics of an administration that is ruining our country. Since when did it become ""unpatriotic"" to express opposing views? I just find it so ironic that we are ""spreading freedom"" by occupying countries, destroying their culture, and controlling their airwaves. Watch the movie. It is sometimes slow and Moore can be a little much at times, but it has some very powerful scenes. This is definitely not a documentary because it does not provide enough (or any) opposing viewpoints. But....at least we are getting a different perspective than the mirage displayed by Fox News and the conservative controlled networks that gave a free pass to Bush for WAYYYYY too long."
5,An eye opener,"Fahrenheit 9/11 is movie that I have been wanting to see and I am glad that I did. Many people believe that Michael Moore is slanted, but much of is facts out for people to be able to discover for themselves. Myself, I never realized that recruiters will target people in poorer areas to join up. I think that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a movie that makes the viewers think not about the war but our whole system and if it is really fair and equal for every one."
1,Michael Moore is FULL of it!,The last thing America needs right now is Michael Moore's garbage! President Bush is the one of the best men to ever lead america! He is a good man who is not some slick lying cheatin fool who betrays his wife. This film is no good and I view it as anti-american and I think Bush is no perfect person either but I don't think that a president deserves a movie like this. Hollywood better get used to it because Bush is going to be re-elected in 2004 and will go another four years and there is no way that pretty boy Edwards and left wing Kerry are going to be elected in. George Bush will be president until 2008 no matter what Michael Moore thinks!
1,"Yawner, a waste of time...like Moore!","This is truly a crock-u-mentary...the ""facts"" are flawed hyperbole surrounded by slick garbage. Don't waste a penny on this trash..."
1,What a joke,"Well what can I say Except PLEASE if you are going to be disrespectful to our president at least you could try to be accurate.I have a thought since Michael Moore is so unhappy here He should go live in Iraq or Iran and how about this since you think that this war is so unnessary why don't you donate all the BLOOD money your making off of this ""film ""and as use that term losely to all the families and solders.I am shocked at the disrespect you Mr Moore show to america as a whole."
5,Fantastic and mind blowing.,"An amazing movie, that was a real eye opener. The only issue I had with it was how bummed out it made me."
5,Frustrating....IT IS THE TRUTH,"I knew who I was voting for before I saw this movie and it reinforced everything I knew and believed. I am not very proud to live in a country led by a president who has killed thousands of innocent and at least a 1,000 plus of our own soldiers...if you are voting for Mr.Bush again this year (he should have never been president in the first place...what a shame) I STRONGLY urge you to see this movie and see why we need a new leader for this country- someone who knows what he is talking about and knows how to lead a country."
1,I finally watched this one on cable.,"It's obvious that Michael Moore hates President Bush with a passion. It's also obvious that this clearly anti-Bush propaganda film was completely ineffective in taking any votes away from Bush in his 2004 re-election bid.Or, if this pseudo-documentary WAS effective, then Bush would have actually gotten even MORE than the 62-million votes he received had it not been released? Interesting.Speaking of elections, my favorite part of this entire film was watching Vice President Al Gore telling the mostly black congresswomen protesting the election certification to sit down and shut-up unless they could get at least one Democratic Senator to agree with their protest. They couldn't. Gore seems almost contemptuous of their efforts to keep his presidential bid alive. He looks almost embarrassed. But I guess Michael Moore didn't notice that, or why would he have included it in a film that was supposed to be blasting Bush?"
1,Garbage,This movie is so stupid and one sided. You can tell a democrat made it. I think it is funny that I saw this movie for sale at wal-mart in the $3.88 pile. Shows how much it stinks. Bush won the 2004 election so this didn't help the democrats at all. Nice try Mikey.
1,answer,"""Now, just for fun, write a 500-word essay distinguishing between Michael Moore and Osama bin Laden -- in the thought department. Could a reasonable citizen possibly wonder whether or not Michael Moore was giving aid and comfort to the enemy? ""I don't need 500 words. I just need this - Michael Moore is different from Osama bin Laden because Michael lives and still remains in the country that he hates so much and benefits off of his government by making millions. Apparently he is above the country morally, but something about 7 figures a year + 2 mansions, keeps him here."
1,Just a tip of the iceburg.,"Though this movie is a bit more than the typical bs you watch on tv, it doesn't really tell us all of the truth either.Moore just ripped off parts of what Alex Jones does. Alex Jones is the original reporter who uncovers the whole new world order and all the conspiracies related to it. For example you don't see Moore talking about how the pentagon was hit by something other than a plane and how the WTC and Oaklahoma buildings had more to their demolitions than the public is aware of. Those are the things that really matter.When Moore was asked by Alex Jones himself why he does not talk about any of the new worlder order issues, Moore said ""it's unAmerican"". So It's unAmerican to talk about the truth? I guess it's only ""patriotic"" if you remain ignorant about reality and do not question anything.Unlike Moore, Alex Jones is not in it for the money. He clearly states you can copy his films all you want."
1,Moore preys on less sophisticated youth,Hitler used similar film methods in 1930s to rile up the youth of Germany. Lies and more lies twist the mind of the youth while thundering music plays behind vivid scenes. Take some time to look at the Hitler movies and you will see uncanny parallels to Moore's style. The means justify the ends. The ends are questionable.
1,Garbage,"Any moron can slice and dice newsclips to fit their ""alternate view of reality"" - it's a pity that liberals are to stupid to take an objective view of current events."
5,F%CK _THE_ SYSTEM,"THIS MOVIE IS VERY INFORMING AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE ""SUPPORT OUR TROOPS"" FOOLS THEN DONT WATCH THIS. ITS YOUR FAULT YOU IDIOTS! YOU SHOULDNT OF SIGN UP TO THE ARMY IN THE FIRST PLACE. I MYSELF THINK WAR IS POINTLESS AND SICKENING. AND THIS IS COMMING FROM A METAL HEAD! MIKE MOORE IS A BRILLIANT MAN AND THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE! BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE IS BETTER IN MY OPINION. IF YOU LIKED THIS FLICK THEN CHECK OUT BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. AND PLEASE DONT BE A FOOL TO THE ROTTEN SYSTEM."
1,0 Stars Garbage,"The biggest lie in this movie slipped past just about everybody. Michael Moore says in this movie, not a documentary, that we attacked a country that never killed an American. How did everyone forget the attack by an Iraqi jet using French made weapons, two exocet missiles, fired from a French made mirage jet fighter on the USS Stark that killed thirty-seven sailors March 17, 1987 ? That was an act of war that was never really settled. Shame on you all."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:For every good point he scores, Moore finds six bad ones--you don't need to be a conservative to find this is a very poor piece of filmmaking and, frankly, quite a bit of a bore."
4,More from Moore!,"The puckish Mr. Moore freely skewers President Bush as he mercilessly exposes the calculated path that led the United States to where it is today. Although the conservative media has complained that the film is tilted and one sided, it's no more unfair than listening to an hour of G. Gordon Liddy or being exposed to Rush Limbaugh three hours a day ad infinitum. This film also shows Moore's growth as a film maker deftly mixing the (unintentional) comedy of the current administration with the sadness of a mother who lost a son in Iraq and showing the desparation the armed forces are experiencing in their quest for additional cannon fodder. A good diversion!"
5,Less violence on screen than I was led to believe,"I almost didn't go to see this because I had been told there were a lot of mangled bodies of Iraqi women and kids and maimed American soldiers. Well, there is some of that, but it's perhaps 10 minutes total in a two-plus-hour film. This takes the high points of everything I have gathered about Bush and the war over the past couple of years and puts it into a video package. It's even funny in spots, which is a good trick given how grim the subject is. Take a friend to see this."
3,Too Biased and One-Sided But Entertaining,"I dont really care much for politics, I am non-partisan. It seems like the movie only shows one point of view and it's 100% negative against Bush. Moore revealed a lot of interesting stuff but it's hard to validate the facts until you get the other side of the story. A lot of stuff seems to be taken out of context. Moore made himself look like those close-minded right wingers except he is on the left wing. Politics has always had an ""Us vs Them"" mentality which makes it a big joke."
5,Love it!,"""Fahrenheit 911"" is a totally objective, fair, balanced, and completely non-partisan look at the Bush White House. When I left the theater, I didn't see Moore as a liberal or a conservative. Moore is just a concerned American who just wants to tell the truth. Having said that, he did a good job with this movie, which is a must-see."
1,A Bunch of Lies,I've never seen anything so cleverly edited to present only one side of issues. The total goal of this film is to totally distort facts to impune our President. Anyone who sees this film and allows their opinion to be influenced is foolish. Mr Moore has a vendetta against Mr. Bush and will do or say anything to bring him down. I cannot recommend such a destructive and one sided film.
1,"More of Moore's twisted ""truth""","Some of this is true and some twisted to make who he wants to lokk bad, typical Moore"
1,Definition of Propaganda is,"Fortunately we do not live in a country where the government makes us watch movies like this, otherwise Moore would be no different than Joseph Goebbels. Instead we have the choice of whether or not to believe most of the main stream when they pass this off as credible (running endless commentaries on it, giving it credence and massive exposure). As the previous poster said, watch this and FarenHYPE 911 side by side and see which one YOU believe.[...]"
2,Truly Disappointing,"I came in to the movie with an open ear, but I was afraid this movie would be a mess and my fears came true. Moore is a terrible documentarist. This movie is erratic, incoherent, and sometimes just plain pointless. The way Moore uses war images and people crying to ""move"" the audience is cringe-worthy. I thought the one thing that would at least entertain me during this movie were the funny Bush screw-up scenes, but it actually ended up being the middle half of the film where Moore ties in the Bush family's relation to the Saudis. This was eye-opening material and if Moore had decided to stick this subject for the entire movie and make it a true documentary it could have been something very important. Instead we are stuck most of the time with Moore's annoying narration and images that tell us nothing new."
5,See the movie and Read the Book,"This film could've easily been renamed as ""Dude, Where's My Country?"" the movie. F-911 is a summarized version of that book. Within the book, he is able to back up every fact from legitimate news sources like the New York Time, USA Today, The Washington Post, and ABC News.I've read the necessary anti-Moore book as well ""Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man"" and most of their references come from unreliable sources like the internet.I understand that his views are liberal but let's remember that the Webster's definition of liberal is ""Not narrow or contracted in mind; not selfish. Not bound by orthodox tenets or established forms in political or religious philosophy; independent in opinion; not conservative.""That's what I'd wanna be."
2,"A well-made film, but far from factual.","I watched this film hoping that unknown facts would be revealed about both the war in Iraq and the events surrounding the attacks of 9/11. What I found instead was a humorous propaganda film. I was disappointed by the way Moore takes advantage of misconceptions and ""creatively"" edits certain parts of the film to reflect his personal political ideologies. Among other things, his claims that the Bush administration sheltered and flew the BinLaden family out of the country after the attacks of 9/11 were proven to be false by the 9/11 Commission. No matter what your political views may be, a half-truth is equivilent to a lie no matter who tells it. It is a well-done movie, but be objective when you view it."
1,What a Bunch of sdl;fkdsfsalfks,"This is a man who goes all over the world telling everyone how awful we Americans are and all you idiots pay to see his movie. He is not even an American and the shirt he has on the book cover is the next thing to blasphemy!!! I think you braindead folks should ask for a refund. Check out the facts. He used many things to connect Bush, Cheney, etc to many things but failed to put them in the right context and date order. Or just left that info out. And as for the Fox and Friends New, it is far better to listen to them than to the way the local channels have a way of spinning things to support their candidate.You people should spend your money on something better than supporting a person who hates our country so much. He is nothing but a disgusting piece of trash!!!"
1,Half truths,"Half truths and editing to help push personal feelings. Don't really care for this movie, sad someone in Iraq may believe this heep!!!"
2,Great fabrication of our president,The only reason this movie deserves 2 stars is because the editing is well done. But if you really believe this movie is all truth then you don't deserve the right to vote. Almost EVERY WORD of Bush's is taken extremely out of context.
1,This movie should be censored,"As a proud American, gun-owner, and Neo-conservative drone, I am appalled that this movie is being shown in this great nation's movie theaters. What in the name of Ronald Reagan's corpse is this fatboy thinking? If you don't agree with our great President blindly, then just move back north to Mexico, you stupid liberal.I for one am calling for all great Americans to boycott and censor this movie. Censorship has gotten a bad rap throughout history, but it should be used in careful consideration when dangerous material is available to the public that allows Joe Schmoe to think in views contrary to what the President thinks. And since our great President has a 5th-grade education, pretty much everything should be censored now.Please America, think about your children. Avoid this movie, lest your blonde-haired, blue-eyed kids grow up to be non-Americans. And if your kids aren't blonde-haired and blue-eyed, then go back to the country you came from (most likely Hawaii)."
1,Sad,"It is sad that too many people accept this propaganda as fact, when it is just the make believe world of an ego-maniacal man, who does not have the courage to run for office himself. Why should he? Much easier to sit back and critize those who serve our country while raking in millions pretending to be a ""man of the people."""
5,The Best! Moore does it again!,"Michael Moore is again out there fighting for middle america. My wife and I saw F9/11 at a local theater, and were pleased that we were turned away on the 5th night because it was still sold out. We walked away elated, not frustrated. When we finally saw the movie, it was very hard-hitting. Information that was gathered from newsreel and public documents. It's all there. Moore uses a little bit of his schtick in D.C. trying toget Congressional offspring to sign up for Iraq, but all in all, he showed that the president and family are not forthcoming in most aspects of their lives. The coverup of Halliburton and Saudi connections is very real and available.Hey! All of you naysayers, even if it's 90% or 80% true, which factcheckers were utilized to make SURE that it was not faulty information, then it's STILL a SCARY REALITY that our President could be sickenly outside of the public interest."
1,"Where's the truth, Mr. Moore?","Unreal. This ""documentary"" is filled with so many half-truths and deceptions that is leaves you speechless. Moore is, by his own admission, on a mission to oust President Bush, no matter the cost. Leaving all pretense of balance aside, he picks and chooses and distorts to paint a picture of Bush that ends up looking nothing like the real man. If you are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, you will love this film. If you are conservative or an independent thinker, you will see this for what it is . . . a cheerleading film for liberal-minded folks."
1,Below Average Mock Documentary,"While I love the concept of the mock documentary, F-911 falls flat. It just doesn't compare to other mock documentaries such as Spinal Tap or The Blair Witch Project.Spinal Tap was a genuinely funny movie, where as F-911's attempts at humor just come off as petty. And Blair Witch was considered very realistic and had many people believing it was a true story.Of course, anyone with even minimal intelligence could see that F-911 was completely ficticious, and since then most 'points' made by Moore in his movie have been proven to be lies, doubletalk and baseless speculation.If you want to see a good mock documentary, go see Tap or BWP."
1,Even morons have first amendment rights,"While I think Michael Moore is an absolute idiot, and his ""documentary"" nothing more than a collection of lies, half- truths and out of context quotations creatively assembled in the editing room, I must applaud and respect the fact that we, as Americans have the right to speak our opinion, however biased and mean spirited they may be. One can only hope that the truly enlightened will see this movie for the waste of film stock and electricity it truly is. Better yet, they will know what to expect from Mr. Moore and not have to put themselves through the ordeal of watching this trash."
1,Fahrenheit 9/11 = pathetic lies,"This has to be the one of the worst videos ever, from the choppy editing, quotes taken out of context, to the ""jump to conclusion without any facts"" logic Moore voices throughout the film.Good article to reference for facts disputing Moore's scandalous attempt at character assassaination can be found[...]"
1,"no, not even 1 star","A long boring drawn out political veiw of someone too fat to experience the lighter side of life. A total BORE. No politicaly cohesive and correct unbiased views. All rhetoric, no balance. Mike would SUCK in a debate class!"
2,Half Baked Half truths,"This film has some elements of truth in it. It also has many skewed and inaccurate and deliberately manipulative scenes. The best review was by a liberal published in Slate magazine http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723. The film Michael Moore should have made is ""911 in Plane Site."" Review this film http://www.911inplanesite.com/ and related topics at http://physics911.net/ as well as www.prisonplanet.com and related sites to get a glimpse of the truth. This film is mostly fluff and fairytale and misleading."
1,PURE DEMOCRATIC PROPEGANDA!!!,"One of the things that really irks me about this country is that people will believe anything if they see it on television or hear it on the radio. Michael Moore has this country right where he wants it....in his back pocket!!! Don't give this fool money because all you're doing is helping him to lie to us more than he already is.Thankfully, President Bush won another term, and proved that there might be hope for this country yet! I was very glad that John Kerry lost his bid for the Presidency because it means that people are starting NOT to believe the CRAP that the Democrats are shoveling!America....PLEASE wake up and smell the B.S.!!! Don't let somebody tell you what you should be thinking. THINK FOR YOURSELVES!!! God bless America, and President Bush!"
5,The Truth American Media Has Overlooked,"First of all, this is not a mere propaganda film based on fiction to enrage the public. It is based on fact. Fact confirmed by the United States 9/11 Commission.This is an excellent movie regardless of your political views. Republicans say they hate this movie before seeing it, because it is against President George Bush. Everyone should be open to the truth. Not against it because of their political offiliation.This is a must see for all people."
5,"just for balance, a review that isn't psychotic","Since about half the people who've reviewed Fahrenheit 9/11 so far seem to be paranoid schizophrenics, I thought I'd just throw in another reveiw in on the sane side of the balance. Now that we're more or less even, why don't we wait until we actually SEE the movie before commmenting on it?"
5,Brilliant!!!,"Unlike many of the reviewers so far, I have actually seen this film. Whether or not you like Michael Moore's politics and the tactics he uses to express himself, you have to admit that this is a highly effective and compelling movie! He is a brilliant filmmaker and completely deserving of the recognition he received at Cannes and he SHOULD receive an Oscar in 2005. Please see the movie before you post a review here so that people reading the ratings actually see movie reviews instead of ignorant and unfounded attacks on this film."
1,FarenHYPE 911 Totally Debunks Moore's Lies,"For the real truth, gotta see this factual documentary. Hear what Democrats such as Ed Koch and Zell Miller think of Moore. Get an inside look at the Clinton White House and Sandy Berger compliments of Dick Morris. Listen as the young soldier who lost both arms and was included, without his knowledge or permission, in Moore's propaganda film really thinks of Moore. Same thing for that Oregon State Trooper. And the principal of the school President Bush was visiting the day of the attacks. Odd that Amazon.com does not sell it. (...)"
1,You can't choose lower than 1 star,Liberals complain about right-wing lies. What do you think this movie is? A WASTE OF TIME
1,The demon-eye camera effects have to go,"I was not overly impressed by the movie. Most of the 'facts' were distorted or reported out of context, but I fully expected that.What annoyed me the most, however, was the 'demonizing' camera tricks used. Nearly every clip with Bush or any administration figure was edited so the persons eyes looked almost totally black. I wasn't expecting this and it really detracted heavily from the movie."
1,Propaganda,"This film is entirely biased. He act as if its the truth but if you take the time to research it yourself its just propaganda for his point of view. Watch it for the sake of entertainment, but don't think its 100% fact. Most people will see this film and see it as a documentary and thats what he's going for. I'm just saying don't jump on the ""anti-Bush bandwagon"" because its cool, do your own research and you will realize this is just a movie. For entertainment purposes it holds its own, its funny, but its not the truth."
1,Total Trash,one of the worst lies i have ever heard of.would rather see a story of Unfit for command on Kerry.
1,Michael Moore is ultimate scum,"It's nice to note that Moore would like to see American troops dead, very nice guy.Perhaps we would all be better off if Moore was in the twin towers on that horrible day. How quickly we all forget.Whatever your point of view, please realize this is not a documentary.No matter your opinion, Support the troops!"
3,A Review,"Zany comedian Michael Moore delivers more laughs in Farenheit 9/11, his newest screwball comedy. The latest in Moore's series of ""mockumentaries"", it pokes fun at everything from politics to the War on Terror. While it has some hilarious moments (the highlight is Moore, obviously in a fat suit, pursuing passersby), it tends to drag and some of the humor will be lost on those of us who aren't politicians.However, it has been reported that Congress loves it, and it is at times a howlingly hilarious spoof of political films. For those reasons it gets 3 out of 5."
1,Complete bunk,"This movie is a successful attempt at getting rich off of a controversial decision to go to war to liberate Iraq from a murderous dictator. Moore is a liar, a fraud, and an admitted enemy of the American people. He had capitalized on the natural fear that people experience whenever they are at war....& yes, people, we are at war."
1,Far Left Lunacy,"A movie only the French and the Hollywood Left could love, the maniacal ravings of a Bush-bashing, anti-American lunatic. This crock-umentary is a spinfest of half-truths, distortions and outright lies. Comrade Moore's fantasy audition for Minister of Propaganda in the Kerry Politburo. Thank God the American people had enough sense to see this phony huckster for what he really is."
5,WE ALL Know It's True!,"My Aunt and Uncle are wealthy life long Republicans and THEY even hate Bush. When I first heard that they had seen and approved of this movie and that , for the first time EVER they would NOT vote GOP for President this year I thought I'd wandered into the Twilight Zone, but not only have they lost money under Bush/Cheney they also have teen age Grandsons they would like to see NOT have to go to WAR!Those opening scenes that show him darting his eyes around are CHILLING! He looks like a madman! That film was not altered , he really IS an idiot!"
1,Many inaccurate statements. Lacks valid references/sources.,"Honesty in writting is important. There were several statements or assertions in this book that are know false to me. As a novel or work of fiction, this book would be acceptable but I think the author means to put forth these stories as fact or at least possibilities. He doesn't seem to present valid references or sources for his claims and in many cases his writing borders on fabrication. All in all, I gave him a low grade, for he seems rather partisan and unballanced in his presentation of information."
1,Don't waste your money,They say there's a sucker born every minute. Apparently Mr Moore knows this all too well as he is raking in the cash from those foolish enough buy this leftist garbage.
5,You Can't Make This Stuff Up!,"People may have a range of opinions about Michael Moore, but there is no denying actual footage that somehow never made it to our television screens. To watch George Bush sit for SEVEN minutes in a classroom, with a deer-in-the-headlights look, after being informed that America was under attack is to know the true essence of the man. To see him address contributors at a fundraiser as ""the haves and the have mores"" is revolting. Forget Michael Moore---just watch the footage and ask yourself if you can honestly place our nation in George Bush's hands for four more years."
4,The Fox News of Leftys,"This is a good move if you are looking to laugh at the man with no plan George Dubbyaa. But i think it was a little too one sided, like fox news--Loaded junk, but unlike fox news this junk is funny. See it, laugh and enjoy but dont think it all as said. its a movie not a history book, and it does not give all sides of the story. Even if you are for Bush you must see it, its a funny movie."
3,Shocked: not by Bush but by the pictures of the war,"I just recently watched this movie, not out of any sort of want on my own behalf, but because all my family and friends raved at me to do so. As the wife of a soldier serving in Iraq I feel very passonaitly about photo and vidoe clips from the war. I thought that the news was bad enough! Just a warning to anyone who may be sensitive to seeing very dramatic images of war and soldiers:DO NOT WATCHAs far as the political side of the movie, that was great. I just wish I could have fast forwarded through the nasty parts."
5,Democrats Aren't Ostriches,"Michael Moore has a history of filming the truth, just as the ultra-conservative Republicans of this nation have a history of lies. Instead of pointing fingers at Michael Moore, past presidents, or John Kerry, I challenge anyone to counter the basic tenets of Mr. Moore's film. Can't do it? Perhaps, just perhaps, it's the truth. STOP burying your head in the sand -- get this slimy administration OUT! GREAT FILM!!"
4,Docutainment,"Michael Moore is an unapologetically terrible person. I am disgusted by his shameless exploitation of greif to sell a political message. He is also unapologetically in love with himself, as evidenced by pulling this film from the Best Documentary category in hopes of winning a Best Picture Oscar.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a muddle, and the viewer is never entirely sure whether the film is accurate. It also meanders from point to point haphazardly.So why the four stars? Because this is a fantastically entertaining movie. I don't care how accurate Moore's research is, I don't care how self-indulgent the man is, and I don't care how overhyped this movie is. It is still worth a watch, and is worth more than a little attention. While Moore's politics are certainly exaggurated, his point is a valid one, and should be a caution to any concerned citizen."
1,Pure Propaganda,"It's very easy for a director to twist truths to convey a particular point of view. All Moore has to do is selectively focus on and magnify events and interviews that back up his point of view while ignoring massive evidence to the contrary. And, hey while you're at it, why not only show clips of those you disagree with that are unflattering.They should get some ugly close-ups of Moore stuffing his plump face with a Big Mac, food particles flying out of his mouth, and then have the caption underneath read, ""Michael Moore supports corporations that are making our kids fat and destroying their health!"" Hey, other filmmakers could play the same game too...There is so much evidence against Moore's points in this movie it's ridiculous.Hardly a ""documentary"". I might have given great review had it presented the topic without such an absurd left-leaning slant. Please file it under the topic ""Propaganda"" not Documentary.Maybe he should do some film work for Fidel Castro."
2,Is he a hero or a shill,"I have questions about the Moore bandwagon, but NOT as a Bush supporter. I mean, like Alex Jones asked in his video, why didn't Moore talk about Norad standing down in his movie. When Moore was asked this by Jones he just shrugged and said that would be un-American.How is that consistent with someone who is supposed to be investigating the real facts? I really don't get it.So with that in mind, I think there are a lot of better movies out there on the subject."
5,Critics Miss the Point,"The real point of Michael Moore's documentary is that the mainstream media missed 90% of the story about 911. They showed Bush hugging a fireman and refused to ask the tough questions. Whether you are conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican, this is a must see. In the feel good atmosphere of the post-911 days, when everyone was an American it was the responsibility of the media to go beyond the ribbons, flags, pomp, and circumstance, and report the news. They failed miserably. The media has willingly handed over their ""watchdog"" role and it is up to those like Moore to get behind the scenes and ask the questions. The fact that it is hilarious only adds to the film's appeal."
5,Amazing Movie,"First off, this movie is surprisingly funny in many parts.But yes, it is a partisan movie aimed at showing the truth about Bush and his administration.I think this movie succeeds as it carefully builds on a set of facts to support Moore's point of view. You may disagree with the conclusions, but the facts are unimpeachable. It's interesting to see three years of events condensed into two hours. Only then does the Bush White House get revealed for what it is.Politics aside, this movie is very well done. As others have said, go see the movie or buy the DVD no matter if you want to believe it or not. With educated voters, we all win."
2,Alex Jones did it earlier and better,"A lackluster ""dumbed down"" version of Alex Jones's key material on the subject, in my opinion. Mr. Jones even addresses this in his new movie. If you really want to learn the whole story, pick up an Alex Jones' movie."
1,Michael Moore needs a new job....,"If you have bought Fahrenheit 9/11 on DVD, then I strongly suggest you get a refund and get something a little more truthful. As he did in a similar scenario in F 9/11's predecessor, Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore attempts to pin the blame for the terrorist attacks on the WTC and Pentagon on everybody from President Bush to VP Dick Cheney and Halliburton through slickly edited interviews with people who lost loved loved ones in the 9/11 attacks and the war on terror in Iraq, as well as folks who just plain don't like Bush.Like a poor marksman, however, Moore keeps missing the real target he should be blaming: al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as those in our own government who did not pass along the information alerting the President to this situation. THEY are the ones that should be blamed for 9/11, and yet Moore points the finger at the Bush administration, judging them for all the evil in the world.Nice try, Moore, but I'm not buying."
2,Masterpiece of Propaganda,"Michael Moore has elevated himself to the league of rarified propagandists, most notably Leni Riefenstahl (who tried to convince us that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party were the good guys). Moore has no use for the truth. He cobbles together unrelated sound bites to ""prove"" his viewpoint. Like most rich liberals, he doesn't allow the facts to interfere with his perceptions. In short, don't waste your time with this film."
5,Fair and balanced,"What I appreciated most about the documentary was its fairness, the fact that it presented both sides, and gave the conservative side all the representation it deserved. It was made in a very fair and balanced way. How shameful that even with this very balanced, unbiased approach, Bush and the Repugs came out looking so awful."
5,Whether you agree or not it is a must see movie.,"It is amusing reading the reviews for this movie (on this site and off). Those who are ""against"" the Moore thesis generally throw out insults and epitaphs - with little or no evidence. Many admit to not having seen the whole film. It appears to be an emotional response based on faith and ignorance.Those that support the thesis - and this video have ample facts, sources and indeed, a rational approach to the mess that Bush made. The video may seem heavy handed at times...and it is certainly advocacy journalism, but it is not over the top or inaccurate.Whether you agree or not it is a must see movie."
5,Easily the most important film in years,"Forget all of the blindly negative reviews from people who never saw the film.JUST WATCH IT AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. While the filmmaker is undoubtedly opinionated, ALL of the facts check out, and conservatives have done all they can to discredit Moore as an extremist--AMAZINGLY, without addressing any of the charge layed out in the film.So...first see the film (before the election, preferrably), and if you don't believe it, visit michaelmoore.com for a LINE BY LINE fact-check including legit sources for all of the film's claims."
3,It interests me...,"People complain about Michael Moore's liberal hold of the truth, but then speak of other anti-Moore sites and books as the truth. Fascinating, really.The truth, as usually the case, lies more toward the middle. Moore doesn't necessarily lie, but he does take liberties with the truth and mislead, but honestly, he SHOULD! When you're making propaganda, the last thing you want to do is get bogged down my details. You lose the emotional effect of your audience when you do that. Ask Karl Rove and George W. Bush on that.Watch the movie and then independantly search the truth and forget all about michaelmoore.com and ihatemichaelmoore.com (persumably, there is one). You shouldn't blindly accept this movie as truth, but watch it as part of the process of questioning our President which we all need to do."
1,Fahrenhype 911 More like it!!,"This film is an example of how Hollywood can take facts and turn them for their own spin. Michael Moore does this in spades!He uses some facts and then turns them around for entertainment...not truth.An excellent DVD, if you've seen this picture, is ""Fahrenhype 911"". At least you will get more honest facts and not have them turned in a certain way to exploit your way of thinking with any regard for what's the truth.Michael Moore has a political agenda and he uses it to slant this film.If a film crew were to follow him around with their own agenda, they could make Michael out to be a right wing anorexic, with traditional values (using Michael Moores style of journalism)!If you look at this film for entertainment only...then it has some humorous moments and some shocking moments that could entertain...but that was not the goal of this film project and that is why this reviewer gives it one star at best!"
1,Fahrenheit 9/11 is Actually FarenCrap 9/11!,"I was really amazed that pictures & factual situations could be spliced, re-recorded and twisted to show fake scenes complete with words? After watching the actual scenes on TV, I don't know why somebody doesn't sue this guy? Anyway, if U are a liberal or mindless, & want to blame Pres Bush for everything in the world that has gone wrong, this might be enjoyable for U? If U are truly interested in knowing facts & world events, best buy Farenheip 9/11 or watch some Fox News, they show all sides of every story. I was pretty sick after watching this so called Documentary."
3,Why is this so different from the theatrical version?,"I first saw 9/11 in the theatre when it was released, and bought it when it came out on video. I was very surprised to find that the section where Lila Lipscomb visited Washington and had words with a Bush supporter was not in the movie.What gives?Dissappointing."
5,FAHRENHEIT REACHES NEW HEIGHTS,"WOW ! MICHAEL MOORE DOES IT AGAIN. ANOTHER GREAT FILM. HE TOTALLY EXPOSES THE BUSH ""ADMINISTRATION"" FOR WHAT IT IS(...)"
4,"Excellent Movie, but get Both Sides of the Story","Michael Moore always has a witty way to approach things such as his ice cream truck stunt (where he reads the PATRIOT act to congress through an ice cream truck's speakers because they didnt read it). It really get's you thinkin' which is good today because it seems that there is so much dribble on TV and in the movies, but his fight is very one-sided.I suggest that anyone, be you Republican, Democrat or Green, that see's this movie also read what the Republican-Conservative enemy has to say as well. Slander-By Ann Coulter is a pretty fierce Conservative book that combats many of the things people like Al Franken and Michael Moore say. Just do your own research as well as watch this movie and develop you own opinion to the topics it brings up."
5,EXCELLENT! FACTS ARE DOCUMENTED,"A must see for anyone interested in saving this country from another four years of Bush. Sadly, Mr. Moore would not have to make films like this if our national media would do its job. A lot of these things should have been reported in our newspapers and on our nightly newscasts."
1,"Not a documentary, too much bias obviously","This is just a film by Michael Moore in what appears to be a vendetta against George W Bush. It is interesting to watch ""Fahrenhype 9/11"" after watching this movie. Why does Moore have a section about the Oregon State Police when it is funded by Oregon State and not the federal government? The most appalling thing about this obvious piece of propaganda is that Moore claims he is behind and supports the soldiers in Iraq %100. Why is there not one positive image of a soldier throughout the entire film? He depicts them as uneducated, brutal savages for his own gain."
4,"Moore exaggerates his claims about the militrary and George W. Bush, but a good documentary none the less","This is a good documentary for the simple reason that it showed insight on the 2000 election and the second Iraq War. I still can't believe Gore lost the Presidency even though he really should of won. I was definitely against the war in Iraq and this documentary proves why it wasn't necessary. Although Moore points out the flaws in this country, some of his claims about the military are exaggerated."
1,From Barnum to Moore to 100 million suckers . . .,"If a documentary can be judged by any journalistic standards of accuracy and integrity, this one fails miserably. But as circuses go, it was barely entertaining; speaking metaphorically, you could ""see the strings."" Unfortunately Amazon.com doesn't have an option for less than one star."
1,"entertaining, but worthless","If there was a way to give less than one star, I would. The information given within this film is very onesided and biased. It is also just a little piece of the whole story. If you believe everything you see in the news, in print and in movies, such as this one, you are very poorly informed. If you are really interested, look into things more deeply and find the pieces of information that are true while throwing the rest out. Most of this film could just be thrown out. I see the things that have happened, and are happing, over here on a daily basis for the past 3 years and things are just not as the media and Michael Moore show. In the end it is all about making money and controversy is one of the easiest ways to do this. In this point, Michael Moore did a great job, he made a lot of money using complete fallacy and personal bias."
3,Entertainment value.... ha ha,"Okay, perhaps I am not exactly qualified to write a review on such a tender topic as American politics, coming from the land down under, But I have to make a comment. After watching F/911 I got the impression there was fun times had by all in the editing dept. I have seen some of the original interviews with Bush, and there is a lot of missing dialogue! Besides that, Does anyone really think that the masses would vote to keep a man in power for another 4 years who has supposedly lied and misled the people of America? Here in Australia we recently re-elected our leader- Prime Minister John Howard. Again, amid claims of lies and following old G B into war. In my opinion... keep up the good work boys!"
1,Please understand...,"...this is FICTION. Or at very least, it is a distortion of fact. Mr. Moore artfully splices together scenes and sound bites that do not belong together. He cleverly manipulates the viewer into feeling precisely what he wants them to feel; for that he deserves a star. I withhold the other stars based on the fact that Mr. Moore misleads his audience into believing that his presentation is factual."
1,dishonest treachery,no fewer than 59 lies/misdirections in this 'documentary'. it's sad to think of how many people bought into this garbage. educate yourself: [...]
2,Fahrenheit 9/11,We were quite disapointed in this. We believed from all the hype about how it attacked President Bush that the film would hit much harder than it did.
1,THis movie stinks!! Moore is an arrogant fool.,This movie was horrible. I couldn't even sit thru this disaster in the theatre. I was disturbed for days after i saw it that all this BS was being spoon fed to the public who'll believe whatever they hear. I just wish i could have been there to see Michael Moore cry and whine like a little girl when BUsh was reelected. So much work on one movie for no reason. Too bad buddy. How did this movie win a people's choice award??? it didnt even gross in the top fifteen of 2004--what a rigged award show. So go ahead and mark unhelpful..i wasn't goign for helpful
2,Michael Moor=A Voice of Truth?? Gimme a Break~,"You guys are tricked again, one before by the neoconsevertives, and now the liberals. You guys made MM rich, and that's about it.You know what the ""real"" problem is? Most of Americans believe that the mockumentary is telling the truth only. You're just as stupid as GWB Don't be offended by that. This insult(?) is nothing compared to what MM has done, and besides, I'm telling the truth.I'm not denying that MM is a skillful filmmaker, but he's not telling the whole truth in F911. I personally don't like GWB either, but this film is a propaganda fiction (with 50% truth)."
1,Guess it didn't change the tide of history,"I'm glad that the rest of America cannot be swayed by a left-wing propagandist the way Jeff Shannon can. There is a big country out there between NYC and San Francisco. All the Micael Moores, Al Frankens, and Whoopi Goldbergs out there cannot speak for the real Americans who voted in record numbers this year and basically told them to shut up."
2,Intellectual?,"I work on a military base as well and frankly, I was too busy to watch this when it first came out. Now that I did I wish I could have my time back. (I won't even get into the whole issue of whether this could even be considered a ""documentary"".)I love our country and the freedom it represents. I am proud that we are here in Iraq helping to bringing that same freedom to those who have been oppressed for years. Whether Mr. Moore choses to believe that or not, have him come make rounds with me when Iraqi women are hugging my neck and thanking me- then he can kiss my... well, you get MY picture."
1,Get A Life Michael,"Michael Moore's vendetta is beyond boring. Major holes can still be poked through his accusations making his ""fact checkers"" as fanatical as he is. Do us all a favor, Michael, and move to France.I gave this movie 1 star as I was required to enter a rating. This movie is a big zero."
1,Propaganda At Its Best,"When your reviewer (Jeff Shannon) says that Moore armed himself with a platoon of reputable fact-checkers to produce this ""provocative film"", I wonder what your reviewer was smoking. This is the worst attempt at a documentary that I have ever has the misfortune to view. It makes ""Rathergate"" and the CBS use of ""forged and falsified documents"" on 60 Minutes II seem tame. I would appreciate if your reviewer could name one of the reputable fact-checkers for the Amazon audience. I do have to admit that Mr Moore is ""rather"" funny as the lead clown in his film."
1,documentary?????,"How can a political piece be labeled a documentary? Creative editing is liberally employed, I did my homework."
1,Misrepresentation,"I have a problem with a movie that will present itself as outright fact that involves so much personal bias and speculation. I respect MM's right to make a movie about what he thinks, but I don't think this is the best way to do so, and think there were some below-the-belt ploys for emotional response that have nothing to do with the points he's trying to make."
1,Michael Moore must be a Nazi,"In short, Michael Moore is trying to make people hate republicans using the same techniques that the Nazis used in World War II to make the people of Germany hate the Jews, Catholics, Gypsies and many other people Hitler despised. There for Michael Moore must be a Nazi or a Communist."
5,THE HARD TRUTH,"This documentary is for people that can handle the truth,if you cant i suggest you don't view it.President bush has betrayed the American people and the men and women serving in the armed forces you may ask what betrayal he sold us out to the Saudis and for black gold"
1,Michael Moore(on) is CONFUSED....,"You know that seven minutes this *bleep* keeps harping about -- that has nothing to do with 9/11, that's how long it takes him to inhale seven slices of pizza!!!!I wouldn't give this *bleep"" one cent of my money to see his pack of celluloid lies. Go W!"
1,MOCKUMENTARY! Paranoid Delusional filmaker. Get a clue,"Talk about ""Angry White Man Syndrome""! Michael Moore has an extremely skewed perspective on reality. I don't know if I've ever seen an agrier movie. The fact of the matter is that the majority of this stuff is all speculative, or in other words conjured up. He has compiled footage, out of context I might add, in order to lead the viewer in Moore's little warped world. Yet, he has the gall to call this a documentary. What a great country we live in where any idiot with a camera can make a derogatory & fabricated movie about our Commander in Chief, call it a documentary & get away with it. GOD BLESS AMERICA! I hear that this movie is a favorite with Alqaeda. Maybe Mr. Moore would like to go overseas and hand them a personally signed copy. I'm sure they would be very appreciative."
1,Just The Facts - Well Maybe Someday,"Michael Moore has walked into this project, as he does with most of the films he makes, to prove his preconceived notions of what truth is. He takes facts and presents them very craftily to weave webs of unrelated incidents together in hopes of having the audience draw logistical conclusions that are pure propaganda - at its worst. Not so much a documentary, as a current day French Fairy Tale.;>)"
1,Should be illegal.,"This is a horrible movie. As an American Moore should have more respect for the man that represents our nation. Even if Moore doesn't agree or like Bush he should not have gone so far as to make such a film. Moore should be imprisoned for this film. I whatched about 30 minutes of the film and walked out, not because I support Bush(which I was nuetral about in the election) but because it is terrible and unamerican to do to our president. Just because you don't like him doesn't mean a movie should be made. Moore should had thought twice about making this film."
1,"Entertaining, yes. A documentary, no.","Michael Moore does what he does best in his latest effort. Each of his films has shown a greater degree of skill at obfuscation, distortion, and deliberate misinterpreting to make his point.Make no mistake, this IS an entertaining film. But it is also less credible as a documentary than John Wayne in 'Sands of Iwo Jima'.If you favor rational and logical thought, avoid this film, as it has none of those qualities. If you just want to be entertained while encouraging your irrational beliefs, this film is for you."
3,"Not the best propaganda, but adequate for the susceptible.","The film lacks any sense of visual style or sophistication.It bludgens the viewer with the simplistic viewpoint of thefilm maker.Too much time spent on whiney crying people, no time spentat all showing the WTC falling, but the target audience enjoys wearingthe hair shirt, and has opted out of independent thought.For real quality propaganda, Triumph of the Will is thegold standard against which all propaganda movies mustbe judged, and 9/11 falls sadly short."
2,A simple appetizer,"Ninety percent opinion, ten percent fact. For more in-depth analysis and much harder hitting investigation based on mainstream media reporting view any of Alex Jones' later films. 9/11: The Road to Tyranny, Martial Law: Rise of the Police State, and TerrorStorm are far better. Heck, you can view them all for free on Google and YouTube. Alex is a man so concerned with getting the word out that he releases all his works for free HIMSELF."
1,"Very unfair, but I still recommend watching it","Moore's film is basically a propaganda piece. He out right lies in this film. There are several things that moore had to know were not true, and could of corrected and didn't. However, I STILL RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE SEE IT. Then watch FarienHYPE 9/11, the rebuttal. Watch them both together. I believe in political speech, and I think you should hear what Michael Moore has to say. I encourage people to see it, just get the other point of view as well.The last time I check amazon didn't sell FarienHYPE-- but you apparently can rent it at Blockbuster and Hollywood video. I bought my copy at my local Best Buy. For more info go to www.fahrenhype911.com."
2,it was allright...,"The reason why I feel that this movie should receive only 2 stars is because all of the groundbreaking facts exposing the Carlyle group and connections to the Bush family that Moore uses were in a documentary made by Alex Jones a year earlier called 9/11 road to tyranny. Moore is a tool, right wing and left wing is horizontal thought. Think vertical, think of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and the truth of what the government, and its fourth branch, the media, is telling you. We are deciding between to candidates for President that are both skull and bones members, and from very wealthy families. If you think that Fahrenheit 9/11 woke you up, you are still asleep my friend. Moore is raking in millions for this movie, Alex Jones isn't, he put his movie out for free on the internet because he wanted people to know what's going on. Go to www.infowars.com or www.prisonplanet.com to see the truth. Watch 9/11 in Plane Sight, it will change everything..."
1,Ugh,"More lies, half-truths, and distortions from dysnfunctional, delusional sleazebag Michael Moore, and the gullible fools like the ""Amazon.com reviewer"" and most of the people (if that's the word for them) posting at these boards lap it up like mindless doggies. It's positively frightening to know that people like you actually get to vote, and will do it believing what Moore says about President Bush is true. If John Kerry, i.e. The Mortician, is elected, this country will look back on the Jimmy Carter era with nostalgia. You're a bunch of damn zombies. If Bush were the man Moore portrays in this amateurish piece of filth, Moore would have been shipped off to Bagdhad where he'd be beheaded. Then again, why behead a man whose head is useless, anyway."
1,Save your money to buy snake oil,"Oliver Stone did it with JFK, now Michael Moore does it on Bush. Manipulation of the facts and fiction is Moore's strength. I'd wait 20 years then watch this as a comedy... of errors."
1,Where's the facts,Micheal Moore has a long history of subverting the facts for dramatic presentation. This is just another example. If you dare you can learn the facts and see how things were twisted in Moore's film; Check some of these sources: www.newsmax.com website; the book and soon to be film Fahrenhype 9/11. Or the Book Micheal Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man (which mocks Moore's book Stupid White Men) The responsibility of living in a free society is to learn the real facts. Don't believe anything you read or hear until you can verify it with lots of sources. Read every side of an argument and you might find the real facts. Good luck.
5,Mandatory for all Americans,"It's funny to see all these 1 star reviews, considering no one has come out to disprove any of the facts in this film. All they have is a number of poorly written books and subpar movies that only offer opinions of Michael Moore's large bodily frame.This isn't the America I once knew. Damn neo-cons"
1,Just more Michael Moore,Once again Michael Moore plays fast and loose with his agenda driven version of the truth. His slick editing and questionable interviewing techniques often leave one with more fiction than facts. Moore is very aware of his audiences biases and plays upon them for maximum effect.
1,the illegitimate love child of tokyo rose and baghdad bob,"I've seen fahrenheit 9/ll and fahrenhype 9/11, and I don't understand how anyone, after seeing these two movies, can still believe michael moore.which leads me to this conclusion: michael moore doesn't scare me, it's the people that believe michael moore that scare me! michael the narcissist was convinced he would influence the 2004 election, and I'm sure he did, but not in the way he thought he would. his plan back fired when republicans came out in large numbers as an answer and antidote to the ""ego"" and his propaganda, and elected bush. this is required viewing only for those that believe in every dark, sinister, conspiracy theory that comes down the pike. their latest? bush engineered 9/11, he's behind it all, all the while calling him incompetent, so which is it? an evil genius or a fumbling boob? keep an open mind, and watch both movies [including celsius 41.11], and decide for yourself."
1,Documentary?,"This was about as much a documentary as a Doonesbury comic. If it had been touted as ""opinion"" or ""editorial"" I would have given it a higher review."
1,TOTAL LACK OF OBJECTIVITY,"After watching this documentary, I had the following impressions:The only good point made was the critique pertaining to getting rid of Saddam Hussein. The rest of documentary is TOTAL NONSENSE.Athiban Thamban"
1,What a terribly boring and false movie,"This movie was terribly boring. I went with two die-hard liberals and a conservative; everyone but me was asleep for more than half of this movie! Not to mention if you did research you would discover the truth behind this movie. It is founded upon lies, misconceptions, and a twisted view of the truth. Michael Moore has lost all respect and reliability as a movie-maker. This movie should not be filed under documentary, it should be filed under historical fiction. Roger and Me was a good movie. Some of his other work was enjoyable. This film shows Michael Moore falling to a horrible low."
5,Outstanding work,"In a world where the media has decided to turn its back and sold the American People to the deceptions and perfidy of oil industry, Michael Moore has risen above the storm and brought reality back into the spotlight.Michael Moore has not been fair to the Military since majority of men in uniform hold on to the core values of excellence, integrity, and service to the nation. Nevertheless, the movie is very informative and should be seen by every patriotic American who wants to know what is wrong with our nation."
4,A Thread of Discontent,As a Bush supporter in 2000 it didn't take me long to realize I made a mistake. Remember Forrest Gump's line about a box of chocolates? Presidential candidates are the same. If the movie only contains 10% of truth it's quite an indictment on the Bush Administration. Certainly the parts of the film that don't lie are clips of Bush himself. I always had the uneasy feeling that he was a person in over his head. The film obviously strikes a chord with the American people. If the chord didn't exist there wouldn't be any hype or controversy over this movie. There wouldn't be this movie. The chord is of course the thread of discontent which the people have for our current president. See through the film for it's biased propaganda but also see and contemplate the unbiased vulgarity in the truth of it's pictures.
1,Mockudrama,"Moore uses the hammer of partisan demagoguery to pound another nail into the coffin of the once-venerable documentary. There's so much to criticize our government about, yet Moore feels it is necessary to mislead and distort the facts. I wouldn't hold this movie up as a shining example of First Amendment rights; using Moore's standards of free speech, all of the evil politicians and corporations are exercising their freedom of speech to mislead and distort, and anyone can be made to look incompetent or evil, even Moore. Moore has some good points to make, but he fights fire with fire. A documentary should be made about documentaries!"
4,4 out of 5 moments do their job,"You can say what you want about the facts or lack thereof, depending on your political position. I'm sure republicans believe it is all lies and dems say it's the truth.But what you cannot ignore are the words of the families and the soldiers. Words cannot describe what they are subject to, from recruiting up through coming home. Almost every vet I've met or talked to seems to be on the verge of tears. All I can say is that they deserve better.Disagree with whatever you will, you cannot ignore the testimony of the soldiers."
